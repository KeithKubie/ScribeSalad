of the intermediary in how people get

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800
of the intermediary in how people get
 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.280
of the intermediary in how people get
information and how advertisers find

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290
information and how advertisers find
 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.570
information and how advertisers find
their consumers and you know it was very

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580
their consumers and you know it was very
 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.230
their consumers and you know it was very
interesting to learn and just almost

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240
interesting to learn and just almost
 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.590
interesting to learn and just almost
inspiring to learn how much power

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600
inspiring to learn how much power
 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.450
inspiring to learn how much power
intermediaries have in determining the

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460
intermediaries have in determining the
 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.240
intermediaries have in determining the
kinds of information that you get at the

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250
kinds of information that you get at the
 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.820
kinds of information that you get at the
same time you could see over the course

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830
same time you could see over the course
 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.580
same time you could see over the course
I started in 2007 over the course of the

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590
I started in 2007 over the course of the
 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.500
I started in 2007 over the course of the
time that I was working there how the

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510
time that I was working there how the

changes in the way that people were

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330
changes in the way that people were
 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.390
changes in the way that people were
getting information was really impacting

the news media and as we know the news

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410
the news media and as we know the news
 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.640
the news media and as we know the news
media is one of the fundamental parts of

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650
media is one of the fundamental parts of
 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.100
media is one of the fundamental parts of
functioning democracies and so we start

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110
functioning democracies and so we start
 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.610
functioning democracies and so we start
to worry as well about whether we're

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620
to worry as well about whether we're
 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.409
to worry as well about whether we're
going to always be able to have the same

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419
going to always be able to have the same
 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:10.200
going to always be able to have the same
kinds of investigative journalism that

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210
kinds of investigative journalism that
 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.610
kinds of investigative journalism that
we've had in the past so you know the

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620
we've had in the past so you know the
 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.770
we've had in the past so you know the
the big stylized facts are that the

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780
the big stylized facts are that the
 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.480
the big stylized facts are that the
media the news media is under a lot of

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490
media the news media is under a lot of
 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.640

revenue classify it's got unbundled web
 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.570
revenue classify it's got unbundled web
avenues ad revenue is low and then we've

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580
avenues ad revenue is low and then we've
 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.490
avenues ad revenue is low and then we've
heard lessee newsrooms getting cut

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500
heard lessee newsrooms getting cut

newspapers going bankrupt and so on and

newspapers going bankrupt and so on and
the rise of a lot of new forms of ways

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610
the rise of a lot of new forms of ways
 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.300
the rise of a lot of new forms of ways
for people to get information and I

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310
for people to get information and I
 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.490
for people to get information and I
think

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500
think
 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.320
think
in this election season it's sort of

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330
in this election season it's sort of
 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.440
in this election season it's sort of
particularly salient when when it's been

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450
particularly salient when when it's been
 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.840
particularly salient when when it's been
widely observed that perhaps the the

changes in the way the news media works
and the changes in the way people get

and the changes in the way people get
 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.890
and the changes in the way people get
their messages out may have affected you

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900
their messages out may have affected you

their messages out may have affected you
know the way that the discussion has has

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360
know the way that the discussion has has

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110
occurred and the success of candidates
 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.860
occurred and the success of candidates
so this is sort of the chart of doom for

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870
so this is sort of the chart of doom for
 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:03.970
so this is sort of the chart of doom for
the news media

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:03.980
the news media
 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.690
the news media
this shows a newspaper ad revenue

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:06.700
this shows a newspaper ad revenue
 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.370
this shows a newspaper ad revenue
normalized in nineteen eighty dollars

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:09.380
normalized in nineteen eighty dollars
 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.330
normalized in nineteen eighty dollars
and sort of shows is you know the as the

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.340
and sort of shows is you know the as the
 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.310
and sort of shows is you know the as the
Internet becomes important the newspaper

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.320
Internet becomes important the newspaper
 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.080
Internet becomes important the newspaper
ad revenue sort of falling off a cliff

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.090
ad revenue sort of falling off a cliff
 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.570
ad revenue sort of falling off a cliff
and so you know this is just a really

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580
and so you know this is just a really
 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.280
and so you know this is just a really
highlight they I mean we should be

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:21.290
highlight they I mean we should be
 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:24.550
highlight they I mean we should be
concerned about the future in some sense

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560
concerned about the future in some sense
 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.159
concerned about the future in some sense
you know then the news media the fact

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:27.169
you know then the news media the fact
 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:29.110
you know then the news media the fact
that it was so profitable for a period

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120
that it was so profitable for a period
 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.090
that it was so profitable for a period
of time is perhaps what we should think

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:31.100
of time is perhaps what we should think
 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.770
of time is perhaps what we should think
about as kind of an accident of history

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:32.780
about as kind of an accident of history
 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.770
about as kind of an accident of history
and technology the newspaper newspapers

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:35.780
and technology the newspaper newspapers
 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.420
and technology the newspaper newspapers
are creating information goods it's

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.430
are creating information goods it's
 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.460
are creating information goods it's
fairly easy to copy information goods

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:39.470
fairly easy to copy information goods
 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.500
fairly easy to copy information goods
it's actually it would be kind of hard

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:41.510
it's actually it would be kind of hard
 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.659
it's actually it would be kind of hard
to protect your intellectual property

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:43.669
to protect your intellectual property
 

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:45.280
to protect your intellectual property
and in the context of news we have to

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:45.290
and in the context of news we have to
 

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:46.990
and in the context of news we have to
have constitutional protections freedom

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.000
have constitutional protections freedom
 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.659
have constitutional protections freedom
of speech that make it hard to keep

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:49.669
of speech that make it hard to keep
 

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:52.450
of speech that make it hard to keep
people from copying news and there was

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:52.460
people from copying news and there was
 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.250
people from copying news and there was
this this kind of moment in time where

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:54.260
this this kind of moment in time where
 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.080
this this kind of moment in time where
the news was delivered as a newspaper

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:56.090
the news was delivered as a newspaper
 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.330
the news was delivered as a newspaper
that bundled together lots of things and

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:58.340
that bundled together lots of things and
 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.280
that bundled together lots of things and
you had sort of a little local monopoly

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:00.290
you had sort of a little local monopoly
 

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:02.890
you had sort of a little local monopoly
over over local advertisers and could be

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:02.900
over over local advertisers and could be
 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.540
over over local advertisers and could be
quite profitable and so in some sense

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:04.550
quite profitable and so in some sense
 

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.460
quite profitable and so in some sense
we're gonna be may look back and say

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:06.470
we're gonna be may look back and say
 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:08.080
we're gonna be may look back and say
that was a very interesting and unique

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:08.090
that was a very interesting and unique
 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:10.000
that was a very interesting and unique
moment in time where there was a

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.010
moment in time where there was a
 

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:12.030
moment in time where there was a
profitable business model for news and

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:12.040
profitable business model for news and
 

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.800
profitable business model for news and
the rest of the time that comes after

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:14.810
the rest of the time that comes after
 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:16.600
the rest of the time that comes after
where it's much harder for that to be

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:16.610
where it's much harder for that to be
 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.510
where it's much harder for that to be
profitable maybe more of the normal

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:18.520
profitable maybe more of the normal
 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.550
profitable maybe more of the normal
state of affairs so what I'm going to

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:21.560
state of affairs so what I'm going to
 

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.440
state of affairs so what I'm going to
talk about today is I'm going to start

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:23.450
talk about today is I'm going to start
 

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:26.530
talk about today is I'm going to start
with a theory paper that I wrote that

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:26.540
with a theory paper that I wrote that
 

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:30.100
with a theory paper that I wrote that
tried to sort of think about how the

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:30.110
tried to sort of think about how the
 

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:31.570
tried to sort of think about how the
changes and how people consume

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:31.580
changes and how people consume
 

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.300
changes and how people consume
information affects advertising markets

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:34.310
information affects advertising markets
 

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.159
information affects advertising markets
and advertising revenue and then I'm

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:36.169
and advertising revenue and then I'm
 

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:38.380
and advertising revenue and then I'm
going to move into empirical work that

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:38.390
going to move into empirical work that
 

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:41.230
going to move into empirical work that
tries to uncover empirical facts about

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:41.240
tries to uncover empirical facts about
 

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.450
tries to uncover empirical facts about
how changes in how people get their news

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:43.460
how changes in how people get their news
 

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.730
how changes in how people get their news
affect what news people read and what

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:45.740
affect what news people read and what
 

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:49.010
affect what news people read and what
news outlets are advantaged

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:49.020
news outlets are advantaged
 

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.350
news outlets are advantaged
to start let me talk about the theory

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:51.360
to start let me talk about the theory
 

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.180
to start let me talk about the theory
and we're really gonna focus in on

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:53.190
and we're really gonna focus in on
 

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:55.670
and we're really gonna focus in on
consumer switching so we want to think

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:55.680
consumer switching so we want to think
 

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.369
consumer switching so we want to think
about two facts um the internet makes it

00:07:58.369 --> 00:07:58.379
about two facts um the internet makes it
 

00:07:58.379 --> 00:08:01.460
about two facts um the internet makes it
much easier for consumers to switch

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:01.470
much easier for consumers to switch
 

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:03.499
much easier for consumers to switch
between outlets they've sort of changed

00:08:03.499 --> 00:08:03.509
between outlets they've sort of changed
 

00:08:03.509 --> 00:08:05.629
between outlets they've sort of changed
your loyalty so you used to read one

00:08:05.629 --> 00:08:05.639
your loyalty so you used to read one
 

00:08:05.639 --> 00:08:09.170
your loyalty so you used to read one
newspaper and now you read many and so

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:09.180
newspaper and now you read many and so
 

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.999
newspaper and now you read many and so
that's not surprising that that might

00:08:10.999 --> 00:08:11.009
that's not surprising that that might
 

00:08:11.009 --> 00:08:14.029
that's not surprising that that might
change the way that markets work the

00:08:14.029 --> 00:08:14.039
change the way that markets work the
 

00:08:14.039 --> 00:08:15.770
change the way that markets work the
second that fact is that it's actually

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:15.780
second that fact is that it's actually
 

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.710
second that fact is that it's actually
hard to keep track of which consumers

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:18.720
hard to keep track of which consumers
 

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.719
hard to keep track of which consumers
have seen which ads across different

00:08:20.719 --> 00:08:20.729
have seen which ads across different
 

00:08:20.729 --> 00:08:23.469
have seen which ads across different
news outlets so just as a little bit of

00:08:23.469 --> 00:08:23.479
news outlets so just as a little bit of
 

00:08:23.479 --> 00:08:25.909
news outlets so just as a little bit of
fact around that course some people have

00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:25.919
fact around that course some people have
 

00:08:25.919 --> 00:08:28.670
fact around that course some people have
the feeling that what happens online is

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:28.680
the feeling that what happens online is
 

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.620
the feeling that what happens online is
like perfect and other people have the

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:30.630
like perfect and other people have the
 

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:32.480
like perfect and other people have the
stereotype that it's horrible so the

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:32.490
stereotype that it's horrible so the
 

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:34.040
stereotype that it's horrible so the
truth is actually sort of somewhere in

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:34.050
truth is actually sort of somewhere in
 

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:35.870
truth is actually sort of somewhere in
the middle so there are lots of cookies

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:35.880
the middle so there are lots of cookies
 

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.459
the middle so there are lots of cookies
out there that track your behavior and

00:08:37.459 --> 00:08:37.469
out there that track your behavior and
 

00:08:37.469 --> 00:08:39.409
out there that track your behavior and
try to keep track of where you've gone

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:39.419
try to keep track of where you've gone
 

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:41.810
try to keep track of where you've gone
and what ads you've seen but they only

00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:41.820
and what ads you've seen but they only
 

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:45.410
and what ads you've seen but they only
work sort of medium well so this is a

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:45.420
work sort of medium well so this is a
 

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:47.360
work sort of medium well so this is a
little chart showing data from an

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:47.370
little chart showing data from an

analysis for a company called comScore

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:49.140
analysis for a company called comScore
 

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:50.990
analysis for a company called comScore
and comScore has a panel of a couple

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:51.000
and comScore has a panel of a couple
 

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.240
and comScore has a panel of a couple
hundred thousand users that they and

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:53.250
hundred thousand users that they and
 

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:55.160
hundred thousand users that they and
they track for those users everything

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:55.170
they track for those users everything
 

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:57.319
they track for those users everything
that they do online and so what they

00:08:57.319 --> 00:08:57.329
that they do online and so what they
 

00:08:57.329 --> 00:08:59.750
that they do online and so what they
looked at was 30 large advertising

00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760
looked at was 30 large advertising
 

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.210

advertisers that had attempted to reach
 

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.829
advertisers that had attempted to reach
every consumer between three and eight

00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:06.839
every consumer between three and eight
 

00:09:06.839 --> 00:09:08.690
every consumer between three and eight
times and they could use state of the

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:08.700
times and they could use state of the
 

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.240

achieve that goal including use of

achieve that goal including use of
 

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.740
achieve that goal including use of
cookies and so on but what they found

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:15.750
cookies and so on but what they found
 

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:17.240

after they did the very best they could

after they did the very best they could

to reach users between three and eight

00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:18.959
to reach users between three and eight
 

00:09:18.959 --> 00:09:21.170
to reach users between three and eight
times is that actually half of their

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:21.180
times is that actually half of their
 

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.460

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:24.620

we're either given to users that saw one

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:24.630
we're either given to users that saw one
 

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:27.319
we're either given to users that saw one
or two ads early users that saw more

00:09:27.319 --> 00:09:27.329
or two ads early users that saw more
 

00:09:27.329 --> 00:09:29.480
or two ads early users that saw more
than eight ads and although this may

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:29.490
than eight ads and although this may
 

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:31.250
than eight ads and although this may
seem kind of arbitrary the industry

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:31.260
seem kind of arbitrary the industry
 

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.750
seem kind of arbitrary the industry

ad impressions so this is just to
 

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.530

what ads they saw so if I think about

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:44.720
what ads they saw so if I think about
 

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.540
what ads they saw so if I think about
now trying to bring those facts into

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:47.550
now trying to bring those facts into
 

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:49.519
now trying to bring those facts into
media economics so I should say

00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:49.529
media economics so I should say
 

00:09:49.529 --> 00:09:50.990
media economics so I should say
traditional media economics is

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:51.000
traditional media economics is
 

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.720
traditional media economics is
relatively new economists have only

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:53.730
relatively new economists have only
 

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:57.100
relatively new economists have only
really been building models of how

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:57.110
really been building models of how
 

00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:00.470
really been building models of how
advertising markets work for like 15 or

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480
advertising markets work for like 15 or
 

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.920
advertising markets work for like 15 or
20 years this is relatively new research

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:03.930
20 years this is relatively new research
 

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:05.750
20 years this is relatively new research
it's a theory the general theory is a

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760
it's a theory the general theory is a
 

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.870
it's a theory the general theory is a
theory of two-sided markets and so in

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:08.880
theory of two-sided markets and so in
 

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.850
theory of two-sided markets and so in
this kind of these models are kind of

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:10.860
this kind of these models are kind of
 

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.769
this kind of these models are kind of
going to formalize the idea you might

00:10:12.769 --> 00:10:12.779
going to formalize the idea you might
 

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:14.420
going to formalize the idea you might
have thought of what a newspaper does is

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:14.430
have thought of what a newspaper does is
 

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:17.660
have thought of what a newspaper does is
it creates news but a newspapers

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:17.670
it creates news but a newspapers
 

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:19.879
it creates news but a newspapers
business is the business of matching

00:10:19.879 --> 00:10:19.889
business is the business of matching
 

00:10:19.889 --> 00:10:23.780
business is the business of matching
users to advertisers they create content

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:23.790
users to advertisers they create content
 

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.030
users to advertisers they create content
to try to get people to come and read

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:26.040
to try to get people to come and read
 

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.949
to try to get people to come and read
them so they have a brand a user brand

00:10:27.949 --> 00:10:27.959
them so they have a brand a user brand
 

00:10:27.959 --> 00:10:29.810
them so they have a brand a user brand
awareness around news but their business

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:29.820
awareness around news but their business
 

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:33.740
awareness around news but their business
is matching users and advertisers and so

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:33.750
is matching users and advertisers and so
 

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:36.500
is matching users and advertisers and so
that this sort of the traditional media

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:36.510
that this sort of the traditional media
 

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:38.480
that this sort of the traditional media

encode has the idea that people are

going to single home that is go to only

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:43.230
going to single home that is go to only
 

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:47.090
going to single home that is go to only
one media outlet at the time so a user

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:47.100
one media outlet at the time so a user
 

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.400
one media outlet at the time so a user
might go to either the Boston Globe or

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:49.410
might go to either the Boston Globe or
 

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:51.410
might go to either the Boston Globe or
the New York Times but they're generally

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:51.420
the New York Times but they're generally
 

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:53.509
the New York Times but they're generally
not going to go to both at the same time

00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:53.519
not going to go to both at the same time
 

00:10:53.519 --> 00:10:57.500
not going to go to both at the same time
and then the the media outlet is is like

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:57.510
and then the the media outlet is is like
 

00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:59.509
and then the the media outlet is is like
the platform that's connecting the two

00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519
the platform that's connecting the two
 

00:10:59.519 --> 00:11:01.639
the platform that's connecting the two
sides of the market they're gonna bring

00:11:01.639 --> 00:11:01.649
sides of the market they're gonna bring
 

00:11:01.649 --> 00:11:04.699
sides of the market they're gonna bring
sell advertising to the users and

00:11:04.699 --> 00:11:04.709
sell advertising to the users and
 

00:11:04.709 --> 00:11:06.980
sell advertising to the users and
typically the advertisers if their

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:06.990
typically the advertisers if their
 

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:09.139
typically the advertisers if their
national advertiser would multi-home

00:11:09.139 --> 00:11:09.149
national advertiser would multi-home
 

00:11:09.149 --> 00:11:11.809
national advertiser would multi-home
that is they would advertise on both the

00:11:11.809 --> 00:11:11.819
that is they would advertise on both the
 

00:11:11.819 --> 00:11:14.059
that is they would advertise on both the
Boston Globe and the Washington Post

00:11:14.059 --> 00:11:14.069
Boston Globe and the Washington Post
 

00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:16.790
Boston Globe and the Washington Post
when they do that they're gonna reach a

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800
when they do that they're gonna reach a
 

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.790
when they do that they're gonna reach a
completely disjoint set of users and so

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:19.800
completely disjoint set of users and so
 

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.850
completely disjoint set of users and so
the the newspapers in some sense will

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:22.860
the the newspapers in some sense will
 

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:25.280
the the newspapers in some sense will
have the we call it a competitive

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:25.290
have the we call it a competitive
 

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:27.620
have the we call it a competitive
bottleneck they're going to have access

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:27.630
bottleneck they're going to have access
 

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:30.199
bottleneck they're going to have access
to a set of users and so once they

00:11:30.199 --> 00:11:30.209
to a set of users and so once they
 

00:11:30.209 --> 00:11:32.030
to a set of users and so once they
attract the users they're eight

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:32.040
attract the users they're eight
 

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.860
attract the users they're eight
basically able to auction them off to

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:33.870
basically able to auction them off to
 

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:36.410
basically able to auction them off to
the advertisers and essentially charge

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:36.420
the advertisers and essentially charge
 

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:38.900
the advertisers and essentially charge
monopoly prices so the theory of how

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:38.910
monopoly prices so the theory of how
 

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:42.079
monopoly prices so the theory of how
this works is that you compete hard you

00:11:42.079 --> 00:11:42.089
this works is that you compete hard you
 

00:11:42.089 --> 00:11:44.960
this works is that you compete hard you
hire lots of reporters to get users but

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:44.970
hire lots of reporters to get users but
 

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:46.850
hire lots of reporters to get users but
once you have your users you have a

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:46.860
once you have your users you have a
 

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.740
once you have your users you have a
monopoly over those users and the only

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:48.750
monopoly over those users and the only
 

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.600
monopoly over those users and the only
way to get them if you're trying to do

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:50.610
way to get them if you're trying to do
 

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:52.009
way to get them if you're trying to do
the kind of advertising that goes

00:11:52.009 --> 00:11:52.019
the kind of advertising that goes
 

00:11:52.019 --> 00:11:53.960
the kind of advertising that goes
through newspapers is to go through the

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:53.970
through newspapers is to go through the
 

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:55.519
through newspapers is to go through the
only way to get Boston users is to go

00:11:55.519 --> 00:11:55.529
only way to get Boston users is to go
 

00:11:55.529 --> 00:11:57.559
only way to get Boston users is to go
through the Boston Globe and so as a

00:11:57.559 --> 00:11:57.569
through the Boston Globe and so as a
 

00:11:57.569 --> 00:11:59.180
through the Boston Globe and so as a
result any trust policy around

result any trust policy around
 

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:01.689
result any trust policy around
newspapers you know as recently as like

00:12:01.689 --> 00:12:01.699
newspapers you know as recently as like
 

00:12:01.699 --> 00:12:03.400
newspapers you know as recently as like
twenty years ago was all about those

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:03.410
twenty years ago was all about those
 

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:05.949
twenty years ago was all about those
evil newspapers charging monopoly prices

00:12:05.949 --> 00:12:05.959
evil newspapers charging monopoly prices
 

00:12:05.959 --> 00:12:08.349
evil newspapers charging monopoly prices
to their local advertisers and there was

00:12:08.349 --> 00:12:08.359
to their local advertisers and there was
 

00:12:08.359 --> 00:12:10.210
to their local advertisers and there was
policy around preventing newspaper

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:10.220
policy around preventing newspaper
 

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:12.759
policy around preventing newspaper
mergers because which would allow the

00:12:12.759 --> 00:12:12.769
mergers because which would allow the
 

00:12:12.769 --> 00:12:14.710
mergers because which would allow the
newspapers to exercise their already

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:14.720
newspapers to exercise their already
 

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.409
newspapers to exercise their already
extensive market power over the local

00:12:17.409 --> 00:12:17.419
extensive market power over the local
 

00:12:17.419 --> 00:12:19.509
extensive market power over the local
advertisers so newspapers were a

00:12:19.509 --> 00:12:19.519
advertisers so newspapers were a
 

00:12:19.519 --> 00:12:21.489
advertisers so newspapers were a
monopoly problem and they were too

00:12:21.489 --> 00:12:21.499
monopoly problem and they were too
 

00:12:21.499 --> 00:12:26.019
monopoly problem and they were too
profitable very very recently so you

00:12:26.019 --> 00:12:26.029
profitable very very recently so you
 

00:12:26.029 --> 00:12:29.379
profitable very very recently so you
know that's the old world the new world

00:12:29.379 --> 00:12:29.389
know that's the old world the new world
 

00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:31.869
know that's the old world the new world
is going to try to get it the fact that

00:12:31.869 --> 00:12:31.879
is going to try to get it the fact that
 

00:12:31.879 --> 00:12:34.210
is going to try to get it the fact that
now people are because of technological

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:34.220
now people are because of technological
 

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.539
now people are because of technological
changes able to switch between outlets

00:12:37.539 --> 00:12:37.549
changes able to switch between outlets
 

00:12:37.549 --> 00:12:39.400
changes able to switch between outlets
so instead of going to one newspaper

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:39.410
so instead of going to one newspaper
 

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:42.519
so instead of going to one newspaper
outlet or another they're going to go to

00:12:42.519 --> 00:12:42.529
outlet or another they're going to go to
 

00:12:42.529 --> 00:12:45.669
outlet or another they're going to go to
multiple outlets but it's not it's also

00:12:45.669 --> 00:12:45.679
multiple outlets but it's not it's also
 

00:12:45.679 --> 00:12:47.199
multiple outlets but it's not it's also
not going to be the case that they're

00:12:47.199 --> 00:12:47.209
not going to be the case that they're
 

00:12:47.209 --> 00:12:48.939
not going to be the case that they're
definitely going to go to all outlets

00:12:48.939 --> 00:12:48.949
definitely going to go to all outlets
 

00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:50.079
definitely going to go to all outlets
they're going to be sort of

00:12:50.079 --> 00:12:50.089
they're going to be sort of
 

00:12:50.089 --> 00:12:52.509
they're going to be sort of
stochastically switching across outlets

00:12:52.509 --> 00:12:52.519
stochastically switching across outlets
 

00:12:52.519 --> 00:12:54.159
stochastically switching across outlets
so it's gonna be sort of an environment

00:12:54.159 --> 00:12:54.169
so it's gonna be sort of an environment
 

00:12:54.169 --> 00:12:57.699
so it's gonna be sort of an environment
of partial multihoming and that's

00:12:57.699 --> 00:12:57.709
of partial multihoming and that's
 

00:12:57.709 --> 00:13:00.280
of partial multihoming and that's
something that again hadn't been this

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:00.290
something that again hadn't been this
 

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:01.900
something that again hadn't been this
whole theory is relatively recent but

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:01.910
whole theory is relatively recent but
 

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:03.340
whole theory is relatively recent but
that those hits are partially

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:03.350
that those hits are partially
 

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:05.829
that those hits are partially
multihoming assumptions hadn't been very

00:13:05.829 --> 00:13:05.839
multihoming assumptions hadn't been very
 

00:13:05.839 --> 00:13:08.349
multihoming assumptions hadn't been very
well developed now our question is going

00:13:08.349 --> 00:13:08.359
well developed now our question is going
 

00:13:08.359 --> 00:13:10.749
well developed now our question is going
to be well once you move to this and or

00:13:10.749 --> 00:13:10.759
to be well once you move to this and or
 

00:13:10.759 --> 00:13:13.329
to be well once you move to this and or
world what's that going to do to what

00:13:13.329 --> 00:13:13.339
world what's that going to do to what
 

00:13:13.339 --> 00:13:15.460
world what's that going to do to what
the advertisers do because now the

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:15.470
the advertisers do because now the
 

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:17.710
the advertisers do because now the
advertisers might reach the same users

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:17.720
advertisers might reach the same users
 

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.289
advertisers might reach the same users
on multiple outlets so the in some sense

00:13:20.289 --> 00:13:20.299
on multiple outlets so the in some sense
 

00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:22.090
on multiple outlets so the in some sense
there's more than one way to reach a

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:22.100
there's more than one way to reach a
 

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:25.809
there's more than one way to reach a
given user and furthermore they're gonna

00:13:25.809 --> 00:13:25.819
given user and furthermore they're gonna
 

00:13:25.819 --> 00:13:27.609
given user and furthermore they're gonna
have to worry about hitting the same

00:13:27.609 --> 00:13:27.619
have to worry about hitting the same
 

00:13:27.619 --> 00:13:30.189
have to worry about hitting the same
users twice across multiple outlets so

00:13:30.189 --> 00:13:30.199
users twice across multiple outlets so
 

00:13:30.199 --> 00:13:31.989
users twice across multiple outlets so
the question is what will advertisers do

00:13:31.989 --> 00:13:31.999
the question is what will advertisers do
 

00:13:31.999 --> 00:13:33.819
the question is what will advertisers do
I don't want to assume that advertisers

00:13:33.819 --> 00:13:33.829
I don't want to assume that advertisers
 

00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:35.949
I don't want to assume that advertisers
go to multiple outlets it made sense for

00:13:35.949 --> 00:13:35.959
go to multiple outlets it made sense for
 

00:13:35.959 --> 00:13:37.900
go to multiple outlets it made sense for
them to go to multiple outlets if there

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:37.910
them to go to multiple outlets if there
 

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:39.729
them to go to multiple outlets if there
was a completely disjoint set of users

00:13:39.729 --> 00:13:39.739
was a completely disjoint set of users
 

00:13:39.739 --> 00:13:44.079
was a completely disjoint set of users
in New York and Washington but they may

00:13:44.079 --> 00:13:44.089
in New York and Washington but they may
 

00:13:44.089 --> 00:13:46.539
in New York and Washington but they may
not choose to do so anymore and then

00:13:46.539 --> 00:13:46.549
not choose to do so anymore and then
 

00:13:46.549 --> 00:13:49.210
not choose to do so anymore and then
what's gonna happen to the money so

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:49.220
what's gonna happen to the money so
 

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:50.739
what's gonna happen to the money so
thinking about this from an advertisers

00:13:50.739 --> 00:13:50.749
thinking about this from an advertisers
 

00:13:50.749 --> 00:13:52.779
thinking about this from an advertisers
perspective you can say okay there's a

00:13:52.779 --> 00:13:52.789
perspective you can say okay there's a
 

00:13:52.789 --> 00:13:54.519
perspective you can say okay there's a
user might come along they come to

00:13:54.519 --> 00:13:54.529
user might come along they come to
 

00:13:54.529 --> 00:13:56.769
user might come along they come to
outlet one and in the morning you can

00:13:56.769 --> 00:13:56.779
outlet one and in the morning you can
 

00:13:56.779 --> 00:14:00.099
outlet one and in the morning you can
show them a Starbucks ad now they might

00:14:00.099 --> 00:14:00.109
show them a Starbucks ad now they might
 

00:14:00.109 --> 00:14:01.509
show them a Starbucks ad now they might
come back to the same outlet in the

00:14:01.509 --> 00:14:01.519
come back to the same outlet in the
 

00:14:01.519 --> 00:14:02.979
come back to the same outlet in the
afternoon maybe they read a different

00:14:02.979 --> 00:14:02.989
afternoon maybe they read a different
 

00:14:02.989 --> 00:14:04.929
afternoon maybe they read a different
page and so they read a different app

00:14:04.929 --> 00:14:04.939
page and so they read a different app
 

00:14:04.939 --> 00:14:06.549
page and so they read a different app
they might see a different out a Zipcar

00:14:06.549 --> 00:14:06.559
they might see a different out a Zipcar
 

00:14:06.559 --> 00:14:09.249
they might see a different out a Zipcar
ad and we can assume that by showing

00:14:09.249 --> 00:14:09.259
ad and we can assume that by showing
 

00:14:09.259 --> 00:14:10.749
ad and we can assume that by showing
different ads on different pages or

00:14:10.749 --> 00:14:10.759
different ads on different pages or
 

00:14:10.759 --> 00:14:12.579
different ads on different pages or
using cookie tracking that was in an

00:14:12.579 --> 00:14:12.589
using cookie tracking that was in an
 

00:14:12.589 --> 00:14:14.319
using cookie tracking that was in an
outlet you can you can sort of make sure

00:14:14.319 --> 00:14:14.329
outlet you can you can sort of make sure
 

00:14:14.329 --> 00:14:16.379
outlet you can you can sort of make sure
that users don't see the same ad twice

00:14:16.379 --> 00:14:16.389
that users don't see the same ad twice
 

00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:19.299
that users don't see the same ad twice
but if but that user might not come to

00:14:19.299 --> 00:14:19.309
but if but that user might not come to
 

00:14:19.309 --> 00:14:22.329
but if but that user might not come to
two two outlet one in the afternoon they

00:14:22.329 --> 00:14:22.339
two two outlet one in the afternoon they
 

00:14:22.339 --> 00:14:24.220
two two outlet one in the afternoon they
might also go to outlet two and if

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:24.230
might also go to outlet two and if
 

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:25.629
might also go to outlet two and if
things work well maybe they'll see a

00:14:25.629 --> 00:14:25.639
things work well maybe they'll see a
 

00:14:25.639 --> 00:14:27.399
things work well maybe they'll see a
different advertisement on outlet two on

00:14:27.399 --> 00:14:27.409
different advertisement on outlet two on
 

00:14:27.409 --> 00:14:30.579
different advertisement on outlet two on
the other hand they might get unlucky

00:14:30.579 --> 00:14:30.589
the other hand they might get unlucky
 

00:14:30.589 --> 00:14:33.340
the other hand they might get unlucky
and see the same ad again which is

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:33.350
and see the same ad again which is
 

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:34.960
and see the same ad again which is
inefficient from the perspective of the

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:34.970
inefficient from the perspective of the
 

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:36.579
inefficient from the perspective of the
advertisers and so from the perspective

00:14:36.579 --> 00:14:36.589
advertisers and so from the perspective
 

00:14:36.589 --> 00:14:39.009
advertisers and so from the perspective
of the advertiser if they single home

00:14:39.009 --> 00:14:39.019
of the advertiser if they single home
 

00:14:39.019 --> 00:14:40.799
of the advertiser if they single home
that is that they go to only one outlet

00:14:40.799 --> 00:14:40.809
that is that they go to only one outlet
 

00:14:40.809 --> 00:14:44.259
that is that they go to only one outlet
they might miss some people but if they

00:14:44.259 --> 00:14:44.269
they might miss some people but if they
 

00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:45.939
they might miss some people but if they
multi home and go to two different

00:14:45.939 --> 00:14:45.949
multi home and go to two different
 

00:14:45.949 --> 00:14:48.069
multi home and go to two different
outlets they might hit the same person

00:14:48.069 --> 00:14:48.079
outlets they might hit the same person
 

00:14:48.079 --> 00:14:49.720
outlets they might hit the same person
twice and that's gonna create some

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:49.730
twice and that's gonna create some
 

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:53.350
twice and that's gonna create some
inefficiency so what we what we try to

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:53.360
inefficiency so what we what we try to
 

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.090
inefficiency so what we what we try to
explore the paper we build a theoretical

00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:55.100
explore the paper we build a theoretical
 

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.229
explore the paper we build a theoretical
model is well what are the implications

00:14:56.229 --> 00:14:56.239
model is well what are the implications
 

00:14:56.239 --> 00:14:59.169
model is well what are the implications
of all of this for how advertising

00:14:59.169 --> 00:14:59.179
of all of this for how advertising
 

00:14:59.179 --> 00:15:01.989
of all of this for how advertising
prices work and also for the incentives

00:15:01.989 --> 00:15:01.999
prices work and also for the incentives
 

00:15:01.999 --> 00:15:04.509
prices work and also for the incentives
of news outlets so how are the changes

00:15:04.509 --> 00:15:04.519
of news outlets so how are the changes
 

00:15:04.519 --> 00:15:07.389
of news outlets so how are the changes
in the world going to change the kinds

00:15:07.389 --> 00:15:07.399
in the world going to change the kinds
 

00:15:07.399 --> 00:15:10.299
in the world going to change the kinds
of strategies outlets will follow and so

00:15:10.299 --> 00:15:10.309
of strategies outlets will follow and so
 

00:15:10.309 --> 00:15:12.489
of strategies outlets will follow and so
what we basically show is that well if

00:15:12.489 --> 00:15:12.499
what we basically show is that well if
 

00:15:12.499 --> 00:15:14.349
what we basically show is that well if
you could perfectly track users across

00:15:14.349 --> 00:15:14.359
you could perfectly track users across
 

00:15:14.359 --> 00:15:16.960
you could perfectly track users across
outlets this competition the fact that

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:16.970
outlets this competition the fact that
 

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:18.609
outlets this competition the fact that
you can see the same user in multiple

00:15:18.609 --> 00:15:18.619
you can see the same user in multiple
 

00:15:18.619 --> 00:15:20.859
you can see the same user in multiple
outlets is going to lower advertising

00:15:20.859 --> 00:15:20.869
outlets is going to lower advertising
 

00:15:20.869 --> 00:15:22.359
outlets is going to lower advertising
prices it's gonna be a standard kind of

00:15:22.359 --> 00:15:22.369
prices it's gonna be a standard kind of
 

00:15:22.369 --> 00:15:25.090
prices it's gonna be a standard kind of
competition effect but if you add an

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:25.100
competition effect but if you add an
 

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.710
competition effect but if you add an
imperfect tracking the fact that you

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:26.720
imperfect tracking the fact that you
 

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.929
imperfect tracking the fact that you
might hit the same advertiser that see

00:15:28.929 --> 00:15:28.939
might hit the same advertiser that see
 

00:15:28.939 --> 00:15:30.759
might hit the same advertiser that see
the advertiser might hit the same user

00:15:30.759 --> 00:15:30.769
the advertiser might hit the same user
 

00:15:30.769 --> 00:15:33.279
the advertiser might hit the same user
twice we're going to get more complex

00:15:33.279 --> 00:15:33.289
twice we're going to get more complex
 

00:15:33.289 --> 00:15:36.369
twice we're going to get more complex
effects and in particular we're going to

00:15:36.369 --> 00:15:36.379
effects and in particular we're going to
 

00:15:36.379 --> 00:15:39.939
effects and in particular we're going to
see advertisers choosing not to

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:39.949
see advertisers choosing not to
 

00:15:39.949 --> 00:15:42.759
see advertisers choosing not to
advertise on all outlets so you get this

00:15:42.759 --> 00:15:42.769
advertise on all outlets so you get this
 

00:15:42.769 --> 00:15:45.129
advertise on all outlets so you get this
interesting equilibrium where high value

00:15:45.129 --> 00:15:45.139
interesting equilibrium where high value
 

00:15:45.139 --> 00:15:47.199
interesting equilibrium where high value
advertisers are going to advertise on

00:15:47.199 --> 00:15:47.209
advertisers are going to advertise on
 

00:15:47.209 --> 00:15:49.449
advertisers are going to advertise on
all outlets so at a certain price the

00:15:49.449 --> 00:15:49.459
all outlets so at a certain price the
 

00:15:49.459 --> 00:15:51.009
all outlets so at a certain price the
high value advertisers are going to say

00:15:51.009 --> 00:15:51.019
high value advertisers are going to say
 

00:15:51.019 --> 00:15:52.689
high value advertisers are going to say
I realize when I advertise on all

00:15:52.689 --> 00:15:52.699
I realize when I advertise on all
 

00:15:52.699 --> 00:15:53.169
I realize when I advertise on all
outlets

00:15:53.169 --> 00:15:53.179
outlets
 

00:15:53.179 --> 00:15:55.749
outlets
I'm not getting one user per ad I'm

00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:55.759
I'm not getting one user per ad I'm
 

00:15:55.759 --> 00:15:57.519
I'm not getting one user per ad I'm
getting less than one user per ad

00:15:57.519 --> 00:15:57.529
getting less than one user per ad
 

00:15:57.529 --> 00:15:59.169
getting less than one user per ad
because I'm gonna duplicate some people

00:15:59.169 --> 00:15:59.179
because I'm gonna duplicate some people
 

00:15:59.179 --> 00:16:01.359
because I'm gonna duplicate some people
so one ad is equal to a fraction of a

00:16:01.359 --> 00:16:01.369
so one ad is equal to a fraction of a
 

00:16:01.369 --> 00:16:04.509
so one ad is equal to a fraction of a
user but I like users so much that even

00:16:04.509 --> 00:16:04.519
user but I like users so much that even
 

00:16:04.519 --> 00:16:06.249
user but I like users so much that even
getting only a fraction of a user per ad

00:16:06.249 --> 00:16:06.259
getting only a fraction of a user per ad
 

00:16:06.259 --> 00:16:08.679
getting only a fraction of a user per ad
I'm willing to pay for it if I'm a a

00:16:08.679 --> 00:16:08.689
I'm willing to pay for it if I'm a a
 

00:16:08.689 --> 00:16:10.059
I'm willing to pay for it if I'm a a
lower value advertiser

00:16:10.059 --> 00:16:10.069
lower value advertiser
 

00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:12.519
lower value advertiser
I say oh gosh if I'm only getting a

00:16:12.519 --> 00:16:12.529
I say oh gosh if I'm only getting a
 

00:16:12.529 --> 00:16:14.769
I say oh gosh if I'm only getting a
fraction of user per ad that's too

00:16:14.769 --> 00:16:14.779
fraction of user per ad that's too
 

00:16:14.779 --> 00:16:17.409
fraction of user per ad that's too
expensive for me but if I focus on a

00:16:17.409 --> 00:16:17.419
expensive for me but if I focus on a
 

00:16:17.419 --> 00:16:19.449
expensive for me but if I focus on a
smaller number of outlets then I'm gonna

00:16:19.449 --> 00:16:19.459
smaller number of outlets then I'm gonna
 

00:16:19.459 --> 00:16:22.149
smaller number of outlets then I'm gonna
still get one user per ad and so then

00:16:22.149 --> 00:16:22.159
still get one user per ad and so then
 

00:16:22.159 --> 00:16:23.250
still get one user per ad and so then
that price

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:23.260
that price
 

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.350
that price
is is less than my value and I can

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:25.360
is is less than my value and I can
 

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.270
is is less than my value and I can
afford to advertise so I can afford to

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:27.280
afford to advertise so I can afford to
 

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.010
afford to advertise so I can afford to
advertise on a small number of outlets

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:29.020
advertise on a small number of outlets
 

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:30.480
advertise on a small number of outlets
when I make sure I don't have any waste

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:30.490
when I make sure I don't have any waste
 

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.550
when I make sure I don't have any waste
but if I tried to advertise on lots of

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:32.560
but if I tried to advertise on lots of
 

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.960
but if I tried to advertise on lots of
outlets there would be so much waste

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:33.970
outlets there would be so much waste
 

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:35.670
outlets there would be so much waste
that it wouldn't be worthwhile for me

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:35.680
that it wouldn't be worthwhile for me
 

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.460
that it wouldn't be worthwhile for me
and so we see this this mixed homing

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:38.470
and so we see this this mixed homing
 

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:41.730
and so we see this this mixed homing
which reduces the demand for advertising

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:41.740
which reduces the demand for advertising
 

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:45.300
which reduces the demand for advertising
which reduces advertising prices further

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:45.310
which reduces advertising prices further
 

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:48.720
which reduces advertising prices further
beyond the competitive effect and so

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:48.730
beyond the competitive effect and so
 

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:50.760
beyond the competitive effect and so
generally the more switching people do

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:50.770
generally the more switching people do
 

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:52.890
generally the more switching people do
the bigger this inefficiency is and the

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:52.900
the bigger this inefficiency is and the
 

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:57.060
the bigger this inefficiency is and the
more advertising demand is reduced so

00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:57.070
more advertising demand is reduced so
 

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:59.430
more advertising demand is reduced so
the high-level comparative static is all

00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440
the high-level comparative static is all
 

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:01.230
the high-level comparative static is all
this consumer switching the fact that

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:01.240
this consumer switching the fact that
 

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:03.450
this consumer switching the fact that
you've become disloyal is really going

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:03.460
you've become disloyal is really going
 

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.430
you've become disloyal is really going
to hurt advertising prices in

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:05.440
to hurt advertising prices in
 

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.890
to hurt advertising prices in
advertising markets and we can also

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:07.900
advertising markets and we can also
 

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:09.810
advertising markets and we can also
think about then what seconded what's

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:09.820
think about then what seconded what's
 

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:11.310
think about then what seconded what's
going to happen in the world of media

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:11.320
going to happen in the world of media
 

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:14.550
going to happen in the world of media
competition so things like blogs that

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:14.560
competition so things like blogs that
 

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:16.290
competition so things like blogs that
don't have a lot of advertising we can

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:16.300
don't have a lot of advertising we can
 

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:18.240
don't have a lot of advertising we can
think about what those do those take up

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:18.250
think about what those do those take up
 

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:20.340
think about what those do those take up
time but they don't add advertising

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:20.350
time but they don't add advertising
 

00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:22.710
time but they don't add advertising
capacity to the market and so they might

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:22.720
capacity to the market and so they might
 

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.870
capacity to the market and so they might
actually be bad if the blog steals your

00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:24.880
actually be bad if the blog steals your
 

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.300
actually be bad if the blog steals your
readers but good for advertising prices

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:27.310
readers but good for advertising prices
 

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:29.550
readers but good for advertising prices
because they take up time and without

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:29.560
because they take up time and without
 

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.830
because they take up time and without
taking up advertising space so they kind

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:31.840
taking up advertising space so they kind
 

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:35.700
taking up advertising space so they kind
of reduce the ply aggregators are going

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:35.710
of reduce the ply aggregators are going
 

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:37.440
of reduce the ply aggregators are going
to increase switching so things I'm

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:37.450
to increase switching so things I'm
 

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:38.730
to increase switching so things I'm
going to show you some facts about that

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:38.740
going to show you some facts about that
 

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:41.550
going to show you some facts about that
later so Google News or Huffington Post

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:41.560
later so Google News or Huffington Post
 

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.320
later so Google News or Huffington Post
might distribute you across a lot of

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:43.330
might distribute you across a lot of
 

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:44.670
might distribute you across a lot of
different outlets that increase

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:44.680
different outlets that increase
 

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:45.990
different outlets that increase
switching is going to be bad for

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.000
switching is going to be bad for
 

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.720
switching is going to be bad for
advertising prices and then we can think

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:48.730
advertising prices and then we can think
 

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:51.150
advertising prices and then we can think
about media strategy like if you put up

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:51.160
about media strategy like if you put up
 

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.550
about media strategy like if you put up
a paywall and you reduce your audience

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:53.560
a paywall and you reduce your audience
 

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.410
a paywall and you reduce your audience
okay if you put up the paywall and

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:55.420
okay if you put up the paywall and
 

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:58.410
okay if you put up the paywall and
reduce your audience then small

00:17:58.410 --> 00:17:58.420
reduce your audience then small
 

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:00.120
reduce your audience then small
advertisers if they have to pick just

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:00.130
advertisers if they have to pick just
 

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:01.860
advertisers if they have to pick just
one outlet they want to pick a big

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:01.870
one outlet they want to pick a big
 

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:03.480
one outlet they want to pick a big
outlet so they can get as a lot of

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:03.490
outlet so they can get as a lot of
 

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:04.860
outlet so they can get as a lot of
consumers they don't want to pick a

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:04.870
consumers they don't want to pick a
 

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:06.930
consumers they don't want to pick a
small outlet where they don't get as

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:06.940
small outlet where they don't get as
 

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:09.750
small outlet where they don't get as
many consumers so smaller outlets become

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:09.760
many consumers so smaller outlets become
 

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.660
many consumers so smaller outlets become
disadvantaged in the advertising

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:11.670
disadvantaged in the advertising
 

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:14.700
disadvantaged in the advertising
marketplace so by putting up a paywall

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:14.710
marketplace so by putting up a paywall
 

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:17.040
marketplace so by putting up a paywall
you first lose a bunch of your users and

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:17.050
you first lose a bunch of your users and
 

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:19.650
you first lose a bunch of your users and
then you second get lower price per user

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:19.660
then you second get lower price per user
 

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:21.690
then you second get lower price per user
because you're smaller the smaller you

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:21.700
because you're smaller the smaller you
 

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:24.180
because you're smaller the smaller you
are the lower your price per user on the

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:24.190
are the lower your price per user on the
 

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:26.130
are the lower your price per user on the
other hand something like facebook which

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:26.140
other hand something like facebook which
 

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:28.860
other hand something like facebook which
sees many many users maybe not all day

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:28.870
sees many many users maybe not all day
 

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:30.900
sees many many users maybe not all day
not exclusively but they see all users

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:30.910
not exclusively but they see all users
 

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:32.730
not exclusively but they see all users
once they have a really advantage

once they have a really advantage
because

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:33.070
because
 

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:35.009
because
in the advertising market because they

00:18:35.009 --> 00:18:35.019
in the advertising market because they
 

00:18:35.019 --> 00:18:36.870
in the advertising market because they
can sell to an advertiser the chance to

can sell to an advertiser the chance to
 

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:38.970
can sell to an advertiser the chance to
reach everybody once without any

don't sell Network information or they
sell basically reach the ability to

this question I ran a randomized

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:52.970
this question I ran a randomized
 

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:54.640
this question I ran a randomized
controlled experiment at being with a

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:54.650
controlled experiment at being with a
 

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:57.280
controlled experiment at being with a
couple million users and just before the

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:57.290
couple million users and just before the
 

00:20:57.290 --> 00:20:58.630
couple million users and just before the
users were about to see their search

00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:58.640
users were about to see their search
 

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.270
users were about to see their search
results we reversed the ranking of the

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280
results we reversed the ranking of the
 

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.160
results we reversed the ranking of the
results so we took what was supposed to

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:03.170
results so we took what was supposed to
 

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:04.930
results so we took what was supposed to
go on position one and ran was it in

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:04.940
go on position one and ran was it in
 

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:06.790
go on position one and ran was it in
position three took what was position

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:06.800
position three took what was position
 

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.620

three and put it in position one and
 

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:11.080
three and put it in position one and
then we saw how does that affect how

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:11.090
then we saw how does that affect how
 

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:14.650
then we saw how does that affect how

when the thing that's supposed to be on
top is in the first position it's

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:22.640
top is in the first position it's
 

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.540
top is in the first position it's
clicked 25% of the time but when you

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:25.550
clicked 25% of the time but when you
 

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:27.550
clicked 25% of the time but when you
take that thing in position one and move

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:27.560
take that thing in position one and move
 

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:31.150
take that thing in position one and move
it down to position three they lose 13.5

00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:31.160
it down to position three they lose 13.5
 

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.670

click-through rate is only 12 percent

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:35.330
click-through rate is only 12 percent
 

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:38.980
click-through rate is only 12 percent
instead of 25% so just moving the result

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:38.990
instead of 25% so just moving the result
 

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:41.530
instead of 25% so just moving the result
from position 1 to position 3 makes you

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:41.540
from position 1 to position 3 makes you
 

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:43.450
from position 1 to position 3 makes you
lose more than half of your clicks and

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:43.460
lose more than half of your clicks and
 

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:45.640
lose more than half of your clicks and
this also holds up if you look at what

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:45.650
this also holds up if you look at what
 

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:47.320
this also holds up if you look at what
you know dwell time or other measures

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:47.330
you know dwell time or other measures
 

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:49.930

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:08.050
thing from position 1 and put it into
position 3 it's clicked 12 percent of

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:08.060
position 3 it's clicked 12 percent of
 

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:09.940
position 3 it's clicked 12 percent of
the time and so that's showing the thing

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:09.950
the time and so that's showing the thing
 

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:11.920
the time and so that's showing the thing
that was in position 1 was better than

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:11.930
that was in position 1 was better than
 

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:13.900
that was in position 1 was better than
the thing that was in position 3 that is

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:13.910
the thing that was in position 3 that is
 

00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:15.760
the thing that was in position 3 that is
being our idiots they put better things

being our idiots they put better things
 

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:18.730
being our idiots they put better things
on top but if you take the good thing

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:18.740
on top but if you take the good thing
 

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:20.800
on top but if you take the good thing
and you move it down the page it's gonna

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:20.810
and you move it down the page it's gonna
 

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:22.660
and you move it down the page it's gonna
lose more than half of its place and of

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:39.820
the economics because what he's saying
 

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:42.330
the economics because what he's saying
is that a parasite well they don't do

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:42.340
is that a parasite well they don't do
 

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:44.549
is that a parasite well they don't do
any of their own work so the the

00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:44.559
any of their own work so the the
 

00:25:44.559 --> 00:25:46.110
any of their own work so the the
newspapers go out and do all the work

00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:46.120
newspapers go out and do all the work
 

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:47.820
newspapers go out and do all the work
and send the reporters to Syria and risk

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:47.830
and send the reporters to Syria and risk
 

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:50.340
and send the reporters to Syria and risk
their lives Google News doesn't do any

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:50.350
their lives Google News doesn't do any
 

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:52.950
their lives Google News doesn't do any
of that and there's and and but the

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:52.960
of that and there's and and but the
 

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.539
of that and there's and and but the
parasite kind of sucks the life out of

00:25:54.539 --> 00:25:54.549
parasite kind of sucks the life out of
 

00:25:54.549 --> 00:25:56.220
parasite kind of sucks the life out of
their hosts so people are going to

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:56.230
their hosts so people are going to
 

00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:57.870
their hosts so people are going to
Google News and not seeing any

00:25:57.870 --> 00:25:57.880
Google News and not seeing any
 

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.029

therefore they're stealing advertising

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:06.010
therefore they're stealing advertising
 

00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:08.159
therefore they're stealing advertising

because he expects to get a return on
 

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:29.399
because he expects to get a return on
his investment and if they read that

newspapers okay and of course both could

00:27:09.509 --> 00:27:09.519
newspapers okay and of course both could
 

00:27:09.519 --> 00:27:10.799
newspapers okay and of course both could
be going on and indeed that is what

be going on and indeed that is what
 

00:27:10.809 --> 00:27:12.690
be going on and indeed that is what
we're gonna find so if we think about

00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:12.700
we're gonna find so if we think about
 

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:14.430
we're gonna find so if we think about
how we could possibly tease this out

00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:14.440
how we could possibly tease this out
 

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:15.360
how we could possibly tease this out
though it's a little bit difficult

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:15.370
though it's a little bit difficult
 

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:17.250
though it's a little bit difficult
because after all so at the FTC

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:17.260

that's a little bit disingenuous because
 

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:31.640
that's a little bit disingenuous because
if you take out one newspaper that

if you take out one newspaper that
 

00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:33.770
if you take out one newspaper that
doesn't affect the Google News at all so

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:33.780
doesn't affect the Google News at all so
 

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:36.140
doesn't affect the Google News at all so
it doesn't affect user behavior but that

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:36.150
it doesn't affect user behavior but that
 

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:38.270
it doesn't affect user behavior but that
one newspaper is going to lose traffic

00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:38.280
one newspaper is going to lose traffic

one newspaper is going to lose traffic
and that traffic is going to go to

and that traffic is going to go to
 

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:42.620
and that traffic is going to go to
someone else so an experiment where one

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:42.630
someone else so an experiment where one

would like to see a world with Google

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.080
would like to see a world with Google
 

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:54.230
would like to see a world with Google
News in a world without Google News or

00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:56.150
News in a world without Google News or
maybe we would like to see a world with

maybe we would like to see a world with
 

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:58.370
maybe we would like to see a world with

a world with with Google News with some
big block of content gone so I'm going

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:02.940
big block of content gone so I'm going
 

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:04.730
big block of content gone so I'm going
to show two natural experiments that

00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:04.740
to show two natural experiments that
 

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:06.890
to show two natural experiments that
occurred where I can approximate those

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:06.900
occurred where I can approximate those
 

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:09.020
occurred where I can approximate those
kinds of counterfactuals and so

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:09.030
kinds of counterfactuals and so
 

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:11.810
kinds of counterfactuals and so
therefore measure the impact so the

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:11.820
therefore measure the impact so the
 

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:14.660
therefore measure the impact so the
first one is Spain and so just like at

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:14.670
first one is Spain and so just like at
 

00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:16.880
first one is Spain and so just like at
the FTC newspapers all over the world

these intermediaries are kind of

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:24.330
these intermediaries are kind of

to the post period they diverge and so

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:50.690
to the post period they diverge and so
 

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:52.480
to the post period they diverge and so
what happens is that the Google News

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:52.490

seventeen point five percent reduction
 

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:44.050
seventeen point five percent reduction
in articles so the pageviews include the

00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:44.060
in articles so the pageviews include the
 

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:45.850
in articles so the pageviews include the
landing pages the front pages as well as

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:45.860
landing pages the front pages as well as
 

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:47.320
landing pages the front pages as well as
the articles themselves and so I'm in a

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:47.330

News away from people they're gonna read
less news and so that supports the

00:34:57.820 --> 00:34:57.830
less news and so that supports the
 

00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:00.550
less news and so that supports the
Google News perspective that Google News

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:00.560
Google News perspective that Google News
 

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:05.680

is a complement to news outlets but then
so that's a the question was is it a

so that's a the question was is it a
 

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:10.450
so that's a the question was is it a
substitute or a complement and let me

00:35:10.450 --> 00:35:10.460
substitute or a complement and let me
 

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:11.890

for hotels you know in in some sense you
know for vacation renters maybe Airbnb

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:32.690

rental people who could list through
 

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:40.330
rental people who could list through
Airbnb so Airbnb is a complement for

00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:40.340
Airbnb so Airbnb is a complement for

Airbnb so Airbnb is a complement for
some things and it's a substitute for

00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:41.960
some things and it's a substitute for
 

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:43.780
some things and it's a substitute for
other things and so it's pretty common

00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:43.790
other things and so it's pretty common
 

00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:46.630
other things and so it's pretty common
that these new internet businesses

00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640
that these new internet businesses

look at Airbnb is not really a
substitute for a fancy hotel but it

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:00.680
substitute for a fancy hotel but it
 

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:02.290
substitute for a fancy hotel but it
might be a Santa substitute for a

00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:02.300
might be a Santa substitute for a
 

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:06.850
might be a Santa substitute for a
low-end hotel and so on so that way we

00:36:06.850 --> 00:36:06.860
low-end hotel and so on so that way we
 

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:08.740
low-end hotel and so on so that way we
can now I'm going to show you I'm not

00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:08.750
can now I'm going to show you I'm not
 

00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:10.570
can now I'm going to show you I'm not
going to do the all these full pictures

00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:10.580
going to do the all these full pictures
 

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:12.730
going to do the all these full pictures
anymore but I'm going to show you

00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:12.740
anymore but I'm going to show you
 

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:15.580
anymore but I'm going to show you
summary statistics which are called the

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:15.590
summary statistics which are called the
 

00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:16.960
summary statistics which are called the
different gifs estimates and so the

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:16.970
different gifs estimates and so the
 

00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:18.490
different gifs estimates and so the
different dip estimates you can think of

00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:18.500
different dip estimates you can think of
 

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:21.190
different dip estimates you can think of
is it's the difference it's this blue -

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:21.200
is it's the difference it's this blue -
 

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:25.360
is it's the difference it's this blue -
red - blue - red and so generally blue -

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:25.370
red - blue - red and so generally blue -
 

00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:28.810
red - blue - red and so generally blue -
red that difference is going to be very

00:36:28.810 --> 00:36:28.820
red that difference is going to be very
 

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:31.960
red that difference is going to be very
small in the pre period and it's going

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:31.970
small in the pre period and it's going
 

00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:33.310
small in the pre period and it's going
to be bigger in the post period it's

00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:33.320
to be bigger in the post period it's
 

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:34.930
to be bigger in the post period it's
that difference in difference is my

00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:34.940
that difference in difference is my
 

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:37.180
that difference in difference is my
estimate of the causal effect of Google

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:37.190
estimate of the causal effect of Google
 

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:40.720
estimate of the causal effect of Google
News okay so I can break things out

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:40.730
News okay so I can break things out
 

00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:43.590
News okay so I can break things out
first of all in terms of what kinds of

00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:43.600
first of all in terms of what kinds of
 

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:46.420
first of all in terms of what kinds of
content are affected in which way by

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:46.430
content are affected in which way by
 

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:48.910
content are affected in which way by
Google News going away and in particular

00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:48.920
Google News going away and in particular
 

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:52.030
Google News going away and in particular
have been breaking out articles landing

00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:52.040
have been breaking out articles landing
 

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.820
have been breaking out articles landing
pages landing pages exclude in Google

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:54.830
pages landing pages exclude in Google
 

00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:56.770
pages landing pages exclude in Google
News because Google News is itself like

00:36:56.770 --> 00:36:56.780
News because Google News is itself like
 

00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:59.890
News because Google News is itself like
a homepage and other content and so I'm

00:36:59.890 --> 00:36:59.900
a homepage and other content and so I'm
 

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:01.390
a homepage and other content and so I'm
going to see that when you take Google

00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:01.400
going to see that when you take Google
 

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:03.460
going to see that when you take Google
News away you're going to read less

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:03.470
News away you're going to read less
 

00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:06.130
News away you're going to read less
articles but you're actually going to go

00:37:06.130 --> 00:37:06.140
articles but you're actually going to go
 

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:08.800
articles but you're actually going to go
read more landing pages so the home

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:08.810
read more landing pages so the home
 

00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:11.260
read more landing pages so the home
pages of newspapers are going to benefit

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:11.270
pages of newspapers are going to benefit
 

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:13.600
pages of newspapers are going to benefit
from Google News going away but you're

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:13.610
from Google News going away but you're
 

00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:14.950
from Google News going away but you're
so like that from the New York Times

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:14.960
so like that from the New York Times
 

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.570
so like that from the New York Times
perspective you would see they're gonna

00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:16.580
perspective you would see they're gonna
 

00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:20.080
perspective you would see they're gonna
come to my home page more but I read my

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:20.090
come to my home page more but I read my
 

00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:22.960
come to my home page more but I read my
articles less okay so that's a sort of a

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:22.970
articles less okay so that's a sort of a
 

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:27.610
articles less okay so that's a sort of a
mixed effect and of course the home

00:37:27.610 --> 00:37:27.620
mixed effect and of course the home
 

00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:29.140
mixed effect and of course the home
pages are where they make a lot of their

00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:29.150
pages are where they make a lot of their
 

00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:30.580
pages are where they make a lot of their
advertising revenue that's where the

00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:30.590
advertising revenue that's where the
 

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:31.960
advertising revenue that's where the
most expensive ads aren't getting back

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:31.970
most expensive ads aren't getting back
 

00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:34.630
most expensive ads aren't getting back
to my previous point advertisers like to

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:34.640
to my previous point advertisers like to
 

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:36.910
to my previous point advertisers like to
get a lot of reach and so advertising on

00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:36.920
get a lot of reach and so advertising on
 

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:38.680
get a lot of reach and so advertising on
that home page is a way to get a lot of

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:38.690
that home page is a way to get a lot of
 

00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:41.640
that home page is a way to get a lot of
users and not hit too many of them twice

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:41.650
users and not hit too many of them twice
 

00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:44.710
users and not hit too many of them twice
so then we can say we'll look a little

00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:44.720
so then we can say we'll look a little
 

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.660
so then we can say we'll look a little
more closely at how people redistributed

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:46.670
more closely at how people redistributed
 

00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:48.160
more closely at how people redistributed
their reading if Google News goes away

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:48.170
their reading if Google News goes away
 

00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:50.470
their reading if Google News goes away
what do they do next and so they they

00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:50.480
what do they do next and so they they
 

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:54.040
what do they do next and so they they
substitute a lot to direct referrals and

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:54.050
substitute a lot to direct referrals and
 

00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:56.830
substitute a lot to direct referrals and
to search so they say searches a little

00:37:56.830 --> 00:37:56.840
to search so they say searches a little
 

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:58.950
to search so they say searches a little
bit of a substitute for Google News

00:37:58.950 --> 00:37:58.960
bit of a substitute for Google News
 

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:02.640
bit of a substitute for Google News
when you when you take it away

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:02.650
 

00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:04.710
and then I could also look at how long

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:04.720
and then I could also look at how long
 

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.510
and then I could also look at how long
people spend and all of our results are

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:06.520
people spend and all of our results are
 

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:07.710
people spend and all of our results are
kind of robust to looking at how long

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:07.720
kind of robust to looking at how long
 

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:09.180
kind of robust to looking at how long
people spend one thing you might worry

00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:09.190
people spend one thing you might worry
 

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:10.530
people spend one thing you might worry
about is when you go to Google News you

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:10.540
about is when you go to Google News you
 

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:11.940
about is when you go to Google News you
click on lots of things but you don't

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:11.950
click on lots of things but you don't
 

00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:13.920
click on lots of things but you don't
stay there very long and that's true to

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:13.930
stay there very long and that's true to
 

00:38:13.930 --> 00:38:15.930
stay there very long and that's true to
some extent but it's only a small effect

00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:15.940
some extent but it's only a small effect
 

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:18.210
some extent but it's only a small effect
so roughly the effects on pageviews are

00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:18.220
so roughly the effects on pageviews are
 

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:21.319
so roughly the effects on pageviews are
the same as the results on dwell time

00:38:21.319 --> 00:38:21.329
the same as the results on dwell time
 

00:38:21.329 --> 00:38:23.700
the same as the results on dwell time
but now let's start to get a little bit

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:23.710
but now let's start to get a little bit
 

00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:25.500
but now let's start to get a little bit
more interesting so I've said so far

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:25.510
more interesting so I've said so far
 

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:28.020
more interesting so I've said so far
Google News overall is a compliment for

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:28.030
Google News overall is a compliment for
 

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:30.329
Google News overall is a compliment for
the news industry but actually the

00:38:30.329 --> 00:38:30.339
the news industry but actually the
 

00:38:30.339 --> 00:38:32.420
the news industry but actually the
effects are gonna be quite heterogeneous

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:32.430
effects are gonna be quite heterogeneous
 

00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:35.400
effects are gonna be quite heterogeneous
so I can first of all break out the news

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:35.410
so I can first of all break out the news
 

00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:38.849
so I can first of all break out the news
outlets into top-5 outlets middle 15 and

00:38:38.849 --> 00:38:38.859
outlets into top-5 outlets middle 15 and
 

00:38:38.859 --> 00:38:41.819
outlets into top-5 outlets middle 15 and
less than 20 and so it's gonna turn out

00:38:41.819 --> 00:38:41.829
less than 20 and so it's gonna turn out
 

00:38:41.829 --> 00:38:45.000
less than 20 and so it's gonna turn out
is it when Google News goes away the top

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:45.010
is it when Google News goes away the top
 

00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:48.599
is it when Google News goes away the top
five outlets are helped so Google News

00:38:48.599 --> 00:38:48.609
five outlets are helped so Google News
 

00:38:48.609 --> 00:38:51.390
five outlets are helped so Google News
is a competitor for the top five if you

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:51.400
is a competitor for the top five if you
 

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:53.280
is a competitor for the top five if you
think about that intuitively you know

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:53.290
think about that intuitively you know
 

00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:55.230
think about that intuitively you know
that if you don't have Google News what

00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:55.240
that if you don't have Google News what
 

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:56.579
that if you don't have Google News what
are you gonna do you're gonna find

00:38:56.579 --> 00:38:56.589
are you gonna do you're gonna find
 

00:38:56.589 --> 00:38:58.829
are you gonna do you're gonna find
another top outlet and go there to get

00:38:58.829 --> 00:38:58.839
another top outlet and go there to get
 

00:38:58.839 --> 00:39:02.160
another top outlet and go there to get
your overall coverage now from that

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:02.170
your overall coverage now from that
 

00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:03.809
your overall coverage now from that
perspective if you think that also the

00:39:03.809 --> 00:39:03.819
perspective if you think that also the
 

00:39:03.819 --> 00:39:05.190
perspective if you think that also the
top five outlets are the ones sending

00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:05.200
top five outlets are the ones sending
 

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.230
top five outlets are the ones sending
reporters to Syria and doing a lot of

00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:07.240
reporters to Syria and doing a lot of
 

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:09.030
reporters to Syria and doing a lot of
the in-depth investigative journalism

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:09.040
the in-depth investigative journalism
 

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:11.160
the in-depth investigative journalism
then you start to feel a little bit less

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:11.170
then you start to feel a little bit less
 

00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:13.020
then you start to feel a little bit less
sanguine about this because you guys say

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:13.030
sanguine about this because you guys say
 

00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:15.359
sanguine about this because you guys say
gosh like Google News really is a

00:39:15.359 --> 00:39:15.369
gosh like Google News really is a
 

00:39:15.369 --> 00:39:18.180
gosh like Google News really is a
substitute for the New York Times and

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:18.190
substitute for the New York Times and
 

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:21.120
substitute for the New York Times and
therefore its existence might be funding

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:21.130
therefore its existence might be funding
 

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:24.020
therefore its existence might be funding
less reporters to Syria and less

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:24.030
less reporters to Syria and less
 

00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:27.180
less reporters to Syria and less
publication for the middle six to twenty

00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:27.190
publication for the middle six to twenty
 

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:30.059
publication for the middle six to twenty
it's kind of a wash overall and for the

00:39:30.059 --> 00:39:30.069
it's kind of a wash overall and for the
 

00:39:30.069 --> 00:39:32.160
it's kind of a wash overall and for the
book for the small outlets taking Google

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:32.170
book for the small outlets taking Google
 

00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:34.859
book for the small outlets taking Google
News away is bad so Google lose hope

would take more work and I've been

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:25.450
would take more work and I've been
 

00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:27.870
would take more work and I've been
working on this for years so I haven't

00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:27.880
working on this for years so I haven't
 

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:30.180
working on this for years so I haven't
dug into this yet that I could possibly

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:30.190
dug into this yet that I could possibly
 

00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:32.700
dug into this yet that I could possibly
try to do is really measure the

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:32.710
try to do is really measure the
 

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:34.950
try to do is really measure the
diversity of the news and figure out

00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:34.960
diversity of the news and figure out
 

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:37.740
diversity of the news and figure out
whether Google News increases or

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:37.750
whether Google News increases or
 

00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:40.590
whether Google News increases or
decreases diversity and I haven't done

00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:40.600
decreases diversity and I haven't done
 

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:42.630
decreases diversity and I haven't done
that yet but I am gonna show you a few

00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:42.640
that yet but I am gonna show you a few
 

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:44.340
that yet but I am gonna show you a few
results that are suggestive in that

00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:44.350
results that are suggestive in that
 

00:40:44.350 --> 00:40:47.010
results that are suggestive in that
direction so bottom line is that I can

00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:47.020
direction so bottom line is that I can
 

00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:49.110
direction so bottom line is that I can
say who's heard and who's helped but I

00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:49.120
say who's heard and who's helped but I
 

00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:50.550
say who's heard and who's helped but I
don't know what the implications are for

00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:50.560
don't know what the implications are for
 

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:53.730
don't know what the implications are for
welfare but generally we would like

00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:53.740
welfare but generally we would like
 

00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:56.970
welfare but generally we would like
people to be visiting the sites that do

00:40:56.970 --> 00:40:56.980
people to be visiting the sites that do
 

00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:59.340
people to be visiting the sites that do
the R&amp;D and so whichever R&amp;D is

00:40:59.340 --> 00:40:59.350
the R&amp;D and so whichever R&amp;D is
 

00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:01.410
the R&amp;D and so whichever R&amp;D is
non-duplicate 'iv and unique and

non-duplicate 'iv and unique and
 

00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:03.540
non-duplicate 'iv and unique and
valuable those are the people where we'd

00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:03.550
valuable those are the people where we'd
 

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:04.950
valuable those are the people where we'd
like the consumers to be reading their

funds that research week but we just

00:41:08.850 --> 00:41:08.860
funds that research week but we just
 

00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:11.610
funds that research week but we just
don't know where we really want more

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:11.620
don't know where we really want more
 

00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:15.960
don't know where we really want more
users to go okay so we also can look at

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:15.970
users to go okay so we also can look at
 

00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:18.090
users to go okay so we also can look at
switching so number of distinct outlets

00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:18.100
switching so number of distinct outlets
 

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:19.530
switching so number of distinct outlets
visit it and of course it's kind of

00:41:19.530 --> 00:41:19.540
visit it and of course it's kind of
 

00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:21.420
visit it and of course it's kind of
pretty intuitive but when you take

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:21.430
pretty intuitive but when you take
 

00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:23.070
pretty intuitive but when you take
Google News away you give pretty large

00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:23.080
Google News away you give pretty large
 

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:25.110
Google News away you give pretty large
reductions in the number of distinct

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:25.120
reductions in the number of distinct
 

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:27.180
reductions in the number of distinct
outlets visited across all outlets but

00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:27.190
outlets visited across all outlets but
 

00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:30.150
outlets visited across all outlets but
especially for small outlets so your

00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:30.160
especially for small outlets so your
 

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:32.040
especially for small outlets so your
Google news and things like Google News

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:32.050
Google news and things like Google News
 

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:34.170
Google news and things like Google News
make you much less loyal as a reader

00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:34.180
make you much less loyal as a reader
 

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:35.910
make you much less loyal as a reader
that can have implications for

00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:35.920
that can have implications for
 

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:37.680
that can have implications for
advertising revenue as well because if

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:37.690
advertising revenue as well because if
 

00:41:37.690 --> 00:41:39.390
advertising revenue as well because if
the newspaper doesn't know the reader

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:39.400
the newspaper doesn't know the reader
 

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:41.670
the newspaper doesn't know the reader
they can't serve them as relevant ads

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:41.680
they can't serve them as relevant ads
 

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:43.530
they can't serve them as relevant ads
and they also won't make as much money

00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:43.540
and they also won't make as much money
 

00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:47.130
and they also won't make as much money
on them so now let's let's think go a

00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:47.140
on them so now let's let's think go a
 

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:49.200
on them so now let's let's think go a
little bit deeper into like what is

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:49.210
little bit deeper into like what is
 

00:41:49.210 --> 00:41:51.270
little bit deeper into like what is
actually special about Google News and

00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:51.280
actually special about Google News and
 

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:54.600
actually special about Google News and
other online intermediaries so one thing

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:54.610
other online intermediaries so one thing
 

00:41:54.610 --> 00:41:56.370
other online intermediaries so one thing
is that it allows you to read more

00:41:56.370 --> 00:41:56.380
is that it allows you to read more
 

00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:58.500
is that it allows you to read more
deeply on preferred topics and do more

00:41:58.500 --> 00:41:58.510
deeply on preferred topics and do more
 

00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:01.950
deeply on preferred topics and do more
research as a user second and this is

00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:01.960
research as a user second and this is
 

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:03.720
research as a user second and this is
something newspapers get upset about and

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:03.730
something newspapers get upset about and
 

00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:06.270
something newspapers get upset about and
sort of got this unfair advantage from a

00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:06.280
sort of got this unfair advantage from a
 

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:07.980
sort of got this unfair advantage from a
newspapers perspective but a very

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:07.990
newspapers perspective but a very
 

00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:09.750
newspapers perspective but a very
convenient advantage from a user's

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:09.760
convenient advantage from a user's
 

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:12.090
convenient advantage from a user's
perspective of having the latest news if

00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:12.100
perspective of having the latest news if
 

00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:14.600

any news outlet has broken a story

00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:14.610
any news outlet has broken a story
 

00:42:14.610 --> 00:42:17.040
any news outlet has broken a story
Google News can have it five seconds

for when Google News goes away so we
 

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:55.440
for when Google News goes away so we
break out news according to how recent

look at my control users and I see does
 

00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:13.740
look at my control users and I see does
New York Times cover this topic more or

00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:13.750
New York Times cover this topic more or
 

00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:16.559
New York Times cover this topic more or
less than the news news industry as a

00:43:16.559 --> 00:43:16.569
less than the news news industry as a
 

00:43:16.569 --> 00:43:19.859
less than the news news industry as a
whole and so I for every user I find

00:43:19.859 --> 00:43:19.869
whole and so I for every user I find
 

00:43:19.869 --> 00:43:21.839
whole and so I for every user I find
their most popular outlets and then I

00:43:21.839 --> 00:43:21.849
their most popular outlets and then I
 

00:43:21.849 --> 00:43:24.630
their most popular outlets and then I
determine for that user whether a topic

00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:24.640
determine for that user whether a topic
 

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:26.190
determine for that user whether a topic
is under covered on their preferred

00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:26.200
is under covered on their preferred
 

00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:29.220
is under covered on their preferred
outlets or not and then what I do is I

00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:29.230
outlets or not and then what I do is I
 

00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:32.549
outlets or not and then what I do is I
try to estimate whether users whether

00:43:32.549 --> 00:43:32.559
try to estimate whether users whether
 

00:43:32.559 --> 00:43:35.309
try to estimate whether users whether
the Google News users are going to be

00:43:35.309 --> 00:43:35.319
the Google News users are going to be
 

00:43:35.319 --> 00:43:38.220
the Google News users are going to be
able to find a good substitute for their

00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:38.230
able to find a good substitute for their
 

00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:40.680
able to find a good substitute for their
news reading according to how scarce it

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:40.690
news reading according to how scarce it
 

00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:42.870
news reading according to how scarce it
is as well as according to how recent it

00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:42.880
is as well as according to how recent it
 

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:45.180
is as well as according to how recent it
is so what I do is I make a prediction

00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:45.190
is so what I do is I make a prediction
 

00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:47.359
is so what I do is I make a prediction
and the prediction are the long bars

00:43:47.359 --> 00:43:47.369
and the prediction are the long bars
 

00:43:47.369 --> 00:43:51.030
and the prediction are the long bars
about how much the goat the Google News

00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:51.040
about how much the goat the Google News
 

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:53.640
about how much the goat the Google News
users news readings should be reduced if

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:53.650
users news readings should be reduced if
 

00:43:53.650 --> 00:43:56.670
users news readings should be reduced if
I just zeroed out the Google news from

00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:56.680
I just zeroed out the Google news from
 

00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:58.650
I just zeroed out the Google news from
their browsing and didn't replace it

00:43:58.650 --> 00:43:58.660
their browsing and didn't replace it
 

00:43:58.660 --> 00:43:59.940
their browsing and didn't replace it
with anything so this is like the

00:43:59.940 --> 00:43:59.950
with anything so this is like the
 

00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:01.859
with anything so this is like the
counterfactual if Google News goes away

00:44:01.859 --> 00:44:01.869
counterfactual if Google News goes away
 

00:44:01.869 --> 00:44:04.380
counterfactual if Google News goes away
and they don't substitute so for example

00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:04.390
and they don't substitute so for example
 

00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:06.510
and they don't substitute so for example
my prediction here is that for very

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:06.520
my prediction here is that for very
 

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:09.120
my prediction here is that for very
recent very scarce news you would see

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:09.130
recent very scarce news you would see
 

00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:11.370
recent very scarce news you would see
about if you just zeroed out Google News

00:44:11.370 --> 00:44:11.380
about if you just zeroed out Google News
 

00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:13.079
about if you just zeroed out Google News
they would see like a seventeen seventy

00:44:13.079 --> 00:44:13.089
they would see like a seventeen seventy
 

00:44:13.089 --> 00:44:15.329
they would see like a seventeen seventy
seven percent reduction in reading that

00:44:15.329 --> 00:44:15.339
seven percent reduction in reading that
 

00:44:15.339 --> 00:44:17.010
seven percent reduction in reading that
kind of news if you took Google News

00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:17.020
kind of news if you took Google News
 

00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:20.250
kind of news if you took Google News
away then the dark bar is the actual and

00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:20.260
away then the dark bar is the actual and
 

00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:22.530
away then the dark bar is the actual and
so in this case the the counterfactual

00:44:22.530 --> 00:44:22.540
so in this case the the counterfactual
 

00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:25.140
so in this case the the counterfactual
equals the actual that is if you took

00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:25.150
equals the actual that is if you took
 

00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:26.010
equals the actual that is if you took
Google News

00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:26.020
Google News
 

00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:29.400
Google News
you would lose 77% and and in fact they

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:29.410
you would lose 77% and and in fact they
 

00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:31.950
you would lose 77% and and in fact they
do lose 77% they cannot find a good

00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:31.960
do lose 77% they cannot find a good
 

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:33.660
do lose 77% they cannot find a good
substitute for that so they just lose

00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:33.670
substitute for that so they just lose
 

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:36.960
substitute for that so they just lose
very recent news that is not well

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:36.970
very recent news that is not well
 

00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:40.050
very recent news that is not well
covered on their preferred um news

00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:40.060
covered on their preferred um news
 

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:42.450
covered on their preferred um news
outlets on the other hand way up here

00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:42.460
outlets on the other hand way up here
 

00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:46.230
outlets on the other hand way up here
for non scarce news that is that has

00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:46.240
for non scarce news that is that has
 

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:48.240
for non scarce news that is that has
been broken for more than half a day I

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:48.250
been broken for more than half a day I
 

00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:50.010
been broken for more than half a day I
would predict if you just zeroed out

00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:50.020
would predict if you just zeroed out
 

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:51.810
would predict if you just zeroed out
Google News you would get more than a 20

00:44:51.810 --> 00:44:51.820
Google News you would get more than a 20
 

00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:53.760
Google News you would get more than a 20
percent reduction in that news reading

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:53.770
percent reduction in that news reading
 

00:44:53.770 --> 00:44:56.160
percent reduction in that news reading
but actually they only get like a 7

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:56.170
but actually they only get like a 7
 

00:44:56.170 --> 00:44:58.050
but actually they only get like a 7
percent reduction which is basically

00:44:58.050 --> 00:44:58.060
percent reduction which is basically
 

00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:00.359
percent reduction which is basically
saying that they were able to find good

00:45:00.359 --> 00:45:00.369
saying that they were able to find good
 

00:45:00.369 --> 00:45:02.370
saying that they were able to find good
substitutes for stuff that's well

00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:02.380
substitutes for stuff that's well
 

00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:04.109
substitutes for stuff that's well
covered on their own outlets and that's

00:45:04.109 --> 00:45:04.119
covered on their own outlets and that's
 

00:45:04.119 --> 00:45:05.220
covered on their own outlets and that's
not very recent

00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:05.230
not very recent
 

00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:08.580
not very recent
so essentially what Google we might try

00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:08.590
so essentially what Google we might try
 

00:45:08.590 --> 00:45:10.830
so essentially what Google we might try
to account for what kind of news is

00:45:10.830 --> 00:45:10.840
to account for what kind of news is
 

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:13.290
to account for what kind of news is
going away your Google News users are

00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:13.300
going away your Google News users are
 

00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:16.350
going away your Google News users are
losing their access to to news that was

00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:16.360
losing their access to to news that was
 

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:18.150
losing their access to to news that was
covered on a wider range of outlets and

00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:18.160
covered on a wider range of outlets and
 

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:20.280
covered on a wider range of outlets and
they usually read and to news that was

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:20.290
they usually read and to news that was
 

00:45:20.290 --> 00:45:22.260
they usually read and to news that was
recently breaking and so I think what I

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:22.270
recently breaking and so I think what I
 

00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:24.330
recently breaking and so I think what I
think about the strategy of the news

00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:24.340
think about the strategy of the news
 

00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:26.609
think about the strategy of the news
industry therefore this is kind of what

00:45:26.609 --> 00:45:26.619
industry therefore this is kind of what
 

00:45:26.619 --> 00:45:28.230
industry therefore this is kind of what
you're competing with if you're trying

00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:28.240
you're competing with if you're trying
 

00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:30.990
you're competing with if you're trying
to keep from losing your users what your

00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:31.000
to keep from losing your users what your
 

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.520
to keep from losing your users what your
users are getting elsewhere that they're

not getting on the New York Times is

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:34.210
not getting on the New York Times is
 

00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:36.450
not getting on the New York Times is
this kind of recent news and also in

00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:36.460
this kind of recent news and also in
 

00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:39.000
this kind of recent news and also in
depth coverage which leads me to the

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:39.010
depth coverage which leads me to the
 

00:45:39.010 --> 00:45:40.830
depth coverage which leads me to the
same conclusion I had for my advertising

00:45:40.830 --> 00:45:40.840
same conclusion I had for my advertising
 

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:42.090
same conclusion I had for my advertising
thing which is I would expect to see

00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:42.100
thing which is I would expect to see
 

00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:45.330
thing which is I would expect to see
more mergers more joint ventures more

not so good for media diversity so just

00:45:59.490 --> 00:45:59.500
not so good for media diversity so just

in my last couple minutes I had we did

00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:01.630
in my last couple minutes I had we did
 

00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:04.470
in my last couple minutes I had we did
another study in France um where we got

00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:04.480
another study in France um where we got
 

00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:06.390
another study in France um where we got
similar results let me talk very briefly

00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:06.400
similar results let me talk very briefly
 

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:10.260
similar results let me talk very briefly
about the impact of Facebook on news

00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:10.270
about the impact of Facebook on news
 

00:46:10.270 --> 00:46:12.390
about the impact of Facebook on news
consumption and so we have a similar

00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:12.400
consumption and so we have a similar
 

00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:15.210
consumption and so we have a similar
kind of data set but in what we do for

00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:15.220
kind of data set but in what we do for
 

00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:17.400
kind of data set but in what we do for
this study is that we put the news

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:17.410
this study is that we put the news
 

00:46:17.410 --> 00:46:20.070
this study is that we put the news
articles into topics things like Boston

00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:20.080
articles into topics things like Boston
 

00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:25.170
articles into topics things like Boston
Marathon bombing 2013 war tornado and we

00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:25.180
Marathon bombing 2013 war tornado and we
 

00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:27.630

using text mining techniques and then

00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:27.640
using text mining techniques and then
 

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:30.000
using text mining techniques and then
once we've got them into topics were

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:30.010
once we've got them into topics were
 

00:46:30.010 --> 00:46:32.490
once we've got them into topics were
then able to use crowdsourcing to

00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:32.500
then able to use crowdsourcing to
 

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:34.800
then able to use crowdsourcing to
understand what are the characteristics

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:34.810
understand what are the characteristics
 

00:46:34.810 --> 00:46:37.200
understand what are the characteristics
of different topics as well as what are

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:37.210
of different topics as well as what are
 

00:46:37.210 --> 00:46:37.440
of different topics as well as what are
the

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:37.450
the
 

00:46:37.450 --> 00:46:39.240
the
characteristics of different articles

characteristics of different articles
 

00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:42.990
characteristics of different articles
and so we use a we use a grass technique

00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:43.000
and so we use a we use a grass technique
 

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.180
and so we use a we use a grass technique

wikipedia and so just to give like a few

00:46:48.359 --> 00:46:48.369
wikipedia and so just to give like a few
 

00:46:48.369 --> 00:46:50.460

of the findings that we have first of

00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:50.470
of the findings that we have first of
 

00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:52.800
of the findings that we have first of
all you might have thought that not what

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:52.810
all you might have thought that not what
 

00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:54.390
all you might have thought that not what
i'm going to be comparing is what you

00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:54.400
i'm going to be comparing is what you
 

00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:58.290
i'm going to be comparing is what you
read when you go directly to a news

00:46:58.290 --> 00:46:58.300
read when you go directly to a news
 

00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:00.780
read when you go directly to a news
outlet versus what do you read when you

00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:00.790
outlet versus what do you read when you
 

00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:03.240
outlet versus what do you read when you
get go from facebook or twitter so the

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:03.250
get go from facebook or twitter so the
 

00:47:03.250 --> 00:47:05.040
get go from facebook or twitter so the
blue is what you do with social media

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:05.050
blue is what you do with social media
 

00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:07.410
blue is what you do with social media
the red is what you do when you go

00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:07.420
the red is what you do when you go
 

00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:10.109
the red is what you do when you go
directly and the green is counted

00:47:10.109 --> 00:47:10.119
directly and the green is counted
 

00:47:10.119 --> 00:47:12.750
directly and the green is counted
adjusting for user mix so it's trying to

00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:12.760
adjusting for user mix so it's trying to
 

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:14.520
adjusting for user mix so it's trying to
adjust for the fact that the you

00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:14.530
adjust for the fact that the you
 

00:47:14.530 --> 00:47:16.680
adjust for the fact that the you
different users use social media and

00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:16.690
different users use social media and
 

00:47:16.690 --> 00:47:18.810
different users use social media and
direct navigation so if the green and

00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:18.820
direct navigation so if the green and
 

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:20.400
direct navigation so if the green and
the blue are close together that

00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:20.410
the blue are close together that
 

00:47:20.410 --> 00:47:22.140
the blue are close together that
basically says that adjusting for user

00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:22.150
basically says that adjusting for user
 

00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:23.670
basically says that adjusting for user
mix there's not much difference with

00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:23.680
mix there's not much difference with
 

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:25.950
mix there's not much difference with
social media and direct navigation so we

00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:25.960
social media and direct navigation so we
 

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:27.810
social media and direct navigation so we
find at the very high level there

00:47:27.810 --> 00:47:27.820
find at the very high level there
 

00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:29.460
find at the very high level there
actually aren't a lot of differences

00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:29.470
actually aren't a lot of differences
 

00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:31.380
actually aren't a lot of differences
between the high level topics crime

00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:31.390
between the high level topics crime
 

00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:33.450
between the high level topics crime
celebrity business between social media

00:47:33.450 --> 00:47:33.460
celebrity business between social media
 

00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:36.750
celebrity business between social media
and direct navigation but we do find a

00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:36.760
and direct navigation but we do find a
 

00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:40.260
and direct navigation but we do find a
lot more within topic variation for

00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:40.270
lot more within topic variation for
 

00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:42.660
lot more within topic variation for
example we find that on social media

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:42.670
example we find that on social media
 

00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:43.980
example we find that on social media
people read stories that are written

00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:43.990
people read stories that are written
 

00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:45.630
people read stories that are written
differently stories that have an

differently stories that have an
 

00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:48.540
differently stories that have an
individual perspective stories that

individual perspective stories that
 

00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:51.440
individual perspective stories that
assume background knowledge we find a

00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:51.450
assume background knowledge we find a
 

00:47:51.450 --> 00:47:54.530
assume background knowledge we find a
stories that do in-depth analysis

00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:54.540
stories that do in-depth analysis
 

00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:58.290
stories that do in-depth analysis
controversial opinion politically

00:47:58.290 --> 00:47:58.300
controversial opinion politically
 

00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:00.390
controversial opinion politically
controversial as well as those with a

00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:00.400
controversial as well as those with a
 

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:02.670
controversial as well as those with a
caring supporting attitude are all more

00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:02.680
caring supporting attitude are all more
 

00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:08.520
caring supporting attitude are all more
prevalent on social media we we find as

00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:08.530
prevalent on social media we we find as
 

00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:10.410
prevalent on social media we we find as
well that there's more specific

00:48:10.410 --> 00:48:10.420
well that there's more specific
 

00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:11.730
well that there's more specific
targeting like there's more articles

00:48:11.730 --> 00:48:11.740
targeting like there's more articles
 

00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:13.530
targeting like there's more articles
shared targeted towards women or

00:48:13.530 --> 00:48:13.540
shared targeted towards women or
 

00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:15.630
shared targeted towards women or
families on social media then there is

00:48:15.630 --> 00:48:15.640
families on social media then there is
 

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:18.000
families on social media then there is
when you go from direct navigation and

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:18.010
when you go from direct navigation and
 

00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:20.400
when you go from direct navigation and
we find some differences in positivity

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:20.410
we find some differences in positivity
 

00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:23.640
we find some differences in positivity
and compassion as well between direct

00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:23.650
and compassion as well between direct
 

00:48:23.650 --> 00:48:26.520
and compassion as well between direct
navigation and social media so what we

00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:26.530
navigation and social media so what we
 

00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:28.589
navigation and social media so what we
see is that what brought the high level

00:48:28.589 --> 00:48:28.599
see is that what brought the high level
 

00:48:28.599 --> 00:48:30.630
see is that what brought the high level
topics aren't different but the way the

00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:30.640
topics aren't different but the way the
 

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:32.370
topics aren't different but the way the
articles are written and how they're

00:48:32.370 --> 00:48:32.380
articles are written and how they're
 

00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:35.370
articles are written and how they're
told and researched is different so the

00:48:35.370 --> 00:48:35.380
told and researched is different so the
 

00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:37.170
told and researched is different so the
final thing that we look at is political

00:48:37.170 --> 00:48:37.180
final thing that we look at is political
 

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:39.120
final thing that we look at is political
bias and and these numbers actually

00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:39.130
bias and and these numbers actually
 

00:48:39.130 --> 00:48:41.309
bias and and these numbers actually
we've done a pilot study and we're

00:48:41.309 --> 00:48:41.319
we've done a pilot study and we're
 

00:48:41.319 --> 00:48:42.870
we've done a pilot study and we're
trying to do a longer study because

00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:42.880
trying to do a longer study because
 

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:44.700
trying to do a longer study because
these numbers are probably the most

00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:44.710
these numbers are probably the most
 

00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:45.730
these numbers are probably the most
sensitive

00:48:45.730 --> 00:48:45.740
sensitive
 

00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:48.940
sensitive
the sample size we first of all look at

00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:48.950
the sample size we first of all look at
 

00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:51.730
the sample size we first of all look at
and find that when we look out at topics

00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:51.740
and find that when we look out at topics
 

00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:53.980
and find that when we look out at topics
some topics tend very conservative and

00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:53.990
some topics tend very conservative and
 

00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:55.870
some topics tend very conservative and
some tend very liberal so if you're

00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:55.880
some tend very liberal so if you're
 

00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:57.220
some tend very liberal so if you're
gonna read an article about school

00:48:57.220 --> 00:48:57.230
gonna read an article about school
 

00:48:57.230 --> 00:48:59.680
gonna read an article about school
shootings it tends to skew very liberal

00:48:59.680 --> 00:48:59.690
shootings it tends to skew very liberal
 

00:48:59.690 --> 00:49:01.240
shootings it tends to skew very liberal
if you're gonna read an article about

00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:01.250
if you're gonna read an article about
 

00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:03.370
if you're gonna read an article about
Benghazi they tend to skew very

00:49:03.370 --> 00:49:03.380
Benghazi they tend to skew very
 

00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:05.830
Benghazi they tend to skew very
conservative and in fact one of the big

00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:05.840
conservative and in fact one of the big
 

00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:07.300
conservative and in fact one of the big
determinants if you want to try to

00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:07.310
determinants if you want to try to
 

00:49:07.310 --> 00:49:09.520
determinants if you want to try to
predict the political bias of an article

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:09.530
predict the political bias of an article
 

00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:12.070
predict the political bias of an article
the topic can be more important than the

00:49:12.070 --> 00:49:12.080
the topic can be more important than the
 

00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:13.870
the topic can be more important than the
news outlet and predicting those things

00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:13.880
news outlet and predicting those things
 

00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:15.340
news outlet and predicting those things
so the big difference between the Fox

00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:15.350
so the big difference between the Fox
 

00:49:15.350 --> 00:49:17.320
so the big difference between the Fox
and New York Times is that Fox covers

00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:17.330
and New York Times is that Fox covers
 

00:49:17.330 --> 00:49:18.880
and New York Times is that Fox covers
Benghazi if there's ever a story about

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:18.890
Benghazi if there's ever a story about
 

00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:20.320
Benghazi if there's ever a story about
Benghazi they're going to cover it if

00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:20.330
Benghazi they're going to cover it if
 

00:49:20.330 --> 00:49:21.430
Benghazi they're going to cover it if
you ask they're digital people they'll

00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:21.440
you ask they're digital people they'll
 

00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:22.780
you ask they're digital people they'll
say that's intentional that's their

00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:22.790
say that's intentional that's their
 

00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:24.640
say that's intentional that's their
strategy that's what one of the big

00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:24.650
strategy that's what one of the big
 

00:49:24.650 --> 00:49:26.109
strategy that's what one of the big
things that's different between news

00:49:26.109 --> 00:49:26.119
things that's different between news
 

00:49:26.119 --> 00:49:28.750
things that's different between news
outlets then what we do we take

00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:28.760
outlets then what we do we take
 

00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:30.520
outlets then what we do we take
advantage of our of our topic

00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:30.530
advantage of our of our topic
 

00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:32.590
advantage of our of our topic
classifications to crowdsource the

00:49:32.590 --> 00:49:32.600
classifications to crowdsource the
 

00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:34.810
classifications to crowdsource the
political bias of articles only for

00:49:34.810 --> 00:49:34.820
political bias of articles only for
 

00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:36.280
political bias of articles only for
articles that are potentially

00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:36.290
articles that are potentially
 

00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:38.440
articles that are potentially
politically biased so we throw out the

00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:38.450
politically biased so we throw out the
 

00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:40.210
politically biased so we throw out the
articles about tornadoes and about

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:40.220
articles about tornadoes and about
 

00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:42.910
articles about tornadoes and about
sports events and only study articles

00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:42.920
sports events and only study articles
 

00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:44.440
sports events and only study articles
that are that are potentially

00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:44.450
that are that are potentially
 

00:49:44.450 --> 00:49:47.200
that are that are potentially
politically biased and then we look at

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:47.210
politically biased and then we look at
 

00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:49.090
politically biased and then we look at
whether people read more biased stuff

00:49:49.090 --> 00:49:49.100
whether people read more biased stuff
 

00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:50.650
whether people read more biased stuff
off of social media and again these

00:49:50.650 --> 00:49:50.660
off of social media and again these
 

00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:52.660
off of social media and again these
exact numbers are probably a little bit

00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:52.670
exact numbers are probably a little bit
 

00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:55.330
exact numbers are probably a little bit
skewed because of my small simple but we

00:49:55.330 --> 00:49:55.340
skewed because of my small simple but we
 

00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:57.970
skewed because of my small simple but we
see that people read less neutral news

00:49:57.970 --> 00:49:57.980
see that people read less neutral news
 

00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:03.310
see that people read less neutral news
and more on on social media and more and

00:50:03.310 --> 00:50:03.320
and more on on social media and more and
 

00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:05.170
and more on on social media and more and
more neutral news on direct navigation

00:50:05.170 --> 00:50:05.180
more neutral news on direct navigation
 

00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:08.200
more neutral news on direct navigation
then what we do is we look at people who

00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:08.210
then what we do is we look at people who
 

00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:10.240
then what we do is we look at people who
we have we only look at a subset of

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:10.250
we have we only look at a subset of
 

00:50:10.250 --> 00:50:11.830
we have we only look at a subset of
people who have read conservative

00:50:11.830 --> 00:50:11.840
people who have read conservative
 

00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:13.780
people who have read conservative
articles in the previous week and for

00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:13.790
articles in the previous week and for
 

00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:15.820
articles in the previous week and for
people that read a conservative article

00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:15.830
people that read a conservative article
 

00:50:15.830 --> 00:50:17.950

00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:15.810
bottle it out and so if they have
 

00:54:15.810 --> 00:54:17.840
bottle it out and so if they have
opposing interests both sides get aired

00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:17.850
opposing interests both sides get aired
 

00:54:17.850 --> 00:54:19.940
opposing interests both sides get aired
and the competitive process lets the

00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:19.950
and the competitive process lets the
 

00:54:19.950 --> 00:54:21.890
and the competitive process lets the
information come out I think the problem

00:54:21.890 --> 00:54:21.900
information come out I think the problem
 

00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:23.480
information come out I think the problem
is that it may be it's something like

00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:23.490
is that it may be it's something like
 

00:54:23.490 --> 00:54:24.890
is that it may be it's something like
you say where most of the companies

00:54:24.890 --> 00:54:24.900
you say where most of the companies
 

00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:26.690
you say where most of the companies
interests lie in one direction and

00:54:26.690 --> 00:54:26.700
interests lie in one direction and
 

00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:29.450
interests lie in one direction and
they're able to invest in research and

00:54:29.450 --> 00:54:29.460
they're able to invest in research and
 

00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:31.550
they're able to invest in research and
persuasive information and maybe they

00:54:31.550 --> 00:54:31.560
persuasive information and maybe they
 

00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:33.260
persuasive information and maybe they
believe it's very maybe they believe

00:54:33.260 --> 00:54:33.270
believe it's very maybe they believe
 

00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:35.180
believe it's very maybe they believe
what they're they're saying and maybe

00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:35.190
what they're they're saying and maybe
 

00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:37.760
what they're they're saying and maybe
their research supports it but it's just

00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:37.770
their research supports it but it's just
 

00:54:37.770 --> 00:54:40.390
their research supports it but it's just
one perspective and then there's nobody

00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:40.400
one perspective and then there's nobody
 

00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:42.950
one perspective and then there's nobody
investing the corresponding offsetting

00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:42.960
investing the corresponding offsetting
 

00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:45.350
investing the corresponding offsetting
R&amp;D on the other side and absolutely I

00:54:45.350 --> 00:54:45.360
R&amp;D on the other side and absolutely I
 

00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:46.730
R&amp;D on the other side and absolutely I
think those are things that we should be

00:54:46.730 --> 00:54:46.740
think those are things that we should be
 

00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:48.890
think those are things that we should be
very worried about um I think in this

00:54:48.890 --> 00:54:48.900
very worried about um I think in this
 

00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:49.880
very worried about um I think in this
country in the current political

00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:49.890
country in the current political
 

00:54:49.890 --> 00:54:51.620
country in the current political
environment it's highly unlikely we're

00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:51.630
environment it's highly unlikely we're
 

00:54:51.630 --> 00:54:53.150
environment it's highly unlikely we're
going to do more public funding of

00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:53.160
going to do more public funding of
 

00:54:53.160 --> 00:55:05.540
going to do more public funding of
journalism so it's a problem on a debate

00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:05.550
journalism so it's a problem on a debate
 

00:55:05.550 --> 00:55:07.550
journalism so it's a problem on a debate
where the question was to search engines

00:55:07.550 --> 00:55:07.560
where the question was to search engines
 

00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:10.010
where the question was to search engines
actually cause more kind of

00:55:10.010 --> 00:55:10.020
actually cause more kind of
 

00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:12.500
actually cause more kind of
specialization let's say on conservative

00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:12.510
specialization let's say on conservative
 

00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:14.450
specialization let's say on conservative
versus liberal or do they allow you to

00:55:14.450 --> 00:55:14.460
versus liberal or do they allow you to
 

00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:16.790
versus liberal or do they allow you to
carve more niches and are we getting it

00:55:16.790 --> 00:55:16.800
carve more niches and are we getting it
 

00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:18.920
carve more niches and are we getting it
kind of more focused with search engines

00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:18.930
kind of more focused with search engines
 

00:55:18.930 --> 00:55:21.530
kind of more focused with search engines
or less focused and have you thought

00:55:21.530 --> 00:55:21.540
or less focused and have you thought
 

00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:23.300
or less focused and have you thought
about the role that search engines could

00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:23.310
about the role that search engines could
 

00:55:23.310 --> 00:55:27.260
about the role that search engines could
play basically or or news or news things

00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:27.270
play basically or or news or news things
 

00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:30.860
play basically or or news or news things
like Google News trying to tell people

00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:30.870
like Google News trying to tell people
 

00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:32.390
like Google News trying to tell people
at ok hey I've been watching your news

00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:32.400
at ok hey I've been watching your news
 

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.520
at ok hey I've been watching your news
reading patterns and you're really been

00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:34.530
reading patterns and you're really been
 

00:55:34.530 --> 00:55:36.920
reading patterns and you're really been
reading only liberal stuff so let me

00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:36.930
reading only liberal stuff so let me
 

00:55:36.930 --> 00:55:38.420
reading only liberal stuff so let me
recommend some things for you here so

00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:38.430
recommend some things for you here so
 

00:55:38.430 --> 00:55:41.210
recommend some things for you here so
you can a less biased view well I think

00:55:41.210 --> 00:55:41.220
you can a less biased view well I think
 

00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:42.860
you can a less biased view well I think
this is a really interesting question

00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:42.870
this is a really interesting question
 

00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:45.410
this is a really interesting question
and I mean you know I think the first

00:55:45.410 --> 00:55:45.420
and I mean you know I think the first
 

00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:47.540
and I mean you know I think the first
round of so when I first started lying

00:55:47.540 --> 00:55:47.550
round of so when I first started lying
 

00:55:47.550 --> 00:55:49.130
round of so when I first started lying
to study this actually like oh nine and

00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:49.140
to study this actually like oh nine and
 

00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:50.570
to study this actually like oh nine and
ten it turned out that actually the

00:55:50.570 --> 00:55:50.580
ten it turned out that actually the
 

00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:52.610
ten it turned out that actually the
level of personalization happening in

00:55:52.610 --> 00:55:52.620
level of personalization happening in
 

00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:54.440
level of personalization happening in
news just across the board was pretty

00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:54.450
news just across the board was pretty
 

00:55:54.450 --> 00:55:57.680
news just across the board was pretty
low so there was really nothing large to

00:55:57.680 --> 00:55:57.690
low so there was really nothing large to
 

00:55:57.690 --> 00:55:59.180
low so there was really nothing large to
study I mean it was happening but it was

00:55:59.180 --> 00:55:59.190
study I mean it was happening but it was
 

00:55:59.190 --> 00:56:00.920
study I mean it was happening but it was
just he was getting personalization

00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:00.930
just he was getting personalization
 

00:56:00.930 --> 00:56:02.450
just he was getting personalization
signals we're getting swamped by all the

00:56:02.450 --> 00:56:02.460
signals we're getting swamped by all the
 

00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:04.280
signals we're getting swamped by all the
other signals now I think it's growing

00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:04.290
other signals now I think it's growing
 

00:56:04.290 --> 00:56:07.760
other signals now I think it's growing
pretty substantially and you know the

00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:07.770
pretty substantially and you know the
 

00:56:07.770 --> 00:56:09.350
pretty substantially and you know the
naive algorithms are just going to try

00:56:09.350 --> 00:56:09.360
naive algorithms are just going to try
 

00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:11.240
naive algorithms are just going to try
to find publication of facts and so on

00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:11.250
to find publication of facts and so on
 

00:56:11.250 --> 00:56:12.440
to find publication of facts and so on
they're gonna say oh this this user

00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:12.450
they're gonna say oh this this user
 

00:56:12.450 --> 00:56:14.180
they're gonna say oh this this user
likes these kinds of publications so I'm

00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:14.190
likes these kinds of publications so I'm
 

00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:15.230
likes these kinds of publications so I'm
going to show them more publications

00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:15.240
going to show them more publications
 

00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:16.820
going to show them more publications
like that so they would create this

00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:16.830
like that so they would create this
 

00:56:16.830 --> 00:56:18.620
like that so they would create this
filter bubble and Facebook's algorithm

00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:18.630
filter bubble and Facebook's algorithm
 

00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:20.180
filter bubble and Facebook's algorithm
same thing they're not gonna show me

00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:20.190
same thing they're not gonna show me
 

00:56:20.190 --> 00:56:21.770
same thing they're not gonna show me
stuff I'm not gonna click on right and

00:56:21.770 --> 00:56:21.780
stuff I'm not gonna click on right and
 

00:56:21.780 --> 00:56:24.410
stuff I'm not gonna click on right and
sure they can observe this stuff and so

00:56:24.410 --> 00:56:24.420
sure they can observe this stuff and so
 

00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:26.860
sure they can observe this stuff and so
they're absolutely going to rank on it

00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:26.870
they're absolutely going to rank on it
 

00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:28.820
they're absolutely going to rank on it
there's a deeper question we actually

00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:28.830
there's a deeper question we actually
 

00:56:28.830 --> 00:56:30.470
there's a deeper question we actually
talking about this at lunch whether in

00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:30.480
talking about this at lunch whether in
 

00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:32.300
talking about this at lunch whether in
some sense this is where like the social

00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:32.310
some sense this is where like the social
 

00:56:32.310 --> 00:56:33.200
some sense this is where like the social
scientists could

00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:33.210
scientists could
 

00:56:33.210 --> 00:56:35.570
scientists could
and say gosh you know I know in the

00:56:35.570 --> 00:56:35.580
and say gosh you know I know in the
 

00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:37.370
and say gosh you know I know in the
short-term like this is the thing that's

00:56:37.370 --> 00:56:37.380
short-term like this is the thing that's
 

00:56:37.380 --> 00:56:39.050
short-term like this is the thing that's
gonna maximize whole page click-through

00:56:39.050 --> 00:56:39.060
gonna maximize whole page click-through
 

00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:40.430
gonna maximize whole page click-through
was to show you more of what you like

00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:40.440
was to show you more of what you like
 

00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:42.980
was to show you more of what you like
but maybe in the long term you're gonna

00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:42.990
but maybe in the long term you're gonna
 

00:56:42.990 --> 00:56:45.140
but maybe in the long term you're gonna
value this diverse perspective maybe

00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:45.150
value this diverse perspective maybe
 

00:56:45.150 --> 00:56:46.550
value this diverse perspective maybe
you're forming a perception about

00:56:46.550 --> 00:56:46.560
you're forming a perception about
 

00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:50.120
you're forming a perception about
neutrality and so on but it would be

00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:50.130
neutrality and so on but it would be
 

00:56:50.130 --> 00:56:52.670
neutrality and so on but it would be
very hard to measure that and so

00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:52.680
very hard to measure that and so
 

00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:53.750
very hard to measure that and so
tomorrow I'm going to talk about the

00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:53.760
tomorrow I'm going to talk about the
 

00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:56.330
tomorrow I'm going to talk about the
difficulty of short-termism in a

00:56:56.330 --> 00:56:56.340
difficulty of short-termism in a
 

00:56:56.340 --> 00:56:59.720
difficulty of short-termism in a
data-driven world but if you had a kind

00:56:59.720 --> 00:56:59.730
data-driven world but if you had a kind
 

00:56:59.730 --> 00:57:01.100
data-driven world but if you had a kind
of visionary person and you could

00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:01.110
of visionary person and you could
 

00:57:01.110 --> 00:57:02.780
of visionary person and you could
convince yourself somehow that this was

00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:02.790
convince yourself somehow that this was
 

00:57:02.790 --> 00:57:04.880
convince yourself somehow that this was
a true factor maybe some publications

00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:04.890
a true factor maybe some publications
 

00:57:04.890 --> 00:57:06.980
a true factor maybe some publications
could differentiate themselves by making

00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:06.990
could differentiate themselves by making
 

00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:08.960
could differentiate themselves by making
sure to provide a balanced perspective

00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:08.970
sure to provide a balanced perspective
 

00:57:08.970 --> 00:57:11.900
sure to provide a balanced perspective
but my fear is because it's so hard to

00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:11.910
but my fear is because it's so hard to
 

00:57:11.910 --> 00:57:13.820
but my fear is because it's so hard to
measure those long-term effects even if

00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:13.830
measure those long-term effects even if
 

00:57:13.830 --> 00:57:16.160
measure those long-term effects even if
someone had the idea in a data-driven

00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:16.170
someone had the idea in a data-driven
 

00:57:16.170 --> 00:57:18.650
someone had the idea in a data-driven
world they would get crushed because you

00:57:18.650 --> 00:57:18.660
world they would get crushed because you
 

00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:20.600
world they would get crushed because you
couldn't actually demonstrate might take

00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:20.610
couldn't actually demonstrate might take
 

00:57:20.610 --> 00:57:23.360
couldn't actually demonstrate might take
two years of watching a user before you

00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:23.370
two years of watching a user before you
 

00:57:23.370 --> 00:57:25.490
two years of watching a user before you
really get the benefits of showing that

00:57:25.490 --> 00:57:25.500
really get the benefits of showing that
 

00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:28.310
really get the benefits of showing that
diverse perspective and so you wouldn't

00:57:28.310 --> 00:57:28.320
diverse perspective and so you wouldn't
 

00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:30.110
diverse perspective and so you wouldn't
be able to document it even if it was

00:57:30.110 --> 00:57:30.120
be able to document it even if it was
 

00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:31.820
be able to document it even if it was
really there it's so much easier to

00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:31.830
really there it's so much easier to
 

00:57:31.830 --> 00:57:50.840
really there it's so much easier to
measure clicks yeah and I mean maybe

00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:50.850
measure clicks yeah and I mean maybe
 

00:57:50.850 --> 00:57:52.700
measure clicks yeah and I mean maybe
they could allow you to express that

00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:52.710
they could allow you to express that
 

00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:54.470
they could allow you to express that
that preference but I think they're

00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480
that preference but I think they're
 

00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:55.970
that preference but I think they're
probably worried about seeming creepy

00:57:55.970 --> 00:57:55.980
probably worried about seeming creepy
 

00:57:55.980 --> 00:57:58.190
probably worried about seeming creepy
you know like in some sense if you

00:57:58.190 --> 00:57:58.200
you know like in some sense if you
 

00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:00.020
you know like in some sense if you
realize if you tell people that that's

00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:00.030
realize if you tell people that that's
 

00:58:00.030 --> 00:58:01.670
realize if you tell people that that's
an option you know they might worry

00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:01.680
an option you know they might worry
 

00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:02.840
an option you know they might worry
about it so I think these are very

00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:02.850
about it so I think these are very
 

00:58:02.850 --> 00:58:06.080
about it so I think these are very
subtle subtle issues but I would not

00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:06.090
subtle subtle issues but I would not
 

00:58:06.090 --> 00:58:07.520
subtle subtle issues but I would not
predict that in the short-term you're

00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:07.530
predict that in the short-term you're
 

00:58:07.530 --> 00:58:09.140
predict that in the short-term you're
gonna see a lot of that I think it'll be

00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:09.150
gonna see a lot of that I think it'll be
 

00:58:09.150 --> 00:58:11.480
gonna see a lot of that I think it'll be
a longer time before we get and good

00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:11.490
a longer time before we get and good
 

00:58:11.490 --> 00:58:13.220
a longer time before we get and good
enough at measurement and people get

00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:13.230
enough at measurement and people get
 

00:58:13.230 --> 00:58:14.870
enough at measurement and people get
sophisticated enough that companies are

00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:14.880
sophisticated enough that companies are
 

00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:16.280
sophisticated enough that companies are
comfortable giving you those kinds of

comfortable giving you those kinds of
 

00:58:16.290 --> 00:58:18.890
comfortable giving you those kinds of
choices then you can just clear your

00:58:18.890 --> 00:58:18.900
choices then you can just clear your
 

00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:24.890
choices then you can just clear your
cookies in yep slice oh very interesting

00:58:24.890 --> 00:58:24.900
cookies in yep slice oh very interesting
 

00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:27.860
cookies in yep slice oh very interesting
and I'm wondering if you can the slice

00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:27.870
and I'm wondering if you can the slice
 

00:58:27.870 --> 00:58:29.330
and I'm wondering if you can the slice
can tell us something about like for

00:58:29.330 --> 00:58:29.340
can tell us something about like for
 

00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:32.020
can tell us something about like for
example the liberals and conservatives

they differ in their opinion because

you both sides are really neutral

their friends yes so I think those are

their friends yes so I think those are
 

00:58:52.859 --> 00:58:54.440
their friends yes so I think those are
incredibly interesting things and I

00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:54.450
incredibly interesting things and I
 

00:58:54.450 --> 00:58:55.880

do want to give the caveat that these

do want to give the caveat that these
 

00:58:57.150 --> 00:58:58.819

numbers are probably a little bit skewed

00:58:58.819 --> 00:58:58.829
numbers are probably a little bit skewed
 

00:58:58.829 --> 00:59:03.470

by my small sample but what I would

00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:03.480
by my small sample but what I would
 

00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:05.270
by my small sample but what I would
really want to do I think is collaborate

00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:05.280
really want to do I think is collaborate
 

00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:06.680
really want to do I think is collaborate
with Facebook on an experiment like that

00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:06.690
with Facebook on an experiment like that
 

00:59:06.690 --> 00:59:09.319
with Facebook on an experiment like that
and and actually do some randomization

00:59:09.319 --> 00:59:09.329
and and actually do some randomization
 

00:59:09.329 --> 00:59:11.690
and and actually do some randomization
at the user level and also like

00:59:11.690 --> 00:59:11.700
at the user level and also like

understand that but I think that's a

00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:16.890
understand that but I think that's a
 

00:59:16.890 --> 00:59:18.470

kind of experiment would be a little bit

00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:18.480
kind of experiment would be a little bit
 

00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:20.569
kind of experiment would be a little bit
hard for Facebook to do and to publish

00:59:20.569 --> 00:59:20.579
hard for Facebook to do and to publish
 

00:59:20.579 --> 00:59:22.250
hard for Facebook to do and to publish
just because again I think it'd be kind

00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:22.260
just because again I think it'd be kind
 

00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:24.710
just because again I think it'd be kind

don't want their the political bias of

don't want their the political bias of

don't want their the political bias of

to sort out why these things are

to sort out why these things are

that's basically right Facebook is the
farmers market Google is the farmers

01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:04.430
farmers market Google is the farmers
 

01:05:04.430 --> 01:05:06.280
farmers market Google is the farmers
market that's the platform that's the

01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:06.290
market that's the platform that's the
 

01:05:06.290 --> 01:05:08.530

middleman that gets all the returns

01:05:08.530 --> 01:05:08.540

the news organizations are

01:05:10.110 --> 01:05:10.120
the news organizations are

to get much surplus so I think that is a

01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:21.350
to get much surplus so I think that is a
 

01:05:21.350 --> 01:05:24.340
to get much surplus so I think that is a
fundamental problem and the only real

01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:24.350
fundamental problem and the only real
 

01:05:24.350 --> 01:05:26.230
fundamental problem and the only real
answers I can see mean there's things

01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:26.240
answers I can see mean there's things
 

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:28.030
answers I can see mean there's things
around the edges around different kinds

01:05:28.030 --> 01:05:28.040
around the edges around different kinds

around the edges around different kinds

01:05:29.590 --> 01:05:29.600
of advertising and subscription models
 

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:32.380
of advertising and subscription models
but ultimately I think that when because

but ultimately I think that when because

the intermediaries are big it's their

01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:34.130
the intermediaries are big it's their
 

01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:35.980
the intermediaries are big it's their
size that really allows them all the

01:05:38.170 --> 01:05:38.180
power the news media is gonna have to
 

01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:41.140
power the news media is gonna have to
get big in some way - which will give

01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:41.150
get big in some way - which will give
 

01:05:41.150 --> 01:05:43.000
get big in some way - which will give
them lots of economies of scale and data

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:43.010
them lots of economies of scale and data
 

01:05:43.010 --> 01:05:44.560
them lots of economies of scale and data
and they'll have better machine learning

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:44.570
and they'll have better machine learning
 

01:05:44.570 --> 01:05:46.810
and they'll have better machine learning
and they'll be faster and so on but on

01:05:46.810 --> 01:05:46.820
and they'll be faster and so on but on
 

01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:48.430
and they'll be faster and so on but on
the other hand we'll leave you know if

the other hand we'll leave you know if
it's all owned by Rupert Murdoch you

01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:51.230
it's all owned by Rupert Murdoch you
 

01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:53.410
it's all owned by Rupert Murdoch you
know that's gonna give us a smaller

01:05:53.410 --> 01:05:53.420
know that's gonna give us a smaller
 

01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:55.210

number of perspectives right so the call

01:05:55.210 --> 01:05:55.220
number of perspectives right so the call
 

01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:57.310
number of perspectives right so the call
to consolidation may go quite a ways and

01:05:57.310 --> 01:05:57.320
to consolidation may go quite a ways and
 

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:59.590
to consolidation may go quite a ways and
it also might kill local and certain

01:05:59.590 --> 01:05:59.600
it also might kill local and certain
 

01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:01.180
it also might kill local and certain
kinds of things so it's a little

01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:01.190
kinds of things so it's a little
 

01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:07.870
kinds of things so it's a little
depressing okay
