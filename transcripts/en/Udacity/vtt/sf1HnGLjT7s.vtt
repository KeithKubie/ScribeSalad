00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.900
Basically, and roughly speaking, requirements engineering, which is

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.630
also called in short, RE, is the process

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.520
of establishing the services that the customer requires

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.530
from the software system. In addition to that, requirements

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.360
engineering also has to do with the constraints

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.900
under which the system operates and is developed. Requirements

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.770
engineering is a very important activity for several

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.450
reasons. In particular, as we also saw in earlier

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.860
lessons, many errors are made in requirement specifications. So many

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.100
errors are made because we don't do requirements engineering in

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.670
the right way. And many of these errors are not

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.340
being detected early. But they could be if we were

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.350
to do RE in the right way. And, unfortunately, not

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.510
detecting these errors can dramatically increase software costs. So that's

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.250
the reason why requirements engineering is important, and why it

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.730
is important to do it in the right way. The final

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.660
result of the requirements engineering process is a software

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.230
requirements specification that we also called SRS. We will discuss

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.060
SRS later in more details and also when we talk

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.740
about the projects for the course. For now, it is

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.040
enough to say that the software requirements specification and

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.280
the requirements engineering, in general, should focus on what the

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.290
proposed system is intended to do, and not on the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.280
how it will do it. In fact, how the system

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.450
will do what it is required to do is something that we

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.170
will discuss when we talk about design of a system in later phases.
