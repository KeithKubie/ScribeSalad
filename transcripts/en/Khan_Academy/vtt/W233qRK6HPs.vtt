00:00:00.304 --> 00:00:02.219
- [Voiceover] So we have
the function g of x,

00:00:02.219 --> 00:00:05.864
which is equal to 2/x to
the third minus 1/x squared.

00:00:05.864 --> 00:00:07.817
And what I wanna do in this video,

00:00:07.817 --> 00:00:11.662
is I wanna find what g prime of x is

00:00:11.662 --> 00:00:15.376
and then I also wanna
evaluate that at x equal two,

00:00:15.376 --> 00:00:16.502
so I wanna figure that out.

00:00:16.502 --> 00:00:17.541
And I also wanna figure out what does

00:00:17.541 --> 00:00:19.737
that evaluate to when x is equal to two?

00:00:19.737 --> 00:00:21.132
So what is the slope
the of the tangent line

00:00:21.132 --> 00:00:24.947
to the graph of g, when x is equal to two?

00:00:24.947 --> 00:00:26.292
And like always, pause this video and

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:28.251
see if you can work this out on your own

00:00:28.251 --> 00:00:30.668
before I work through it with you.

00:00:30.668 --> 00:00:31.850
And I'll give you some hints

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.695
all you really need to do is

00:00:33.695 --> 00:00:36.450
apply the power rule, a little bit of

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.084
basic exponent properties

00:00:38.084 --> 00:00:41.906
and some basic derivative properties

00:00:41.906 --> 00:00:43.729
to be able to do this.

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:45.526
Alright, now let's just do this together

00:00:45.526 --> 00:00:46.495
and I'll just rewrite it.

00:00:46.495 --> 00:00:50.078
G of x is equal to this first term here,

00:00:51.378 --> 00:00:53.896
2/x to the third.

00:00:53.896 --> 00:00:56.362
Well, that could be rewritten as

00:00:56.362 --> 00:00:59.279
2 times x to the negative three.

00:01:00.624 --> 00:01:04.323
We know that 1/x to
the n is the same thing

00:01:04.323 --> 00:01:06.784
as x to the negative n.

00:01:06.784 --> 00:01:08.325
So I just rewrote it and this might

00:01:08.325 --> 00:01:10.255
be ringing a bell of how the power rule

00:01:10.255 --> 00:01:11.525
might be useful.

00:01:11.525 --> 00:01:13.451
And then we have minus-

00:01:13.451 --> 00:01:17.623
well, 1/x squared that is the same thing

00:01:17.623 --> 00:01:19.956
as x to the negative two.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.588
And so this, if we're gonna take

00:01:22.588 --> 00:01:24.486
the derivative of both sides of this,

00:01:24.486 --> 00:01:26.230
let's do that.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.647
Derivative with respect to x.

00:01:29.798 --> 00:01:32.527
Dx, we're gonna do that
on the left-hand side,

00:01:32.527 --> 00:01:36.374
we're also gonna do it
on the right-hand side.

00:01:36.374 --> 00:01:37.784
On the left-hand side, the derivative

00:01:37.784 --> 00:01:40.198
with respect to x of g of x,

00:01:40.198 --> 00:01:42.948
we can write that as g prime of x

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.175
is going to be equal to,

00:01:46.175 --> 00:01:48.343
well, the derivative of this first

00:01:48.343 --> 00:01:50.356
that we have right here written in green,

00:01:50.356 --> 00:01:52.459
this is going to be, we're just gonna

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:54.052
apply the power rule.

00:01:54.052 --> 00:01:57.255
We're going to take our exponent,

00:01:57.255 --> 00:02:00.070
multiply it by our coefficient out front,

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.145
actually let me write that out,

00:02:01.145 --> 00:02:02.895
that's going to be...

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:05.747
There's this equal sign.

00:02:05.747 --> 00:02:09.497
That is going to be two
times negative three,

00:02:11.803 --> 00:02:15.076
times x and now we're going
to decrement this exponent.

00:02:15.076 --> 00:02:16.277
You have to be very careful here

00:02:16.277 --> 00:02:17.427
because sometimes your brain might say,

00:02:17.427 --> 00:02:18.567
"Okay, one less than three is two,

00:02:18.567 --> 00:02:19.971
"so maybe this is x in the negative two."

00:02:19.971 --> 00:02:22.684
but remember, you're going down.

00:02:22.684 --> 00:02:25.233
So if you're at negative
three and you subtract one,

00:02:25.233 --> 00:02:26.478
we're gonna go with the negative three

00:02:26.478 --> 00:02:28.494
minus one power.

00:02:28.494 --> 00:02:30.167
We'll that's gonna take
us to negative four.

00:02:30.167 --> 00:02:33.577
So this is x to the negative four power.

00:02:33.577 --> 00:02:36.972
So two times negative three
x to the negative four,

00:02:36.972 --> 00:02:39.804
or we could have also written that as

00:02:39.804 --> 00:02:43.901
negative six x to the negative four power.

00:02:43.901 --> 00:02:45.401
And then, minus...

00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:47.884
Well, we're gonna do the same thing again

00:02:47.884 --> 00:02:49.049
right over here.

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.466
We take this negative two, multiply it by

00:02:54.033 --> 00:02:55.683
the coefficient that's implicitly here,

00:02:55.683 --> 00:02:56.568
you could say there's a one there.

00:02:56.568 --> 00:02:58.142
So negative two times one.

00:02:58.142 --> 00:03:00.248
So you have the negative two there

00:03:00.248 --> 00:03:02.471
and then you have the x to the-

00:03:02.471 --> 00:03:04.755
well what's a negative two minus one?

00:03:04.755 --> 00:03:06.598
That's negative three.

00:03:06.598 --> 00:03:08.287
To the negative three power.

00:03:08.287 --> 00:03:10.952
And so we can rewrite
all of this business as,

00:03:10.952 --> 00:03:13.285
the derivative g prime of x,

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.053
is equal to negative six,

00:03:17.053 --> 00:03:20.640
negative six x to the negative fourth.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.578
And now we're subtracting a negative.

00:03:22.578 --> 00:03:24.475
So we could just write this as,

00:03:24.475 --> 00:03:27.475
plus two x to the negative three.

00:03:29.114 --> 00:03:30.949
This negative cancels
out with that negative.

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:33.366
Subtract a negative, same
thing as adding a positive.

00:03:33.366 --> 00:03:34.806
So we did the first part.

00:03:34.806 --> 00:03:38.438
We can express g prime
of x as a function of x.

00:03:38.438 --> 00:03:41.663
Now, let's just evaluate
what g prime of two is.

00:03:41.663 --> 00:03:45.080
So g prime of two is going to be equal to

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.467
negative six times two to
the negative fourth power

00:03:51.732 --> 00:03:56.188
plus two times two to
the negative third power.

00:03:56.188 --> 00:03:57.926
Well, what's this going to be?

00:03:57.926 --> 00:04:01.810
This is equal to negative
6/2 to the fourth,

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.560
plus 2/2 to the third,

00:04:05.491 --> 00:04:09.319
which is equal to negative six over-

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.274
two to the fourth is 16,

00:04:11.274 --> 00:04:15.284
plus 2/2 to the third is eight.

00:04:15.284 --> 00:04:17.617
And so let's see, this is...

00:04:18.521 --> 00:04:20.662
Lets rewrite this all
with a common denominator.

00:04:20.662 --> 00:04:22.179
I could write this as 1/4,

00:04:22.179 --> 00:04:25.105
but then this one won't
work out as cleanly,

00:04:25.105 --> 00:04:26.874
I could write them both as eights.

00:04:26.874 --> 00:04:28.708
This is negative 3/8s.

00:04:28.708 --> 00:04:31.065
Negative 3/8s.

00:04:31.065 --> 00:04:33.929
So you have negative 3/8s plus two eights

00:04:33.929 --> 00:04:37.432
is equal to negative 1/8.

00:04:37.432 --> 00:04:40.976
So the slope of the tangent
line at x equals two,

00:04:40.976 --> 00:04:43.987
to the graph y equals g of x has a slope.

00:04:43.987 --> 00:04:47.154
That slope is negative 1/8.
