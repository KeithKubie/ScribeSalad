00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.960
The cars that satisfy either this condition or this

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.170
condition were the Fiat 128, the Honda Civic, the Lotus

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.810
Europa, and the Toyota Corolla. Let's see how we

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.841
can figure this out using "R". Your task was to

00:00:13.841 --> 00:00:16.921
determine which cars in the mtcars data set

00:00:16.921 --> 00:00:19.693
have MPG greater than or equal to 30 and an

00:00:19.693 --> 00:00:22.820
HP less than 60. To answer this question you

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.350
needed to subset the data frame. I'll show you two

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.490
ways of doing this. In the first method,

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.000
I'll use the subset command on empty cars, and

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.150
I want to get the cars whose mpg is greater

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.100
than or equal to 30 or whose horse power

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.870
is less than 60. That would be the Fiat,

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.280
the Honda Civic, the Toyota Corolla, and the Lotus

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.560
Europa. Using the bracket notation, the code syntax

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.810
would look like this, and there's the same output.
