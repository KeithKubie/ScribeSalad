BILL LUAN: Shanghai
GDG is a very

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.880
interesting developer community.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:13.710
SUSANNAH RAUB: I'm
glad somebody

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:14.990
has asked this question.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.149
RETO MEIER: This is where
the magic happens.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:17.440
JENNY MURPHY: This is primarily
a question and

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.000
answer show, so if any of you
out there would like to ask

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.810
questions--

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.580
ERIC GILMORE: Hello, I'm Eric
Gilmore, technical writer with

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.790
the Google Drive SDK.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.210
Here with me today is
Claudio Cherubino.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.610
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Hi.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:34.750
ERIC GILMORE: Claudio is going
to talk to us a little bit

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.230
about an application that he's
discovered recently, and we're

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.390
going to review it.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.900
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
Thank you, Eric.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.170
Today, we're going to talk about
Neutron Drive, which is

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.220
a web editor that uses Google
Drive for storage that is

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.430
available on the Chrome
Web Store.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.590
This web editor is targeted to
developers, and it has support

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.030
for many different programming
languages.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.120
What's cool is that you store
your files on the cloud so

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.340
that you can edit those files
wherever you are, from many

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.400
computers, and your files are
always there updated.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.440
Let's show it so we can
talk over it while

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.870
we see all the features.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.770
Obviously, we're going to
show all the features.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.180
We also found some room
for improvement.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.990
The goal of this session,
obviously, is to tell

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.180
developers out there how to
improve their applications and

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.080
how to provide their users
with the best experience.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.360
So nothing major from
Neutron Drive.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.640
It's actually a very good
application, but we still have

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.710
some minor suggestions.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.040
Let's see how to get started.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.540
Eric, can you start
showing where do

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.160
you get Neutron Drive?

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.520
ERIC GILMORE: Maybe we
should start right in

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.770
the Chrome Web Store.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.080
We can get a drive collection
here in the Chrome Web Store

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.550
and see only apps that--

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.500
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So there's
a collection of Drive

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.110
applications.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.169
You can reach it by going to
the Collections item in the

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:14.290
left side bar and then selecting
Google Drive.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.225
So you can see all the
applications that integrate

00:02:16.225 --> 00:02:20.570
with Google Drive and Neutron
Drive is one of those.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.410
ERIC GILMORE: I would point out
that it also works just to

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.900
put Drive the search box.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.220
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.940
And obviously, you can also
search for the application.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.980
But we know this application's
name.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.300
ERIC GILMORE: Let's search
for Neutron Drive.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.902
There it is.

00:02:32.902 --> 00:02:35.550
OK, now, Claudio, should
we go ahead and--

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.520
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: If you click
on it, we will see what

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.530
the application does.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.960
This is their promotional
page.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.430
You have screenshots.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.690
You have a video.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.080
You have the features.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.880
And even more important
for many users is

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.680
that you have reviews.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.750
So you can see what people think
about this application,

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.040
if it has good features or not,
and the stars which is a

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.960
rating, and so on.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.720
As I said, there are
many, many users

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.710
using this app already.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.060
There's thousands of users using
Neutron Drive already.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.350
ERIC GILMORE: You know what I
noticed about this that I

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.410
like, Claudio, is that there's
actually a change log

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.720
documentation here that
you can look at.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.920
I assume if you wanted to
upgrade Neutron Drive or if

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.705
you were waiting for a
particular feature or fix, you

00:03:22.705 --> 00:03:24.430
could find out about
it right here.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.720
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Cool.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.770
And they also have a
website which is

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.770
neutron-drive.appspot.com where
you can also see all the

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.950
informational URL, so you can
start if you don't want to

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.260
start from the Chrome website.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.880
ERIC GILMORE: Right.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.370
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So how do
we install Neutron Drive?

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:41.870
ERIC GILMORE: Let's go ahead and
pull the trigger and say

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.540
Add to Chrome.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.210
There's a little bit of
dissonance there, isn't it?

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.640
We're actually adding
this to Drive, but--

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.000
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Do you
need Chrome to use this?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.780
ERIC GILMORE: I don't
think you do.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:52.800
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: No, you
don't need Chrome.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.150
We made this special deal
for Drive applications.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.010
You can install Drive
applications

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.400
from inside any browser.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.160
Obviously, if you're inside
Chrome, when you install an

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.090
app, it will also show up in
the Chrome New Tab page.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.730
But if you're not in Chrome,
let's say you're using Mozilla

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.490
Firefox or Internet Explorer,
you will still install the

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.120
application on your
Drive account.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.370
But obviously, there's no New
Tab page that we are aware of.

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.640
There will be no link to it.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.920
ERIC GILMORE: That's the main
difference, isn't it?

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.540
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:27.790
ERIC GILMORE: OK,
let's click Add.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.760
As you said--

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.440
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Cute icon.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.790
ERIC GILMORE: --a very cute icon
with some pretty severe

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.380
canines shows up on
my New Tab page.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.240
I'll go ahead and click that.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.940
Now I think we're at one of our
first points we'd like to

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.930
discuss in terms of places that
Neutron Drive might be

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:46.780
able to improve.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.450
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah.

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.530
As all Drive applications, the
first time you start the

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.520
application, it will ask for
access to be able to read and

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.970
write resources according to
the application needs.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.190
So every time you start a new
application, every time you

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.340
install an application, you have
to carefully read what

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.590
the application wants to do
with your files and grant

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.710
access or not according
to your needs.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.410
So if we read what Neutron Drive
wants, what do we find?

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.890
ERIC GILMORE: It's a fairly long
list, and we can expand

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.680
each one of these items.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.130
It wants to view my basic
account information.

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.390
That's fairly standard.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.380
I think it'll need that.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.570
It wants to add itself
to Google Drive.

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.260
I have no quarrel with
that at all.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.700
It's going to appear in my Open
With and Create menus.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.100
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Which
is what we want.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.075
ERIC GILMORE: Google
Drive integration.

00:05:34.075 --> 00:05:35.440
That's terrific.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.710
View and manage the files and
documents in my Google Drive.

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.990
This is interesting because just
a couple bullets down, we

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.060
have View and Manage Google
Drive files that you have

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.850
opened or created
with this app.

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.350
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:54.130
This is something we think
Neutron Drive should change.

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.980
When you write an application
that integrates with Google

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:01.320
Drive, you, as a developer,
can select among many

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.070
different scopes your
application wants

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.320
to be able to access.

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.070
There is a wide scope, which is
a full scope, which is the

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:15.080
first one you read, so be able
to manage all the files on

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.800
your Google Drive.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.220
When you give access to an
application to all your files

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.750
with that scope, you're saying
that the application can read

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.850
and write all the files you
have in Google Drive.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.930
ERIC GILMORE: My drive is
your drive, basically.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:25.440
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yes.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.170
This is reasonable.

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:30.170
This is legit if the application
has a legitimate

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.940
need for it.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.220
So if, let's say, the
application wants to list all

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.570
your files, the application is
a file manager, it definitely

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:40.670
needs to be able to read and
write all your files.

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:44.190
If the application is something
else that doesn't

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.960
need that, you might want to
restrict the access only to

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.830
the files that the application
itself created.

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:55.940
In this case, Neutron Drive is
an editor that allows you to

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.560
list all your files in Drive.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.520
So they need the wider access.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.380
They need full access.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.720
But wider access
also includes--

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.560
if you have that, you can also
do everything you can also do

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.340
with the narrow scope.

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.530
So if you request the first
one, you then need to also

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:13.855
request the second one.

00:07:13.855 --> 00:07:17.290
And this can be confusing
for users.

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:20.320
ERIC GILMORE: I think it might
very well confuse a user who

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.950
was studying this closely.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:24.705
It really just will clean up
the screen a little bit to

00:07:24.705 --> 00:07:26.870
remove that one item.

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.160
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: This dialog
can be a bit scary because,

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.620
obviously, the user has to give

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.560
access to his own resources.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.100
They have to be careful.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.660
The bigger the message, the
bigger the list of things the

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.140
application can do,
the scarier it is.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.270
So as a developer, you want it
to be as concise as possible.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:45.510
ERIC GILMORE: This is something
that we promote as

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:49.250
our best practice in our Drive
SDK documentation, too.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:50.895
Do you mind if I click over to
that for a second, Claudio?

00:07:50.895 --> 00:07:53.200
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Sure.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.100
ERIC GILMORE: Here in our Drive
SDK, under the section

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:59.620
for building Drive web apps,
we give some authorization

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:02.085
guidance, including
how to choose auth

00:08:02.085 --> 00:08:04.650
scopes for your app.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.380
We list the scopes that
are available and

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.150
give you some details.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:13.090
We also have a recent video
with Ali Afshar starring.

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:13.270
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah.

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:16.200
We also cover this in a
recent recording of

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.560
Google Developers Live.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.800
If you want to read the page--

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.830
it's pretty short, so you
can actually read it.

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:24.985
But if you want, you can also
watch this video, and Ali

00:08:24.985 --> 00:08:28.780
Afshar, one of our teammates,
will go through each of the

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:31.870
available scopes and explain
when you should use it.

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:34.940
ERIC GILMORE: And to quote a
great technical writer, users

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.000
more readily grant access
to limited,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.720
clearly described scopes.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.508
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: What a
great technical writer.

00:08:40.508 --> 00:08:42.659
ERIC GILMORE: Thank
you, Claudio.

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:43.450
Anyway.

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:46.490
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So we also
found another minor thing in

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:48.720
this page, right?

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.840
If you select no if you don't
want to run access to the

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.600
application?

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.290
ERIC GILMORE: That's right.

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:53.900
Let's go see.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.260
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: The user can
say no, I don't want to.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:00.180
And what should happen is that
if you say no to the

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:03.850
application, you should go back
to the previous page, go

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:06.650
back to some other page that
says, well, you didn't grant

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:08.590
access so there's nothing
we can do.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.910
ERIC GILMORE: Some applications
will pop up a

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:13.360
little dialog saying you might
want to reconsider.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:13.890
We're quite harmless.

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:14.300
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yes.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.560
This is why we want this.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.825
This is why you should
give us access.

00:09:16.825 --> 00:09:19.820
This is what you're going
to miss if you

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.010
don't give us access.

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:25.120
Instead, what happens here, if
you click, you just get back

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.390
to the same page.

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:29.790
So the user has to close
the browser to

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:30.960
get rid of this message.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.653
ERIC GILMORE: That's not
what you want as

00:09:32.653 --> 00:09:33.550
an application developer.

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:35.260
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: But we want
to install Neutron Drive.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.350
It's a nice application,
so let's say we

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:39.480
grant access to it.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.860
ERIC GILMORE: All right.

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:42.110
Access is allowed.

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:47.210
Neutron Drive is opened
in a new tab.

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:47.870
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Perfect.

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:48.950
And what do we see?

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:50.120
ERIC GILMORE: Well,
here's the list of

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.150
all my files as promised.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:55.510
I gave it access as we
just mentioned, and

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:56.750
here they all are.

00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:01.780
And also, apparently I am
creating a new file.

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:03.260
I'm in a new file to create.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:04.240
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.490
Let's create a new file.

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:09.840
Put some interesting content.

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:16.370
More interesting content.

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:18.500
ERIC GILMORE: How's that?

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.350
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: You're
a tech writer.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:21.600
You know how to produce that
interesting content.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.040
ERIC GILMORE: I have
to be alone in a

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.520
cloister or a dark room--

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.030
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Oh, yeah.

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:26.010
ERIC GILMORE: --feeling
my angst.

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:26.340
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: OK.

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:29.590
Now let's save it.

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:33.500
One of the cool features about
Neutron Drive is that it

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.580
auto-saves documents
you're editing.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.375
But this is a totally new file,
so you can also click on

00:10:38.375 --> 00:10:41.990
the Force Save button to save
all of the open files.

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:43.340
ERIC GILMORE: Done.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.280
I did not name it, however.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:49.250
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: We didn't
create one from scratch.

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:53.205
So this is actually another
small thing that the

00:10:53.205 --> 00:10:54.260
application can fix.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.280
So the user is there and
believes that he's already

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.990
editing a file, while the user
is not because we didn't

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.890
create any file.

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:03.690
So we should make clear that--

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:06.220
I mean, the application says
something like, you should

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:07.440
open a file or create a new one

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.540
before you can do anything.

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:12.590
But it still allows users to
type and delete that message

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:13.790
and write the content.

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:16.470
And maybe it's too late when
they realize that the

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:17.950
applications are not
really saving.

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:19.845
ERIC GILMORE: Now, Claudio,
you're more familiar with this

00:11:19.845 --> 00:11:20.830
app than I am at this point.

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:24.520
How do I get started
creating a file?

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.740
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Let's say
you want to create a file.

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:32.430
You can also show the Drive
integration from the Drive UI.

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:33.640
ERIC GILMORE: Let's
come over here.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.810
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: You probably
have to refresh the

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:37.105
page so the application
gets installed.

00:11:37.105 --> 00:11:39.140
ERIC GILMORE: Sorry, Claudio.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:40.410
You're right.

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:41.660
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: And then
once the application is

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:45.400
installed, we can open files
from it or create

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.810
new files from it.

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:48.600
It should be there.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.250
ERIC GILMORE: It's not.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:55.050
Should I completely reopen--

00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:02.710
and still thinking.

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:04.380
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
We're having some

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:06.860
internet access issues.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:09.490
ERIC GILMORE: Is it possible
that it isn't integrated for--

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:10.310
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: It's
going to be installed.

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:12.340
Let's go back to the app
and show what you

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:14.660
can do with the app.

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:16.130
First of all, I want to
show you what you can

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:17.800
do with this app.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.750
This application supports
opening from there.

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:23.030
So let's say you want to
open a file from there.

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:26.830
So you have the list of files,
but you also have a picker.

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:31.510
So with the picker, what you
see is the complete list of

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:35.950
files in your application.

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:42.520
This can be fine, but this
dialog lists all the files you

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:46.330
have in Drive, not just
the supported ones.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.550
So in your Drive, there might
be text files that this

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:51.560
application can open, but there
can also be some files

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.260
your application doesn't know
what to do with them.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.610
So I think a better user
experience would be to only

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:01.520
list those files the application
knows it can open.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.820
So what happened if you
want to open one?

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:04.480
ERIC GILMORE: Let's try this.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.250
How about terrier.jpg?

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:09.220
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: OK, which
is clearly an image.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:11.700
ERIC GILMORE: Let's
see what we get.

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.640
My text editor is apparently
trying to

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.140
open that image file.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:16.910
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah.

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:19.560
As we said, you're going to get
a dialog that says this

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:20.740
file isn't supported.

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:22.560
So you have two options--

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:27.370
open it in Google Docs or try
to open it in Neutron Drive.

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:30.740
This can be the expected
behavior from this app.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.010
I'm not sure this is the best
user experience, though.

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:36.620
You, as a developer--

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:39.830
Neutron Drive definitely knows
this file cannot be opened.

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:43.270
So I would probably just filter
that list from the

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:46.740
picker dialogue and show only
the files we know the

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:47.690
application can open.

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:49.020
ERIC GILMORE: Do you want to
take a quick look at our

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:49.780
picker code sample?

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:49.861
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah.

00:13:49.861 --> 00:13:52.980
How do we do that
with the picker?

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.760
ERIC GILMORE: Let's come down
here to integrate with the

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:58.820
Drive UI and look at the topic
about opening files, which is

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:01.700
essentially what we do
with the picker.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:04.790
Down here, there's a
familiar-looking screen, the

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:07.680
one we were just looking at, and
a sample to show how you

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.800
might open that within
a browser.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:14.980
Here, I wish we had line numbers
and things to show

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:17.710
you, but we will highlight
this line.

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:19.580
Correct me if I'm wrong,
Claudio, but I think this is

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:21.340
the key to filtering
MIME types.

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:21.640
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: It is.

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:25.470
So the picker API is a simple
JavaScript API that you can

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:28.570
embed in your application.

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:33.320
With that, you can open these
dialogs you've seen to open

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:37.720
files, to save files, and to
get images, to get all the

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.830
files, but you can also filter
to some specific MIME types.

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:43.580
And this is what I think Neutron
Drive should do.

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:47.460
They should list the file types
they can support and

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:48.680
only show them.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:52.810
Also because this is what the
application does when you open

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:55.900
a file from the Drive UI.

00:14:55.900 --> 00:15:01.990
It is not consistent what the
user can do from the Drive UI,

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:08.610
where they can only open a text
file and what a user can

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:14.250
do from inside the application
itself from the picker dialog.

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:19.640
I think that it is not bad, but
it has to be consistent.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.250
ERIC GILMORE: By the way, this
example was for an image

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:25.600
editor, so it only does
PNGs, JPGs, and JPEGs.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.850
Logical enough.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.140
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: What
else can we show?

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:38.520
If you go and open the top
menus, you will see that there

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:44.720
are some options to select what
type of file highlighting

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:49.360
we want and so on because this
application is a very powerful

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.310
text editor.

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:54.940
So if you want to, you can have
syntax highlighting for

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:57.290
different file types.

00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:01.670
If you go to the menu and select
Editor Mode, you will

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.350
see that there are many

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:06.120
programming languages supported.

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:08.160
For each of them, you get a
syntax highlighting, which is

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.490
very useful as a developer.

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:15.720
If not, you will only get
standard text file.

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:16.900
ERIC GILMORE: This really
is terrific.

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:19.510
Everything under the
sun is in here.

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:21.920
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: From there,
if you close this, from the

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.790
same menu, you can also create
a new file, which is what we

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:25.890
wanted to do before, right?

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:28.380
So you open the same menu and
there is a New File option.

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:29.120
ERIC GILMORE: Which menu?

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:29.770
I'm sorry, Claudio.

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:30.020
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: That menu.

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:33.560
ERIC GILMORE: By the way, can
I do YAML highlighting?

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:34.960
I may even have a YAML file.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.690
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: That is
a pair file setting.

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:38.650
So you select that every
time you open a

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:39.280
file or create a file.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.930
So the second option in this
menu is a new file.

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:44.040
When you do that, you get a
dialog, and you have to

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.950
specify a name.

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:48.665
It might be easy to just specify
a name and not an

00:16:48.665 --> 00:16:51.920
extension, which is what
we're going to do.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:52.330
ERIC GILMORE: Correct.

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:52.790
Sorry.

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:56.010
I don't want to cause any
difficulties for your test.

00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:58.580
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Most users
will open this dialog and

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:03.450
specify a file name, a title,
but not an extension, assuming

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:08.470
that the application will know
how to open this file, right?

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:15.380
But apparently Neutron Drive
detects what files it can open

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:18.349
by checking the extension
instead of the MIME type.

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:21.470
Or maybe the MIME type is not
set when we created the file.

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:25.880
And so even if we created a file
with Neutron Drive, when

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.349
we try to open it back, which
is what is happening right

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:31.505
now, Neutron Drive
believes that the

00:17:31.505 --> 00:17:33.470
file cannot be opened.

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:37.290
And actually, if you click on
try to open it anyway, it will

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:39.670
work properly because
this is a text file.

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:46.090
Neutron Drive is capable
of opening it.

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:49.110
So let's add something
and save.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:52.140
With Neutron Drive, you're going
to have multiple files

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:55.260
open at the same
time with tabs.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:59.580
So if you want, you can create
a new file, open a file from

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.870
your file list, and so on, and
save all of them at the same

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:04.290
time when you work on them.

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:10.690
When you save a file
on Google Drive, we

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:12.950
save multiple revisions.

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:16.130
So we keep track of the changes
you make to the

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.690
document, and we call
them revisions.

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:24.040
At any time from inside Neutron
Drive, you can also

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:28.140
see the list of available
revisions and go back in time

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:31.740
and go back to one of those and
see what happened since

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:32.960
then and so on.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:37.010
So let's say you saved and from
the same menu, which is

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:40.080
the main Neutron Drive
menu, you get a

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.330
revision history file.

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:47.420
This will list multiple changes

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:48.460
we made to the document.

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:51.760
For each of them, we can
see what was in that

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.010
version of the file.

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:57.290
And if we want to go back in
time, we can just revert to

00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:58.210
that revision.

00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:00.650
Do you want to open just one
of those just to see?

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:01.900
ERIC GILMORE: Want to revert
back before I--

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:02.620
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Let's
open it first.

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:04.790
Let's see what happens.

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:07.230
View a revision first.

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:08.600
This is the latest one, right?

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:09.520
ERIC GILMORE: Let's go back.

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:10.890
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So you
go to revision history--

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:14.100
ERIC GILMORE: And it's pretty
remarkable that this is some

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:16.175
nonsense that I typed in the
past five minutes, and there

00:19:16.175 --> 00:19:17.470
are five revisions here.

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:17.820
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah.

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:22.550
So if you go and click on View
Revision, you will see what

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:25.040
the content was at that time.

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.970
And if you like it, if this is
what you were looking for, you

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:30.910
can revert to it and go back to
that version of the file.

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:35.280
Or not.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.240
ERIC GILMORE: Hang on.

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:37.750
Let's try one more time.

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:40.730
Or do you want to just
try reverting

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:44.730
straight from that menu?

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:45.610
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: We can try.

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:47.280
ERIC GILMORE: That's the one
I was trying to get.

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.960
I am sure I want to revert, even
without looking at it.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.010
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: OK.

00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:58.780
See, there's some minor UI
glitches that we would like

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:00.420
this application to fix.

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:04.600
So you tried to revert to a
revision, and you don't know

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.920
if that is working or not.

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:09.860
You click on Revert and you
don't get any visual

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:13.640
confirmation, things like that,
small things that can

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.960
make this application
even better.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.270
ERIC GILMORE: Another attempt
just worked, Claudio.

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:20.560
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.920
Things like that will make
the experience better.

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:27.430
If something fails, they should
be able to catch it,

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:29.890
show a proper error message like
they do, but maybe in a

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:31.510
more friendly way.

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:32.820
Small things, right?

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:34.990
ERIC GILMORE: And this is
a nice-to-have feature.

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:37.820
I think we were demonstrating
it to show what a great

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:41.530
integration they've done with
our revisions collection.

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:43.240
And we would just urge
the developers--

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.780
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: If developers
want to learn about

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:47.310
revision, where should
they go?

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:49.910
ERIC GILMORE: We do again have
a topic in the Google Drive

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:53.640
SDK documentation that will
get you up to speed on

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:56.780
managing revisions.

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:59.990
It's brief, short and sweet,
but it links you into the

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:01.480
details that you need--

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.100
oh, my word.

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:04.960
That's not good.

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.510
Let's find those details.

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:09.866
It's happening to
us too, today.

00:21:09.866 --> 00:21:11.180
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
What a great day.

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:11.910
ERIC GILMORE: It's the--

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:12.860
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
It's Monday.

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:14.810
ERIC GILMORE: --phase of
the moon or something.

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:17.000
Here are the details
right here.

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:20.870
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: This is one
of the things you can do with

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:22.250
the Drive SDK.

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:25.910
You can manage revisions
as well as files.

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:29.010
Any time programmatically, as
you can do from the UI, you

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:32.970
can also manage the content
of previous revisions.

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:34.290
Cool.

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:37.890
There are some other nice
features in Neutron Drive.

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:43.340
We're not going through all of
them today, but remember--

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:45.640
let's say, if you go to the
Preference menu and the

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.630
Preference option in the menu,
there are some other

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:51.420
preferences you can set that
might be interesting for

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:51.830
developers.

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:56.230
So if you want to use tabs, font
size, what kind of editor

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:57.540
you want to use, and so on.

00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:02.240
And also, it supports
keyboard shortcuts.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.860
Fast developers usually
use a lot of keyboard.

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:07.130
So there's a lot of things you
can do as a developer with

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:08.470
Neutron Drive.

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:15.400
I think this is an amazing tool
if you want to write code

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.070
wherever you are.

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:17.270
What do you think?

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:18.120
ERIC GILMORE: I would
agree with that.

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:19.990
I think if you're an independent
developer or a

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:23.030
developer in a small company,
it could work really well to

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:26.010
use this type of an editor
and use Google

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:27.320
Drive as your storage.

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:31.950
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: This is a
very easy revision control

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:34.150
tool you can have
for your source.

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:37.120
Obviously, there are tools
that do these things

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:40.970
specifically, so there are
revision control tools that

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:42.390
you can use.

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:44.530
You probably need to set
up a server and so on.

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:47.240
But if you want something very
easy to get started with an

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:50.830
editor, this is probably
very good for you.

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:52.540
ERIC GILMORE: And it comes
with all the bells and

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:56.650
whistles that Drive offers
in terms of sharing and

00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:57.900
collaborative editing.

00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:59.720
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Did
we mention it's free?

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.240
ERIC GILMORE: Completely free.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.940
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Cool.

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:06.640
With that, I think we covered
Neutron Drive.

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:09.630
We know Neutron Drive is active
on Google+, and we are

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:10.590
active as well.

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:13.530
So we would love to hear your
feedback and we would love to

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:15.530
hear feedback from
Neutron Drive.

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:20.670
And if you have any questions
on Drive development, how to

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:24.760
integrate your apps with Drive,
you can get in touch

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:27.040
with us on Google+ or
on Stack Overflow

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:27.970
for technical questions.

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:30.640
They would be very happy
to help you.

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:33.530
ERIC GILMORE: In fact, should I
show on the screen our tag?

00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:34.490
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Please do.

00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:36.620
ERIC GILMORE: We do have
probably the most important

00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:39.210
page in the entire Drive SDK.

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:40.810
Here's how to ask us
a question about

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:41.940
Google Drive SDK.

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:43.570
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: And you
probably recognize some of

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:44.760
those faces.

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:46.760
ERIC GILMORE: There's one
of them right there.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:47.230
Let's see.

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:49.510
We have Ali Afshar with
15,000 points.

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:51.740
I just got my first
30 the other day.

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:52.490
I'm just starting.

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:53.900
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Cool.

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:57.720
And with that happy note,
we're done for today.

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.990
Thank you very much
for watching us.

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:02.290
See you next time on Google
Developers Live.

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:03.580
Bye.
