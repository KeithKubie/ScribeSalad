&gt;&gt;Steven: A lot of people think that
Project Based Learning is fluff.

00:00:05.326 --> 00:00:09.086
So what we did, instead of having
a three-column rubric that has

00:00:09.126 --> 00:00:12.916
"Unsatisfactory, Proficient and
Advanced," we added a fourth column.

00:00:13.026 --> 00:00:15.246
It is the "Standards,"
what has to be taught.

00:00:15.476 --> 00:00:17.926
&gt;&gt;Peggy: Students are going to
address the content that they need

00:00:17.926 --> 00:00:20.636
to learn through this PBL approach.

00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:23.526
PBL provides the meat
of the curriculum.

00:00:23.526 --> 00:00:26.666
It's not a side thing you do
at the end of the unit for fun.

00:00:26.976 --> 00:00:29.806
It's really how you're engaging
students in that content learning.

00:00:30.386 --> 00:00:32.926
&gt;&gt;Lisa: I start with
the standards in mind.

00:00:32.926 --> 00:00:34.326
It's called "Backwards Design."

00:00:34.886 --> 00:00:36.216
And so you start with the standards,

00:00:36.216 --> 00:00:39.236
you start with what the
final exam would look like.

00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:44.306
Again, we still do have final
exams, and unit exams at the end

00:00:44.306 --> 00:00:47.376
of each topic that we're learning,
because they need that practice.

00:00:47.896 --> 00:00:51.726
And so I make the test ahead
of time, and then I plan all

00:00:51.726 --> 00:00:54.516
of the appropriate activities that
we're going to do for the project.

00:00:54.516 --> 00:00:58.216
&gt;&gt;Steven: Our students
still take assessments,

00:00:58.646 --> 00:01:00.496
district assessments, and benchmarks.

00:01:00.756 --> 00:01:02.986
We still have that
accountability factor.

00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:05.406
And when our students
then perform very well

00:01:05.406 --> 00:01:07.496
on those, it shows it works.

00:01:07.786 --> 00:01:09.446
&gt;&gt;Peggy: There's really
two main reasons

00:01:09.446 --> 00:01:12.216
that a teacher should
use a PBL approach.

00:01:12.216 --> 00:01:15.076
And one is that the students
will learn disciplinary content.

00:01:15.076 --> 00:01:16.016
I mean, that's critical.

00:01:16.016 --> 00:01:18.396
But the second equally
important reason to use it is

00:01:18.396 --> 00:01:21.576
that students develop critical
thinking skills while they're

00:01:21.576 --> 00:01:22.596
learning the content.

00:01:22.596 --> 00:01:24.256
They learn to collaborate
with others.

00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:26.486
They have the opportunity to be
creative in the way they think

00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:28.536
about the problem, and
then to put their own spin

00:01:28.596 --> 00:01:30.616
on their solution to the problem.

00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:33.686
&gt;&gt;Steven: It's a shift in
the delivery of instruction.

00:01:34.116 --> 00:01:36.736
Students at this school
not only get the knowledge,

00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:38.836
but they learn the application.

00:01:38.836 --> 00:01:42.246
So the knowledge then becomes
relevant when they have to apply it

00:01:42.246 --> 00:01:46.286
to a real-world situation.
