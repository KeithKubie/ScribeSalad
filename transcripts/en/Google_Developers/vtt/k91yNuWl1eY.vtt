frnltsz welcome.  Thank you for 
joining.

00:14:07.284 --> 00:14:09.284
Our session will begin soon

00:14:54.838 --> 00:14:55.944
Welcome.  Thank you for joining.
Our session will begin soon.  

00:14:57.865 --> 00:14:59.865
&gt;&gt;

00:18:48.514 --> 00:18:51.809
   (Applause.) 
   &gt;&gt; All right.  All right.  

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:53.810
Hello everyone.  
   &gt;&gt; Hello.  

00:18:53.862 --> 00:18:55.888
&gt;&gt; How are you doing?  
   &gt;&gt; Good.  

00:18:56.085 --> 00:18:58.085
&gt;&gt; Good.

00:18:59.357 --> 00:19:00.981
I hope there is still some more 
people coming in probably 

00:19:00.982 --> 00:19:03.218
getting out from the keynote.  I
really appreciate that you came 

00:19:03.219 --> 00:19:07.104
here to watch my part.  I am 
going to talk about build a 

00:19:09.587 --> 00:19:10.631
powerful data Backend for mobile
and web.  A little bit about 

00:19:10.632 --> 00:19:12.632
myself.

00:19:15.144 --> 00:19:17.808
I am a cloud developer advocate.
I am the interface between the 

00:19:17.809 --> 00:19:19.809
people 

00:19:21.496 --> 00:19:24.131
that build the technology in 
Google and the people that build

00:19:24.132 --> 00:19:27.657
the technology outside of 
Google.  Hopefully you guys and 

00:19:27.658 --> 00:19:31.143
girls take something out this 
talk and build something amazing

00:19:31.144 --> 00:19:33.205
afterwards.  
Before I start I want to get a 

00:19:33.206 --> 00:19:35.843
little bit of a feel who am I 
talking to.

00:19:38.911 --> 00:19:41.363
So who of you here is a 
developer?  All right.  That's 

00:19:41.364 --> 00:19:43.364
amazing.  You are in the right 
place.

00:19:46.298 --> 00:19:51.056
Who is an Android developer?  
Who has done something 

00:19:51.057 --> 00:19:54.098
Firebased?  A lot.  Backend 
developers?

00:20:00.055 --> 00:20:02.055
Anyone who developers with go 
lang.

00:20:03.925 --> 00:20:05.925
So my favorite languages are go 
lang and Java.

00:20:08.156 --> 00:20:10.156
So I'm going to

00:20:12.753 --> 00:20:15.594
stick to Java in this talk.  So 
if we choose the right storage 

00:20:15.595 --> 00:20:20.771
it is really big problem.  This 
is really hard to do.  So we 

00:20:20.772 --> 00:20:23.000
have a lot of things to consider
when you choose your storage 

00:20:23.001 --> 00:20:27.086
system.  So things like what's 
the object size.  What's the 

00:20:27.087 --> 00:20:29.087
scale that you need.

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:32.659
What latency requirements 
throughput consistencies, and 

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:34.660
like permissions, things like 
that.

00:20:37.044 --> 00:20:39.277
So there are a lot of things 
that you need consider when you 

00:20:39.278 --> 00:20:42.327
choosing the right storage 
system.  When I created this 

00:20:42.328 --> 00:20:47.475
talk I was thinking about what 
am I going to talk about or how 

00:20:47.476 --> 00:20:49.708
am I going to construct this 
talk.  I was wondering if I 

00:20:49.709 --> 00:20:55.052
should start with something -- I
have to get it out.  Start like 

00:20:55.053 --> 00:20:57.710
20 years ago pretty much where 
you had like storage systems 

00:20:57.711 --> 00:20:59.756
which are mostly local.  Things 
like that.  Who still remembers 

00:20:59.757 --> 00:21:06.112
this?  Right?   
I actually even started with the

00:21:06.113 --> 00:21:11.733
5 and quarter Sol and diskettes 
but they are pretty amazing of 

00:21:11.734 --> 00:21:14.410
but I thought that I am going to
bore you with history like 20 

00:21:14.411 --> 00:21:16.655
years ago.  It is really 
interesting and everyone should 

00:21:16.656 --> 00:21:19.293
look in to that.  But we are 
living in the now and almost in 

00:21:19.294 --> 00:21:22.756
the future.  So I am going to 
talk a little bit about the 

00:21:22.757 --> 00:21:24.757
things that you can do today.  
Okay?

00:21:27.436 --> 00:21:30.104
So I'm going to do that.  I 
didn't want to go through like a

00:21:31.545 --> 00:21:34.412
talk in the sense of talking you
through the different options 

00:21:34.413 --> 00:21:36.413
that you have like 

00:21:39.038 --> 00:21:44.005
Firebased or with good Google 
Cloud Platform.  Let's do this 

00:21:44.006 --> 00:21:46.654
and create a sample app.  Here 
is my startup idea.  

00:21:50.348 --> 00:21:51.558
I'm cloud developer advocate.  
For me everything is about the 

00:21:51.559 --> 00:21:54.403
cloud.  My startup idea is 
cloudy.pictures.

00:21:58.319 --> 00:22:00.319
Concentrate on one thing and do 
one thing well.

00:22:02.053 --> 00:22:04.968
This is where I want to get to 
by the end of the talk.  I want 

00:22:04.969 --> 00:22:06.826
an app where I can upload 
pictures and where you can crop 

00:22:06.827 --> 00:22:10.369
and resize the picture.  Where 
you can store metadata and then,

00:22:12.597 --> 00:22:15.863
of course, display the pictures.
Right.  So what do we have in 

00:22:15.864 --> 00:22:17.864
terms of options?

00:22:20.367 --> 00:22:22.367
Now I saw a couple of you are 
Firebase developers.

00:22:24.229 --> 00:22:25.445
For the ones that haven't 
touched or have touched Firebase

00:22:25.446 --> 00:22:28.909
so far, I really recommend to 
look in to that.  Firebase gives

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:30.910
you a lot of things, a lot of 
tools to build applications.

00:22:34.839 --> 00:22:38.603
Especially mobile applications. 
You have things like 

00:22:38.604 --> 00:22:40.604
authentication, 

00:22:44.229 --> 00:22:47.044
hosting, fire store which gives 
you flexible data storage and 

00:22:47.045 --> 00:22:50.947
you have something that can 
execute code called cloud 

00:22:50.948 --> 00:22:53.720
functions for Firebase.  Now 
there might be situations where 

00:22:55.028 --> 00:22:57.028
you have to get out of this.

00:23:00.325 --> 00:23:02.953
Where you want to do a little 
bit more sophisticated tasks.  

00:23:02.954 --> 00:23:04.954
Things that you can't cover with
cloud function.

00:23:07.891 --> 00:23:10.133
There are limit ations with 
cloud functions.  So that's 

00:23:10.134 --> 00:23:12.134
where Google Cloud Platform 
comes in.

00:23:14.399 --> 00:23:16.399
With Google Cloud Platform you 
have a 

00:23:17.659 --> 00:23:19.659
multitude of tools at your 
disposal that you can use.

00:23:22.698 --> 00:23:25.691
You have compute that you can do
everything you want, almost.

00:23:28.702 --> 00:23:30.751
Up to cloud functions as well.  
So you have multitude of compute

00:23:30.752 --> 00:23:32.598
that you can use to do your 
things.  We have a multitude of 

00:23:32.599 --> 00:23:36.666
storage products under the 
Google cloud portfolio.  Some of

00:23:36.667 --> 00:23:38.667
these products are actually 

00:23:40.722 --> 00:23:42.791
the exact same products that you
can use with Firebase.  You have

00:23:42.792 --> 00:23:44.792
different interfaces to the 

00:23:46.288 --> 00:23:47.504
same product which makes 
actually easier to deal with 

00:23:47.505 --> 00:23:49.535
them for different use cases.  
So if you build a web app and it

00:23:49.536 --> 00:23:52.396
is easier to use the Firebase 
SDK.

00:23:55.461 --> 00:23:57.461
If you build Backend system you 
can 

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.975
use like outline library on the 
Google Cloud Platform.  So the 

00:24:01.976 --> 00:24:03.608
first thing when we upload a 
picture we need a place to store

00:24:03.609 --> 00:24:06.053
our pictures.  So that's where 
Google cloud storage 

00:24:09.537 --> 00:24:11.162
comes in or cloud storage for 
Firebase.  They are both the 

00:24:11.163 --> 00:24:13.163
same product.  

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:18.148
The product is actually highly 
available durable and similar 

00:24:18.149 --> 00:24:22.813
object storage.  What is an 
object storage.  It is pretty 

00:24:22.814 --> 00:24:27.106
every kind of block that you can
think of.  B block is bytes.

00:24:30.625 --> 00:24:33.266
It can be images, videos, normal
files.  It can be pretty much be

00:24:33.267 --> 00:24:35.267
any byte stream that you can 
find.

00:24:37.999 --> 00:24:40.244
Now cloud storage is optimized 
for user latency for end user 

00:24:40.245 --> 00:24:42.245
latency.  There are a lot of 
things that you can do.

00:24:46.197 --> 00:24:48.264
You can define the caching 
strategy and you can make object

00:24:48.265 --> 00:24:50.265
storage public 

00:24:52.339 --> 00:24:54.339
so that people outside can 
connect in a 

00:24:56.008 --> 00:24:58.008
sense that other people pay for 
the 

00:24:59.063 --> 00:25:01.063
access to your cloud storage 
system.

00:25:03.136 --> 00:25:05.405
It is integrated with over 100 
end points or cloud puffs that 

00:25:05.406 --> 00:25:08.051
we call.  If somebody comes in 
from let's say 

00:25:11.742 --> 00:25:13.970
Asia or Europe he go to the 
closest puff that is connected 

00:25:13.971 --> 00:25:16.011
to their Internet service 
provider and they go directly in

00:25:17.436 --> 00:25:19.436
to our Google network.

00:25:22.742 --> 00:25:24.969
The latency to retrieve or store
objects is minimized.  

00:25:27.272 --> 00:25:29.272
So we are going to start with 
creating a packet.

00:25:31.169 --> 00:25:33.614
A packet is is a unique root end
point.  You have to create to be

00:25:33.615 --> 00:25:36.687
able to store some data.  When 
you create a buck kelt you 

00:25:36.688 --> 00:25:38.688
define 

00:25:40.383 --> 00:25:42.451
things like the storage class 
and the location where your 

00:25:42.452 --> 00:25:46.108
bucket lives.  So in this case 
as you can see here I have two 

00:25:46.109 --> 00:25:48.109
examples.

00:25:49.997 --> 00:25:52.023
Either you use our CLI where 
GSU, you make a bucket and 

00:25:52.024 --> 00:25:54.260
define the storage class, in 
this class it is multi 

00:25:58.544 --> 00:26:00.833
regional and then my storage is 
cloudy.pictures.  You can do the

00:26:00.834 --> 00:26:02.834
same with Java.

00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:06.536
If you want to create packets 
you can use our storage APIs and

00:26:06.537 --> 00:26:08.537
then basically 

00:26:09.594 --> 00:26:11.594
directly created from your Java 
program.  

00:26:12.234 --> 00:26:14.276
The next step is uploading your 
file.  Again very easy if you 

00:26:14.277 --> 00:26:16.922
are familiar with CP on any kind
of operating system, 

00:26:23.021 --> 00:26:25.264
you just prepend it with GSUlT 
which allows you to multicast 

00:26:25.265 --> 00:26:27.265
your upload and 

00:26:28.944 --> 00:26:30.944
then you upload a picture here 
to our cloud store packet.

00:26:34.618 --> 00:26:37.669
In Java pretty much simple and 
straightforward as well.  You 

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:39.956
select the file, you point to a 
file and make byte stream, byte 

00:26:39.957 --> 00:26:41.957
area out of it.

00:26:43.661 --> 00:26:45.661
You put it in and create with a 
name as you can see here.

00:26:50.709 --> 00:26:52.709
In this example I gave it the 
content 

00:26:53.975 --> 00:26:56.120
type that you can do as well.  
If you want do it for the ones 

00:26:56.121 --> 00:26:59.394
that have done Firebase this 
looks familiar.  You use a 

00:26:59.395 --> 00:27:02.052
Firebase SDKs.  You get the 
storage reference.

00:27:06.529 --> 00:27:08.351
You use the file reader, you get
from your input field, you get 

00:27:08.352 --> 00:27:14.670
the file name and the content 
and you upload that to storage. 

00:27:14.671 --> 00:27:16.671
Very straightforward that we use
as well for our app.

00:27:19.564 --> 00:27:22.640
And next last but not least for 
storage is how to read a file.  

00:27:22.641 --> 00:27:25.293
It is very straightforward you 
can do a copy like down load it.

00:27:27.357 --> 00:27:29.357
You can use Java object and read
it from your packet.

00:27:32.085 --> 00:27:34.085
Or on the web you get a download
URL 

00:27:36.589 --> 00:27:38.852
and you use thr download URL and
put it in, for instance, your 

00:27:38.853 --> 00:27:44.797
image tech or background CSS.  
All right.  So that's great.  We

00:27:44.798 --> 00:27:46.798
uploaded all of our pictures.  
Or we uploaded one picture.

00:27:50.096 --> 00:27:52.096
Now how can I do processing?

00:27:54.803 --> 00:27:56.668
If I upload a picture from my 
phone or camera, these pictures 

00:27:56.669 --> 00:27:58.893
are large.  I don't want to 
serve megabytes of 

00:28:02.426 --> 00:28:04.263
pictures to my Web page or to my
users.  That would strain the 

00:28:04.264 --> 00:28:06.541
bandwidth a lot.  So what I want
to do is I want to 

00:28:10.967 --> 00:28:13.258
create some thumbnails.  Now 
there is a possibility that you 

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:17.890
create thumbnails on your 
clients.

00:28:21.002 --> 00:28:24.055
There are many reasons for not 
doing this.  I could trigger the

00:28:24.056 --> 00:28:26.716
creation from my clients.  I 
don't think that is a good idea 

00:28:26.924 --> 00:28:28.924
either.  What happens if you 
upload a picture 

00:28:32.255 --> 00:28:35.010
and then you get disconnected or
the thumbnail creation fails and

00:28:35.011 --> 00:28:37.870
you need to retry it.  All this 
logic would be cluttering 

00:28:41.188 --> 00:28:43.398
your Frontend and your client 
code.  You want to do these 

00:28:43.399 --> 00:28:44.599
things in the Backend.  So I 
want to use a different 

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:50.734
mechanism to triggering the 
processing of my image files.  

00:28:50.735 --> 00:28:52.735
And that's where object 
notifications come in.

00:28:54.619 --> 00:28:56.619
So object notifications on 
Google 

00:28:58.051 --> 00:29:00.051
cloud storage allows you to 
register a hook which 

00:29:02.969 --> 00:29:08.176
gets called if anything happens 
on your storage system.  There 

00:29:08.177 --> 00:29:12.888
are four event types that you 
can hook your systems up.  

00:29:12.889 --> 00:29:14.889
Object create.

00:29:16.969 --> 00:29:18.969
Object delete and archiving and 
any 

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:23.161
kind of metadata update you do 
on your objects.  There are 

00:29:23.162 --> 00:29:25.162
different mechanisms to hook 

00:29:26.223 --> 00:29:30.512
in to these events.  On one hand
if you use Firebase and cloud 

00:29:30.513 --> 00:29:31.737
functions you can use cloud 
storage trigger for cloud 

00:29:31.738 --> 00:29:37.502
functions.  So basically if you 
submit your function you can say

00:29:37.503 --> 00:29:41.372
this functions get triggered if 
anything happens on my bucket.  

00:29:41.373 --> 00:29:44.253
This is actually a int greated 
with the 

00:29:48.689 --> 00:29:50.689
Pub/Sub notification.

00:29:51.704 --> 00:29:53.704
Pub/Sub notification allows you 
to set 

00:29:55.895 --> 00:29:57.324
notification watch command on 
your bucket and say if anything 

00:29:57.325 --> 00:30:00.990
happens of these events that I 
declare please send me a Pub/Sub

00:30:00.991 --> 00:30:02.991
message and then you can have a 
system that deals with the 

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:05.450
Pub/Sub message.  

00:30:07.508 --> 00:30:08.534
And kind of the legacy object 
change notifications that are 

00:30:08.535 --> 00:30:11.397
still around as to what we 
introduce very early on in 

00:30:15.868 --> 00:30:16.891
the Google cloud storage object 
is the object change 

00:30:16.892 --> 00:30:18.892
notifications.

00:30:24.161 --> 00:30:24.692
You are basically get an HDPS 
and then you can deal with the 

00:30:24.693 --> 00:30:26.939
message there as well.  The nice
thing about this is all what 

00:30:30.648 --> 00:30:32.488
you are using here if you set 
this up is integrated in a way 

00:30:32.489 --> 00:30:34.738
it does all the retry.  If you 
don't acknowledge a successful 

00:30:37.404 --> 00:30:40.049
processing of the message, the 
system just retries it 

00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:42.050
automatically up to 30 days.  
All right.

00:30:44.946 --> 00:30:46.946
So how do I set up Cloud Pub/Sub
trigger?  Here is an example.

00:30:52.128 --> 00:30:54.128
I am using the G cloud SDK or 
CLI.

00:30:56.613 --> 00:30:58.613
I do G Cloud Pub/Sub and player 
and 

00:31:01.062 --> 00:31:05.351
notification and I create here a
notification against my cloudy 

00:31:05.352 --> 00:31:07.352
pictures bucket and I say I 

00:31:10.227 --> 00:31:12.055
only want to have noteifications
when object finalize is created 

00:31:12.056 --> 00:31:16.160
and I declare the topic where 
this notification is going to be

00:31:16.161 --> 00:31:18.227
sent to and then if I want to 
have a system that receives this

00:31:21.077 --> 00:31:23.077
messages I create a so-called 
subscription.

00:31:25.548 --> 00:31:28.219
Here G Cloud Pub/Sub 
subscription and notice up which

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:30.251
hooks to the topic that I just 
created.  

00:31:30.671 --> 00:31:32.671
All right.

00:31:34.142 --> 00:31:36.142
So let me show you how that 
looks like really quick.

00:31:37.595 --> 00:31:39.438
So I want to show you here, you 
see my application.  Right now 

00:31:39.439 --> 00:31:41.439
it is pretty empty.  If I 
refresh this, nothing is 

00:31:41.502 --> 00:31:45.415
happening.  So throughout this 
talk I actually want to fill 

00:31:45.416 --> 00:31:50.748
this with pictures.  So I can 
show you if I upload a picture 

00:31:50.749 --> 00:31:53.395
here I just select one picture. 
I am going to do upload.

00:31:56.644 --> 00:31:58.713
And it is going to upload but 
pretty much nothing else going 

00:31:58.714 --> 00:32:00.714
to happen.  All right?

00:32:05.723 --> 00:32:06.328
So if I am going to refresh my 
page this picture is going to be

00:32:06.329 --> 00:32:09.583
gone.  I need to implement all 
the things behind the scenes to 

00:32:09.584 --> 00:32:12.063
process this picture.  So first 
thing that we are going to do 

00:32:16.574 --> 00:32:18.009
-- I show you how to create this
-- let me make that a little 

00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:21.457
bigger.  Can you see this?  
Thumbs up, thumbs down if you 

00:32:21.458 --> 00:32:23.458
can see that.  All right.  Cool.

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:29.160
So first thing is G Cloud 
Pub/Sub and 

00:32:31.033 --> 00:32:33.687
then I say create and let's say 
do notice up.  That's one.  

00:32:34.739 --> 00:32:36.739
All right.

00:32:40.214 --> 00:32:42.513
So I created my nootif poppic.

00:32:48.168 --> 00:32:50.168
The things I want to do create 
my watch command.

00:32:53.199 --> 00:32:54.231
So now if you have spotted I 
actually named the topic 

00:32:54.232 --> 00:32:59.318
differently.  So I'm going to 
remove this here.  And create 

00:32:59.319 --> 00:33:01.392
this notification.  So now what 
is going to happen is 

00:33:05.671 --> 00:33:06.881
actually I'm creating an n 
notification watch on my storage

00:33:06.882 --> 00:33:08.882
bucket.

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:10.983
You see here the storage is 
named a little different because

00:33:10.984 --> 00:33:15.657
that's the storage I use for my 
application.  The next thing 

00:33:15.658 --> 00:33:17.658
that I want to do is I 

00:33:19.534 --> 00:33:21.534
actually want to see if any 
messages are coming in.

00:33:25.248 --> 00:33:27.248
So I can do a notification 
Pub/Sub.  Oops.  

00:33:29.179 --> 00:33:31.426
Sorry.  Pub/Sub.

00:33:34.621 --> 00:33:36.621
Notification

00:33:41.856 --> 00:33:46.178
.  Sorry.  All right.  So 
subscription.  I just created a 

00:33:46.179 --> 00:33:50.034
subscription.  I actually need 
to create a subscription.  I 

00:33:50.035 --> 00:33:52.035
haven't done that.  I want to 
create a subscription which 

00:33:54.931 --> 00:33:58.009
I call uploads.  Create a 
subscription.  So now I have a 

00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:02.259
subscription that actually 
listens on that topic.  This is 

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:07.156
a little slow.  So let me turn 
off the WiFi and hope that it 

00:34:07.157 --> 00:34:09.157
works a little bit better 
without the WiFi.

00:34:11.016 --> 00:34:13.077
So I want to listen to my 
Pub/Sub topic.  So I am going to

00:34:13.078 --> 00:34:15.078
do Pub/Sub 

00:34:16.091 --> 00:34:18.091
subscription

00:34:20.783 --> 00:34:22.783
and then I can pull and I am 
going to 

00:34:23.839 --> 00:34:25.690
pull -- I'm not going to 
acknowledge but I am going to 

00:34:25.691 --> 00:34:28.966
pull uploads.  All right.  So as
you can see right now there is 

00:34:32.425 --> 00:34:34.425
not -- nothing going to happen.

00:34:36.306 --> 00:34:38.554
So let me upload a picture and 
pick again.  Upload that 

00:34:38.555 --> 00:34:40.555
picture.

00:34:42.215 --> 00:34:44.215
And then going to go back to my 
system to pull uploads.

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:49.598
As you can see here I have a 
message.  In this message as you

00:34:49.599 --> 00:34:51.599
can see has a lot of things.  
There are things like the I.D.

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:56.955
, self-link for it, name of the 
bucket, generation I.D., all 

00:34:56.956 --> 00:35:02.238
these things that you can use.  
All right.  So next thing, let's

00:35:02.239 --> 00:35:04.239
go back to the 

00:35:05.246 --> 00:35:07.246
slides

00:35:08.578 --> 00:35:10.578
.  So I have my bucket.

00:35:13.081 --> 00:35:14.906
So now if I upload my pictures 
and processing them, I want to 

00:35:14.907 --> 00:35:18.454
actually store some data around 
this.  So even if I now process 

00:35:18.455 --> 00:35:19.878
my pictures I am going -- 
nothing is going to happen 

00:35:19.879 --> 00:35:23.966
basically.  They are not going 
to be displayed in my Web page. 

00:35:23.967 --> 00:35:26.415
So I need something to actually 
process them and store some 

00:35:26.416 --> 00:35:29.111
metadata around them.  So that's
where we go back and look at 

00:35:31.148 --> 00:35:32.171
like what is the portfolio of 
systems that we have available 

00:35:32.172 --> 00:35:34.172
for us.

00:35:35.644 --> 00:35:37.644
And here I am going to look at 
fire store.

00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:43.006
Fire store is NoSQL Backend 
system.

00:35:46.692 --> 00:35:48.733
And the advantage of that, 
that's very flexible.  If you 

00:35:48.734 --> 00:35:50.573
wand to add some fields or 
things like you can do that 

00:35:50.574 --> 00:35:54.061
throughout the life cycle of the
application.  So you don't have 

00:35:54.062 --> 00:35:56.311
to be very restrictive on the 
schema that you are going to 

00:35:56.312 --> 00:35:59.977
use.  You can just evolve the 
schema while you develop your 

00:35:59.978 --> 00:36:01.978
application.  

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:07.260
Now for fire store again there 
are 

00:36:10.638 --> 00:36:13.133
online libraries that you can 
use from the web.  Cloud fire 

00:36:13.134 --> 00:36:15.815
store, it is very flexible.  You
have an expressive creative 

00:36:16.796 --> 00:36:19.035
language.  You get realtime 
updates if you 

00:36:22.861 --> 00:36:25.219
Firebases and you can use watch 
or get any unts for data that 

00:36:25.421 --> 00:36:27.421
has changed.

00:36:28.485 --> 00:36:31.759
If you offline support and it is
designed to scale again.  This 

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:35.695
is a system that can scale 
through massive sizes.  So how 

00:36:35.696 --> 00:36:40.027
do you write data to fire store?
Here is an example for Java.  So

00:36:40.028 --> 00:36:42.028
pretty much everything in fire 

00:36:43.486 --> 00:36:45.486
store is async.

00:36:47.501 --> 00:36:51.405
You get a do you mean r document
ref and you give it a name.  You

00:36:51.406 --> 00:36:53.406
have a connection document and 

00:36:54.479 --> 00:36:56.479
then you put your fields in 
there.

00:36:59.396 --> 00:37:01.647
You use an API future and you 
can update fields.  If you read 

00:37:01.648 --> 00:37:03.285
data it is pretty much similar 
to that.  There are not a lot of

00:37:03.286 --> 00:37:05.286
changes here.

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:11.446
You just do on the document ref 
that you create and you that 

00:37:11.447 --> 00:37:13.447
block still has the data.

00:37:15.732 --> 00:37:16.350
See how we can int great that to
write some data in our 

00:37:16.351 --> 00:37:20.873
application.  
So now we are going to switch to

00:37:20.874 --> 00:37:22.874
our -- to some code.

00:37:24.961 --> 00:37:26.961
What I have here is my image 

00:37:30.432 --> 00:37:32.432
processioncess ing service.

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:36.230
I set up my application.

00:37:38.557 --> 00:37:41.216
If you run that on a GC 
instance, then you have a 

00:37:41.217 --> 00:37:45.056
default context or you provide a
service account which is used to

00:37:45.057 --> 00:37:47.902
authenticate you.  You really 
need only these like six 

00:37:52.831 --> 00:37:54.831
lines to get the storage -- to 
get the credential context.

00:37:56.708 --> 00:37:59.026
We need a project I.D. and we 
defin our storage that we want 

00:38:00.526 --> 00:38:02.789
to use.  This is again cloud 
storage for Firebase.

00:38:06.273 --> 00:38:08.273
I define here my Pub/Sub that I 
have defined.

00:38:11.368 --> 00:38:13.368
And I can actually use this and 
say 

00:38:14.424 --> 00:38:16.278
okay I created a Pub/Sub that's 
uploads.  I am going to use the 

00:38:16.279 --> 00:38:20.374
upload subscription that I 
created earlier.  And then this 

00:38:20.375 --> 00:38:22.375
code what you see here 

00:38:24.444 --> 00:38:26.444
is basically listening for 
Pub/Sub 

00:38:28.456 --> 00:38:32.478
messages.  So this is again 
doing this asynchronously.  

00:38:32.479 --> 00:38:34.479
Every time I get a message I 
have here my message that I get.

00:38:35.236 --> 00:38:37.236
I am going to put that in to my 

00:38:38.352 --> 00:38:39.974
process message function that we
are going to look in to in a 

00:38:39.975 --> 00:38:42.822
bit.  If the function is 
successful I acknowledge this 

00:38:42.823 --> 00:38:44.823
message.

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:48.090
Now what you have with Pub/Sub 
is if 

00:38:49.593 --> 00:38:50.854
you can actually have multiple 
subscribers on the same 

00:38:50.855 --> 00:38:52.855
subscription.

00:38:54.349 --> 00:38:56.349
And what happens your message 
get 

00:38:59.433 --> 00:39:00.438
round robined distributed to all
the subscribers of if you want 

00:39:00.439 --> 00:39:02.483
to be sure that one message is 
distributed to 

00:39:05.552 --> 00:39:07.830
multiple places then you just 
create multiple subscriptions.  

00:39:07.831 --> 00:39:10.075
All right.  So let's look in it 
our process message.  

00:39:12.127 --> 00:39:13.991
So what we are going to do here 
is basically I am going to check

00:39:13.992 --> 00:39:20.311
for uploads on my image.  And it
gets uploaded and I connect -- I

00:39:20.312 --> 00:39:21.312
am going to show you really 
quick, we have here our storage 

00:39:21.313 --> 00:39:23.313
system.

00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:27.450
If I go to storage, you are 
going to see here I have some 

00:39:27.451 --> 00:39:29.904
images.  That are the two images
that I uploaded earlier.

00:39:34.604 --> 00:39:36.604
So let me -- yeah,.  All right.

00:39:39.928 --> 00:39:41.143
And then I basically take the 
user I.D. out of this and the 

00:39:41.144 --> 00:39:43.995
file I.D. out of it.  And do 
some resizing and I am doing 

00:39:48.714 --> 00:39:50.714
the resizesize ing here with the
image metric.

00:39:53.418 --> 00:39:55.418
I store the sums in my bucket as
you can see here.

00:39:58.961 --> 00:40:00.961
I have like 600 pixel wide 
thumbnail 

00:40:02.024 --> 00:40:04.024
and 1,000 six wide thumbnail and
I just 

00:40:05.695 --> 00:40:07.321
create and move this object as 
well to a different folder, it 

00:40:07.322 --> 00:40:09.322
is not in my uploads folder 
anymore.  

00:40:12.644 --> 00:40:14.681
And last but not least I just 
clean up all my temporary files 

00:40:14.682 --> 00:40:16.916
that I had in between.  Now as 
you can see I just started that.

00:40:18.949 --> 00:40:20.949
So let's see what's going to 
happen.

00:40:22.072 --> 00:40:24.072
Since we uploaded some pictures 

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:29.420
earlier on this subscription it 
should actually get these.

00:40:31.285 --> 00:40:33.519
As you can see now it actually 
gets these messages and does all

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:36.628
the processing.  So let's have a
look how that looks like.

00:40:39.684 --> 00:40:42.521
So we see here that we have our 
messages.  You can say on my 

00:40:42.522 --> 00:40:46.411
storage.  You can see if 
anything is happening.  Okay.  

00:40:46.412 --> 00:40:49.491
We have actually uploads and raw
images now.  So we have images 

00:40:49.492 --> 00:40:51.492
moving.  Great.  Amazing.

00:40:55.699 --> 00:40:58.326
And then let's see if any 
metadata is coming in.  Metadata

00:40:58.327 --> 00:41:02.209
is not coming in.  All right.  
So let's just upload another 

00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:04.210
picture and see if our metadata 
is coming in.

00:41:08.789 --> 00:41:10.789
Actually I'm not writing any 
metadata.

00:41:12.078 --> 00:41:14.078
So actually need to write my 
metadata first.

00:41:15.165 --> 00:41:17.618
So we need to look in to setting
this up for writing some 

00:41:17.619 --> 00:41:22.331
metadata.  So the first thing is
I want to have my fire store.  

00:41:22.332 --> 00:41:24.332
So fire store in it.

00:41:26.633 --> 00:41:28.633
So this creates, takes the 
credentials 

00:41:31.531 --> 00:41:33.531
again and initializes my 
Firebase app in 

00:41:35.426 --> 00:41:38.123
my fire store and before I move 
my data to the raw folder, let's

00:41:38.124 --> 00:41:40.124
do it after that.

00:41:44.231 --> 00:41:46.231
I want to update my fire store 
metadata.

00:41:49.124 --> 00:41:50.754
So here I'm just going to add 
three fields, process fields 

00:41:50.755 --> 00:41:53.004
around large available field and
sum field.

00:41:56.697 --> 00:41:58.697
I am going to save this and 
restart my application.  

00:41:58.966 --> 00:42:03.060
Something is missing.  All 
right.  Firebase is not there.  

00:42:03.061 --> 00:42:05.061
Fire store, all right.  Of 
course.

00:42:06.536 --> 00:42:12.021
We need actually to provide this
here.  So fire store.  And then 

00:42:12.022 --> 00:42:16.148
here I want to provide my fire 
store.  All right.  

00:42:16.764 --> 00:42:22.056
Try this again.  All right.  So 
now it is working.  So let's 

00:42:22.057 --> 00:42:25.744
have a look if we upload a 
picture.  Okay.

00:42:29.768 --> 00:42:31.768
We upload a picture

00:42:36.381 --> 00:42:37.197
.  So this is actually just a 
client side that I display this 

00:42:37.198 --> 00:42:40.344
picture.  So if I refresh I am 
going to see nothing.  That's 

00:42:40.345 --> 00:42:42.345
okay.  I am going to see nothing
because it 

00:42:44.823 --> 00:42:46.857
is basically downloading the 
file, doing the image metric and

00:42:46.858 --> 00:42:48.858
then uploading the file again.

00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:52.510
So that will take a little 
while.

00:42:54.610 --> 00:42:56.610
So you see a new element coming 
in.

00:42:58.101 --> 00:43:00.101
Let's see if we get all the 
stuff.

00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:05.255
All right.  Okay.  Perfect.  So 
we have now the metadata there 

00:43:09.995 --> 00:43:11.208
which means our picture was 
processed and first success.  

00:43:11.209 --> 00:43:13.209
Awesome.  So we have the first 
picture there.

00:43:17.949 --> 00:43:19.949
Let's switch back to the slides.
All right.

00:43:22.904 --> 00:43:25.380
So we have our first minimal 
viable product.  So we can 

00:43:25.381 --> 00:43:28.220
upload picture and I can display
pictures and I can store some 

00:43:29.253 --> 00:43:33.116
metadata as well on it.  So now 
what if our app grows?  Like a 

00:43:33.117 --> 00:43:35.117
lot of people, thousands of 

00:43:38.472 --> 00:43:41.510
people are starting to upload 
cloudyy pictures.  This is a 

00:43:41.511 --> 00:43:44.782
very targeted app, only for 
cloudy pictures.  I want to 

00:43:44.783 --> 00:43:47.677
reduce some cost.  In the 
beginning you saw I created a 

00:43:50.539 --> 00:43:52.539
bucket which is a multi regional
bucket.

00:43:54.399 --> 00:43:56.242
It is actually our like most 
sophisticated storage class we 

00:43:56.243 --> 00:43:58.243
have.  To reduce cost I have a 
different 

00:44:01.745 --> 00:44:03.810
option in storage classes that I
can use.  There are four storage

00:44:03.811 --> 00:44:06.896
classes available under the 
cloud storage.  The multi 

00:44:06.897 --> 00:44:08.897
regional one is the one that 

00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:12.990
is distributed across two 
regions which 

00:44:14.089 --> 00:44:16.746
are at least 100 miles apart 
from each other and gives you 

00:44:16.747 --> 00:44:20.776
the highest availability for 
your needs.  If you do data 

00:44:20.777 --> 00:44:22.602
processing and you want to 
process your data close to where

00:44:22.603 --> 00:44:24.603
this 

00:44:26.081 --> 00:44:28.322
living, then we recommend to use
a regional bucket.  A regional 

00:44:28.323 --> 00:44:30.323
bucket is one region.

00:44:31.403 --> 00:44:34.059
It is a little bit cheaper and 
gives you a little bit less 

00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:37.566
availability as well.  
Now when it comes to archiving 

00:44:37.567 --> 00:44:42.958
data we have a new line and cold
line storage class.  Real line 

00:44:42.959 --> 00:44:45.413
is pretty much if you are images
are any kind of objects or they 

00:44:48.688 --> 00:44:51.366
are not used within 30 days you 
can move them to near line and 

00:44:51.367 --> 00:44:55.018
it is cheaper to use near line 
than have them stored on a multi

00:44:55.019 --> 00:44:57.695
regional or regional bucket.  If
you use the less than once a 

00:44:57.696 --> 00:45:00.152
year, then it is recommended to 
move these to cold line.

00:45:03.867 --> 00:45:05.966
We still have the same like 
persistentsy of your data 

00:45:05.967 --> 00:45:07.967
objects.

00:45:11.491 --> 00:45:13.328
And you still have the same APIs
which is amazing the but the 

00:45:13.329 --> 00:45:16.600
prices get down.  One thing that
is important to do all these 

00:45:16.601 --> 00:45:18.826
things automated or in your 
application, is something called

00:45:18.827 --> 00:45:20.827
object life cycle.

00:45:23.263 --> 00:45:25.263
With object life cycle what you 
can do 

00:45:28.225 --> 00:45:32.158
is define rules when object get 
automatically transitioned 

00:45:28.225 --> 00:45:30.876
between the storage classes.  So
on my bucket I could define a 

00:45:30.877 --> 00:45:34.386
rule, if an object is older than
30 days please move to new line.

00:45:37.499 --> 00:45:39.499
If it is older than like 365 
days or 

00:45:40.556 --> 00:45:42.556
older than 90 days please move 
it to cold line.  

00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:46.697
But I also can do that per 
object.  I don't have to create 

00:45:46.698 --> 00:45:50.404
a bucket with a specific storage
class.  You can do that but you 

00:45:50.405 --> 00:45:54.095
don't have to.  You can change 
the store class per object.  So 

00:45:54.096 --> 00:45:56.096
how does it look like?

00:45:59.798 --> 00:46:02.041
You can use it with GSU or you 
can use Java SSL to move your 

00:46:02.042 --> 00:46:04.042
object.

00:46:05.309 --> 00:46:07.132
So I am going to show that 
really quick how we are going to

00:46:07.133 --> 00:46:09.133
do this here.

00:46:11.006 --> 00:46:13.006
So I have an second application 
here 

00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:16.060
which extracts some more 
metadata.

00:46:17.534 --> 00:46:20.013
So as you can here the same like
setup code pretty much but what 

00:46:20.014 --> 00:46:22.014
I do is I'm 

00:46:23.295 --> 00:46:25.295
reading the object and then I'm 
using 

00:46:26.546 --> 00:46:29.008
the SDK to get like exit data 
out of it.  So now when this is 

00:46:29.009 --> 00:46:31.446
done what I want to do is 
actually I want to move this 

00:46:32.671 --> 00:46:36.166
object away.  
So let's see how we can do this 

00:46:36.167 --> 00:46:38.167
so we 

00:46:42.642 --> 00:46:44.642
can do like here, and then move 
the

00:46:46.917 --> 00:46:48.917
object

00:46:51.833 --> 00:46:53.833
.  See how we got to do this

00:47:01.667 --> 00:47:03.667
.  Okay.  All right.  There it 
is.

00:47:06.588 --> 00:47:08.422
So basically I take my object, I
just define a new storage class,

00:47:08.423 --> 00:47:10.423
build this 

00:47:11.885 --> 00:47:14.735
and then say look okay when my 
metadata is processed I'm going 

00:47:14.736 --> 00:47:16.755
to move it to near line.  I am 
going to start this here as well

00:47:20.069 --> 00:47:22.308
and that's going to listen on my
notification as well.  So now 

00:47:22.309 --> 00:47:24.171
this is topic where 
notifications have been sent 

00:47:24.172 --> 00:47:26.172
before.

00:47:27.477 --> 00:47:30.750
So as you can see it starts 
processing as well.  I might 

00:47:30.751 --> 00:47:35.237
throw some errors because I have
deleted some object.  But it 

00:47:35.238 --> 00:47:37.278
basically will process in the 
background our objects.  

00:47:39.327 --> 00:47:41.327
So let's have a look if that is 
actually working.

00:47:43.711 --> 00:47:46.427
So what we can have here is like
we have our objects and in time 

00:47:46.428 --> 00:47:51.539
what you can see here is 
metadata is showing up.  So this

00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:54.020
gives me all the exit data which
I now can use to search for 

00:47:57.690 --> 00:48:00.139
instance or build a roadmap 
where I can put all my pictures.

00:48:02.434 --> 00:48:05.252
If I go to storage, I'm going to
go to my storage system, going 

00:48:05.253 --> 00:48:08.120
to go to cloudy pictures.  I am 
going to do to my raws and going

00:48:10.973 --> 00:48:12.973
to see here and as you can see 
my 

00:48:14.233 --> 00:48:17.290
pictures actually now have the 
storage system near line.  So 

00:48:17.291 --> 00:48:20.160
even though I created this 
bucket as multi regional bucket 

00:48:20.161 --> 00:48:24.423
I am already moving my objects 
in to a different storage class 

00:48:24.424 --> 00:48:28.145
which is really powerful.  
Switching back.   

00:48:29.705 --> 00:48:31.716
All right.  So we have that.  We
have reduced our costs by moving

00:48:33.717 --> 00:48:35.763
our objects and saving them 
costs there.  The next thing 

00:48:35.764 --> 00:48:39.066
that I want to do is enable our 
business model.  I want to 

00:48:39.067 --> 00:48:41.067
generate some money with this.

00:48:44.982 --> 00:48:47.628
So it has gone viral and stored 
a lot of pictures and people 

00:48:47.629 --> 00:48:51.312
have asked and I want to print 
and frame.  So buy frame and 

00:48:51.313 --> 00:48:54.603
ship the pictures.  So I want to
enable this.  If I want to do 

00:48:54.604 --> 00:48:57.245
this, like I am dealing with 
money.  And if I'm dealing with 

00:48:57.246 --> 00:48:59.246
money I need 

00:49:00.535 --> 00:49:02.166
actually transactional system.  
I don't want to do this with 

00:49:02.167 --> 00:49:04.167
fire 

00:49:05.378 --> 00:49:09.006
store because my guarantees with
fire store are not sufficient 

00:49:09.007 --> 00:49:11.007
for what I want to do.  That's 
where another storage system 

00:49:12.046 --> 00:49:14.046
comes in and we have managed 
storage system for cloud SQL.

00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:20.700
So cloud SQL is a managed auto 
BMS 

00:49:23.894 --> 00:49:28.742
system where you can have MySQL 
or postgre SQL.  You can do fail

00:49:28.743 --> 00:49:30.743
yovrs in to other people clouds.

00:49:34.315 --> 00:49:36.754
You can do failovers on to 
premise systems.  So you can 

00:49:36.755 --> 00:49:38.807
change your note size through 
our life cycle of your 

00:49:39.429 --> 00:49:41.429
application.  And you have 
things like 99.

00:49:44.522 --> 00:49:47.397
95 SLA.  How I do create a MySQL
instance?

00:49:50.521 --> 00:49:54.379
Very straightforward.  You give 
it a name and you save it here 

00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:56.380
which is the size that you want 
to 

00:49:58.041 --> 00:50:00.695
use and the region where cloud 
SQL is created.  Next thing I 

00:50:00.696 --> 00:50:03.138
want to talk to my cloud SQL, 
MySQL instance.

00:50:08.072 --> 00:50:10.510
So what we provide is actually a
proxy which automatically 

00:50:10.511 --> 00:50:12.511
authenticates you if 

00:50:13.928 --> 00:50:18.140
you employ a service if you 
provide a service file.  You 

00:50:18.141 --> 00:50:20.141
download and make it executable 

00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:23.650
and you can run it locally or on
your 

00:50:25.741 --> 00:50:27.741
GSE instance or if you are 
familiar with 

00:50:29.824 --> 00:50:32.467
Google netu you can run it in 
your port SSI card to connect to

00:50:32.468 --> 00:50:34.468
your cloud instance.

00:50:36.343 --> 00:50:38.618
That's pretty much 
straightforward.  Who here has 

00:50:38.619 --> 00:50:40.884
done something with MySQL or any
SQL database?  All right.  

00:50:40.885 --> 00:50:45.151
Amazing.  So this looks very 
familiar.  

00:50:47.434 --> 00:50:49.434
Relational schema I am creating 
a database and some tables.

00:50:52.513 --> 00:50:54.513
In this case am creating user 
table, 

00:50:57.703 --> 00:50:58.829
the cloud officiado and I am 
creating a cloud and I am 

00:50:58.830 --> 00:51:01.684
creating a transaction table 
which shows me the history of 

00:51:01.685 --> 00:51:03.685
the transactions that have been 
done.  

00:51:05.775 --> 00:51:07.775
And then I can do things like 

00:51:09.641 --> 00:51:12.074
distributed or not a distributed
but a transaction that goes 

00:51:12.075 --> 00:51:14.158
across multiple taiblts.  I have
a transaction that takes some 

00:51:15.998 --> 00:51:17.492
money from the balanced table 
and puts it somewhere else in 

00:51:17.493 --> 00:51:20.544
the balance table and writes in 
my transaction table that this 

00:51:20.545 --> 00:51:22.545
has been happened.

00:51:25.024 --> 00:51:27.024
So it is pretty much 
straightfooforward.

00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:31.150
Now the next table my app goes 
viral.

00:51:33.048 --> 00:51:34.275
So now what we want to do we 
want to need a scalability 

00:51:34.276 --> 00:51:36.276
check.

00:51:37.930 --> 00:51:39.930
So when I brought my cloudy 
pictures 3.

00:51:43.679 --> 00:51:46.725
0 I want it to be rescalible for
a large amount of people.  Cloud

00:51:46.726 --> 00:51:48.726
storage is scaleable.

00:51:49.787 --> 00:51:52.028
Cloud fire store or fire store 
on a Firebase is also scaleable.

00:51:54.114 --> 00:51:56.748
It is multi service.  You don't 
have to reprovision any 

00:51:56.952 --> 00:52:00.852
resources.  You use it, with 
your application and the more 

00:52:00.853 --> 00:52:04.327
you use it will scale with your 
needs.  Amazing.  Now cloud SQL 

00:52:04.328 --> 00:52:06.164
unfortunately is one solution 
that doesn't scale with your 

00:52:06.165 --> 00:52:09.016
needs.  You can scale it up to a
certain point.

00:52:12.709 --> 00:52:14.709
Basically the biggest 3M that 
your 

00:52:17.904 --> 00:52:19.904
cloud provider orOregon in our 
case the 

00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:22.817
cloud provides, if you run out 
of size you are stuck.  There 

00:52:22.818 --> 00:52:24.818
many things that you can do.

00:52:26.948 --> 00:52:29.789
You can do charting and build 
like distributed.  But it is 

00:52:29.790 --> 00:52:32.036
very challenging and costs a lot
of time and investment and it is

00:52:33.053 --> 00:52:35.053
very risky.  

00:52:37.347 --> 00:52:39.347
So let's now -- I want to block 
in cloud spanner.

00:52:42.285 --> 00:52:44.285
Cloud spanner is our 
horizontally 

00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:47.823
scaleable and distributed 
relational database system.  It 

00:52:47.824 --> 00:52:50.077
scales with your needs.  You can
scale to thousands of nodes 

00:52:53.173 --> 00:52:55.445
and it scales horizontally your 
schema permitting.  If you want 

00:52:55.446 --> 00:52:57.941
to learn a little bit more about
cloud spanner there is a 

00:52:57.942 --> 00:52:59.942
shameless plug at the bottom.

00:53:03.242 --> 00:53:05.242
So if you search for TIL about 
cloud 

00:53:08.772 --> 00:53:10.414
spanner you will find the video 
series where I go through the 

00:53:10.415 --> 00:53:12.415
amazing things that we do with 
cloud spanner.  

00:53:14.144 --> 00:53:16.144
So let's recap.

00:53:17.451 --> 00:53:19.451
What are the portfolio on Google
cloud 

00:53:20.706 --> 00:53:23.584
storage or Google Cloud Platform
that we have in terms of data 

00:53:23.585 --> 00:53:25.585
cloud storage.

00:53:26.690 --> 00:53:29.130
We have covered cloud SQL and 
mentioned cloud spanner and 

00:53:29.131 --> 00:53:31.131
mentioned cloud data and fire 
store and there are 

00:53:35.248 --> 00:53:37.248
a couple others here on the 
slide.

00:53:40.155 --> 00:53:42.155
So if you use app en engine you 
can 

00:53:45.294 --> 00:53:47.294
use app scale -- read and write 

00:53:48.372 --> 00:53:50.372
throughput, for nonrelational 
data, then 

00:53:52.458 --> 00:53:54.728
we recommend you to use cloud 
big table.  It has an H based 

00:53:54.729 --> 00:53:59.244
interface and you can connect it
to spark or things like that.  

00:53:59.245 --> 00:54:00.862
Then we also have a data 
warehouse system, managed data 

00:54:00.863 --> 00:54:03.304
warehouse system which is 
BigQuery where you can go and 

00:54:06.797 --> 00:54:08.797
load relational data in and 
crunch 

00:54:10.415 --> 00:54:12.415
terabytes of data with cloud.

00:54:15.428 --> 00:54:17.428
So with this I thank you very 
much for your attention.

00:54:19.511 --> 00:54:20.517
If you have any questions, 
please feel free to walk up to 

00:54:20.518 --> 00:54:23.359
the microphones.  I am happy to 
answer some of your questions.

00:54:26.408 --> 00:54:28.408
And please also if you want to, 
follow 

00:54:29.825 --> 00:54:34.609
me on Twitter under at host 
rosty.  I am happy to answer any

00:54:34.610 --> 00:54:37.486
questions on Twitter, too.  
Thank you.

00:54:41.973 --> 00:54:43.973
And I hope you enjoyed the talk.

00:54:47.269 --> 00:54:51.352
And have a good Google I/O.  Any
questions?  All right.  Thank 

00:54:51.353 --> 00:54:53.353
you very much.

00:55:03.378 --> 00:55:05.695
&gt;&gt;. 
   &gt;&gt;. 

00:55:05.897 --> 00:55:06.308
&gt;&gt;. 
   &gt;&gt;. 

00:55:06.309 --> 00:55:06.520
&gt;&gt;. 
   &gt;&gt;. 

00:55:06.521 --> 00:55:06.718
&gt;&gt;. 
   &gt;&gt;. 

00:55:06.719 --> 00:55:08.719
&gt;&gt;. 
   &gt;&gt;. 

00:55:09.935 --> 00:55:11.935
&gt;&gt;

00:55:13.018 --> 00:55:15.690
Thank you for joining this 
session.  Random ambassador will

00:55:15.691 --> 00:55:17.691
assist with directing you 
through the designated exits.

00:55:21.024 --> 00:55:21.648
We will be making room for those
who registered for the next 

00:55:21.649 --> 00:55:23.649
session.

00:55:24.927 --> 00:55:26.927
If you registered for the next 
session 

00:55:28.611 --> 00:55:31.490
in this room we ask you to clear
the room and return via the 

00:55:31.491 --> 00:55:34.135
registration line outside.  
Thank you.     

00:55:34.344 --> 00:55:34.767
&gt;&gt;. 
   &gt;&gt;. 

00:55:34.768 --> 00:55:35.161
&gt;&gt;. 
   &gt;&gt;. 

00:55:35.162 --> 00:55:35.396
&gt;&gt;. 
   &gt;&gt;. 

00:55:35.397 --> 00:55:35.768
&gt;&gt;. 
   &gt;&gt;. 

00:55:35.769 --> 00:55:37.769
&gt;&gt;. 
   &gt;&gt;. 

00:55:38.783 --> 00:55:40.783
&gt;&gt;

00:55:48.473 --> 00:55:50.473
What's new with Android TV?

01:06:14.431 --> 01:06:16.431
&gt;&gt;

01:18:49.951 --> 01:18:52.209
   &gt;&gt; Hey everyone.  
   (Applause.) 

01:18:54.051 --> 01:18:56.051
&gt;&gt; Wow.  
   (Applause.) 

01:18:58.566 --> 01:19:00.566
&gt;&gt; Didn't do anything.

01:19:01.656 --> 01:19:03.656
Already got applause.  It is a 
pretty good start.  

01:19:04.104 --> 01:19:06.762
(Laughter). 
   &gt;&gt; I see a lot of familiar 

01:19:06.763 --> 01:19:11.901
faces.  But the stage is getting
bigger every year.  So hey my 

01:19:11.902 --> 01:19:13.902
name is Sascha Prueter.

01:19:15.423 --> 01:19:17.423
Product -- on the product team 
for Android TV.  

01:19:17.676 --> 01:19:19.676
&gt;&gt; BENJAMIN BAXTER:  I'm 
Benjamin 

01:19:21.172 --> 01:19:22.387
Baxter, developer for Android 
TV. 

01:19:22.388 --> 01:19:23.196
&gt;&gt;. 
   &gt;&gt; SASCHA PRUETER:  The 

01:19:23.197 --> 01:19:26.862
session is called what's new.  
But we also talking a little bit

01:19:26.863 --> 01:19:30.338
of what has happened in last 
year.  So thanks for joining.

01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:36.500
And yeah, let's get going.

01:19:39.379 --> 01:19:41.379
So last time most of us talked 
was 

01:19:43.067 --> 01:19:46.066
last year at Google I/O and the 
Android TV

01:19:49.476 --> 01:19:52.139
ecosystem has grown since then 
significantly.  We are very 

01:19:52.140 --> 01:19:54.140
happy with that.

01:19:55.615 --> 01:19:57.615
We have now more than a hundred 

01:19:59.076 --> 01:20:01.317
partners working with us on 
Android TV devices.  As you can 

01:20:01.318 --> 01:20:05.196
see we are doubling that so far 
every year.  And as you can see 

01:20:05.197 --> 01:20:10.339
the growth comes from a number 
of devices.  And device 

01:20:10.340 --> 01:20:15.919
categories.  We have maybe heard
that CES earlier this year a 

01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:17.920
bunch of new partners and 

01:20:20.759 --> 01:20:22.880
very different smart TV price 
categories launching Android TV 

01:20:22.881 --> 01:20:26.620
prices.  We are in a very lucky 
position that we can't list all 

01:20:26.621 --> 01:20:28.463
partners on one slide anymore.  
So if you are here, if you are 

01:20:28.464 --> 01:20:30.464
working 

01:20:33.308 --> 01:20:35.308
with us on Android

01:20:38.705 --> 01:20:40.878
TV devices and your logo is not 
here, sorry we are running out 

01:20:40.879 --> 01:20:42.960
of space.  When it comes to pay 
TV operators we 

01:20:46.012 --> 01:20:48.012
see significant growth and we 
are very happy about that.

01:20:52.267 --> 01:20:54.267
We have already around 30 
partner es

01:20:55.786 --> 01:20:57.786
partners worldwide.

01:20:59.112 --> 01:21:01.141
Shipping boxing with Android TV 
and we have more than 50 

01:21:01.142 --> 01:21:03.190
additional ones coming.  We are 
really happy and we see good 

01:21:05.401 --> 01:21:09.430
growth there.  
But it is not only about 

01:21:09.431 --> 01:21:11.768
hardware.  It is also

01:21:14.963 --> 01:21:17.222
about software and that's why I 
am happy that the TV app is 

01:21:17.223 --> 01:21:19.223
growing significantly as well.

01:21:21.712 --> 01:21:23.712
I think this is the fifth time I
have said significantly.

01:21:26.467 --> 01:21:28.467
I will stopping do that.

01:21:30.544 --> 01:21:32.544
All of you are contributing apps
and 

01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:36.020
pick up Android TV and build new
game 

01:21:37.063 --> 01:21:37.885
experiences and completely new 
stuff that we didn't think 

01:21:37.886 --> 01:21:39.886
about.

01:21:42.223 --> 01:21:44.223
When we started the teeTV play 
store 

01:21:45.295 --> 01:21:47.295
in 2014 we had 25 apps or so.

01:21:48.735 --> 01:21:50.811
Now we are approach inging 
4,000.  And the thing because 

01:21:50.812 --> 01:21:53.268
there are a lot of app 
developers here, we want to 

01:21:56.133 --> 01:21:58.133
mention because it is a little 
under the 

01:22:00.036 --> 01:22:02.073
radar, we have launched PCB on 
Android.  If you are developing 

01:22:02.074 --> 01:22:04.149
for mobile you know direct 
carrier billing around on 

01:22:04.150 --> 01:22:06.150
mobile.

01:22:07.459 --> 01:22:09.459
So if someone buys an app, if 
someone 

01:22:13.355 --> 01:22:15.401
does an inapp purchase or buys a
card in a game you can charge it

01:22:15.402 --> 01:22:17.402
to your mobile bill.

01:22:18.483 --> 01:22:20.483
If you don't have a credit card 
or 

01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:24.760
don't want to use a kredcredit 
card.

01:22:29.497 --> 01:22:33.171
The same concept has launched on
Android TV.  You can do charges 

01:22:33.172 --> 01:22:35.172
from the play store 

01:22:36.438 --> 01:22:38.879
or play ecosystem in general to 
your cable or satellite or TV 

01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:41.991
subscription bill.   

01:22:45.704 --> 01:22:47.704
But then also one of the things 
we have 

01:22:48.929 --> 01:22:51.775
started putting more emphasis on
is the Google assistant.  You 

01:22:51.776 --> 01:22:53.776
heard us briefly talking last 
year 

01:22:56.910 --> 01:22:58.743
at Google I/O about this and 
since then the ecosystem and the

01:22:58.744 --> 01:23:00.744
services that 

01:23:03.305 --> 01:23:05.305
Google assistant brings to not 
only 

01:23:06.756 --> 01:23:08.756
Android TV but in devices in 
general has grown.

01:23:12.130 --> 01:23:14.130
We see a lot of use of the 
assistant 

01:23:15.194 --> 01:23:17.194
on TV.

01:23:18.239 --> 01:23:20.239
Just interacting with Voice.  
Right?

01:23:21.588 --> 01:23:25.471
Discovering content by simply 
talking to your TV.  Having a 

01:23:25.472 --> 01:23:28.131
very natural interface, not 
having to remember what was that

01:23:28.132 --> 01:23:31.806
search phrase again.  Just 
natural.  And it is easy and it 

01:23:31.807 --> 01:23:34.537
works.  But it is not only what 
finding content.

01:23:39.221 --> 01:23:41.063
It is also about looking up 
answers to questions you might 

01:23:41.064 --> 01:23:43.064
be interested in.

01:23:44.316 --> 01:23:46.602
It might be who that actor is or
it is also control of other 

01:23:46.603 --> 01:23:48.603
devices in your house.

01:23:52.246 --> 01:23:54.738
The assistant on Android TV 
gives you all of that.  Because 

01:23:54.739 --> 01:23:56.739
we think it is so important we 

01:24:00.292 --> 01:24:01.927
are this year putting a lot of 
priority on getting the 

01:24:01.928 --> 01:24:04.785
assistant in to more countries. 
We want to make sure we do it 

01:24:04.786 --> 01:24:08.878
right.  So we don't want to rush
anything.  But since we have 

01:24:08.879 --> 01:24:10.879
launched in the U.S.

01:24:12.784 --> 01:24:14.784
in late 2017 we are running this
year 

01:24:16.292 --> 01:24:18.292
as you can see a lot more 
countries in 

01:24:19.971 --> 01:24:21.807
to the assistant ecosystem on 
Android TV.  But even if you are

01:24:21.808 --> 01:24:25.703
in a country or a language that 
is not yet assistant enabled and

01:24:25.704 --> 01:24:27.966
you have to wait a little bit, 
we refresh our Voice search 

01:24:29.595 --> 01:24:31.595
experience even in those 
countries.

01:24:32.684 --> 01:24:34.684
So I mentioned earlier that we 
are 

01:24:37.570 --> 01:24:39.410
really happy about all the apps 
and more and more apps in the 

01:24:39.411 --> 01:24:41.411
play store.

01:24:42.688 --> 01:24:44.688
And we last year here at Google 
I/O 

01:24:47.848 --> 01:24:50.496
gave you a little sneak peek of 
the new Android TV home 

01:24:50.497 --> 01:24:54.982
experience and system UI and how
apps can integrate with that.  

01:24:54.983 --> 01:24:56.983
Back then it was a sneak peek.  
It was a preview.

01:25:00.916 --> 01:25:04.856
It has launched with and 
destroyAndroid Oreo.  We thought

01:25:04.857 --> 01:25:06.857
it was a good opportunity 

01:25:08.718 --> 01:25:10.135
to go in to more detail how your
apps can take advantage of this 

01:25:10.136 --> 01:25:12.136
content first 

01:25:14.235 --> 01:25:16.235
experience that we are trying 
toeing to 

01:25:17.296 --> 01:25:19.109
achieve with Android TV and Ben 
is going to talk about what it 

01:25:19.110 --> 01:25:21.947
means to a content first app.  
   &gt;&gt; BENJAMIN BAXTER:  Thanks.

01:25:26.798 --> 01:25:29.121
So we wanted to redefine this 
experience.  If you are familiar

01:25:29.122 --> 01:25:33.005
with the previous screen we have
one row for recommendations, a 

01:25:33.006 --> 01:25:36.080
double row for apps and double 
row for games.  We have changed 

01:25:36.081 --> 01:25:40.988
that as you can clearly see.  So
apps are still important.  We 

01:25:40.989 --> 01:25:42.989
have one row for apps of it is 
just your favorite apps.

01:25:45.666 --> 01:25:47.666
Your users customize your app to
this row.

01:25:49.128 --> 01:25:51.638
It is up to the use's 
discretion.  That recommendation

01:25:51.639 --> 01:25:54.926
row from Android, we have broken
it up in to several different 

01:25:54.927 --> 01:25:56.927
responsibilities.

01:25:57.989 --> 01:25:59.210
We have a Play Next row where 
you can add content and we will 

01:25:59.211 --> 01:26:02.062
talk more about this later.  But
you can add content to be picked

01:26:04.513 --> 01:26:07.360
back and engage with user later.
The next thing we did was we 

01:26:07.361 --> 01:26:09.361
broke out and each app can have 
their own channel.

01:26:12.087 --> 01:26:13.917
They can have their own surface 
on the home screen.  We are 

01:26:13.918 --> 01:26:15.751
trying to push this content 
first design and ever app can 

01:26:15.752 --> 01:26:17.752
contribute to it.  

01:26:20.901 --> 01:26:22.319
As Sascha mentioned earlier with
the assistant, the assistant is 

01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:24.320
on the home screen.

01:26:25.978 --> 01:26:27.978
It is not specific to Android or
O or Android P.

01:26:30.402 --> 01:26:33.340
It is supported from on Android 
M or above.  Okay.  

01:26:34.378 --> 01:26:36.231
I keep saying content first.  It
is like my favorite phrase all 

01:26:36.232 --> 01:26:38.232
of a sudden.

01:26:40.089 --> 01:26:41.514
But let's look at some really 
good examples before we dive in 

01:26:41.515 --> 01:26:43.515
to the 

01:26:45.582 --> 01:26:49.058
technical details about what 
builds a content first design.  

01:26:49.059 --> 01:26:51.537
Here we have Google Play movies 
and you can see everything about

01:26:51.538 --> 01:26:53.538
their details.

01:26:57.074 --> 01:26:59.109
It is as if the movie detail is 
on the home screen.  This is 

01:26:59.110 --> 01:27:02.402
great for users.  They don't 
have to go in to the app and hop

01:27:02.403 --> 01:27:04.834
back out.  They can make 
decisions right there from the 

01:27:04.835 --> 01:27:06.835
home screen.

01:27:08.296 --> 01:27:11.137
If we take it a step further we 
have video previews of if you 

01:27:11.138 --> 01:27:13.138
have a movie, a 

01:27:14.209 --> 01:27:16.856
trailer makes a great video 
preview.  10 second is a great 

01:27:16.857 --> 01:27:18.857
audio preview.

01:27:20.723 --> 01:27:22.355
We found that having previews is
very engaging for users and 

01:27:22.356 --> 01:27:24.822
drives engagement in to your 
app.  

01:27:26.252 --> 01:27:28.405
I said earlier about the Play 
Next row.  This is a great place

01:27:28.406 --> 01:27:32.945
for you to add content to bring 
users back in.  If you are 

01:27:32.946 --> 01:27:34.986
watching a long movie you add a 
little bit of extra metadata and

01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:40.926
we will make a beautiful 
progress indicatedor and users 

01:27:40.927 --> 01:27:45.253
are able to hop back in to the 
app.  And I said channels.  You 

01:27:45.254 --> 01:27:47.913
are not limited to one little 
row in the home screen.  You can

01:27:47.914 --> 01:27:49.914
have as many channels as you 
want.

01:27:50.986 --> 01:27:52.986
If we look here we have channels
like 

01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:55.305
featured, top, free, these are 
great channels that you know are

01:27:55.306 --> 01:28:00.446
going to be fresh.  These have 
indications of being updated 

01:28:00.447 --> 01:28:04.555
daily, even hourly.  
Okay.  So now we have a nice 

01:28:04.556 --> 01:28:06.556
context about what's on the home
screen.

01:28:09.067 --> 01:28:11.513
Let's dive in to how you guys 
can build this experience.  

01:28:12.546 --> 01:28:14.546
So what is a channel?

01:28:16.460 --> 01:28:19.109
A channel is just a logo, and a 
name.  That's all it is.  It is 

01:28:19.110 --> 01:28:21.378
a container for programs.  This 
is going to be where you feed 

01:28:23.835 --> 01:28:26.280
your content and customize 
everything deeper in the 

01:28:26.281 --> 01:28:30.404
programs.  
To build a channel, you have a 

01:28:30.405 --> 01:28:34.138
support library.  It just uses 
the builder pattern, 

01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:39.223
super easy and super convenient 
for you.  Everything on the home

01:28:39.224 --> 01:28:41.279
screen should be clickable.  If 
you click on a logo it should 

01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:43.280
open back in to your app.

01:28:46.805 --> 01:28:49.082
So set the app link URI.  The 
next thing that's important is 

01:28:49.083 --> 01:28:52.957
the internal provider I.D.  This
is an I.D. for your app to tell 

01:28:52.958 --> 01:28:57.048
the home screen hey, keep track 
of this.  I know what this idea 

01:28:57.049 --> 01:28:59.049
is and when I go 

01:29:00.527 --> 01:29:02.527
to query my channel later I can 

01:29:03.793 --> 01:29:05.793
synchronize my channel with what
the 

01:29:06.797 --> 01:29:13.286
home screen knows about my app. 
It uses a content provider.  For

01:29:13.287 --> 01:29:15.738
those of you that know the joys 
of content providers there can 

01:29:15.739 --> 01:29:18.403
be boilerplate code.  We have 
extracted that all in to the 

01:29:19.652 --> 01:29:21.652
support library and we make it 
easy for 

01:29:23.333 --> 01:29:24.974
you to build a content provider 
API.  Those also from a content 

01:29:24.975 --> 01:29:26.975
providers 

01:29:30.522 --> 01:29:31.332
know that URIs are kind of 
tedious and cumbersome to 

01:29:31.333 --> 01:29:35.251
manage.  The support library 
manages all of that for you.  It

01:29:35.252 --> 01:29:38.716
is a simple insert statement and
you get back a channel I.D.  

01:29:38.717 --> 01:29:40.753
Like I said earlier with the 
internal provider I.D. you can 

01:29:40.754 --> 01:29:44.650
use the channel I.D. and the 
internal provider I.D. to make 

01:29:44.651 --> 01:29:46.483
sure when you synchronize and 
update your channels later you 

01:29:46.484 --> 01:29:51.807
will have all the keys that you 
need.  Okay.  Channels like I 

01:29:51.808 --> 01:29:55.309
said are just a shelf a row.  
The programs are what really 

01:29:55.310 --> 01:29:59.605
matter.  So let's look at 
example of a program.  In this 

01:29:59.606 --> 01:30:01.606
program we have a bunch of stuff
happening.

01:30:04.285 --> 01:30:06.953
We have a thumbnail image.  We 
have a title, description and 

01:30:07.956 --> 01:30:10.209
anything else you know about 
this program can be added to the

01:30:10.210 --> 01:30:14.732
home screen.  The more metadata 
you add the richer the 

01:30:14.733 --> 01:30:17.587
experience the better the user 
engagement.  So anything that's 

01:30:17.588 --> 01:30:19.588
in your details page it is 
perfectly natural to put on a 

01:30:20.254 --> 01:30:22.254
home screen.

01:30:25.269 --> 01:30:27.257
Again (inaudible) pattern.  This
time you want to set the channel

01:30:27.258 --> 01:30:29.258
I.D. on your program.  So the 
home screen knows where to put 

01:30:30.323 --> 01:30:32.999
it on the home screen.  And if 
your program has more than one 

01:30:35.668 --> 01:30:37.525
channel it can be in make sure 
to add unique identifier, the 

01:30:37.526 --> 01:30:39.526
home screen will look at this 
identifier and say hey we 

01:30:41.461 --> 01:30:43.518
already know about this program 
and this channel and also in 

01:30:43.519 --> 01:30:45.519
this channel.

01:30:49.282 --> 01:30:51.345
We have deduping logic and has a
cleaner smoother experience.  We

01:30:51.346 --> 01:30:53.346
want to set the type.  In this 
example we set the type to 

01:30:56.706 --> 01:30:57.938
movie but the type will drive 
the metadata that's shown on the

01:30:57.939 --> 01:30:59.939
home screen.

01:31:02.418 --> 01:31:04.440
And I showed you with Red Bull 
earlier video previews.

01:31:08.183 --> 01:31:10.183
It is as simple as adding a URI.

01:31:11.851 --> 01:31:13.851
And the home screen will play 
the video for you.  

01:31:17.556 --> 01:31:20.269
It uses XO player under the 
covers.  All the supported video

01:31:20.270 --> 01:31:23.186
formats are supported for you 
out of the box.  If you are DRM 

01:31:23.187 --> 01:31:25.187
or you have a bit more. 

01:31:26.191 --> 01:31:28.191
&gt;&gt; 

01:31:31.355 --> 01:31:33.194
complex use case we support you 
where you can support your video

01:31:33.195 --> 01:31:35.195
on the surface.

01:31:36.853 --> 01:31:40.408
Come see us tomorrow at office 
hours.  Convert them to content 

01:31:40.409 --> 01:31:43.087
values and then from the content
value you will need URI.

01:31:46.817 --> 01:31:50.537
The URI is dynamic.  So use the 
support library.  

01:31:52.580 --> 01:31:55.431
After you have insert you get 
back a program I.D.  Now your 

01:31:55.432 --> 01:31:57.896
programs in the channel and you 
have a program I.D. and you have

01:31:57.897 --> 01:32:01.783
a channel I.D.  You have all the
tools for synchronizing updating

01:32:01.784 --> 01:32:03.784
and deleting 

01:32:05.303 --> 01:32:08.172
lealting later when you go to 
update your content.  I told you

01:32:08.173 --> 01:32:11.661
how to make the channel.  Just 
use the builder pattern.  Add it

01:32:11.662 --> 01:32:15.122
to the content provider.  But 
when do you make it?  When is 

01:32:15.123 --> 01:32:19.627
very important.  You put a lot 
of time trying to figure out how

01:32:19.628 --> 01:32:23.507
to get you started and so we 
ended up with a new intent.  So 

01:32:23.508 --> 01:32:26.368
there is an initialized programs
that will get triggered and this

01:32:26.369 --> 01:32:30.084
can happen before your app 
starts.  Which isn't a bad idea.

01:32:33.148 --> 01:32:35.839
Your app just gets downloaded on
to a TV or updated and all of a 

01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:39.932
sudden you have content on the 
home screen.  Great entryway for

01:32:39.933 --> 01:32:42.614
users to come in to your app.  
Listen for this initialized 

01:32:42.615 --> 01:32:45.463
programs and set up your 
channels and start your process.

01:32:47.312 --> 01:32:51.922
Okay.  The last thing we talked 
about was the goingGoogle 

01:32:51.923 --> 01:32:53.923
assistant.

01:32:55.724 --> 01:32:58.082
I think the Google assistant is 
a pretty fantastic experience.  

01:32:58.083 --> 01:33:00.116
It pushes that content first 
approach even further.  Things 

01:33:00.117 --> 01:33:02.117
you can do to integrate with 

01:33:06.222 --> 01:33:08.222
the Google assistant is to 
implement 

01:33:09.296 --> 01:33:10.924
search and support D links and 
handle play back controls.  

01:33:10.925 --> 01:33:14.039
Let's look further.  
When you perform a search with 

01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:17.938
the Google assistant the Google 
assistant keeps this content 

01:33:17.939 --> 01:33:19.939
first design.

01:33:21.845 --> 01:33:24.512
Search my favorite movie big 
Buck Bunny and you will see a 

01:33:24.513 --> 01:33:27.161
bunch of information.  The 
thumbnail , the description, the

01:33:30.835 --> 01:33:32.835
title, and if your app matches 
if it 

01:33:34.100 --> 01:33:36.100
matches on the title, duration, 
year at 

01:33:37.526 --> 01:33:39.776
the minimum with the metadata 
returned it will show up in 

01:33:43.041 --> 01:33:44.667
the list of apps that it is 
available on.  We use more 

01:33:44.668 --> 01:33:49.561
content providers.  This time 
your app is providing data to 

01:33:49.562 --> 01:33:51.562
the Google assistant.

01:33:52.839 --> 01:33:54.074
The Google assistant will pass a
URI for you to perform your 

01:33:54.075 --> 01:33:56.511
search on.  In this content 
provider you can do whatever you

01:33:56.512 --> 01:34:01.848
want.  Local database calls, 
network calls, whatever you need

01:34:01.849 --> 01:34:03.849
to do to perform your search you
can do it.

01:34:08.974 --> 01:34:10.974
This URI con tains the raw 
search string.

01:34:12.652 --> 01:34:14.652
If you say something like play 
big 

01:34:15.703 --> 01:34:17.556
buck bunny it is going to send 
you big buck bunny and realize 

01:34:17.557 --> 01:34:19.557
that that play is a command.

01:34:23.445 --> 01:34:25.445
Can b cognizant na

01:34:27.781 --> 01:34:29.226
that -- if you are familiar with
media session you don't have to 

01:34:29.227 --> 01:34:33.343
do anything of your app already 
supports it.  Let's take a 

01:34:33.344 --> 01:34:35.616
closer look.  If you want to -- 
if you want to 

01:34:38.902 --> 01:34:40.902
support the Google assistant and
do 

01:34:42.798 --> 01:34:44.798
different comanld commands while

01:34:46.282 --> 01:34:48.282
watching shows, for example, hey
Google 

01:34:54.237 --> 01:34:56.140
pause the movie, and the Google 
assistant will trigger that 

01:34:56.141 --> 01:34:58.141
through media session.

01:35:00.010 --> 01:35:02.010
You can hit the pause/play 
button on the remote.

01:35:03.491 --> 01:35:05.105
Make not the most useful feature
and it is a really cool 

01:35:05.106 --> 01:35:10.616
experience.  My favorite one is 
on seek to.  You say hey Google 

01:35:10.617 --> 01:35:12.617
fast forward five minutes and 
the Google assistant does 

01:35:15.746 --> 01:35:17.746
the math and says hey, you r 
your media session has a state.

01:35:20.269 --> 01:35:23.146
I know the current position in 
that state and you said fast 

01:35:23.147 --> 01:35:27.157
forward five minutes and that's 
306 seconds and I am going to 

01:35:27.158 --> 01:35:29.209
send the new position to your 
app.  If you are familiar with 

01:35:29.210 --> 01:35:31.210
media session 

01:35:33.730 --> 01:35:35.730
you know there is on reward and 
on fast forward.

01:35:37.253 --> 01:35:39.516
The Google assistant ignores 
those because it figures out the

01:35:39.517 --> 01:35:41.576
math of where to send the user 
to.

01:35:47.502 --> 01:35:49.502
The next is for audio apps.

01:35:50.994 --> 01:35:52.994
Google go back and play the 
previous 

01:35:54.227 --> 01:35:54.412
song you have to implement on 
skip to next or on skip to 

01:35:54.413 --> 01:35:57.912
previous.  
So to recap, what are some of 

01:35:57.913 --> 01:35:59.913
the best practices on the home 
screen?

01:36:02.408 --> 01:36:04.408
You should listen for 
initialized programs.

01:36:07.109 --> 01:36:09.109
This is the gateway for creating
your 

01:36:11.014 --> 01:36:14.518
programs and building that 
experiencen on the home screen. 

01:36:14.519 --> 01:36:16.519
When it comes to metadata you 
cannot have enough.

01:36:19.013 --> 01:36:21.013
The more metadata you add the 
richer 

01:36:22.304 --> 01:36:24.776
experience the better engagement
from users.  Keeping on that 

01:36:24.777 --> 01:36:28.462
theme of engagement, add 
previews.  It is going to really

01:36:28.463 --> 01:36:32.582
drive engagement and build a 
nice experience for users.  

01:36:32.583 --> 01:36:34.827
Keeping content fresh.  If you 
have scaled content you might 

01:36:36.083 --> 01:36:38.083
lose trust with users.  If you 
have a channel on the home 

01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:42.904
screen, and you haven't updated 
it in a year.  Once the user 

01:36:42.905 --> 01:36:44.940
watches all those programs they 
don't have too much of a reason 

01:36:44.941 --> 01:36:49.846
to go back in.  So you want to 
keep that content fresh.  And 

01:36:49.847 --> 01:36:52.266
that depends on your app.  If 
you are an app link Youtube or 

01:36:52.267 --> 01:36:57.237
hay stack and you have user 
curated content maybe update 

01:36:57.238 --> 01:36:59.238
every couple of hours.

01:37:00.761 --> 01:37:03.230
If you are an app like Google 
Play movies, update once a day 

01:37:03.231 --> 01:37:06.092
or twice a week or so.  
The goal is to keep the users 

01:37:06.093 --> 01:37:08.093
fresh, keep the content fresh so
users have 

01:37:10.994 --> 01:37:12.994
something to engage with every 
day.  

01:37:14.052 --> 01:37:15.264
And when it comes to the 
assistant the media session is 

01:37:15.265 --> 01:37:19.793
your friend.  Anything you want 
to do with Google assistant 

01:37:19.794 --> 01:37:22.684
media session is the key.  
The good news is all of this 

01:37:22.685 --> 01:37:24.685
stuff you can do today.

01:37:28.024 --> 01:37:30.081
It is live on Android O and I'm 
going to turn it back over to 

01:37:30.082 --> 01:37:33.539
Sascha to talk about things that
you guys can do in the future.  

01:37:33.540 --> 01:37:35.540
Thank you very much.  
   (Applause.

01:37:36.747 --> 01:37:41.080
) 
   &gt;&gt; SASCHA PRUETER:  Thanks, 

01:37:41.081 --> 01:37:44.728
Ben.  That's z interesting to 
see the different reactions of 

01:37:44.729 --> 01:37:46.729
the audience.

01:37:48.314 --> 01:37:50.314
Some people taking notes and 
taking 

01:37:52.186 --> 01:37:54.507
photos and discussing the code 
slides and the others going dude

01:37:54.508 --> 01:37:57.997
just launches the devices.  
What's new?  You heard this 

01:37:57.998 --> 01:38:00.057
morning already from Dave Burke 
and some others what's a new 

01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:03.480
stuff in Android P.

01:38:04.958 --> 01:38:06.958
And, of course, Android TV will 
also 

01:38:08.851 --> 01:38:10.851
get some new additions in 
Android P.

01:38:13.172 --> 01:38:15.259
So I will only highlight a few 
areas we are investing in.  One 

01:38:15.260 --> 01:38:18.142
is definitely performance.  We 
have done a lot of work in 

01:38:18.143 --> 01:38:20.849
Android P to actually make 
Android TV perform 

01:38:25.591 --> 01:38:28.893
better, faster, even on entry 
level hardware.  Even on some of

01:38:28.894 --> 01:38:30.894
the very affordable 

01:38:32.585 --> 01:38:35.038
smart TVs you might have seen or
set up boxes.  We want to make 

01:38:35.039 --> 01:38:37.039
sure that everything is zippy 
and fast and we have invested a 

01:38:38.126 --> 01:38:40.126
lot in Android P.

01:38:41.796 --> 01:38:44.573
And as a developer as some 
things to take a look at it is 

01:38:44.574 --> 01:38:46.574
think about your 

01:38:47.857 --> 01:38:49.857
app and app behavior.  Maybe 
some feature you might want to 

01:38:52.334 --> 01:38:54.334
disable or tweak on low memory 
devices.

01:38:56.197 --> 01:38:58.197
We see that's one of the most 
common 

01:38:59.245 --> 01:39:01.245
problems for some apps on entry 
level hardware.

01:39:06.262 --> 01:39:08.891
So take a look at the SLOM 
device.  And tune your app 

01:39:08.892 --> 01:39:12.590
behavior to that.  Play around a
little bit with it.  Maybe it is

01:39:12.591 --> 01:39:14.591
some tweaks to animations 

01:39:16.308 --> 01:39:18.372
or maybe on certain devices 
disable animations or take a 

01:39:18.373 --> 01:39:20.373
look at certain features.

01:39:24.345 --> 01:39:27.263
Also use the memory profiler to 
really check your app profile 

01:39:27.264 --> 01:39:29.309
it, see where it might run in to
some bottlenecks because 

01:39:32.788 --> 01:39:34.648
we see that still being some of 
the most common behaviors that 

01:39:34.649 --> 01:39:37.326
an app suddenly has a drop in 
FPS.  

01:39:39.549 --> 01:39:40.771
And also then use Android vitals
to monitor the performance of 

01:39:40.772 --> 01:39:46.932
your application.  Again you 
should see Android P on Android 

01:39:46.933 --> 01:39:48.960
TV devices perform much faster 
and much better and we will see 

01:39:48.961 --> 01:39:50.961
more devices because of the 
reduced hardware 

01:39:53.650 --> 01:39:55.650
envelope

01:39:56.771 --> 01:39:58.771
.  But we also wanted to update 
some 

01:40:00.734 --> 01:40:03.586
things for users and make it 
even easier to get to a fully 

01:40:03.587 --> 01:40:05.587
set up Android TV experience.

01:40:08.918 --> 01:40:10.534
I mean let's be honest, not 
everybody enjoys necessarily 

01:40:10.535 --> 01:40:14.396
setting up a new device.  And we
wanted to make it the whole 

01:40:18.141 --> 01:40:20.000
experience from unboxing the 
device to have everything 

01:40:20.001 --> 01:40:22.264
readily set up, be a lot easier 
faster and you don't have to 

01:40:22.265 --> 01:40:28.234
deal a lot with it.  So Android 
P the whole setup process is a 

01:40:28.235 --> 01:40:30.527
lot more streamlined.  I think 
we reduced the overall time it 

01:40:32.577 --> 01:40:34.577
takes you to go through there by
almost a third.

01:40:37.819 --> 01:40:40.526
And we also have some additional
cues in there where the phone 

01:40:40.527 --> 01:40:42.527
integration is better.  If you 
have an Android phone you will 

01:40:43.818 --> 01:40:45.818
get a setup notifications.

01:40:47.132 --> 01:40:49.167
So you can transfer accounts 
details, for example, your 

01:40:49.168 --> 01:40:51.168
Google account you can easily 
transfer that to the TV.  

01:40:53.454 --> 01:40:55.737
Also we have -- we have improved
the browser sign in for 

01:40:55.738 --> 01:40:57.738
non-Android devices.

01:41:00.425 --> 01:41:03.107
So iOS devices or maybe a 
laptop.  We improve that a lot. 

01:41:03.108 --> 01:41:05.108
It is a lot faster.  It is a lot
easier.

01:41:07.823 --> 01:41:09.877
And so we should get you set up 
a lot easier.  

01:41:11.530 --> 01:41:13.191
But that's only setting up the 
device with your account, and 

01:41:13.192 --> 01:41:15.880
making sure all those -- all the
settings work.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
What you also want on a smart TV
or an 

01:41:23.644 --> 01:41:27.134
OTT box you also want all your 
apps.  All the content.  As part

01:41:27.135 --> 01:41:28.978
of the setup process we have the
next generation of play auto 

01:41:28.979 --> 01:41:30.979
installs.

01:41:32.104 --> 01:41:34.104
And we already recommend you 
apps that 

01:41:36.204 --> 01:41:38.204
you have installed on other 
Android TV 

01:41:39.256 --> 01:41:41.256
devices or maybe on your phone 
if a 

01:41:43.331 --> 01:41:45.331
corresponding TV app exists.

01:41:46.390 --> 01:41:48.880
We suggest to you as part of the
setup flow.  Yes, I want all 

01:41:48.881 --> 01:41:53.584
these apps or maybe say I want 
only a few of them.  Just a few 

01:41:53.585 --> 01:41:55.585
clicks.  Check boxes and you say
go.

01:41:58.280 --> 01:41:58.902
And everything is being 
downloaded and installed 

01:41:58.903 --> 01:42:00.903
automatically.

01:42:01.981 --> 01:42:03.607
No more manual search in the 
play store after you have set up

01:42:03.608 --> 01:42:07.723
a new device.  
But downloading and installing 

01:42:07.724 --> 01:42:09.724
an app is 

01:42:11.788 --> 01:42:13.624
only one piece that we wanted to
ocht optimize.  What's also not 

01:42:13.625 --> 01:42:15.625
a great experience is going in 
to an app and then discovering 

01:42:16.921 --> 01:42:19.603
that you have to sign in with a 
user name and password and 

01:42:19.604 --> 01:42:22.092
having to awkwardly enter that 
with your remote control.

01:42:25.154 --> 01:42:27.154
And so that's why we introducing
also 

01:42:29.056 --> 01:42:31.493
Autofill with Google on Android 
TV.  If you ever entered your 

01:42:31.494 --> 01:42:33.494
credentials 

01:42:34.786 --> 01:42:36.227
on one of these apps on another 
Android device we are suggesting

01:42:36.228 --> 01:42:38.228
those to you.  You just say yes.

01:42:40.109 --> 01:42:43.383
And all the rog log in 
credentials are being added.  

01:42:43.384 --> 01:42:45.888
You are logging in automatically
without entering user names or 

01:42:45.889 --> 01:42:50.601
passwords.  
So that's set up.  But also one 

01:42:50.602 --> 01:42:52.644
of the things -- one of the 
areas that we saw a lot of users

01:42:54.478 --> 01:42:56.478
spend a lot of time and 
searching for 

01:42:57.537 --> 01:43:00.837
stuff and obviously not really 
enjoying it is settings.  

01:43:00.838 --> 01:43:02.838
Sometimes you need to tweak 
stuff or 

01:43:03.918 --> 01:43:06.156
you have skipped a certain setup
step when setting up your new 

01:43:06.157 --> 01:43:08.157
device or you 

01:43:09.218 --> 01:43:11.276
want to change your audio 
settings or add a different 

01:43:11.277 --> 01:43:14.321
account or something like this. 
And we have revamped settings on

01:43:17.846 --> 01:43:20.477
Android TV to be a lot more 
streamlined, a lot less 

01:43:20.478 --> 01:43:22.478
cluttered and we will 

01:43:23.745 --> 01:43:25.778
automatically suggest to you 
settings we think you are 

01:43:25.779 --> 01:43:27.779
looking for.

01:43:31.035 --> 01:43:33.035
And, for example,

01:43:34.211 --> 01:43:35.241
when you skipped account log in,
we as you seen in animation 

01:43:35.242 --> 01:43:37.242
here, we already 

01:43:39.405 --> 01:43:43.538
highlight that or when we saw 
you tweak around with some apps 

01:43:39.405 --> 01:43:41.405
and something 

01:43:43.338 --> 01:43:45.200
wasn't right and you are go in 
to setting we will highlight the

01:43:45.201 --> 01:43:49.696
app setting for you.  We want to
make it quickly get in and get 

01:43:49.697 --> 01:43:51.697
the stuff twooeked that you need
and get out again.

01:43:56.639 --> 01:43:58.639
So that was a lot about Android 
P.

01:44:01.193 --> 01:44:03.193
You can download the Android P 
preview 

01:44:05.907 --> 01:44:08.758
SDK and can play around with the
TV emulator and try it out.  

01:44:08.759 --> 01:44:11.428
There are some other neat things
in there.  For example, external

01:44:11.429 --> 01:44:13.429
camera support.

01:44:15.369 --> 01:44:17.369
So you can start writing camera 
apps for TV.

01:44:19.899 --> 01:44:22.139
We are also going to release a 
lot more documentation around 

01:44:22.140 --> 01:44:24.140
the 

01:44:25.228 --> 01:44:30.251
performance aspects but we want 
to talk about two more things.  

01:44:30.252 --> 01:44:32.234
We talked a lot about software 
but we also thought about what a

01:44:32.235 --> 01:44:34.235
cool hardware experience.

01:44:35.507 --> 01:44:37.362
What a cool devices that could 
expand the experience in the 

01:44:37.363 --> 01:44:39.363
living room.  And one of the 
questions we asked 

01:44:42.083 --> 01:44:43.306
ourselves is how would a really 
cool living room experience with

01:44:43.307 --> 01:44:45.956
a device being the center, the 
hub of the living 

01:44:49.429 --> 01:44:51.266
room with assistant intd greated
very easy-to-use, controlling 

01:44:51.267 --> 01:44:53.267
all my other 

01:44:55.561 --> 01:44:57.561
devices, and bring me the best 
Android 

01:44:59.854 --> 01:45:01.316
TV experience on to my TV screen
how would something like that 

01:45:01.317 --> 01:45:03.968
look like.  And the outcome of 
that asking -- the 

01:45:08.515 --> 01:45:09.942
answer to that was something 
like this.  

01:45:09.943 --> 01:45:11.943
(Video). 

01:45:12.956 --> 01:45:14.956
&gt;&gt;

01:45:27.262 --> 01:45:29.262
Hey Google, turn on the TV.  

01:45:34.529 --> 01:45:36.529
&gt;&gt; Hey Google Play the Clemson

01:45:38.487 --> 01:45:40.716
football game on ESPN. 
   &gt;&gt; Here is some information 

01:45:40.717 --> 01:45:42.717
about Star Trek discovery. 

01:45:46.791 --> 01:45:49.778
&gt;&gt; Hey Google show me potato 
battery videos on Youtube kids. 

01:45:49.779 --> 01:45:53.347
   &gt;&gt; Okay.  Here is potato 
battery videos on Youtube kids. 

01:45:53.348 --> 01:45:57.192
   &gt;&gt; Hey Google how long is 
college football overtime. 

01:45:59.011 --> 01:46:00.439
&gt;&gt; It is commonly ten minutes 
long. 

01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:03.137
&gt;&gt; This is really good.  
   &gt;&gt; Hey Google buy for kettle 

01:46:03.138 --> 01:46:05.138
corn. 

01:46:07.022 --> 01:46:08.060
&gt;&gt; Here is what I found on 
Google express. 

01:46:08.061 --> 01:46:10.061
&gt;&gt; I need to show. 

01:46:11.131 --> 01:46:13.779
&gt;&gt; Hold up, hey Google, dim the 
lights, turn off the TV and play

01:46:13.780 --> 01:46:15.822
some music on Pandora.  

01:46:18.838 --> 01:46:20.838
&gt;&gt; Whoa. 

01:46:23.565 --> 01:46:25.565
&gt;&gt; 
   (Applause.

01:46:27.048 --> 01:46:29.048
)

01:46:34.429 --> 01:46:36.615
&gt;&gt; SASCHA PRUETER:  So as you 
might have seen already starting

01:46:36.616 --> 01:46:38.616
yesterday in 

01:46:39.683 --> 01:46:41.683
some media outlets we announced 
with our 

01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:46.463
partner JBL the JBL Link Bar 
powered by Android TV.  It is an

01:46:46.464 --> 01:46:48.464
awesome sound bar.

01:46:53.241 --> 01:46:55.724
It has Google assistant antant 
intd greated and because we put 

01:46:55.725 --> 01:46:59.198
microphones in to the device, 
you don't have to pick up the TV

01:46:59.199 --> 01:47:03.716
remote control.  You sit on the 
sofa and start talking to the 

01:47:03.717 --> 01:47:05.950
device and you can control the 
whole experience.  It has really

01:47:05.951 --> 01:47:10.477
awesome sound.  There will be an
optional a subwoofor that you 

01:47:10.478 --> 01:47:12.478
can order with it as well.

01:47:15.201 --> 01:47:17.201
And what I think really cool 
feature 

01:47:18.663 --> 01:47:20.712
is three HDMIs and you might 
think why is that so cool.

01:47:23.995 --> 01:47:25.027
You really can control your 
whole home entertainment 

01:47:25.028 --> 01:47:27.673
experience with this.  Because a
lot of you might have or you 

01:47:30.327 --> 01:47:32.327
might have a play station or a 
Xbox or 

01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:35.641
you might still have that 
Blu-ray player or maybe that 

01:47:35.642 --> 01:47:38.095
cable setup box that you still 
really like.  So you can connect

01:47:38.096 --> 01:47:40.096
all these devices 

01:47:42.588 --> 01:47:43.398
to the JBL Link Bar and then use
the assistant to control, for 

01:47:43.399 --> 01:47:45.399
example, you 

01:47:46.463 --> 01:47:48.496
want to switch to the Play 
Station and it just magically 

01:47:48.497 --> 01:47:51.809
happens.  And also if let's say 
you are playing a game on the 

01:47:51.810 --> 01:47:53.810
play station and then you have a
question for the assistant, u 

01:47:56.759 --> 01:47:58.776
just ask the assistant and the 
assistant can answer, can show 

01:47:58.777 --> 01:48:00.777
you the answer 

01:48:02.301 --> 01:48:04.301
cards over your current HDMI 
input.

01:48:05.974 --> 01:48:08.261
So it is not just a pass through
HDMI.  These are active inputs 

01:48:08.262 --> 01:48:10.777
and it shows you the power of 
the assistant and the 

01:48:17.953 --> 01:48:20.235
Android tee TV as a living room 
platform.  The other cool thing 

01:48:20.236 --> 01:48:23.354
that we are working to get this 
-- the in to a speaker only mode

01:48:23.355 --> 01:48:26.005
as well.  Because sometimes you 
need the TV screen.

01:48:30.076 --> 01:48:32.729
You don't -- to listen to audio,
to listen to music, to maybe 

01:48:32.730 --> 01:48:34.730
just ask 

01:48:36.205 --> 01:48:38.205
something really turning this 
down in to 

01:48:39.863 --> 01:48:41.481
an very low key smart speaker is
also cool.  So this device can 

01:48:41.482 --> 01:48:43.482
do all of those things.  And 
maybe sometimes you just want to

01:48:47.070 --> 01:48:48.495
send some music via Bluetooth or
cast audio to the device.  It 

01:48:48.496 --> 01:48:50.746
works as well.  It is your 
one-stop shop for the living 

01:48:50.747 --> 01:48:57.101
room.  Can control everything.  
It is super easy.  It will also 

01:48:57.102 --> 01:48:59.141
come with a remote control but 
if you prefer to just use it 

01:49:02.013 --> 01:49:04.101
with Voice, well, it is really 
easy.  

01:49:05.319 --> 01:49:07.319
You should check it out.

01:49:09.430 --> 01:49:11.430
We have it in our Android TV 
sandbox 

01:49:12.703 --> 01:49:14.335
in sandbox C and ask some of the
folks from the team to give you 

01:49:14.336 --> 01:49:16.377
a demo.  It is really cool.  It 
sounds good.

01:49:21.104 --> 01:49:26.191
And it will launch in fall 2018.
So I said two more things, 

01:49:26.192 --> 01:49:28.192
right?

01:49:30.687 --> 01:49:33.145
So one other thing we talked a 
lot about Android P earlier and 

01:49:33.146 --> 01:49:36.233
as a developer you want to 
follow all the things Ben just 

01:49:36.234 --> 01:49:38.234
told you.

01:49:39.337 --> 01:49:41.337
And you might ask, yeah, you 
told me I 

01:49:44.093 --> 01:49:45.998
can download the Android P SDK 
and work with the emulator but I

01:49:45.999 --> 01:49:48.443
would like to have actual 
hardware for this.

01:49:53.644 --> 01:49:55.644
So I don't know who of you was 
an at 

01:49:59.877 --> 01:50:01.877
Google I/O in 2014, lots of of 
hands.

01:50:06.184 --> 01:50:06.791
Some of you were already in 
Muskone in 2014 and you might 

01:50:06.792 --> 01:50:08.792
remember that we 

01:50:10.003 --> 01:50:15.623
launched a device that was 
called the ADT-1.  We thought 

01:50:15.624 --> 01:50:17.624
why -- you can applaud if you 
want.

01:50:20.732 --> 01:50:24.221
But we thought it is time for 
another developer device.  So we

01:50:24.222 --> 01:50:29.538
are introducing ADT-2.  
   (Applause.) 

01:50:30.565 --> 01:50:32.565
&gt;&gt; SASCHA PRUETER:  So you might
want 

01:50:33.854 --> 01:50:36.148
to write down that sign up form 
link because you are the first 

01:50:36.149 --> 01:50:38.149
people to see 

01:50:39.203 --> 01:50:42.078
this and be able to sign up for 
this.  It is actually pretty 

01:50:42.079 --> 01:50:45.424
good test for Google lens.  
Anyway -- 

01:50:46.445 --> 01:50:48.445
&gt;&gt; BENJAMIN BAXTER:  If you they
go 

01:50:51.387 --> 01:50:54.069
to the sandbox later and check 
out the sound bar, you also get 

01:50:54.070 --> 01:50:55.924
an e-mail with this link as 
well.  

01:50:55.925 --> 01:50:57.925
&gt;&gt; SASCHA PRUETER:  Yes.

01:51:03.639 --> 01:51:05.639
This is is a is a neat little 
HDMI dangle.

01:51:09.250 --> 01:51:09.860
You can try out all the 
assistant that Ben just talked 

01:51:09.861 --> 01:51:16.003
about.  It will run an Android P
developer preview release.  We 

01:51:16.004 --> 01:51:18.004
will send updates to the device.

01:51:21.100 --> 01:51:24.753
We are sending updates to the 
sound bar.  Will send updates 

01:51:24.754 --> 01:51:29.268
right to the device.  And so you
can use this device.  Try out 

01:51:29.269 --> 01:51:31.269
all the cool things.

01:51:33.300 --> 01:51:37.366
It is a limited edition device. 
So you know about it first.  

01:51:33.300 --> 01:51:35.300
Sign up.

01:51:37.657 --> 01:51:39.657
We will actually start to send 
this out later this summer.

01:51:43.357 --> 01:51:45.357
And it is a neat little device 
and we 

01:51:46.435 --> 01:51:50.303
are excited about it.  Sign up 
for it.  And build cool apps.  

01:51:50.304 --> 01:51:55.838
That's kind of it already.  I 
said two more things.  It was 

01:51:55.839 --> 01:52:00.297
two more things.  We have -- if 
you are working on apps we have 

01:52:00.298 --> 01:52:02.298
some more interesting events 

01:52:03.704 --> 01:52:05.716
that you might be interested in.
Ben I don't know if you want to 

01:52:05.717 --> 01:52:07.717
mention. 

01:52:08.969 --> 01:52:09.907
&gt;&gt; BENJAMIN BAXTER:  Come visit 
us in office hours.  We have 

01:52:09.908 --> 01:52:11.958
back to back app reviews in 
office hours.  We are going to 

01:52:11.959 --> 01:52:15.628
be down the road a little bit 
with office hours tent is.  If 

01:52:15.629 --> 01:52:17.461
you have questions, come bring 
them.  If you are bored and you 

01:52:17.462 --> 01:52:19.462
still want to 

01:52:21.121 --> 01:52:23.771
do TV stuff we have two new 
Codelabs in the Codelab section.

01:52:28.043 --> 01:52:29.070
One focuses on Play Next row and
one focus on an overview of the 

01:52:29.071 --> 01:52:33.382
entire home screen.  We look 
forward to seeing you and bring 

01:52:33.383 --> 01:52:34.828
your questions there.  
   &gt;&gt; SASCHA PRUETER:  Yep and 

01:52:34.829 --> 01:52:36.829
talking 

01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:40.040
about questions,

01:52:42.385 --> 01:52:44.385
obviously want feedback from you
but if 

01:52:45.495 --> 01:52:47.495
you have -- if you have 
questions you 

01:52:49.999 --> 01:52:51.865
see those microphones, we are 
not using them, because of 

01:52:51.866 --> 01:52:55.147
timing we will get shuffled out 
of here very soon.  But Ben and 

01:52:55.148 --> 01:52:59.303
I will be over right after this 
talk in the Android TV sandbox. 

01:52:59.304 --> 01:53:01.304
Come over and talk to us.

01:53:03.895 --> 01:53:05.713
Ask us questions and I will most
likely point to Ben to answer 

01:53:05.714 --> 01:53:10.209
those questions.  Thank you very
much.  Build code TV apps and I 

01:53:10.210 --> 01:53:12.658
hope we will see you next year. 
   &gt;&gt; BENJAMIN BAXTER:  Thank 

01:53:12.659 --> 01:53:14.659
you.  
   (Applause.

01:53:15.876 --> 01:53:17.876
)

01:53:29.864 --> 01:53:32.507
   &gt;&gt; Thank you for joining this
session.

01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:40.080
Grand ambassadors will assist 
with 

01:53:44.227 --> 01:53:46.227
designating you through the 
exits
