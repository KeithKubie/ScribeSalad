00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.980
PROFESSOR: So we began just a
few months ago with this goal

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.250
of trying to understand the
scientific study of human

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.930
nature, how our mind operates,
why we behave the way we do.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.410
From the brain basis, how we see
and hear the world, how we

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.680
think, how we feel, our
predispositions to act in

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.870
certain ways, how we develop
from infancy to adolescence to

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.100
adulthood, through the
middle ages and into

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.880
old age, we all hope.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.590
The remarkably odd things
about human social

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.140
interactions, which are
just amazing I think.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.180
And the challenges that so
many people face, with a

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.440
degree of vulnerability in these
very kinds of abilities

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.010
and behaviors.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.480
And so it's hard to know
what to conclude on.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.360
So I thought I would touch
on two things.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.580
One, sort of fun to think about,
hard to know how to

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.510
think about scientifically.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.170
And one, it probably matters
to us all the time.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.250
So let me talk about this.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.190
So when we think about why we
do things, how our brain is

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.020
organized, mind is organized,
we know that we've evolved

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.770
over a long period of time,
from other species.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.270
And that many things in us
reflect this evolutionary

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.630
history, cast into a modern,
unimaginable world from the

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.440
viewpoint of biology.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.600
But here we are, sort of
creatures from the past living

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.620
in an incredibly accelerated,
changing environment.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.240
And so evolutionary psychology,
people say, let's

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.500
try to identify why we have
certain patterns of thoughts

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.605
and feelings, given the
evolutionary history of our

00:02:02.605 --> 00:02:04.240
minds and brains.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.160
And I'll say a word
about that.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.690
It's tough in many ways though
to have, as much as you

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.630
believe that's true, it's got to
be true, it's very tough to

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.070
approach scientifically.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.590
Because often, it comes down
to people telling fun,

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.510
interesting, clever stories.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.090
Very hard to test.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.690
So we know it's a big part of
who we are, in a deep sense

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.120
where we came from.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.120
Very hard to test
experimentally.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.610
But I'll show you a couple
examples where people have

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:29.980
probed this a bit.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.495
And then another question is
in the last decade, some

00:02:32.495 --> 00:02:34.960
people have said, well so much
of psychology seems to focus

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.530
on the negative, the harm
we're willing to do, the

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.340
stereotypes we're
willing to hold.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.690
How about positive psychology?

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.050
How about thinking about what
can we learn from psychology

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.660
to lead a better, happier,
more meaningful life.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.260
As I'm going to tell you about
the core results about

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.280
research about happiness.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.730
And some of them I think
will surprise you.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.910
Some of them, you'll tuck in the
back of your mind maybe,

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.900
as you think about what
will make you happy.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.510
I mean we all want to be
happy in a deep sense.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.620
We don't know what's on the
other side of this life.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.460
But we know this is the one
we have in our hands.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.210
And so what can psychology
suggest that might make you

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.600
think what's a path
to happiness?

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.890
So we talked about throughout
this course about the fragile

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.350
power of the human brain.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.010
It endows us with an
unbelievable capacity for

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.410
thought, sight, behavior,
vulnerabilities at every

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.890
stage, from neurological
injuries to

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.890
neuropsychiatric disorders.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.020
And again, we know this all has
grown through this Paul

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.670
MacLean triune brain idea, that
within us are kind of a

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.020
version of reptilian brains,
within us are simple mammalian

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.030
brains, and then finally
the primate and

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.190
human expanded neocortex.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.110
And so within us, it's almost
as if we represent in a

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.280
certain sense, our species
history, literally in your

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.160
brain, literally right now,
in some complex way of

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.040
interactions.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.090
With parts of the brain that
have evolved modestly and

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.650
parts that evolved spectacularly
in humans.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.540
And the usual story, you're used
to this in evolution, is

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.640
that our brains and minds
evolved in nature.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.910
And natural selection was the
dominating part of the story.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.399
Survival of the fittest for
passing genes into the next

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:22.100
generation, that sort of all
stories boil down to that.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.150
And I'm going to tell you
two specific examples.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.070
One that surprised me and then
one that's just sort of fun I

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.730
think in a silly way.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.340
So the first one is attitudes
towards race and sex.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.000
And this can came up.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.380
And then the second one is
different attitudes in men and

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.600
women, who might have in terms
of sex and procreation.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.040
So let me focus on this
for a moment.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.290
In the last election, you may
remember that there was a

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:53.410
long, grueling race across the
primaries between Hillary

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.070
Clinton and Barack Obama.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.160
And in many ways, this is a huge
surprise in the United

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.870
States, because with such a
history of racism and sexism,

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.750
the idea that the two leading
candidates are a woman and an

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.660
African American, was just
kind of an amazing thing.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.510
As much as we had distance
to go, that we

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:14.640
have come that far.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.140
That these were the two
candidates on the Democratic

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.240
side, who are competing state
to state across the country,

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.370
one of whom would become
the Democratic

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.890
nominee and the President.

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:26.710
And I got call from a reporter
from the Boston Globe.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.410
And he said, he was writing a
story saying, which is the

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.220
worst problem these candidates
faced, sexism or racism?

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.650
And many of us, and I'm no
exception, our egos get turned

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.120
up when somebody from
the press calls.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.740
Because our name will
be in the newspaper.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.770
And we can show it to our
friends and family.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.940
And then they know we have a
real job and somebody thinks

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.750
we know something.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:50.200
You laugh.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.380
And the graduate students,
like their parents never

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.570
understand anything,
except when their

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:54.700
name gets in the newspaper.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.300
You know how that is, right?

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.850
So I thought, well, I'm going to
say something really clever

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:02.510
and all the neuroscience and
all the psychology I know,

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.410
either from my own research or
for teaching this course.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:05.080
I'll have something.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.160
And I just had nothing to say.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.820
I mean we can agree
that racism is bad

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:08.970
and sexism is bad.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:12.380
And it's kind of excellent that
candidates are beating

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.710
those glass ceilings in the
national leadership.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.265
We know from research on things
like the IAT test, that

00:06:19.265 --> 00:06:21.120
you heard about, that both
remain a problem.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.380
Negative stereotypes of certain
kinds remain in our

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.700
society to this day,
across society.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.770
So I was like, which is worst,
terrible thing A or

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:32.800
terrible thing B?

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.000
And I had nothing to say.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.290
And then a newspaper article
came out and said, oh,

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:41.320
according to evolutionary
psychologists, and I was not

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.580
included, because I
nothing to say.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.530
This was very sad.

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.370
They said well, really Hillary
Clinton faces the harder path.

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:51.740
Because in their mind, sexism
is built into our species.

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.310
Because the whole idea of how
we procreate, how men and

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:58.360
women relate in species and
investments, that's deep in

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.580
us, all through evolution.

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.320
Whereas racism is culturally
specific and malleable.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.990
There's countries where one
group is picked on.

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:09.170
There's countries where another
group is picked on.

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:11.570
There's changes in societies.

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:13.050
That's a changeable thing.

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.260
This is a tougher thing
to change, was their

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:15.920
interpretation.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.440
I thought well, that
sounds good.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.490
And it might even be true.

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.490
It's like a lot of evolutionary
psychology, a

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.510
good possibility, a better
answer by infinitely far than

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:25.640
I could give.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:26.980
But who knows?

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.980
And then this one study came
out, that's kind of curious.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:35.320
So this is a study of children
with Williams syndrome, a rare

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.880
disorder, but very studied in
both human genetics and human

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.770
psychology.

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:41.950
And partly, it's interesting.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:43.690
These are the unusual
facial features of

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:45.060
these kinds of children.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.630
They're born this way.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:49.540
And it's caused by deletion of
26 genes from the long arm of

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:50.410
chromosome 7.

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:54.180
It's one of the most purely
defined and specific genetic

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.970
developmental disorders
in humans.

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:59.110
So it's really drawn the
interest of geneticists.

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:03.490
Because it's a disorder that's
really very linked to a very

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:08.790
specific part of the human
genome always.

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:11.760
Distinctive, what they call
elfin facial features,

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.330
developmentally delayed
language skills.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:19.570
And maybe the most curious and
charming element is unusually

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:21.800
cheerful demeanor and
ease with strangers.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.150
These are the children who will
walk up to strangers and

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:29.140
talk your ear off and not be
afraid of anybody or anything.

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:32.159
To an extent that's charming,
can get you in trouble with

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:35.740
the world being the way it is.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.429
It's sometimes contrasted
with autism.

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:39.700
Because individual with autism
find social interactions

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.880
sometimes laborious, difficult,
mysterious.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.320
These individuals find it
delightful, nonstop.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.590
You get tired sometimes of
talking to such children,

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:50.570
because they're ready to go
infinitely in terms of social

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:52.070
interaction.

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:53.680
And there's been some study
that they have atypical

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.690
amygdala function and lack
of fear response there.

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:58.800
So that's the background about
Williams syndrome.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.370
And then somebody
did a IAT study.

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:02.270
This was in France.

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:05.150
But its been replicated since.

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:06.990
That shows that for these
children with Williams

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:11.100
syndrome, they still have
a gender IAT effect.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:14.000
That is for example, they're
willing to consider women less

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.990
likely to be good at
science and math,

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.290
which we know is silly.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.270
But that's the stereotype.

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:22.810
But they showed no racial
IAT effect.

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:25.660
And they had control
participants who showed both.

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:27.340
So now, there's still
interpretation.

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:31.920
But all of sudden, it's as if
this is deeper in the brain.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.650
And maybe this is learned.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:35.900
And these children aren't
learning this one.

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:39.000
But they can't stop this one.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.090
So a suggestion that there is
something true about this

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:44.160
evolutionary psychology thing.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.390
And that maybe the hardest thing
for us to change deep

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:50.770
down, because of the fundamental
sexual relations

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:52.310
in procreation.

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:55.340
That's a hard thing for us to
work our head around, without

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.160
being thoughtful and
careful about it.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.810
So here's an experiment that
was used to demonstrate.

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:03.610
So what's the usual story?

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:06.440
The usual story in evolution
is people on average, not

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.830
everybody of course,
wants to have kids.

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:09.870
Because that's how they
pass their genes down.

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:13.300
And who has a lot of investment
per kid, in however

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.710
way you look it?

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:16.520
Women.

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:20.080
For women it's, just the first
part is nine months.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.570
And then the immediate
support.

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:26.240
For men, how long is the
minimal contribution?

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:26.970
15 seconds.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:29.170
OK, well 15 minutes.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:29.860
It varies.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:31.110
But you know.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.180
So there's a theory that if the
thing you cared about was

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:37.740
just getting us your genes down

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.370
there as much as possible.

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:42.230
Was it Wilt Chamberlain, the
former basketball player, who

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:43.850
said he had slept with
1,000 women.

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:47.620
That he would be like the
champion example in men.

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:52.230
And with women, it's you can't
do a 1,000 nine-month cycles.

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:54.190
So that for men, if that
was the only thing in

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:55.120
life, and it's not.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.260
But here's the experiment
they did.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.200
We couldn't have an
IRB approve this.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.450
But this was done
at a university.

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:02.610
And they said, we're going
to show you an

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:03.450
experiment like this.

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:05.680
And this is meant to
be kind of silly.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:06.690
But this is how evolutionary

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:07.850
psychology, things are expressed.

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:09.450
And it's kind of
funny, I think.

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:10.870
We'll see.

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:13.656
So what they would do is they
pick take an attractive man

00:11:13.656 --> 00:11:14.520
and an attractive woman.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.440
They were the confederates.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.880
And they would approach a
student leaving the library, a

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.090
random student.

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:22.400
And here's the responder,
who is a woman.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.620
Imagine yourself as women now,
for those of you who are

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:27.560
woman, leaving a library, kind
of late at night, not too

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:27.870
threatening.

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:32.180
But somebody walks up to you and
says, I've noticed you in

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:33.540
the library a few times.

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.260
You seem very nice.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:36.890
Do you think there's any chance
we could get together

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:40.000
for a date sometime?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.090
What percentage of
women said yes?

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:48.155
In this study, 50%.

00:11:48.155 --> 00:11:50.680
Do you think that's high?

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.800
Let's pretend it was
a better approach

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:57.376
than what I just said.

00:11:57.376 --> 00:11:59.450
I tried to make it low
key and nice, a

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:00.700
low key, nice approach.

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:07.230
For other women, the same male
confederate walks up and says,

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:08.050
I've noticed you in library.

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:09.490
You seem very nice.

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:12.570
What do you about going back
to my apartment and having

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:13.820
some coffee?

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:16.510
We'll take turns then.

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:19.160
Women, what do you think
is the number?

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:20.630
We start with 50.

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:20.880
What?

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.130
20.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:27.540
I noticed you in the library.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:28.290
You seem very nice.

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:31.010
I think there's something
compatible between us.

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:32.715
What do you think about going
back to my apartment and

00:12:32.715 --> 00:12:33.965
having sex right now?

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:38.820
See finally, the course
gets super practical.

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:45.400
I'm not saying it.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.580
This is just one study.

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:48.540
Now, we reverse the roles.

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:51.040
Men, you get ready, all right?

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.040
An attractive woman walks up to
you and says, I noticed in

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:53.450
the library.

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:54.590
You seem very friendly.

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:56.030
We seem to be compatible.

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:58.574
Would you be willing to have
a date with me some time?

00:12:58.574 --> 00:12:59.824
AUDIENCE: 100%.

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:06.530
PROFESSOR: Would you be willing,
the woman says to the

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:10.230
man, to go back to my apartment
with me right now?

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:20.770
All right, you know
where this going.

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:22.210
An attractive woman walks
up to the man.

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:24.560
And she says, would you go back
to my apartment to have

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:25.990
sex with me this very minute?

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:33.750
The guys got things to do.

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:35.610
You now, he can't--

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:36.100
Yeah?

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.410
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:40.580
PROFESSOR: What is the
citation for this?

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:41.090
Let me get that.

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:42.460
I heard it in a talk.

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:42.520
And I saw the numbers.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.850
The numbers are correct.

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:46.820
I have to say when this was
presented, there was some

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.360
murmuring, because maybe it
wasn't quite IRB-approved.

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.540
I heard it from a good source.

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:53.860
I'll get that for you.

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:55.110
It's in your notes.

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:02.560
So evolutionary psychology,
whatever, it's kind of fun.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.340
But it's hard to know
where it gets you.

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:06.360
But it's definitely
fun to talk about.

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.300
So happiness research.

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:13.560
So for a long time, from ancient
philosophy to the

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.750
founding of the US and
everything, people said, the

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:17.960
objective of life, as we choose
it, Aristotle, for

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.180
itself, and never for
any other reason.

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:22.640
And one of the most amazing
phrases in the Declaration of

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:24.290
independence, "We hold these
truths to be self-evident,

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:25.890
that all men are created equal,
that they are endowed

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:27.800
by their Creator with certain
unalienable Rights, that among

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.560
these are life and liberty."
Well, that we would think

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.970
would be obvious things, now.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:35.220
But this amazing thing, "and
the pursuit of Happiness."

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:38.350
As important as life itself
and liberty itself, the

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:39.270
pursuit of happiness.

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:42.320
And I think we know that in our
own lives, as we relate to

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:46.350
other people, as we pursue
careers, as we do things,

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:50.220
where we put our limited
lifetime resources, time and

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:53.390
effort, we all want to end up in
a deep way to be happy and

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:56.030
make the choices to get there.

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:58.570
So we can think on average, you
could think in your head

00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:00.720
what makes you happy, what
makes you want unhappy?

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.430
And a standard list
might be, people

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:05.330
definitely want to be healthy.

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:07.420
Nobody minds being wealthy.

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:09.140
We'll talk about that.

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:11.610
It never hurts to get
a new car, a new TV,

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:13.230
or new stuff, right?

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:14.110
What makes you unhappy?

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:16.390
Physical injury, emotional
injury.

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:20.080
I mean that would be
kind of standard.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.680
Now, how do you measure
happiness?

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.590
And this is the part where you
get us into the funniness of

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:25.100
psychology.

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:29.220
So you have with you a
questionnaire, which is one of

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:32.620
the most widely used measures
of happiness.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:34.670
So I'll just give you a
moment to look at it.

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:35.740
You could fill it out
for yourself.

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:38.080
We're not going to collect it.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.580
And you may even want
to or whatever.

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:40.920
But just to get a
feeling of this.

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.140
And you could say--

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:42.980
oh, sorry.

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:44.190
Anybody else who didn't
get it, that we

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:45.440
could help you with?

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:49.135
A few hands over here.

00:15:49.135 --> 00:15:50.385
Oh, thank you.

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:56.570
Again, let me say whoever did
this amazing display is maybe

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:57.210
super happy.

00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:59.120
So you're ahead of me.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.370
Thank you.

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.070
So it's measured
in life value.

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:07.830
You ask the person like
basically, how happy are you?

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:10.810
And we have a tendency to be
suspicious of just asking

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:11.670
people straight on.

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:15.080
Because if we ask them straight
on, would you say

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.160
this line is as big as
this line, if three

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:17.710
other people said that?

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:19.190
You'd say, no, not me.

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:22.660
If you say, would you zap
somebody until you think

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:24.340
they're dead in another room?

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:25.890
You'd say no, not me.

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:29.300
So we're very suspicious about
what people say they will do

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:30.830
and what they really do.

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:34.440
But for happiness research,
it's hard to beat that.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:35.040
Here's another one.

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:38.920
You can circle the happiness
that represents you.

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.560
Because what's the better
question, what's the more

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:44.450
objective measure to decide that
somebody's happy, a brain

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:46.080
image, a blood test?

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:49.290
We don't have a better thing
than the person's own

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:51.630
statement about their
sense of happiness.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:53.790
All the way back to a Roman
philosopher, "The happy man is

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:57.170
not he who seems thus to others,
but who seems thus to

00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:01.850
himself." We don't know of a
better way to ask you if

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:04.230
you're happy, than to
ask if you're happy.

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:07.050
So it's not the most satisfying
kind of objective,

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:08.660
scientific measure.

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:10.349
But maybe it's the life
we lead anywhere.

00:17:10.349 --> 00:17:13.770
We decide if we're happy
or not, in some sense.

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:18.359
So if you ask people on average
how happy they are,

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:20.760
2/3 of the people will put
themselves here, almost

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.099
everybody above average.

00:17:22.099 --> 00:17:25.764
A few people report that they're
consistently unhappy.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.850
And I'm going to come back to
this, but the thing that

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:33.960
struck happiness researchers,
surprisingly modest

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.380
influences, and I'm going to
touch this up a little bit

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:40.970
with a research study, of social
status, income, gender,

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:41.600
or ethnicity.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.200
A number of things that you
could have thought would touch

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:49.690
that, surprisingly don't touch
it, or in very limited ways.

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:53.160
But I'll tell you a little bit
about those limited ways.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.990
So on a seven-point scale,
the average is 4 or a 5.

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:58.010
College students, 4.9.

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:00.050
Older people, happier.

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:01.130
We've talk about that before.

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:03.710
Ironically, even though older
people probably face more

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:07.930
challenges in various ways and
limited life spans, they seem

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:09.180
happier by self-report.

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:16.910
One argument that income has
little relationship is this

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:19.410
kind of a graph, that looks at
the average income in the US

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:21.540
from 1930 to 1991.

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:24.650
So here's this increase, that's
not going up anymore.

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:27.160
But it was in the
last century.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:28.980
And self-reported happiness.

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:32.650
And you can see that at some
point, it goes up, but then it

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:34.750
flattens out.

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:37.830
So the general thought analysis,
I'll show you a

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:44.020
little bit more detail, is, not
much money or in current

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:47.570
situations, poverty,
does strike down

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:49.200
people's sense of happiness.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.660
But once you get above some
threshold, and of course, what

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:54.770
that threshold is varies in so
many ways depending on who you

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:57.310
are and what you expect, but
once you get above some

00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:59.480
threshold, that's not
the biggest part

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.020
of the story anymore.

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:05.770
And that's pretty much
a general finding.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:07.570
They've done all kinds
of surveys about

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:09.220
happiness across countries.

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:11.410
It's a really interesting
thing about happiness

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:13.650
research, it's more powerful
than you can imagine in

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:16.900
grabbing hold of the minds of
many people in public policy.

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:19.380
Derek Bok, the former president
of Harvard, has

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:22.750
written a book suggesting that
happiness research ought to be

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:25.490
the basis of public policies
by the government.

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:30.210
That if know what makes people
happy, short of giving

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:33.070
everybody $1 million every year,
why wouldn't you tweak

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:36.610
every policy, even if people
don't think it will make them

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:39.510
happy, but you know from
research it will?

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:42.480
And then here's a world map,
where they surveyed people all

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.310
over the place.

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:45.260
The darker the color,
the more people

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:46.810
reported themselves happy.

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:50.090
Now, this is very tricky.

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:53.320
Because now you're in full
scale, there's things like

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:56.610
poverty, but there's also things
like cultural emphases.

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:59.470
In the US, we talk a lot
about happiness.

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:02.110
That concept is less prevalent
in many other cultures,

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:03.300
relatively speaking.

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.320
So it's hard to know how much
is the culture, how much is

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:10.040
the actual per capita
income relevant.

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:12.240
But people are pursuing
these things.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.530
And they are finding roughly--

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:17.060
the most recent one, that
again in countries where

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:21.040
there's a lot of poverty, it's
less than in countries where

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:22.980
you start to have
higher incomes.

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:27.270
So poverty is still associated
with less happiness.

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:31.250
And you can guess that
is reasonable.

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:33.530
And then more studies
like this,

00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:35.580
again about that direction.

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:41.730
So early on, people said
that income has

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:43.130
nothing to do with happiness.

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:45.500
And that seems not quite right,
especially at the lower

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:46.380
end of poverty.

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:50.280
Now, Dan Kahneman, the Nobel
Laureate, a psychologist at

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.910
Princeton, has spent the last
few years talking about what

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:54.440
he calls the focusing
illusion.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.505
And let me tell you
what that is.

00:20:55.505 --> 00:20:59.080
It's basically this, when
thinking about one topic, it

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:02.070
could be income, could be
graduate school admissions.

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:05.280
Like whatever the topic is,
fairness, whatever the topic

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.950
is, when you're thinking about
that one topic, people tend to

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:10.850
attribute more importance to
that topic than it really has.

00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:13.400
They think it accounts for more
of what goes in the world

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.730
when they're focused on it.

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:16.950
And you see this all the time
in political discussions.

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:18.350
Like it's all the deficit.

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:20.440
If we just fix the deficit,
everything works.

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.520
It's all raising taxes.

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:22.670
If we just do this.

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:24.220
People fixate on one thing.

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:26.240
And then that's the answer
to the whole problem.

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:29.960
That all the time, never mind
political debates where things

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:31.380
might be staged, but
even in one's own

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:32.920
personal life, that happens.

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.170
Let me give you an example
of how they

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:35.700
showed that to be true.

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.800
They have people rate their
happiness, just like you have.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.880
And then they ask them, and
these were, how many dates for

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.070
the single people, how many
dates in the last month?

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:46.890
And they get no correlation
between self-rated happiness

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:49.720
and how many dates you've
had in the last month.

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.140
Now they were reverse
for some people,

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:52.590
the order of questions.

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:55.785
How many dates have you had in
the last month and now rate

00:21:55.785 --> 00:21:56.490
your happiness.

00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:57.990
And they get a positive
correlation.

00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:01.800
The more dates you had, the
happier your report yourself.

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:05.710
Well, for people who are dating,
on average, that's a

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:07.970
measure, like getting out there
and meeting people.

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:10.190
It's an average of succeeding
in some path

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:11.360
you want to be on.

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.220
So when you just thought about
this, you said, whoa, if I had

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:18.280
no dates this past month, I
must be pretty miserable.

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:19.090
I'm pretty unhappy.

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:20.240
I'm thinking about that.

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.980
And all the other elements of
your life that contribute to

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.360
happiness, because you
just focused on that.

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:26.980
You just focused on that because
the question was

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:29.520
asked, recede
disproportionately, compared

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:30.620
to the actual importance.

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:32.440
If you go the other way around,
how happy you are, and

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:34.980
you ask this, there's no
correlation, because you're

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:38.370
not thinking about this one
thing and weighting your

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:41.470
overall happiness by this one
question or dimension.

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:42.610
Does that make sense?

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:46.350
So the order is the
whole story.

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:49.030
That people, when they think
about a topic and then think

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:52.650
of how happy or meaningful it
is, they overvalue that topic,

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:54.650
because they just
focused in their

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:58.190
minds on this one dimension.

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:02.110
So getting back to this issue
of income and how that goes

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:04.980
with happiness, here's what
they did, the same thing

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:08.040
again, by asking a specific
question and then asking your

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:10.020
general impression,
the same idea.

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:14.040
So they said, how bad was your
mood the previous day?

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.350
So there's a specific
question about mood.

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:18.740
Now, how much time do you think
people with various

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:21.770
income levels are
in a bad mood?

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:23.690
And they picked for example,
people making less than

00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:28.580
$20,000 or people making
more than $100,000.

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:30.900
These people who just answered
this question said, gee--

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:32.150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:36.930
PROFESSOR: I don't
see anything.

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:38.180
That's right.

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:42.160
Thank you very much.

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:04.180
The cool thing is now
that they're making

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:05.300
videos of these lectures.

00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:08.030
We have so many applicants
to be your peers in

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:08.710
the years to come.

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:11.510
It's going to be unbelievable.

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:13.880
So you guys are great.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:18.260
So they said it was about 32%
more bad mood, if you were

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:19.530
making less or more.

00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:22.060
If you asked people making
how much, it's only a 12%

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:22.400
difference.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.030
It matters, but only
a third as much.

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:26.540
Because you just got
them thinking about

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:27.570
being in a bad mood.

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:33.830
So now they over attribute
income for daily happiness.

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:35.120
And here's a kind of
interesting thing.

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:35.880
And it's a trade-off.

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.440
And it gets us to what
is it in your life

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.740
that makes you happy.

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:45.140
So people making over $100,000
spend about 20% more time on--

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:48.920
I've got this reversed.

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:56.430
So people making over $100,000
spend more time--

00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:57.210
I'll fix the slide up.

00:24:57.210 --> 00:24:57.830
Sorry.

00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:00.780
Spend more time on doing things
that they report as

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:05.320
being kind of stressful, work,
pressure shopping for the

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:08.180
family, pressured childcare
situations, what they call

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:09.950
obligatory tasks.

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:12.690
And people who make less money,
spend considerably more

00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:16.240
time doing things that everybody
considers fun when

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:19.480
they're doing it, socializing,
or watching TV that you like.

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:20.760
So you can see it's
kind of weird.

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:24.630
It's a little bit of where you
put your time and what counts

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:27.035
for you to feel happy
about something.

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:31.640
Everybody's in pretty much
agreement, like you've heard

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:34.670
about almost everything, twin
studies suggest, the set point

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:36.400
of happiness, where you rate
yourself as always

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:40.300
super-happy, moderately happy,
or somewhat grumpy, seems to

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:44.650
be about between 15%
and 80% heritable.

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:49.630
It's as if a piece of us is born
to be super-happy, medium

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:53.160
happy, or chronically grumpy.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:56.150
There's not a better or worse
way to be, right?

00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:57.730
So that people will call
this a set point.

00:25:57.730 --> 00:26:00.570
So of course things happen on
a day-to-day basis, on a

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:02.950
moment-to-moment basis, that
push you up or down in

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:04.440
happiness, of course.

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:06.480
You'll get good news, you get
bad new, you have fearful

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.750
things, joyful things
coming up.

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:11.690
But the idea is that people tend
to get back pretty fast

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:16.220
to the set point, their level,
whatever that is, of chronic,

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:17.450
constant happiness.

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:20.610
And this is kind of an
amazing finding.

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:23.630
So let's take a look at that
and add one more point.

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:27.440
So here's extroverts by
personality measures and

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:27.750
introverts.

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:30.840
And extroverts report themselves
as being happier.

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:34.310
That's a set point example, a
personality thing that seems

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:35.720
to go over time.

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:39.650
But they share the bumpiness
of the week.

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:42.080
Here's how happy they are on
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:45.970
whoa, weekend approaching, and
the misery of Sunday, when the

00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:48.050
weekend is over.

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:51.000
So you can see in both things,
of course they're responding

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000
to the work week cycle of heavy
work, anticipation of

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.290
the weekend, the weekend itself,
and anticipation of

00:26:58.290 --> 00:26:59.970
the work day.

00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:00.990
Both groups do.

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:04.040
But the set points seem to be
a little bit different, the

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:07.700
chronic, constant level.

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:13.960
Now, there's been a bunch of
ideas about a question about

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.630
whether people can
be too happy.

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:18.360
Can a person be too happy?

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.220
And here's what they find.

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.600
That if they had take people
who say, I'm super, super,

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.630
super happy, and you ask them
what's going on their life

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:27.750
that makes some super,
super happy?

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:31.140
Those people often report that
it's close relations to other

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:34.200
people and often, good deeds
or volunteer work, is the

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:37.680
thing that's making them
super, super happy.

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:40.420
A little less happy on average,
but still pretty

00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:44.360
happy, are people who have
higher incomes, higher

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:48.240
education, and more political
participation.

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.190
So look at these two things.

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:52.600
And you could say in your own
life, but all these things

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:53.370
will matter.

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:57.360
But which is the model of
success for you in your heart,

00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:02.360
the human relations and doing
good or the sort of income,

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.990
education, active in
your world thing?

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:06.200
And it's not one is
better than other.

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.530
It's not you have to choose
one or the other.

00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:10.930
But it seems like people
will tend to focus more

00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:11.280
on one or the other.

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.810
All these things are matter.

00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:16.110
But, where you put your heart.

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:16.810
It's easier.

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:18.900
Or you end up doing this,
if you're on the

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:21.380
most extensive happy.

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:24.610
So maybe if you want somebody to
do a certain thing for you,

00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:26.345
you don't want them to be so
happy. they have to a little

00:28:26.345 --> 00:28:28.010
bit grumbling about stuff.

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:29.830
If you think the world is
perfect, you're not going to

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:31.080
fight for political change.

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.800
So what makes us happy?

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:38.410
And it turns out in interesting
ways, it's more

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:40.010
complicated than you think.

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:42.660
And so it's worth thinking
about, because your first

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:45.750
intuitions might not pan out.

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:46.500
So here's an example.

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:48.640
But I want to tell you this,
I'll remind you of this again.

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.620
And then switch to
every day one.

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:54.050
So one part of happiness is that
when we reconstruct what

00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:56.710
made us happy, what made us
happy growing up as a child;

00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:58.920
what made as happy as an
adolescent in high school;

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:02.810
what made us happy last year,
last month, last week, that's

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:03.790
all out of memory.

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:07.590
That's not the current moment
of joy or frustration.

00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:09.800
That's your sense of what
was it all about.

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.850
Where was I in terms
of happiness?

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:17.200
And so Kahneman again did this
work looking at pain ratings

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.450
during a dental procedure.

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:21.550
And he said, what determines
your memory for

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:23.490
how painful it was?

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:28.600
And the two values were the
peak of the pain and the

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.370
ending intensity.

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:34.540
So that if you added a little
extra pain at the end, people

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:35.950
actually rated the
whole session in

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:37.710
memory as less painful.

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:42.950
You add some mild pain at the
end, rate it as painful, but

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:45.400
because it was mild, because the
last number that goes in

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:49.050
their algorithm in their mind
is the strength at the end,

00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:51.310
and the other number seems to be
the peak, he could predict

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:54.010
pretty well how you would
rate the painfulness

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:55.300
of the entire session.

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:58.910
So this shows you that in many
ways, our minds construct our

00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:00.060
definitions of happiness.

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:01.870
They're not simply our
sensory experience.

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:09.370
And here is a thing you could
think about for a moment.

00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:10.860
Many of have had jobs
or something.

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:14.120
You haven't had, most of you,
a long work period on a

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:16.540
consistent basis, most
of you I'm guessing.

00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:20.460
But think about are you happier
at work or vacation?

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:23.680
So if you ask most people are
you happier at work or

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:26.980
vacation, most people
will say vacation.

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:30.350
That's why I work 50 or 51 weeks
of the year to have that

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:31.600
awesome vacation.

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:38.360
If they do a study where you
carry a beeper on you and they

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:41.580
beep you every once in a while,
unexpectedly, and say,

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:43.920
OK, one to seven, how
happy are you?

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.120
And some days you're at the
office and some days you're on

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:48.250
your vacation, what happens?

00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:54.670
You report yourself happier
at work, on average.

00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:56.150
So that's amazing.

00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:57.280
Why do we have vacations
at all?

00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:59.830
Not to be miserable.

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:03.560
I mean could you imagine an ad
that said come to our hotel,

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:05.970
you'll be less miserable
than another

00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:07.190
hotel on your vacation.

00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:09.100
That wouldn't work.

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:10.370
What do think is
going on here?

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:15.910
This is the finding.

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:18.130
What's going on here in the
interpretation is, when we

00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:20.920
think ahead about a vacation or
when we reconstruct in our

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:23.270
mind, there's some things
about it that make

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:26.310
us like it a lot.

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:28.620
When we're on the vacation, and
you may know this, and I

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:30.620
think part of it is the
anticipation of vacation

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:32.860
sometimes, what happens?

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:34.840
The hotel wasn't so good.

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:37.920
You got that food poisoning that
ruined the whole trip.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.980
Your brother or sister were
really a nuisance.

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:41.610
Your parents were a drag.

00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:44.530
Your parents can't understand
why you were so sulky.

00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:47.660
It's was like you didn't have
the space to separate out and

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:51.710
get yourself all sorted out.

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:52.900
I had that too as a kid.

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:55.760
I mean sometimes whatever little
conflicts you had at

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:58.520
home seem to get exaggerated
when you're jammed in

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:00.070
together, for long periods
in cars or

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:01.990
rooms or tents or whatever.

00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:04.800
And then you go that home and in
a couple weeks you go man,

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:06.650
that was an awesome vacation.

00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:07.450
I'll never forget it.

00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:08.690
It means so much to me.

00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:10.700
And it's not that you're
faking it.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:11.820
You really feel that.

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:13.930
Otherwise, you wouldn't get
ready for the next vacation,

00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:15.390
the next year.

00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:18.320
So what this suggests is, in
ourselves, really there's at

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:23.270
least two ways, or two minds,
thinking about happiness.

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:25.490
One is a moment to
moment happiness.

00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:26.700
That's real.

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:29.110
And one is a sort
of big picture,

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:31.700
what is my life about.

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:35.180
And I feel like my life about is
going to interesting places

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:36.480
with people I care about.

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:37.730
That's a vacation.

00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:41.040
It's not that people
are hypocritical.

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:43.390
It's that in them there's these
different dimensions of

00:32:43.390 --> 00:32:46.750
happiness that are tapped by
different moments of thought.

00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:52.790
Happiness researchers, their
most controversial topic,

00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:54.840
because they can explain almost
everything in the story

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:58.370
I just told you, is children.

00:32:58.370 --> 00:33:02.180
So you talk to parents.

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:08.100
And over 33% will say the single
biggest thing that's

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:11.190
the joy in their life is
having children or

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:12.020
grandchildren.

00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:12.930
That's a very common thing.

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:14.900
You could say you're surprised
it's not more.

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:15.800
But still, it's a lot.

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:17.140
It's the single biggest thing.

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:19.820
And I think people really
mostly believe that

00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:21.970
when they say that.

00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:25.270
If you have people keep a
day-to-day diary, the

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:28.930
moment-to-moment source of
happiness, and they rate one

00:33:28.930 --> 00:33:32.237
to seven, everything they just
did, so it's kind of fresh in

00:33:32.237 --> 00:33:39.830
their memory, childcare is rated
just over housework,

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:42.965
below sex, socializing with
friends, watching TV, praying,

00:33:42.965 --> 00:33:46.160
eating, and cooking.

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:50.300
Because again, it's this
weirdness of like, oh, he's

00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:52.110
not doing his homework or
we're afraid she's doing

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:55.820
something or little kids are
just running around, not doing

00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:56.900
what you ask them to do.

00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:00.445
And it's so frustrating because
you can't get them.

00:34:00.445 --> 00:34:02.520
So happiness researchers don't
understand why people have

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:03.070
children at all.

00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:04.020
They can't explain it.

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:05.240
There's a lot of effort
going on to come

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:07.030
up with some formula.

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:09.320
And again, it's not that people
will tell you oh, we

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.310
can't believe we had kids.

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:12.900
How stupid was that?

00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:16.610
They say and they feel, it
is a phenomenal source of

00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:17.440
happiness for them.

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:19.860
It's just when you ask them,
how about five minutes ago?

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:22.469
They go, no.

00:34:22.469 --> 00:34:23.510
Why did he talk that way?

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:25.010
Why doesn't he or she
listen to me?

00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:26.659
Why don't they clean
the room ever?

00:34:26.659 --> 00:34:27.929
They're 25 years old.

00:34:27.929 --> 00:34:30.020
They could make their bed.

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:32.919
Or whatever.

00:34:32.919 --> 00:34:35.370
So it's really interesting,
these two different dimensions

00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:36.150
of happiness.

00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:39.120
So this idea that within us
there's multiple selves, the

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:41.280
moment to moment self,
that's real.

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:43.310
The big picture, what
is my life about?

00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:44.090
That's real.

00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:45.440
They're not always perfectly
aligned.

00:34:49.179 --> 00:34:51.830
In the US, the moment to moment
happiness, in a recent

00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:55.310
study, increases until
about $75,000.

00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:56.080
Of course, it's an average.

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:58.860
Depending on what you need to
buy, that number will move.

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:00.990
But then it tops
out on average.

00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:05.280
But the big picture, emotional
well-being, but overall

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:06.860
satisfaction keeps going
up with income.

00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:09.880
Now, you have to be very
careful on these.

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:11.420
These are all correlations.

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:14.120
Everything I've told you just
about is a correlation.

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:16.380
So when you say overall
satisfaction, sort of big

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:18.920
picture sense of life goes
up with income, is

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:20.560
it really the income?

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:21.810
What else could it be?

00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:31.650
Is it literally the size
of your paycheck?

00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:32.700
Does it have to be that?

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:34.276
Yeah?

00:35:34.276 --> 00:35:34.680
AUDIENCE: Do you think it might
be what kind of job

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:35.235
you're doing?

00:35:35.235 --> 00:35:36.160
PROFESSOR: It might
be the kind of job

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.380
you're doing, on average.

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:39.910
And we know there's phenomenally
important jobs

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:41.500
that are underpaid
in this country.

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:43.020
We know that.

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:45.030
But there's a lot of jobs that
are kind of fun to have, that

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:47.610
are decently paid.

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:50.650
Doctors, lawyers, scientists,
a lot of people find those

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:53.290
jobs to be pretty fulfilling
and pretty decently paid.

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:55.110
And there's other
ones as well.

00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:58.010
All kinds of jobs are decently
paid, that can be fulfilling.

00:35:58.010 --> 00:36:01.570
So it's not necessarily that
it's just about literally

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:04.560
three more dollars and you're
three more dollars happy.

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.530
So these correlations
are very tricky.

00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:10.040
But again, the sense that moment
to moment tops out at

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:12.760
somewhere here, well
above poverty.

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:16.610
But then, big picture keeps
going up somewhere.

00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:19.620
So think for a moment if you
can, just for a moment think

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:24.230
about yourselves five or
10 years from now.

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:26.070
And when you think, if you
can, just for one moment

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:28.790
specifically imagine in your
mind what you might be doing

00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:31.840
five or 10 years from now.

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:33.260
And put your hand up
if you thought of

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:36.210
something pretty positive.

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:38.600
A hope.

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:40.170
Put your hand up now
if you thought of

00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:42.290
something kind of negative.

00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:43.808
Some of you, oh boy.

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:50.960
Most people, our roots claim,
they think about positive

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:54.600
things in the future, other
than fumbling or failing.

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:56.890
So how good are people
at predicting what

00:36:56.890 --> 00:36:57.850
will make them happy?

00:36:57.850 --> 00:36:59.130
How good are people
at predicting

00:36:59.130 --> 00:36:59.790
will make them happy?

00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:01.830
What people call affective
forecasting.

00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:03.400
So I'll give you two examples.

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:05.170
One that's closer to
my life and one

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:07.850
might apply to everybody.

00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:09.430
Actually, I'll tell you
a word about this.

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:12.090
This is a funny story.

00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:14.650
If I don't get tenure,
I will be sad.

00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:15.930
If I get tenure, I
will be happy.

00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:17.390
So you know what tenure
basically is.

00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:19.400
You're given a position, a
faculty position, for a

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:22.010
lifetime, unless you do
something really horrible.

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:26.390
So you can't be fired no matter
what you do almost.

00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:28.600
You get a lot of freedom
from that.

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.380
So on the other hand, what
happens if you don't get

00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:31.990
tenure somewhere?

00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:33.630
Do you know what happens?

00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:35.230
It's not so pleasant,
I could tell you.

00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:37.610
It's not the end of
the world at all.

00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:39.310
But let me just tell you
what know going in.

00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:42.410
What you know going in is your
colleagues are going to meet,

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:43.640
they're going vote.

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:44.730
They're going to say no.

00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:45.290
Which kind of hurts because
you've been

00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:48.720
there five or six years.

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:50.860
And then you have
to leave town.

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:51.840
OK, you don't have
to leave town.

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:53.430
There could be another
university nearby.

00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:55.290
But usually because we're so
super specialized in our

00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:58.480
fields, you have to leave town
and go somewhere else.

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:00.180
And you have to tell your
parents, I didn't get tenure.

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:01.610
And you have to tell your
friends, I didn't get tenure.

00:38:01.610 --> 00:38:03.445
And all your friends who you
know from work, will go, oh,

00:38:03.445 --> 00:38:04.330
I'm sorry you didn't
get tenure.

00:38:04.330 --> 00:38:06.750
For a year, everybody you meet
with goes, I'm sorry you

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:07.780
didn't get tenure.

00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:10.390
So you just don't want that.

00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:13.140
Well, it's a moment I mean.

00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:14.140
None of us want it.

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:17.570
So everybody says, I'd rather
get tenure than not.

00:38:17.570 --> 00:38:20.280
Would you rather win the
lottery, than not?

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:22.450
Sure

00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:24.710
Happiness researchers
love these things.

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:28.030
So it turns out for a couple of
years after you don't get

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:30.600
tenure, and all the negativity,
and leaving town,

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:32.430
and getting another job, and by
the way, some people have

00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:36.260
not gotten tenure and become
amazing superstars, so the

00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:38.540
tenure process is often
incorrect in its evaluation.

00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:40.460
But two years later,
no difference in

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:42.720
happiness at all.

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:45.780
It doesn't really matter
in the long run.

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:48.160
Winning the lottery, a
year or two later,

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:49.550
no difference either.

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:51.490
There's a whole research field
that runs out the minute

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:53.600
somebody wins a big lottery.

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:57.460
And I had a bit of experience
on this, [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:01.470
somebody working in my brother's
house won the single

00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:06.910
largest lottery, at that time,
prize ever, for an individual

00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:07.900
lottery winner in the
United States.

00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:09.230
It's been exceeded since.

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:11.090
It was something like
$187 million.

00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:13.010
And she was definitely
pretty happy.

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:21.690
And she's been I have to say
remarkably wise since then, in

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:25.040
how she's used the money.

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:27.240
And been a very stable
person, kind of.

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:29.870
But there's equal number of
stories of people who get into

00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:31.120
huge trouble.

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:35.610
Actually, the most amazing
story, it's sort of silly to

00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:39.330
share, but I have a relatively
short lecture.

00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:40.650
This was in the news.

00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:42.630
Because you know with the
lottery they say, whoever wins

00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:44.390
this will win the
single largest--

00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:46.010
there's a huge number
of tickets sold.

00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:50.310
And some guy, a taxi driver at
the airport, because all the

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:52.270
news outlets wanted
to cover this.

00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:53.010
And they were trying.

00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:53.690
Who won?

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:53.832
Who won?

00:39:53.832 --> 00:39:54.260
Who won?

00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:55.540
They knew that there
was a winner.

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:57.290
They didn't know who it was.

00:39:57.290 --> 00:40:00.490
And a taxi driver at the airport
supposedly said, I won

00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:00.900
the lottery.

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:01.560
I won the lottery.

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:04.380
Now, we knew he didn't, because
we knew this person

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:05.510
had won it.

00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:07.810
But all the news channels were
running after this person,

00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:10.490
because other cabdrivers
thought he said that.

00:40:10.490 --> 00:40:13.560
And then apparently, all the
people he owed money were

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:15.410
hunting him down.

00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:19.420
And he had to hire a lawyer to
sort of fight off people.

00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:21.370
And so he was really
miserable.

00:40:21.370 --> 00:40:25.190
And it was really sad, weird
thing to be the lottery winner

00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:27.480
who didn't get the lottery, but
everybody thought you did.

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:29.400
And there's other stories in
towns, these are amazing

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.960
stories if you follow it, where
they know somebody won

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:32.820
the lottery in the town.

00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:34.850
But the person doesn't
have to come forward.

00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:36.810
And then you get all this weird
stuff, because other

00:40:36.810 --> 00:40:39.470
people start to guess who really
has a ton of money

00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:40.590
amongst them.

00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:41.920
And they have wrong guesses.

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:44.100
And they go and say like, my
mother needs medical surgery.

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:44.670
Won't you help me?

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:47.200
And the person doesn't have the
money or maybe that one

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:48.340
does, but most don't.

00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:49.340
There's only one.

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:52.760
And so the whole town gets into
huge fights and misery

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:54.900
because they are assuming that
somebody could do amazing

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:56.510
things for everybody, but
they're just being mean

00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:57.780
in not doing it.

00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:00.830
And 90% of their guesses of
who that is are wrong.

00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:01.890
More than you want to know
about lotteries.

00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:04.010
But I can tell you that on
average, a year or two later,

00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:04.660
no difference.

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:05.660
So it's amazing.

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:07.290
You would think that
would make my life,

00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:08.600
if I won the lottery.

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:10.970
And probably it does in
terms of plasma TVs.

00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:15.650
But in terms of self-rated
happiness, no difference.

00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:18.500
And here's a more amazing thing
in certain way, although

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:22.450
if you talk to patients,
not as amazing.

00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:24.850
If you have a unexpected
accident leading to

00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:28.840
quadriplegia or paraplegia, so
you really can't get around,

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:32.870
return to typical ratings of
happiness in three months.

00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:37.380
So we're incredibly unable to
predict, because we would have

00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:40.540
all kinds of ideas about how
long these would brutalize our

00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:41.870
sense of happiness.

00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:43.680
And we're wrong, wrong, wrong.

00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:46.950
We don't know how to predict
what will make us happy.

00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:52.660
And some people call
this hedonic

00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:54.470
adaptation or a set point.

00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:55.980
That you go back to your
set point over

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:57.880
an incredible range.

00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:58.640
You do respond.

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:00.180
But you go back to it
over an incredible

00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:01.850
range of life outcomes.

00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:03.950
So there's a small experiment
compared to these things, but

00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:05.970
a controlled experiment.

00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:08.220
Dan Gilbert at Harvard, who's
done amazing work in this

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:11.100
area, he had Harvard students in
a photography class choose

00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:14.350
their two favorite pictures
from the entire class.

00:42:14.350 --> 00:42:16.860
And they were told they have to
give one to their teacher

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:18.510
and they can keep one.

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:19.560
And there were two conditions.

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:21.950
In one condition, once they
gave that picture to their

00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:23.900
teacher, that was it.

00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:27.490
In the other condition,
they could change the

00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:29.490
picture in a few days.

00:42:29.490 --> 00:42:31.750
Now, you know in all this
course, every time you think

00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:34.560
A, go opposite B, right?

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:37.770
But if you weren't an amazingly
sophisticated

00:42:37.770 --> 00:42:40.650
psychologist at this point, if
you were just a person on the

00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:43.660
street, which do you think would
sound better, having no

00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:45.580
choice or having the possibility
of exchanging the

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:47.460
picture, if you want to,
in a couple of days?

00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:48.110
It's a choice.

00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:49.850
We like choice, right?

00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:50.240
No.

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:53.315
The people who are happier are
the people who say once hand

00:42:53.315 --> 00:42:54.950
me the picture, that's to me.

00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:56.220
These people are standing around
going, I don't know.

00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:56.630
I don't know.

00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:57.450
Where am I going to
be happier, this

00:42:57.450 --> 00:42:58.310
picture or that picture?

00:42:58.310 --> 00:42:58.600
I don't know.

00:42:58.600 --> 00:42:58.645
I don't know.

00:42:58.645 --> 00:43:00.110
I can't tell.

00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:03.730
Also once it's an irrevocable
choice, what amazing human

00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:05.580
thing comes into play
that helps us feel

00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:07.600
good about our lives?

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:09.610
Cognitive dissonance.

00:43:09.610 --> 00:43:11.220
Did I pick the right picture?

00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:12.580
That teachers is a sucker.

00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:13.940
I thought they were
the two best.

00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:17.050
But the one that teacher took,
oh, that was pretty bad.

00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:20.850
I can't believe how lucky I am
that irrevocably I ended up

00:43:20.850 --> 00:43:22.180
with this picture.

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:25.590
The person who has days to do
this, they can't let cognitive

00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:28.390
dissonance come in and
fix up their choice.

00:43:31.006 --> 00:43:34.470
The paradox of choice, why
choices can be painful.

00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:35.480
So again, we like choice.

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:36.860
I like choice.

00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:38.120
There's an experiment.

00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:42.170
People say, you go into a
typical big grocery store, 285

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:45.390
cookie choices, 13 sports
drinks, 75 ice teas, 200

00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:47.160
channels and more, on cable.

00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:52.850
So they did an experiment in
Palo Alto, Stanford's group,

00:43:52.850 --> 00:43:54.120
in a gourmet food store.

00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:55.900
They had exotic, high-quality
jams.

00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:57.420
And you could taste some jams.

00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:00.620
And then get a coupon for $1
off if you buy the jam.

00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:02.530
So a typical kind of
thing you might see

00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:04.500
sometimes in grocery stores.

00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:10.030
And they would have you taste
either six jams or up to 24.

00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:12.490
Now, most people didn't
do 24 jams.

00:44:12.490 --> 00:44:14.850
Because you wouldn't want to
have that many, even single

00:44:14.850 --> 00:44:15.680
tastes of a jam.

00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:19.200
But you'll try a few, at
a table like this.

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:21.420
So first of all, here's
the two tables.

00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:22.580
Six jams or 24.

00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:24.540
More shoppers came to
the table of 24.

00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:25.985
Well, you see 24
jams out there.

00:44:25.985 --> 00:44:27.370
It's kind of impressive.

00:44:27.370 --> 00:44:28.950
Like there's got be something
I like there.

00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:29.770
What's going on?

00:44:29.770 --> 00:44:33.300
So more people are drawn to
the big choice department.

00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:35.590
Now when they get there, they
only have about five jams.

00:44:35.590 --> 00:44:36.680
These people have about six.

00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:39.260
So it's about the same number
of jams that you taste.

00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:41.500
Big display, lots of choice.

00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:42.880
Limited choice.

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:45.130
What happens in your
actual behavior?

00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:48.020
Well, at the six-jam table,
30% of the people

00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:50.290
purchased the jam.

00:44:50.290 --> 00:44:54.280
If there's a 24-jam table, only
3% made the purchases.

00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:55.760
So what do you think happened?

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:56.650
We don't know for sure.

00:44:56.650 --> 00:44:57.790
This is the actual behavior.

00:44:57.790 --> 00:45:02.860
Exactly the opposite, more
choices among jams led to less

00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:04.860
purchases of jams.

00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:06.270
What's your guess as
to what happened?

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:07.074
Yeah?

00:45:07.074 --> 00:45:08.702
AUDIENCE: They people who liked
[INAUDIBLE] with 24

00:45:08.702 --> 00:45:09.740
jams, were in a jam.

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:10.320
PROFESSOR: Were what?

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:11.510
AUDIENCE: They're in a jam.

00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:12.320
PROFESSOR: They're in a jam.

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:12.790
That's pretty good.

00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:13.490
They were in a jam.

00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:13.820
Yes.

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:16.070
And because what?

00:45:16.070 --> 00:45:18.010
Because I tried five or six,
it's all I could try.

00:45:18.010 --> 00:45:19.560
But there's another
20 out there.

00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:21.690
And they could be awesome
beyond belief.

00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:23.950
And I'm not going to commit.

00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:26.250
Because there could be some
awesome jam around the corner.

00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:27.820
And I've only tried
five or six.

00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:29.420
So they're overwhelmed.

00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:31.270
Instead of happily getting
a jam, they're

00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:32.410
jammed up as you said.

00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:33.350
Ah, ah.

00:45:33.350 --> 00:45:35.790
And they go, um, who can begin
to figure out what's the right

00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:36.430
jam for me.

00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:38.320
It's just a way too big.

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:41.160
So all those choices make them
less likely to make a

00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:42.140
purchase than this.

00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:44.210
Exactly the opposite of what
might intuitively-- too many

00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:45.460
choices are burdensome.

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:50.180
Calling plans.

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:51.920
I don't know if you've ever
tried to compare calling plans

00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:55.170
across phone services.

00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:57.210
You sit down for a few moments
and you just give up.

00:45:57.210 --> 00:45:59.960
Maybe you don't.

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:01.870
Health insurance things,
retirement plans.

00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:03.520
You just get all these
complicated menus.

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:04.890
And a lot of people
just give up.

00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:06.870
And they just go like,
what's the cheapest?

00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:08.910
What do most people do?

00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:12.470
Because it's just too
hard to figure out.

00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:17.340
So when they do surveys of
asking people what people

00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:19.440
think will make them
happy, these are

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:21.340
the most common answers.

00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:24.230
If I get into a relationship
or a marriage that I like.

00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:25.750
If I have more flexibility
at work.

00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:27.810
Getting a baby, if that's
what you want.

00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:30.140
Losing weight, cure of a chronic
disease, making more

00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:32.890
money, having more time,
advancing in beauty.

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:34.170
OK, this is the list.

00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:38.820
It's not surprising
list, right?

00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:41.910
What would make you
more happy?

00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:45.800
And again, we know that
happiness set

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:47.130
points are about 50%.

00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:51.260
10% estimated the circumstances,
like poverty.

00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:52.550
Things that you can't
help in your life.

00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:53.670
Just can't help.

00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:56.870
But happiness researchers are
trying to make the case that

00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:59.760
about 40% of our happiness
depends on what

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:01.450
we choose to do.

00:47:01.450 --> 00:47:03.120
So that's a big piece.

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:05.640
It's a big piece.

00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:09.050
We can't help some things, in
our genes or in our global

00:47:09.050 --> 00:47:09.600
environment.

00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:11.240
But it's almost half.

00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:12.070
And these are estimates.

00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:12.880
Maybe it's more.

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:14.400
But this is the current
estimate.

00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:19.340
And research, over and over
again, shows that it's wrong

00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:21.850
to think that happiness
is found.

00:47:21.850 --> 00:47:22.510
Like you get there.

00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:24.820
And here I am, happy.

00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:26.190
That it's changing in
your circumstances.

00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:27.170
I move in a city.

00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:28.140
I get a promotion.

00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:29.140
I meet another person.

00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:30.690
That's the happiness.

00:47:30.690 --> 00:47:32.730
And that you either have
it or you don't.

00:47:32.730 --> 00:47:34.640
I'm just a person
who's not happy.

00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:39.090
All these things, the objective
evidence is against.

00:47:39.090 --> 00:47:43.540
And here's what researchers find
goes with, in experiments

00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:45.010
and in correlations.

00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:48.240
Here's their list, from an
objective evidence as they can

00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:50.040
get, in this kind of work.

00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:52.230
Time nurturing relations with
family and friends comes out

00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:55.980
as the number one thing
that plays out.

00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:58.950
Expressing gratitude
and helping others.

00:47:58.950 --> 00:48:01.470
Whole experiments were if you
just did something nice,

00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:02.835
people feel awesome.

00:48:02.835 --> 00:48:06.050
I heard a Berkeley psychologist
say, just try to

00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:08.910
feel unhappy after you
just expressed

00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:10.770
gratitude or helped somebody.

00:48:10.770 --> 00:48:12.650
And you can't even do it.

00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:14.260
I don't know if that's
quite true.

00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:16.680
But experiments have shown
that when you have people

00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:19.090
express gratitude or do
something to help others,

00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:21.760
their happiness ratings
will zoom right up.

00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:24.550
Practicing optimism about the
future, savoring life in the

00:48:24.550 --> 00:48:28.360
present, physical exercise,
commitment to lifelong goals

00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:29.160
and ambitions.

00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:32.900
A sense that you have a path
that make sense to you, as

00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:35.620
opposed to sort of bumping
around from opportunity and

00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:36.770
opportunity.

00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:40.420
And something about, having
an approach to coping or

00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:43.800
resilience when bad
things happen.

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:45.990
I'm sure in some of your lives,
heartbreaking, bad

00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:47.490
things have happened.

00:48:47.490 --> 00:48:49.440
Most of us get some of them.

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:53.420
Many of us get every day things
that we struggle with.

00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:57.520
And the path by which we deal
with adversity, huge influence

00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:00.770
on self-reported happiness.

00:49:00.770 --> 00:49:05.380
So again, so this is
my final slide.

00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:09.930
And I hope that this course,
you guys have made me happy

00:49:09.930 --> 00:49:10.580
throughout this course.

00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:13.240
I've have incredibly pleasurable
lunches and

00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:18.090
dinners and brunches with
students from the course.

00:49:18.090 --> 00:49:19.890
This is just stunning for me.

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:22.420
And it's really moving.

00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:25.560
And I'm just very grateful
to have had the chance to

00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:27.370
introduce you to these ideas.

00:49:27.370 --> 00:49:29.120
Have a OK exam period.

00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:30.480
You have to get through that.

00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:31.630
Bounce back and cope.

00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:32.090
And have a great summer.

00:49:32.090 --> 00:49:33.340
Thanks very much.
