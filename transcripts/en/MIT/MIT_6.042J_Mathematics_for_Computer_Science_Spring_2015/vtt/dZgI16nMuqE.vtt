00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.380
PROFESSOR: Another way to talk
about congruence and remainder

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.644
arithmetic is to work
strictly with remainders,

00:00:05.644 --> 00:00:08.060
which makes things a little
simpler because you don't have

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.476
to worry about the fact that
the product of two remainders

00:00:10.476 --> 00:00:12.832
may, for example, be too
big to be a remainder.

00:00:12.832 --> 00:00:14.290
To knock it back
in range, you have

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.790
to take the remainder again.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.000
And that's what
this abstract idea

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.240
of the ring of integers
modulo n, the ring Z sub n,

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.280
captures in a quite elegant way.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.660
So it's going to allow us to
talk strictly about equality

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.980
instead of congruence.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.490
And let's remind ourselves that
the basic idea behind working

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.760
with a remainder arithmetic
was that every time we

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.210
got a number that was too
big to be a remainder,

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.430
we just hit it with
the remainder operation

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.530
again to bring it back in range.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.010
And so the operations in
Zn work exactly that way.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.820
The elements of Zn
are the remainders.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.890
That is, the numbers from
0, including 0, up to n,

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:57.880
but not including n.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.760
So there are n of them from
0, 1, up through n minus 1.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.190
And the definitions of
the operations in Zn

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.489
are given right here.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.320
Addition just
means take this sum

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.790
but then take the
remainder immediately,

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.250
just in case it's too big.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.200
And likewise, the product in
Zn is simply multiply them

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.710
and take the remainder.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.090
This isn't really a
very dramatic idea,

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.642
but it turns out to pay off
in making some things just

00:01:23.642 --> 00:01:25.350
a little bit easier
to say, because we're

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.080
talking about equality
instead of congruence.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.100
So this package together,
this mathematical structure

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.750
consisting of the integers
in this interval--

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.640
remember this notation,
square bracket

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.480
means inclusive and round
parenthesis means exclusive.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.850
So this includes zero,
it doesn't include n.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.280
The integers in that
interval, under the operations

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.070
of plus and times modulo
Zn, as defined here,

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.170
is called the ring
of integers Zn.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.880
So it's got two
operations and a bunch

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.400
of things that are operated on.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.200
Now I guess it's
worth highlighting.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.330
That's what Zn is,
the ring of integers.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.780
Mod n, or modulo n.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.330
Now, arithmetic in Zn is really
just arithmetic-- congruence

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.110
arithmetic, except that
it's equality now instead

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.330
of congruence.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.970
So we can say, for example,
in Z7 that 3 plus 6

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.800
is literally equal to 2
because, well, 3 plus 6 is 9,

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.550
the remainder on
division by 7 is 2,

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.570
and we go directly
to the two in Zn,

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.651
suppressing the mention of
taking remainders and not even

00:02:33.651 --> 00:02:35.650
really having to think
about it, which is what's

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.880
helpful about working with Zn.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.860
Likewise, 9 times 8 is
literally equal to 6 in Z11.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.360
So what's the connection between
the set of all the integers

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.700
and the integers mod n?

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.470
And we can state this
abstractly in the following way.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.980
Let's just, for convenience,
abbreviate the remainder of k

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.160
on division by n as R of k.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.550
So n is fixed.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.990
And what's the connection
between Z and Zn?

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.550
Well, it's fairly simple.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.420
If you take the
remainder of i plus j,

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.970
that's literally equal
to taking the sum

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.356
of the remainders in Zn.

00:03:14.356 --> 00:03:15.730
Once you've taken
the remainders,

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.420
you're in the range of
numbers that Zn works with.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.030
And this sum, then, keeps
you in on the Zn side.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.760
Likewise, if you
take the remainder

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.170
of a product of real
integers, that's

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.140
literally equal to the product
of the remainders in Zn.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.940
This operation, by the
way, this connection

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.020
between mathematical
structures, the structure

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.220
of the integers
under plus and times

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.640
and Zn under plus and times,
is called a homomorphism.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.570
R, in this case, is defining
a homomorphism from Z to Zn.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.432
That's a basic
concept in algebra

00:03:46.432 --> 00:03:47.890
that you'll learn
more about if you

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.670
take some courses in algebra,
but I'm just mentioning it

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:51.660
for cultural reasons.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.980
We're not going to
exploit it any further,

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.970
or look further into this idea.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.446
OK.

00:03:57.446 --> 00:03:59.320
What's the connection
between equivalence mod

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.684
n, or congruence mod n, and Zn?

00:04:01.684 --> 00:04:02.725
Well, it's fairly simple.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.660
In Zn, we convert
congruences into equalities.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.640
So i is congruent to j mod
n if and only if r of i

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.880
is equal to r of j in Zn.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.140
And this is just a
rephrasing of the fact

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.570
that two numbers
are congruent if

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.080
and only if they have
the same remainder.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.250
Now once you've got this
self-contained system Zn,

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.540
you can start talking
about algebraic rules

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.710
that it satisfies.

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.860
And now, they hold with equality
and they're pretty familiar.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.170
So let's look at some of
the rules for addition,

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.730
for example, that
hold true in Zn.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.540
First of all, addition
is associative.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.150
i plus j plus k is
i plus j plus k.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.350
We have an identity
element, literally zero.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.100
Zero plus any i is i.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.100
We have a minus operation, an
inverse operation, with respect

00:04:53.100 --> 00:05:03.020
to addition, which is that--
how do I get back some slides?

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.520
Excuse me.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.580
OK, let's keep going.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.830
I have an inverse operation,
which is that for every i,

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.460
there's an element
called minus i.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.200
It's additive inverse such
that if you add i and minus i,

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.680
you get zero.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.310
And finally,
commutativity, which

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.100
is that i plus j is
the same as j plus i.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.110
You don't really need
to memorize these names,

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.940
but you will probably
hear them a lot

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.060
in various other contexts, and
especially in algebra courses,

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.800
but even in terms of arithmetic.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.720
These are some of the basic
rules that addition satisfies.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.306
And in fact,
multiplication satisfies

00:05:34.306 --> 00:05:35.430
pretty much the same rules.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.340
Multiplication is
likewise associative.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.840
There's an identity for
multiplication called 1.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.110
1 times i is i.

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.900
Multiplication is
also commutative.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.290
The one obvious omission
here is inverses.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:52.480
You can't count on there
being inverses in Zn.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.650
And finally,
there's an operation

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.740
that connects addition
and multiplication called

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.710
distributivity.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.890
Namely, i times j
plus k is ij plus ik,

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.450
as you well know from
ordinary arithmetic.

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:11.086
And this rule works fine for
remainders and working in Zn.

00:06:11.086 --> 00:06:12.960
As I said, the one thing
we have to watch out

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.543
for, it shouldn't
be a surprise, is we

00:06:14.543 --> 00:06:17.570
know that you can't cancel with
respect to congruence mod n.

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.540
And that's reflected in the fact
that you can't cancel in Zn.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:26.740
Namely, in Z12, for example, 3
times 2 is equal to 2 times 8.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.900
Again, 3 times 2 is
6, 2 times 8 is 16,

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.570
you immediately take the
remainder to get back to 6.

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.260
In Z12, these two
things are equal.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.960
But if you tried to cancel the
2, you'd conclude that 3 was 8,

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.870
and neither 3-- 3 and
8 are different numbers

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:45.110
in the range from 0 to 12,
and they're different in Z12.

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.210
So you can't cancel 2.

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:48.190
OK.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:50.850
Now the rules that we
already figured out

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:52.640
for when you can
cancel in congruence

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.090
translate directly over to
when you can cancel in Zn.

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.610
And now there's a
standard abbreviation

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.000
that's useful to use here.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.310
If I write Zn*, what I mean
is the elements in Zn that are

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.420
relatively prime to n.

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:09.320
The elements whose
GCD with n is 1.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:16.670
So what we have is the following
equivalent formulations of Zn*,

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.300
which correspond to the facts
we've already figured out about

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:19.800
congruence.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:25.280
Namely, an integer i in the
range from 0 to n is in Zn*

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.300
if and only if the
GCD of i and n is 1,

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:32.780
or i is cancelable in Zn,
or i has an inverse in Zn.

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:34.720
All of these three
things are equivalent.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:40.260
They give you the sense that
Zn* is a kind of robust subset

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.830
of Zn that you'd want
to be thinking about.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:46.730
And in fact, it's very valuable
to be paying attention to.

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:48.870
What else do we know about Zn*?

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:52.070
Well, the definition of
phi of n was the number

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:54.720
of integers in the
interval from 0

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.940
to n that are
relatively prime to n.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:00.870
Of course, that's
exactly the size of Zn*.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:04.980
So phi of n is simply the size
of that collection of elements.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:05.680
Not surprising.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.400
They were defined that way.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.152
So now I can restate
Euler's Theorem

00:08:09.152 --> 00:08:10.360
in a slightly convenient way.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.600
Instead of mentioning
congruence,

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.933
we can just talk about equality.

00:08:12.933 --> 00:08:16.990
Euler's Theorem says that if you
raise a number k to the power

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:20.570
phi of n, it's literally
equal to 1 in Zn,

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:23.980
at least for those k's that
are relatively prime to n.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.600
That is, those k's
that are in Zn*.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.630
And it's going to turn out that
the proof of Euler's Theorem

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:31.630
is actually pretty easy.

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:33.129
It just follows in
a couple of steps

00:08:33.129 --> 00:08:34.700
from a couple of
simple observations.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.159
So let's start on those.

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:40.270
So the first remark is that if I
have any subset, S, of elements

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:43.720
in Zn-- I don't care whether
they are relatively prime to n

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:47.180
or not-- if I multiply
each of them by k,

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.110
this notation for
k times S means

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:54.290
that I'm taking the set of
elements that are of the form

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:57.750
k times an element of S
over all the elements of S.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:01.000
So kS, which is this
set of multiples

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.930
of k-- multiples of
elements of S by k,

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:07.330
has exactly the same size as S.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:08.120
Now, why is that?

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.880
Well, this of course is only
true for k that are cancelable.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.895
But the Lemma is, no matter
what subset you take of Zn,

00:09:15.895 --> 00:09:19.060
if you multiplied every
one of them by an element

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:23.550
that's cancelable in Zn*, you
get a set of the same size.

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:28.470
And that's clear because how
could ks1 and ks2 be equal?

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:30.526
Well, only if s1
and s2 were equal.

00:09:30.526 --> 00:09:32.150
Or another way to
say it is that if you

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:35.730
had different elements
in S, s1 not equal to s2,

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:37.870
when you multiply
them by k, you have

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:42.780
to get different elements of
ks, because k is cancelable.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:43.280
OK.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.410
So that's an easy remark.

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:46.030
Holds in general.

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:50.690
Multiply any subset by
a cancelable element,

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:53.960
and you get a new set
that's the same size.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.400
The second remark is that if
you look at numbers i and j that

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:01.340
are in the interval
from 0 to n in Zn,

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:06.660
then if you multiply
the two of them,

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:11.650
then you're going to get an
element in Zn* if and only

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:14.052
if the original two
elements were in Zn*.

00:10:14.052 --> 00:10:16.510
Well, let's just look at it in
the left to right direction,

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:17.980
which is the only one we need.

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:22.830
If i and j are
relatively prime to Zn*,

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:26.910
then so is their product,
because if neither i nor j has

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:30.480
a prime factor in common with
n, then their product obviously

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:34.130
doesn't have a factor
in common with n.

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:35.600
And then when you
take remainders,

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.330
it's still going to be a
number whose GCD is the same.

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.960
And so we have this
remark that if you

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.180
multiply two
cancelable elements,

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:45.490
you get a cancelable element.

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:48.290
If you multiply two elements
relatively prime to Zn*,

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:49.620
you get an element of Zn*.

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:52.640
There's about-- every one
of these formulations of Zn*

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:56.290
in terms of GCDs are
cancelable or inverse,

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:58.800
and each of them gives a
separate and straightforward

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.720
proof of the fact that
if i and j are in Zn*,

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:02.937
then so is their product.

00:11:02.937 --> 00:11:04.520
Now it's worth
mentioning, by the way,

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.590
that, in general,
their sum is not.

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:12.160
If you add two elements that
are relatively prime to Zn*,

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.910
even if their sum is non-zero,
you will typically get

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:21.050
an element that is no longer
relatively prime to n.

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:22.910
But for multiplication,
it works great,

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:25.580
and that's what matters to us.

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:26.080
OK.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.470
So as a corollary of this is
that I can actually conclude

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:32.340
that, if I choose an
element that's cancelable,

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:36.110
an element in Zn*, if I
take the whole set Zn*,

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:38.780
all those elements that
are relatively prime to n,

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:43.460
and I take multiples of k by
each of them, then, in fact,

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:46.260
I get the same set, Zn*.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:52.140
And the proof of that is
really straightforward.

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:53.716
Let's think about
it for a minute.

00:11:53.716 --> 00:11:55.590
Because what do I know
is that these two sets

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:57.050
are the same size.

00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:00.060
kZn* and Zn* are the same size.

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:02.890
As long as k is cancelable, I
don't even care that this was

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:05.030
Zn*.

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:08.810
On the other hand,
if k is in Zn*,

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:12.940
k times Zn* only gives
you elements in Zn*.

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:17.180
So kZn* is a subset
of the left-hand side,

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:20.220
and it's the same size by
the Lemma that says that

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:22.900
multiplying by k
preserves sizes.

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:24.540
So they have to be equal.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:27.670
So basically what that means
is that if you take all

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:31.230
the elements in Z*, all the
elements relatively prime to n,

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:34.600
and you take another one of
them, pick one out of that set,

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:39.280
and multiply every element
in the set by that element k,

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.170
if you had them lined up
in one order beforehand,

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:45.220
when you multiplied by k you
get exactly the same elements

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.100
but just reordered.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.620
That is, multiplying by k
has the effect of permuting

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:54.410
the elements of Zn*.

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:55.750
Let's look at an example.

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:57.700
So let's look at Z9.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.900
And we know that phi of 9,
by the previous formula,

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:02.490
is 3 squared minus 3, or 6.

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:05.840
There are going to be 6 elements
from 0 to n that are relatively

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:10.060
prime to 9, and
that comprise Zn*.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:11.740
So let's look at what they are.

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:13.580
So you can do-- check
the calculation.

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:18.447
But Zn* is exactly the
elements 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8.

00:13:18.447 --> 00:13:20.280
We know we got them all
because there's only

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.696
supposed to be six
of them, and we

00:13:21.696 --> 00:13:24.460
can check that those are
all relatively prime to 9.

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.720
None of them has 3 as a divisor.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.840
Now what happens, for example,
if I multiply them all by 2?

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.210
Two is another good
number-- it's right here--

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:33.790
that's in Zn*.

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:35.850
And multiplying them by
2, well, let's check.

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:39.750
2 times 1 is 2, 2 times
2 is 4, 2 times 4 is 8,

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:45.060
2 times 5 is 1-- because it's 10
with a remainder of 1-- 2 times

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:47.940
7 is 14-- translates
into 5-- 2 times 8

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:51.140
is 16-- [INAUDIBLE]
translates into 7.

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:52.720
And, as claimed, look at this.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.350
Here's 2, 4, 8, 1, 5, 7.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:58.580
It's the same numbers
as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8,

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:00.070
just in a different order.

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:02.040
Let's do one more example.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.840
Let's try multiplying by 7.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.130
That's another respectable
element over here.

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:14.331
7 times 1 is 7, 7 times 2 is
14, which means it's 5 in Z9.

00:14:14.331 --> 00:14:15.850
4 times 7 is 28.

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:20.490
Well, 3 times 7 is 27, so
that leaves a remainder of 1.

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:22.590
And 4 times 7 is 1 in Z9.

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:27.050
Likewise, 5 times 7 is 8, 7
times 7 is 4, and 7 times 8

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:30.240
is 56, which translates to 2.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:34.130
And sure enough, as claimed, I
see the same numbers, 7, 5, 1,

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:38.390
8, 4, 2, just these
numbers scrambled in order.

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:43.220
They're permuted, which is the
outcome of multiplying by 7.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:44.640
OK.

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.410
So let's go back.

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:48.930
What we've just illustrated is
this fact that we've already

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:53.900
concluded that, if you take
Zn* and you multiply it

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:57.320
by an element k in Zn*, you
get the same set in a different

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:57.820
order.

00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:02.450
So Zn* is equal to k times Zn*.

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:05.920
And now we're on the brink
of proving Euler's Theorem.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.890
Because what I want
to do is say, look,

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:09.430
these two sets are the same.

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:12.390
Let's multiply all the
elements on the left

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:15.290
together, and multiply all the
elements on the right together.

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:17.780
Let's take the product
of those elements.

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:22.940
So let's take the product of Zn*
and compare it to the product

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:24.260
of kZn*.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.870
So big pi here is
indicating the product

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:29.580
of all of the elements in
this set, the product of all

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:31.320
of the elements in this set.

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:35.420
Well, let's look at
the set on the right.

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:39.950
This is the product of k
times all the elements in Z*.

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:41.610
Well how many
elements are there?

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:44.510
Phi of n elements in
Z*, by definition.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:47.090
And let's factor
out all the k's.

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:51.500
So this expression here, the
product of k times each element

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:56.100
in Zn*, is the same as the
product of the elements in Zn*

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:59.380
times k to as many
elements as there were,

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:00.690
namely k to the phi of n.

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:03.150
I'm just factoring k
out of this product.

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:05.070
And there's my k
to the phi of n.

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:06.840
And now look what I got here.

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:10.250
That's pi Zn*,
and that's pi Zn*.

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:13.620
What do I know about
multiplying elements in Zn*?

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:15.330
They're in Zn*.

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:18.440
This product will be some
other element is Zn*.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.750
So will this product.

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:21.720
But what do I know about Zn*?

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:23.210
They're cancelable.

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:26.520
So just looking-- ignoring
the middle term now,

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:29.660
what I'm concluding is that the
product of Zn* is k to the phi

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:31.440
of n times the product of Zn*.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.830
Let's cancel those
cancelable terms.

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:34.730
And I'm done.

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:36.500
I've just figured
out that 1, which

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.520
is the result of canceling
the term on the left,

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:41.440
is equal to k to the phi of n.

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:45.850
And we have successfully
proved Euler's Theorem,

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:49.270
which is what we were
aiming for in this segment.
