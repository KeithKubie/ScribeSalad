there their focus you just let them give
 

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.630
there their focus you just let them give
them a bunch of stuff and then they

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:31.640
them a bunch of stuff and then they
 

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.550

thing that I think's interesting for me

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:31.640
thing that I think's interesting for me
 

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.820
thing that I think's interesting for me
for you guys is you actually started on

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:33.830
for you guys is you actually started on
 

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:36.520
for you guys is you actually started on
the YouTube API is very early yes so you

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:36.530
the YouTube API is very early yes so you
 

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:39.670
the YouTube API is very early yes so you
guys have transitioned from v1 to v2 to

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:39.680
guys have transitioned from v1 to v2 to
 

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.920
guys have transitioned from v1 to v2 to
v3 correct yeah we've seen it all and

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:41.930
v3 correct yeah we've seen it all and
 

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:43.990
v3 correct yeah we've seen it all and
yeah it's been an amazing right we've

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.000
yeah it's been an amazing right we've
 

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.850
yeah it's been an amazing right we've
probably uploaded about million videos

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:45.860
probably uploaded about million videos
 

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.760
probably uploaded about million videos
from our users on their YouTube channels

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:48.770
from our users on their YouTube channels
 

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:51.310
from our users on their YouTube channels
and so we've had volume and we've had

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:51.320
and so we've had volume and we've had
 

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:54.970
and so we've had volume and we've had
the history of building on top of those

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:54.980
the history of building on top of those
 

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:57.910
the history of building on top of those
so from that experience I guess do you

00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:57.920
so from that experience I guess do you
 

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.860
so from that experience I guess do you
guys have any for people that are new

00:11:59.860 --> 00:11:59.870
guys have any for people that are new
 

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:01.570
guys have any for people that are new
and starting on the new our new API

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:01.580
and starting on the new our new API
 

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:04.240
and starting on the new our new API
which is v 3 version 3 do you have any

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:04.250
which is v 3 version 3 do you have any
 

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:06.610
which is v 3 version 3 do you have any
like things you like to point out for

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:06.620
like things you like to point out for
 

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:08.050
like things you like to point out for
them to get started maybe lessons you've

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:08.060
them to get started maybe lessons you've
 

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:11.200
them to get started maybe lessons you've
learned along the way sure yeah going

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:11.210
learned along the way sure yeah going
 

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:16.450
learned along the way sure yeah going
from v2 to v3 isn't a big deal it's it's

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:16.460
from v2 to v3 isn't a big deal it's it's
 

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:18.700
from v2 to v3 isn't a big deal it's it's
much easier than the transition from v1

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:18.710
much easier than the transition from v1
 

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:24.850
much easier than the transition from v1
to v2 you expectations there is a better

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:24.860
to v2 you expectations there is a better
 

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:27.610
to v2 you expectations there is a better
means a smaller error rate which is

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:27.620
means a smaller error rate which is
 

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:29.050
means a smaller error rate which is
important for us because we do a lot of

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:29.060
important for us because we do a lot of
 

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.060
important for us because we do a lot of
those and so when there is an upload

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:31.070
those and so when there is an upload
 

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:33.550
those and so when there is an upload
failure then that that looks bad from

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:33.560
failure then that that looks bad from
 

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.590
failure then that that looks bad from
from from the users perspective and one

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:35.600
from from the users perspective and one
 

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.420
from from the users perspective and one
of the cool things that we can do now is

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:37.430
of the cool things that we can do now is
 

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:39.430
of the cool things that we can do now is
resumable upload so if there is a

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:39.440
resumable upload so if there is a
 

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.380
resumable upload so if there is a
network failure sometime during the

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:41.390
network failure sometime during the
 

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:43.210
network failure sometime during the
uploading of a video then we can resume

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:43.220
uploading of a video then we can resume
 

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:45.970
uploading of a video then we can resume
that video and have a successful

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:45.980
that video and have a successful
 

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:48.700
that video and have a successful
experience for the user so that's really

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:48.710
experience for the user so that's really
 

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:52.660
experience for the user so that's really
cool another cool thing that's maybe not

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:52.670
cool another cool thing that's maybe not
 

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:55.300
cool another cool thing that's maybe not
specific to v3 or obvious but that is

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:55.310
specific to v3 or obvious but that is
 

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:57.340
