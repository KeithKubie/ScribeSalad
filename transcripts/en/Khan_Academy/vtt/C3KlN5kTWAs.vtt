00:00:00.137 --> 00:00:02.633
Male voiceover: If a commodities
trader would tell you

00:00:02.633 --> 00:00:05.119
that a market is in Contango,

00:00:05.119 --> 00:00:07.666
they're just referring to the idea

00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:09.473
that it is cheaper today.

00:00:09.473 --> 00:00:11.137
So if we're talking about now,

00:00:11.137 --> 00:00:14.196
it's cheaper to buy that
commodity on the Spot Market.

00:00:14.196 --> 00:00:17.002
It's cheaper to buy it on the Spot Market

00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:21.054
than it is to agree to buy
it at some futures date

00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:24.913
or some future date using a
Futures or Forward Contract.

00:00:24.913 --> 00:00:29.471
In the future, it is more expensive.

00:00:29.471 --> 00:00:32.330
It is more expensive.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.303
Let's say that that commodity is gold

00:00:34.303 --> 00:00:36.938
and I'll just make up gold prices
for the sake of simplicity.

00:00:36.938 --> 00:00:38.967
This isn't the current gold prices.

00:00:38.967 --> 00:00:42.802
Let's say that today, you
can go on the Spot Market

00:00:42.802 --> 00:00:50.690
and buy gold at $1,500 per ounce

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.553
but if you wanted to buy gold,

00:00:52.553 --> 00:00:53.889
if you don't want the gold today

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:55.403
and you wanna enter a Futures Contract

00:00:55.403 --> 00:00:57.068
to buy the gold, one year from now.

00:00:57.068 --> 00:01:03.347
Let's say the future is now one
year later, one year from now.

00:01:03.347 --> 00:01:05.715
Instead of buying, let me write this down.

00:01:05.715 --> 00:01:06.806
This is the Spot Market.

00:01:06.806 --> 00:01:09.433
Instead of buying in the Spot
Market for $1,500 an ounce,

00:01:09.433 --> 00:01:12.506
you could agree to buy it one year later,

00:01:12.522 --> 00:01:17.744
one year from now for $1,600 an ounce

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:22.292
and so to a trader, this
would be a market in Contango.

00:01:22.292 --> 00:01:24.349
What I wanna point out is that this isn't

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:26.407
that strange of a thing

00:01:26.407 --> 00:01:27.555
because if you think about it,

00:01:27.555 --> 00:01:28.668
you have two options.

00:01:28.668 --> 00:01:31.334
If you wanna invest in
gold and gold is something

00:01:31.334 --> 00:01:33.006
that you wanna invest for the long term.

00:01:33.006 --> 00:01:33.920
You're not gonna eat the gold.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.113
You're not going to use it to fuel
your cars or anything like that.

00:01:37.113 --> 00:01:40.809
In the situation with gold,
let's say you wanna keep gold

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:43.554
for definitely a year but
maybe many, many, many years.

00:01:43.554 --> 00:01:45.966
You have two ways of
making that investment.

00:01:45.966 --> 00:01:49.406
You could take your $1,500
and buy the gold today

00:01:49.406 --> 00:01:52.328
but if you take your $1,500
and buy the gold today,

00:01:52.328 --> 00:01:56.557
you would lose the returns
on that $1,500 on that cash

00:01:56.557 --> 00:01:58.591
that you could invest other places.

00:01:58.591 --> 00:02:03.284
You have the opportunity cost of the cash.

00:02:03.284 --> 00:02:05.639
So had you invested that
cash some place else?

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:08.046
And you also have to store that gold.

00:02:08.046 --> 00:02:09.738
In the case of gold storage,

00:02:09.738 --> 00:02:11.604
you have to find some place really secure

00:02:11.604 --> 00:02:13.007
and maybe you need to insure the gold.

00:02:13.007 --> 00:02:15.870
You need it so that people
can't steal it and all the rest.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.470
You also have the storage cost.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.415
In general, you could
save both of these costs,

00:02:23.415 --> 00:02:26.527
if you enter into the Futures Contract.

00:02:26.527 --> 00:02:29.566
Instead of just buying $1,500
of the Spot Market today,

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:31.935
you could enter into this contract

00:02:31.935 --> 00:02:34.931
where you can definitely
buy the gold one year later

00:02:34.931 --> 00:02:41.378
for $1,600 an ounce and then
you could take your $1,500,

00:02:41.378 --> 00:02:45.409
and get interest on it, so that will grow

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:49.003
and you'll also save
money on the storage cost.

00:02:49.003 --> 00:02:53.272
In either way, especially for
commodities like gold, precious metals,

00:02:53.272 --> 00:02:54.806
things that aren't consumable,

00:02:54.806 --> 00:02:58.361
things that people don't need
immediately for consumption,

00:02:58.361 --> 00:03:02.597
it's not unusual for a
market to be in Contango.

00:03:02.597 --> 00:03:06.155
Sometimes you might see a severe Contango

00:03:06.155 --> 00:03:08.129
maybe with something that is consumable.

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:14.069
So maybe right now, oil is
trading at $50 a barrel.

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.669
Once again, I'm just making up the numbers

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:21.079
and in the future, the
Futures price is at $150.

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.807
This is probably taking more into account

00:03:23.807 --> 00:03:27.294
than just the storage cost and
the opportunity cost of your cash

00:03:27.294 --> 00:03:31.706
and this might be
because there's a surplus

00:03:31.706 --> 00:03:33.269
for all oil consumption today.

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:34.935
There's just a big glut in the market

00:03:34.935 --> 00:03:36.334
and people are just trying to dump it

00:03:36.334 --> 00:03:40.956
or there might be some type of
perceived shortage in the future.

00:03:40.956 --> 00:03:42.444
So, you could think about it either way

00:03:42.444 --> 00:03:44.385
but this is very unusual.

00:03:44.385 --> 00:03:50.798
This type of severe Contango
is very, very unusual.

00:03:50.798 --> 00:03:54.004
You would expect to
see kind of minor ones.

00:03:54.004 --> 00:03:56.052
Things that take cost into consideration

00:03:56.052 --> 00:03:57.291
but not something like this.

00:03:57.291 --> 00:03:59.801
In something like this, you
can usually arbitrage it out

00:03:59.801 --> 00:04:01.980
and make some money
assuming you can store oil

00:04:01.980 --> 23:59:59.999
or you have oil to sell or
buy and all the rest of that.
