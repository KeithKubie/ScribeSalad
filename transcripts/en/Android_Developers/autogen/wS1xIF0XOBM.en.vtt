00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:50.610
of people that we run into at different
startup events and they go beta testing

00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:50.620
startup events and they go beta testing
 

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:53.250
startup events and they go beta testing
I never even heard of that if only I had

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:53.260
I never even heard of that if only I had
 

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:56.610
I never even heard of that if only I had
known or really I can reply to my users

00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:56.620
known or really I can reply to my users
 

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:58.890
known or really I can reply to my users
reviews if only I had known and so our

00:26:58.890 --> 00:26:58.900
reviews if only I had known and so our
 

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:00.660
reviews if only I had known and so our
goal today is to try to make sure all of

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:00.670
goal today is to try to make sure all of
 

00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:02.550
goal today is to try to make sure all of
you here are aware of the tool kit that

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:02.560
you here are aware of the tool kit that
 

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:06.930
you here are aware of the tool kit that
we offer on Google Play so Gus actually

00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:06.940
we offer on Google Play so Gus actually
 

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:08.850
we offer on Google Play so Gus actually
introduced me to the saying recently if

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:08.860
introduced me to the saying recently if
 

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:11.640
introduced me to the saying recently if
you want to go fast go alone but if you

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:11.650
you want to go fast go alone but if you
 

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:12.850
you want to go fast go alone but if you
want to go far go

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:12.860
want to go far go
 

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:15.370
want to go far go
together and what I really like about

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:15.380
together and what I really like about
 

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:18.250
together and what I really like about
this is that what we want to do is to go

00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:18.260
this is that what we want to do is to go
 

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:20.680
this is that what we want to do is to go
to go it with you and to help you go

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:20.690
to go it with you and to help you go
 

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:23.620
to go it with you and to help you go
faster and we hope that through working

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:23.630
faster and we hope that through working
 

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:25.419
faster and we hope that through working
with Google Play you'll be able to go

00:27:25.419 --> 00:27:25.429
with Google Play you'll be able to go
 

00:27:25.429 --> 00:27:29.370
with Google Play you'll be able to go
together and also go twice as fast so

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:29.380
together and also go twice as fast so
 

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:31.419
together and also go twice as fast so
we're gonna talk about four different

00:27:31.419 --> 00:27:31.429
we're gonna talk about four different
 

00:27:31.429 --> 00:27:33.610
we're gonna talk about four different
types of tools that are the most unique

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:33.620
types of tools that are the most unique
 

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:35.799
types of tools that are the most unique
things that we have to offer developers

00:27:35.799 --> 00:27:35.809
things that we have to offer developers
 

00:27:35.809 --> 00:27:38.680
things that we have to offer developers
especially startups on Google Play so

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:38.690
especially startups on Google Play so
 

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:39.549
especially startups on Google Play so
let's get started

00:27:39.549 --> 00:27:39.559
let's get started
 

00:27:39.559 --> 00:27:42.490
let's get started
so Google Play works a little bit

00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:42.500
so Google Play works a little bit
 

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:44.380
so Google Play works a little bit
differently right and I think one of the

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:44.390
differently right and I think one of the
 

00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:46.659
differently right and I think one of the
things that people need to know

00:27:46.659 --> 00:27:46.669
things that people need to know
 

00:27:46.669 --> 00:27:48.280
things that people need to know
especially if they've been on other app

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:48.290
especially if they've been on other app
 

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:50.980
especially if they've been on other app
platforms before is Google Play actually

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:50.990
platforms before is Google Play actually
 

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:52.060
platforms before is Google Play actually
has some things that are a little bit

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:52.070
has some things that are a little bit
 

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:53.590
has some things that are a little bit
different about it so the earlier in

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:53.600
different about it so the earlier in
 

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.150
different about it so the earlier in
your life you can find out about all the

00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:55.160
your life you can find out about all the
 

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:56.919
your life you can find out about all the
different features that we have that may

00:27:56.919 --> 00:27:56.929
different features that we have that may
 

00:27:56.929 --> 00:27:58.480
different features that we have that may
actually change how you want to move

00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:58.490
actually change how you want to move
 

00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:00.120
actually change how you want to move
through your product development cycle

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:00.130
through your product development cycle
 

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:02.919
through your product development cycle
so the first thing that's important to

00:28:02.919 --> 00:28:02.929
so the first thing that's important to
 

00:28:02.929 --> 00:28:05.110
so the first thing that's important to
know is that for any of you who have an

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:05.120
know is that for any of you who have an
 

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.669
know is that for any of you who have an
app on Google Play does anyone have an

00:28:06.669 --> 00:28:06.679
app on Google Play does anyone have an
 

00:28:06.679 --> 00:28:09.280
app on Google Play does anyone have an
app on Google Play today by the way ok

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:09.290
app on Google Play today by the way ok
 

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:11.230
app on Google Play today by the way ok
does anyone have an app that's still in

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:11.240
does anyone have an app that's still in
 

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:13.890
does anyone have an app that's still in
stealth mode or not on Google Play yet a

00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:13.900
stealth mode or not on Google Play yet a
 

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:16.870
stealth mode or not on Google Play yet a
couple folks so well we're hoping to

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:16.880
couple folks so well we're hoping to
 

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:19.600
couple folks so well we're hoping to
reach you a little bit earlier so the

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:19.610
reach you a little bit earlier so the
 

00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:20.950
reach you a little bit earlier so the
most important thing for you to know is

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:20.960
most important thing for you to know is
 

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:22.750
most important thing for you to know is
that you can publish your app on Play

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:22.760
that you can publish your app on Play
 

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:24.909
that you can publish your app on Play
any time you want and developers tell us

00:28:24.909 --> 00:28:24.919
any time you want and developers tell us
 

00:28:24.919 --> 00:28:26.830
any time you want and developers tell us
year after year that's one of the most

00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:26.840
year after year that's one of the most
 

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.750
year after year that's one of the most
important things to them is it all of

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:28.760
important things to them is it all of
 

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.280
important things to them is it all of
you are in control about when you can

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:30.290
you are in control about when you can
 

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:32.440
you are in control about when you can
publish your app there's no you know big

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:32.450
publish your app there's no you know big
 

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:33.520
publish your app there's no you know big
weight or anything like that

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:33.530
weight or anything like that
 

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:36.100
weight or anything like that
and the next thing that you want to

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:36.110
and the next thing that you want to
 

00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:37.900
and the next thing that you want to
think about after that is this idea of

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:37.910
think about after that is this idea of
 

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:41.080
think about after that is this idea of
beta testing and staged rollouts so you

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:41.090
beta testing and staged rollouts so you
 

00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:43.810
beta testing and staged rollouts so you
know at Google we have an app we have

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:43.820
know at Google we have an app we have
 

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:45.850
know at Google we have an app we have
lots of apps and when we release them we

00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:45.860
lots of apps and when we release them we
 

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:47.590
lots of apps and when we release them we
don't want to put them out there to all

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:47.600
don't want to put them out there to all
 

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.570
don't want to put them out there to all
the users with just the initial version

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:49.580
the users with just the initial version
 

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:51.610
the users with just the initial version
right what we want to do is to kind of

00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:51.620
right what we want to do is to kind of
 

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:53.890
right what we want to do is to kind of
roll them out more progressively and to

00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:53.900
roll them out more progressively and to
 

00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:56.590
roll them out more progressively and to
get feedback along the way so these two

00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:56.600
get feedback along the way so these two
 

00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:58.360
get feedback along the way so these two
tools beta testing and staged rollouts

00:28:58.360 --> 00:28:58.370
tools beta testing and staged rollouts
 

00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:00.039
tools beta testing and staged rollouts
are unique tools on Play that you can

00:29:00.039 --> 00:29:00.049
are unique tools on Play that you can
 

00:29:00.049 --> 00:29:01.299
are unique tools on Play that you can
use to make sure that you get a really

00:29:01.299 --> 00:29:01.309
use to make sure that you get a really
 

00:29:01.309 --> 00:29:04.030
use to make sure that you get a really
high quality result and also kind of

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:04.040
high quality result and also kind of
 

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:06.250
high quality result and also kind of
take control of your rollout and so we

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:06.260
take control of your rollout and so we
 

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:08.380
take control of your rollout and so we
want to walk you through how this is and

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:08.390
want to walk you through how this is and
 

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:09.820
want to walk you through how this is and
what we see from a lot of our most

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:09.830
what we see from a lot of our most
 

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:11.890
what we see from a lot of our most
successful developers is they actually

00:29:11.890 --> 00:29:11.900
successful developers is they actually
 

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:14.260
successful developers is they actually
use these products every day the beta

00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:14.270
use these products every day the beta
 

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:16.030
use these products every day the beta
testing and the staged rollouts so for

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:16.040
testing and the staged rollouts so for
 

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:18.220
testing and the staged rollouts so for
example at Google but basically every

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:18.230
example at Google but basically every
 

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:20.080
example at Google but basically every
app update we roll out we use staged

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:20.090
app update we roll out we use staged
 

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:21.790
app update we roll out we use staged
rollouts and we think that even startups

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:21.800
rollouts and we think that even startups
 

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:23.140
rollouts and we think that even startups
can benefit from these sorts of things

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:23.150
can benefit from these sorts of things
 

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:25.360
can benefit from these sorts of things
as well we see when you use these

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:25.370
as well we see when you use these
 

00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:26.380
as well we see when you use these
practices you can

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:26.390
practices you can
 

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:28.150
practices you can
with a much higher quality result higher

00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:28.160
with a much higher quality result higher
 

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:30.280
with a much higher quality result higher
quality app and a much better business

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:30.290
quality app and a much better business
 

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:32.920
quality app and a much better business
return as well so let's start by talking

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:32.930
return as well so let's start by talking
 

00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:35.230
return as well so let's start by talking
about beta testing is anyone here

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:35.240
about beta testing is anyone here
 

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.940
about beta testing is anyone here
running a beta test or everyone run one

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:36.950
running a beta test or everyone run one
 

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:39.460
running a beta test or everyone run one
in the past that's awesome so we

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:39.470
in the past that's awesome so we
 

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:41.080
in the past that's awesome so we
actually see with some of our most

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:41.090
actually see with some of our most
 

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:43.060
actually see with some of our most
popular apps the top thousand apps on

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:43.070
popular apps the top thousand apps on
 

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:45.370
popular apps the top thousand apps on
Google Play 60% of them are running a

00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:45.380
Google Play 60% of them are running a
 

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:47.440
Google Play 60% of them are running a
beta test right now and so if you

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:47.450
beta test right now and so if you
 

00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:49.600
beta test right now and so if you
haven't tried a beta test before here's

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:49.610
haven't tried a beta test before here's
 

00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:52.000
haven't tried a beta test before here's
basically the idea you can distribute

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:52.010
basically the idea you can distribute
 

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:54.010
basically the idea you can distribute
your app to a subset of users and then

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:54.020
your app to a subset of users and then
 

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:55.930
your app to a subset of users and then
you can get feedback earlier rather than

00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:55.940
you can get feedback earlier rather than
 

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:58.330
you can get feedback earlier rather than
just launching it to everyone with beta

00:29:58.330 --> 00:29:58.340
just launching it to everyone with beta
 

00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:00.760
just launching it to everyone with beta
testing what's important here is users

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:00.770
testing what's important here is users
 

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:02.650
