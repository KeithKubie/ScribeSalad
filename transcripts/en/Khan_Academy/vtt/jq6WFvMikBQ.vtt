00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.560
 

00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.670
Define a dilation that
maps line a onto line b

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.180
by choosing a center
and a scale factor.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.260
So let me get my scratch out to
think about this a little bit.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.650
So let's, just for
fun, let's imagine

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.410
that we pick a point
that sits on line a

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:19.515
as our center of dilation.

00:00:19.515 --> 00:00:21.830
And for simplicity,
let's pick the origin.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.224
So let's imagine that our
center of dilation is at 0, 0.

00:00:26.224 --> 00:00:28.140
And let's just pick an
arbitrary scale factor.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.070
Let's say our scale factor is 2.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.830
And let's think
about what happens.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.680
This means that each of
the points on point a

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.070
are going to get twice as far
from our center of dilation

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.900
after the dilation than they
were before the dilation.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.060
Twice as far.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.440
So for example, this
point right over here,

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.560
it's 3 away in the x
direction before dilation.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.750
So it's going to be 6 away in
the x direction after dilation.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.996
Likewise, it's 3 away in the
y direction before dilation.

00:00:55.996 --> 00:00:58.120
So it's going to be twice
as far in the y direction

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.540
after dilation.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.440
So it's going to go from the point (3,3) to the point (6,6).

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.465
Notice, it got twice as far away
from the center of dilation.

00:01:08.465 --> 00:01:10.990
 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.110
It essentially got pushed
out along the line.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.570
Same thing for this point.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.800
This point is 3 less in the
x direction than our center,

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.240
and 3 less in the y
direction than our center.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.330
So after a scaling,
after dilation

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.630
centered at the origin,
with a scale factor of 2,

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.190
it's going to be
twice as far away.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.550
So it's going to be 6
less in the x direction,

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.050
and 6 less in the y direction.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.800
Once again, just pushed out.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.460
So notice when we picked
a center of dilation

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.270
that sits on the line,
it really doesn't matter

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.380
what scale factor we pick,
we'll just essentially

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.650
be stretching and shrinking
the points along the same line.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.650
And since this line just keeps
going on and on and on forever

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.370
in both directions, it's really
just going to map onto itself.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.530
If this was a line segment,
we would be mapping it

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.320
to a different line segment
that would have the same slope,

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.810
but its length would change.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.060
But a line has an
infinite length.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.440
So as you stretch
and squeeze it,

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.356
it still has an infinite
length, and it's just

00:02:09.356 --> 00:02:11.180
mapping it onto itself.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.705
So this dilation
right over here,

00:02:13.705 --> 00:02:16.250
a, is going to map onto itself.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.040
It's just going to map onto a.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.350
So that's not going
to suit our purposes.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.550
But what can suit our purpose is
if we pick another point that's

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.710
not on a, and not on b.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.810
So let's say we pick this
point right over here.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.410
And I like this point, and so
let me pick that as my center.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.392
I'll tell you why I
like it in a second.

00:02:38.392 --> 00:02:39.350
That is the point 3, 2.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.460
 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.690
The reason why I
like that, is we

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.230
can see that this point on
point a right now is 1 away,

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.320
and if I want to map it to the
corresponding point on point b,

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.550
well that's going to be 3 away
from our center of dilation.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.190
So I could have a
scale factor of 3.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.590
If I have a scale factor of
3, it's going to go 3 times

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:04.440
as far away.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.150
 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.900
And that'll work for
other points as well.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.870
For example, this
point right over here.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.170
It's 1 to the left of
our center of dilation.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.900
If we have a scale factor of 3,
it's going to be 3 to the left.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.080
So it's going to map.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.200
If we think of it that
way, you could think of it

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.760
as going right over there.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.894
So I'm going to go with center
at 3, 2, scale factor of 3.

00:03:29.894 --> 00:03:32.060
And you could have picked
many, many other-- in fact

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.445
an infinite number
of other centers,

00:03:33.445 --> 00:03:35.580
and then you would have had to
calculate the appropriate scale

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.621
factor for each of those.

00:03:36.621 --> 00:03:39.460
But I like this one because
it fit nicely on the grid,

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.160
and I was able to figure
out how much to scale it.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.160
So I picked my center,
so I want to dilate,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.195
I want to pick my
center at 3, 2.

00:03:49.195 --> 00:03:51.860
 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.030
And I want to scale it by 3.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.040
So let's check our answer.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.940
We got it right.
