00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:03.670
â™ª I'll treat you right.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.339
(Upbeat music)

00:00:10.577 --> 00:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
- Well, season two of PubLIZity
is, like, a very exciting

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.383
thing because, like, a
number of things happen.

00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:17.751
- Correct and, like,
the things about me

00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:19.152
are, like, probably
the most amazing.

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:22.155
And you can expect that
I will be expecting.

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:26.493 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Yeah, Liz, as unavailable
as she is to say, is pregnant.

00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:27.761
Wait, you're---

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:28.928
- I'm pregnant.

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:31.264
(apprehensive music)

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:32.565
- What?

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:34.067
- Liz, I've told
you, like, a lot.

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:36.669 align:start size:94% position:6%
- No, I'm thrilled for
you, like, that's amazing.

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:37.637 align:start size:81% position:19%
- No, like, you're
my best friend.

00:00:37.637 --> 00:00:39.139
- You're, like, my best friend.

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:41.408
Like, I'm obviously, like,
super-thrilled for you, but--

00:00:41.408 --> 00:00:42.375
- Thank you, I'll
leave it at that.

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:44.811
I'm keeping it this time.

00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:45.645
- Amazing.

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:49.315
(upbeat music)

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:53.420
- She's, like, amazing.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.189 align:start size:84% position:16%
She's, like, my
best friend in ever.

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:58.792
I wouldn't want to spend,
like, my professional,

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:00.894
or personal, or television life.

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:03.096
Which is all the same
thing at this point,

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:04.064
with anybody else.

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:04.931
She's so amazing.

00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:05.765
Uhummmazing....

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:08.668
(squeaking noises)

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:13.973
like, anyway,

00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:15.408
but it's like she can be

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:16.609
really difficult, too.

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:18.044
- That's not true.

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:19.412 align:start size:94% position:6%
- I think I could probably
do a much better job

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:20.814
of taking care of
your an-ne-ce-tees,

00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:22.515
or your own baby, or
this business than

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:23.750
you ever could.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.051 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Like I'm going to
take my own advice and

00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:26.553
I'm going to, like, go to bed.

00:01:26.553 --> 00:01:30.457
And that's what you're left
with, so I'm storming out.

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:34.594
(melodramatic music)

00:01:37.063 --> 00:01:39.632
(upbeat music)

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:43.336
- She's, like, an
amazing person--

00:01:43.336 --> 00:01:46.106 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Liz, you have to
incorporate your question

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:48.341
in your sentence.

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:49.576
- For who?

00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:50.877
- For everyone in the audience.

00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:52.579
- Oh, all right,
I'm sorry, wait...

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.147
Can you repeat the question?

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:56.015 align:start size:97% position:3%
- What is your favorite
thing about working with me?

00:01:56.015 --> 00:01:57.784
- Oh my God, she's
an amazing person.

00:01:57.784 --> 00:02:00.286 align:start size:88% position:13%
And, like, a role model,
like, for other women

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:03.189 align:start size:97% position:3%
and, like, honestly at
this point, like, for women

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.258
like, she's a front-runner.

00:02:05.258 --> 00:02:07.093
Like, she's gonna get
the job done in like--

00:02:07.093 --> 00:02:08.862
- Seriously, stop it.

00:02:08.862 --> 00:02:10.363
- I can't stop, Liz,

00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:11.965
cause you make me go, go, go.

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:13.733
Like, you inspire me.

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:16.136 align:start size:81% position:19%
- You're not going
to make me cry

00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:19.572
in front of this whole
electronic press kit?

00:02:21.908 --> 00:02:23.510
- You're my best friend.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.879 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Like, Liz, you're
my best friend.

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.014
- I just, like,
love you so much.

00:02:28.014 --> 00:02:30.183
- I love you too, Liz.

00:02:30.183 --> 00:02:32.819
- But anyways, for me it's
like she loves to have fun.

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.122 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I do and, like, honestly,
I throw up in a bucket,

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:38.391
like, in our office, constantly.

00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:41.728
And, like, Liz is,
like, brave about it.

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:44.597
I just keep throwing up.

00:02:44.597 --> 00:02:47.367 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Are you sure that's
not some guy's--

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:48.201
- What?

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:50.937 align:start size:84% position:16%
