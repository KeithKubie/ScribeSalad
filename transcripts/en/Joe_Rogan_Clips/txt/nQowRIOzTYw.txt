Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience about here's an interesting cat man. Yes, yes. A bunch of things rolled up into one because he's a, he's a legitimate Catholic, like he was really Catholic. Yeah. Despite all the scandals and kid fucking and all the craziness. And then on top of that he's this character, but now he's not the character anymore. No. Now he's like a guy who's not totally playing the character, but the character comes in and out like little shadows. Yes, it does. It's like what are you, what's your real thoughts on things? Cause I know you as Cole Bear. Yeah. Know you from the Colbert report, this hilarious fake Republican guy and now I'm seeing you. I'm, I'm not, I'm not sure what's going on here, man. Yeah. I mean he's, well, and when you're, when you're in late night, you know, I play a character on my show too.

Speaker 1:          00:50          That's like a heightened version of myself that's developed as like a very extra nerdy, it's almost like me as peewee Herman, a little bit like it's, it's uh, towards me as my younger self. It's like very socially awkward. I'm a love, oh, sorry. Like, it's a lot of up there, you know, and it's different than what I do on stage. Uh, and uh, you know, I can only imagine, even though he is still, he's like, his big thing for late night was like, I'm going to be myself. I'm not the character anymore. You still build a little bit of a character for yourself, you know? Yeah. Well also with him it's like that's what brought him to the dance. Yeah. The reason why you, there is like what kind of meetings that they have with him. Like what are we going to do here? We can tie this trait.

Speaker 1:          01:27          Pico bear, I heard him say once, he only said this in one interview, but he was like, we're basically creating a new character for late night. And so he had the same writers from, from the cold bear rapport. And so, uh, he was like, we're sort of like creating a new character. How does this character work? But I got to say the old show, I mean he's, he's great. The old show was probably the best performance ever made by a single late night comic because the way that he, when I watch it now, if I go back and watch clips, I'm like the way he would do like three or four fast little turns, you know, you know, single line where it would like mean one thing but there'd be some sub tax than he would flip around and he would do it like it was like watching, um, like a, a figure skater do triple axles, you know, like watching him do that.

Speaker 1:          02:06          It was, it was really impressive. I liked the guy, don't get me wrong, but I, I like him more on the Colbert report and I'm like him as a late night talk show host. But I do have to agree. I think that's also my prejudice against that format. I'm like, you guys just saw what Jack Parr did and kept going. Totally. It's the same goddamn thing. But I understand why he couldn't do the cold, but he did that show for like 10 years, you know, like you can't, you can't do, that was a limited thing for him. You know, like he had that character and so he could only do what was in the box, that character. And so he's looking to do more and, and I get it. I also feel like man, that Colbert report is more interesting than the late night show to me is that comic and as a comedy writing fan for sure, because the late night shows her just promotion shows, that's all they are.

Speaker 1:          02:46          All they are is, Hey Adam, I hear you. Have a book out. Hey Mike, tell us about your new show. Here's our 10 minutes of comedy before that. And then we do that. Yeah. It's, it's basically like a version of a commercial and the, and the nightly thing is a prison, you know, because you can only talk about what happened that day. So the smartest thing that you know, John Oliver, right? He was up for the daily show. He wanted to do the daily show. He was John Stewart's pick for the daily show. They said this in the, in the oral history book of the daily show. Um, and then comedy central didn't close the deal with Oliver and HBO came and said, you want to do a show instead? You know, and John Stewart was like, all right, go with God. That's what John Oliver did instead. So we're living in that alternate reality from John Oliver Hosting the daily show.

Speaker 1:          03:25          Right. And so the smartest thing I ever did was do weekly, not daily because it lets him go wider. Right? If he was doing daily, he would have to just talk about what happened that day. You don't have that much. You don't guess what, you can't have as much of a complete thought in 24 hours or in realistically the six hours you have between when you show up. But when you take the show, right, you can't say as much you it's, it's harder. And so being on that, you know, weekly schedule and he's only doing 30 something shows a year, right. Cause they have hiatuses that's what allows them to have those big long complete thoughts that everyone likes so much. You know, these ramps and intelligent takes on news issues and pointing out hypocrisy. That's great. Our show, it takes us, we, it takes us like three or four months to write an episode.

Speaker 1:          04:08          Like we're writing 16 at once, but like, you know, that's how long we have to think about it. And so we're able to take twists and turns, you know, we go into it thinking this is going to be our angle and then we're, we're diving into the research. We have a wonderful research staff and they say, actually this is the more interesting part of the story and then we are, have the time to go chase it that way instead. Right. Whereas if we were on a daily schedule, oh shit. Well we don't have time to pivot because we got a show to make. Right. Do you ever feel time constraints? Like in terms of like the subject matter, the subject matters, like very, very involved? Yeah, I mean we try to do the most difficult topics. We can't, you know, we don't hold back from anything. Um, but the only constraint that we have is that the show, we've got 21 minutes and then in, but we've got commercials. So we only talk about some for six minutes before we have to move on. Right. And so that's the, that's the only limitation that we have.
