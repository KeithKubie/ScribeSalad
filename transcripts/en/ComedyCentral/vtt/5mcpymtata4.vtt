- Where you from?
- I'm from Birmingham.

00:00:02.068 --> 00:00:03.536 line:0%
I'm from Birmingham, Alabama.

00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:05.038 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
Yo, let me tell ya how polite
they are in Philadelphia.

00:00:05.038 --> 00:00:07.941 align:start size:97% position:3%
I saw a dude getting beat down
in the bus station bathroom

00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:11.044
and the guy that was beating
him up stopped beating him

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:12.779
to let me use the bathroom.

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:14.014
- No, yeah, that's--

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:15.281 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Which I thought
was cordial as hell.

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:17.050
He's stomping a hole
into a human being.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.318
(laughing)

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:19.919
And said, my bad,
dude, come on in.

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:21.121
Do what you do.

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:23.757
Waited patiently for
me to finish urinating.

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:25.692
And then continued to
stomp a mudhole in him.

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:28.128
- Philly culture, we're the
most polite impolite city

00:00:28.128 --> 00:00:28.995
you're gonna ever go to.

00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:31.331
(laughing)
