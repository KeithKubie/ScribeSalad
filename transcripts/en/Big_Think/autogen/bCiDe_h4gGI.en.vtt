how do you even get your foot in the
 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.810
how do you even get your foot in the
door but if you've done enough things in

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820
door but if you've done enough things in
 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.880

your life that you're competent enough
 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.740
your life that you're competent enough
that maybe a little look at you and then

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750
that maybe a little look at you and then
 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.569
that maybe a little look at you and then
they phone you and say we'd like you to

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579
they phone you and say we'd like you to
 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:32.679
they phone you and say we'd like you to
be an astronaut now suddenly you're

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689
be an astronaut now suddenly you're
 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:34.630
be an astronaut now suddenly you're
starting a whole new phase of life you

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640
starting a whole new phase of life you
 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.190
starting a whole new phase of life you
come over this watershed and now there's

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200
come over this watershed and now there's
 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.560
come over this watershed and now there's
probably 10 or 15 years of work ahead of

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570
probably 10 or 15 years of work ahead of
 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.419
probably 10 or 15 years of work ahead of
you to get ready and be competent enough

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:40.429
you to get ready and be competent enough
 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:42.279
you to get ready and be competent enough
to be trusted to fly a spaceship and

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289
to be trusted to fly a spaceship and
 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:44.440
to be trusted to fly a spaceship and
then someday you get into a rocket and

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450
then someday you get into a rocket and
 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.819
then someday you get into a rocket and
it takes you above the atmosphere and

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829
it takes you above the atmosphere and
 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.190
it takes you above the atmosphere and
the engine shut off and you're there and

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200
the engine shut off and you're there and
 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.989
the engine shut off and you're there and
you're doing all your work and flying

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:49.999
you're doing all your work and flying
 

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:51.399
you're doing all your work and flying
the rocket and docking with a space

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409
the rocket and docking with a space
 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.419

station but at the end of it
 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:57.700
station but at the end of it
what do you do with that experience now

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710
what do you do with that experience now
 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.980
what do you do with that experience now
you've you've done all of these

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990
you've you've done all of these
 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.779
you've you've done all of these
incredibly complex and extremely

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789
incredibly complex and extremely
 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.539
incredibly complex and extremely
dangerous things in order to push back

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549
dangerous things in order to push back
 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.410
dangerous things in order to push back
the edge of human capability and of our

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420
the edge of human capability and of our
 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.749
the edge of human capability and of our
understanding of the world itself but

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759
understanding of the world itself but
 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.140
understanding of the world itself but
now what do you do with the the sequence

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150
now what do you do with the the sequence
 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.670
now what do you do with the the sequence
of things that have turned you into who

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680
of things that have turned you into who
 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.680
of things that have turned you into who
you are and the things that have come in

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380
through your eyeball
 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.860
through your eyeball
you've tried to understand and I think

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870
you've tried to understand and I think
 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.440
you've tried to understand and I think
part of the continuing responsibility of

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450
part of the continuing responsibility of
 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.000
part of the continuing responsibility of
being one of the world's astronauts is

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010
being one of the world's astronauts is
 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.090
being one of the world's astronauts is
not to keep it to yourself but to try

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100
not to keep it to yourself but to try
 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.540
not to keep it to yourself but to try

is new astronaut didn't exist when I was

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030
is new astronaut didn't exist when I was
 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.600
is new astronaut didn't exist when I was
born I wasn't a word and yet we've had

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610
born I wasn't a word and yet we've had
 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.100

station for the last 17 or 18 years so

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870
station for the last 17 or 18 years so
 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.400
station for the last 17 or 18 years so
it's it's moving along pretty quickly

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410
it's it's moving along pretty quickly
 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.890
it's it's moving along pretty quickly
but I want as many people to to

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900
but I want as many people to to
 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.720
but I want as many people to to
understand it and start thinking about

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730
understand it and start thinking about
 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.780
understand it and start thinking about
it in their own lives and so you have to

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790
it in their own lives and so you have to
 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:26.500
it in their own lives and so you have to
do the job right

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510
do the job right
 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.780
do the job right
you have to put in those 25 years of

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790
you have to put in those 25 years of
 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.200
you have to put in those 25 years of
work to be competent enough to go be one

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210
work to be competent enough to go be one
 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:33.550
work to be competent enough to go be one
of the folks that's exploring the

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560
of the folks that's exploring the
 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.310
of the folks that's exploring the
universe but I think it's also important

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320
universe but I think it's also important
