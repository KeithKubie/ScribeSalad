00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.635
OK there you have it.

00:00:01.635 --> 00:00:04.271
Libtards, Cucksand Snowflake's
are the three words

00:00:04.271 --> 00:00:07.307
that we want you to stop
calling us in the comments.

00:00:07.307 --> 00:00:09.843
Let us know which word you want
people to stop calling you.

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:13.413
See you next time on every damn
day. Ryan that last take was.

00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:17.184
A take. Reminder the nurse
will be by this afternoon

00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:21.555
to give everyone flu shots.
Great  I don't have health
insurance. Do flu shots cover rabies?

00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:24.024
 This dog licked me you can't
get rabies from a  dog licking
you

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:26.393
I didn't tell you where he
licked me. Did he lick you on
the voodoo doll you

00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:27.594
Keep on a chain around your neck

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:29.263
Cuz that can  give you rabies

00:00:29.263 --> 00:00:31.365
It happened to my uncle
he lives with the wolves now.

00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:33.534
OK guys let's just
please act normal today.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.013
Hi
So you're like a doctor right.

00:00:46.013 --> 00:00:47.414
No.

00:00:47.414 --> 00:00:50.284
No. I'm a nurse just here
to give a flu shot.

00:00:50.284 --> 00:00:51.585
Don't sell yourself short.

00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:54.888
Listen getting this flu shot
makes me so nervous.

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:58.926
I feel like that maybe qualifies
me for some medical weed.

00:00:58.926 --> 00:01:00.160
Wink wink.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.963
I need five flu shots
a shit load of Z packs

00:01:02.963 --> 00:01:04.164
and whatever medical exams

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:06.233
I need
between the ages of 18 and 30.

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:10.003
Or you can have one flu shot
or no flu shots.

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:15.542
What about three flu shots
and I slip you a 20.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.246
Okay. This is sterile.
So where to draw the line.

00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:24.151
I don't trust this so-called.
Flu shot. I'm sorry what.

00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:27.020
Oh this is how they killed off
the X-men

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.355
and get them all
with the legacy virus

00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:29.589
What are you saying

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:31.892
Oh what I'm saying is this
better not put me in the sunken
place

00:01:31.892 --> 00:01:36.396
Oh god so much anxiety
really could use some medical
MDMA

00:01:36.396 --> 00:01:37.597
or medical whippets

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:40.901
is no such thing as medical
wippets whatever the medical
term is.

00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:43.704
I just need to get
as medicated as possible.

00:01:43.704 --> 00:01:45.439
Wink wink.

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.107
You know you're not
even winking when you do that.

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:49.543
Thank you so much for coming in.
Yeah it's really great because

00:01:49.543 --> 00:01:51.912
when you work full time you know
it's hard to find the time.

00:01:51.912 --> 00:01:55.115
Of course. Oh actually.
Can we do my voodoo doll first.

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:57.985
So he doesn't get jealous.
What is wrong with you people.

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:00.487
We make comedy content
for the Internet.

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:02.656
So each of our brains
is broken in different ways.

00:02:02.656 --> 00:02:04.958
Okay great. Dolly wants a shot
but a down shirt

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.995
going to get right in the middle
of the neck there. Oww

00:02:07.995 --> 00:02:09.696
Yeah yeah.
Okay good.

00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:13.066
Well he is good for the flu
then okay. Great job.

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:14.868
Why do you have a special trash
can for the needles

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:17.471
Used needles
are a biohazard.

00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:20.440
I get it you're trying
to clone a black man.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.809
Kill the originals.
and control the clones.

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:25.379
Who are you talking to 
I'm talking to my people

00:02:27.781 --> 00:02:31.385
So how's your day going.
SHUT UP AND LET ME DO MY JOB
ok

00:02:38.692 --> 00:02:39.926
I.

00:02:39.926 --> 00:02:42.195
Am so so sorry.
I told them to act normal.

00:02:42.195 --> 00:02:45.465
I appreciate your apology
but please never call me again.

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:50.504
They're on to us.

00:02:50.504 --> 00:02:53.073
Chris knows abort operation
chocolate clonedrone.
