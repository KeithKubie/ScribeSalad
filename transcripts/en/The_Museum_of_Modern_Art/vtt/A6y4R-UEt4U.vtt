00:00:02.795 --> 00:00:04.463
All photographers make choices,

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.050
whether it's how you frame
something on Instagram,

00:00:07.216 --> 00:00:09.843
what kind of camera you use,
what kind of print you make,

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.678
how you share that picture.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.223
The power of photography
is way more complicated

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:15.933
than people admit to.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.728
You have to learn to understand
how images are constructed.

00:00:19.895 --> 00:00:22.273
I got into photography
because I wanted to know something

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.315
that other people didn't know.

00:00:23.483 --> 00:00:25.235
What makes a single image
important anymore?

00:00:25.401 --> 00:00:26.276
How do you make that image

00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:28.405
that people are going
to run to museums for?

00:00:28.571 --> 00:00:29.405
What is it about me?

00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:31.240
What are we bringing
to this photograph?

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.535
I think you have
to contend with a lot,

00:00:33.701 --> 00:00:35.870
and that is a very
worthwhile experience.

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:39.665
When you think of photographs
as processes, not as products,

00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:42.418
you start really understanding
what they really mean.

00:00:42.585 --> 00:00:43.920
How is the process different?

00:00:44.128 --> 00:00:46.703
I want it to be not
about grabbing the moment,

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.315
but about dancing with the moment,
collaborating with the moment.

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:50.676
Can you see what I see?

00:00:50.843 --> 00:00:52.511
No, no one else can see it.

00:00:52.928 --> 00:00:55.640
You can stop something
and look at it in a way

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.683
that you normally wouldn't see it,

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.518
and I think that's part
of the real fascination

00:00:59.685 --> 00:01:00.686
with still photography.

00:01:00.853 --> 00:01:04.190
It lets you step outside yourself
to kind of look at the world

00:01:04.356 --> 00:01:05.650
in a different way.

00:01:06.608 --> 00:01:08.068
Okay, so it's going
to be half a second.
