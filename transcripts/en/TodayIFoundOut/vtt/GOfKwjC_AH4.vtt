00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.960
The Normandy Invasions represented one of
the single largest military maneuvers in history.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.141
Beginning on June 6, 1944, D-Day (see, What
does the “D” in D-Day stand for?), the

00:00:35.141 --> 00:00:39.540
invasion was the largest amphibious assault
of all time and involved what basically amounted

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.800
to the collective might of a large percentage
of the nations in the industrialized world

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.390
working in tandem to defeat the Nazi war machine.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.620
One of the most iconic images of the invasion
was that of a French beach covered in oppressive-looking

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.960
metal crosses.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.080
As it turns out, those crosses were merely
a small part of an expansive network of sophisticated

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.260
defences the Allies managed to somehow circumvent
in mere hours.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.160
Dubbed “the Atlantic Wall” and constructed
under the direct orders of Adolf Hitler himself

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:13.491
in his Directive 40, the formidable defences
stretched and astounding 2000 miles of the

00:01:13.491 --> 00:01:14.960
European coast.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.490
Intended to ward off an Allied invasion, the
Atlantic Wall consisted of endless batteries

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:26.220
of guns, an estimated five million mines (of
both the sea and land variety) and many thousands

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.730
of soldiers who occupied heavily fortified
bunkers and fortresses along its length.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.439
The wall has been described as a “three-tier
system of fortifications” where the most

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:41.149
valuable and vulnerable locations were the
most heavily fortified while positions of

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:44.230
lesser importance became known as “resistance
points” that were more lightly defended

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.030
but would still pose an imposing obstacle
to any invasion force.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.630
In the rush to create defences, gun batteries
were haphazardly thrown together, consisting

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.680
of basically whatever the Nazis could get
their hands on.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.299
As a result, everything from heavy machine
guns to massive cannons cut from captured

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.740
French warships were utilized in the construction
of fortresses and bunkers.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.979
Though they looked threatening, this “confusing
mixture of sizes and calibres” proved to

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.650
be an issue for the Nazis when they couldn’t
scrape together the ammunition to arm them

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:15.650
all.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.420
Still, the guns, in combination with the several
other layers of defences, were believed to

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.300
make the coast of Europe “impregnable”.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.520
The largest of these guns represented the
first line of defence of the Atlantic Wall

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.030
and the Germans spent countless hours practise
shelling “designated killing zones” experts

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.370
predicted Allied ships would most likely use
to invade.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.780
After this were expansive submarine nets and
magnetic mines chained to the ocean floor

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.050
to deter submarines and ships.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.040
In shallower water, the Nazis attached mines
to sticks and buried large logs deep in the

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.709
sand pointed outwards towards the ocean- the
idea being boats would either be taken out

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.930
by the mines or have their bows broken against
the poles.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.379
After this was a defensive emplacement known
as the Belgian gate which were large heavy

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.370
fences attached to steel rollers which could
be positioned in the shallows.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.690
Following this were millions of mines lying
just beneath the sands waiting for soldiers

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.650
who managed to make it ashore.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.599
Along with all of this, there were also those
metal cross thingies- or to give them their

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.849
proper name, Czech hedgehogs.

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:20.650
As the name suggests, the Czech hedgehog was
invented in Czechoslovakia and was mostly

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.690
designed to serve as a deterrent for tanks
and other armoured vehicles, as well as in

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.049
this particular case if the tide was right,
approaching ships attempting to land on shore.

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:34.690
Originally designed to sit along the Czechoslovakia-Germany
border as part of a massive fortification

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.290
effort conducted in the 1930s, the hedgehogs
never ended up serving their original purpose

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.140
when the region was annexed by Germany in
1938.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.409
It’s reported that the Czechs originally
wanted to build a large wall between the two

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:50.280
countries, but a cheaper solution was found
in the form of these hedgehogs, which could

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.939
be mass-produced by simply bolting together
beams of steel.

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:56.010
So what purpose did they serve?

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.330
Put simply, if a tank or other such vehicle
tried to drive over one, the result was inevitably

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.020
it becoming stuck on the thing, and even in
some cases having the bottom of the tank pieced

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.020
by the hedgehog.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.560
When used on a beach like this, as previously
alluded to, they also had the potential to

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.099
pierce the hulls of ships approaching the
shores if the tide was high at the time.

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.650
On top of that, particularly the anchored
variety of hedgehogs proved difficult to move

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.090
quickly as even massive explosions didn’t
really do much of anything to them.

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.750
Speaking of anchored hedgehogs, it isn’t
strictly necessary for the hedgehogs to be

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:27.950
anchored to anything normally.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.610
It turns out that tanks trying to drive over
the unanchored ones had a good chance of getting

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.530
themselves stuck just the same.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.340
In these cases what would usually happen was
the hedgehog would roll slightly as the tank

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.339
tried to power its way over, with then the
weight of the tank often causing the steel

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:46.950
I-beams to pierce the bottom of the tank,
completely immobilizing it.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.750
In fact, in testing, unanchored hedgehogs
proved slightly more effective than their

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.830
anchored variety against heavy vehicles.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.000
However, because of the tide issue in this
case, to keep the hedgehogs in place, those

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.659
closest to the water did have thick concrete
bases anchoring them in the sand.

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:06.260
Using about a million tons of steel and about
17 million cubic meters of concrete, the broken

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.719
wall these Czech Hedghogs created was a much
more viable option than trying to create a

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:15.040
solid wall over such a span, while also not
giving the enemy forces too much cover, as

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.110
a more solid wall would have done.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.130
That said, while initially a deterrent, the
hedgehogs ended up helping the Allies after

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.020
the beaches were secured, as they proved to
be a valuable source of steel and concrete

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.830
that was repurposed for the war effort.

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.659
For example, almost immediately some of the
steel beams were welded to tanks, turning

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:33.469
them into very effective mobile battering
rams.

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:37.510
Yes you read that correctly- the Allies cut
up dedicated anti-tank fortifications and

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.260
welded them to their tanks to make them even
more badass of weapons.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.760
The Soviets also made extensive use of Czech
hedgehogs, often using the concrete to literally

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:51.080
cement them in place in cities and along bridges
to halt German armored divisions in their

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.080
tracks.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.800
As you can imagine, just one of these in a
narrow street proved to be an extremely effective

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.110
barrier that also left the enemy trying to
get rid of it open to weapon fire.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.060
While some Czech hedgehogs were constructed
to specific factory specifications, which

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:06.260
stipulated exact measurements (usually 1.4
meters in height) and materials (anything

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:11.820
sturdy enough to survive around 500 tonnes
of force), most were made of scavenged materials.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.750
In the end, the hedgehogs along with the countless
other fortifications proved to be a formidable,

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.580
but not impassable obstacle for the Allies.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.240
In fact, thanks to a massive, concerted bombardment
effort from the naval and air-based forces

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.260
of the Allies, strategic commando strikes,
and the bravery of the hundreds of thousands

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.530
of troops who physically stormed the beaches
all those years ago, all of the defences were

00:06:33.530 --> 00:07:55.179
bypassed in a matter of hours, though at the
cost of several thousand lives on D-Day alone.
