Speaker 1:          00:01          All right. I asked you to come in with definite lists of where Paul was when according to two different sources. The purpose of the lecture today is to get you to see what you may think of as a historical text as actually not a very reliable historical text. This is not to say anything about your faith, it's not to say anything about how you might use this text religiously are theologically and other words. It is not my intention to attack the reliability of the Bible for theological reading or for faith or your personal beliefs about the Bible. But what we will do is demonstrate a difference today between reading this text theologically a scripture and reading it as historical source simply as a text or a series of texts actually cause as you know by now, the New Testament is a collection of texts. If all you had were these documents about the first several decades at the beginning of Christianity, and as a matter of fact, all you have as documents for the first sec, a few decades of Christianity are the new testament texts.

Speaker 1:          01:13          There are documents not in the new testament, but they tend not to tell us anything we want to know about, for example, the very beginnings of of Christianity as a movement. So what you've gotten, the new testament comprise at least the, uh, some of the earliest material we have. If you want to know about the life of Jesus, for example, the four Canonical Gospels with perhaps the gospel of Thomas, which we'll be reading later, give you basically only the only information about Jesus of Nazareth available to historians. The same thing for Paul there our second century sources that talk about Paul or they claim to be letters by Paul, but most of us scholars don't believe they have any historical, reliable information. So what we've got about Paul is what you have in the New Testament. I'm going to try to get you to use two of those sources, Galatians and the acts of the apostles. And then we're going to talk about what can we know about Paul from these two texts. So now pick your list out that you made for acts. When is the first time we see the Apostle Paul in acts chapter, in verse. I'm a former fundamentalist, which means I want chapter and verse on everything.

Speaker 2:          02:25          Perfect

Speaker 1:          02:27          chapter and verse. When was the first time we see Paul? Yes sir. Nine one.

Speaker 2:          02:37          And where is he

Speaker 1:          02:40          on the road to Damascus? We starts off in Jerusalem.

Speaker 2:          02:47          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:49          Now is that actually the first time we see Paul in the book of Acts Perfect in seven 58 so we actually see him before then. And what's where is he there? That's right. He was witnesses. The stoning of Stephen, who by tradition is the first Christian martyr, first person to die for Christianity and acts. And he's in what city? Where's he? Come on folks quicker. Quicker. Where's the and he's in Jerusalem. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          03:29          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:30          Now let's just read that first part there. They dragged him out of the city. That is, Steven began to stone him. The witnesses laid their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul, who the writer of acts will later tell us is also named Paul. So stall is acts depixol as his Jewish name. And Paul is sort of his great Greek and Roman name. While they were stoning Stephen, he prayed and so forth. Look at eight one and Saul approved of their killing him that day as severe persecution began against the church in Jerusalem. All except the apostles were scattered throughout the countryside of Judea and Sumeria. Devout men buried Stephen and made loud limitation over him. But Saul was ravaging the church by entering house after house, dragging off both men and women. He committed them to prison. So Saul, as he's known here, is fairly active in Jerusalem as a persecutor of the followers of Jesus. He causes several. You've arrested, they know who he is, they would recognize him. He's got a reputation. So that's where the first time we see Paul is seven 58 and then we the con, the acts as we'll see, does a lot of other things. And then comes back to Paul. Now at nine one so after nine one when's the next time we see Paul? And x

Speaker 1:          04:55          goes, he's on the road to Damascus. Did y'all do this homework? Yes sir. In the back. Rolling 1225 and what? Where is that? Okay. Barnabas and Paul go back to Jerusalem.

Speaker 1:          05:23          Let's back up a bit. So I think we're missing some stuff. I want every detail of time, every detail of place. Look at nine 26 when he had come to Jerusalem, he attempted to join the disciples. They were all afraid of him for they did not believe he was a disciple, but Barnabas took him, brought him to the disciples, the apostles, and describe for them how on the road he had seen the Lord who had spoken to him, how in Damascus he had spoken Bogan name of Jesus. So he went in and out among in Jerusalem speaking boldly in the name of the Lord. He spoken, argued with the Hellenistic, that is Greek speaking Jews, but they were attempting to kill him. When the believers learned of it, they brought him down to Cesarea and sent him off to tarsus. So notice in chapter nine you've got several chronological and spatial details about Paul.

Speaker 1:          06:15          That's what I wanted you to notice. Not just read it quickly. Don't read this stuff like college students read it as really critical readers, not just to get the reading done, but notice the details. Now I'm, I'm that stressing this now because over and over again in this semester, we'll, we'll try to push you to read it much more carefully noticing details. That's the only way to practice close reading. Okay, so we've got him in Jerusalem, we had a Damascus, but before 1225 we have lots of other material with him being in Jerusalem and introduced to the church there. And when is this chronologically? You don't have to know the year, but how much time are we talking about between this Damascus period and this time? Barnabas introduces them to the rest of the church and gets them accepted by the church. Yes. Just as in after some time had passed, there's one place where it says he's three days in Damascus after he sees Jesus before he's baptize. So we have three days, then he's bad ties. And then he disputes with other people in Damascus. But basically just after some time. So it can't it, we're probably not talking several years here. Right. You get the impression when you're reading this that you know, it may be months, it may be weeks.

Speaker 1:          07:41          Okay, so then, so this is time in Jerusalem. Um, what happens after Barnabas introduced them Jerusalem. Look at nine 30 when the believers learned a bit, they brought him down to Cesarea and sent him off to tarsus. So again, before we get him in Jerusalem here he's in Cesarea, which is a city on the coastline of Palestine and he's in Tarsus. Why does he go to Tarsus? Do you think that's his home? Exactly. According to acts, Paul is from tarsus. Now when we get further, I'll point out when we know, when we have information about Paul that we get from his letters and when we have information about part of the, we only get from acts and with the question I'll ask you is, are they both reliable? Are they both equally reliable? If you have one piece of information from Paul's letters and a different kind of a piece of information from ax is one of them more likely to be historical.

Speaker 1:          08:37          Those are the kinds of questions we'll ask. Yes sir. Tarsus is, um, in the very eastern part of what is now Turkey. Okay. So it's, it's not far from the border of eastern Turkey and western Syria. It's in modern Turkey at the time. At that time it was in the area called Cilicia. And that'll be important because when we get to Galatians, Paul talks about going to solicit at one point and I'm going to say, why did he go to solicit and where is that? And some smart person's gonna say, well, isn't Parsis the main capital city of Cilicia and Iranian part? And I'll say, that's brilliant. You made a very important connection there. Okay, so he goes to tarsus. Now you don't hear him much about, uh, Paul because then you have other kinds of stuff. And then

Speaker 1:          09:35          look at 11, 19. Now those were scattered because of the persecution that took place over Stephen. Notice how it will get this and then we'd get to the acts of the apostles or the electric on that. There's a been a jump here in the period of time. The stoning of Stephen was way back there at the end of Chapter Seven, the beginning chapter eight. Then you had a lot of other material now that the authors kind of taking you back to that stoning of Stephen episode. So this is like one of those things that you know, it's a cutaway. It's a, it's a time lapse sort of uh, in, in the, the filming here, they traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus and Antioch and they spoke the word to no one except Jews, but among them were some men from Cypress and Cyrene who aren't coming to Antioch.

Speaker 1:          10:14          Spoke to the Helen is also proclaiming the Lord Jesus and the hand of the Lord was with them in a great number of became believers and turned to the Lord. News of this came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem. They sent Barnabas to Antioch. When he came and saw the grace of God, he rejoiced. He had exhorted them all to remain faithful to the law with step, have devotion. Free was a good man, full of the host, bit of faith and a great many people were brought to the Lord. Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul. So again, before we get this, we have Saul going to Antioch again, Barnabas being the important figure who does that. Uh, when he came, he saw the grades, we've got blah, blah, blah. Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul and uh, when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. So it was that for an entire year. They met with the church and taught a great many people and it was an Antioch that the disciples were first called Christians. Um, at that time profits came down from Jerusalem. So we have one year here

Speaker 1:          11:22          in Antioch. Before the next incident happens, one of them named Agablith stood up and predicted by the spirit that there would be a severe famine over our little world. This took place during the reign of Claudius. The disciples determined that according to their ability, each would send relief to the brothers living in Judea. This they did sending it to the elders by Barnabas. And Saul. So in 1130 we have Paul going from Antioch, with Barnabas to Jerusalem,

Speaker 2:          11:54          taking with them funds to alleviate famine for famine relief in Judea from the disciples in Antioch. Okay. When's the now after that, do we have another time we see Paul,

Speaker 1:          12:12          that's when you get the 1225 Barnabas, after completing the mission, Barnabas and Saul returned to Jerusalem and brought with them John, whose other name was mark. Actually, I think that may need to be returned from Jerusalem. There's a, there's a um, manuscript debate over whether they returned to Jerusalem or from Jerusalem, but in any case there in Jerusalem and then 13 one that we find them back in Barnabas, Barnabas, and Saul there. So chapter 13 has Barnabas and Saul and Antioch. Again,

Speaker 1:          13:02          while they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, set apart from me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I've called them. Then after fasting and praying, they laid their hands on them and sent them off. They went by the Holy Spirit. They went to Solutia. Okay. Then we have what's called the first missionary journey. All right, so this is the first week you're near Barnabas and Paul. They travel through that part of central and southern Turkey that we call Asia minor if for the ancient world called Turkey. Now, so what happens next after 13 one where does Paul go?

Speaker 2:          13:37          Yes sir.

Speaker 1:          13:40          Okay, so they, they have a confrontation with the magician called bar Jesus. Where else? Yes. Cyprus. Yep. So Cypress Psalmist, they're traveling around. Where else? Where do they end up? Sorry, I conium it's another place they go to next. Lystra Darby. Next Durga. Pega. Next video video. Where do they end up after that first journey? At the end of the journey. Back in Antioch.

Speaker 2:          14:24          Okay,

Speaker 1:          14:29          so we're going to include all those places you just said in the first missionary journey and then they end up and Antioch. Where's the next place they go? Jerusalem. What do they do this time in Jerusalem?

Speaker 2:          14:51          Sorry.

Speaker 1:          14:52          They have a debate. The whole, the leaders of the church get together. They debate. What's the topic of the debate whether gentiles have to be circumcised to be members of the community and who makes the decision? Pardon? Who makes the decision? Somebody, right? Somebody say it out loud a lot. Enough, sorry James. They all make the decision together. In fact, they say it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us that's an interesting way of putting it because in the book of acts, the Holy Spirit is actually the main actor of the whole book. The Holy Spirit does all this kind of stuff in the book of acts and so that's why the acts of the apostles is almost a MS title. It judged to be called the acts of the Holy Spirit a much more accurately for the narrative, but the holy spirit and with all the beliefs and James who's considered the leader of the church in Jerusalem actually announces that decision, but it's a is this isn't.

Speaker 1:          15:46          They all came to by consensus. Everybody agrees that no gentiles don't have to be circumcised and they make some rules. They say that they shouldn't eat meat sacrificed to idols. They cert shouldn't eat blood. They shouldn't commit fornication or sexual immorality. So they make some rules that they expect gentile followers to follow. They get those rules from the Jewish tradition that these were the rules that were given to Noah after the flood. That so therefore all people in the world, because all people of course that now exist, came from the people who lived through the flood, right? So all people in the world, we're given these rules, even gentiles. And so even pious gentiles should keep these rules, although they do not have to be circumcised. So that's the way that happens. Where, where does Paul go after that? We're going to move quickly. Now.

Speaker 1:          16:34          Part. Pardon? Antioch. Back to Antioch. And then he and Barnabas have a falling out. I had to have a disagreement. What's the disagreement between Paul and Barnabas about enacts, whether to take John Mark with them on the next journey? They go, uh, Paul wants to, it's wants to take mark. Paul doesn't, is that the way it goes? Yeah. And then they split up. It's a very amicable split and acts, right? It's a personnel decision. They don't have any debates about doctrine. They don't have any disagreements about what the Gospel means. They don't have any disagreements about, uh, eating our circumcision. Barnabas and Saul and Paul split up simply over a personnel decision about whether to take John Mark on the next missionary journey. So that's notice where we got, how often is Paul in Jerusalem before that? Before this main Jerusalem Council, how many times? One, two, three, four, five. He's in Jerusalem five times before the, the General Council that we, that we sort of ended up a little narrative there. Now look at Galatians and we don't have to go all the way through Galatians, but we're going to read the part of Galatians much more carefully and closely. It's only basically the first two chapters that we need. And again, we're going to put the details up on the board cause I want you to pay much closer attention to this then apparently some of you paid anyway,

Speaker 1:          18:23          one 11 I want you to know, brothers, his brothers and said, may say ancestors in your English translation, but it doesn't in the Greek that the gospel that was proclaimed by me is not of human origin, for I did not receive it from a human source, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ. So first Paul starts out on the letter saying, I didn't get my gospel from any human person. I got it straight from Jesus. Now remember, Paul didn't know Jesus during Jesus' own lifetime. So he's referring to a revelation experience that he had when he saw Jesus and some kind of visionary experience or another place. He says he was lifted up into the third heaven. So we'll talk at some point about what kind of experience was this that Paul had, but that's where he got his gospel. You have heard no doubt of my earlier life in Judaism. I was violently persecuting the Church of God and was trying to destroy it. I advanced in Judaism beyond many among my people are the same age for I was more zealous for the traditions of my ancestors. But when God who had set me apart before I was born, called me through his grace, was pleased to reveal something so that I might proclaim among the gentiles. I did not confer with any human being. Now, where is Paul at this point? According to his own statement.

Speaker 2:          19:35          Wow.

Speaker 1:          19:38          We don't know. Right. But we know one place he's not. And where is that? Because we've got, then he said, I did not, nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who are already apostles before me. But I went away at once into Arabia and afterwards I returned to Damascus. That's how you know where he was. I returned to Damascus. So where is the first place we see Paul chronologically. Geographically according to his letter, his Damascus.

Speaker 2:          20:15          Okay.

Speaker 1:          20:19          Okay, let's keep them. Then he says, um, I went to Arabia Arabia at this date at time refers to the part on the other side of the Jordan River from Judea. So it's what we would call modern Jordan, mainly. Maybe eastern Syria, western Jordan. But that's what it was. Arabian desert. That's, so he's talking about, he went away to that area that we would not call eastern or Jordan. I remember Damascus is one of the large cities in Syria, so that's where he goes. Um, afterwards I returned to Damascus.

Speaker 2:          21:00          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          21:01          After three years we'd get a nice little chronological note. I did go to Jerusalem to visit CFUs. Who has CFUs? Peter. Yeah, exactly. So Peter cfs is the Aramaic word for rock or stone. And Peter is the Greek word for rock or stone. So again, we have two different names. So he goes to Jerusalem to meet Peter, but he says, and I stayed with him for 15 days. So this first trip and Jerusalem takes 15 days.

Speaker 2:          21:44          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          21:45          no, just what he says then. But I did not see any other apostle except James, the Lord's brother.

Speaker 1:          22:00          Is that Jesus. His brother. Yes. Somebody said, according to Roman Catholic tradition, Jesus didn't have any brothers. Uh, but according to the New Testament, he did have brothers and maybe sister's according to some manuscripts. So James is called the brother of Jesus in the book of acts. Don't confuse this with James, son of Zebedee, who was one of the 12 apostles, has a different James. There are several James's, uh, cause it was a very common name in the ancient world. And you know, of course James is just the Anglos Ization of Jacob. So it's actually Jacob in the Greek and that's the word it is. It becomes James in English. So James, the Lord's brother in what I'm writing to you before, God, I do not lie. What, why does Paul have his panties in a wad confirming that he only was there 15 days and he only saw Peter and James. I swear it, I swear it. I swear it. Then I went into the regions of Syria and solicit.

Speaker 2:          23:08          Okay.

Speaker 1:          23:08          Why do you think he went to solicit IA? That's where tarsus is. Maybe that's a clue that he actually was from tarsus. Although Paul doesn't never tell us he's from Tarsus, so we don't know that's his hometown from him, but that's what acts says is his hometown. So what maybe he went to Tarsus, we don't know. He just says he went to seriousness. I was still unknown by site to the Churches of Judea that are in Christ. They only heard it said the one who formally was persecuting us is now proclaiming the faith and the ones tried to destroy and they glorify God. I did. I was not known by sight. They heard my reputation. They heard that I persecuted followers of Jesus, but nobody, no follower of Jesus in Judea knew what I looked like except Peter and James and he's two swears it. He's very adamant. Then after 14 years, so we have a 14 year period of time. I went up again with Barnabas taking Titus along with me. I went up in response to a revelation. Why does he say he went up in response to a revelation?

Speaker 3:          24:14          You might have an idea.

Speaker 1:          24:17          Yes. No. As we'll see throughout this letter. Paul is a month to make it very clear that he is not playing second fiddle to anybody in Jerusalem. He didn't get his gospel from those disciples. He didn't get it from Peter and James. He got it straight from Jesus. He didn't check his gospel out with them at this point. He got it from Jesus. Paul is trying to establish his independence from the church in Jerusalem and he's eventually gonna try to establish that I'm just as much an apostle as they are.

Speaker 1:          24:52          I went up the responsibility. In other words, he went up in response to a revelation that God appeared. God's told, uh, Pete Paul according him go to Jerusalem. He didn't go because the Jerusalem authorities said, we need to check you out and see if you're okay. Come to Jerusalem. They did. This was not a command performance. He's insisting that I laid before them though only in private meeting with the acknowledged leaders, the gospel that I proclaim among the gentiles in order to make sure that I was not running or had not run in vain. But even Titus who was with me was not compelled to be circumcised, though he was a Greek, but because of false believers, secretly his causes pro false brothers secretly brought in who slipped into spy out the freedom that we have in Christ Jesus so that they might enslave us. We did not submit to them even for a moment, so that the truth of the Gospel might always remain with you.

Speaker 1:          25:42          And and from those who are supposed to be acknowledged leaders what they actually were make no difference to me. God shows no partiality. Notice again, Paul is really kind of angry and anxious about not wanting to cede any authority to these Jerusalem leaders except as they are local leaders. Those leaders contributed nothing too new to me. On the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the Gospel for the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been entrusted with the Gospel for the circumcised, for he who worked through Peter, making him in a positive of the circumcised also work through me and sending me to the gentiles. And when James and CFUS and John, this is James the Lord's brother, CIF as Peter and the disciple John who acknowledged pillars, recognize the grace they've been given to me. They gave to Barnabas and me the right hand of fellowship, agreeing that we should go to the gentiles and they to the circumcised.

Speaker 1:          26:31          They ask only one thing that we remember the poor, which was actually what I was eager to do. Now, there's a big question here is what Paul is describing here. Basically this Jerusalem conference, is it his version? It's quite different. At the white Paul Paul x complexities, it's mainly him and sort of the leaders of the Jerusalem church. You'd get together. It's not. It wasn't brought about by some crisis. Paul went because God told him to do so. They could just all make sure that they have an agreement. They make an agreement. Gentiles don't have to be circumcised. Cut. Nobody pressured except these false brothers Titus to be circumcised the pillars. Peter, James and John did not insist that gentiles be circumcised. They agreed with Peter's with Paul's Gospel. The next thing that happens though. So look at what Paul says. He starts in Damascus. Here's an Arabia who's Damascus, three year period of time he's in Jerusalem, but only 15 days.

Speaker 1:          27:28          He only sees Peter and James. Then he goes back to, goes to Syria and solicit and then after 14 years later, so it's some scholars say, well is this 14 years including the three years that is as this 14 years from his revelation or we have 17 years. So when you, when you try to figure out the chronology for Paul's ministry in life, you have to make that decision. I think that what's more likely is this 14 years is sincere to be 14 years after this, three years. So you've got 17 years that would put this Jerusalem meeting in about 17 years after Paul's own conversion. If he was converted, he seems to be converted very early, are called to be an apostle very early. If Jesus died around the year 30 perhaps Paul, let's say just pay. Paula got his revelation in 34 so you'll be talking, you know, 17 years after say 34 or 35 is when you have this Jerusalem conference and then you have the the next thing. Now what happens next though? Now what that basically is saying, let's just stop here and say, okay, how do you make this fit, this, how do you make this fit? This on over here you have Paul starting off in Jerusalem and he's persecuting the disciples. How can he then say over here that they had never seen him face his face?

Speaker 2:          28:48          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          28:48          Were all of them dead by this time? He swears they didn't know his face, which seems to me to say that Paul is claiming he wasn't in Jerusalem when he was persecuting the church. He was persecuting Christians in Syria.

Speaker 1:          29:06          He was persecuting followers of Jesus in the Jewish diaspora, not in Judea at all. That's what Paul is claiming and then he goes, masses. He goes to Jerusalem for 15 days, but only sees these people and it's 17 years total is the first time he's seen publicly in Jerusalem by many different followers of Jesus that just doesn't seem to fit here. Here he starts off in Jerusalem, he's in Jerusalem again. He goes from Damascus, but it seems like it's only, you know, a matter of weeks or months perhaps. He's in his, in Antioch for a year. He goes back to Jerusalem and he's an ally for year. He goes back to Jerusalem. Uh, he's, uh, back to Jerusalem here in Beckley, Islam here. He's all, he's in and out of Judy Andrews from all the time. Which one of these is accurate or do you believe that now you can find really, really brilliant fundamentalist who believe that the Bible has to be historically and scientifically true and every one of its details. And you know what? They can kind of figure out how to harmonize all this, but it takes a lot of very brilliant work.

Speaker 1:          30:12          It's much more likely, isn't it? That one of these accounts is more accurate than the other. Which one do you believe? That's a real question. Which one do you believe somebody could make me an argument? Decide, come on, break out of that, you know, undergraduate shyness and just make an argument. Yes. You believe x, y did you believe x? Say it loud.

Speaker 2:          30:42          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          30:49          that sounds like a historical account. It doesn't. It doesn't seem like it has a big ax to grind in Galatians. Paul is obviously has an extra grind. He's, he's gone all over himself saying, I'm not lying. I'm not lying. I'm not lying. This fellow says maybe Paul's protesting too much in Galatians and acts sounds a bit more like an impartial account. The rest of you by that everybody nods their head. That sounds good to everybody. Yes sir.

Speaker 1:          31:17          Yeah. Galatians is a firsthand account. I mean, acts was written by someone we don't know even know who it, who wrote it, but it obviously wasn't written by someone who saw this stuff. He says he used other sources and so when we get to the gospel of Luke and acts, which were both written by the same person will see that this authored admits. They use other sources. So he was not an eye witness of any of this stuff. At least the stuff that he tells him about. Uh, here in this part, there's some debate about whether he maybe was an eye witness for some of the travels of Paul later and they'll and x. But at this point he doesn't even claim to have been there. So wooden is a historian. Wouldn't you take an account by an eye witness? The person who actually experienced this over an account written later. So this gentleman over here says, no, Paul's account is better historical source because he was there. Anybody else make an argument? Well, what about the idea that the writer of acts is just telling a story? Paul clearly has an an ax to grind, not to make a pun.

Speaker 2:          32:23          Yes,

Speaker 1:          32:30          that's right. So the writer of acts could be having an ax to grind, which is to make the church sound more harmonious and United and all that sort of thing. It may also be that the writer of acts wants to emphasize the center of Jerusalem and Judea and the leaders there as the central authority. For the early Christian movement and so he's, he's exaggerating Paul's presence in Jerusalem and exaggerating the role of these leaders in Jerusalem. So yeah, it's a good point. The writer of acts, we should all, we should all know that every, uh, written account of anything, no matter how historically good at is still has a point of view. Still has an agenda. Yes.

Speaker 1:          33:12          No acts was written after the life of Paul so Paul doesn't have access to the book of acts as one of his sources. Now the other question is, did the writer of acts have access to Paul's letters and we don't know. Okay. The basic time for me to wrap up here, the basic question here is whether you decide to trust more acts or Paul on this issue is a historical question. But the basic point also is to get you by very, very close reading of this text to see that it's much better historical practice as a historian to not text, not take any of these texts as simple, straightforward history. What I will argue eventually is that Paul is probably telling what is more accurately the case. Yes, he has a reason to stress it, but he says it so forceful and he writes it in a letter.

Speaker 1:          34:09          And if he had actually been in Jerusalem as much as access, couldn't the people who received his letter have checked this out? Yeah, they could. They could basically say later, no Paul, in spite of saying that you do not lie, you're a liar. We've, we know we've checked it out. So Paul's letter I would say is much more likely to ha to contain better historical evidence, but the, but we can argue about that till till the cows come home. The main point is that you still have to sift to these documents with a lot of careful sifting to get any reliable historical data out of them. For example, later when we get to Galatians some of these things, we'll talk a bit about what really happened in Antioch that caused the Split Between Barnabas and Paul in acts. It's all like, oh no, they just had a personnel decision, uh, disagreement that they parted perfectly in, in, in agreement about the Basic Gospel.

Speaker 1:          35:05          According to Galatians, no Barnabas and Paul disagreed strongly over whether Jews could continue and table fellowship with uncircumcised gentiles and Barnabas went along with Peter and some disciples from James in Jerusalem and saying, no, even Jewish followers of Jesus shouldn't share meals with uncircumcised gentiles. Paul believes that Barnabas got that wrong, so according to Paul's letters, Paul split with Barnabas on a serious disagreement over doctrine and practice in the early church and again acts kind of slides that over cause acts tries to make the church look completely harmonious. This is historical criticism. Reading these texts, just like you would read any other ancient texts with just the same amount of scrutiny and suspicion that you would any text. That's what we're going to do in this semester. It's different from reading the text of scripture. This is not to say that I believe reading the Texas scripture is bad or wrong.

Speaker 1:          36:08          I believe it's just with a different way of reading. I think you can come up with good, true Christian theological readings of the New Testament and you can come up with very decent historical readings in the New Testament. They just always won't be the same kind of reading. But what this class is going to do for the most part is talking about that historical reading. And when we get to Paul and we get to acts, we're going to pick these texts all apart. We're going to ask questions like, is any of this historical? If so, what and why? So start thinking that way and then I'll see you on Wednesday.
