00:00:01.163 --> 00:00:02.648
- [Voiceover] Lets see if we can imagine

00:00:02.648 --> 00:00:05.141
a three-dimensional shape

00:00:05.141 --> 00:00:07.889
whose base could be viewed as

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:10.688
this shaded in region between

00:00:10.688 --> 00:00:13.567
the graphs of Y is equal to F of X

00:00:13.567 --> 00:00:15.734
and Y is equal G of X.

00:00:15.734 --> 00:00:17.607
That's the base of our ...

00:00:17.607 --> 00:00:20.397
this purple, this I guess
mauve or purple color

00:00:20.397 --> 00:00:22.286
is the base of it.

00:00:22.286 --> 00:00:24.791
It's kind of popping out of our screen.

00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:26.102
What I've drawn here in blue,

00:00:26.102 --> 00:00:28.099
you could view this kind of the top ridge

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:29.944
of the figure.

00:00:29.944 --> 00:00:32.834
If you were to take cross
sections of the figure,

00:00:32.834 --> 00:00:34.659
that's what this yellow line is.

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:37.125
If you were to take cross
sections of this figure,

00:00:37.125 --> 00:00:39.853
that our vertical, I should say

00:00:39.853 --> 00:00:42.625
our perpendicular to the X axis,

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:44.899
those cross sections are going to be

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:47.518
isosceles right triangles.

00:00:47.518 --> 00:00:49.055
This cross section

00:00:49.055 --> 00:00:50.962
is going to look like this,

00:00:50.962 --> 00:00:52.980
if you were going to flatten it out.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.481
So over here it's sitting.

00:00:54.481 --> 00:00:57.623
It's popping out of your
page or out of your screen.

00:00:57.623 --> 00:01:00.719
If you were to actually flatten it out,

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.300
the cross sections would look like this.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.738
It's going to be an
isosceles right triangle

00:01:05.738 --> 00:01:09.826
with a hypotenuse of the
isosceles right triangle

00:01:09.826 --> 00:01:12.632
sits along the base.

00:01:12.632 --> 00:01:14.315
Sits along the base.

00:01:14.315 --> 00:01:16.339
So, it's isosceles. So
that's equal to that.

00:01:16.339 --> 00:01:17.878
It's a right triangle,

00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:20.073
and then this distance

00:01:20.288 --> 00:01:23.112
this distance between that point

00:01:23.112 --> 00:01:27.205
and this point is the same as the distance

00:01:27.205 --> 00:01:30.111
between F of X and G of X.

00:01:30.449 --> 00:01:35.449
F of X and G of X for this
X value right over there.

00:01:36.147 --> 00:01:40.952
Now obviously that changes
as we change our X value.

00:01:40.952 --> 00:01:42.977
To help us visualize this shape here,

00:01:42.977 --> 00:01:46.528
I've kind of drawn a picture
of our coordinate plane.

00:01:46.528 --> 00:01:48.691
If we've viewed as an angle,

00:01:48.691 --> 00:01:49.937
if we're kind of above it,

00:01:49.937 --> 00:01:50.960
you can kind of start to see

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.198
how this figure would look.

00:01:52.198 --> 00:01:53.960
Once again, I've drawn the base.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.911
I've drawn the base of it.

00:01:57.264 --> 00:02:00.323
I've drawn the base of
it right over there.

00:02:00.323 --> 00:02:02.274
Maybe I should to make it clear.

00:02:03.304 --> 00:02:04.467
Let me get like this.

00:02:04.467 --> 00:02:06.823
Shade it in kind of parallel

00:02:06.823 --> 00:02:08.398
to these cross sections.

00:02:08.398 --> 00:02:10.550
So, I've drawn the base right over there.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.990
There's two other sides.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.616
There the side that's on
... I've drawn it here.

00:02:15.616 --> 00:02:17.846
I guess you could view it on its top side

00:02:17.846 --> 00:02:21.076
or the left side right over there.

00:02:21.076 --> 00:02:23.194
Over on this picture that would be this.

00:02:23.194 --> 00:02:25.260
When we're looking at it from above.

00:02:25.767 --> 00:02:28.468
Then you have this other side.

00:02:28.468 --> 00:02:29.765
I guess on this view

00:02:29.765 --> 00:02:32.997
this one you could call
kind of the right side.

00:02:32.997 --> 00:02:35.028
Over here this is kind of the ...

00:02:35.028 --> 00:02:37.819
when you viewed over here
this is the bottom side.

00:02:38.803 --> 00:02:41.025
The whole reason why I set this up,

00:02:41.025 --> 00:02:43.550
and we tempting to visualize this figure.

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:47.683
I want to see if you can
come up with a definite

00:02:47.683 --> 00:02:51.415
integral that describes
the volume of this figure.

00:02:51.415 --> 00:02:53.592
That kind of almost looks like a football

00:02:53.592 --> 00:02:55.357
if you cut it in half or a rugby ball.

00:02:55.357 --> 00:02:57.329
It's skewed a little bit as well.

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.982
What's an expression a
definite integral that

00:02:59.982 --> 00:03:01.890
expresses the volume of this.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.615
I encourage you to use the fact

00:03:04.615 --> 00:03:06.063
that it intersects at the points.

00:03:06.063 --> 00:03:08.418
These functions intersect
at the point zero zero

00:03:08.418 --> 00:03:09.753
and (c,d).

00:03:09.753 --> 00:03:11.372
Can you come up with some expression

00:03:11.372 --> 00:03:13.485
a definite in row of terms of zeros,

00:03:13.485 --> 00:03:16.483
and Cs, and Ds, and Fs, and Gs

00:03:16.483 --> 00:03:18.867
that describe the volume of this figure?

00:03:20.267 --> 00:03:21.690
Assuming you've paused the video,

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.113
and have had a go at it,
let's think about it.

00:03:25.036 --> 00:03:26.990
If we want to find the volume,

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:28.426
one way to think about it is

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.794
we could take the volume of,

00:03:31.794 --> 00:03:33.859
we could approximate the volume

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.606
as the volume of these
individual triangles.

00:03:37.606 --> 00:03:40.729
That would be the area of
each of these triangles

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:43.520
times some very small depth.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.525
Some very small depth.

00:03:46.586 --> 00:03:48.155
I'll just shade it in to show the depth.

00:03:48.155 --> 00:03:52.964
Some very small depth
which we could call DX.

00:03:52.964 --> 00:03:55.769
Once again we could find
the volume of each of these

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.301
by finding the area,

00:03:57.301 --> 00:03:58.748
the cross sectional area there,

00:03:58.748 --> 00:04:00.412
and then multiplying that times

00:04:00.412 --> 00:04:02.590
a little DX.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.218
A little DX which would give us three,

00:04:05.218 --> 00:04:07.548
so this is a little DX,

00:04:07.548 --> 00:04:09.843
which would give us three-dimensional.

00:04:09.843 --> 00:04:13.028
That's our DX. I could write
that a little bit neater.

00:04:14.135 --> 00:04:16.499
DX to give us a little bit
of three-dimensional depth.

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:18.292
How could we ... what is the volume of

00:04:18.292 --> 00:04:19.917
one of these figures going to look like?

00:04:20.686 --> 00:04:25.037
Well, if we say, let me
just call this height H.

00:04:25.037 --> 00:04:29.832
We know that H is going
to be F of X minus G of X.

00:04:29.832 --> 00:04:31.739
That's this distance right over here.

00:04:31.739 --> 00:04:33.252
Let's call that H.

00:04:33.252 --> 00:04:35.392
We know that H is going to be,

00:04:35.392 --> 00:04:37.579
maybe I should say H of X.

00:04:38.825 --> 00:04:40.780
It is going to be a function of X.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.485
H of X is going to be F of X.

00:04:43.485 --> 00:04:48.485
F of X minus G of X. Minus G of X.

00:04:49.028 --> 00:04:54.028
Given a H, what is going to
be the area of this triangle?

00:04:54.955 --> 00:04:57.970
This is a 45, 45, 90 triangle.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.590
This is 90, then this is going
to have to be 45 degrees.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.309
That's going to have to be 45 degrees.

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:06.139
We know that the sides
of a 45, 45, 90 triangle

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.392
or squared of two times the hypotenuse.

00:05:08.392 --> 00:05:11.666
This is going to be
squared of two over two

00:05:11.666 --> 00:05:13.267
times the hypotenuse.

00:05:13.267 --> 00:05:15.977
Squared two over two time the hypotenuse.

00:05:15.977 --> 00:05:18.659
You could get that straight
from the pythagorean theorem.

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:21.390
If the side, let's say it's length A,

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.463
then this side has length A.

00:05:23.463 --> 00:05:26.573
You're going to have A
squared plus A squared

00:05:26.573 --> 00:05:28.735
is equal to the hypotenuse squared,

00:05:28.735 --> 00:05:32.246
or two A squared is equal
to the hypotenuse squared.

00:05:33.384 --> 00:05:36.773
A squared is equal to the
hypotenuse squared over two,

00:05:36.773 --> 00:05:40.975
or that A is equal to H
over the squared of two,

00:05:40.975 --> 00:05:44.321
which is the same thing as
a squared of two H over two.

00:05:44.321 --> 00:05:46.046
I just rationalized the denominator,

00:05:46.046 --> 00:05:47.191
multiplied by open numerator,

00:05:47.191 --> 00:05:48.695
and then denominator by squared of two.

00:05:48.695 --> 00:05:50.288
That's where I got this from.

00:05:50.672 --> 00:05:52.259
What is the area going to be?

00:05:52.612 --> 00:05:55.125
The area is just going
to be your base times

00:05:55.125 --> 00:05:57.015
your height times one-half.

00:05:57.015 --> 00:05:58.797
Let me write that down.

00:05:59.442 --> 00:06:00.497
The area

00:06:01.282 --> 00:06:02.831
the area there

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:05.347
the area is just going to be the base,

00:06:05.347 --> 00:06:09.849
which is squared of two over
two times our hypotenuse,

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:12.438
times the height which is
squared of two over two

00:06:12.438 --> 00:06:15.453
time our hypotenuse, times one-half.

00:06:16.037 --> 00:06:17.557
Times one-half.

00:06:17.557 --> 00:06:18.693
If we didn't do that one-half,

00:06:18.693 --> 00:06:22.227
we'd be figuring out the
area of this entire square.

00:06:22.227 --> 00:06:24.162
This is obviously where
were concerned with

00:06:25.392 --> 00:06:26.595
the triangle.

00:06:26.634 --> 00:06:27.895
What's this going to be?

00:06:27.895 --> 00:06:29.708
This is going to be
squared of two over two

00:06:29.708 --> 00:06:31.984
times squared of two
over two is going to be

00:06:31.984 --> 00:06:33.925
one-half and then you're going to have

00:06:33.925 --> 00:06:35.107
another one-half.

00:06:35.107 --> 00:06:40.107
So, it's one-fourth, one-fourth H square.

00:06:40.324 --> 00:06:41.559
Did I do that right?

00:06:41.559 --> 00:06:44.141
This is ... yes it's
going to be two over four,

00:06:44.141 --> 00:06:46.435
which is one-half, and then
times another one-half.

00:06:46.435 --> 00:06:49.655
This one-fourth H squared is the area.

00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:51.619
Now, what's going to be the volume

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:53.708
of each of these triangles?

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.575
Well the volume of each of
these triangles right over here,

00:06:58.128 --> 00:07:02.408
the volume is just going
to be our area times DX.

00:07:02.408 --> 00:07:07.176
It's just going to be one-fourth H squared

00:07:07.176 --> 00:07:12.176
times our depth. Times our depth DX.

00:07:12.285 --> 00:07:15.219
If we just integrated a bunch of these,

00:07:15.219 --> 00:07:19.124
from our X equals zero
all the way to X equals C,

00:07:19.124 --> 00:07:22.452
we essentially have our
volume of the entire figure.

00:07:22.452 --> 00:07:24.038
So how could we write that?

00:07:24.514 --> 00:07:25.615
We want to write.

00:07:25.615 --> 00:07:28.875
We want to essentially to
find the volume of the figure.

00:07:28.875 --> 00:07:31.705
We're kind of in the home stretch here.

00:07:31.705 --> 00:07:33.114
Actually let me write volume.

00:07:33.114 --> 00:07:34.526
This is volume of a section.

00:07:34.526 --> 00:07:36.613
Volume of a cross section.

00:07:38.227 --> 00:07:40.683
So, what's the volume of the
entire thing going to be?

00:07:40.975 --> 00:07:42.091
The volume

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:46.405
volume of the figure

00:07:46.405 --> 00:07:48.041
of the figure

00:07:49.164 --> 00:07:51.799
is going to be the definite integral,

00:07:52.752 --> 00:07:55.093
the definite integral from X equals zero

00:07:55.093 --> 00:08:00.093
to X equals C. X equals zero
to C of one-fourth H squared.

00:08:03.659 --> 00:08:05.356
One-fourth.

00:08:05.356 --> 00:08:08.916
We know that H is equal
to F of X minus G of X.

00:08:08.916 --> 00:08:10.313
Instead of H, I'm going to write

00:08:10.313 --> 00:08:15.313
F of X minus G of X squared

00:08:15.668 --> 00:08:18.157
squared DX.

00:08:18.963 --> 00:08:21.875
DX and we're done.

00:08:21.875 --> 00:08:24.686
We just found an expression for,

00:08:24.686 --> 00:08:26.568
a definite integral expression

00:08:26.568 --> 00:08:27.942
I guess you could say,

00:08:27.942 --> 00:08:31.119
for the volume of this strange figure

00:08:31.119 --> 00:08:32.487
that we have defined.
