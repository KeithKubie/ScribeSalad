in conjunction with some of
the sheet music on there.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.900

A couple of other exciting
events coming up,

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.060
And then Ambrose Akinmusire who

to tell the story of
Harry T. Burleigh.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.140
Distinguished baritone, art
song composer, music editor

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.160
and pioneer arranger of spirituals.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.080 position:56%
I'm especially grateful to have
been invited to speak at the Library

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.050 position:56%
of congress where I spent many hours

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.040
on numerous occasions
exploring the treasury

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.230
of the music divisions resources
of sheet music, music journals,

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.130
recordings, collections of
personal papers, of composers.

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.270
And being guided by the wisdom
of librarians like the legendary

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.090
but now retired, Wayne Shirley.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:07.260 position:56%
Libraries are my favorite places
and this library is the best of all.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.620
Now before I go further I need

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.520
to introduce a couple
of very special guests.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.510
Burleigh's great grandson, Harry
T. Burleigh, III is with us.

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:23.050
[ Applause ]

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.040
and let me also introduce
Dewan Reese who is the Music

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.020
and Performing Arts curator
at the new Smithsonian Museum

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.510
of African-American
history and culture.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.280
[ Applause ]

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.650
And Harry's sister Marie is on
her way but stuck in traffic

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.410
so when she comes I'll be
sure to acknowledge her too.

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.020
Exactly 100 years ago

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:50.390
in the 1916-1917 concert season
Harry T. Burleigh's art song

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.100
arrangements of spirituals
literally hit the charts.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.320 position:56%
Critics in New York and Boston
reported that Burleigh's arrangement

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.420
of Deep River was the
song most often performed

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.470
in recitals that season.

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.270
In addition, to advertisements by
his publisher in a musical America

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.710
that listed singers
who were performing it.

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:15.400
The cover of one 1917 edition
of Deep River featured the names

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.030
of 21 famous singers
who were singing it.

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.030
President Woodrow Wilson's
daughter Margaret sang it,

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.670
composer Dudley Buck's
voice student sang it,

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:29.820
African-American tenors Roland
Hayes and Sidney Woodward sang it.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.720
Deep River was one of 14 Burleigh
spiritual arrangements published

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.240
that season bringing the
powerful songs created

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.240 position:56%
by African-Americans during the dark
days of slavery to the concert stage

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.540
and to choir lofts
around the country

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.900
and far beyond our American shores.

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:53.090
Today 100 years later we are still
singing Harry T. Burleigh's solo

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.330
and choral arrangements
of spirituals.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.380
You can check them on YouTube

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.990
and you can also check his
ever expanding discography,

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:08.420
you'll find one on my
website, harrytburleigh.com.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:12.730
Who was Harry T. Burleigh and
why are the spirituals important.

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:14.590
First of all as I'm sure you know,

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:18.470
Harry T. Burleigh was born
150 years ago in Erie,

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:22.380
Pennsylvania on December 2, 1866.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.820
We've just been celebrating
his sesquicentennial.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.660
He was a third generation free man
whose grandfather had been a slave

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.930
in Summerset County, Maryland.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:35.970
And with his grandfather, Hamilton
Waters, begins what we know

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:37.480
of the story of Harry T. Burleigh.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:42.370
It is a quintessential American
story one that can tell us

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:47.290
and our children more about
who we are and who we can be.

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:50.700
What was it that prepared
Harry T. Burleigh to move

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:54.040
with such distinction,
first as a baritone soloist

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.670
in his home town much in demand.

00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:00.430
Then at age 25 to study at the
National Conservatory of Music

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:05.140
in New York City and as a singer
throughout the eastern seaboard

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:08.550
and as far west as Minneapolis.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:13.850
Then nationally and internationally
as a composer of art songs.

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:17.620
Songs written for a trained
singer, secular songs,

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.820
usually accompanied by piano.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:25.390
As a highly respected music
editor at the New York office

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:30.060
of the Recording Music Company and
finally as a pioneering arranger

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:34.260
and singer of and esteemed
lecturer on the spirituals.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.430
A vast repertoire of music
that has generated many

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:41.510
of Americas most vibrant
music traditions.

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:43.690
What was it that equipped Burleigh

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:48.540
to move far beyond his
African-American community in Erie.

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:51.730
First of all there was no
question that it was his family

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:56.230 position:56%
who had nurtured him, who supported
him in moving toward the fulfillment

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:58.640
of his impossible dreams.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:02.210
Who demonstrated a
determined love for education

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:06.710
and a staunch moral integrity
as well as a love for music.

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:11.010
They endowed him by inheritance
with rare musical gifts,

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:13.790
more specifically his
grandfather Hamilton Waters

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:16.240
who purchased his freedom for $50

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:20.540
and his mother's freedom
for $5 in 1832.

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:25.830
His mother, Elizabeth Waters
Burleigh Elmendorf who graduated

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:29.940
from Avery college in
Pittsburgh in 1855.

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:35.240
Burleigh credited her with keeping
him focused on his highest goals.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:39.000
His Aunt Louisa Waters who paid
for his first piano lessons

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.180
and in whom he confided when as
a teenager his suffered taunts

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.880
and bullying from his classmates.

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:50.700
His father, Henry Thacker
Burleigh, a union Navy veteran

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:54.770
who in 1871 was the first
African-American to serve

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:58.150
on a jury in Erie County.

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:03.780 position:56%
His step-father John Edgar Elmendorf
also a veteran of the Union Navy

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:07.650
who modeled for him and active
involvement in public life.

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:11.600
Including directly challenging
the republican establishment

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.880
that betrayed it's
promises to the man

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:19.350
who had delivered Erie's black
vote in the election of 1888.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:22.450
Burleigh's grandfather,
Hamilton Waters was said

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:25.760
to have an exceptionally melodious
voice and here you see him

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.270
with two year old Harry
and 4 year old Reginald.

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:31.370
This is about 1869.

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:36.760 position:56%
He shared with Harry and his brother
Reginald the precious heritage

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:40.550
of the songs and storied
created by the slaves.

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:43.770
In later years Burleigh often
referred to his grandfather

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:47.700
and as his father died when he
was only 6 years old it is likely

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.000
that his grandfather

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.570
and his step-father
influenced him more profoundly.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:56.580
Much more could be said about
Burleigh's family but let's move

00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:01.240
to the musical soundscape that
shaped Burleigh's early life.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:06.090 position:56%
He commented that the first music he
ever heard was the rumble of trains

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:08.660
and the songs of stevedores.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:12.950
It was a short walk from his
home on 3rd street to the docks

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:15.480
at the north end of state
street and the train tracks

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:19.020
that ran along the bay front.

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:23.080
Long before Burleigh worked as a
pantry man on the lake steamers,

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.600
he heard the singing of
dock workers and stevedores,

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.300
many of whom were from the south.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:35.360
Did he hear jubilees or spirituals
on the docks as well as well

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.730
as from his grandfather
and his mother?

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:42.070
Perhaps this is where he first
heard the roust about sound, Oh,

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:47.570
Rock Me Julie, which he
arranged for publication in 1914.

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:50.480
Burleigh said I don't recall
when I first started singing,

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.830
it seems I've been
doing so since infancy.

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:55.680
The whole family was very musical

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:59.080
and they often had family
concerts in their home.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:02.080
The first newspaper accounts
of Burleigh singing were

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.650
as part of a family quartet.

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:08.600
He described his mother as a
natural singer and credited her

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.040
as his first music teacher.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:15.410
He learned spirituals from her
as well as from his grandfather.

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:19.620
In his mother Burleigh saw a
love for art music combined

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:23.980
with an appreciation of
black music at a time

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.430
when many educated
African-Americans wanted

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:30.490
to forget those reminders
of slavery.

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:34.330
Burleigh's life-long commitment to
church music and to an episcopal

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:39.160
of mode of worship was nurtured at
the episcopal cathedral of St. Paul

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.710
where he and his family were taken

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:44.750
in as members just a few
years after the Civil War.

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:48.600
Burleigh attended St. Paul's on
Sunday mornings with his mother.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.530
The congregation was
known for its fine singing

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:55.390
and he was a charter member of
the St. Paul men and boys' choir,

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:57.860
you see him in the
third row at the right

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:02.240
and you'll also see two young
soprano's African-Americans,

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:06.470 position:56%
Charles Fisher and Charles Franklin.

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:15.020
The congregation was known for
its fine singing, I said that.

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:18.640
A survey of the hymns, anthems
and liturgical responses chosen

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:22.670
by the organist and choir director
with whom Burleigh sang shows

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:25.970
that his years at St. Paul's
introduced him to composers

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:31.120 position:56%
of church music such as
Palestrina, Tallis, Hydn, Beethoven,

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.550
Voreth, Stainer and many others.

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:37.140
Given the importance of
Burleigh's role in preserving

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:40.680
and promoting the spirituals,
it is important to know when

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:44.510
and where he heard
and sang them in Erie.

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:49.040
Erie's newspapers seldom recorded
performances of spirituals

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.890
by black citizens,
though this main mean

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:53.700
that they rarely sang
them publicly rather

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.660
than they didn't sing them at all.

00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:00.940
The St. James A.M.E. church
was established in 1874

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:03.930
and though Burleigh and his mother
attended St. Paul's the families

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:07.180
social life centered at St. James.

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:10.030
The early leaders of the
African, Methodist, Episcopal

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:14.350 position:56%
or A.M.E. church wanted their
members to demonstrate their ability

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:17.930
to move into more enlightened
American culture.

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:21.700 position:56%
And they did not encourage the use
of the songs, the cornfield ditties,

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:23.310
as Bishop Payne called them.

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:26.500
Created by their unschooled
ancestors.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.890
However the folks of St. James
did sing spirituals occasionally

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:32.670
at fund raising events.

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:35.590
Burleigh's grandfather
was a lifelong member

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:39.880
of the Himrod Mission which offered
instruction in reading, writing

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:43.710
and arithmetic as well
as Bible instruction.

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:47.120
One place we know Burleigh sang
spirituals was in the choir

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:50.360
at the Himrod Mission where
he led his blind grandfather

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:53.570
on Sunday afternoons.

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:56.270
Burleigh would have heard several
of the groups of Jubilee singers

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:59.920
that proliferated from
the 1870's on.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:03.870
The success in the early 1870's
of the Fisk jubilee singers

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:08.610 position:56%
in raising money for their Nashville
School inspired many imitators

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:12.200
who raised money for their
black schools in the south.

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.490
Jubilee performances were announced
in the Erie newspapers along

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:18.010
with vaudeville, minstrel,
popular theater

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:21.060
and opera troops coming to town.

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:24.470
Black performers were not
allowed to stay in local hotels

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:27.520
so black families provided
hospitality.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:31.350
And it was common for travelling
musicians to perform at a reception

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:34.380
or gathering after the concert.

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:37.550
Burleigh would have heard
and no doubt met some

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:38.850
of the finest black singers

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:43.130
of his time before he
left for New York City.

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:46.710
When the New Orleans University
jubilee singers came to Erie

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:50.380
in May 1888 Burleigh
joined the troop.

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:54.650
Travelling with them until they
returned to Erie in December.

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:59.110
So Burleigh was familiar with
the diverse repertoire presented

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:00.930
by the touring jubilee singers.

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:05.030
Jubilee songs, sacred songs,
secular plantation songs,

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:09.090
alongside ballads and power songs.

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:13.850
Burleigh's fine voice was
discovered in elementary school

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:17.610
and in his late teens while
he was attending high school.

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:23.610 position:56%
While he was also taking business
courses at Clark's Business College,

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:27.110
he was increasingly in demand
for solos and ensembles

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:29.810
at church and community events.

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:34.720
We know Burleigh as a singer but he
gained proficiency on the guitar,

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:39.610
the violin, the bass violin
and the timpani as well.

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:42.050
A survey of the Erie
Morning Dispatch

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:46.650
and the Cleveland Gazette a
black newspaper founded in 1883,

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:51.700 position:56%
shows that by the time Burleigh left
Erie in 1892 he was considered one

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:55.060
of the finest classical
singers in the city.

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:57.520
In addition to singing in
the men and boys' choir

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:02.340 position:56%
at St. Paul's he was a paid
soloist at Park Presbyterian church,

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:06.120
First Presbyterian church
and the Hebrew Synagogue.

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:10.810 position:56%
By 1890 his solo repertoire had
become quite sophisticated including

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:14.920
opera arias in addition to German
leader and ballads and art songs

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:18.480
by European and American composers.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:24.530
In September 1891 Burleigh again
left Erie to join a jubilee troop.

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:28.480
Frederick Louden from
Ravenna, Ohio was now manager

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.990
of the Fisk Jubilee singers.

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:34.470
Who had just returned from
a six year tour abroad.

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:36.550
Louden recruited Burleigh
who stopped

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:38.250
in Cleveland to visit friends.

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:42.180
But Burleigh's Erie fans
didn't want to let him go.

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:44.030
The Pastor and congregation

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:47.700
at the first Presbyterian Church
sent a telegram urging him

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:51.630
to decline the flattering
offer to join the Fisk tour.

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:56.620
They made their plea
irresistible by raising his salary.

00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:00.530
Burleigh aborted his trip to
Ravenna and returned to Erie

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:04.300
but only a few months later
the opportunity to audition

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.110
at the National Conservatory
of Music

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:09.700
in New York City proved even
more compelling and now offer

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:13.250
from Erie Presbyterian's
could hold him back.

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:16.170
The National Conservatory
of Music was founded

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:20.650
by the indomitable Jeanette Therber
and she needs her own biography.

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:22.420
Trained at the Paris Conservatory

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:26.740
where talented French musicians
received the best music education

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:29.860
regardless of their ability to pay.

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:32.480
Therber believed young
American musicians deserved the

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.580
same opportunity.

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:37.560
American singers and composers
should not have to travel

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.920
to Europe to learn their craft.

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:43.760
They should receive the best
possible music education here

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:48.870
where they could find their own
distinctively American voices.

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:52.920
Burleigh was one of 200 applicants
for four tuition scholarships

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:55.970
for the artists course
at the conservatory.

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:59.410
Which would prepare them for
professional performing careers

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:03.350
and he was awarded one
of the four scholarships.

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:05.150
Burleigh quickly took
his place as one

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:07.710
of the best students
at the conservatory.

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:11.330
His music history teacher,
Henry Theophilus Finck,

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:13.780
music editor of the
New York Evening Post,

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:16.400
reported that Burleigh
was the best student

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.800
in music history he ever had.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:22.770
He had trained as a stenographer
at the Clark Business College

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:28.370
and he copied his lectures
down verbatim in shorthand.

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:30.770
Therber had gathered
a stellar faculty

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:33.810
and Burleigh's accomplishments
as a student paved the way

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:36.400
for many opportunities
throughout his career.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:38.390
For example his counter
point teacher,

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:41.530
Max Spicher [phonetic] was
instrumental in his being hired

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:48.580
in 1900 at the wealthy Temple
Emanuel where he sang for 25 years.

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:51.300
Even faculty members who
didn't actually teach Burleigh,

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:56.460 position:56%
such as organ teacher Horatio Parker
remined his friends and supporters.

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:58.950
Burleigh didn't study
cello with Victor Herbert

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:03.600
but in 1914 Herbert invited him
to be one of the founding members

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:06.080
of ASCAP, the American Society of
Composers, Authors and Publishers.

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:11.840 position:56%
But of course the most consequential
connection Burleigh made

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:16.620
at the conservatory was with
Czech composer Antonin Dvorak.

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:19.300
Who arrived in late
September to be the director

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:24.210 position:56%
as Burleigh was beginning his
second semester at the conservatory.

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:27.180
Two faculty members
published the erroneous report

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:30.480
that Burleigh studied
composition with Dvorak.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:34.870
As Burleigh later explained he
was not advanced enough to be

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:37.460
in Dvorak's composition class.

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:41.690
But when Dvorak heard him sing
he invited Burleigh to come

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:44.200
to the apartment where
he and his family lived

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.760
to sing the plantation songs

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:49.420
and spirituals he'd learned
from his grandfather.

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:52.070
Burleigh would sit down
at the Steinway piano,

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:55.320
loaned by William Steinway
whose store was nearby.

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:59.370
And accompanying himself would
sing the songs of the slaves.

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:03.590
The music in which the
composer was keenly interested.

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:06.300
Dvorak listened intently
and when struck

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:10.380
by a distinctive note he would jump
up and stop Burleigh to demand is

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:13.620
that really the way
the slaves sang it?

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:17.440
But Dvorak was interested not only
in the distinctive characteristics

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:21.820
of the music, Burleigh said
he asked hundreds of questions

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:25.600
about the lives of the
slaves that created it.

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:30.160
He urged Burleigh to give
those melodies to the world

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:34.020
and this mandate would
eventually become a primary mission

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:36.410
for Burleigh.

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:37.960
Burleigh was a music librarian

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.470
of the conservatory
orchestra, directed by Dvorak.

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:44.400
And he often accompanied
the composer on his jaunts

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:48.130
through the city and to the
shipyards and the railway yards

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:51.610
which Dvorak loved to visit.

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:55.150
Beautiful penmanship was
stressed in his business training

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:58.010
and Burleigh's superb
manuscript writing made him an

00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:00.290
invaluable assistant.

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:03.220
He helped to copy the
orchestral parts for the premier

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:05.210
of the New World Symphony performed

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:08.670
in manuscript before
it was published.

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:12.800
And this is an example of his
manuscript writing, this is a song

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:18.240
that was dedicated to
Sophie Braslau, here she is.

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:23.060
I found that at the
Boston Public Library.

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:27.500
Dvorak believed in the
intrinsic value of the music

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:29.830
of ordinary Czech people.

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:32.000
He had used traditional
Bohemian songs

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.490
and dances in his compositions.

00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:37.920
Now Dvorak was to fulfill
Jeanette Therber's intention

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:41.860
that the conservatory would help
American musicians find their

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.860
American voice.

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:49.580
As John c. Tibbets observed in his
1998 essay the missing title page,

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:54.350
Dvorak and the American National
Song and this is a long quote.

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:57.190
Quote, Dvorak's American
adventure was fraught

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:00.000
with significant and controversy.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.740
The most modest of mean
he was himself a preacher

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:04.580
of contradictions.

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:07.560
Born a Czech villager,
a minority figure

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.870
in a German dominated
musical establishment.

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:15.710 position:56%
Dvorak became a cosmopolitan artist
fettered in all the musical capitals

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:18.720
of Europe, Russia and America.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.950
Many of his countrymen accused him

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:23.660
of turning his back
on his own roots.

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:27.760
And conversely the German musical
establishment criticized him

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:32.610
for his inordinate employment
of folk idioms in his music.

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:37.380
The truth is he lived in both
worlds exploiting the idioms

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:42.650
of his own culture in a
vocabulary befitting the academic

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:44.670
or classical style.

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:48.760
He was precisely the right
person to assume the leadership

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:52.010
of the national conservatory,
end of quote.

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:57.320
And we might add the precisely the
right mentor for Harry T. Burleigh.

00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:01.440
Dvorak modeled a way
to live in two worlds.

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.230
How to succeed in the world

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:07.540
of western European influenced art
music while introducing his own

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:11.450
African derived music
heritage into that world.

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:14.400 position:56%
In W.E.B. Du Boas' memorable phrase,

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:18.150
Burleigh would ever feel
his tunis [phonetic].

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:20.500
Even though in much of
his career he worked

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:23.340
within the white music
establishment,

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:28.890
Burleigh's goal was always to be a
worthy representative of his race.

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:32.980
Dvorak made music history
in May 1893 just

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:35.940
after he had finished composing
this New World Symphony.

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:38.760
By telling an interviewer
that he found in the music

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:42.340
of African-Americans
quote, all that is needed

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:45.910
for an American school
of music, end quote.

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:48.850
As you can imagine Burleigh's
comments were extremely

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:52.290
controversial, but for Burleigh

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:55.810 position:56%
and other African-American musicians
his words were electrifying.

00:24:55.810 --> 00:25:01.190
In August 1894 several months
after he had been hired

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:04.430
as baritone soloist at St.
George's Episcopal church

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:08.810
on Stuveysant Square where he
sang from more than 50 years.

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:12.020
Burleigh and Paul Bolin another
African-American student were

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:15.830
appointed to teach a new
cohort of black students

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:17.640
who were admitted to
the conservatory.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.810
Burleigh taught voice and
soul-phage [phonetic].

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:26.020 position:56%
By this time as the Chicago Observer
reported Burleigh was well-known

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:30.500
in the best sets read, elite
black communities of New York city

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:33.520
and Brooklyn as well as
Philadelphia, Washington

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:36.170
and other eastern cities.

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:39.350
He was becoming known
not only for his singing

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:42.340
but also for his compositions.

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:45.240
Burleigh's first published
composition was a simple Christmas

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:50.880
song for junior choir published
in 1896 by St. George's.

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:54.720
In 1898 his first set
of three art songs

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:58.780
and so began Burleigh's
little known,

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:03.070
but significant contribution
to American music.

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:06.000
His first art songs we're
published by G. Shirmer

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:12.460
but in 1902 William Maxwell became
Burleigh's primary publisher.

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:18.140
By 1903 when German contralto
Earnestine Schumann Heink made

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:21.320
Mammy's Lil' Baby part
of her repertoire,

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:25.580
more singers were singing and
recording Burleigh's songs.

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:29.920
And I wanted you to see this cover
because Louise Alston Burleigh

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.850
who wrote the lyrics
was Burleigh's wife.

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:39.300
I'd like you to hear Tenor Richard
Crooks sing Burleigh's 1904 setting

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:42.510 position:56%
of the wedding song, O Perfect Love.

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:48.510
[ Background noise ]

00:26:48.510 --> 00:27:57.040
[ Music ]

00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:02.920
From 1912 when William Maxwell's
brother George became the New York

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:06.370
representative of G. Ricordi
and Company based Milan,

00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:10.420
Italy Recording became
Burleigh's publisher.

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:14.520
George Maxwell also hired
Burleigh as a music editor,

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:19.400
this securing him extraordinary
access to publication of his music.

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:23.250
For years Burleigh's songs
made up a significant section

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:26.800
of the Ricordi vocal catalogue.

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:31.250
He also facilitated publication
of music by other black composers.

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:33.550
Jester Harrison told me that he

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:37.230
and other younger composers
would bring their music

00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:41.010
to the Ricordi office for
Burleigh's suggestions.

00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:45.150
Harrison said he always
had time for us.

00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:46.610
One of the strongest supporters

00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:49.840
of Burleigh's work was A. Walter
Kramer, the music reviewer

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:52.710
of the Journal Musical America.

00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:56.110 position:56%
Kramer wrote overwhelmingly
positive reviews of Burleigh's songs

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:59.990
but he proclaimed that gospel of
high culture, calling Burleigh

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:03.850
to ascend it's heights by
writing serious art songs rather

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:06.790
than waste his talent in
writing the love ballads

00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:09.800
that singers often used as encores.

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:13.630
Burleigh continued to write some
lighter ballad style songs but many

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:18.260
of his later songs reflected his
conscious movement from ballads

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:21.070
to the more serious art songs.

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:28.710
In 1914 Burleigh's first song
cycle, Saracen songs was published.

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:30.980
This was an example
of Burleigh's interest

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:32.930
in what was called orientalism.

00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:39.470
A set of 7 songs with lyrics set
in the middle eastern desert.

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:42.480
The following year Ricordi
published five songs

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:45.160
by Lawrence Hope and Passionale.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:49.400
The Lawrence Hope songs were
Burleigh's last orientalist pieces.

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:54.530
You see the requisite Lotus Blooms
and the Sari like, that's s-a-r-I,

00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:57.170
dress of the young woman.

00:29:57.170 --> 00:30:01.070
Lawrence Hope was the pin name
of Adela Florence Nicholson

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:03.660
who had grown up in India.

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:06.630
These are considered to be among
the best of Burleigh's art songs

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:10.590
and like many of his songs they
are written for lyric tenor.

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:13.620 position:56%
John McCormick performed at least 26

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:18.150
of Burleigh's art songs including
the five songs of Lawrence Hope.

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:21.830
He often premiered them and he
recorded at least four of them.

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:25.420
He also sang at least four of
the spiritual arrangements.

00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:28.080
When McCormick premiered
the Lawrence Hope songs

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:32.190
for an overflow audience that
included 600 people seated

00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:37.530
on the stage, he had to repeat
the last song, Till I Wake.

00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:42.010
One reviewer called this the
worthiest of the five songs.

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:45.510
Let's hear tenor Roderick
George sing, Till I Wake.

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:53.510
[ Background noise ]

00:30:53.510 --> 00:34:56.410
[ Music ]

00:34:56.410 --> 00:35:01.040
Burleigh's third song cycle,
Passionale featured four poems

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:04.140
by Burleigh's friend
James Weldon Johnson,

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:06.370
each of these songs
was dedicated to one

00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:10.030
of four tenors whom Burleigh knew
could sing them, John McCormick,

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:13.690
Evan Williams, Ben
Davies and George Hamlin.

00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:19.390
In June 1915 musical America band
featuring a column entitled some

00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:23.640
compositions by Americans who
are worthy of recognition.

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:26.750
The first list included
Burleigh's 19o03 song,

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:29.710
Jean and the Saracen songs.

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:35.140 position:56%
Following issues listed Ethiopia
Saluting the Colors, He Sent Me You,

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:38.340
Just You and the Glory of
the Day was in Her Face,

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:41.080
the last of the Passionale songs.

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:47.600
In October 1915 Musical America
featured 27 noted concert artists

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:51.200
who listed their 10
favorite American songs.

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:56.000 position:56%
Six of these singers listed songs
by Burleigh, of the other 21 singers

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.770
at least 10 performed
Burleigh's songs at various times.

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:04.330
When Zabetta Brenska, a
contralto who often performed

00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:07.890
with her husband, tenor
Paul Althouse was asked

00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:11.390
to name her favorite American
song, she found it difficult

00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:15.170
to choose only one, but she said
if I had to narrow my choice

00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:20.600
down to one composer I should
select Harry Burleigh's songs.

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:25.150 position:56%
Most of Burleigh's more than 100 art
songs did not announce his identity

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:28.130
as an African-American though
some were setting of verse

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:30.110
by African-American poets.

00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:34.090
They were songs about love,
beauty, nature, universal themes

00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:38.160
that have occupied poets
and composers for centuries.

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:43.160 position:56%
But Burleigh's penultimate published
art song is definitely a black

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:44.670
pride song.

00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:49.650
His setting of the Langston Hughes
poem, Lovely Dark and Lonely one.

00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:53.030
I've given you the
lyrics on your handout.

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:56.990
Burleigh wrote it with Marianne
Anderson's voice in mind,

00:36:56.990 --> 00:37:00.570
but I don't know that she
ever performed it publicly.

00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:04.300
Anderson's approach to the
racial divide was to bridge it

00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:08.510
through her own very
personal dignity and grace.

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:10.970
But I believe it is
a fitting combination

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:13.610
of Burleigh's art song catalogue.

00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:16.710
Along with his setting
of the John Oxenham hymn,

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:19.610
In Christ there is no East or West,

00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:24.260
based on a spiritual the
angels changed my name.

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:27.140
Samual Clorage Taylor
had arranged this song

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:32.290
for his 1905 piano
collection, 24 Negro Melodies.

00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:34.200 position:56%
The hymn, In Christ there is no East

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:38.090
of West affirms Burleigh's
life-long hope

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:41.390
that through their art
African-American would help

00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:44.530
to heal America's deepest wounds.

00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:47.640
We need that healing
now more than ever.

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:50.880
I've given you the lyrics to
both of these songs but what

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:53.290
of the spiritual arrangements?

00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:57.920
As early as 1901 Burleigh
was recognized as a promoter

00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:03.440
of the intrinsic, artistic worth of
African-American traditional music.

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:06.880
In his recitals he always
performed at least one set

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:10.810
of songs reflecting
this music heritage.

00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:15.550
And as early as 1903 his own
arrangements of spirituals.

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:18.940
This was more than a decade before
he began to publish the solo

00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:21.990
and choral arrangements for
which we now know him today.

00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:25.430
I've given you a copy
of a recital program

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:29.490
from 1908 that illustrates this.

00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:34.150
In 1901 the Chap Book, everybody's
magazine published three Burleigh's

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:38.820
settings of plantation verse
written by Maria Howard Weeden.

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:42.400
She published it under
the name Howard Weeden.

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:48.600
The editor's note accompanying each
song shows that as early as 1901,

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:50.970
nine years after he
arrived in New York city,

00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:53.520
Burleigh was championing
the artistic value

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:55.590
of African-American music.

00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:59.440
This is a quote, Mr. Burleigh
well known as a baritone

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:04.730
at St. George's church New York and
as a composer has long been working

00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:09.730 position:56%
to show that the true Negro music is
really worthy of serious attention.

00:39:09.730 --> 00:39:12.660
And is by no means
adequately represented

00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:14.840
by the cheap Koontz
[phonetic] songs that have

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:18.710
so much vogue, end of quote.

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:24.050
From 1900 to 1915 Burleigh often
accompanied Booker T. Washington

00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:26.710
on his tours through New
England raising money

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:29.030
for Tuskegee Institute.

00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:32.770
Burleigh's singing opened the
purse strings of wealthy donors.

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:34.760
It was in these appearances

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:38.100
that Burleigh developed his
arrangements of spirituals.

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:40.670
Wouldn't it be wonderful
to have video recordings

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:42.950 position:56%
of these improvisatory performances.

00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:47.600 position:56%
So we could study the development of
his style of arranging spirituals.

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:51.310
Burleigh's reputation of one
of the best American composers

00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:54.770
of art songs prepared for
the immediate reception

00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:57.240
of the spiritual arrangements
that were published

00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:01.980
in the 1916, 1917 concert season.

00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:05.470
Many of the performers who were
singing his art songs now greeted

00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:08.640
his spiritual arrangements
with delight.

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:10.950 position:56%
Two singes played a significant role

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:15.080
in bringing Burleigh's spiritual
arrangements to the floor.

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:19.030
The contralto soloist at
Temple Emanuel was Mary Jordan,

00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:23.010
a renowned recitalist and opera
singer who performed a number

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:27.180
of Burleigh's art songs several
of which he dedicated to her.

00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:29.900
Burleigh dedicated his
arrangement of Deep River to Jordan

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:33.020
and she sang and recorded it.

00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:37.650
Baritone Oscar Seagle, the son of
a minster in Tennessee who had gone

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:39.690
to the camp meetings
with his father,

00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:42.310
had searched for appropriate
arrangements

00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:44.960 position:56%
of the songs he had learned to love.

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:47.880
When he found Burleigh's
arrangements he immediately made

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:51.490
them an important part
of his repertoire.

00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:56.680
In May 1917 Seagle ended a
recital in Brooklyn with a group

00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:58.890
of Burleigh's spiritual
arrangements.

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:02.720
Burleigh said he sang like
a black preacher preaches.

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:06.630
And other singers followed Seagle's
example by ending their programs

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:09.230
with a group of spirituals.

00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:12.010
Now Burleigh's solo
appearances shifted

00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:15.350
to lecture recitals
on the spirituals.

00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:18.870
And in the late 1920's
as radio waves began

00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:23.300
to cover the country Burleigh's
voice was heard from the east

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:26.690
to the Midwest and as
far south as Texas.

00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:30.860
Singing spirituals and speaking
about their history and importance

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:35.870
to American history, we need
a doctoral dissertation to see

00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:40.650
when recordings first started to
be made of those radio programs.

00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:44.620 position:56%
Let's listen to a high school choir,
the Central Islip concert choir

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:47.830
from New York State, singing
Burleigh's choral arrangement

00:41:47.830 --> 00:41:50.510
from arrangement of,
My Lord What a Morning.

00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:57.510
[ Background noise ]

00:41:57.510 --> 00:45:34.040
[ Music ]

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:39.040
You notice that is not --
there is no accompaniment.

00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:42.000
Burleigh's choral arrangements were
mostly meant to be sung acapella

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.760
and they're not easy, so this
is a really wonderful choir.

00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:50.800
The St. George's annual vesper
service of Negro spirituals

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:54.650
which began in 1924
drew overflow crowds,

00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:56.930 position:56%
sometimes the police needed to help.

00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:59.220
The newspaper announced
them ahead of time

00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:02.480
and carried extensive
reviews afterward.

00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:04.920
This is the program
for the first of them,

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:07.790
it was Burleigh's 30th
anniversary at St. George's

00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:16.190 position:56%
and they featured Burleigh as he
appeared in 1894 and his 1924 photo.

00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:20.470
The programs always featured choral
and solo arrangements by Burleigh

00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:23.540
and came to include other
arrangements by other composers

00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:26.830
such as Hall Johnson,
Nathanial Dett, Eva Jesse,

00:46:26.830 --> 00:46:29.300
John Work and Florence Price.

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:33.110
These annual service
continued until 1955,

00:46:33.110 --> 00:46:37.430
six years after Burleigh
died in 1949.

00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:42.200
It is impossible to overestimate
the importance of the emergence

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:46.610
of Burleigh's art song spiritual
arrangements 100 years ago.

00:46:46.610 --> 00:46:49.440
Other composers black and
white immediately followed

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:55.020
with their own arrangements and by
1925 James Weldon Johnson commented

00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:58.170
that the spirituals had a vogue.

00:46:58.170 --> 00:47:01.440
At first Burleigh's arrangements
were used more extensively by white

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:05.380
than by black singers but
the enthusiastic reception

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:08.800
of his arrangements was noted
within the black community.

00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:12.510
The 1917 Spingarn Award
acknowledged his contribution

00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:14.920
in bringing the spirituals
to the attention

00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:19.320
of the distinguished audiences
nationwide and in Europe.

00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:23.760
The honorary master of arts degree
from Atlanta University in 1918

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:27.140
and the honorary Doctor
of Music degree

00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:29.720
from Howard University in 1920.

00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:35.720 position:56%
Also recognized his role in helping
African-Americans reclaim spirituals

00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:39.930
as an artistic heritage, rescuing
them from their association

00:47:39.930 --> 00:47:42.040
with minstrelsy and vaudeville.

00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:45.690
And making them accessible
to singers, and music lovers

00:47:45.690 --> 00:47:47.140
of every cultural background.

00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:48.440
And that was very important
to Burleigh.

00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:54.800
In his prefaces to the two books of
American Negro spirituals published

00:47:54.800 --> 00:48:00.670
in 1925 and 1926, James Walden
Johnson went so far as to say

00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:04.190
that Burleigh's work had
been the principle factor

00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:05.850
in reclaiming the spiritual

00:48:05.850 --> 00:48:09.780
as a universally valuable
artistic expression.

00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:13.570
This process had helped
African-American artists develop a

00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:15.600
black esthetic.

00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:20.850
The emergence of these artists
and I quote, zealous to be racial

00:48:20.850 --> 00:48:24.010
or to put it better, to
be true to themselves,

00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:28.600
to look for their artistic material
within rather than with out.

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:32.240
Got its first impulse
from the new evaluation

00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:36.070
of the spiritual reached
by the Negro himself.

00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:40.430
Almost suddenly the
realization broke upon the Negro

00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:45.140
that in the spirituals the race had
produced one of the finest examples

00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:47.930
of folk art in the world.

00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:53.330
The result was a leaping pride,
coupled with the consciousness

00:48:53.330 --> 00:48:58.150
of innate racial talents and powers
that gave rise to a new school

00:48:58.150 --> 00:49:01.300
of Negro artists, end of quote.

00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:04.170
The new vogue that the
spirituals enjoyed crowned

00:49:04.170 --> 00:49:07.790
in Johnson's words a long
and steady development

00:49:07.790 --> 00:49:10.600
in the recognition of their worth.

00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:14.860
This swelling interest and pride in
the spirituals released new levels

00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:18.900
of creativity among black
artists in the movement now known

00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:20.250
as the Harlem Renaissance.

00:49:20.250 --> 00:49:22.590
Or as some of its leaders
preferred to call it.

00:49:22.590 --> 00:49:26.910
The New Negro Renaissance, that
extended far beyond Harlem.

00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:30.350
At the end of his life
Burleigh expressed regret

00:49:30.350 --> 00:49:33.790
that his many art songs
had fallen out of use.

00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:37.520
But he took satisfaction in
the continuing popularity

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:39.810
of his spiritual arrangements.

00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:44.230
He had helped to ensure that what
he called this great free fountain

00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:47.970
of pure melody would
continue to flow.

00:49:47.970 --> 00:49:51.790
That the spirituals with their
message of hope for freedom

00:49:51.790 --> 00:49:55.820
and human family hood
would continue to be sung.

00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:59.230
His work had helped in
the image he often used

00:49:59.230 --> 00:50:03.250
to unlock the musical
treasure of the spiritual.

00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:07.680
He had helped to coin that
treasure in universal currency.

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:10.540
He had as Antonin Dvorak
urged helped

00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:13.510
to give those melodies
to the world, thank you.

00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:18.640
[ Applause ]

00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:21.510
Do you have questions or comments?

00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:27.020
[ Background noise ]

00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:32.300
&gt;&gt; Just wondering if there are any
extent recordings of him singing?

00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:37.960
&gt;&gt; Dr. Jean E. Snyder: That's
a good question, Dr. Burleigh,

00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:41.710
Harry T. Burleigh, II would always
tell people that there wasn't one

00:50:41.710 --> 00:50:45.160
but when I asked him I think
he knew that I knew and he sort

00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:50.030 position:56%
of took a deep breath and said well,
there was one but he didn't like it.

00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:57.610
It was recorded in 1919, this is
very early in recording technology.

00:50:57.610 --> 00:51:02.110
Now as long as Dr. Burleigh was
alive I referred people to him.

00:51:02.110 --> 00:51:08.710 position:56%
He's no longer with us but someone
has posted that recording on YouTube

00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:11.180
and the problem for me is

00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:14.590
that I don't think Burleigh
sounded to his audiences.

00:51:14.590 --> 00:51:19.580
I think the technology was
intimidating and I don't think --

00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:21.750
he sounds stilted in that recording

00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:23.920
and I don't think that's the
way he sounded to his audiences.

00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:31.380 position:56%
The reviews are glowing in
describing his engaging performance.

00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:35.660
So, unfortunately he would never
agree to another recording,

00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:41.180
he did accompany Edward
Boltner on another recording

00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:46.720
and these were made by the George
W. Broom recording company.

00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:49.840
And Broom was one of
Burleigh's friends,

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:53.550
this was the earliest
black recording company.

00:51:53.550 --> 00:51:59.580
There were recordings made at
the 50th anniversary in 1946

00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:03.690
but obviously Burleigh's voice was
long past his prime by that time

00:52:03.690 --> 00:52:07.690
and those recordings were not made
public, they were made available

00:52:07.690 --> 00:52:11.840
to people at St. George's, people
who sang with him in the choir.

00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:13.140
I haven't seen those

00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:18.240
but unfortunately we don't have a
recording of how he really sounded.

00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:28.440
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] history of it
[inaudible] since Burleigh's time

00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:29.740
and enter to the modern world.

00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:32.430
Because I know we've gone through
periods of people you know,

00:52:32.430 --> 00:52:37.510
making it more white in terms of
pronunciation of the language.

00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:39.090
&gt;&gt; Dr. Jean E. Snyder: Are you
talking about the use of dialect?

00:52:39.090 --> 00:52:40.390
&gt;&gt; Yes, dialect.

00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:41.690
&gt;&gt; Dr. Jean E. Snyder: Yes, okay.

00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:45.250
Burleigh commented that the
dialect softened the harshness

00:52:45.250 --> 00:52:47.540
of the Anglo-Saxon language.

00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:49.540
Some of his spiritual
arrangements are written

00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:52.730
in what we call standard
English, some of them use dialect.

00:52:52.730 --> 00:52:55.370
He didn't think -- he acknowledged

00:52:55.370 --> 00:52:58.280
that the dialect had been
caricatured but he didn't think

00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:01.930
that was a reason not to use it.

00:53:01.930 --> 00:53:03.300
He was always concerned

00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:07.280
that spirituals be
performed with dignity.

00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:09.570
And if you see any of his
spiritual arrangements

00:53:09.570 --> 00:53:13.060
in their original publication
there was always

00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:17.070
in the inside front cover a
statement by Burleigh of how

00:53:17.070 --> 00:53:21.880
to perform the spirituals,
with dignity and respect.

00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:25.590
He didn't think that only
black people could sing them,

00:53:25.590 --> 00:53:30.500
there was an interview of
Burleigh and his son Alston.

00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:31.800
In which they talked about the fact

00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:34.850
that some black singers don't
know how to sing spirituals

00:53:34.850 --> 00:53:36.810
and there are white people
that sing them better.

00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:41.550
The important thing is the
heart, the understanding

00:53:41.550 --> 00:53:44.140
and presenting them with dignity.

00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:46.210
Does that -- yes.

00:53:46.210 --> 00:53:51.280
&gt;&gt; Thank you for the comment on
the Burleigh recording I was going

00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:53.220
to ask something about that.

00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:56.980
Maybe you said this, it is of
his arrangement of Go Down Moses.

00:53:56.980 --> 00:53:58.750
&gt;&gt; Dr. Jean E. Snyder: Yes,
I didn't say that, thank you.

00:53:58.750 --> 00:54:03.770
&gt;&gt; That's the one you
recorded, actually it's in a --

00:54:03.770 --> 00:54:07.670
if any of you want to get a
CD of it, it can be purchased,

00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:10.950
it's on a two CD set
called, Lost Sounds.

00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:14.830
Issued by the Arceophone label

00:54:14.830 --> 00:54:17.170
and that's how they got
the upload to YouTube.

00:54:17.170 --> 00:54:21.650
My guess, he sounds stilted
I think he wanted to be sure

00:54:21.650 --> 00:54:25.240
that the primitive of technology
picked all the pronunciation

00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:27.320
of the word, so he
over did it a bit.

00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:28.620
&gt;&gt; Dr. Jean E. Snyder: Yeah.

00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:29.920
&gt;&gt; But at least it's something.

00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:33.260
&gt;&gt; Dr. Jean E. Snyder: Thank you
and that of course is the recording

00:54:33.260 --> 00:54:36.960
that accompanies Lost
Sounds by Tim Brooks.

00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:39.400
&gt;&gt; It's based on the book, yes.

00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:40.990
&gt;&gt; Dr. Jean E. Snyder:
And that's history

00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:43.860 position:56%
of recorded sound African-Americans.

00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:47.330
&gt;&gt; So I had a few questions
I'll try and do them quickly,

00:54:47.330 --> 00:54:52.310
that 1893 interview with Dvorak
you mentioned, he also referred

00:54:52.310 --> 00:54:57.520
to Indian or Native American music
as being another possible source

00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:00.320
for an American national music.

00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:03.830
That didn't go quite as far as
African-American but I wondered

00:55:03.830 --> 00:55:07.070
if by chance Burleigh ever
thought of that source.

00:55:07.070 --> 00:55:08.970
The reason I ask that is at least

00:55:08.970 --> 00:55:12.570
to my ears the song
Ethiopia Saluting the Colors,

00:55:12.570 --> 00:55:15.540
sounds slightly Native
American as well.

00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:17.580
&gt;&gt; Dr. Jean E. Snyder: You're not
the first person that said that.

00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:19.870
I worked through these
songs with James Sample

00:55:19.870 --> 00:55:23.950
who was a retired conductor
and he didn't like that song,

00:55:23.950 --> 00:55:27.540
Ethiopia Saluting the Colors and
he commented that those chords

00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:35.690
at the beginning, that
was typical Indian music.

00:55:35.690 --> 00:55:41.710
But yeah, Burleigh commented,
he was interviewed in 1911

00:55:41.710 --> 00:55:45.290
when there was a performance
of the New World Symphony

00:55:45.290 --> 00:55:50.270
about his relationship with
Dvorak and his influence.

00:55:50.270 --> 00:55:52.480
And the influence

00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:55.310
of African-American
music on Dvorak writing.

00:55:55.310 --> 00:56:01.110
And he said you know, there was
a time when people understood

00:56:01.110 --> 00:56:05.770
and recognized that I had worked
with Dvorak and had influenced him

00:56:05.770 --> 00:56:07.680
but now people seemed
to have forgotten that.

00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:11.510
But he did comment in that
interview and it's in the book.

00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:16.990
He did comment about Dvorak's
interest in Native American music

00:56:16.990 --> 00:56:20.500
and the influence that, that also
had on the New World Symphony.

00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:21.800
&gt;&gt; Definitely.

00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:26.370
Are there any extent
recordings or transcriptions

00:56:26.370 --> 00:56:27.880
of those radio talks he gave?

00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:29.530
&gt;&gt; Dr. Jean E. Snyder:
That's what I don't know,

00:56:29.530 --> 00:56:31.720
somebody needs to find that out.

00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:34.520
&gt;&gt; And did he ever get to
meet Samuel Coleridge Taylor?

00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:35.820
&gt;&gt; Dr. Jean E. Snyder: Yes, he did,

00:56:35.820 --> 00:56:37.320
in fact yeah that's
an interesting story.

00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:42.680 position:56%
He met him in London but he also and
Dvorak, when Coleridge Taylor came

00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:47.060
to the United States
in 1904, 1906 and 1910,

00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:50.070
he sang and he travelled with.

00:56:50.070 --> 00:56:55.540 position:56%
In fact he arranged the tour in
1906 which came to Pittsburg as well

00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:57.370
as a number of other places.

00:56:57.370 --> 00:56:58.840
Yeah, they were good friends

00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:03.780
and there's interesting
correspondence between them.

00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:07.200
In fact Coleridge Taylor called
Burleigh the greatest singer

00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:09.750
of my songs.

00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:13.750 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Something I just wanted to throw
in that goes along with the question

00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:15.760
about whether there
were any recordings.

00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:19.820
Over the years my father obviously
had heard his grandfather sing

00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:22.500
but had heard a lot of
other people sing his work.

00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:26.840
And he said that Oral Moses
sounded more like his grandfather

00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:28.940
than anyone else he'd ever heard.

00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:31.750
So if you want to get a better
feel for what the old man sounded

00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:35.400
like listen to some recordings
that Dr. Oral Moses did.

00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:37.510
&gt;&gt; Dr. Jean E. Snyder: It's called
Deep River, Songs and spirituals

00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:39.640
by Harry T. Burleigh,
you got it, great.

00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:43.130
Yes, it's published now,
it was originally issued

00:57:43.130 --> 00:57:45.590
by Northeastern records
but it's been reissued

00:57:45.590 --> 00:57:52.830
by Albany records and
it's easy to get.

00:57:52.830 --> 00:57:56.460
I beg your pardon?

00:57:56.460 --> 00:58:00.410
Oral Moses, O-r-a-l
Moses, the bass-baritone

00:58:00.410 --> 00:58:06.280
from Kennesaw University
in Marietta, Georgia.

00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:09.340
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much for
playing that beautiful recording

00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:12.380
of My Lord What a Morning.

00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:16.260
I actually had the opportunity
to participate in a performance

00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:19.290 position:56%
of that same arrangement in a series

00:58:19.290 --> 00:58:21.680
of concerts last year
in New York City.

00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:26.170
St. Bart's, Brooklyn
Cathedral, a few others.

00:58:26.170 --> 00:58:31.280
We also did the Hall Johnson
arrangement of, When I was Sinking

00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:34.640
Down and you're right
it's very challenging

00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:37.190 position:56%
with the acapella setting like that.

00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:41.140
But my colleague Diane
Sayer conducted it

00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:45.060
and ironically it was part
of a concert which was joined

00:58:45.060 --> 00:58:50.430
with the Mozart Requiem on the
anniversary of September 11.

00:58:50.430 --> 00:58:53.370
And it was a huge audience
and it was very emotional

00:58:53.370 --> 00:58:57.050
but it was amazing
to see how starting

00:58:57.050 --> 00:59:02.770
with that setting captured the
audience and in a colloquial,

00:59:02.770 --> 00:59:07.210
in an English language of
beautiful classical piece

00:59:07.210 --> 00:59:08.740
of music that Burleigh did.

00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:12.550
And then brought them into this
performance of Mozart's Requiem.

00:59:12.550 --> 00:59:20.560
So it was an amazing
experience, I wanted to mention

00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:24.220
that as I said this choir
which performed that is going

00:59:24.220 --> 00:59:28.580 position:56%
to be participating in a performance

00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:33.260
in Carnegie Hall this coming
June 29, which is going

00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:39.070
to be a 100 birthday celebration
of Mrs. Silvia Olden Lee.

00:59:39.070 --> 00:59:40.370
&gt;&gt; Dr. Jean E. Snyder:
And I'll be there.

00:59:40.370 --> 00:59:43.850
&gt;&gt; Wonderful and it's
going to be joined,

00:59:43.850 --> 00:59:46.370
this is the Schiller
Institute Choir, the Foundation

00:59:46.370 --> 00:59:50.510 position:56%
for the revival of classical culture
and the Harlem Opera Theater.

00:59:50.510 --> 00:59:51.810
&gt;&gt; Dr. Jean E. Snyder:
That's wonderful.

00:59:51.810 --> 00:59:55.160
&gt;&gt; And it's I think going to
include some of the performances

00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:58.240
of Harry Burleigh's choral
settings and also some

00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:01.000
of the solo settings
of the spirituals, so.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.300
Thank you very much.

01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:03.600
&gt;&gt; Dr. Jean E. Snyder: That's
great, thank is so much.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:06.420
Silvia Olden Lee if you
don't know was a coach

01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:08.880
at the Metropolitan Opera
and she coached people

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:11.240
like Kathleen Battle
and lots of others.

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:17.360 position:56%
Very important person and Adolphus
Hailstork has written a song called,

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:20.480
Who is Silvia?

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:22.760
It's great.

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:27.850
I wanted to say you can also find
a Mormon Tabernacle Choir recording

01:00:27.850 --> 01:00:31.440
of this song but I love that
high school choir singing,

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:33.060
they do it so beautifully.

01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:42.530
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: There's time for
one more, if anyone got one, yes.

01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:49.120
&gt;&gt; I just wondered about,
thank you, I just wondered

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:53.040 position:56%
about Louise Burleigh because that's
a fascinating part of the story.

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:55.670
&gt;&gt; Dr. Jean E. Snyder: It is a
fascinating part of the story,

01:00:55.670 --> 01:01:00.910
Louise Alston Burleigh was
considerably younger than Burleigh

01:01:00.910 --> 01:01:06.880
but they met, I'm not sure when
they met but Burleigh sang in D.C.,

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:12.630 position:56%
she was born and raised in Brooklyn
which is now part of the Washington,

01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:18.110
D.C. I think when they
married they hoped

01:01:18.110 --> 01:01:21.360
to have a creative partnership,

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:27.060
but eventually I think the stage
wasn't big enough for both of them.

01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:33.950 position:56%
And first she wrote a lot of dialect
poetry which she was very successful

01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:38.650
in doing readings of her poems.

01:01:38.650 --> 01:01:44.290
But the marriage, they were
separated I think in 1913,

01:01:44.290 --> 01:01:46.440
the marriage ended in 1915.

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:49.320
And she had discovered
another part of her heritage

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:51.490
which was Native American.

01:01:51.490 --> 01:01:58.280
And she left New York city with
an Indian man named Albert,

01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:01.360
his last name is escaping me.

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:06.110
She settled in the
Dells in Wisconsin

01:02:06.110 --> 01:02:14.220
where she had a little cabin and
she became Princess Nadonis Shawa.

01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:15.530
And she could get away with it

01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:22.440
because she was a very
credible Indian princess.

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:27.750
But she couldn't allow anyone
to know that her husband

01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:30.030
and her son were African-Americans

01:02:30.030 --> 01:02:36.000 position:56%
because she couldn't have owned
property and she was very successful

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.330
in [inaudible] programs
and [inaudible].

01:02:39.330 --> 01:02:45.310
But her life was very separate
from her husband and her son.

01:02:45.310 --> 01:02:52.560
That caused problems at his death
in claiming some of his estate.

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:56.250
That's another story,
it's told in the book.

01:02:56.250 --> 01:02:59.630
Yeah, it's you know,
it's an American story,

01:02:59.630 --> 01:03:08.310 position:56%
her audiences didn't understand
enough about Native American culture

01:03:08.310 --> 01:03:13.150
to know that what she was
presenting was her fiction.

01:03:13.150 --> 01:03:18.130
And she was a very fine performer.

01:03:18.130 --> 01:03:23.960
She commented in a letter to her
son that she would have liked

01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:26.290
to be a vaudeville performer.

01:03:26.290 --> 01:03:29.990
So you know, there ways diverged.

01:03:35.830 --> 01:03:38.130
Yes, sure.

01:03:41.830 --> 01:03:45.160
&gt;&gt; His mother was a
college graduate, right.

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:46.830
&gt;&gt; Dr. Jean E. Snyder: Yes, she
graduated from Avery College.

01:03:46.830 --> 01:03:50.660
&gt;&gt; How did that influence
and inspire him to be able

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:52.130
to go forward [inaudible].

01:03:52.130 --> 01:03:57.600
&gt;&gt; Dr. Jean E. Snyder: No question,
this was an abolitionist college

01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:01.530
and it wasn't the first
college for African-Americans

01:04:01.530 --> 01:04:06.470
but it was probably the first that
had an African-American faculty.

01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:10.760
And it was a classical education,
she learned Greek and French

01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:13.980 position:56%
and Latin at her graduation she gave

01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:18.480
as the Pittsburgh Newspaper
said, an essay in French.

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:24.350
And she was very good at
it, she also gave a speech

01:04:24.350 --> 01:04:29.620
in which she adverted in terms
of sorrow to the many people

01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:32.360 position:56%
of her race who were still enslaved.

01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:37.810
She was a very well educated woman
and the Erie papers, pick up,

01:04:37.810 --> 01:04:44.880
the Pittsburgh story and said
oh, she's qualified to teach

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:47.970
in the best seminary in the land
but could she get a job teaching

01:04:47.970 --> 01:04:49.270
at the Erie public school?

01:04:49.270 --> 01:04:52.560
No, she could get a job as janitor.

01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:58.480
But two of her daughters
became teachers

01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:01.700
in the Erie public
school in the 1890's.

01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:08.630
Burleigh's sister Eva was hired in
1890 and Burleigh's half-sister,

01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:16.770
Bessie Elmendorf Marshall
taught music in the school

01:05:16.770 --> 01:05:20.000 position:56%
where her mother had been janitress.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.620
So but she taught for a number
of years in the colored school

01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:28.640
which was established partly
by her father, Hamilton Waters.

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:31.420
There were sometimes 300
students in that school,

01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:37.530
so she was very gifted,
but frustrated.

01:05:37.530 --> 01:05:40.960
&gt;&gt; Do you know if Burleigh
knew Emily Beech?

01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:43.630
&gt;&gt; Dr. Jean E. Snyder: I don't
know if he knew her personally,

01:05:43.630 --> 01:05:50.500
he sang some of her songs and
interesting when Dvorak made

01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:57.670
that startling statement someone
interviewed European composers

01:05:57.670 --> 01:06:00.820
and Boston composers of
whom Emily Beech was one,

01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:03.360
she was one of the boys.

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:09.570
And she said well, I'm not a Native
American or an African-American I'm

01:06:09.570 --> 01:06:13.290
from Scotch Irish ancestry.

01:06:13.290 --> 01:06:21.530
And she wrote her Celtic symphony
as a direct kind of reflection

01:06:21.530 --> 01:06:27.720
of Dvorak's New World Symphony, it
was in the same key but she quoted

01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:31.800
and wrote in the style
of Celtic folksongs.

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:34.960
I don't know, it would be
really interesting to know

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:39.120
if they ever met personally,
I don't know that.

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:41.650 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Well, thank you all
so much for being here and thank you

01:06:41.650 --> 01:06:43.510
to Dr. Snyder for sharing.

01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:50.050
[ Applause ]

01:06:50.050 --> 01:06:53.710
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
