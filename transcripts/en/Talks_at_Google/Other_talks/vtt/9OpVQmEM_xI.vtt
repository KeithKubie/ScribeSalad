BRE PETTIS: Thank you.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.497
So I was here almost
exactly five years ago.

00:00:11.497 --> 00:00:13.080
It might have actually
been May, 2009.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.500
I tried to look on my calendar.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.570
I couldn't find it.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.920
It was so far back.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.990
And I was introduced
by this guy,

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.612
and he said,
replicators start here.

00:00:24.612 --> 00:00:26.570
And that was before we
even called the MakerBot

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:27.900
a replicator.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.034
And so I thought, OK.

00:00:29.034 --> 00:00:30.450
Like, I watched
this this morning.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.210
I was like, this is kind of
like a really neat full circle

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.970
moment, because five years ago
we were three guys, a laser

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.470
cutter, and a dream.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.960
And we'd gotten ourselves
into-- we really thought

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.700
five years ago that we would
start a business that we could

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.660
do in like 10 or 12 hours
a week on this side.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.290
And we probably
had two employees.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.350
So there were probably
five of us at that point.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.930
And now we're 500-- merged
with the public company.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:08.490
And this is what a 3D printed
bunny looked like on a MakerBot

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.260
at that moment.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.920
And we were so proud.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.320
We were like, this kind
of looks like a bunny.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.480
This is great!

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.895
And now we have 100
micron layer resolution,

00:01:22.895 --> 00:01:26.320
and it's kind of
absurd that it works.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.260
And a MakerBot replicator will
go head-to-head with a $300,000

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.270
mainframe-size machine
and kick it's butt.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:45.280
And any company that does
product design probably

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.710
has a MakerBot.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:54.080
Car companies, phone
companies, basically

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.680
anybody who's making
stuff uses MakerBot.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.580
And it basically takes
the way you used to do it

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.190
and smushes it up.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.770
So the way people use
to do product design is

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.615
they used to have an idea,
and then make a design,

00:02:06.615 --> 00:02:07.490
and then send it out.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.989
And it would take three weeks
or a month to do an iteration.

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.580
You'd get it back and
be like, the ears are

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.840
too long, or this
needs more cowbell,

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.725
or whatever you wanted to say.

00:02:18.725 --> 00:02:19.850
And then you'd do it again.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.810
And with a three or four
week turnaround time,

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.340
you could iterate
multiple times a year.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.690
When engineers get a MakerBot
and they put on their desk,

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.840
they iterate
multiple times a day.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.410
So it means, one,
because it's affordable,

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.160
and because two, the material's
affordable, and three,

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.700
we've made it easy to use-- good
UX/UI, which nobody-- probably

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.650
this is the best room that
understands how important UX/UI

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:48.150
is.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.200
Anyhow, it basically makes it so
that people can try things out.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.340
They can explore.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.340
They can make something.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.131
And they don't even
have to show their boss

00:03:00.131 --> 00:03:01.260
if they don't like it.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.900
They can just be like,
oh, this was a bad idea.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.690
Chuck it under the
desk in the bin.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:06.990
Do it again.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.990
Do it again.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.020
It's not a problem to try again.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.530
And that's probably been
one of the coolest things

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.580
to see as we've grown the
company is watching all

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.230
of the awesome MakerBot
operators in the world

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.630
take the technology and do way
cooler stuff than we could ever

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:24.220
have imagined.

00:03:27.554 --> 00:03:28.970
So when we talk
about MakerBot, we

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.942
talk about being an
innovation company.

00:03:30.942 --> 00:03:32.900
I talked a lot about what
companies do with it.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.566
The cool thing is
it's affordable enough

00:03:34.566 --> 00:03:40.300
that when we started it was
seriously early, early, early,

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.030
adopters-- Google bought
two of the first batch.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.650
Thank you for supporting
us back in the day

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.110
--and now it's
ordinary people who

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.540
just need more brackets
for their kitchen

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.954
will get a MakerBot.

00:03:54.954 --> 00:03:56.370
All of it has to
do is innovation.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.328
And we like to say we're
an innovation company.

00:03:58.328 --> 00:04:02.090
We innovate so that
everybody else can innovate.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.920
And back in the day if you
wanted to make something,

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.530
this is an injection
molding machine

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.830
it's probably a 210 ton press.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.640
And pellets go in one
side, and there's basically

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.370
two big pieces of metal
that are a mold that goes

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:24.080
[CRUSHING NOISE], with that
kind of noise and cranks

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.860
out plastic stuff all day long.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.250
About 40 or 50 MakerBots
will compete with that, just

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.900
for fun.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.335
But now you can have--
the way it used to be is

00:04:36.335 --> 00:04:37.835
it was just a lot
of infrastructure.

00:04:37.835 --> 00:04:40.740
You had to be a tycoon to own
that kind of infrastructure

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.340
to make things.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:49.710
Now you just need a freaking
laptop and a MakerBot,

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.810
and game is on.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.885
So when we talk about leaving
the next Industrial Revolution.

00:04:55.885 --> 00:04:57.850
The First Industrial
Revolution was really

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.540
around the factory--
moving from everybody

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.680
working on stuff in their
home to everybody going

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.380
to the factory,
centralized manufacturing.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.499
And it allowed everybody
to have things like spoons.

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:13.290
Well I'm sure people
had spoons beforehand.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.090
But you could produce
lots of spoons

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.445
at one time in a factory,
or garment making

00:05:17.445 --> 00:05:18.570
and all that kind of stuff.

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.540
The Second Industrial
Revolution is officially

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.742
classified as being around the
railroad and transportation.

00:05:25.742 --> 00:05:27.950
So when I talk about the
Third Industrial Revolution,

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.150
I like to talk about all
these tools basically

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.060
being on your desktop--
the tools of manufacturing.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.410
A MakerBot is a
manufacturing education

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:37.570
in a box on your desktop.

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.420
And we've been doing
it for five years.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.070
And so we built out
this 3D ecosystem.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.778
It's interesting.

00:05:44.778 --> 00:05:49.560
We actually started
Thingaverse-- thingaverse.com

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.010
is our website where people
share digital designs

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.620
--and we started Thingaverse
before we started MakerBot,

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:56.270
actually.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.910
And I'll talk about
that more later.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.590
But we've got all this
stuff around the 3D printer,

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.169
and in some ways
getting a 3D printer is

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:08.710
sort of your ticket into this
whole world that we've created.

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.920
And it's just way more
than just a 3D printer.

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.830
But the 3D printers are cool.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.116
These are our fifth
generation machines.

00:06:18.116 --> 00:06:20.240
You know, something about
having a black background

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.910
and black machines,
I think I just

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.515
didn't do it justice
on this slide.

00:06:27.324 --> 00:06:28.865
Important thing you
will need to know

00:06:28.865 --> 00:06:31.410
is that there's a small
version, a medium version,

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.590
and a ginormous version.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.320
The MakerBot
Replicator Mini makes

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.840
things that are about four
by four by five inches.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.890
So stuff you might
want to have at home,

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:46.520
or you could make for your kids.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.420
We're exploring the frontier
of consumer 3D printing, where

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.270
ordinary people just make
stuff instead of buying stuff.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.700
This is our sort of adventure.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.790
And the MakerBot Replicator
Mini is really our step

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.240
into the adventure
of making something

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:05.040
for people who aren't
engineers-- one-touch 3D

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.030
Printing.

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.470
The MakerBot Replicator,
which I've got up here,

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.480
is fifth generation
technology too.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.060
It's basically optimized
for the engineer,

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:19.666
the industrial designer,
the architects of the world.

00:07:19.666 --> 00:07:21.540
And the MakerBot Replicator
Z18 is ginormous.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:25.540
Norman build volume is 12 by
12 by 18 inches, so full-sized.

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:30.066
If you need a full-size replica
of your head, we're on it.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.090
What's interesting is anybody
who has had a 3D printer

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:41.610
or used 3D printing
before wants this one.

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:43.940
All the orders for
this are people

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:45.350
who already have 3D printers.

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:46.058
It's interesting.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.540
It shops in May, or
officially in spring,

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:54.540
so I can be flexible if
I need to push to June,

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.020
but it should be May.

00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:02.060
And it's going to be super
interesting to see what people

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:07.810
do when they have a
big-scale 3D printer.

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:11.730
And to get one of these-- it's
like the best volume to price

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:12.710
ratio.

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:16.560
If you want to geek out
on how awesome it is,

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:20.250
it just blows everything
else out of the water.

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:23.560
The cool thing is is that
even though we just came out

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.330
three new 3D printers, it's
kind of like we just came out

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:30.880
with one 3D printer, but
in three different sizes.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.890
They all have an onboard camera.

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:34.990
This means that you can
pull it up on your phone

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:41.090
and watch your model being made
from another part of your house

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:47.384
or the world, or if you're in
a space station, then fine.

00:08:47.384 --> 00:08:48.800
They all have this
smart extruder,

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:54.340
which just swaps in and out,
so if you need to replace it,

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:55.790
and it's got a
little brain in it,

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:57.920
so it knows when you
run out of filament

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.850
and sends a message
saying, I'm hungry.

00:09:02.907 --> 00:09:04.490
And they're all app
and cloud enabled.

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:07.790
I'm sorry this is an iPhone,
not an Android device.

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:14.980
The mobile platform launches
in about a month and a half,

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:16.650
and Android will
follow shortly after.

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:23.660
The MakerBot replicator and
the MakerBot replicator Z18

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:27.260
both have this
super-luscious LCD display.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:31.780
And there's nothing like going
from-- the MakerBot Replicator

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.140
2, which is our fourth
generation machine,

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:38.200
has a little alpha
alphanumeric display.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.950
And I've got to say, it's like
we're moving from flip phone

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:45.110
technology to
smartphone technology.

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:46.710
It's that big of a leap.

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:48.830
I'm like, yes.

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:50.640
More than whatever it is.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:54.105
More than 100 characters,
awesome, pictures, yes!

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:02.380
So the small one is, like
I said, for beginners.

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:05.210
It's got all the same things
that all of them have.

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:08.100
It doesn't have the display,
but you basically use your phone

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.640
as the control mechanism for it.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.620
And the MakerBot
Replicator-- kind

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:16.490
of getting redundant
here --huge build volume

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:18.860
for engineers, industrial
designers, architects.

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:22.270
And then this giant one's
just out of control.

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:24.630
This is a heated build
chamber to reduce curling.

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:27.430
If you've done 3D printing,
you've battled curling.

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:30.720
I can't say it makes it go away,
because it's something that

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:34.310
happens when you use a
thermoplastic where you heat it

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:36.130
up and you extrude it.

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:37.880
The way it works, if
you haven't seen one,

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.400
is it basically draws
a picture in plastic

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.510
and then draws another
picture on top of that,

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:44.600
and layer by layer
it makes your model.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.520
When you do really
big things-- all

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.910
thermoplastics shrink
when they cool.

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:53.460
And if they curl--
while it's being made,

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:54.850
it kind of curls
up at the edges,

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:58.417
so we've done a lot to reduce
that with this machine,

00:10:58.417 --> 00:10:59.000
in particular.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.833
Because with big things
it's more important,

00:11:00.833 --> 00:11:02.731
because if it shrinks
0.2% it doesn't really

00:11:02.731 --> 00:11:04.730
matter if it's just like
three centimeters long.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:08.980
But if it's 25 centimeters
long, you've got a problem.

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:14.190
So we make these in Brooklyn.

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:15.920
Can we give it up
for New York City?

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:25.020
So this actually is
really important.

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:28.130
We did a lot of research
into making them

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:29.820
in all sorts of places.

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:31.380
And it came down
that for us it was

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.810
most important that
the manufacturing

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:38.310
engineers, the design engineers,
could argue in the same place.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:47.370
And so we've got a facility
in Sunset Park, where

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:51.400
we've got a really ginormous
factory where we just

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.770
crank these out all
day long and ship them.

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:56.500
And it's interesting.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.860
I think when you do
a hardware startup

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:02.952
you have to love
packing and shipping.

00:12:02.952 --> 00:12:07.630
If you don't love packing and
shipping, go into software.

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:09.420
Well, you have to
ship in software too,

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:13.340
but it doesn't involve-- well,
I guess it does sometimes

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:17.280
involve physical stuff,
but it's different.

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.610
We love to pack and ship.

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:21.845
And it's funny--
when we started,

00:12:21.845 --> 00:12:23.220
when I was here
five years ago, I

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.110
did everything with my partners.

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:26.180
We did everything.

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:28.580
We laser cut the parts out.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:31.930
We call the suppliers
and grumped at them

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:32.800
if they were late.

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.770
We packed all the boxes,
put the stickers on them,

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:39.800
loaded up the UPS
trucks, and now I

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.160
have a whole team that
just loads UPS trucks.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.230
It's awesome.

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:45.270
It's one of the great
things about growing

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:49.790
is you're like, OK I don't
have to do it all anymore.

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:52.180
We get to have teams
of people do stuff.

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:54.070
So this is on our assembly line.

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:57.815
So what you can see here is that
there's parts for the MakerBot

00:12:57.815 --> 00:12:59.190
that come down
the assembly line.

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:02.210
And they come on these
sort of cafeteria trays.

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:03.870
And attached to
the cafeteria tray

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:07.090
are all these jigs and
fixtures made on a MakerBot.

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:09.570
There's more than
1,000 jigs and fixtures

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:13.920
at the MakerBot factory, which
are parts that we made on

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.700
on the MakerBot
to make MakerBots.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:21.260
And this is actually
one of those things

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.900
that 3D printers, and
MakerBots in particular,

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:30.850
are going to get used for
that is not as high-profile,

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:33.900
but is deep.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:37.080
Manufacturers, in general, when
they make jigs and fixtures,

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.750
generally have a
carpentry section.

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:42.370
And they just basically
set people up--

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:44.190
they set all there
stuff up, and instead

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:45.970
of having these
3D printed parts,

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:48.230
it's usually like pieces
of wood hammered together.

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:50.350
It's very piecemeal.

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:53.260
This is just so much easier
than doing anything else.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:57.370
I mean the other alternative is
to take a material like Delrin

00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:59.530
and mill it out and
make these things.

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:02.950
But when you start realizing
how much it costs to get time

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:10.380
on a milling machine, it's just
like-- if the manufacturers

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:15.220
hear this and watch
this Google Talk video,

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:18.040
and their ears get pricked
up, and they get it,

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:21.950
then our biggest customer may
not actually be consumers,

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:22.880
I'm planning on.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.420
It may end up
being manufacturers

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:26.910
that use this to streamline
their manufacturing facility.

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:37.290
So you know that
hardware doesn't

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:40.329
work unless software is great.

00:14:40.329 --> 00:14:42.870
And that's one of things that
if I'm anywhere and I say that,

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:45.790
you all will get this.

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:49.550
We've got a lot of
knockoffs, but most of them

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:53.590
do not understand that to
make some hardware work, you,

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:57.130
have to make it a great
experience for the end user.

00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:00.650
And that is almost
entirely software.

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:03.710
And so I love my software teams.

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:07.575
And MakerBot Desktop is an
application that you download.

00:15:07.575 --> 00:15:09.320
It sits on the desktop.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.960
And you get to enter the
world of MakerBot through it.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.880
You can explore Thingaverse.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.830
You can shop in the
MakerBot digital store.

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:20.500
You can plan your
model on a virtual

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:22.990
build plate, and send
it to the MakerBot

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:25.980
and make it a full build plate.

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:27.890
Inside MakerBot
desktop application

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:31.220
is the MakerWare, which is
the tool for-- basically,

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:33.370
you take it from whatever
design tool you use.

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:35.844
You can use anything.

00:15:35.844 --> 00:15:38.260
When I was here five years
ago, you owned Google SketchUp,

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.010
so I did a big thing on that.

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:46.920
Now you've sold that, but really
SketchUp, Pro/E, SolidWorks,

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:49.770
AutoDesk-- AutoDesk actually
has a great suite of stuff

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:52.880
if you're just getting
into it with 123D.

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:55.696
You can really make--
if you want it,

00:15:55.696 --> 00:15:57.070
there's really no
excuse anymore.

00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:59.470
It used to be you could
say, oh, I don't know CAD.

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:01.390
But now the tools
are easy enough

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:05.340
that you can get into it, even
if you've never done it before.

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:07.800
Easier than Photoshop, is
what I'm comfortable saying.

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:13.850
We've got it set up with a
cloud solution, so you drag,

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:16.539
and you can basically
organize all your models.

00:16:16.539 --> 00:16:18.330
You can organize all
the things you've ever

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:20.621
made on your MakerBot, so
you can see what you've made.

00:16:20.621 --> 00:16:22.700
If you want to make
it again, it's easy.

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:26.280
And we do 3D print monitoring
from this application, as well.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.780
And then you can
access Thingaverse.

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:31.320
Let's see.

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.190
I'll come back to Thingaverse.

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:37.689
Thingaverse may be the
coolest thing of all of this.

00:16:37.689 --> 00:16:38.980
Same thing with the mobile app.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:42.020
You can cruise everything,
monitor everything.

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:47.670
And we just announced it, and
we're about to ship PrintShop.

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:51.900
PrintShop is a tool
that is really--

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:55.100
if you want to design something,
we're making a bunch of tools

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:59.770
so if you can type you
can make a 3D model.

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:02.030
So you just type
this in to PrintShop,

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:05.240
and it makes a
three-dimensional sign

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:11.460
for your desktop, or
your door, or whatever.

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:13.250
And then we've also
got a bracelet maker,

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:15.880
so if you need to make
something for your sweetheart,

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.400
it's pretty easy.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.339
We made it easy.

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:20.420
That's the whole idea.

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:22.780
So many people-- I'm a
former school teacher,

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:27.170
and I taught in the arts, and
so many people go through,

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:30.320
particularly public school,
and come out thinking that they

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:33.485
can't do anything artistic,
because they didn't draw

00:17:33.485 --> 00:17:36.220
a house the same way that the
teacher wanted them to draw it,

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:39.020
or they didn't do
something the way they--

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:44.000
they got a C+ in creativity in
school for something that they

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.010
weren't even attached to.

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:50.060
If we can reignite-- if MakerBot
can have any part in reigniting

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:51.945
even just one
person's creativity,

00:17:51.945 --> 00:17:53.570
I feel like we'll
have been successful,

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:56.750
because there's just so
much that can happen when

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:59.640
one person gets engaged,
starts having ideas,

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.560
and starts making things happen.

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:05.010
So PrintShop is our answer
to get people who are just

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:08.121
beginning into this jump started
into the process of being

00:18:08.121 --> 00:18:08.620
creative.

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:18.390
I've also hired this
exceptionally bad ass team

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:21.650
of designers that
just make cool stuff.

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:26.257
So this is-- oh, we don't
have a picture of the--

00:18:26.257 --> 00:18:27.840
we've just got a
picture of the model.

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:34.710
This is actually a full-sized,
realistic samurai helmet, cuz.

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:42.630
And we've launched the
MakerBot digital store

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:46.110
to basically make it so that
anybody, even if you're not

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:50.470
a designer, can just go and
buy 3D models, make cool stuff,

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:53.720
make your family happy.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.060
We're doing entertainment,
and the next step,

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:58.180
we're going to a bunch
of practical stuff.

00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:00.560
But for right now
you can basically--

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.990
you get an immense
amount of cool models.

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:05.430
And we have a model
where you basically pay--

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:10.270
kind of like an app
store --$0.99 each,

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:14.920
or you could buy a
whole set for $9.99.

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.700
And then you can
then, of course, you

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:20.800
can paint them--
very satisfying.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.460
So this is a little
bit-- this is

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:24.800
about two or three months old.

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:28.230
There's significantly more
MakerBots in the world

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:30.920
than this, because,
like I said, we're

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.520
packing and shipping
like mad right now.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:34.712
And then-- oh good.

00:19:34.712 --> 00:19:36.170
Now I'm to the part
of my-- now I'm

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:38.732
talking about Thingaverse again.

00:19:38.732 --> 00:19:40.190
So Thingaverse is
what happens when

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:43.360
you take an engaged community
who make digital designs,

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.472
and you give them a
place to share things.

00:19:45.472 --> 00:19:46.430
We started Thingaverse.

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:50.800
And Thingaverse is still
place where-- It's actually

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.140
interesting
archive.org just crawl

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:56.320
the site and
archived everything.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:01.265
And it's something like more
than 100 gigs of just models.

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:08.490
So I think if you wanted to
make everything on Thingaverse

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:11.140
with one MakerBot, it
would probably take you

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:13.595
a couple hundred, if not a
couple thousand, lifetimes.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.470
So it's just make
the stuff you want.

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:22.620
So this is just so cool.

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.450
One of my favorite
things to do every day

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:26.140
is I go to Thingaverse.com,
our website,

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:30.460
and I'm just like a power-fan.

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:33.129
I like to look at everything
and see what's new in the world

00:20:33.129 --> 00:20:34.670
that you can make
today on a MakerBot

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:36.730
that you couldn't
make yesterday.

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:38.810
And, to be clear, we're
actually agnostic.

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:41.370
If you have a different
kind of 3D printer,

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:43.510
you can use the same
files, so do it.

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:45.060
There's a bunch of
stuff we're doing

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:47.740
to optimize it to make it
really easy for MakerBot users,

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:51.420
but whatever you've
got come and share.

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:53.150
And if you make cool
stuff share it here

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:54.483
if you're comfortable with that.

00:20:57.602 --> 00:20:59.560
It's a lot more than this
now, but there's just

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:02.080
a lot of digital designs.

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:08.281
And just a lot-- our AWS
bill is kind of absurd.

00:21:08.281 --> 00:21:10.280
This is a project, This
is the Robohand project.

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:15.630
This is every once in awhile
I got journalists asking me,

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:23.400
so you just make
tchotchkes right?

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:25.700
And I would have to
resist the impulse

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:27.620
to hit them in the face.

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:31.200
And then I'd tell
them about Robohand.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.600
So Robohand is a project.

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.260
It's a collaboration.

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:37.680
Two guys collaborated
to develop the hand

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:41.550
that you see on this
screen here for this kid.

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:46.360
And it's a prosthetic hand
that really anybody can use,

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:48.710
but it's optimized for kids.

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:50.829
Kids who are born with
amniotic band syndrome

00:21:50.829 --> 00:21:51.620
don't have fingers.

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:53.460
They have a palm,
but no fingers.

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:57.790
And they don't get prosthetics,
because they grow out

00:21:57.790 --> 00:22:00.570
of them like sneakers, and
they cost like $50,000.

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:06.000
So Robohand is like
$5 in material.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.855
And it will take you a
couple hours to print out.

00:22:08.855 --> 00:22:11.230
And it's basically great for
picking up balls, picking up

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:13.800
things, holding a pen.

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.910
There's a young
gentleman who went--

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:20.630
he has amniotic band syndrome
--he went to his school.

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:21.930
His name's Leon.

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:26.480
He used his school's MakerBot
to print out a Robohand.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:30.080
And we were interviewed in the
same place, and he was asked,

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.610
so are you going to change it?

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:33.170
And he's like, yeah.

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:36.380
I'm adding lasers.

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:41.140
So this kind of
transforms kids' lives.

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:44.590
Now they get to go to school,
and they're like Iron Man.

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:51.160
That's Leon there.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.136
He's caught a touchdown
with this thing.

00:22:56.094 --> 00:22:57.250
This is John Camp.

00:22:57.250 --> 00:23:00.980
This guy is hardcore.

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:02.230
He's at Lockheed Martin.

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:06.400
He's working on the James Webb
Space Telescope Project, which

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:10.570
is so cool if
you're a space nerd.

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:14.110
And they realized that
they had a problem.

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:18.650
They had the Space Telescope
in the cryo chamber--

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:21.650
I just like to say the
word "cryo chamber" --which

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:25.097
is super-cold, as close as
you can get to Kelvin chamber

00:23:25.097 --> 00:23:26.513
with all the air
sucked out of it.

00:23:26.513 --> 00:23:30.030
And the idea is
to simulate space.

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:32.980
And it stays there for like six
months, or something like this.

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:35.650
They realized while it
was in the cryo chamber

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:38.500
that there was a problem
that they had to fix.

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:43.600
And there was a chance
that with the tolerance

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.417
deck up cosmic rays could
get into the telescope

00:23:46.417 --> 00:23:47.250
and ruin the sensor.

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:55.370
They went ahead, and
they made a model.

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:56.950
The white stuff
that he's holding

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:59.026
is a model of the
part of the telescope

00:23:59.026 --> 00:24:00.650
that they were going
to have to modify.

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:04.810
And the green parts in
the photo are the parts

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:06.960
that they were going to
have to insert-- baffles.

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.690
Now, the tricky
part is it's a way

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:12.420
deep down in the depths
of it, and they're

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:16.730
going to have to send a
little snake camera down there

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:18.330
and use a bunch of tools.

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:21.562
So they printed out a
replica of the telescope.

00:24:21.562 --> 00:24:23.020
Printed out all
the parts that they

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:24.945
we're going to have
to update it with.

00:24:24.945 --> 00:24:27.320
Printed out replicas of the
tools they were going to use.

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.220
And they practiced
for a few months.

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:32.160
And when it came out of
the crowd chamber-- bam

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.940
--I guess it was like
a 20 minute procedure.

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:37.739
So he reckons it probably
saved them six months,

00:24:37.739 --> 00:24:39.405
because they were
able to do it while it

00:24:39.405 --> 00:24:40.446
was in the crowd chamber.

00:24:40.446 --> 00:24:43.944
And there's no official
amount that they saved,

00:24:43.944 --> 00:24:46.235
but it was probably millions
of dollars on the project.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.790
So cool.

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:54.710
And it's interesting, he
brought in MakerBots to do this.

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:58.050
And he's in a cubicle
a Lockheed Martin.

00:24:58.050 --> 00:25:01.960
And people are immediately
like, what's that sound?

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.740
Why do you get a MakerBot?

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:08.100
And so they sort of started
proliferating through.

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:10.854
And actually at JPL--
Jet Propulsion Laboratory

00:25:10.854 --> 00:25:12.770
--when they have to
prototype something that's

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:16.040
within the build
volume of a MakerBot,

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:17.450
they don't send it out first.

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:19.870
They just buy a MakerBot
for that engineer,

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:23.300
because it's cheaper than buying
one prototype in one part.

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:26.330
And it also is less
than the minimum

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:30.070
needed for
bureaucratic oversight

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:32.930
on the credit card, so protip.

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:40.020
Uncharted Play-- these
folks are in Poughkeepsie,

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:43.040
and they are awesome.

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:47.160
They are making tools
for the developing

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:50.500
worlds that basically are cool.

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:51.830
This is one of their things.

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:54.724
Do I have the-- no.

00:25:54.724 --> 00:25:57.560
They also make a jump rope,
that when you jump rope,

00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:03.640
it's got a USB socket
on the jump rope.

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:09.440
And 15 minutes of jumping rope
will charge your phone totally.

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.460
That seems not a lot
until you've actually

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:14.260
tried jumping rope
for 15 minutes.

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:17.620
But this is a ball
that has a gyro in it.

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:22.449
When you kick it around all day
it stores energy in a battery,

00:26:22.449 --> 00:26:24.240
and then you can do
your homework at night.

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:29.040
You can't really see
this photo very well,

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:31.370
but-- oh, it's a
shame --right next

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:36.902
to her are two
inserts for shoes.

00:26:36.902 --> 00:26:38.360
And they're like
the kind of things

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:41.301
you would get if your
feet were messed up,

00:26:41.301 --> 00:26:42.300
and you went the doctor.

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:43.267
What are those called?

00:26:43.267 --> 00:26:44.100
AUDIENCE: Orthotics.

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.160
BRE PETTIS: Orthotics, yes.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.310
Right next to her
are two orthotics.

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:52.280
She's super-happy
because she just

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:55.010
got back from the
amusement park.

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:58.150
She's 41 1/2 inches tall.

00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:00.910
Those orthotics don't
do anything for her feet

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:03.490
except make her
half an inch taller.

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:05.080
So she could right
all the rides.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:08.540
So basically this
is a MakerBot dad

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:12.980
who's like-- MakerBot
operators live for this moment.

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:14.900
Oh, you're not tall enough?

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:15.460
I got that.

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:22.970
Kacie Hultgren in New York City.

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:27.920
She is a set designer pioneering
3D-printed set design.

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:30.270
She's got shows on Broadway.

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:35.350
And she's a pioneer
in set design.

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:38.240
But then having a
bunch of MakerBots

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:41.087
stacked up in her closet
running 3D prints overnight.

00:27:41.087 --> 00:27:42.920
And the goes in and
argues with the director

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:46.230
about what the set
should look like.

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:48.740
She's also a pioneer--
all the stuff she makes,

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:51.034
because it's all period
furniture models.

00:27:51.034 --> 00:27:52.450
She has a whole
other business she

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:56.980
started at prettysmallthings.com
selling dollhouse furniture.

00:27:56.980 --> 00:28:02.450
So whatever your passion
is, add a MakerBot

00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:05.110
it and a little
entrepreneurialism,

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:06.420
and game is on.

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:10.429
So cool.

00:28:10.429 --> 00:28:12.220
She shares these models
on Thingaverse too.

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:14.280
So if you have a MakerBot,
just download them,

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:18.655
and when you're shrunk
you'll have good furniture.

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:24.370
Bitonti did a project working
with students at Pratt.

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:30.750
He's a legit, totally
superstar fashion designer,

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:32.500
and he's making dresses.

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:35.980
We actually have one hanging
up at our store right

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:39.500
now on Mulberry Street,
just north of Houston.

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:44.600
Its hot.

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:47.760
Local Motors is
an awesome company

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:50.740
that makes desert
rally race cars.

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:57.720
And they realized that the
the mirrors were not far out

00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:00.060
enough on their rally fighter.

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:02.850
So on every really
fighter they actually

00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:06.990
print out little
extenders for the mirrors.

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:11.970
see a lot of MakerBots
in classrooms.

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:14.480
And this is Ryan Cain.

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.820
He actually has
students make houses,

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:21.540
prints them out, and he has
a whole large diorama set up

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:24.800
that everybody puts their
houses right next a river.

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:28.280
And then they take a hose and
run a hose through the river.

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:33.280
And the kids learn about erosion
by watching our house float

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:33.780
away.

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:40.120
We're on a mission , actually,
to put a MakerBot in every

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:43.230
school in the United
States of America.

00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:46.280
We started, and we're
actually working

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:51.226
on our second stage of
basically looking for funders.

00:29:51.226 --> 00:29:52.600
We basically give
an amazing deal

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:57.510
to funders who support a
teacher in getting MakerBot.

00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:59.876
We partnered with
donorschoose.org

00:29:59.876 --> 00:30:01.250
There's actually
stuff there now,

00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:02.874
if you want to go up
and see if there's

00:30:02.874 --> 00:30:05.360
a school in your neighborhood,
or your school you went to,

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.330
that wants a MakerBot.

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:10.610
And it's at the teacher's pull,
and then they get support.

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:13.430
And a lot of times
they don't even

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:17.700
need to wait for a
funder to fund it.

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:21.610
Communities are using it kind of
like a Kickstarter for teachers

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:23.570
to just get this
technology in classrooms.

00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:28.499
And I would equate it to
when I was a kid in 1981 ,

00:30:28.499 --> 00:30:30.790
there was an Apple II Plus
in my classroom that gave me

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:34.570
an unfair advantage over the
rest of the world as a nerd.

00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:39.020
And we're seeing the
next generation--

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:42.440
there's a different kind
of nerd that shows up.

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:45.880
In many ways, we've taken care
of most of the computer nerds

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.170
in the world.

00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:49.520
Young people access
like never before,

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:52.020
especially in this country.

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:54.946
there's the kids who like
to work with their hands.

00:30:54.946 --> 00:30:57.070
And I'm not sure if you
know, maybe you're like me.

00:30:57.070 --> 00:31:00.770
When I was a kid
I took auto shop.

00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:01.840
I took wood shop.

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:02.625
I took metal shop.

00:31:02.625 --> 00:31:03.750
And there was even home ec.

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:06.140
I liked home ec too.

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:08.310
That's all gone.

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:10.487
All those programs
have been decimated.

00:31:10.487 --> 00:31:12.570
one of the cool things is,
when you put a MakerBot

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:15.810
in a classroom it uses
all the technology that's

00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:17.630
available-- the computers
in the classroom.

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:20.520
And then allows young
people to actually do

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:26.430
things that are physical,
that are real in real life.

00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:30.850
And it just activates a
section of the population that

00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:34.770
isn't being served
by schools now.

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:36.910
It'll take us three
to five years to do,

00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:40.010
but I think it's actually
going to be one of the things

00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:45.780
that I think will basically
be our legacy if we do it, is

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:49.660
getting this equipment, getting
this technology in schools.

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:53.324
So if there's the right
person in the room,

00:31:53.324 --> 00:31:54.990
or you can point me
to the right person,

00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:59.700
I would love to connect and
amplify that with you all.

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:04.050
And so you can just go to
MakerBot.com/academy to learn

00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:06.030
more.

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:09.270
that's the end of my talk.

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:11.440
I've got a bunch of stuff
here that I can show you.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:14.400
And then I'd love
to take questions.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.980
I'm expecting good questions
from this audience.

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:19.810
So I've got a jet engine.

00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:23.427
This is one of the
designs that-- Chunky

00:32:23.427 --> 00:32:24.510
Trucks --that you can buy.

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:26.080
It's really awesome.

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:28.970
And it's all one print, and
it prints without supports.

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:35.340
Two-color, geometric thing.

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:37.695
This is a Voronoi Vase.

00:32:37.695 --> 00:32:40.590
You know what, actually?

00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:43.310
There may be some
community models here.

00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:50.010
I think this one might
be a community model.

00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:51.510
I'm going to have
to attribute this,

00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:53.060
and in the comments
of this video

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:54.810
I'll make sure everybody
gets attribution.

00:32:54.810 --> 00:32:56.310
That's important to me.

00:32:56.310 --> 00:33:00.230
A really nice bud vase, I
showed you the Robohand.

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.890
This is cool.

00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:04.810
This is printed in one print,
but it prints everything

00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:07.370
just with enough tolerances
away from each other

00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:11.050
that when you snap it off it
turns into like a necklace.

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:19.704
Easter was big on Thingaverse,
oh man-- that little bunny.

00:33:19.704 --> 00:33:21.120
You got one of
these little things

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:25.850
that's like a distraction tool.

00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:27.180
This is a big version of that.

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:30.070
It's the exact same
model, just scaled up.

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:34.590
For the MakerBot Academy stuff,
we're creating curriculum.

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:39.760
So we also created-- this is
the Great Pyramid of Giza,

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:41.960
but when you open it
up, you can actually

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:45.490
see there's a
little map in here,

00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:49.800
where you can see all
the secret chambers.

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:55.730
We also did a 3D-printed
dissectable frog.

00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:57.250
Saving frog's lives.

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:06.630
And a chip bag holder.

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:07.970
So let's see.

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:08.969
So I'll stop.

00:34:08.969 --> 00:34:11.010
I'll say thank you and
then we'll take questions.

00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:11.843
Thank you very much.

00:34:18.002 --> 00:34:18.800
You know what?

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.350
Before I do that
though, can I just

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:24.219
ask-- I was here exactly in
this spot five years ago.

00:34:24.219 --> 00:34:25.969
I know there's at least
two people in here

00:34:25.969 --> 00:34:28.427
--can you raise your hands if
you were here five years ago?

00:34:28.427 --> 00:34:30.792
One, two, three, four.

00:34:30.792 --> 00:34:31.462
Oh, that is--

00:34:31.462 --> 00:34:32.170
AUDIENCE: May 22.

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:33.170
BRE PETTIS: What's that?

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:33.800
AUDIENCE: It's May 22.

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.350
BRE PETTIS: That's when
I was here is May 22?

00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:36.199
AUDIENCE: 2009, yeah.

00:34:36.199 --> 00:34:36.750
BRE PETTIS: Oh, cool.

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:37.400
Thank you.

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:39.364
OK, first question.

00:34:39.364 --> 00:34:40.780
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for your talk.

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:42.084
I have a Replicator 2 at home.

00:34:42.084 --> 00:34:43.250
BRE PETTIS: Awesome machine.

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:43.719
Workhorse.

00:34:43.719 --> 00:34:44.302
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:44.302 --> 00:34:46.010
So two related questions.

00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:48.270
First is, your new print head.

00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:52.280
Do you-- the problem of
extrusion, sometimes.

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:55.150
And the problem is that
you have a long print,

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:56.620
and it stops in the middle.

00:34:56.620 --> 00:35:00.910
So your new print head, which
is a very low, low detail here,

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:03.880
it just makes sure that
if you run out of filament

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:04.550
it tells you.

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:06.258
But there are so many
other the problems.

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:11.940
I cannot tell-- I have a list of
things, and it stops printing.

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:13.120
And it runs.

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:15.270
It makes noises
and does nothing.

00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:17.325
Does your new print head
actually either stop

00:35:17.325 --> 00:35:21.030
or actually prevents a
problem from happening?

00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:23.800
BRE PETTIS: So one of the things
about-- so the Replicator 2

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:27.660
has a tool head that's
what's called "open loop."

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:30.250
So that means that it
doesn't have a sensor that

00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:35.180
knows-- if it runs out of
filament, it doesn't know.

00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:38.480
It just keeps going.

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:39.450
If it gets a jam.

00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:41.241
If there's a bunch of
dust on your filament

00:35:41.241 --> 00:35:45.230
that gets in there, clogs up
the nozzle, it doesn't know.

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:47.070
And it's come a
long way, actually,

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:49.020
from when we launched
that print head.

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:55.940
But the new smart extruder--
there's three sensors in there.

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:59.310
There's a hall effect sensor
to make leveling a lot easier,

00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:03.030
so it knows where the
extruder is in relationship,

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:07.860
so you can make the build
platform very flat, which

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:10.140
is another challenge
with the Replicator 2.

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:10.850
Very doable.

00:36:10.850 --> 00:36:13.522
It just takes a little bit
longer than you would like.

00:36:13.522 --> 00:36:14.980
And then we've got
sensors in there

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:17.990
that both sense whether
the filament is there

00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:19.590
and how fast it's
going in there.

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:23.160
So we're trying to
address all the things

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:27.220
that we wish we'd
done back in the day,

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:29.640
so there's a lot
we've addressed there.

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:31.400
Have we addressed everything?

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:33.080
I'd love to say yes,
but I think we're

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:35.538
going to find as we're shipping
these that there's probably

00:36:35.538 --> 00:36:38.897
something that we'll need
to do for the next one.

00:36:38.897 --> 00:36:40.480
The cool thing with
the smart extruder

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:44.040
though is it just pops off,
and it's held on by magnets.

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:48.815
So if and when we ever do do
an upgrade to the extruder,

00:36:48.815 --> 00:36:51.065
you can just by an extruder
rather than a whole new 3D

00:36:51.065 --> 00:36:51.779
printer.

00:36:51.779 --> 00:36:52.320
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:54.290
Follow-up question-- if
you have Replicator 2

00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:56.270
and you want to upgrade
to a new technology,

00:36:56.270 --> 00:37:00.150
the problem is you have to
buy new stuff from scratch.

00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:03.030
Do you have any
idea for trade-in?

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:05.795
BRE PETTIS: You know, I've
got an Android 2 phone

00:37:05.795 --> 00:37:09.722
that we can talk about.

00:37:09.722 --> 00:37:12.350
AUDIENCE: It's $2,000 thing.

00:37:12.350 --> 00:37:14.450
It's not just a smartphone.

00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:19.310
It's a $2,000 uhh-- for people--

00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:22.240
BRE PETTIS: I'm not sure if
you were here at the beginning.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:24.490
We've got Adam here.

00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:25.600
There he is in the back.

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:28.791
We do have a special thing for
people who are in this room.

00:37:28.791 --> 00:37:29.332
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:37:29.332 --> 00:37:29.832
Thank you.

00:37:29.832 --> 00:37:30.700
BRE PETTIS: OK?

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:33.720
Talk to Adam in the back there.

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:34.220
Great.

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:34.990
Next up.

00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:36.140
Over here.

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:37.950
AUDIENCE: Have you
done much thought

00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:42.050
about how this affects things
in the developing world context,

00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:44.580
because it is transformative,
but the biggest problem

00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:47.744
they have is often
just getting the PLA.

00:37:47.744 --> 00:37:49.160
BRE PETTIS: Yeah,
and then there's

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:52.300
also juice-- electricity.

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:57.390
So there's a group,
iLab, that is super-cool.

00:37:57.390 --> 00:38:00.567
They needed umbilical
cord clamps.

00:38:00.567 --> 00:38:01.400
They had a MakerBot.

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:02.570
They just make them.

00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:05.330
And it's actually
now the local supply

00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:08.690
for umbilical cord clamps.

00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:10.520
There's huge opportunity there.

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:12.410
And there's huge
opportunity for people

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:14.170
who are connected so
that they get there

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:17.530
and they can know
how to use it, have

00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:19.800
the resources, and
enough material.

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:22.670
The good thing is actually a
roll of MakerBot PLA filament

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:28.180
goes a long way--
390-some-odd chess pieces

00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:30.620
from one roll of filament.

00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:36.580
So in theory, someday you
might be able to make your own,

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:38.880
but right now the machine
that makes filament

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:43.020
is the size of a semi truck,
so probably not this year.

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:46.940
But there's all sorts of
room to innovate there.

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:49.760
AUDIENCE: Sort of to follow on--
you explored it a little bit,

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:52.850
is there any hope
of getting something

00:38:52.850 --> 00:38:56.090
to make filament
out of PET bottles?

00:38:56.090 --> 00:38:58.150
BRE PETTIS: Funny you ask that.

00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:00.820
One of the challenges--
so I had an idea

00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:05.580
we first started the
company to use an apple

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:09.920
corer to take to bottles
and just make strips

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.880
that then you could feed in.

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:14.480
The downside is
that would only work

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:16.589
on bottles that are more
than like 30 years old.

00:39:16.589 --> 00:39:18.630
Because since then they've
optimized the bottles,

00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:21.370
and all the bottles are
different thicknesses

00:39:21.370 --> 00:39:24.030
depending on how much
stress they're under.

00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:27.230
So there is a group,
though, that-- this

00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:29.930
is so cool --there's a group
at the University of Washington

00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:36.970
that entered this contest or
this-- th Milk Carton Derby

00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:38.760
on the Lake Washington.

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:43.950
And the idea is you have to
make a boat out of milk cartons

00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:46.270
and race it.

00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:49.250
And they're pretty loose on what
you do with the milk cartons

00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:51.030
and how you do that.

00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:52.780
So this group took a
bunch of milk cartons

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:56.120
which are made out of
HDPE-- thermoplastic

00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:59.660
--and they actually had a really
hard time keeping quality,

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:02.310
because every different
kind of milk carton

00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:04.520
doesn't necessarily have
the same quality plastic.

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:07.810
And anyway they put those
literally in a blender,

00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:12.070
and then made an extruder that
had a really thick nozzle,

00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:13.660
like 1/2 an inch.

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:15.340
And then they extruded a boat.

00:40:18.277 --> 00:40:20.610
And when they show up they
said, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:25.700
This is for boats made out of
milk cartons and milk jugs.

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:29.420
And they were like, uh huh.

00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:32.720
I think they probably
changed the rules next year.

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:34.997
But there's all sorts
of opportunities there.

00:40:34.997 --> 00:40:36.250
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:36.960
BRE PETTIS: Yeah.

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:38.959
AUDIENCE: So I've got a
whole list of questions,

00:40:38.959 --> 00:40:40.620
but I'll just ask one for now.

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:43.900
What are some of those short-
and long-term issues impeding

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:45.700
the progress of 3D
printing, and what

00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:49.704
are you or others in your
industry doing to solve them.

00:40:49.704 --> 00:40:50.370
BRE PETTIS: Hoo.

00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:53.911
One of the biggest ones
we have knocked down.

00:40:53.911 --> 00:40:54.410
We've done.

00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:57.040
So when I was here
five years ago,

00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:01.050
I had to explain what 3D
printing was as a concept,

00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:02.960
because nobody understood it.

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.690
And when I talked
about 3D printing,

00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:06.190
I might as well
been talking about

00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:11.220
like-- I don't know
--teleportation or something.

00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:14.591
Same thing, but yeah,
I feel like we've

00:41:14.591 --> 00:41:16.340
done a pretty good
job, because we took it

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:19.790
on as our primary mission first
and foremost to educate people

00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:23.620
about the possibilities
of the technology.

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:25.530
And I feel like we've
done that, actually.

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:29.130
I think once we got on the cover
of "Wired," we're like, OK.

00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:33.510
I think most people have
at least heard of it.

00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:37.719
Now I think our big challenge
is how do we get people

00:41:37.719 --> 00:41:39.510
to the point where they
think it's not just

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:40.940
for early adopters.

00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:43.344
That it's normal to
use a 3D printer.

00:41:43.344 --> 00:41:45.010
So I think that's our
biggest challenge,

00:41:45.010 --> 00:41:53.590
is how to educate the public
to just be like, yeah,

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:55.090
I just whipped it
up on my MakerBot.

00:41:55.090 --> 00:41:55.860
No big deal.

00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:57.300
I want that to be normal.

00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:02.410
Right now there's 44,000 or
more people with MakerBots.

00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:04.960
That's like they're already
living in that future.

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:07.920
And I think sometime this
year, we'll get to the point

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:10.910
where more than 50%
of the population

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:13.080
knows someone with a 3D printer.

00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:16.180
How many people here know
somebody with a 3D printer?

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:19.620
OK, for this room we may
have already gotten there.

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:22.146
But that's, I think,
the next big hurdle.

00:42:22.146 --> 00:42:23.770
And that's more of
a social engineering

00:42:23.770 --> 00:42:26.844
hurdle than a technical hurdle.

00:42:26.844 --> 00:42:29.010
AUDIENCE: Could you expand
on technological problems

00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:32.080
you might be facing, not just
cultural adaptation ones?

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:35.330
BRE PETTIS: I think the question
you're asking is sort of like,

00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:38.940
can you tell me all the secret
stuff you're working on?

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:40.572
And the weird thing
is, though, just--

00:42:40.572 --> 00:42:42.530
I hate to give you a
social engineering answer.

00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:45.670
The other thing, on
the technical side,

00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:47.360
it's actually making it easy.

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:49.790
I don't know how many of you
are early adopters, who've

00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:53.470
bought stuff on Kickstarter, and
you get it and it doesn't work.

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:57.100
But making things
to work easily--

00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:59.850
and this is where I lean on
my software department really

00:42:59.850 --> 00:43:04.100
heavy --is the hardest
thing so good UI, good UX.

00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:05.350
We take a lot of pride in it.

00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:06.683
We're working really hard on it.

00:43:06.683 --> 00:43:09.310
And that to us, we
believe, is the key

00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:13.572
to unlocking MakerBots
for everyone everywhere.

00:43:13.572 --> 00:43:14.280
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:14.988
BRE PETTIS: Sure.

00:43:17.429 --> 00:43:17.970
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:18.880
BRE PETTIS: Oh, I'm
going to come over here,

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:19.710
and I'll come back to you.

00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:20.710
We'll go back and forth.

00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:24.170
AUDIENCE: I'd read recently that
the core patents around laser

00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:26.110
centering have just expired.

00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:28.922
I wondered if you guys were
going to have any plans?

00:43:28.922 --> 00:43:30.130
BRE PETTIS: I heard that too.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.740
So laser centering,
just for everybody,

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:42.210
is where you take a bed
of powder and a big laser,

00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:46.470
and you laser the powder,
and it fuses one layer of it.

00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:48.769
And then you make a
very fine layer of power

00:43:48.769 --> 00:43:50.810
over on top of that layer,
and you fuse it again,

00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:52.940
and it fuses to the
layer underneath.

00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:57.650
And this is super cool.

00:43:57.650 --> 00:44:01.420
At MakerBot we're focused
on-- where did you go?

00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:02.520
Oh, there you are.

00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:05.830
At MakerBot we're
focused on-- I'm

00:44:05.830 --> 00:44:08.647
like what --we're
focused on making stuff

00:44:08.647 --> 00:44:10.230
that you can have
in your living room,

00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:13.490
on your desktop, that
can be truly universal.

00:44:13.490 --> 00:44:16.270
And with the laser
centering stuff,

00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:20.686
that powder's so fine that you
have to wear basically a gas

00:44:20.686 --> 00:44:21.810
mask when you're around it.

00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:25.870
I don't foresee a
family wearing gas masks

00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:28.520
to do something creative
going to happen anytime soon.

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:34.340
So for us it's not
really-- I can't

00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:36.460
say we'll never do it,
because I never say never,

00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:40.582
but it's not our
primary focus right now.

00:44:40.582 --> 00:44:41.249
Yeah.

00:44:41.249 --> 00:44:41.790
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:43.930
So, thank you for
coming, and my question

00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:48.050
is are you exploring any new,
different types of filaments?

00:44:53.410 --> 00:44:54.160
BRE PETTIS: Maybe.

00:44:57.672 --> 00:44:58.380
We have a couple.

00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:01.300
So we have a MakerBot
PLA, which is--

00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:03.760
PLA stands for polylactic acid.

00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:06.110
It's a renewable bioplastic
derived from corn,

00:45:06.110 --> 00:45:07.930
so it smells good
when you make things

00:45:07.930 --> 00:45:09.777
with it, which is--
you'd be surprised

00:45:09.777 --> 00:45:11.110
how important that is, actually.

00:45:11.110 --> 00:45:14.070
Like our the first
two 3D printers

00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:17.200
we had were primarily
for ABS, and even

00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:25.610
though we did the
tests, and it's not bad,

00:45:25.610 --> 00:45:33.150
it smells like hot plastic,
which is not awesome.

00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:37.282
Having PLA in your home is kind
of like you're making pancakes,

00:45:37.282 --> 00:45:38.240
is what it smells like.

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:42.320
And it turns out that does--
I think in some ways smell may

00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:46.600
be one of our most
important purchase factors.

00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:48.900
That being said, we've also
got-- so we've got ABS.

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:49.690
We've got PLA.

00:45:49.690 --> 00:45:54.330
We've got MakerBot flexible
filament, which is super cool.

00:45:54.330 --> 00:45:58.690
And then we've got a
dissolvable filament.

00:45:58.690 --> 00:46:04.960
It dissolves in limonene, which
is like a nontoxic cleaning

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:05.900
product.

00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:08.750
Smells like oranges.

00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:11.020
Again, smell.

00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:14.360
There is a whole frontier
of different materials.

00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:16.740
And we have some
limitations on how much heat

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:19.100
we can have into the
extruder, which limits it.

00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:22.742
And it's one of those things
where it's very frustrating.

00:46:22.742 --> 00:46:24.450
We've done a bunch of
research on a bunch

00:46:24.450 --> 00:46:25.408
of different materials.

00:46:25.408 --> 00:46:27.750
And we're like, OK
here's the new material.

00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:30.340
Is it better than PLA?

00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:31.750
No.

00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:34.060
And I don't know,
like, material science

00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:39.570
you're limited, frustratingly
enough, to the periodic table.

00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:43.920
And so when we
find better things,

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:45.300
we'll absolutely release them.

00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:53.550
And I wish I could
make that happen faster

00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:56.447
and add elements to
the periodic table.

00:46:56.447 --> 00:46:57.280
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:58.260
BRE PETTIS: Cheers.

00:46:58.260 --> 00:46:59.350
Back here

00:46:59.350 --> 00:47:00.270
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:02.840
So, HP announced
they would soon enter

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:04.160
the market of 3D printing.

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:06.430
So I was wondering, what are
your thoughts about these

00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:08.170
either traditional
printing company,

00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:12.280
or bigger consumer electronics
company coming into the market?

00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:15.000
And what's the
impact for MakerBot.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.820
BRE PETTIS: So we've been doing
3D printing for five years.

00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:22.160
And Stratasys is our
we-- that merged with,

00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:24.960
our sister company, has
been doing it for 25 years.

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:27.560
And Stratasys is sort of a
unified group of the smartest

00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:30.300
people in the world
pioneering 3D printing.

00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:34.406
And in many ways it was so
cool to get together with them,

00:47:34.406 --> 00:47:37.030
because all of our engineers got
together with their engineers.

00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:39.427
And we were like, we've
got these problems.

00:47:39.427 --> 00:47:41.010
We're wondering if
you have solutions,

00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:42.960
because you've been at for
like 20 more years than us.

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:45.126
And they were like, no those
are just hard problems.

00:47:45.126 --> 00:47:46.310
We've got them too.

00:47:46.310 --> 00:47:51.350
So I think that when you think
about competition in the world,

00:47:51.350 --> 00:47:54.840
people entering the
market, it's-- well, one,

00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:59.070
it's still so early,
so fricking game on.

00:47:59.070 --> 00:48:01.260
But I'm not really
worried about it.

00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:03.230
We're an innovation company.

00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:07.070
We're focused on empowering
people to innovate.

00:48:07.070 --> 00:48:08.089
Yes, over here.

00:48:08.089 --> 00:48:09.380
AUDIENCE: So I have two things.

00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:11.546
One is a follow up to the
filament question earlier,

00:48:11.546 --> 00:48:13.760
and there's a separate question.

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.363
Are you familiar with Filabot?

00:48:15.363 --> 00:48:16.130
BRE PETTIS: Yeah.

00:48:16.130 --> 00:48:19.590
AUDIENCE: OK, so your response
didn't seem to indicate that.

00:48:19.590 --> 00:48:23.710
Sub-$600 filament creation
from plastic shards and you can

00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:28.190
grind up previous prints from
your existing replicator.

00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:31.390
BRE PETTIS: So, I
don't really like

00:48:31.390 --> 00:48:34.590
to talk trash about anybody.

00:48:34.590 --> 00:48:36.126
And it's a really cool thing.

00:48:36.126 --> 00:48:37.500
And there needs
to be more of it.

00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:40.020
In fact, people need
to get these, find out

00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:42.620
that they need a lot of
work, and then do the work.

00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:46.220
And it's a cool project, and
people will absolutely do that.

00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:47.970
It's one of those
things though, that you

00:48:47.970 --> 00:48:50.570
should look into what
you spend on energy.

00:48:50.570 --> 00:48:51.944
You need to do it.

00:48:51.944 --> 00:48:53.735
You need to spend the
amount of electricity

00:48:53.735 --> 00:48:55.660
you pump in to make it happen.

00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:59.424
And the whole experience,
and how fast you can make it,

00:48:59.424 --> 00:49:01.715
and decide if that's where
you want to spend your time.

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:08.310
The other thing that we
obsess on pretty hardcore

00:49:08.310 --> 00:49:10.500
is ultra-high tolerances.

00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:13.420
And it's both
tolerances in terms

00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:14.721
of diameter and roundness.

00:49:14.721 --> 00:49:15.970
We have a roundness tolerance.

00:49:15.970 --> 00:49:18.410
And neither of those
things are trivial.

00:49:18.410 --> 00:49:23.700
And, again, our setup
for making filament

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:25.050
is the size of a semi truck.

00:49:25.050 --> 00:49:28.880
So we're not doing that just
because we like big things.

00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:31.160
It's because we're
really obsessed

00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:34.530
with making exceptionally high
quality filament that will just

00:49:34.530 --> 00:49:38.200
work and maintain
high tolerances.

00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:41.180
So exciting possibilities
are out there.

00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:42.320
I think it's exciting.

00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:45.801
I think that so many people
get excited about recycling

00:49:45.801 --> 00:49:46.300
filament.

00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:49.620
I think it's just
not a one liner.

00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:51.290
It's not a one line solution.

00:49:51.290 --> 00:49:53.270
AUDIENCE: All right,
separate question

00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:56.280
is, replicators
cost a lot of money.

00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:58.440
How much work are you
putting into trying

00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:00.349
to get affordable
printers out to people?

00:50:00.349 --> 00:50:02.890
You talk about trying to target
schools and things like that,

00:50:02.890 --> 00:50:05.360
but it's difficult to get
these into people's homes

00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:07.900
if people don't have
$2,000 to spend.

00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:09.920
BRE PETTIS: How much
was your laptop?

00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:12.187
AUDIENCE: My current laptop
or my previous previous?

00:50:12.187 --> 00:50:13.770
BRE PETTIS: Let's
say previous laptop.

00:50:13.770 --> 00:50:15.060
AUDIENCE: Around $500.

00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:15.685
BRE PETTIS: OK.

00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:23.650
Well, I guess you could get a
Chromebook for like $1 now too.

00:50:23.650 --> 00:50:26.840
So I'm not going
to win on that one.

00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:32.300
We took a product that was
$100,000 and we made it $2,000.

00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:35.910
So 50 times reduction in price.

00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:40.766
It turns out that to get lower
than that-- it's possible,

00:50:40.766 --> 00:50:42.890
but there's a few things
you have to do to do that.

00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:45.840
One, you can go the
Raspberry Pi way, which

00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:47.580
is the way most
Kickstarter products go,

00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:50.061
where they don't realize how
much build materials are.

00:50:50.061 --> 00:50:51.560
And Raspberry Pi
is a great computer

00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:53.690
you can buy that costs $35.

00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:55.260
And it's at cost.

00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:57.630
And the company that
makes the chip on it

00:50:57.630 --> 00:51:00.330
wants you to use Raspberry
Pis, because then you're

00:51:00.330 --> 00:51:03.971
going to prototype another
Raspberry Pi and by that chip.

00:51:03.971 --> 00:51:05.470
And Raspberry Pis
are super-awesome.

00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:08.920
They're empowering people to do
wonderfully stupid things that

00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:12.130
are super innovative, that
move the world forward.

00:51:12.130 --> 00:51:15.250
But they have a
motivation to do that.

00:51:15.250 --> 00:51:19.290
So if you don't mind
not making any money

00:51:19.290 --> 00:51:21.060
or building a
sustainable business,

00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:25.090
you can build a RepRap,
which is actually,

00:51:25.090 --> 00:51:27.430
if you want to get into
low cost 3D printing,

00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:29.650
and you don't mind spending
a couple hundred hours--

00:51:29.650 --> 00:51:30.360
AUDIENCE: I have a Prusa.

00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:32.480
It's kind of broken at the
moment, but I have one.

00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:35.510
BRE PETTIS: Right,
see-- that's the trick.

00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:37.240
And Prusa actually,
to its credit,

00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:40.180
built a platform where
you can make your own 3D

00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:44.950
printer-- a lot of them
were made on a MakerBot,

00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:48.575
but you pay a price in
fussiness basically,

00:51:48.575 --> 00:51:51.350
and there's no support to call.

00:51:51.350 --> 00:51:53.940
So it depends on where
the value is for you.

00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:57.170
I mean at some point
we may get to a point

00:51:57.170 --> 00:52:00.180
where the hardware
is a commodity.

00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:02.360
To make that work,
as a business,

00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:04.600
we have to figure out
other ways to make money

00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:06.250
to make that work.

00:52:06.250 --> 00:52:09.994
So I can keep hiring people.

00:52:09.994 --> 00:52:11.660
So is that a good
enough answer for you?

00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:12.800
Does that make sense?

00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:14.030
AUDIENCE: Good enough.

00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:18.550
BRE PETTIS: I would love to have
a more affordable 3D-- I mean,

00:52:18.550 --> 00:52:20.160
I believe we are
affordable compared

00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:22.060
to the way it used to be.

00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:24.450
And I know we have to keep
making it more affordable.

00:52:24.450 --> 00:52:24.950
Yeah.

00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:25.890
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:52:25.890 --> 00:52:28.050
BRE PETTIS: Cheers.

00:52:28.050 --> 00:52:31.600
AUDIENCE: Hey, two questions.

00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:34.170
First, cool talk.

00:52:34.170 --> 00:52:38.550
Second, I have like a
300 square foot studio.

00:52:38.550 --> 00:52:41.894
I don't have any room to put one
of these even if I wanted one--

00:52:41.894 --> 00:52:43.060
AUDIENCE: Move to Brookylyn.

00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:48.470
AUDIENCE: --and I kind of do.

00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:51.600
Is there any idea
around 3D print shops,

00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:53.370
like we have 2D print shops.

00:52:53.370 --> 00:53:00.410
BRE PETTIS: So if you come in
with a USB stick or whatever

00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:03.140
to our Mulberry store, we'll
just make something for you.

00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:06.020
I mean, we'll charge
you for it, but it's

00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:08.135
cheaper than a
MakerBot Replicator.

00:53:08.135 --> 00:53:09.010
AUDIENCE: That works.

00:53:09.010 --> 00:53:11.210
BRE PETTIS: So
that's accessible.

00:53:11.210 --> 00:53:12.785
You could also go
to the workshop.

00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:17.860
AUDIENCE: And the other thing.

00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:20.020
Is there any-- I don't
have a good intuition

00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:22.900
for how strong these are.

00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:24.040
How do you learn that?

00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:25.920
Just making stuff that breaks?

00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:28.200
BRE PETTIS: Yeah, break it.

00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:31.940
You'll have to get a MakerBot
and build another one.

00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:36.670
But really, I mean, it's
surprisingly strong.

00:53:36.670 --> 00:53:37.940
We built a chain.

00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:39.949
And we hung from it
and tried to break it,

00:53:39.949 --> 00:53:40.990
and we couldn't break it.

00:53:45.010 --> 00:53:47.390
It has some torsion challenge.

00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:49.560
If you torsion it, like if
you were to take a chain,

00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:51.350
and you were to
go like this, you

00:53:51.350 --> 00:53:55.210
would use less energy than if
you pulled on it to break it.

00:53:55.210 --> 00:53:59.630
And the good thing is basically
all the industrial designers

00:53:59.630 --> 00:54:01.790
are like, oh I'm not sure
if that's strong enough.

00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:03.706
And then they test it,
and it's strong enough.

00:54:03.706 --> 00:54:06.807
So I can say basically
it's strong enough.

00:54:06.807 --> 00:54:08.890
But if you actually want
to know how strong it is,

00:54:08.890 --> 00:54:11.770
yeah you'll have to break it.

00:54:11.770 --> 00:54:12.890
And go for it, please.

00:54:12.890 --> 00:54:15.480
I encourage-- that's how
we all have to learn.

00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:17.231
I mean, I don't
have more for you.

00:54:17.231 --> 00:54:18.980
So you can't break it
and get another one,

00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:21.460
but please, yeah, explore it.

00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:21.970
Try it out.

00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:26.750
Over here.

00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:28.461
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:54:28.461 --> 00:54:34.590
I actually have a Cupcake 3D
printer, and I really liked it.

00:54:34.590 --> 00:54:36.210
Now the thing
you're talking about

00:54:36.210 --> 00:54:43.680
with having the social
or consumer level

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:46.810
in the home, where it's just
something that you would have.

00:54:46.810 --> 00:54:52.370
I still haven't seen the--
what I could potential

00:54:52.370 --> 00:54:55.860
make in the future
that would justify

00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:58.470
the cost of even a $500 thing.

00:54:58.470 --> 00:55:00.410
I've made little
things, like I've

00:55:00.410 --> 00:55:02.830
made a holder for
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:02.830 --> 00:55:06.240
for my mom or something,
or something like a hook

00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:09.180
to hold headphones, and
other things like that.

00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:10.810
And they're really cool.

00:55:10.810 --> 00:55:14.620
And I can justify that as I
bought the printer as a toy

00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:16.910
to play with, but
I couldn't really

00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:20.520
justify it as I
bought it to make

00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:22.920
this little holder
for the [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:24.960
I bought it to make
holders for my headphones,

00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:26.190
or something like that.

00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:30.350
Where do we have to go to get it
so that you we can make things

00:55:30.350 --> 00:55:32.566
like that people
will be like, OK?

00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:38.760
BRE PETTIS: That's my
challenge, right there.

00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:41.440
So first of all, thank you
for being one of-- there's

00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:43.190
not many Cupcake
owners in the world.

00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:45.810
So thanks to Google, and
thanks to you for personally

00:55:45.810 --> 00:55:50.180
supporting us when we were
making our early 3D printers.

00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:51.570
They were so fussy.

00:55:51.570 --> 00:55:54.850
I'm so glad we're past that.

00:55:54.850 --> 00:56:01.150
And Yeah so there's all sorts
of-- so thank you for that.

00:56:01.150 --> 00:56:05.480
I think I'll throw the
question back at you.

00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:08.100
I would say that while
I'm sure that-- there

00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:10.105
are a lot of things
you can make.

00:56:10.105 --> 00:56:12.230
We literally have high
schoolers who get MakerBots,

00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:14.960
to go into business and make
back the cost of the MakerBot

00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:17.460
replicator in like
a month and a half.

00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:22.500
Protip-- make phone cases
with your school's logo on it.

00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:24.420
Game on.

00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:25.810
So there's stuff like that.

00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:32.110
But I would say
maybe you just need

00:56:32.110 --> 00:56:34.790
to develop a product
that everybody wants.

00:56:34.790 --> 00:56:38.240
And then you go into
small-scale manufacturing,

00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:47.250
and then use that as a
jumping board for going big.

00:56:50.445 --> 00:56:51.320
Do you have kids yet?

00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:53.410
AUDIENCE: I do not.

00:56:53.410 --> 00:56:56.860
BRE PETTIS: So I have a daughter
is 2 1/2, and I come home,

00:56:56.860 --> 00:56:59.480
and she basically says what
did you make me on the MakerBot

00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:01.200
today?

00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:04.180
I'm screwed.

00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:06.505
Eventually I'll be
like, do your homework.

00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:14.060
But I get to basically
be a superhero

00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:15.600
around the house
with the MakerBot,

00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:18.010
and that justifies
it pretty well--

00:57:18.010 --> 00:57:22.840
basically being able to make
stuff like coathooks, fixing

00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:26.970
the drain when it breaks,
and all that kind of stuff.

00:57:26.970 --> 00:57:28.870
But, honestly, the
stuff I love to make

00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:31.030
is all the weird,
artistic stuff.

00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:37.020
I just printed out a model of
the Antikythera device made

00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:39.130
by Cosmo Wenman,
designed by Cosmo Wenman.

00:57:39.130 --> 00:57:41.650
And it's not a working
Antikythera device

00:57:41.650 --> 00:57:45.290
for the other ancient
computing nerds in the room.

00:57:45.290 --> 00:57:49.490
It's a model of what they
pull out of the ocean.

00:57:49.490 --> 00:57:52.310
Antikythera device is
something that they pulled out

00:57:52.310 --> 00:57:57.960
of the ocean about 2,000 years
ago that is a working computer.

00:57:57.960 --> 00:58:01.652
I think it's just 70
different gears in it,

00:58:01.652 --> 00:58:03.610
except for the fact that
gears weren't invented

00:58:03.610 --> 00:58:06.120
for another 1,500
years, or used.

00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:08.600
So either there's
a time traveler,

00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:11.500
or somebody was really smart.

00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:12.330
Super-cool.

00:58:12.330 --> 00:58:16.201
Anyway, get ye to Wikipedia.

00:58:16.201 --> 00:58:18.450
So it kind of depends on
what you're passionate about.

00:58:18.450 --> 00:58:22.164
I think when people really
get crazy with their MakerBot,

00:58:22.164 --> 00:58:23.580
it's when they
find their passion.

00:58:23.580 --> 00:58:26.080
Whether it's a dollhouse
furniture, like I showed,

00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:31.500
or starting a business,
or getting into something.

00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:34.560
The quadcopter fanatics on
Thingaverse are out of control.

00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:38.780
There's close to 1,000 mounts
you can connect to a GoPro

00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:41.100
that you can print
out on your MakerBot.

00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:44.610
So I would ask what's
your obsession,

00:58:44.610 --> 00:58:48.120
and then go from there.

00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:50.104
AUDIENCE: I've been
doing robotics, right.

00:58:50.104 --> 00:58:52.030
BRE PETTIS: OK, great.

00:58:52.030 --> 00:58:53.780
AUDIENCE: What it seems
like you're really

00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:57.204
saying is the 3D printer would
be less like the 2D printer,

00:58:57.204 --> 00:58:58.745
where it's something
that you'd have.

00:58:58.745 --> 00:59:02.607
And it have the
same function of,

00:59:02.607 --> 00:59:04.690
I need to print out the
documents so I can hand it

00:59:04.690 --> 00:59:06.690
in at school, or whatever.

00:59:06.690 --> 00:59:10.710
This is more as
something to inspire

00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:14.940
you to do something
new and different

00:59:14.940 --> 00:59:16.810
that you couldn't
have done before.

00:59:16.810 --> 00:59:19.690
BRE PETTIS: You're hired.

00:59:19.690 --> 00:59:20.554
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:59:20.554 --> 00:59:21.470
BRE PETTIS: Thank you.

00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:23.420
Good.

00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:25.870
MALE SPEAKER: So let's make
this the last question, sorry.

00:59:25.870 --> 00:59:26.706
BRE PETTIS: Sure.

00:59:26.706 --> 00:59:28.080
AUDIENCE: So 3D
printing is cool,

00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:30.330
because you can print whatever
you want within reason.

00:59:30.330 --> 00:59:33.050
But two groups that might
oppose certain uses for it

00:59:33.050 --> 00:59:35.139
are copyright holders,
like maybe Disney

00:59:35.139 --> 00:59:37.430
doesn't want you to print
out a bunch of Mickey Mouses,

00:59:37.430 --> 00:59:38.620
even though you could.

00:59:38.620 --> 00:59:40.560
Or governments you
don't want people

00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:42.940
to print out weaponry or guns.

00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:49.904
So do you see them as
having a legitimate claim

00:59:49.904 --> 00:59:51.320
to preventing
people from printing

00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:52.736
whatever they want
on 3D printers,

00:59:52.736 --> 00:59:55.427
or what's your take on
those sorts of impediments?

00:59:55.427 --> 00:59:57.260
BRE PETTIS: I'll ask
you a couple questions,

00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:58.720
and then I'll tell
you my answer.

00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:03.300
First question, did you ever
have a cassette tape recorder?

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:04.490
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:00:04.490 --> 01:00:08.270
BRE PETTIS: OK, did you
ever have a VHS machine.

01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:09.420
Right OK, maybe not?

01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:10.447
A VHS machine.

01:00:10.447 --> 01:00:11.030
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:14.810
BRE PETTIS: OK, phew.

01:00:14.810 --> 01:00:16.310
And then did you
ever have a CD-R?

01:00:16.310 --> 01:00:17.810
AUDIENCE: Of course.

01:00:17.810 --> 01:00:21.967
BRE PETTIS: Have you ever
watched anything on YouTube.?

01:00:21.967 --> 01:00:22.550
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:00:22.550 --> 01:00:23.830
BRE PETTIS: Bam!

01:00:23.830 --> 01:00:28.890
So just like YouTube, frankly,
we're absurdly DMCA compliant.

01:00:28.890 --> 01:00:31.420
So it's not going to be
that different from issues

01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:32.230
YouTube has.

01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:34.580
And in fact we get them.

01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:37.050
We have one company
that makes little tanks

01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:42.030
that tabletop gamers-- it
costs less than $1 in filament

01:00:42.030 --> 01:00:47.500
to make them on your MakerBot,
but when people post them

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:50.380
on Thingaverse and they
use the brand name,

01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:54.250
the brand sends us a DMCA
takedown, and we're complaint.

01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:55.170
We comply.

01:00:55.170 --> 01:00:56.710
And it'll be interesting.

01:00:56.710 --> 01:00:58.740
So far on YouTube,
actually, you've

01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:01.170
had a pretty interesting
ride with this.

01:01:01.170 --> 01:01:04.270
I think, in fact, you're sort
of the test case for this

01:01:04.270 --> 01:01:06.534
here, in that, there's
a whole procedure--

01:01:06.534 --> 01:01:08.450
and I'm not a lawyer
--but there's a procedure

01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:11.060
that once something comes
down, the person can say,

01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:14.530
no, I really did make
that remake of "Sleepless

01:01:14.530 --> 01:01:15.060
in Seattle."

01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:17.010
And it looks exactly
like the original movie.

01:01:17.010 --> 01:01:18.030
Put it back up.

01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:23.620
And the only way it comes down
after that is from the courts.

01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:25.330
Nobody's taken it
that far with things,

01:01:25.330 --> 01:01:27.480
but it'll be an adventure.

01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:33.020
And we're going to-- just like
we survived cassette tapes, VHS

01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:36.000
machines, CD-R
drives --we're going

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.667
to explore it an make it work.

01:01:37.667 --> 01:01:39.750
AUDIENCE: I want to hear
more about the guns part.

01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:40.640
That was interesting.

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:41.681
AUDIENCE: Yeah, the guns.

01:01:41.681 --> 01:01:49.850
BRE PETTIS: Oh, so the question
is what about 3D printed guns,

01:01:49.850 --> 01:01:50.980
and I get this a lot.

01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:53.860
And my standard answer
is basically like,

01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:55.400
there's way more
interesting things

01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:58.300
that you can make on
a MakerBot than a gun,

01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:01.310
and way more easier ways
to acquire a firearm,

01:02:01.310 --> 01:02:03.820
especially in this country.

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:10.420
You also have to
think, like-- yeah,

01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:12.400
I think I would
just leave it there.

01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:17.210
Yeah.

01:02:17.210 --> 01:02:21.240
I think that's all to
really say about that,

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:23.670
because sure it's
super-exciting.

01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:29.510
And there was a moment where
like every channel was like,

01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:33.670
did you know that you might
have a 3D printer in your house,

01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:36.410
and it could do
something very scary.

01:02:36.410 --> 01:02:38.732
News at 11.

01:02:38.732 --> 01:02:40.190
We had that kind
of hype around it,

01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:44.750
which did a lot to promote
3D printing, frankly.

01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:47.540
But it's just not our spirit.

01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:50.745
At MakerBot we're obsessed with
unlocking people's creativity.

01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:56.642
So I just-- it'll
be an adventure.

01:02:56.642 --> 01:02:57.350
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

01:02:57.350 --> 01:02:58.010
BRE PETTIS: Cheers.

01:02:58.010 --> 01:02:59.190
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks
everyone for coming.

01:02:59.190 --> 01:02:59.690
Thank you.

01:02:59.690 --> 01:03:02.930
Let's give a warm
round of applause.
