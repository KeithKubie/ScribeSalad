00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.620
I've been requested to do some
more implicit differentiation

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.630
or differentiation of implicit
functions by I believe his name

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.170
is [? Akash ?], so I
will do some more.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.280
And these are actually the
problems that he sent to me and

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.840
they looked good, so those
are the ones I'll do.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:23.170
The first problem he gave me,
and I'll do it in green, says y

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:36.500
to the third power minus xy
squared plus cosine

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.060
xy is equal to 2.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.180
So like all differentiation of
implicit functions-- and of

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.660
course in these examples I'm
going to-- except for the last

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.730
one-- I'm going to find
the derivative of y

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:49.860
with respect to x.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.540
So in all of these I
want to figure out what

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.890
dy/dx is equal to.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.130
Well to do that just like in
the previous video we just take

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.780
the derivative with respect to
x on both sides of

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:02.480
this equation.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.370
So we do the derivative
operator I guess

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:05.910
we could call it.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.930
So we're going to take
it on this side.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.235
ddx.

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:12.250
And we're going to take the
derivative of everything.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.990
Then we're going to take the
derivative on the right hand

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.090
side, the derivative of 2,
which we know hopefully

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.790
by this point is 0.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.780
And I'll do it a little bit
quicker than in last video, but

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.140
anyway send me a note if you
think I did it too fast.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.240
So let's take the derivative
of each of these terms.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.360
So the derivative with
respect to x of y cubed.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.640
Well it's the derivative with
respect to y, we're just

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.470
doing the chain rule.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:45.140
So it's 3y-- that's a y,
not a g-- 3y squared.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.990
So the derivative of this
function with respect to y

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.120
times the derivative of
y with respect to x.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.950
dy/dx.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.820
That's just the chain rule.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.740
And then we have minus
the derivative of this

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.840
with respect to x.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.920
Well this is a little
interesting, because here we

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.810
have x times y squared, which
we're arguing is maybe a

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.000
function of what's an
implicit function of x.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.530
So how do we do that?

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.440
What we'll do-- let me put the
subtraction sign outside and

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.330
then let's do the derivative
inside, and I'll do it

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.620
inside some brackets.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.280
So let's do the
product rule here.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.510
We have x times y squared.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.870
The product rule says it's the
derivative of the first

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.780
function times a second
function plus the derivative of

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.780
the second function times
the first function.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.640
So the derivative of the first
function with respect to x--

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.050
remember what we're taking the
derivative with respect to--

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.070
well the derivative
of x is just 1.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:46.520
1 times y squared plus
the derivative of

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.420
the second function.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.282
Well what's the derivative
of the second function?

00:02:49.282 --> 00:02:54.200
Well it's going to be 2y
dy/dx, and that just comes

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.305
from the chain rule.

00:02:56.305 --> 00:02:59.690
The derivative with respect
to y times the derivative

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:00.940
of y with respect to x.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.200
That's the chain rule.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.440
So that's the derivative of y
squared, and then we multiply

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.200
that times the first
function, which is x.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.700
Times x.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.170
Hopefully that
didn't confuse you.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.310
Just took the derivative
of x times y squared.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.650
This is the product rule.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.830
Plus the derivative
of y squared, which

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.930
was this times x.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.340
OK now we're ready to move on.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.010
OK.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.610
Now this is interesting.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.900
This is interesting.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.160
We have to take the
derivative of cosine of xy.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.840
Well once again we just
do the chain rule.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.740
And maybe I'll actually break
it up into a couple of steps

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.910
here just so that you don't
get completely confused.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.850
So what does the chain rule say
if we have you know f of g

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.330
of x of whatever whatever?

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.460
We essentially have to take the
derivative of the inside

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.430
function and multiply-- or well
I guess you could

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.130
do it two ways.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.040
You could say we take the
entire derivative with respect

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.660
to whatever this function is.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.770
You know if g was equal to xy
we could say the derivative of

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.000
cosine of g with respect to g.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.460
And then we would multiply
that times the derivative

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.280
of this with respect to x.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.690
If that confuses you, I think
it'll make more sense when

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:13.680
I actually do the example.

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:18.520
Actually let me write out like
just the way I said it, because

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.650
I think that could maybe even
clear up some confusion

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:22.360
over the chain rule.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.760
Or maybe it'll
confuse you further.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.580
So what are we doing?

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.500
We're going to do the
derivative-- let me do this

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.620
in a different color.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.020
So let's take derivative
of the outside function

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.040
with respect to xy.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.680
So what is that?

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.210
What's the derivative
of cosine of x?

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.400
Or let's say if it was
g is equal to xy.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.300
If g is equal to xy, then
that expression there

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.400
is cosine of g.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.900
So what's the derivative of
this with respect to g?

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.060
Sorry, dg.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.040
Well that's just minus
sin of g, right?

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.630
So let me do that in
a different color.

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:11.690
So it's minus sin,
and g was just xy.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.755
So that's the derivative
of you can kind of say

00:05:16.755 --> 00:05:18.350
of the outside function.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.170
And then we go to the inside,
and we have to multiply this

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:23.270
times the derivative of
this inside function.

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.640
Let me just write
that like this.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.790
Times the derivative with
respect to x--that's what

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.710
we're doing-- of xy.

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.160
And I'm going to leave it
like that for now because

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.050
that's going to take a
little bit of space.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.430
And then that equals
the derivative of 2

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:39.340
with respect to x.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.850
Well 2 never changes, right?

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.780
It's a constant, so
it's derivative is 0.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.730
Let's see if we can simplify
this a little bit, and

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.010
we'll come back to that,
let's just write this.

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:56.695
So we have 3g-- no I'm
confusing myself with

00:05:56.695 --> 00:05:58.760
my bad penmanship.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:05.670
3y-- all that talk of g
got me confused-- dy/dx.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:13.360
3y squared dy/dx minus y
squared minus-- I'm just

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:27.460
distributing the minus--
xy minus 2xy dy/dx

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.010
minus sin of xy.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.740
And then this whole thing
times the derivative of

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.705
xy with respect to x.

00:06:40.705 --> 00:06:42.910
Well we can just do the
product rule here.

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.210
What's the derivative of
xy with respect to x?

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:50.750
Well the derivative of x
is 1, so it's 1 times y.

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.920
Derivative of the first
times the second function.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.870
Plus the derivative of
the second function

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:57.810
with respect to x.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.860
So what's the derivative
of y with respect to x?

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.370
Well it's just dy/dx, right?

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.630
dy/dx times the first function.

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:06.600
That's just the product rule.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.350
Review of the product rule if
that was a little confusing.

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:11.650
It's equal to 0.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:16.020
And now we can
attempt to simplify.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.170
So let's see if I can do it.

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:30.400
So we have 3y squared
dy/dx minus y squared

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.540
minus 2xy dy/dx.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.060
Now this one's interesting,
so let me distribute

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.200
the sin of xy.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:08:01.470
This is just a 1, so it's minus
y sin of xy minus x dy/dx sin

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:04.355
of xy-- I'm just simplifying,
this is just algebra.

00:08:04.355 --> 00:08:07.000
So y is equal to 0.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.040
Now let's group all of the
terms that have a dy/dx in them

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.570
and distribute out the dy/dx.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:24.520
So this is equal to dy/dx times
this 3y squared minus two xy.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:28.580
I'm just undistributing where
I'm dividing out the dy/dx.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.480
So let me actually
show you the terms.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.590
So this has a dy/dx,
this has a dy/dx.

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:34.805
And this is just algebra.

00:08:34.805 --> 00:08:38.500
This has a dy/dx, so let
me separate those out.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:53.870
So it's 3y squared minus
2xy minus x sin of xy.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:01.580
Well that's all of the ones
with the dy/dx on them.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.340
And then these terms-- and I'm
just skipping a couple of

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:07.030
steps because this is
algebra right now.

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:11.190
The non dy/dx terms-- that
term, and I guess there's only

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:13.600
two of them-- I'm just going
to add to the other

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.120
side of equation.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.420
So I'm just going to bring
them over to the other side.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.900
Hopefully that step
doesn't confuse you.

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:23.020
This is just algebraic
simplification at this point.

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:26.010
I could have written minus y
squared minus y sin xy and then

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:28.250
added them on the other side,
but I'm about to run out of

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:32.660
space and time, so I'm just
going to add these to both

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:33.660
sides of the equation.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:45.170
So that equals y squared
plus y sin of xy.

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:47.310
I think I've covered
all of the terms.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:50.720
And now since our goal is to
find the derivative of y with

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.350
respect to x, we can divide
both sides of this equation by

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:58.390
this term right here, and our
final answer is-- let me

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:00.580
do it in a good color.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.760
dy/dx.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.360
The derivative of y with
respect to x is equal to that

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:19.230
y squared plus y sin of xy
divided by this-- 3y squared

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:26.700
minus 2xy minus x sin of xy.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.170
And there you have it.

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:32.650
That was a good implicit
differentiation problem and if

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:35.310
you understood how to do that,
you understand how to do

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:37.040
implicit differentiation.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.280
And I hope I didn't make any
careless mistakes, and it's a

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.010
good exercise for you to try
to do it again on your own.

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:42.390
See you soon.
