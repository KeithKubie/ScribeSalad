00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.550
The typical hedge fund develops
methods to find stocks they think

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.340
will perform well.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.020
The informational edge that they're
seeking is usually market relative,

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.520
meaning they're looking for stocks
that will go up more than the market.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.060
If the market goes up,

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.430
your stocks will go down less than
the market if the market goes down.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.980
If this information
they have is reliable

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.560
they can take advantage of the cap m
to virtually guarantee positive return.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.930
In this lesson I'll show
you how all of that works.
