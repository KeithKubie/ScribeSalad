00:00:00.191 --> 00:00:05.117
Now, let's look at some examples of
how these metrics, session count,

00:00:05.117 --> 00:00:10.133
session length, and retention can
really affect monetization in games.

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:15.042
First, let's consider a straightforward
example of a game that uses ads to make

00:00:15.042 --> 00:00:15.553
money.

00:00:15.553 --> 00:00:19.832
Now ads might not make the most money,
which we'll get into later, but

00:00:19.832 --> 00:00:24.194
their success does depend on how often
and how long users play your game.

00:00:24.194 --> 00:00:26.800
Because each time an ad
is displayed in the game,

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.545
it makes a small amount of money for
the developer.

00:00:29.545 --> 00:00:33.417
And when there are a lot of sessions,
so the session count is high,

00:00:33.417 --> 00:00:36.544
there will be a lot of
opportunities to display an ad.

00:00:36.544 --> 00:00:38.985
Similarly, when a session is long,

00:00:38.985 --> 00:00:42.625
ads might be displayed
multiple times in one session.

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:46.505
So both of these result in
more ads being displayed.

00:00:46.505 --> 00:00:48.793
And more ads mean more money, and

00:00:48.793 --> 00:00:53.135
retention looks at these effects
over a longer period of time.

00:00:53.135 --> 00:00:56.035
Say, your app launches, and
people are excited about it.

00:00:56.035 --> 00:00:59.923
There's a lot of sessions, but then
after a week or so, people start to get

00:00:59.923 --> 00:01:03.655
bored with it, and the number of
players and sessions drops over time.

00:01:03.655 --> 00:01:08.345
And when the number of sessions drop, so
does the amount of money the game makes.

00:01:08.345 --> 00:01:12.569
So high retention is important for
monetization because your game will only

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:16.005
make money over time if you retain
a steady number of players.

00:01:16.005 --> 00:01:20.549
Retention is especially important if
your game is planning on selling items

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.904
in the game over time.

00:01:21.904 --> 00:01:26.314
These items are called in-app purchases
and include things like power-ups or

00:01:26.314 --> 00:01:30.143
special game equipment that players
can buy and then use in the game.

00:01:30.143 --> 00:01:32.944
And you want these sales to be
pretty consistent over time so

00:01:32.944 --> 00:01:34.520
that you continue to make money.
