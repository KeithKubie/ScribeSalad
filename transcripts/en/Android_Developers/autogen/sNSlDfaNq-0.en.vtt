and we're gonna be talking about some

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000
and we're gonna be talking about some
 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.060
and we're gonna be talking about some
ways to think about themes and styles at

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070
ways to think about themes and styles at
 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.279
ways to think about themes and styles at
a high level and how to apply those when

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289
a high level and how to apply those when
 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.779
a high level and how to apply those when
you're designing themes and styles for

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789
you're designing themes and styles for
 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.420
you're designing themes and styles for
your application so first let's start at

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430
your application so first let's start at
 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.640
your application so first let's start at
a high level the way that designers

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650
a high level the way that designers
 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.589
a high level the way that designers
create mocks and the way that developers

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599
create mocks and the way that developers
 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.720
create mocks and the way that developers
are interpreting them so here's the

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730
are interpreting them so here's the
 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.430
are interpreting them so here's the
latest iteration of the material design

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440
latest iteration of the material design
 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.500
latest iteration of the material design
theme palettes so if you're not using

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510
theme palettes so if you're not using
 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.330
theme palettes so if you're not using

yet you may recognize primary as the
 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.220
yet you may recognize primary as the

mapping of well this is gonna be my
primary dark color in my theme this is

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469
primary dark color in my theme this is
 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.459
primary dark color in my theme this is
going to be the primary color and

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469
going to be the primary color and
 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.020
going to be the primary color and
embedding those directly in your theme

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030
embedding those directly in your theme
 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.460
embedding those directly in your theme
but it's important to make sure that

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470
but it's important to make sure that
 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.109
but it's important to make sure that
your designer understands that there are

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119
your designer understands that there are
 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.700
your designer understands that there are
these canonical attributes so if you're

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710
these canonical attributes so if you're
 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.560
these canonical attributes so if you're
getting a mock that just has a hex color

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570
getting a mock that just has a hex color
 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.750
getting a mock that just has a hex color
specified it can be helpful to maybe

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760
specified it can be helpful to maybe
 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.999

push back a little bit and say let's

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009
push back a little bit and say let's
 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.399
push back a little bit and say let's
call this the primary variance or let's

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409
call this the primary variance or let's
 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.130
call this the primary variance or let's
call this the primary color and it's

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140
call this the primary color and it's
 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.060
call this the primary color and it's
great that we have all of these

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070
great that we have all of these
 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.999
great that we have all of these
predefined theme colors with meaningful

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009
predefined theme colors with meaningful
 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.490
predefined theme colors with meaningful
names and meaningful contrast ratios

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500
names and meaningful contrast ratios
 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.319
names and meaningful contrast ratios
that have to exist between foreground

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329
that have to exist between foreground
 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.420
that have to exist between foreground
and background and additional colors in

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430
and background and additional colors in
 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.390
and background and additional colors in
the material palette occasionally you

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400
the material palette occasionally you
 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.950
the material palette occasionally you
will get a brand new color that doesn't

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960
will get a brand new color that doesn't
 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.740
will get a brand new color that doesn't
exist anywhere and finding a name for

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750
exist anywhere and finding a name for
 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.410
exist anywhere and finding a name for
this may be difficult so here we have a

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420
this may be difficult so here we have a
 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.450
this may be difficult so here we have a
purple color that's a little bit lighter

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460
purple color that's a little bit lighter
 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.179
purple color that's a little bit lighter
than our primary variants and it has

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189
than our primary variants and it has
 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.219
than our primary variants and it has
contrast against white so we're going to

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229
contrast against white so we're going to
 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.219
contrast against white so we're going to
be displaying white text on top of it if

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229
be displaying white text on top of it if
 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.630
be displaying white text on top of it if
we want to come up with a name for this

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640
we want to come up with a name for this
 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.740
we want to come up with a name for this
we should find something that can

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750
we should find something that can
 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.959
we should find something that can
generalize but is self documenting and

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969
generalize but is self documenting and
 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.450
generalize but is self documenting and
captures these constraints so that if we

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460
captures these constraints so that if we
 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.730
captures these constraints so that if we
decide well we had a purple theme now we

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740
decide well we had a purple theme now we
 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.219
decide well we had a purple theme now we
need a blue theme we can reuse the name

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229
need a blue theme we can reuse the name
 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.840
need a blue theme we can reuse the name
of that color and reuse those

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850
of that color and reuse those
 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.370
of that color and reuse those
constraints so you could move from

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380
constraints so you could move from
 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.699
constraints so you could move from
purple to blue very smoothly so what are

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709
purple to blue very smoothly so what are
 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.350
purple to blue very smoothly so what are
we gonna call that well Oh

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360
we gonna call that well Oh
 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.090
we gonna call that well Oh
in the material palette we have these on

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100
in the material palette we have these on
 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.030
in the material palette we have these on
colors on primary means this is a

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040
colors on primary means this is a
 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.130
colors on primary means this is a
foreground color displayed on a primary

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140
foreground color displayed on a primary
 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.230
foreground color displayed on a primary
background and we ensure that it's going

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240
background and we ensure that it's going
 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.060
background and we ensure that it's going
to meet certain accessibility related

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070
to meet certain accessibility related
 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.370
to meet certain accessibility related
contrast ratios so you'll be able to

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380
contrast ratios so you'll be able to
 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.260
contrast ratios so you'll be able to
read the foreground text color against

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270
read the foreground text color against
 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.150
read the foreground text color against
the background we have on secondary

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160
the background we have on secondary
 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.650
the background we have on secondary
which does the same thing for secondary

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660
which does the same thing for secondary
 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.510
which does the same thing for secondary
so if we're displaying something on that

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520
so if we're displaying something on that
 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.640
so if we're displaying something on that
light blue color it would be black text

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650
light blue color it would be black text
 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.900
light blue color it would be black text
if we're displaying something on this

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910
if we're displaying something on this
 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.390
if we're displaying something on this
purple color it would be white text so

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400
purple color it would be white text so
 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.250
purple color it would be white text so
we can use these to generate the new

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260
we can use these to generate the new
 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.730
we can use these to generate the new
name for this lighter primary color what

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740
name for this lighter primary color what
 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.800
name for this lighter primary color what
should we call that well we're gonna use

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810
should we call that well we're gonna use
 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.560
should we call that well we're gonna use
on primary so that determines the

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570
on primary so that determines the
 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.170
on primary so that determines the
foreground color protection for

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180
foreground color protection for
 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.640
foreground color protection for
background color protection we want to

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650
background color protection we want to
 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.470
background color protection we want to
make sure that it contrasts a little bit

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480
make sure that it contrasts a little bit
 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.600
make sure that it contrasts a little bit
with primary so we'll include both of

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610
with primary so we'll include both of
 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:58.860
with primary so we'll include both of
these in the name we can call it

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870
these in the name we can call it
 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.170
these in the name we can call it
something like primary lights which

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180
something like primary lights which
 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.780
something like primary lights which
seems incredibly straightforward and it

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790
seems incredibly straightforward and it
 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.540
seems incredibly straightforward and it
is so you can tell your designer hey

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550
is so you can tell your designer hey
 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.250
is so you can tell your designer hey
every time we're talking about this

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260
every time we're talking about this
 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.229
every time we're talking about this
lighter version of our primary color

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239
lighter version of our primary color
 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.449
lighter version of our primary color
let's refer to that as primary light and

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459
let's refer to that as primary light and
 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.490
let's refer to that as primary light and
it's going to have these constraints for

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500
it's going to have these constraints for
 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.830
it's going to have these constraints for
foreground colors and background color

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840
foreground colors and background color
 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.650
foreground colors and background color
protection so if your designer decides

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660
protection so if your designer decides
 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.330
protection so if your designer decides
well in this next screen we want it to

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340
well in this next screen we want it to
 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.070
well in this next screen we want it to
be blue instead of purple we can

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080
be blue instead of purple we can
 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.140
be blue instead of purple we can
continue to use the same constraints on

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150
continue to use the same constraints on
 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.850
continue to use the same constraints on
this color and use our semantically

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860
this color and use our semantically
 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.170
this color and use our semantically
defined color name in our theme as well

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180
defined color name in our theme as well
 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.030
defined color name in our theme as well
alright similarly we provide common

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040
alright similarly we provide common
 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.910
alright similarly we provide common
patterns for text appearances so here

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920
patterns for text appearances so here
 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.670
patterns for text appearances so here
you see on the Left we have headline

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680
you see on the Left we have headline
 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.340
you see on the Left we have headline
over line body these are semantically

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350
over line body these are semantically
 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.229
over line body these are semantically
defined terms they're meaningful names

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239
defined terms they're meaningful names
 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.660
defined terms they're meaningful names
for where these appearances are going to

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670
for where these appearances are going to
 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.970
for where these appearances are going to
be used and that determines the pixel

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980
be used and that determines the pixel
 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.620
be used and that determines the pixel
size that determines the font weights

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630
size that determines the font weights
 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.420
size that determines the font weights
that can determine the font itself and

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430
that can determine the font itself and
 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.030
that can determine the font itself and
that's going to determine the color on

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040
that's going to determine the color on
 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.830
that's going to determine the color on
the right we see what these values

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840
the right we see what these values
 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.440
the right we see what these values
actually map to so in this case headline

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450
actually map to so in this case headline
 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.120
actually map to so in this case headline
is going to be Roboto and in fact we're

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130
is going to be Roboto and in fact we're
 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.920
is going to be Roboto and in fact we're
using Roboto throughout our entire app

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930
using Roboto throughout our entire app
 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.170

however if we decided that instead we

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180
however if we decided that instead we
 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.310
however if we decided that instead we
wanted to use let's say Comic Sans we

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320
wanted to use let's say Comic Sans we
 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.050
wanted to use let's say Comic Sans we
could make our headline map to Comic

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060
could make our headline map to Comic
 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.490
could make our headline map to Comic
Sans we wouldn't have to go through and

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500
Sans we wouldn't have to go through and
 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.220
Sans we wouldn't have to go through and
create a new style everywhere in our

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.020
create a new style everywhere in our
application because we do have these

application because we do have these
 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.319
application because we do have these
names that imply how they're used so

names that imply how they're used so
 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.420
names that imply how they're used so
always make sure to use meaningful names

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430
always make sure to use meaningful names
 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.219
always make sure to use meaningful names
when you're extracting patterns from

these somewhere start a doc that you

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200
these somewhere start a doc that you

available in material I'm sure but
that's a good starting place to get a

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770
that's a good starting place to get a
 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.080
that's a good starting place to get a
sense of how to name them and how to

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090
sense of how to name them and how to
 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.200
sense of how to name them and how to
talk about them and part of that is

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210
talk about them and part of that is
 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.000
talk about them and part of that is
avoid hard coding values so when you get

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010
avoid hard coding values so when you get

avoid hard coding values so when you get
a mock that just says this is the hex

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590
a mock that just says this is the hex
 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.630
a mock that just says this is the hex
color for a 360 F make sure that you

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:43.640
color for a 360 F make sure that you
 

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.520
color for a 360 F make sure that you
push back on that and say no this isn't

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:45.530
push back on that and say no this isn't
 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.500
push back on that and say no this isn't
a hex color this color has some sort of

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510
a hex color this color has some sort of
 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.840
a hex color this color has some sort of
meaning and we need to be able to

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:49.850
meaning and we need to be able to
 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.240
meaning and we need to be able to
smoothly transition from this hex color

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250
smoothly transition from this hex color
 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.470
smoothly transition from this hex color
to a hex color with similar constraints

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:55.480
to a hex color with similar constraints
 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.970
to a hex color with similar constraints
all right so now Nick is going to talk a

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:57.980
all right so now Nick is going to talk a
 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.160
all right so now Nick is going to talk a
little bit more about what this means in

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:00.170
little bit more about what this means in
 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:05.260
little bit more about what this means in
implementation and key right so we

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270
implementation and key right so we
 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.330
implementation and key right so we
talked a lot about them and about

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.340
talked a lot about them and about
 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.030
talked a lot about them and about
supporting different semantical

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:10.040
supporting different semantical
 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.890
supporting different semantical
semantically named values in your

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900
semantically named values in your
 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.990
semantically named values in your
applications and what that means on

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000
applications and what that means on
 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.340
applications and what that means on
Android is essentially it can be

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:15.350
Android is essentially it can be
 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.350
Android is essentially it can be
implemented as theme attributes and

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360
implemented as theme attributes and
 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.730
implemented as theme attributes and
Allen says something really interesting

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:18.740
Allen says something really interesting
 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.440
Allen says something really interesting
there I said what happens if your design

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:20.450
there I said what happens if your design
 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.060
there I said what happens if your design
changes and all of a sudden instead of a

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.070
changes and all of a sudden instead of a
 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.530
changes and all of a sudden instead of a
purple theme you have a blue theme and

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:23.540
purple theme you have a blue theme and
 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.780
purple theme you have a blue theme and
how do you apply that these semantic

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:25.790
how do you apply that these semantic
 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:27.370
how do you apply that these semantic
names protect you almost against these

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:27.380
names protect you almost against these
 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.710
names protect you almost against these
cases and it's actually more widespread

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:29.720
cases and it's actually more widespread
 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.570
cases and it's actually more widespread
than you might realize and I'll go dig

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:31.580
than you might realize and I'll go dig
 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.400
than you might realize and I'll go dig
into that a little bit so if you want to

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:33.410
into that a little bit so if you want to
 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.500
into that a little bit so if you want to
have areas of your app or screens which

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:35.510
have areas of your app or screens which
 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:37.390
have areas of your app or screens which
can support this kind of theming there

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:37.400
can support this kind of theming there
 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.260
can support this kind of theming there
are different ways you could achieve

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:38.270
are different ways you could achieve
 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.400
are different ways you could achieve
this

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:39.410
this
 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.080
this
one way might be that you just you know

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:41.090
one way might be that you just you know
 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.150
one way might be that you just you know
say define different styles so in this

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160
say define different styles so in this
 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.060
say define different styles so in this
one scenario I'm gonna surpass tile to

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.070
one scenario I'm gonna surpass tile to
 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.170
one scenario I'm gonna surpass tile to
give it a certain appearance we call

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:47.180
give it a certain appearance we call
 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.970
give it a certain appearance we call
that style one and in another scenario I

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:48.980
that style one and in another scenario I
 

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.200
that style one and in another scenario I
want it to look different so I'll give

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.210
want it to look different so I'll give
 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:51.660
want it to look different so I'll give
it another style on style too

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:51.670
it another style on style too
 

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.680
it another style on style too
the problem with this approach is that

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:53.690
the problem with this approach is that
 

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:55.210
the problem with this approach is that
there's probably going to end up being a

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:55.220
there's probably going to end up being a
 

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.010
there's probably going to end up being a
lot of duplication between start one and

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:57.020
lot of duplication between start one and
 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.380
lot of duplication between start one and
style 2 and there's now two places for

00:06:59.380 --> 00:06:59.390
style 2 and there's now two places for
 

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.140
style 2 and there's now two places for
you to maintain or bug fix or you know

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:02.150
you to maintain or bug fix or you know
 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.870
you to maintain or bug fix or you know
maybe refactor at some point using these

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:04.880
maybe refactor at some point using these
 

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.270
maybe refactor at some point using these
semantical pointers to kind of describe

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.280
semantical pointers to kind of describe
 

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.160
semantical pointers to kind of describe
what the appearance should be like and

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:09.170
what the appearance should be like and
 

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:11.440
what the appearance should be like and
or in kind of coding terms it's going to

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:11.450
or in kind of coding terms it's going to
 

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.390
or in kind of coding terms it's going to
end up as a theme attribute and protect

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:13.400
end up as a theme attribute and protect
 

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.610
end up as a theme attribute and protect
you against this so while it we might be

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:15.620
you against this so while it we might be
 

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.410
you against this so while it we might be
more work to kind of like establish this

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:17.420
more work to kind of like establish this
 

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.480
more work to kind of like establish this
language and to set up your Styles to

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:19.490
language and to set up your Styles to
 

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:22.420
language and to set up your Styles to
refer back to female beauty what it does

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:22.430
refer back to female beauty what it does
 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.730
refer back to female beauty what it does
is it ends up with just a single place a

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:24.740
is it ends up with just a single place a
 

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.040
is it ends up with just a single place a
single style and that will refer back to

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.050
single style and that will refer back to
 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:29.530
single style and that will refer back to
the theme attributes defined for a given

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:29.540
the theme attributes defined for a given
 

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.050
the theme attributes defined for a given
theme and the benefits of this is it's

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:32.060
theme and the benefits of this is it's
 

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.220
theme and the benefits of this is it's
going to reduce that duplication you

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:33.230
going to reduce that duplication you
 

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:34.780
going to reduce that duplication you
don't end up with like two styles which

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:34.790
don't end up with like two styles which
 

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:36.580
don't end up with like two styles which
are 80% the same but you know have the

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:36.590
are 80% the same but you know have the
 

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:38.260
are 80% the same but you know have the
potential to diverge in the future which

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:38.270
potential to diverge in the future which
 

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:41.500
potential to diverge in the future which
they will and it also localizes the

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:41.510
they will and it also localizes the
 

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:43.690
they will and it also localizes the
modifications so that means that if you

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:43.700
modifications so that means that if you
 

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.970
modifications so that means that if you
need to change an attribute you just go

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:45.980
need to change an attribute you just go
 

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.590
need to change an attribute you just go
to that one place where it's defined and

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:47.600
to that one place where it's defined and
 

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.700
to that one place where it's defined and
change that rather than have to track it

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:48.710
change that rather than have to track it
 

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:50.380
change that rather than have to track it
down where it's leaked out into all the

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:50.390
down where it's leaked out into all the
 

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:52.000
down where it's leaked out into all the
variety of styles you have across your

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:52.010
variety of styles you have across your
 

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:54.910
variety of styles you have across your
code base it also has a benefit I think

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:54.920
code base it also has a benefit I think
 

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.950
code base it also has a benefit I think
of consolidation how many times have you

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:56.960
of consolidation how many times have you
 

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.710
of consolidation how many times have you
opened your colors XML file and found 50

00:07:59.710 --> 00:07:59.720
opened your colors XML file and found 50
 

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.360
opened your colors XML file and found 50
different shades of very similar looking

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:01.370
different shades of very similar looking
 

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:03.310
different shades of very similar looking
colors and then you see a mark and it's

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:03.320
colors and then you see a mark and it's
 

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.660
colors and then you see a mark and it's
not quite the same color and you go I

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:04.670
not quite the same color and you go I
 

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:05.920
not quite the same color and you go I
don't know I'll just create another

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:05.930
don't know I'll just create another
 

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:07.510
don't know I'll just create another
color resource because it's just me that

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:07.520
color resource because it's just me that
 

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.670
color resource because it's just me that
is that and it's kind of like protects

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:09.680
is that and it's kind of like protects
 

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.870
is that and it's kind of like protects
you against this you really really

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:10.880
you against this you really really
 

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.190
you against this you really really
really want to kind of condense it down

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:12.200
really want to kind of condense it down
 

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.740
really want to kind of condense it down
to this kind of small palette which is

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:14.750
to this kind of small palette which is
 

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:16.060
to this kind of small palette which is
used consistently throughout the

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:16.070
used consistently throughout the
 

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:17.140
used consistently throughout the
applications you have a nice looking

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:17.150
applications you have a nice looking
 

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:20.050
applications you have a nice looking
film so to sum up basically this

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:20.060
film so to sum up basically this
 

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.580
film so to sum up basically this
approach really really helps you with

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:21.590
approach really really helps you with
 

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:23.170
approach really really helps you with
the maintainability of your app and so

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:23.180
the maintainability of your app and so
 

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.030
the maintainability of your app and so
as such I really urge you to prefer

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:25.040
as such I really urge you to prefer
 

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.790
as such I really urge you to prefer
theme attributes where possible by which

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:27.800
theme attributes where possible by which
 

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.530
theme attributes where possible by which
I mean if you find yourself writing code

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:29.540
I mean if you find yourself writing code
 

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:30.730
I mean if you find yourself writing code
like this top line so he's saying the

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:30.740
like this top line so he's saying the
 

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.070
like this top line so he's saying the
text color should be you know this color

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:33.080
text color should be you know this color
 

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.380
text color should be you know this color
resource and almost think of that as a

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:35.390
resource and almost think of that as a
 

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:37.270
resource and almost think of that as a
code smell like just think for a second

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:37.280
code smell like just think for a second
 

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.550
code smell like just think for a second
hang on is there this layout is there

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:39.560
hang on is there this layout is there
 

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.170
hang on is there this layout is there
chance this might appear in a different

chance this might appear in a different
 

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:43.089
chance this might appear in a different
theme could this be like included in

00:08:43.089 --> 00:08:43.099
theme could this be like included in
 

00:08:43.099 --> 00:08:44.710
theme could this be like included in
like a different area of the application

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:44.720
like a different area of the application
 

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.920
like a different area of the application
and if so should I be instead be looking

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:47.930
and if so should I be instead be looking
 

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:49.900
and if so should I be instead be looking
at this bottom form using the question

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:49.910
at this bottom form using the question
 

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:51.550
at this bottom form using the question
mark actress in tax which refer it is

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:51.560
mark actress in tax which refer it is
 

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.910
mark actress in tax which refer it is
how you refer to these theme attributes

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:54.920
how you refer to these theme attributes
 

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:58.250
how you refer to these theme attributes
so we talked about the importance of

00:08:58.250 --> 00:08:58.260
so we talked about the importance of
 

00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:59.210
so we talked about the importance of
having these kind of semantically

00:08:59.210 --> 00:08:59.220
having these kind of semantically
 

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.710
having these kind of semantically
pointers but like how might your theme

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:00.720
pointers but like how might your theme
 

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.260
pointers but like how might your theme
vary so hopefully everyone's familiar

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:03.270
vary so hopefully everyone's familiar
 

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.390
vary so hopefully everyone's familiar
that you can set a theme directly on an

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:05.400
that you can set a theme directly on an
 

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.770
that you can set a theme directly on an
activity so in this example two

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:06.780
activity so in this example two
 

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.050
activity so in this example two
activities are using material components

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:09.060
activities are using material components
 

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:10.760
activities are using material components
which is a dark theme and then a light

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:10.770
which is a dark theme and then a light
 

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:14.630
which is a dark theme and then a light
variant or perhaps you're using night

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640
variant or perhaps you're using night
 

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.670
variant or perhaps you're using night
mode like an ally mentioned before and

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:16.680
mode like an ally mentioned before and
 

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.500
mode like an ally mentioned before and
it's also talked about in the cost of a

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:18.510
it's also talked about in the cost of a
 

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:21.230
it's also talked about in the cost of a
pixel talked earlier today so this is a

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:21.240
pixel talked earlier today so this is a
 

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.790
pixel talked earlier today so this is a
theme which will change between dark and

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800
theme which will change between dark and
 

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:26.540
theme which will change between dark and
light depending on the time of day but

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:26.550
light depending on the time of day but
 

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:27.890
light depending on the time of day but
what happens if you have a screen like

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:27.900
what happens if you have a screen like
 

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.690
what happens if you have a screen like
this which is from and this is a Google

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:29.700
this which is from and this is a Google
 

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.790
this which is from and this is a Google
i/o app where we have largely similar

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:31.800
i/o app where we have largely similar
 

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.160
i/o app where we have largely similar
content so most of these list items are

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:34.170
content so most of these list items are
 

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:35.960
content so most of these list items are
the same but the design called for some

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:35.970
the same but the design called for some
 

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:37.370
the same but the design called for some
of them to be light on dark I'm Sun to

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:37.380
of them to be light on dark I'm Sun to
 

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:40.340
of them to be light on dark I'm Sun to
be on dark on light I mean you can think

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:40.350
be on dark on light I mean you can think
 

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:41.690
be on dark on light I mean you can think
of ways you might implement this as

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:41.700
of ways you might implement this as
 

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.300
of ways you might implement this as
separate layouts or perhaps setting text

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:44.310
separate layouts or perhaps setting text
 

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:46.160
separate layouts or perhaps setting text
colors in unbind or something like that

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:46.170
colors in unbind or something like that
 

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:47.900
colors in unbind or something like that
but both of those basically either

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:47.910
but both of those basically either
 

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:49.220
but both of those basically either
leaking out the sliding information

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:49.230
leaking out the sliding information
 

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:51.200
leaking out the sliding information

beyond where you want it or liter and
 

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:52.280
beyond where you want it or liter and
like an explosion of more and

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:52.290
like an explosion of more and

like an explosion of more and
maintenance instead what you probably

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:54.330
maintenance instead what you probably
 

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.740
maintenance instead what you probably
want to do is look at applying themes

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:56.750
want to do is look at applying themes
 

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:58.790
want to do is look at applying themes
the view level rather than ever the

00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:58.800
the view level rather than ever the
 

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.070
the view level rather than ever the
whole activity level and so the theme

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:01.080
whole activity level and so the theme
 

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.620
whole activity level and so the theme
attribute was added not theme attributes

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:03.630
attribute was added not theme attributes
 

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.870
attribute was added not theme attributes
the attribute Android Quillen theme was

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:05.880
the attribute Android Quillen theme was
 

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.660
the attribute Android Quillen theme was
added in API 21 but also back ported

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:08.670
added in API 21 but also back ported
 

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:10.850
added in API 21 but also back ported
through Android X so in this you can set

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:10.860
through Android X so in this you can set
 

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.660
through Android X so in this you can set
a theme on a view or a view group and

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:13.670
a theme on a view or a view group and
 

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:16.220
a theme on a view or a view group and
apply a different theme to a subsection

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:16.230
apply a different theme to a subsection
 

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:18.650
apply a different theme to a subsection
of your view hierarchy and so in these

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:18.660
of your view hierarchy and so in these
 

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.090
of your view hierarchy and so in these
examples here you might say you have a

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:20.100
examples here you might say you have a
 

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:21.650
examples here you might say you have a
light theme and then apply a dark

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:21.660
light theme and then apply a dark
 

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:23.950
light theme and then apply a dark
portion of it or vice versa

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:23.960
portion of it or vice versa
 

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.150
portion of it or vice versa
you can do the same thing in code if

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:26.160
you can do the same thing in code if
 

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.560
you can do the same thing in code if

important to emphasize that fact that it

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:36.930
important to emphasize that fact that it
 

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:41.030
important to emphasize that fact that it
is overlaid that means that you have an

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.980

existing theme in any values from the
 

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:44.210

theme you set on top of it are going to
 

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.640
theme you set on top of it are going to
be applied on top so you need to be a

be applied on top so you need to be a
 

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:48.320

little bit conscious of this fact in

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:48.330
little bit conscious of this fact in
 

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.829

for example if I was using just material

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:55.830
for example if I was using just material
 

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:57.110

material components off dark they define
a lot of the same attributes and you

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:00.630
a lot of the same attributes and you
 

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.600
a lot of the same attributes and you
might be relying on some of the

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:02.610
might be relying on some of the
 

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:04.190
might be relying on some of the

attributes you set in the first theme to
 

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.510
attributes you set in the first theme to
still be present so you might overwrite

still be present so you might overwrite
 

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.680

too much
 

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:07.940

conversely you want to make sure the
 

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:10.100

applied throughout the platform so we're
 

00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:59.720
applied throughout the platform so we're
going to do a whirlwind tour of the

00:11:59.720 --> 00:11:59.730
going to do a whirlwind tour of the
 

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:01.520

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:08.760
setting in your application themes so at
 

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.760
setting in your application themes so at
any point in your application it's good

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:10.770
any point in your application it's good
 

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:12.680
any point in your application it's good
to have background understanding that it

it this way on-screen so if we want to

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:22.800
it this way on-screen so if we want to
 

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.940
it this way on-screen so if we want to
set this color for a single button how

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:25.950
set this color for a single button how
 

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:29.410
set this color for a single button how
would we do that well let's dive into

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:29.420
would we do that well let's dive into
 

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:32.300
would we do that well let's dive into
the way that this gets resolved at

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:32.310
the way that this gets resolved at
 

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:34.430
the way that this gets resolved at
runtime so we have button defined in

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:34.440
runtime so we have button defined in
 

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.700
runtime so we have button defined in

this works if you haven't watched that
go watch it the important part is that

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:48.990
go watch it the important part is that
 

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:51.020
go watch it the important part is that
the button style that you see here is

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:51.030
the button style that you see here is
 

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:54.470
the button style that you see here is
pulled from the theme that the theme of

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:07.560
theme if we have not redefined it
 

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.860
theme if we have not redefined it
otherwise so the default value there

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:09.870
otherwise so the default value there
 

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:11.630
otherwise so the default value there
that you'll see in themes themes

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:11.640
that you'll see in themes themes
 

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.480

material XML is widget material button

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:14.490
material XML is widget material button
 

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:16.460
material XML is widget material button
where do we find the definition for

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:16.470
where do we find the definition for
 

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:18.890
where do we find the definition for
widget material button over in styles

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:18.900
widget material button over in styles
 

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:19.910
widget material button over in styles
material so

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:19.920
material so
 

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.290
material so
we can see here the background is

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:21.300
we can see here the background is
 

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.300
we can see here the background is
defined to be this button default

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:23.310
defined to be this button default
 

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:25.910
defined to be this button default
material drawable we'll also notice that

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:25.920
material drawable we'll also notice that
 

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.949
material drawable we'll also notice that
right below that bordered ink button

00:13:27.949 --> 00:13:27.959
right below that bordered ink button
 

00:13:27.959 --> 00:13:30.440
right below that bordered ink button
style we have a colored border ding

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:30.450
style we have a colored border ding
 

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:33.019
style we have a colored border ding
button style which if we've looked over

00:13:33.019 --> 00:13:33.029
button style which if we've looked over
 

00:13:33.029 --> 00:13:34.490
button style which if we've looked over
the material spec we realized this

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:34.500
the material spec we realized this
 

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:35.750
the material spec we realized this
probably going to be a little bit closer

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760
probably going to be a little bit closer
 

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.790
probably going to be a little bit closer
because it provides a color in the

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:37.800
because it provides a color in the
 

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.639
because it provides a color in the
button so let's dive into the background

00:13:40.639 --> 00:13:40.649
button so let's dive into the background
 

00:13:40.649 --> 00:13:42.920
button so let's dive into the background
that's used there to see what gets

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:42.930
that's used there to see what gets
 

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:44.300
that's used there to see what gets
pulled from our theme and what we might

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:44.310
pulled from our theme and what we might
 

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:47.120
pulled from our theme and what we might
be able to change in the button color

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:47.130
be able to change in the button color
 

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:49.340
be able to change in the button color
material XML you'll notice the XML file

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:49.350
material XML you'll notice the XML file
 

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:51.290
material XML you'll notice the XML file
names match up exactly with the drawable

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:51.300
names match up exactly with the drawable
 

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.180
names match up exactly with the drawable
names so there's an easy chain that you

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:53.190
names so there's an easy chain that you
 

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:55.550
names so there's an easy chain that you
can follow we have a shape it's a

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:55.560
can follow we have a shape it's a
 

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.829
can follow we have a shape it's a
rectangle it is colored with a tint

00:13:57.829 --> 00:13:57.839
rectangle it is colored with a tint
 

00:13:57.839 --> 00:13:59.720
rectangle it is colored with a tint
which is our button colored background

00:13:59.720 --> 00:13:59.730
which is our button colored background
 

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:02.509
which is our button colored background
material this gets applied to the white

00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:02.519
material this gets applied to the white
 

00:14:02.519 --> 00:14:05.210
material this gets applied to the white
color of the shape so it's got a solid

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:05.220
color of the shape so it's got a solid
 

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.430
color of the shape so it's got a solid
white fill here so let's dig into that

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440
white fill here so let's dig into that
 

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.470
white fill here so let's dig into that
tint and see what's gonna be applied on

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:09.480
tint and see what's gonna be applied on
 

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:12.650
tint and see what's gonna be applied on
top of that white color it is our color

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:12.660
top of that white color it is our color
 

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:14.689
top of that white color it is our color
accents so this is a color state list

00:14:14.689 --> 00:14:14.699
accents so this is a color state list
 

00:14:14.699 --> 00:14:16.790
accents so this is a color state list
it is named button colored background

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:16.800
it is named button colored background
 

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.579
it is named button colored background
material XML which is the exact name of

00:14:19.579 --> 00:14:19.589
material XML which is the exact name of
 

00:14:19.589 --> 00:14:20.960
material XML which is the exact name of
the color that we were just looking at

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:20.970
the color that we were just looking at
 

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:24.009
the color that we were just looking at
again a very clear line of indirection

00:14:24.009 --> 00:14:24.019
again a very clear line of indirection
 

00:14:24.019 --> 00:14:26.630
again a very clear line of indirection
so where does this color accent come

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:26.640
so where does this color accent come
 

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.579
so where does this color accent come
from well because it's a theme attribute

00:14:28.579 --> 00:14:28.589
from well because it's a theme attribute
 

00:14:28.589 --> 00:14:31.009
from well because it's a theme attribute
it's gonna come from whatever exists in

00:14:31.009 --> 00:14:31.019
it's gonna come from whatever exists in
 

00:14:31.019 --> 00:14:33.319
it's gonna come from whatever exists in
our application theme as I mentioned

00:14:33.319 --> 00:14:33.329
our application theme as I mentioned
 

00:14:33.329 --> 00:14:35.030
our application theme as I mentioned
that inherits from material and if we

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040
that inherits from material and if we
 

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.710
that inherits from material and if we
haven't redefined color accent to be

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720
haven't redefined color accent to be
 

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.480
haven't redefined color accent to be
anything else it will be the default

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:38.490
anything else it will be the default
 

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:41.240
anything else it will be the default
teal so here all the levels of

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:41.250
teal so here all the levels of
 

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:42.500
teal so here all the levels of
indirection that we've just looked at

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:42.510
indirection that we've just looked at
 

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:44.960
indirection that we've just looked at
some of the important ones are if we

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:44.970
some of the important ones are if we
 

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:47.300
some of the important ones are if we
want to change the style for all buttons

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:47.310
want to change the style for all buttons
 

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:48.980
want to change the style for all buttons
that get inflated that's our button

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:48.990
that get inflated that's our button
 

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:50.660
that get inflated that's our button
style and the theme that we could set

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:50.670
style and the theme that we could set
 

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:53.900
style and the theme that we could set
the button style that we're getting by

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:53.910
the button style that we're getting by
 

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:56.449
the button style that we're getting by
default is widget material button we can

00:14:56.449 --> 00:14:56.459
default is widget material button we can
 

00:14:56.459 --> 00:14:57.680
default is widget material button we can
change that to something else like

00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:57.690
change that to something else like
 

00:14:57.690 --> 00:14:59.750
change that to something else like
button dot colored in our theme if we

00:14:59.750 --> 00:14:59.760
button dot colored in our theme if we
 

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:03.050
button dot colored in our theme if we
wanted color buttons everywhere we can

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:03.060
wanted color buttons everywhere we can
 

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:04.730
wanted color buttons everywhere we can
also change our color to accent which is

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:04.740
also change our color to accent which is
 

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:06.920
also change our color to accent which is
what gets loaded by the colored button

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:06.930
what gets loaded by the colored button
 

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:08.689
what gets loaded by the colored button
style so if we set that in our theme

00:15:08.689 --> 00:15:08.699
style so if we set that in our theme
 

00:15:08.699 --> 00:15:10.880
style so if we set that in our theme
that gets used everywhere we'll see that

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:10.890
that gets used everywhere we'll see that
 

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:15.170
that gets used everywhere we'll see that
color everywhere but what we want to do

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:15.180
color everywhere but what we want to do
 

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:17.120
color everywhere but what we want to do
is one button so what would happen if we

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:17.130
is one button so what would happen if we
 

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:18.860
is one button so what would happen if we
set button style on our activity theme

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:18.870
set button style on our activity theme
 

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:21.559
set button style on our activity theme
we would see color buttons everywhere we

00:15:21.559 --> 00:15:21.569
we would see color buttons everywhere we
 

00:15:21.569 --> 00:15:23.360
we would see color buttons everywhere we
don't want to do that what would happen

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:23.370
don't want to do that what would happen
 

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:25.309
don't want to do that what would happen
if we set it in the style attribute on

00:15:25.309 --> 00:15:25.319
if we set it in the style attribute on
 

00:15:25.319 --> 00:15:27.769
if we set it in the style attribute on
our button in XML we would see it only

00:15:27.769 --> 00:15:27.779
our button in XML we would see it only
 

00:15:27.779 --> 00:15:29.360
our button in XML we would see it only
on that single button which is what we

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:29.370
on that single button which is what we
 

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:31.400
on that single button which is what we
want but now we're getting the default

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:31.410
want but now we're getting the default
 

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:33.530
want but now we're getting the default
teal color from our theme so

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:33.540
teal color from our theme so
 

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:36.170
teal color from our theme so
how can we fix that well what if we set

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:36.180
how can we fix that well what if we set
 

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:38.720
how can we fix that well what if we set
color accents on our activity theme now

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:38.730
color accents on our activity theme now
 

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:40.699
color accents on our activity theme now
we're getting that blue button but we're

00:15:40.699 --> 00:15:40.709
we're getting that blue button but we're
 

00:15:40.709 --> 00:15:42.620
we're getting that blue button but we're
also getting blue switches and blue

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:42.630
also getting blue switches and blue
 

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:44.120
also getting blue switches and blue
everything else that inherits color

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:44.130
everything else that inherits color
 

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:46.370
everything else that inherits color
accent if you just do a search over the

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:46.380
accent if you just do a search over the
 

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:48.350
accent if you just do a search over the
platform XML files for color accent

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:48.360
platform XML files for color accent
 

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.569
platform XML files for color accent
you'll see it in a lot of places so

00:15:50.569 --> 00:15:50.579
you'll see it in a lot of places so
 

00:15:50.579 --> 00:15:53.090
you'll see it in a lot of places so
instead we can set it in

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:53.100
instead we can set it in
 

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:54.889
instead we can set it in
we could try setting it in layout XML

00:15:54.889 --> 00:15:54.899
we could try setting it in layout XML
 

00:15:54.899 --> 00:15:56.150
we could try setting it in layout XML
you'll notice that this does absolutely

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:56.160
you'll notice that this does absolutely
 

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.309
you'll notice that this does absolutely
nothing because it's a theme attribute

00:15:58.309 --> 00:15:58.319
nothing because it's a theme attribute
 

00:15:58.319 --> 00:15:59.600
nothing because it's a theme attribute
and you shouldn't try to set theme

00:15:59.600 --> 00:15:59.610
and you shouldn't try to set theme
 

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:01.790
and you shouldn't try to set theme
attributes directly in layout XML theme

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:01.800
attributes directly in layout XML theme
 

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.970
attributes directly in layout XML theme
attributes get set in your theme so what

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:04.980
attributes get set in your theme so what
 

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:06.590
attributes get set in your theme so what
we'll actually do is create a theme

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:06.600
we'll actually do is create a theme
 

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.180
we'll actually do is create a theme
overlay as Nick was just talking about

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:08.190
overlay as Nick was just talking about
 

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:11.180
overlay as Nick was just talking about
that sets just that color and contains

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:11.190
that sets just that color and contains
 

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:13.280
that sets just that color and contains
nothing else we will apply that to the

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:13.290
nothing else we will apply that to the
 

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:14.930
nothing else we will apply that to the
button using Android theme in layout XML

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:14.940
button using Android theme in layout XML
 

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:18.110
button using Android theme in layout XML
and we'll get what we wanted so back to

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:18.120
and we'll get what we wanted so back to
 

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.860
and we'll get what we wanted so back to
Nick for more implementation yes so I

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:21.870
Nick for more implementation yes so I
 

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:23.150
Nick for more implementation yes so I
said you should prefer theme and

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:23.160
said you should prefer theme and
 

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.220
said you should prefer theme and
attributes where you can but to do so

something we have learned is to be
 

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.169
something we have learned is to be
extremely handy so like the example we

00:19:15.169 --> 00:19:15.179
extremely handy so like the example we
 

00:19:15.179 --> 00:19:17.510

left out before you can define a single
color state this which provides these

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:18.840
color state this which provides these
 

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.630
color state this which provides these
different tints and/or colors for

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640
different tints and/or colors for
 

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.790
different tints and/or colors for
different states so this example is

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:22.800
different states so this example is
 

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.790
different states so this example is
taken from text primary and one of the

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:25.800
taken from text primary and one of the
 

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.200
taken from text primary and one of the
things I love about color statelets as

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:27.210
things I love about color statelets as
 

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:28.850
things I love about color statelets as
some of the improvements that arrived in

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:28.860
some of the improvements that arrived in
 

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:31.220
some of the improvements that arrived in
marshmallow 23 and which allowed you to

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:31.230
marshmallow 23 and which allowed you to
 

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:33.350
marshmallow 23 and which allowed you to
separate out the color and an alpha

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360
separate out the color and an alpha
 

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.630
separate out the color and an alpha
component and why this is great is

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:35.640
component and why this is great is
 

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:36.890
component and why this is great is
because this really protects you against

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:36.900
because this really protects you against
 

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:38.690
because this really protects you against
that explosion of like 20 different

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:38.700
that explosion of like 20 different
 

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:40.850
that explosion of like 20 different
asset ease of black you might have in

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:40.860
asset ease of black you might have in
 

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:43.549
asset ease of black you might have in
your colors file by actually separating

00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:43.559
your colors file by actually separating
 

00:19:43.559 --> 00:19:45.830
your colors file by actually separating
out the kind of the color information

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:45.840
out the kind of the color information
 

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.900
out the kind of the color information
from the Alpha information allows you to

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:47.910
from the Alpha information allows you to
 

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:50.270
from the Alpha information allows you to
define more specifically what you want

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:50.280
define more specifically what you want
 

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:51.830
define more specifically what you want
so here we're saying say this is a light

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:51.840
so here we're saying say this is a light
 

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.100
so here we're saying say this is a light
screen so color foreground will be dark

screen so color foreground will be dark
 

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:56.540
screen so color foreground will be dark
you can say the text should be black and

00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:56.550
you can say the text should be black and
 

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:58.090
you can say the text should be black and
it should have these different alphas

00:19:58.090 --> 00:19:58.100
it should have these different alphas
 

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:00.530
it should have these different alphas
depending if it's enabled or disabled in

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:00.540

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:01.240
depending if it's enabled or disabled in
these two

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:01.250
these two
 

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:02.950
these two
here so you don't have to have to find

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:02.960
here so you don't have to have to find
 

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:04.240
here so you don't have to have to find
all these different combinations you

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:04.250
all these different combinations you
 

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:05.800
all these different combinations you
defined specifically the semantically

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:05.810
defined specifically the semantically
 

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:08.530

thing to note is I've actually cheated

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:15.260
thing to note is I've actually cheated
 

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:16.750
thing to note is I've actually cheated
here and changed to the Android alpha 2

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:16.760
here and changed to the Android alpha 2
 

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:20.860

alpha because app compat backports this

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:20.870

cyclist but it requires you to use app
alpha and one thing to note is that the

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:28.790
alpha and one thing to note is that the
 

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:31.840
alpha and one thing to note is that the
alpha channel of the the color and the

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:31.850
alpha channel of the the color and the
 

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:33.970
alpha channel of the the color and the
alpha are combined and multiplied so be

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:33.980
alpha are combined and multiplied so be
 

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:35.470
alpha are combined and multiplied so be
careful don't specify don't do this

essentially if you specialize this is

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:37.490
essentially if you specialize this is
 

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:40.030
essentially if you specialize this is
like say a 50% white text if you don't

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:40.040
like say a 50% white text if you don't
 

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.820
like say a 50% white text if you don't
speak X and a 50% alpha you'll end up

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:42.830
speak X and a 50% alpha you'll end up
 

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:45.460
speak X and a 50% alpha you'll end up
with a 25% alford white so you probably

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:45.470
with a 25% alford white so you probably
 

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:47.170
with a 25% alford white so you probably
want to refer to colors which have full

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:47.180
want to refer to colors which have full
 

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.360
want to refer to colors which have full
alpha and then and only supply variable

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:49.370
alpha and then and only supply variable
 

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:51.720
alpha and then and only supply variable
alphas by the Alpha Channel separately

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:51.730
alphas by the Alpha Channel separately
 

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:54.070
alphas by the Alpha Channel separately
and like I said I've compat bakbox this

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:54.080
and like I said I've compat bakbox this
 

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.200
and like I said I've compat bakbox this
so use app compat resources to inflate

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:56.210
so use app compat resources to inflate
 

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:57.160
so use app compat resources to inflate
that in order to get this backwards

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:57.170
that in order to get this backwards
 

00:20:57.170 --> 00:20:58.750
that in order to get this backwards
compatible behavior and then you can

00:20:58.750 --> 00:20:58.760
compatible behavior and then you can
 

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:02.050
compatible behavior and then you can
apply those and to draw balls so overall

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:02.060
apply those and to draw balls so overall
 

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:05.440
apply those and to draw balls so overall
if you apply this theming and you can

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:05.450
if you apply this theming and you can
 

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:06.970
if you apply this theming and you can
get to something a state like this and

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:06.980
get to something a state like this and
 

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:09.040
get to something a state like this and
so on the left these look quite similar

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:09.050
so on the left these look quite similar
 

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:10.300
so on the left these look quite similar

essentially we just had to change a few

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:22.970
essentially we just had to change a few
 

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:24.850
essentially we just had to change a few
of these semantically named colors and

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:24.860
of these semantically named colors and
 

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:26.590
of these semantically named colors and
if we go back in this ripples outwards

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:26.600
if we go back in this ripples outwards
 

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.210
if we go back in this ripples outwards
