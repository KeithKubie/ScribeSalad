00:00:08.631 --> 00:00:11.130
DIRK STAHLECKER: So I thought
that this class would allow me

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.750
an opportunity to, first off,
create some sort of application

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.340
or product that would be
interesting and enjoyable

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.320
to make and, more importantly,
have an actual impact.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.920
It would be working with
someone and doing something

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.430
that would directly benefit
them and allow them to improve

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:31.980
their daily lives in some way.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.260
That gives it a lot more
meaning and a lot more power,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.670
and makes it a lot more
enjoyable of an experience

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:38.217
to create.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.500
So, I really wasn't
entirely sure

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.720
what it all would
entail initially.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.780
I knew we'd be working
with the clients,

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.940
and I knew we'd be
creating a product,

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.640
but I didn't realize
all of the focus that

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.530
would be put on
looking at the client,

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.380
the contextual
analysis, figuring out

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.430
what it is that the clients can
do, wants to do, is able to do.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.760
And there was a lot
of focus on features

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.610
other than directly creating the
piece of assistive technology.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.800
And I didn't expect that
that would be the case.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.137
But I realized it was
critical that that was there.

00:01:19.137 --> 00:01:20.970
Because to really make
something successful,

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.820
you have to understand all of
the context surrounding it.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.740
And to do something
that is really useful,

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.480
you have to know what it
is that the client needs.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.850
That's applicable both in an
assistive technology and just

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.020
in working toward
it for any client.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.940
ARTHI VEZHAVENDAN: So
I came into this class

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.810
hoping that I would be able to
work on a project that actually

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.260
had an impact, because most of
the courses I had taken at MIT,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.360
they were theoretical.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.990
And you just work
on problem sets,

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.970
and you hope to apply the things
that you learned after college.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.040
And so the last semester
and this semester,

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.470
I've been trying to find
courses where I can actually

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.830
use those skills immediately.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.670
And I feel like practicing
those skills is actually

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.420
what's going to help
me learn them better,

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.711
so learning through experience.

00:02:05.711 --> 00:02:07.790
And that's exactly what
I got out of this class.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.110
I was able to apply the web
design skills that I learned,

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.120
and also just the whole
design process that we

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.430
were told about, but actually
apply it into [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.620
DIRK STAHLECKER: I learned
that there is always

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.680
a lot more than meets the eye.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.220
I realized that
there's a lot of-- I

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.210
was surprised working
with both our client

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.840
and hearing about the
other clients in the class,

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.660
how much they were able to do,
even given their disabilities.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.309
They were very well able
to do quite a lot of things

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:50.350
that I wouldn't have
expected them to be able to.

00:02:53.438 --> 00:02:58.960
You have to really focus
on what their abilities are

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.360
and what their needs are.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.680
And I think having a client
there in the first place

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.420
gave us this level of
focus that is normally not

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.090
found in creating, in our
case, a software application.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.540
We're looking at
a particular user

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.740
and focusing on what one
particular person wants.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.250
And that made it a lot easier to
know what direction to take it,

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.310
rather than having some nebulous
group of our supposed users

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.090
out there that we didn't
actually know or interact with.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.800
I put in a lot of
time at the beginning

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.270
to understanding the context and
the client and the situation.

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.230
And it's really tempting to
jump right in and start coding,

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.060
and we didn't do that.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.340
And I'm glad we didn't
do that, because we

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.580
were able to
understand what it was

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.480
we were supposed to be doing
and what direction we needed

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.985
to take.

00:03:53.985 --> 00:03:55.860
So I think that's the
biggest piece of advice

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.706
there, is to not start
coding right away,

00:03:57.706 --> 00:03:59.955
but make sure you really
understand what you're doing.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.620
ARTHI VEZHAVENDAN: So we went
through a bunch of iterations.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.510
First, we started off
with-- Originally,

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.600
we just discussed
with our client

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.652
what he wanted,
what his needs were.

00:04:12.652 --> 00:04:14.110
So we had four
people in our group,

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.230
and we each
separated and came up

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.490
with our own ideas of what
the client might want.

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.480
And so we came up
with paper prototypes.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.870
And then we brought these four
versions into the next meeting

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.980
and discussed what--
Our client told us

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.500
what he liked about them and
what he didn't like about them.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.290
And so from that we've
collaborated and put those

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.284
four together into a
final paper prototype.

00:04:37.284 --> 00:04:38.950
And then just kept
iterating from there,

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.491
going back to our client, asking
what he liked about it, what

00:04:41.491 --> 00:04:42.700
he didn't like about it.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.070
And then once we had a
pretty finalized version

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.570
of what we were hoping to
get out of this project,

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.330
we went into actually
starting to code it

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.220
and separating the
tasks and everything.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.640
The most challenging
aspect was probably

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.020
while going through all
these iterations and coding,

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.360
I kind of want to say it was
the actual implementation.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.790
So coming up with the ideas
and everything it was great.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.000
It was like a lot of
creativity and trying

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.470
to fix these problems.

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.150
But then actually going
into the coding portion

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.990
was when we came
into the bugs of how

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.770
do we actually implement what
we want out of our project.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.950
We know that we want a
certain type of screen there.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.100
We know how we want the
user to interact with it.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.220
But how do we actually
do this technically?

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:37.560
And that was one of the
challenging parts of the class.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.090
DIRK STAHLECKER: I think
the blogs were really

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.327
a time for reflection
and thinking

00:05:42.327 --> 00:05:43.660
about what it was we were doing.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.260
I used the blogs, at
least, as sort of a way

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.660
to catalyze my analysis
of the subjects

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.510
and the material presented
in class and the things

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:55.850
we've been working on.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.590
So I took it and really
looked to analyze

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:05.250
some thought I had been having,
trying to figure out how to

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.500
[INAUDIBLE] one on, how to
make computers more accessible,

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.260
and ways in which that is
sort of fundamental in a lot

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.480
of the architecture and how it
makes it difficult to do that.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.530
Or just analyzing
different ways in which we

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:26.100
are able to allow
people with disabilities

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.370
to be more integrated
into society,

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:34.280
and how society has
to potentially change

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.830
their viewpoint a little
bit to allow that to happen

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:37.738
to a greater degree.

00:06:41.444 --> 00:06:43.860
ARTHI VEZHAVENDAN: The most
engaging aspect was definitely

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.160
working with all of the
people in the course,

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.800
So my three other team
members and our client,

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.490
which, like I said, you don't
entirely get in other courses.

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.190
And in this one,
you're sitting down

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:56.860
with the person who is going
to be using the product.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.725
And that was the most
engaging, because I

00:06:58.725 --> 00:07:00.100
knew it was going
to be fruitful,

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.040
and I knew something was going
to come out of it at the end.

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.300
DIRK STAHLECKER: I mean, as far
as an education perspective,

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.100
at least, on this, I found
this is a course where

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:17.630
I was motivated to
do the best I could,

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:21.310
not by getting a good
grade or even as much

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:24.630
about learning something
as it was about I really

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:26.140
wanted to help the client.

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.550
And I think it's the
client-centered focus

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.690
of the course that
really drives it.

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.600
And that is I feel the
most important aspect,

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.970
because when you're working
with someone one on one,

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:39.100
they're relying on you to
create something that you

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.540
know is going to help them.

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:43.720
You are really well
motivated to do the best

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.300
you can on that product.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:51.770
And I think that making sure
that that emphasis is retained

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:55.185
is the most important thing to
keep everyone really engaged

00:07:55.185 --> 00:07:57.060
in it and to get the
best quality of products

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.990
that it's possible
from a class like this.

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:04.140
And that's really the best
way to make it happen,

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:04.928
in my perspective.

00:08:07.774 --> 00:08:09.190
ARTHI VEZHAVENDAN:
You're creating

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:10.940
a product for your
client, but you're also

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.560
learning more about a
certain person's lifestyle.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.529
And so make sure
to go beyond what

00:08:15.529 --> 00:08:17.320
you're making as a
product, but get to know

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.192
your client as a person.

00:08:19.192 --> 00:08:21.400
And that's definitely going
to be even more fruitful,

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.900
because then you're
not just focused

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.920
on this one product,
product, product,

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:29.010
but you're learning more of
how does this one person have

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:32.380
to live with their
disabilities, and how can you

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.510
integrate so many other
things in your environment

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:38.883
to help them and these types of
people outside of the semester.
