00:00:01.184 --> 00:00:03.061
- [Instructor] The
countries of Kalos and Johto

00:00:03.061 --> 00:00:04.546
can produce two goods.

00:00:04.546 --> 00:00:07.330
Shiny charms and berries.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.016
Yep, you got to love these worlds

00:00:09.016 --> 00:00:12.095
created in these economics questions.

00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:14.455
The table below describe the production

00:00:14.455 --> 00:00:17.143
possibilities of each country in a day.

00:00:17.143 --> 00:00:18.778
So here it tells us that Kalos,

00:00:18.778 --> 00:00:21.329
if it puts all of its
energy behind charms,

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:23.322
it can produce 10 charms in a day.

00:00:23.322 --> 00:00:25.387
But if it put all of its
energy behind berries,

00:00:25.387 --> 00:00:27.975
it can produce 20 berries in a day.

00:00:27.975 --> 00:00:29.646
And then Johto, all of its energy

00:00:29.646 --> 00:00:34.348
behind charms, 25, all of its
energy behind berries, 75.

00:00:34.348 --> 00:00:36.479
Given these numbers are
based on both countries

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:40.380
having the same labor and capital inputs,

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.797
who has the absolute advantage in charms?

00:00:45.137 --> 00:00:48.443
So pause the video and see
if you can figure this out.

00:00:48.443 --> 00:00:50.100
All right, so let's just remind ourselves.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.256
Absolute advantage is just
who is more efficient?

00:00:53.256 --> 00:00:56.523
Who, given the same
inputs, can produce more?

00:00:56.523 --> 00:00:58.181
And they told us that these countries,

00:00:58.181 --> 00:01:00.921
they have the same labor
and capital inputs,

00:01:00.921 --> 00:01:02.142
so this is really just a question

00:01:02.142 --> 00:01:04.261
of who can produce more charms in a day?

00:01:04.261 --> 00:01:06.152
And you can see very clearly that Johto

00:01:06.152 --> 00:01:08.163
can produce more charms in a day.

00:01:08.163 --> 00:01:10.994
And so I would say Johto,

00:01:10.994 --> 00:01:13.827
because they produce, let me write

00:01:16.153 --> 00:01:17.303
that a little bit neater,

00:01:17.303 --> 00:01:20.053
they produce more charms per day.

00:01:23.811 --> 00:01:25.061
Charms per day.

00:01:26.254 --> 00:01:27.671
With same inputs.

00:01:29.627 --> 00:01:30.627
Same inputs.

00:01:32.206 --> 00:01:34.641
So they are more efficient.

00:01:34.641 --> 00:01:35.891
More efficient.

00:01:36.942 --> 00:01:39.592
So they have the absolute advantage.

00:01:39.592 --> 00:01:41.078
Now this is an interesting thing,

00:01:41.078 --> 00:01:43.110
because our intuition might say

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.124
well whoever has the absolute advantage,

00:01:45.124 --> 00:01:47.729
maybe they're the ones that
should be producing charms.

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.086
But this is what's interesting when

00:01:49.086 --> 00:01:50.586
we study comparative advantage.

00:01:50.586 --> 00:01:52.596
That is not always the case.

00:01:52.596 --> 00:01:55.625
And I suspect that this
question will lead us there.

00:01:55.625 --> 00:01:57.790
All right, next question.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.786
They say calculate the opportunity cost

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:01.369
in Kalos of charms.

00:02:02.955 --> 00:02:06.705
So the opportunity cost,
in Kalos, of charms.

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:11.833
So when Kalos decides
to produce 10 charms,

00:02:11.833 --> 00:02:14.450
they're trading off 20 berries.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.615
Or another way of thinking about it,

00:02:15.615 --> 00:02:19.218
it costs them 20 berries
to produce 10 charms.

00:02:19.218 --> 00:02:22.135
So we could say it costs 20 berries

00:02:27.104 --> 00:02:30.854
for 10 charms, which is
equal to two berries,

00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:37.588
two berries per charm, in Kalos.

00:02:41.512 --> 00:02:42.345
So there you have it.

00:02:42.345 --> 00:02:43.499
The opportunity cost, they trade off

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:45.155
two berries per charm.

00:02:45.155 --> 00:02:46.872
And actually, let me make
it a little column here.

00:02:46.872 --> 00:02:47.841
The opportunity cost.

00:02:47.841 --> 00:02:50.591
So this is two berries per charm.

00:02:52.478 --> 00:02:53.911
And I have a feeling, and if you're taking

00:02:53.911 --> 00:02:57.083
an exam, say an AP exam,
it's not a bad idea

00:02:57.083 --> 00:02:58.463
to just fill this thing out,

00:02:58.463 --> 00:02:59.405
so what is the opportunity cost,

00:02:59.405 --> 00:03:00.513
they haven't asked us that yet,

00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:02.122
but I'm just gonna do it really fast.

00:03:02.122 --> 00:03:06.107
What is the opportunity
cost of charms in Johto?

00:03:06.107 --> 00:03:08.837
Well, they are trading
off, to produce 25 charms,

00:03:08.837 --> 00:03:11.092
they trade off 75 berries.

00:03:11.092 --> 00:03:13.260
So this would be 75 divided by 25,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.427
this would be three berries per charm.

00:03:17.708 --> 00:03:22.554
75 berries for 25 charms
is three berries per charm.

00:03:22.554 --> 00:03:24.493
And if you want to know the
opportunity cost of berries,

00:03:24.493 --> 00:03:27.234
well you can just take the
reciprocal of each of these.

00:03:27.234 --> 00:03:29.613
So in Kalos, the opportunity cost

00:03:29.613 --> 00:03:32.696
is one half charms, charms per berry.

00:03:36.552 --> 00:03:40.719
And then in Johto, it is
one third charms per berry.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.028
That if they wanted to produce 25 berries,

00:03:48.028 --> 00:03:49.955
if they wanted to produce 75 berries,

00:03:49.955 --> 00:03:53.011
they would trade off 25 charms.

00:03:53.011 --> 00:03:55.736
So it would cost them 25
charms to produce 75 berries,

00:03:55.736 --> 00:03:57.894
or one third of a charm per berry.

00:03:57.894 --> 00:03:59.590
So I'm just doing a little bit of extra.

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:00.817
But then it's gonna be useful,

00:04:00.817 --> 00:04:02.346
because in the next
question, they actually

00:04:02.346 --> 00:04:05.797
are asking us, who, we'll
scroll up a little bit.

00:04:05.797 --> 00:04:08.311
They're saying who has
the comparative advantage

00:04:08.311 --> 00:04:10.709
in berries, explain.

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.903
So berries, whoever has
the lower opportunity cost

00:04:13.903 --> 00:04:15.919
has the comparative advantage.

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:19.624
So we see here that Johto has the lower

00:04:19.624 --> 00:04:21.916
opportunity cost in berries.

00:04:21.916 --> 00:04:24.666
One third is lower than one half.

00:04:25.623 --> 00:04:28.477
It's a lower opportunity
cost of producing a berry.

00:04:28.477 --> 00:04:30.894
So Johto has one third charms

00:04:37.472 --> 00:04:41.222
per berry opportunity
cost, opportunity cost.

00:04:45.066 --> 00:04:47.316
Which is lower than Kalos',

00:04:52.215 --> 00:04:56.382
Kalos' one half charms per
berry opportunity cost.

00:05:02.435 --> 00:05:05.724
So Johto has comparative advantage.

00:05:05.724 --> 00:05:07.807
So Johto has comparative,

00:05:12.042 --> 00:05:14.792
comparative advantage in berries.

00:05:20.344 --> 00:05:22.268
And I apologize a little
bit for my penmanship,

00:05:22.268 --> 00:05:24.833
I'm trying to save time by
writing a little bit fast,

00:05:24.833 --> 00:05:26.816
but hopefully me saying it
out loud at the same time

00:05:26.816 --> 00:05:29.297
is making it somewhat legible.

00:05:29.297 --> 00:05:30.130
All right.

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.150
So the next question.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.086
If these countries were
to specialize in trade,

00:05:34.086 --> 00:05:37.149
who would produce which good, explain.

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:38.395
Well whoever have the
comparative advantage

00:05:38.395 --> 00:05:40.425
of each will produce that one.

00:05:40.425 --> 00:05:43.342
So Kalos has comparative advantage,

00:05:44.531 --> 00:05:47.531
Kalos has lower opportunity cost in,

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.127
in let's see, they have
the lower opportunity cost

00:05:54.127 --> 00:05:56.336
when you compare them to, oh let me see,

00:05:56.336 --> 00:05:57.373
let me put it this way.

00:05:57.373 --> 00:05:59.212
For charms, let me write I this way,

00:05:59.212 --> 00:06:03.296
Kalos has a lower
opportunity cost for charms.

00:06:03.296 --> 00:06:05.796
Kalos has advantage in charms.

00:06:10.952 --> 00:06:13.452
And then we already said Johto

00:06:15.281 --> 00:06:17.364
has advantage in berries.

00:06:21.055 --> 00:06:24.222
And so, Kalos, I keep saying it weird,

00:06:26.813 --> 00:06:28.646
Kalos produces charms,

00:06:34.208 --> 00:06:37.625
Johto produces berries, produces berries.

00:06:42.025 --> 00:06:43.211
And once again, this goes back

00:06:43.211 --> 00:06:45.188
to something we touched on at
the beginning of the video.

00:06:45.188 --> 00:06:48.135
Even though Johto has
the absolute advantage,

00:06:48.135 --> 00:06:51.016
in fact they have the
absolute advantage in either,

00:06:51.016 --> 00:06:52.600
Johto is not, even though they can produce

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.356
charms way more efficiently than Kalos,

00:06:55.356 --> 00:06:58.608
Johto is actually in this, if you buy

00:06:58.608 --> 00:07:00.797
all the arguments of
comparative advantages,

00:07:00.797 --> 00:07:03.024
Johto should actually produce the berries,

00:07:03.024 --> 00:07:05.343
while Kalos should produce the charms,

00:07:05.343 --> 00:07:07.217
because they have a lower opportunity cost

00:07:07.217 --> 00:07:08.923
in terms of berries.

00:07:08.923 --> 00:07:12.152
Now let's answer this last
question right over here.

00:07:12.152 --> 00:07:14.418
What would be a trading price that Johto

00:07:14.418 --> 00:07:18.671
and Kalos would agree
on to trade charms for?

00:07:18.671 --> 00:07:20.319
Now you might be saying,
well what's a price,

00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:21.685
I'm used to saying that in terms

00:07:21.685 --> 00:07:24.523
of just maybe dollars or
some type of currency,

00:07:24.523 --> 00:07:27.932
how do I answer a price right over here?

00:07:27.932 --> 00:07:30.168
Well, the key is that we can give a price

00:07:30.168 --> 00:07:32.611
in terms of opportunity cost.

00:07:32.611 --> 00:07:35.926
So they want a price of charms.

00:07:35.926 --> 00:07:39.121
So it really could be in terms of berries.

00:07:39.121 --> 00:07:39.995
So let's see.

00:07:39.995 --> 00:07:42.721
Let's look at each of
their cost of charms.

00:07:42.721 --> 00:07:46.553
So, Kalos' opportunity costs of a charm

00:07:46.553 --> 00:07:48.275
is two berries per charm,

00:07:48.275 --> 00:07:50.713
Johto's in three berries per charm.

00:07:50.713 --> 00:07:53.353
So let me rewrite that over here.

00:07:53.353 --> 00:07:56.853
So Kalos, Kalos opportunity cost of charms

00:08:02.994 --> 00:08:05.077
is two berries per charm.

00:08:10.115 --> 00:08:13.532
And then Johto opportunity cost of charms

00:08:16.702 --> 00:08:18.952
is three berries per charm.

00:08:20.978 --> 00:08:22.229
And here we're going to appreciate

00:08:22.229 --> 00:08:24.009
why comparative advantage works.

00:08:24.009 --> 00:08:27.072
We said that Kalos would be the one

00:08:27.072 --> 00:08:29.421
that would focus on the charms.

00:08:29.421 --> 00:08:30.254
And so notice.

00:08:30.254 --> 00:08:33.254
If they can sell the charms to Johto

00:08:34.615 --> 00:08:36.362
for something that is higher

00:08:36.362 --> 00:08:38.190
than their opportunity cost,

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:40.719
and lower than Johto's opportunity cost,

00:08:40.719 --> 00:08:42.335
then they both benefit.

00:08:42.335 --> 00:08:44.041
And so a good price, let's say you could

00:08:44.041 --> 00:08:45.403
go halfway between the two,

00:08:45.403 --> 00:08:47.322
but it really could be
anything in between the two,

00:08:47.322 --> 00:08:49.989
let's say 2.5 berries per charm.

00:08:54.653 --> 00:08:56.136
They both benefit.

00:08:56.136 --> 00:08:57.756
So they would trade at this,

00:08:57.756 --> 00:09:00.339
trade at 2.5 berries per charm.

00:09:01.677 --> 00:09:03.109
Why does this make sense for Johto,

00:09:03.109 --> 00:09:05.081
even though they have
the absolute advantage?

00:09:05.081 --> 00:09:08.852
Well if they produce nothing but charms,

00:09:08.852 --> 00:09:12.351
it would cost them, or
no matter what they do,

00:09:12.351 --> 00:09:14.595
it'll cost them three berries per charm.

00:09:14.595 --> 00:09:17.076
But now they figured out
a way, through trade,

00:09:17.076 --> 00:09:20.843
to get charms at two and
a half berries per charm.

00:09:20.843 --> 00:09:24.817
And so this will be a
better deal for Johto.

00:09:24.817 --> 00:09:26.533
And so one thing to appreciate

00:09:26.533 --> 00:09:28.025
when we talk about comparative advantage,

00:09:28.025 --> 00:09:29.260
some people think that it's about

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.491
one country benefiting
more than the other.

00:09:31.491 --> 00:09:32.935
But if we assume all of the assumptions

00:09:32.935 --> 00:09:36.027
about comparative advantage in our models,

00:09:36.027 --> 00:09:38.344
then it's actually about both countries

00:09:38.344 --> 00:09:39.795
that are trading benefit.

00:09:39.795 --> 00:09:41.162
They will both be better off.

00:09:41.162 --> 00:09:44.280
They will both get gains from trade,

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.613
and both will be better off.
