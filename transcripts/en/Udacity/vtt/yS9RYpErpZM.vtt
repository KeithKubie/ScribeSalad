00:00:00.041 --> 00:00:03.981
So in a moment,
we'll address how you estimate the value

00:00:03.981 --> 00:00:07.191
of that company that
generates $1 per year.

00:00:07.191 --> 00:00:09.466
In other words,
that dollar bill machine.

00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:11.156
Before we dig into that,

00:00:11.156 --> 00:00:17.130
let's spend a moment considering why does
it matter how much a company is worth?

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.777
This course is about buying and selling
stocks, so we're going to look at why

00:00:21.777 --> 00:00:25.856
company value matters with regard
to buying and selling stocks.

00:00:25.856 --> 00:00:30.607
Of course, we want to buy a stock
when the price is too low and

00:00:30.607 --> 00:00:33.661
we want to sell it when it's too high.

00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:39.331
In general, the value of
a company goes up monotonically.

00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:43.120
In other words,
it is always increasing over time.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.480
Let's assume for a moment,
this is the true value of that company.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.247
We'll address in a little bit what true
means, but let's assume for the moment

00:00:53.247 --> 00:00:57.964
that we have some understanding of the
underlying real value of that company.

00:00:57.964 --> 00:01:00.748
Now that true value is distinct and

00:01:00.748 --> 00:01:04.879
different from the value
estimated by the market.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.719
In other words, what price
the stock market says, it's worth?

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:13.637
So on one particular day, maybe
the price is higher than the true value.

00:01:13.637 --> 00:01:19.180
On some other day, maybe it's lower and
on some other day, it's the same.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.360
Very many trading strategies,
which is what this course is about,

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.630
focus on identifying
situations where the current

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.430
stock price is different
from the true value.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.773
So in other words,
if the stock price goes up a lot, but

00:01:36.773 --> 00:01:40.348
we know the actual company is
only worth a certain amount.

00:01:40.348 --> 00:01:44.136
When it goes up high,
that might be a selling opportunity.

00:01:44.136 --> 00:01:46.435
In other words,
if we see the price up here and

00:01:46.435 --> 00:01:50.280
we know the true value of
the company is down here, sell it.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.780
And similarly, if we see the price
really low compared to what the company

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.610
is worth, that could represent
a buying opportunity.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.530
There are many, many ways that we can
estimate the true value of a company.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.236
We're going to touch on a few
of them in this lesson.

00:02:07.236 --> 00:02:11.992
One is intrinsic value,
this is based on the value of

00:02:11.992 --> 00:02:16.325
the company as estimated
by future dividends.

00:02:16.325 --> 00:02:21.562
In other words,
companies pay many companies not all,

00:02:21.562 --> 00:02:25.470
pay each year or
each quarter a dividend.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.070
So it's a cash payment,
if you own a share of stock,

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.470
you get a certain amount of dividend.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.880
For instance, for Apple this year,
it's about $2 per year.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.130
So intrinsic value is based on,
if we own one share of stock, we're

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:47.020
going to get some amount of dividends
accumulated over all of the future.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.094
What's the value of
the company based on that?

00:02:50.094 --> 00:02:55.078
Another is book value, which is based
on the assets that the company owns.

00:02:55.078 --> 00:02:56.445
So in other words,

00:02:56.445 --> 00:03:00.895
we add up the value of all
the factories that they own and so on.

00:03:00.895 --> 00:03:02.393
Finally is market cap.

00:03:02.393 --> 00:03:06.205
This is based on the value of
the stock on the market and

00:03:06.205 --> 00:03:09.250
how many shares are outstanding.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.610
So in other words,

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.038
this relates to what is the market
think the company is worth?

00:03:15.038 --> 00:03:19.511
This relates to what's the value
of the sum of the assets?

00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:22.979
And this one relates to, well,
if I own a share of stock,

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:25.744
how much money am I going to
get over the future?

00:03:25.744 --> 00:03:29.160
And what's that worth overall
in the future going forward?
