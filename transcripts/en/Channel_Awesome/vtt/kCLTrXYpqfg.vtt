00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.360
Let's talk about "The Descendants!"

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.580
Ever since this idea was green-lit,

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.320
Everyone has been sending me links, and updates

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.100
about what an AWFUL idea this is.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.060
A Disney Channel movie about famous animated Disney villains...

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.940
...who have rowdy teenage kids that go to school!

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.680
Everyone's been going on and on about

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.760
just how stupid this is!

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.600
And..

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.780
..Yeah.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.640
It's pretty bad.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.680
Is it the worst of these Disney Channel movies I've seen?

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.200
No.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.500
Are there definitely times where there's

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.380
a lot of effort put in?

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.340
Absolutely!

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.940
But-

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.820
*laughs*

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.340
laughing* It's still pretty bad!

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.140
I mean-

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.380
What can you even do?

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.040
It just comes from an awful idea!

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.520
In a far-away land, Belle and the Beast rule all the..

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.120
fairy-tale kingdoms I guess?

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.600
And they merge them all together,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.000
but put all the Disney villians on this island

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.800
that's..actually a little bigger than the good kingdom..

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.800
(that's confusing..)

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.940
keeping them seperate.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.800
But Belle and the Beast's son, who's gonna be king soon,

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.080
has a BRAVE new idea that the offspring

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.860
of these villians should be allowed to go to their school.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.020
Treated like any other decent human being!

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.300
These kids include the son of Cruella Deville,

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.280
the son of Jafar,

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.680
the daughter of the Evil Queen,

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.140
and the daughter of Maleficient.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.400
And if you're excited to see the live-action version

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.760
of your favorite Disney villians,

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.540
*laughing* you shouldn't be!

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.280
These are treated like the Adam West Batman villians

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.320
if the last shroud if dignity was waterboarded out of them!

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.560
They're BARELY even recognisable

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.520
outside of their clothes

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.000
In fact, if you had them in completely different clothes

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.340
you probably won't even be able

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.100
to tell which villians they were!

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.080
Man, just when I thought they couldn't do Maleficient

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.340
worse than Angelina Jolie, we get this interpretation!

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.720
The Mistress of All Evil,

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.880
one of the greatest Disney villians EVER

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.680
is now a snorting, high-pitched, screaming,

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.580
bad-joke cracking twit!

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.160
And the others are not much better.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.140
But nevertheless, they see an opprotunity when their

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.720
kids are invited to go to school among the good people.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.980
And they convince them

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.880
to steal the ultimate weapon of power:

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.820
the magic wand from the fairy godmother who runs the school.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:12.320
But-

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.720
Wouldn't you know it?!

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.520
The longer they stay there, the more they realize

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.700
They might like being good!

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.340
Oh, so much conflict!

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.460
And maybe that's the biggest suprise about Descendants:

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.520
Is that there IS legit conflict.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.020
The kids all do a good job portaying what they're

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.160
supposed to portray.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.220
Honestly, every actor does!

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.400
I doubt they told Kathy Najimy to play the Evil Queen

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.360
as this dignified evil villian!

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.440
No, it's Kathy Najimy, you got her to be funny!

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.380
She, as well as all the other actors,

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.880
are giving exactly what's being asked for.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.960
It just so happens what's being asked for

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.480
is incredibly stupid!

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.360
Half the time, they really try to make

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.500
the Disney characters look like the Disney characters.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.600
You know that's Maleficient,

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.000
you know that's the Evil Queen,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.440
they have the stained glass window from Beauty and the Beast,

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.240
Even the title "Descendants"

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.740
has the "Disney D" in it!

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.360
But it so obviously doesn't go with what they're trying to do here!

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.220
There are scenes of the kids trying sweets

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.600
for the first time because they've never had chocolate,

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.320
or good fruit, or anything like that!

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.780
They start getting teary-eyed when they hear how other

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.360
parents treat their kids and compare it to their parents!

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.580
There's a downright uncomfortable moment when

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.140
the mother of Sleeping Beauty TOTALLY disregards

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.600
the daughter of Maleficient because she couldn't see

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.740
her daughter for 16 years!

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.580
And it's treated with all seriousness!

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.080
I-

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.660
*sighs* Okay, so we're gonna take this really seriously?

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.640
Maybe you should cut scenes like this!

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.180
Evil Queen: "It will help you find things."

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.340
Daughter: "Like a prince!"

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.160
Evil Queen: "Like my waistline."

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.160
Maleficient: "Like the magic wand, Hello?!"

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.660
Evil Queen: "Hello."

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.920
These things clearly don't go together!

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.200
And I have no idea how this was supposed to work!

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.580
The only possible way I can see this maybe working is

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.740
if you never actually see the villians.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.560
Like you see the kids, but the villians are always kept in shadow.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.320
And they're legitimately intimidating,

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.260
and scary,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.200
and like your imagination can fill in how threatening they are.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.060
But no!

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.520
They have song and dance numbers

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.580
right off of a cheesy Broadway show!

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.540
This is so clearly not the Maleficient from the original

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.860
movie, but it's not this other Maleficient you're trying

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.220
to create either that's like really intimidating

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.200
and destroyed a lot of lives and everything either!

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.940
She's a joke!

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:13.760
She's a punchline!

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.960
But the movie doesn't always treat it that way!

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.020
The song and dance numbers are similar.

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.200
At first, they're actually kind-of impressive.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.460
This is the guy who did the High School Musical films,

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.500
so, yeah. It's choreographed really nice,

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.420
The songs, at first, are kind-of catchy,

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.080
Heck, even the emotional ones are done relatively well!

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.400
Much better than Camp Rock or Cheetah Girls, I mean

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.340
I feel genuine emotion here!

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.080
But then-

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.200
you immediately take that point away when you hear

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.780
their R&amp;B version of "Be Our Guest"

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.840
"Tie your napkin 'round your neck, cheire,
And we'll provide the rest"

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.460
*laughing* Oh, my god,

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:46.160
Stop!

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.200
*crying/laughing* Stop, stop!

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.440
Like I said, it's kinda hard to blame the director, the actors,

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.920
'Cause it very much feels like they're just following orders

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.600
And they're doing it as best they can.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.900
But the order is a tone confused mess!

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:00.460
And just-

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.680
-Not a good idea!

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:02.380
Like-

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.380
-at all!

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.260
They talk about prejudice, and the sins of the parents,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.980
that shouldn't be passed down to the kids

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.060
and, yeah! That's something for older kids to get into.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.080
It's very relavent.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.220
But the idea is clearly meant for kindergardeners!

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.360
and half the time, that's how it's portratyed!

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.260
Except, when it's trying to be portrayed

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.080
as this really dramatic musical!

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.620
*sighs* yeah, so

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.100
It is really stupid, but I will give credit it's not..

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.980
..AS stupid as it could of been.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.600
Well-

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.300
-okay, VERY LARGE chunks are.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.020
But there's also a lot of really talented songwriters,

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.140
choreographers,

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.940
singers, dancers, actors...

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.460
It's the right people for the wrong project.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.980
It's hard to know who the audience is supposed to be,

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.200
but seeing how they made a sequel, I guess it did find

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.280
an audience and..

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.460
and they like it.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.300
Good for them.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.660
Like I said, there's really nothing wrong in it.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:51.580
It's just-

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.620
*laughing* -so stupid!

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.560
If this is the kind-of corny insanity that does it for you,

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.460
I'd by lying if I said I didn't almost understand.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.100
It is fascinating in its choices!

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.140
But if you're looking for a movie where all this talent

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:05.860
comes together in a coherent story,

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.420
then ya ain't gonna live happily ever after here.
