00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:07.189
One of the most acute questions we ask ourselves
in relation to new friends and acquaintances

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:13.400
is whether or not they like us. The question
feels so significant because, depending on

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.690
how we answer it in our minds, we will either
take steps to deepen the friendship or, as

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.500
is often the case, immediately make moves
to withdraw from it so as to spare ourselves

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.800
humiliation and embarrassment. But what is
striking and sad is how essentially passive

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:36.880
we are in relation to this enquiry. We assume
that there is a more or less binary answer,

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.230
that it is wholly in the remit of the other
person to settle it – and that there is

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.520
nothing much we could do to shift the verdict
one way or the other. Either someone wants

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.790
to be our friend – or they don’t – and
the answer, while it is about us, is essentially

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:59.420
disconnected from any of our own initiatives.
We are hereby failing to apply to other people

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:06.670
a basic lesson we can appreciate well enough
when we study the functioning of our own judgements:

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:13.880
we often don’t know what we think of other
people. Our moods hover and sway. There are

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.049
days when we can see the point of someone
and others when their positive sides elude

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:23.700
us entirely. But, and this is the key point,
what usually helps us to decide what someone

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.520
means to us is our sense of what we mean to
them.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.549
The possibility of friendship between people

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:36.639
therefore frequently hangs in the balance
because both sides are privately waiting for

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:42.020
a sign from the other one as to whether or
not they are liked – before they dare to

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.350
show (or even register) any enthusiasm of
their own. Both sides proceed under the tacit

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.350
assumption that there is some a priori verdict
about their value that the other person will

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.229
be developing in their mind which has no connection
to how they themselves behave and is impervious

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:06.249
to anything they say or do. Under pressure,
we forget the fundamental malleability within

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:12.390
the question of whether someone wants to be
friends with us or not. Most of it depends

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.540
on how we behave to them. If we have a little
courage and can keep our deep suspicions of

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.700
ourselves and our terror of their rejection
of us at bay, we have every opportunity to

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.690
turn the situation in our direction. We can
dare to persuade them to see us in a positive

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.040
light – chiefly by showing a great deal
of evidence that we see them in a positive

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.670
light. We can apply the full range of techniques
of charm: we can remember small things about

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.329
them, display an interest in what they have
been up to, laugh at their witty moments and

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:52.359
sympathise with them around their sorrows.
Though our instinct is to be close to superstitious

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:58.040
in our understanding of why people like us,
we have to be extremely unlucky to land on

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.480
people who genuinely show no interest in a
friendship with us once we have carried out

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.610
a full set of charming manoeuvres with any
level of sincerity and basic tact.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.969
Friendships cannot develop until one side

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:18.959
takes a risk of showing they are ready to
like even when there’s as yet no evidence

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.340
that they are liked back. We have to realise
that whether or not the other person likes

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:30.790
us is going to depend on what we do, not – mystically
– what we by nature ‘are’, and that

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.579
we have the agency to do rather a lot of things.
Even though we may initially get very few

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:41.700
signs of their interest (they might be looking
a little distracted and behaving in an off-hand

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.639
way), we should assume that this is only a
legacy of a restraint that springs from fear

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:52.090
that they are not able to please – and that
so long as we keep showing them warmth and

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:59.390
encouragement to appease their self-suspicion,
the barriers will eventually come down. It

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:05.200
is sad enough when two people dislike each
other. It is even sadder when two people fail

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.439
to connect because both parties defensively
but falsely guess that the other doesn’t

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:17.950
like them – and yet, out of low self-worth,
don’t take any risk whatever to alter the

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:25.280
situation. We should stop worrying quite so
much whether or not people like us, and do

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:33.050
that far more interesting and socially-useful
move: concentrate on showing that we like

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.600
them.
