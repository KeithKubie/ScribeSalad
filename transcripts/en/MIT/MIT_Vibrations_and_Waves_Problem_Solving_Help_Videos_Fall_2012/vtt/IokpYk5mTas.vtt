00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.090
PROFESSOR: Well, we're back.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.830
And today we will
consider solutions

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.950
to harmonic oscillators with
damped harmonic oscillators.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.420
And what I thought
would be best, in order

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.570
to focus on the new part,
the question of damping--

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.620
what effect it has on
the motion of harmonic

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.830
oscillators-- I decided I'll
take an oscillator, which

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.590
is one of those we
considered last time,

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.210
I could've taken
any one of them,

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.180
and add to it a drag force.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:04.200
So let me discuss what
we're going to consider.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.810
Suppose we have a rod,
the uniform rod of mass m

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.510
suspended from the pivot here.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.780
This is the vertical plane.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.140
So imagine a ruler, for
example, with a nail

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.880
through the end of
it can oscillate

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.070
in the plane of this board.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:33.680
So we at a gain considering
rotations in two dimensions.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.750
We will consider
rotations, which

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.960
are anti-clockwise, like
this, to have a positive sign.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.520
And if it's clockwise,
that's a negative rotation.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.310
This particular mass rod
we assume has a mass m.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.820
It's uniform length l.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.280
And initially, it's just
suspended like this.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.145
So at time equals 0.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.700
This is the position,
and at that instant,

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.650
we hit the bottom.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.830
There's an impulse acting on it.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.180
And that impulse instantaneously
gives an angular velocity

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.570
to this rod, which is of
course the rate of change

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.540
of the angle.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.660
And we assume it
has some number.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.930
And so that it's easy for you
to remember what that number is,

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.600
I'm calling it the angular
velocity at t equals 0.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.470
But remember, this is simply
the initial angular velocity

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.330
that this rod has.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.300
At any instant of
time later, this rod

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.430
will be at some other angle.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.000
I've shown here, theta of t.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.890
This is at time t.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.780
And it may be
moving at that time.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.330
And the angular velocity in this
direction we call theta dot t.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:07.330
These are anti-clockwise
rotations.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.740
And so these are positive.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.250
This is as that angle.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.480
And if this is a
positive number,

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.490
this is rotating
in that direction.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.910
So this is the same
simple harmonic oscillator

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.670
we considered last time.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.230
And what I now want to
take a slightly more

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.160
realistic situation.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.190
All harmonic oscillators
in the universe

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.770
have some drag,
maybe very small,

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.630
some mechanism by which
they lose kinetic energy.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:46.460
So we were going to assume
that this oscillator has

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.540
some drag torque applied to it.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.946
It could be friction around
the pivot, it could be the air,

00:03:52.946 --> 00:03:57.230
this could be inside
the liquid, you name it.

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.690
Now, I am going to
make the assumption

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:08.780
that the presence of
the damping mechanism

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:15.750
exerts a drag
torque on this rod.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.690
And I'm going to make the
assumption that the drag

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:26.080
force is proportional
to the angular velocity.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.670
Since the drag force is
in the opposite direction

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.980
to the angular
velocity obviously,

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.890
there is a minus
sign here and this

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.840
is the constant of
proportionality.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.490
Now, you may well ask why did
I assume this is the case?

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.830
Is that because in nature
it's normally like that?

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:44.870
No.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.860
The reason why I chose
this form is very simple.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:55.880
I know from experience that
if I use this drag force,

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.590
I can analytically
solve my equations.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.510
If I take a more realistic
version of the force,

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.170
then the final solutions
I'm going to get it

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.579
are not analytically soluble.

00:05:08.579 --> 00:05:10.120
It doesn't mean you
can't solve them.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.810
You can solve them
by a computer.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.950
But for teaching you
how to solve problems,

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.900
it's not going to be
very helpful if I then

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.000
say go into a computer
and get the computer

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.270
to solve it for you.

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.600
So the choice of
this resistive force

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:31.100
which is proportional to the
rate of change of position

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.550
of the rod is chosen
for that reason.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.820
The other thing I will do, once
again-- because of what you

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.040
saw last time that
happened-- assume

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.920
that the displacement
of this rod is small.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.600
We're only going to
consider small oscillations.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:58.210
In other words,
we'll only assume

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.340
it's sufficiently small so
that we can approximate sine

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.800
of the angle by
the angle itself.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.850
Again, the reason why we do
that is so that at the end,

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:14.840
we'll be able to solve
the equations of motion.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.690
Now, if you ask
yourself, hold on.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.090
We're doing all
these approximations.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.020
Does this correspond to reality?

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.030
And the answer is the following.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.070
In problems that we are
doing on the board like this,

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:35.760
we're taking
idealized situations.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.590
For those idealized
situations, the prediction

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.480
of what will happen is exact.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:49.090
But since the description
of the situations

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.300
is it not exactly equal
to what you'd normally

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.320
have in the world, the
answers that we get

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:01.970
are only as accurate to the
degree of the assumptions.

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:05.830
But certainly from
solutions like this,

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.080
we can get a sense
in understanding

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.670
what happens, because
for example, the drag

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:17.170
force slightly different
will not qualitatively

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:20.840
change what the actual
motion is, et cetera.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.530
And this happens throughout
so-called problem solving

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:30.830
land in any physics
that you consider.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:34.290
So this is the physical
description of the situation.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:37.290
And what we want
to do, as before,

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:43.350
find out what this rod
will do qualitatively

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.700
as a function of
time and also be

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.840
able to predict
exactly where it will

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.930
be at the given instant of time.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:56.760
So that's what I mean by I'm
going to solve this problem.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:01.310
Now, I chose the
same oscillator as I

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:07.040
say so that you don't have to
focus so much on the rising

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:14.430
equation of motion, but more
on what the frictional torque

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:20.450
does, how that changes
what we learned before.

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:26.240
So here is the free body
diagrams or the force

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:31.260
diagram, which
corresponds to this.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.710
Here is the pivot.

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:35.289
This represents the rod.

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:37.950
What forces act on this rod?

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:41.280
Well, there's going to
be the force of gravity.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.410
And you know from the
studies of rigid body motion

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:52.330
that we can understand what
torque this force exerts

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:55.000
by considering that
the force of gravity

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.110
acts at the center
of mass of this rod.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:00.050
So if you take the
center of mass,

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:03.400
this location, then
there'll be a force

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.060
of gravity on this mass.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:07.810
The mass of the rod
will be m, so there'll

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:11.530
be an mg force acting
downwards there.

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:19.810
This force applied to this
rigid body will exert a torque.

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:22.990
In this case, it'll be a
clockwise and negative torque.

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:29.390
In addition to
that, there will be

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:35.370
a torque acting on this due
to the frictional force.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:44.760
And that, we said, we
will call b theta dot.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:51.400
So what is the equation
of motion for this rod?

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:56.070
The acceleration of the
angular acceleration

00:09:56.070 --> 00:10:05.360
of this rod from tau
is equal to i alpha.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.590
The acceleration will be
equal to the torque divided

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:12.310
by the moment of inertia.

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:17.480
Since this is rotations of a
rigid body in a plane in two

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:22.820
dimensions, I don't have to
write any vector quantities.

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:28.950
On writing the equations,
this is the component

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:34.760
of the rotations about an axis
perpendicular to the board

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.230
here.

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:40.360
So the angular
acceleration will be

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.170
equal to the total torque,
which is the torque due

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:47.580
to gravity plus the torque
due to the drag divided

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.270
by the moment of inertia.

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:51.590
And by the way, the
moment of inertia

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:58.840
of a rod like this about
one end is 1/3 ml squared.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:06.010
So this is the torque
due to gravity on this.

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:08.670
It's minus because,
as I mentioned here,

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:14.390
it's a clockwise torque
minus b theta dot.

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:18.230
That's also minus that, because
the drag force is always

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:26.010
in opposition to the angular
velocity divided by i.

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:31.380
As we did last time for
the harmonic oscillator,

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:37.400
in order for me to write fewer
numbers or algebraic symbols

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.840
on the board, I define
some quantities.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:47.990
I will define omega 0 squared
to be equal to 3 g over l.

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:53.010
I'll define gamma
to be b over I--

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:55.820
that constant
proportionality divided

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:59.070
by the inertia of this
system, the moment of inertia.

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:04.180
And I will, as I said, assume
that this angle's always

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:09.930
sufficiently small for the
accuracy with which one

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:12.490
I want to predict
what will happen,

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:18.690
I can assume that sine
delta t is equal to theta t.

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:20.960
Now let me be honest with you.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.310
I defined these
quantities not only

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:27.840
to make my life easier
in writing things down,

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:33.670
but as you'll see as we go on,
it will serve a useful purpose

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:38.210
for comparing how all sorts
of harmonic oscillators

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:42.290
behave with or without
damping, et cetera.

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:45.480
If I take these definitions
and make this assumption

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:50.730
and I take this and play
around with the algebra,

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:53.490
I'll end up with this equation.

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:56.530
I end up with an equation
that theta double

00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:59.570
dot, the second derivative
of theta and the angular

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:04.600
acceleration times gamma times
the angular velocity plus omega

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:09.840
0 squared times the angular
position is equal to 0.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.700
This is the equation of
motion for this system.

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:15.900
And the other
thing which we know

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:21.670
that initially the
theta at 0 is 0

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:25.780
and the initial
angular velocity is

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:30.280
this number, angular
velocity at t equals 0.

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:41.200
These three equations
are absolutely,

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.340
from the point of
view of physics,

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:48.160
equivalent to the
description we had.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.310
Here we had this
physical description

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:55.465
of somebody's--
this rod, et cetera.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:05.803
These mathematical equations
describe this situation.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:15.179
In order to predict what will
happen, what we now have to do

00:14:15.179 --> 00:14:16.220
is solve these equations.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.090
So that's what I will do now.

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:24.865
So I will solve this equation.

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:36.390
And let me remind you, as
I discussed in the past,

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:40.450
I cannot emphasize
it enough now.

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:44.580
I am not trying to
teach you mathematics.

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:51.805
I am trying to help you learn
how to solve physical systems,

00:14:51.805 --> 00:14:57.340
how to predict how a
given physical system will

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:59.620
behave as a function of time.

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:05.280
So for me,
mathematics is a tool.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:08.020
I need a solution
of that equation.

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:11.860
And this is a linear
second order differential

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.350
equation in time.

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:31.410
And I know from mathematics
that if I find an equation which

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:38.320
solves that and if it has
2 arbitrary constants--

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:42.840
in other words, the
solution satisfies

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:46.260
that equation for all values
of those arbitrary constants.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:56.300
Then I have found the one and
only solution of that equation.

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:57.970
And so let me tell you.

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:08.760
I will solve this by using
this uniqueness theorem.

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:18.830
I know that that
equation, unfortunately,

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:22.170
is a little harder to
solve than the one we

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:25.650
did last time for
simple harmonic motion.

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:28.850
One finds that the
solution of that equation

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:39.700
actually depends
on these constants.

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:47.950
For the harmonic oscillator,
the type of equation,

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:51.620
which was the solution, did
not depend on those constants.

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:54.450
Here, it does.

00:16:54.450 --> 00:17:01.520
One finds that if you
have gamma squared greater

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:08.010
than omega 0 squared--
in other words,

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:12.780
if you have this big constant
bigger than a certain amount,

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:16.050
this means you
have heavy damping.

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:20.550
You have one kind of a solution,
while if it's that other way

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:24.849
about, if this is
bigger than that,

00:17:24.849 --> 00:17:28.560
you get a different
kind of a solution.

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:33.150
It's not obvious, but that's
what mathematics tells you.

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:38.050
So let me consider first
the case of strong damping.

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:40.500
B is big.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.600
And so we're talking
about situation,

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:46.370
you have this oscillator.

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:48.470
But there's lots
of friction, so it

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:52.680
doesn't move smoothly at all.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.680
This is greater than that.

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:57.790
Under those
conditions, you'll find

00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:08.350
that this equation satisfies
our equation of motion.

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:16.200
Now actually, Professor
Walter Lewin, in his lectures,

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:28.410
did show you how you can prove
that this equation satisfies

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:34.370
our equation of motion for
these specific conditions.

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:37.720
He used complex amplitude.

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:41.600
And you can review his
lectures and you can see that.

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:47.080
Or you can look it up in books
on the solution of differential

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.300
equations.

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.990
For me, it is
adequate that I found

00:18:51.990 --> 00:19:00.290
a solution which
satisfies this equation.

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:07.570
Now, note this is a
solution of that equation

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:14.570
where the alpha 1 and
alpha 2 are defined here.

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:17.710
It's all defined in
known quantities.

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:21.950
Gamma omega 0 are
known quantities

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:24.910
for any specific problem
in particular for the one

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:26.810
we're solving.

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:29.940
So here, every term is known.

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:34.210
The A and the B are the
2 arbitrary constants.

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:38.650
In other words, this equation
satisfies our equation

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:42.470
of motion for all
values of A and B.

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:45.110
So again, by the
uniqueness theorem,

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:49.090
this is the most general
solution to our problem

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:54.470
provided the damping
is very high.

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:59.140
If this is the theta
of t, then of course

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:04.090
the angular velocity theta dot
of t, just differentiate here.

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:07.940
And I get minus alpha 1 A
e to the minus alpha 1 t

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:11.940
and minus alpha 2 B
to the minus alpha t.

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:22.580
We want to find the solution
to our particular problem.

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:26.870
So we found it that
satisfies the equation

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:28.680
of motion for our system.

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:33.990
We now want to make sure
that we have a solution which

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:36.120
satisfies the
boundary conditions.

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:39.460
In other words, which
is consistent with what

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:43.480
we said this rod was
doing at t equals 0.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:48.930
At t equals 0, we said the rod
was vertically, so theta of 0

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:50.160
is 0.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.760
And we also said that
at that instance,

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:54.780
there was an impulse
given to the rod.

00:20:54.780 --> 00:21:00.740
And so its angular velocity
at t equals 0 was this number,

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:03.990
the angular velocity
at t equal 0.

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:12.210
So we must now make sure that
the A and B, these arbitrary

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:18.250
constants, are consistent
with these initial conditions.

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:20.290
And it's obvious
how you do that.

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:29.120
You take this equation and
I take what is theta at t

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:29.830
equals 0.

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:30.520
Well, it's 0.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:33.450
So that's 0 equals
to t equals 0.

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:38.160
This is one, so it's A, plus
when t equals 0, this is B.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:42.720
So it's A plus B. So we know
that A must be equal to minus

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:47.220
B. That's to
satisfy the boundary

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:51.040
conditions that the rod
was vertical at t equals 0.

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.880
How about the other
boundary condition?

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:58.130
We know that t equals 0, the
angular velocity theta dot

00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:02.730
is angular velocity
at t equals 0.

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:10.000
And so angular at t equals 0
must be equal to minus alpha 1

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.770
times A. And t
equals 0, this is 1.

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:20.470
So it's minus alpha 1 A. And
here, minus alpha 2 B. OK,

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:29.000
we now have 2 equations with 2
knowns, 2 algebraic equations.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.620
Therefore, we can
find A and B. In fact,

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:36.590
we found already that A is equal
to minus B from this equation.

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:39.580
And then replacing
B by minus A, we

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:50.140
find that A is angular velocity
t equals 0 and alpha t over 1.

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:52.320
So what do we find?

00:22:52.320 --> 00:23:00.070
We have found that the specific
solution to our equation

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:03.780
of motion which satisfies
these boundary conditions

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:16.834
is theta of t is equal A
e to the minus alpha 1 t.

00:23:16.834 --> 00:23:33.400
A is angular velocity
at t equals 0 into e

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:38.870
to the minus alpha 1 t.

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:45.447
And B is minus A. So it's
minus e to the minus alpha 2t.

00:23:50.950 --> 00:24:05.840
So we have solved that problem.

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:11.010
This equation
describes the motion

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:22.150
of this compound pendulum,
the rod, completely.

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:26.850
If you ask me for a
time, I will tell you

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:32.540
exactly the angle at which
this will be hanging.

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:36.200
There are no more
unknowns in this.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:44.050
Furthermore, it gives me a
sense of what that rod is doing.

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:47.770
And actually, it's
a bit of a surprise.

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:51.270
We've considered
here an oscillator,

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:54.320
we'd expect an
oscillator to oscillate.

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:56.780
This equation doesn't oscillate.

00:24:56.780 --> 00:25:00.210
It is the sum of 2
exponential functions.

00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:14.060
If I just qualitatively
plot this,

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:17.030
if you compare
alpha 2 to alpha 1,

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:20.720
you find that alpha 2
is greater than alpha 1.

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:30.380
So this exponential
has a bigger exponent.

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:32.960
It will be dropping
faster than this one.

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:34.010
So what do we have?

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:41.200
This is my angular velocity.

00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:49.395
Velocity at t equals 0.

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:53.630
Let's consider one of them.

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:57.100
This is 1.

00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:58.540
It's an exponential function.

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:03.910
Here, I'm plotting the
angle as a function of time.

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:12.070
I'll get some exponential
function like this,

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:14.130
starting at that value.

00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:18.350
And the other function's
also an exponential one,

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:21.770
which has a higher
value of the exponent.

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:24.810
And therefore, it'll
drop more quickly,

00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:27.860
starts with the same
amplitude, so it'll

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:30.300
go more quickly like this.

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:42.640
The net motion is the
difference between those 2.

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:46.620
Take this one minus that one.

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:49.040
What does that look like?

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:52.425
Well, qualitative you
can see I start at 0.

00:26:56.650 --> 00:27:00.620
Far out here, it'll be 0,
because the 2 exponentials

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:01.880
will approach 0.

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:06.430
So out here, and it'll
be 0 or approaching 0.

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:09.210
It'll be some magnitude in here.

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:16.880
And so I will get something
like this happening.

00:27:19.985 --> 00:27:22.110
It's the difference of the
2 exponential functions.

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.860
Isn't it amazing?

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:32.230
Let's think for a second
what we have shown.

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:37.920
We've taken this
harmonic oscillator,

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:43.850
we've put it in a situation
with a lot of friction,

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:53.880
we gave it a kick,
and we described it

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:58.090
in terms of these
mathematical equations.

00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:02.250
I then blindly
applied mathematics,

00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:06.342
solved these equations,
and predicted

00:28:06.342 --> 00:28:09.040
that this will be the motion.

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:11.790
No oscillations.

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:13.580
Let's stop now for a second.

00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:17.780
By common sense, what
would you expect?

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:19.940
Imagine you had this
rod and something which

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:26.600
is very, very viscous--
very high drag.

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:30.345
You give it a kick, it will
move, because of inertia it

00:28:30.345 --> 00:28:30.960
will move.

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.930
But it will get slowed down.

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:35.610
It will finally come to a halt.

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:39.890
And it'll slowly come back.

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:47.060
But if the resistive torque is
so big, it'll never overshoot.

00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:49.440
So this is exactly
what you'd expect.

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:57.920
And as I say, it is amazing.

00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:00.240
I always find it
amazing, because this

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:06.620
is a magnificent
example that mathematics

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:12.190
is the language that one can
use to describe the nature,

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:17.140
and that solving the
mathematical equations

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:21.110
predicts what will actually
happen in a given situation.

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.090
Enough philosophizing.

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:31.880
Let's now consider
the other possibility.

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:37.770
So I'll now do a
second problem where

00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:40.850
I will have very weak damping.

00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:43.810
So imagine a more
realistic situation.

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:47.490
We take our pendulum,
this compound pendulum,

00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:54.420
and we include the
resistive torque

00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:58.880
due to the air, for example,
that's there, et cetera.

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:03.070
Again, I am taking
the same pendulum

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:09.400
so that we just focus on
the effect of the damping.

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:14.273
So I think I have it here.

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:27.550
Everything up to here
will be exactly the same.

00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:29.980
The only thing
we've now changed,

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:39.720
we've said that this little b is
big such that the gamma squared

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:45.030
is smaller, it doesn't
have to be much smaller,

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:48.250
so that gamma squared is
less than 4 omega squared.

00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:51.840
In other words, B
is less than this.

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:56.090
So it's the weak damping case.

00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:59.670
You may well ask, hold on.

00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:02.450
Why look for any
other solutions?

00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:08.700
I have found a solution
for this equation before.

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:11.850
And up there was the
two exponentials.

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:15.150
Why can't we just take
those and say look,

00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:22.970
that equation satisfies this
equation, that value of theta,

00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:25.460
and just repeat this?

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:28.650
Well, try it and you'll
see you immediately get

00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:29.980
into difficulties.

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:35.800
In this formulation, you
see that alpha 1 and alpha 2

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:41.390
include a square root of gamma
squared minus 4 omega squared.

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:44.580
We had no problem with
that when gamma squared was

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:49.970
greater than 4 omega squared
and take the square root of it.

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:54.580
But if gamma squared is
less than 4 omega squared,

00:31:54.580 --> 00:32:00.810
that square root is the
square root of a minus number.

00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:06.390
And how is that going to
represent a physical situation?

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:10.170
So the method breaks down.

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:13.760
In other words,
for this case, we

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:19.640
had not found an
equation which satisfies

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:24.320
our equation of motion with
these boundary conditions.

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.790
So we've got to try again.

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:29.519
And there is an
equation that does.

00:32:29.519 --> 00:32:30.560
And I've written it here.

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:40.030
One finds that
theta of t is equal

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:44.500
to some arbitrary
constant A e to the minus

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:50.510
gamma over 2t times cosine,
omega prime t plus phi

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:54.632
where omega prime is well
defined in terms of omega 0

00:32:54.632 --> 00:32:57.480
and gamma is given here.

00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:00.630
And there's no problem.

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:03.860
We have now gamma squared
is less than that,

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:05.200
so this is a real number.

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:10.250
So it's no problem with
that square root plus phi.

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:14.650
So we have 2
arbitrary constants.

00:33:14.650 --> 00:33:15.840
Try it.

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:23.020
Take this equation,
differentiate it twice,

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:24.450
and calculate it.

00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:28.700
Then differentiate it once
and multiply it by gamma.

00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:29.610
Don't differentiate.

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:34.220
Take that equation and
multiply the omega 0 squared.

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:37.780
Add those 3 terms, you'll get 0.

00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:39.460
I tried it last
night to make sure I

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:42.330
didn't write the
wrong thing here.

00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:44.730
So that really works.

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:51.890
Again, if you want to know
how did I find this equation,

00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:54.630
did I take it out of a hat,
like a rabbit out of a hat?

00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:55.650
No.

00:33:55.650 --> 00:33:58.660
You can look it up in books,
solutions of equations,

00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:01.840
or actually Professor
Walter Lewin

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:07.160
did derive this solution also
using complex amplitudes.

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:08.909
And you can find
it in his lectures.

00:34:08.909 --> 00:34:12.469
But from my point of view, I
don't care where I got it from.

00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:15.270
That works.

00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:22.170
So this must
describe the motion.

00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:28.120
And it has 2 arbitrary
constants which

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:33.880
I can find out, because I
know the initial conditions

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:36.860
for this pendulum.

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:45.000
So once again, now I will try to
find the 2 arbitrary constants.

00:34:55.989 --> 00:34:57.540
How did we do it before?

00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:03.710
By taking our solution.

00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:10.165
Well, we know that
theta of 0 is 0.

00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:23.310
Therefore, if 0 is equal to A
e to the minus gamma over 2t,

00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:24.370
that's t 0.

00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:31.500
So that's 1 cosine
t 0, so I get phi.

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:42.740
So one boundary condition
tells me that phi is pi over 2.

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:46.170
Or there are others, minus
pi over 2 works, et cetera.

00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:47.430
Doesn't matter.

00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:54.120
Take any one of them and
providing you're consistent,

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:58.090
the other one will make up for
it to give you the same answer.

00:35:58.090 --> 00:36:01.590
So anything that satisfies
this boundary condition

00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:05.370
is fine for one of
those constants.

00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:07.810
Now, the other one
tells me something

00:36:07.810 --> 00:36:12.490
about the initial angular
velocity of the rod.

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:16.930
So I need to calculate the
angular velocity of this rod.

00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:23.530
So here, I calculate
theta dot t at time t

00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:25.930
by differentiating theta.

00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:28.520
And I get this lower equation.

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:35.110
And now again,
theta dot at 0 time

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:39.640
is equal to-- we know
it is-- this number,

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:43.760
angular velocity at t equals 0.

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:47.470
So in this equation,
I plug that in.

00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:51.600
I get that the
angular velocity at t

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:56.090
equals 0 will have to equal 2.

00:36:56.090 --> 00:37:02.710
A, e to the minus gamma over 2t.

00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:05.780
t is 0, so that's 1.

00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:17.710
And 2 minus omega prime sine
of omega prime t, but t is 0.

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:18.760
So that's 0.

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:23.010
Phi, that's the sine of pi
over 2, because we find phi.

00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:24.850
That's 1.

00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:27.530
So I don't do
anything with that.

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:34.210
Minus gamma over 2 cosine
of omega prime t. t is 0,

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:36.220
so it's cosine of phi.

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:40.230
Phi is pi over 2, so that is 0.

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:42.810
So that's all right.

00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:54.950
Therefore, A is
equal to now angular

00:37:54.950 --> 00:38:02.580
velocity at t equals 0
divided by omega prime.

00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:12.640
And therefore now,
let me move over here.

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:16.430
So now I can write
the full solution.

00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:18.950
I have found
everything, and I find

00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:23.570
that theta of t
from the second line

00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:32.300
down is equal to
A, which we found,

00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:41.470
angular velocity t equals
0 over omega prime minus--

00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:46.790
there's a minus-- and now
it's cosine omega prime t

00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:48.980
plus 90 degrees.

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:58.640
So that's the same as minus
sine of omega prime t.

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:02.680
The 2 minuses cancel,
so I get a plus.

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:09.000
And if earlier on you chose, for
example here, minus pi over 2,

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.960
then both of those signs
would have been plus,

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:14.050
and you still get
the same answer.

00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:15.780
So it doesn't matter.

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:19.060
The algebra looks after itself.

00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:31.800
So we have to found the solution
of this equation of motion

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:36.460
with these boundary
conditions for this situation

00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:38.990
where the gamma and
the omega 0 squared

00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:42.260
is such that this is
angle to correspond

00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:45.480
to the low damping situation.

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:47.195
What kind of a motion is that?

00:39:51.550 --> 00:40:06.710
If I plot this, again as we
do as a function of time,

00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:11.550
if I had a room full of students
here who would correct me, then

00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:14.350
I would have caught the mistake.

00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:16.700
If you look at the
second equation,

00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:20.140
it says take theta of t
is A e to the minus gamma

00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:23.500
2t cosine omega prime t.

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:26.855
When I rewrote it plugging
in the value of A,

00:40:26.855 --> 00:40:32.603
I forgot the e to the
minus gamma over 2t.

00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:38.800
Sorry about that.

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.190
And we continue.

00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:43.140
So now if I plot
this, what do I see?

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:47.510
If it wasn't for the e to
the minus gamma over 2t,

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:50.760
it would be a sine.

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:53.110
That's what it would look like.

00:40:53.110 --> 00:40:58.490
t, and this is the
angle theta of t.

00:40:58.490 --> 00:41:01.200
This would be the
simple harmonic motion

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:07.880
with no drag, no damping.

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:13.250
But this function is
multiplied by an exponential,

00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:16.210
like this, which is dropping.

00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:22.360
So the net result-- and
excuse my sloppy drawing--

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:25.770
is this modulated by that.

00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:29.970
So it will be
something like this.

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:37.830
So what we get is damped
harmonic oscillation.

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:49.860
Now again, I can't
resist pointing out.

00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:52.900
To me, it seems
almost miraculous.

00:41:52.900 --> 00:42:01.290
You have the same equation in
form with the same boundary

00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:09.840
conditions predicting
completely different behavior

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:14.690
if some of these constants are
bigger than the others or vice

00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:15.190
versa.

00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:25.680
So the mathematics has it built
in to that kind of solution.

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:27.740
Those two kinds of
solutions exist.

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:31.310
And that corresponds
exactly what

00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:36.180
you would expect if you imagine
an oscillator with damping.

00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:40.670
If you have this oscillator,
if it's highly damped, as I've

00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:45.360
said before, you would expect
this crazy motion reaching

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:49.310
a maximum slowly coming down
and coming to a grinding halt.

00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:51.830
Or if it's lightly
damped, you would

00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:56.490
expect this to almost behave
like a normal harmonic

00:42:56.490 --> 00:43:00.080
oscillator, but
slowly losing energy

00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:02.750
due to damping and
oscillating with smaller

00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:05.490
and smaller amplitude,
which is exactly

00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:07.240
what the mathematics
said would happen.

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:12.420
I always like to ask
a crazy question,

00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:16.975
how does the oscillator know
what the mathematical solution

00:43:16.975 --> 00:43:17.800
is?

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:19.770
But somehow or other, it does.

00:43:19.770 --> 00:43:24.302
It's a crazy way to phrase it,
but I always think of that.

00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:41.120
So let's put together
actually what

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:50.730
we have seen in combination
of last time and this time,

00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:56.700
my problem solving, my
attempts to teach you

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:59.610
how to solve problems.

00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:05.000
What we found last
time was that we

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.770
took three different
harmonic oscillators.

00:44:08.770 --> 00:44:11.790
One was a mass on a spring.

00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:18.020
Another was this rod
oscillating like this.

00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:22.950
The third was an electrical
system, an LC circuit.

00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:30.030
In each case, we found that
we the equation of motion

00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:32.200
looked exactly the same.

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:40.780
The only difference was what
was the name of the variable.

00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:46.180
For example, in the
case of the spring,

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:51.120
the displacement from the
equilibrium was a distance.

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:58.350
So this equation was of this
form where the size was y.

00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:07.060
When we came to this
oscillating rod,

00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:11.690
the quantity which was displaced
from equilibrium was an angle.

00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:15.310
So this sine was a theta.

00:45:15.310 --> 00:45:21.760
In the case of the LC circuit,
the quantity was a charge.

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:27.090
So the charge which was
displaced from equilibrium.

00:45:27.090 --> 00:45:31.570
But I could have summarized
the equations of motion

00:45:31.570 --> 00:45:34.240
for the three
harmonic oscillators

00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:37.530
by this one equation and
just tell you, well, this

00:45:37.530 --> 00:45:41.190
is the equation
of motion for that

00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:44.540
and put in the appropriate
quantity, which

00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:49.510
is displaced and also put
in the appropriate value

00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:53.310
of this constant, which for
the spring was k over n.

00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:55.400
For the rod, 3g over 2l.

00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:59.510
For the LC circuit is 1 over LC.

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:02.520
And believe me, we could
have taken a million harmonic

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:08.670
oscillator with no damping,
anyone you can think of,

00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:10.770
and I could reduce
it to this form.

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:17.850
So here's something
new that we observe,

00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:22.850
that you can take lots
of physical situation

00:46:22.850 --> 00:46:26.100
but describe them in terms
of the same mathematical

00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:27.460
equations.

00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:29.980
The same mathematical
equation can

00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:34.120
describe millions and
millions of different kinds

00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:36.020
of harmonic oscillators.

00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:39.180
So that is another feature
of the scientific method

00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:40.520
that is very important.

00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:45.410
It means now we don't
have to understand

00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:48.510
every little thing that
happens in the universe.

00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:55.410
We can reduce it to a smaller
subset of description.

00:46:58.430 --> 00:47:03.670
Now, we've now add
the new feature today.

00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:07.900
We added some loss mechanism.

00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:13.450
We took a specific kind
where the resistive force

00:47:13.450 --> 00:47:21.370
or the resist torque is
proportional to the velocity

00:47:21.370 --> 00:47:24.030
of the analysis.

00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:29.530
In our case, to the angular
velocity of the rod.

00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:33.070
And we derived an
equation of motion,

00:47:33.070 --> 00:47:40.100
which looks like this, where
these psis for the oscillator

00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:44.220
we considered was the
angular displacement.

00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:48.960
I don't have to be an Einstein--
by analogies to what I said

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:52.330
here-- to say look,
I could have taken

00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:57.220
any one of the oscillators
in the universe.

00:47:57.220 --> 00:48:03.510
And with damping,
if the damping is

00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:07.150
proportional to the
velocity of the analogous

00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:09.160
quantity of
velocity, I'll end up

00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:10.940
with this equation of motion.

00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:13.180
So this is the
equation of motion

00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:15.060
of simple harmonic motion.

00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:20.240
This is the equation of motion
of damped harmonic oscillators.

00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:21.090
Every one of them.

00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:28.850
But there is an interesting
difference we saw today.

00:48:28.850 --> 00:48:34.770
There is only qualitatively
one kind of solution here.

00:48:34.770 --> 00:48:38.700
In the case of the damped
harmonic oscillator,

00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:47.080
there are two qualitatively
different solutions to that.

00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:51.520
One is the sum of
exponentials and the other

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:54.580
is damped harmonic motion.

00:48:57.420 --> 00:49:04.330
Both the quality of the
solution and the details,

00:49:04.330 --> 00:49:07.760
whether it's oscillating
fast or slow, et cetera,

00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:11.080
depends on those
quantities-- the gamma

00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:14.870
and the omega 0 squared,
which in turn, for example,

00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:17.890
in the various cases it's
k over n, 3g, et cetera.

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:27.440
So that will describe
all oscillators.

00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:30.220
And in any particular
oscillator,

00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:34.070
if you want to know what
exactly happens at the given

00:49:34.070 --> 00:49:36.570
instant of time,
you then need also

00:49:36.570 --> 00:49:41.900
to know those two constants,
the boundary condition.

00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:45.400
If I have some mass on
the spring oscillating,

00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:48.570
where it will be
at some later time

00:49:48.570 --> 00:49:52.580
does depend where it is
at this very instant.

00:49:55.790 --> 00:49:59.052
Finally, there's just one more
thing I would like to do today,

00:49:59.052 --> 00:50:00.010
and it's the following.

00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:07.680
Oscillators are not
only nice in order

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:10.830
to give you a lecture
on oscillators

00:50:10.830 --> 00:50:13.740
or show you how to solve them,
they are practical devices.

00:50:16.290 --> 00:50:22.860
So sometimes we want to know
some property of a given

00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:24.200
oscillator.

00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:29.510
Well, there are two
properties which

00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:33.390
describe the quality
of a given oscillator

00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:37.010
and what its behavior is.

00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:41.571
One you've seen already is to
do the period or the frequency

00:50:41.571 --> 00:50:42.320
of the oscillator.

00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:45.880
In other words, you
could have one oscillator

00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:48.340
which goes very slowly.

00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:52.510
You're going to have one
which goes very fast.

00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:55.450
I have an oscillator
and you want

00:50:55.450 --> 00:50:59.840
to tell somebody what it's
like, a crucial number is what

00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:04.550
its period is, the 1 over the
period which is the frequency.

00:51:04.550 --> 00:51:07.810
Imagine, for example, a bell.

00:51:07.810 --> 00:51:09.960
That's an oscillator.

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:15.590
You could have a bell which has
a low tone or a very small one

00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:18.390
with a very high pitched tone.

00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:20.590
So that's one number
that's important.

00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:23.580
But there is another
number that's important.

00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:28.250
Whether it's a good
or a bad oscillator.

00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:34.040
And it's obvious what
is it good oscillator.

00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:38.020
A good oscillator is one that
oscillates for a long time.

00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:49.010
A bad one is that
doesn't continue

00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:52.340
oscillating for
a very long time.

00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:56.370
But again, you'd I'm
sure agree with me

00:51:56.370 --> 00:52:03.010
that it isn't just how many
oscillations it does, say,

00:52:03.010 --> 00:52:06.260
in a given time, like 1 second.

00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:09.000
If I take an
oscillator that makes

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:16.316
one oscillation per second,
then if it survives 1 second,

00:52:16.316 --> 00:52:18.190
you wouldn't say it's
a very good oscillator.

00:52:18.190 --> 00:52:24.040
It barely made one turn, while
if the oscillator is making

00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:26.850
a million oscillations
per second

00:52:26.850 --> 00:52:28.710
and that survives
for a second, you

00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:30.460
would say that's a
pretty good oscillator.

00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:39.410
It made a million oscillations
before it ran out of steam.

00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:46.140
So to quantify the quality of
an oscillator, we use a term,

00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:48.462
and being very
imaginative we call

00:52:48.462 --> 00:52:52.290
it the quality of the
oscillator, or Q value.

00:52:52.290 --> 00:52:57.050
So I will finally
want to derive for you

00:52:57.050 --> 00:53:02.910
for this particular oscillator
what is its Q or Q value.

00:53:02.910 --> 00:53:06.480
And that's the last
thing I will do today.

00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:15.520
Now, it only makes sense to talk
about the Q of an oscillator

00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:19.080
if it's at least a
reasonably good oscillator.

00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:22.470
This one, this overdamped
one who didn't even

00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:26.250
make one complete cycle,
it doesn't make sense

00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:29.490
to talk about its
Q. So the only case

00:53:29.490 --> 00:53:33.940
where it makes sense to talk
about the Q of an oscillator

00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:38.050
is if it makes at least
a few oscillations.

00:53:38.050 --> 00:53:41.440
It's got to be the
underdamped case.

00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:45.190
So I will now
calculate for you what

00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:51.120
is the Q of this compound
pendulum, this rod which

00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:57.230
oscillates on the conditions
where the drag force is small

00:53:57.230 --> 00:54:03.500
so that it has this
undamped motion.

00:54:13.090 --> 00:54:17.770
So let me do that.

00:54:17.770 --> 00:54:26.940
The Q value of an
oscillator is defined

00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:40.950
by no good reason of pi multiply
by the number of oscillations

00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:49.010
the oscillator makes before its
amplitude drops by 1 over e.

00:54:49.010 --> 00:54:51.710
It's a formal definition.

00:54:51.710 --> 00:54:58.655
So take some oscillator,
which is a good oscillator.

00:54:58.655 --> 00:55:00.990
So it oscillates like this.

00:55:00.990 --> 00:55:04.370
It's decaying.

00:55:04.370 --> 00:55:06.880
This has an
exponential form, as we

00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:10.270
saw for a damped
harmonic oscillator.

00:55:10.270 --> 00:55:13.760
And we ask the question
how many oscillations

00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:18.380
it makes before the
amplitude drops by 1 over e.

00:55:21.310 --> 00:55:24.700
And for historic
reason, 1 takes pi

00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:38.130
multiply by the number of
oscillations for amplitude

00:55:38.130 --> 00:55:42.480
to go down by amplitude over e.

00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:45.300
1 over e.

00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:49.000
Because the energy
stored in an oscillator

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:52.400
is proportional to
the amplitude squared,

00:55:52.400 --> 00:56:01.610
this is equivalent to 2 pi
times the number of oscillations

00:56:01.610 --> 00:56:11.830
it takes for the energy to
go to the energy over e.

00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:18.910
These are equivalent because
1 is the square of the other.

00:56:18.910 --> 00:56:20.770
And in fact, just
let me tell you.

00:56:20.770 --> 00:56:22.830
I'm digressing here.

00:56:22.830 --> 00:56:26.310
Originally this
was the definition.

00:56:26.310 --> 00:56:33.040
The 2 pi is there because
in the definition,

00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:38.870
one said what will be
the change of phase

00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:44.280
of the oscillator for the
energy stored in the oscillator

00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:46.420
to go down by 1 over e?

00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:49.000
If you're talking about
the change of phase

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:52.100
rather than number
of oscillations,

00:56:52.100 --> 00:56:55.420
you have 2 pi there,
because the phase

00:56:55.420 --> 00:56:59.820
in one oscillation, the
phase changes by 2 pi.

00:56:59.820 --> 00:57:02.000
So historically, this came in.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.315
That's equivalent to this.

00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:13.550
And so we have to
calculate that.

00:57:13.550 --> 00:57:17.260
Now, for this
particular oscillator,

00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:23.790
we actually calculated the
motion, how the angle changes

00:57:23.790 --> 00:57:28.260
with time, and we see
that the amplitude drops

00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:32.780
like e to the
minus gamma over 2.

00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:35.010
So we saw that the
amplitude drops

00:57:35.010 --> 00:57:40.413
like e to the minus
gamma over 2t.

00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:52.350
So in what time will the
amplitude drop by 1 over e?

00:57:52.350 --> 00:58:01.350
That time will be when gamma
t over 2 is equal to 1.

00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:07.040
So you get e to the minus 1.

00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:19.600
So it will be in a time
t equal to 2 over gamma.

00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:30.210
Now, what we are
interested in is how many

00:58:30.210 --> 00:58:38.620
oscillations will, in this
time, the oscillator make.

00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:55.860
But you know the period T is
equal to 2 pi over omega prime.

00:58:55.860 --> 00:59:05.640
I'm using here omega prime
because that is the angular

00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:09.190
frequency of the
damped oscillator.

00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:12.710
It was not omega 0,
like the undamped one.

00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:19.140
And omega prime I
defined for you earlier.

00:59:19.140 --> 00:59:26.810
But you know that if
the damping is weak,

00:59:26.810 --> 00:59:33.726
omega prime is essentially
equal to omega 0.

00:59:33.726 --> 00:59:35.340
Q is a quality thing.

00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:37.310
We don't need it exactly.

00:59:37.310 --> 00:59:41.540
So it's just to give you
a feel whether something

00:59:41.540 --> 00:59:43.960
is good or bad oscillator.

00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:49.280
So since omega prime is
essentially equal to omega 0,

00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:52.300
I'll take the period
to be approximately

00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:54.370
equal to this over omega 0.

00:59:58.440 --> 01:00:06.860
So in time t, how many
periods will I have?

01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:12.900
I have to divide
t by the period.

01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:16.810
That'll be the number of
oscillations I'll make.

01:00:16.810 --> 01:00:24.080
So it's 2 over gamma divided
by 2 pi over omega 0.

01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:33.640
And so this is the
number of oscillations.

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:38.580
So the Q will be pi times
the number of oscillations

01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:41.740
for the amplitude
to drop by this.

01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:48.230
So the Q will be
equal to pi times

01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:54.450
this quantity, which
is 2 over gamma divided

01:00:54.450 --> 01:01:02.570
by 2 pi over omega 0, which is
equal to omega 0 over gamma.

01:01:02.570 --> 01:01:08.270
So the quality of this
particular oscillator

01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:11.770
will be equal to
omega 0 over gamma.

01:01:11.770 --> 01:01:17.270
And I hope I still have it.

01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:18.150
Do I have that?

01:01:20.850 --> 01:01:31.710
Well, by going back
through this video,

01:01:31.710 --> 01:01:37.680
omega 0 we defined
earlier on and gamma also.

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:40.520
And so you calculated this.

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:44.000
That's as much as
I was going to do

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.330
about damped
oscillations for you.

01:01:47.330 --> 01:01:48.880
Thank you.
