00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.580
 Here I have a function h of n, 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.880
 and she clearly sets the members of an arithmetic progression. 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.980
 Let's make a quick table here. 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.600
 We have n and then we have h of n. 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.420
 When n equals 1, h of n is minus 31, 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.420
 minus 7 by 1 minus 1, which is zero. 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.240
 This will be just 0, 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.440
 so we will have minus 31. 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.640
 When n equals 2, we will have minus 31 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.054
 minus 7 by 2 minus 1, 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.960
 2 minus 1 is just 1, 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.240
 so we have minus 31 minus 7, 

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:45.994
 which is equal to minus 38. 

00:00:45.994 --> 00:00:47.662
 When n equals 3, 

00:00:47.662 --> 00:00:51.296
 we will have minus 31 minus 7 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.880
 3 minus 1, which is 2, 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.980
 so we'll pull out seven times. 

00:00:56.988 --> 00:01:00.467
 We will have minus 31 minus 14, 

00:01:00.467 --> 00:01:03.323
 which is equal to minus 45. 

00:01:03.323 --> 00:01:05.678
 What do we see happening here? 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.060
 We start from minus 31 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.940
 and then proceed by subtracting minus 7. 

00:01:12.947 --> 00:01:15.907
 We continue by subtracting minus 7 of this. 

00:01:15.907 --> 00:01:19.561
 We subtract minus 7 by one time less than the member's number ... 

00:01:19.561 --> 00:01:22.026
 We subtract minus 7 by one less time 

00:01:22.026 --> 00:01:23.198
 from the number of the member we have. 

00:01:23.198 --> 00:01:24.556
 If we look at the third article, 

00:01:24.556 --> 00:01:26.576
 we subtract minus 7 twice. 

00:01:26.576 --> 00:01:28.074
 If we look at the second article, 

00:01:28.074 --> 00:01:30.274
 subtract minus 7 once. 

00:01:30.274 --> 00:01:31.498
 All this is nice, 

00:01:31.498 --> 00:01:33.437
 and now pause the video 

00:01:33.437 --> 00:01:36.223
 and see if you can determine the same arithmetic progression. 

00:01:36.223 --> 00:01:38.777
 The progression here starts from minus 31 

00:01:38.777 --> 00:01:40.658
 and keep it going by taking 7, 

00:01:40.658 --> 00:01:43.943
 so we have minus 38 minus 45. 

00:01:43.943 --> 00:01:47.050
 The next one will be minus 52 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.210
 and keep going the same way. 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.311
 Continue to subtract minus 7. 

00:01:50.311 --> 00:01:52.830
 Can you determine this arithmetic progression 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.321
 by recursively assigning the function? 

00:01:55.321 --> 00:01:56.872
 Why do not you try to do it? 

00:01:57.512 --> 00:01:59.761
 Write the function using a recursive formula. 

00:01:59.761 --> 00:02:02.520
 Let's just call it g of n, 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.180
 In some respects, the recurrent formula of the function is easier, 

00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:06.297
 because you can say ... 

00:02:06.297 --> 00:02:08.619
 The first article, when n equals 1, 

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.960
 if n equals 1, let me write it, 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.060
 if n equals 1, 

00:02:16.067 --> 00:02:17.680
 how much will be g from n? 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.568
 Will be minus 31, 

00:02:19.568 --> 00:02:21.340
 minus 31. 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.380
 And if n is greater than 1 and is a natural number, 

00:02:26.387 --> 00:02:28.883
 this will be determined for all positive integer numbers 

00:02:28.883 --> 00:02:32.441
 and the natural numbers, 

00:02:32.441 --> 00:02:34.989
 we will have the previous member, 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.300
 namely g of n minus 1, 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.940
 minus 7. 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.760
 If we simply choose an arbitrary member, 

00:02:44.764 --> 00:02:46.285
 we must look at the previous article 

00:02:46.285 --> 00:02:49.628
 and then pull out 7. 

00:02:49.628 --> 00:02:51.764
 All this becomes nice and easy, 

00:02:51.764 --> 00:02:52.763
 because you keep looking 

00:02:52.763 --> 00:02:54.051
 the previous Articles, 

00:02:54.051 --> 00:02:56.652
 until you get to the base case, 

00:02:56.652 --> 00:02:58.103
 which is at n equal to 1, 

00:02:58.103 --> 00:02:59.984
 as you can build them back from it. 

00:02:59.984 --> 00:03:02.886
 And you get exactly the same arithmetic progression. 

00:03:02.886 --> 00:03:03.989
 Let's look at another example, 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.742
 but this time we will do it the opposite way. 

00:03:05.742 --> 00:03:08.645
 Here we have an arithmetic progression, 

00:03:08.645 --> 00:03:10.722
 defined by recurrent members 

00:03:10.722 --> 00:03:12.382
 and I want to create a feature, 

00:03:12.382 --> 00:03:15.132
 which determines progression apparently. 

00:03:15.132 --> 00:03:16.781
 Let's think about it. 

00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:19.300
 One way to look at this arithmetic progression, 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.679
 when n equals 1, it starts at 9.6 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.320
 and then each member is the previous minus 0.1. 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.576
 The second member will be the previous member 

00:03:30.576 --> 00:03:33.963
 minus 0.1, so it will be 9.5. 

00:03:33.963 --> 00:03:35.928
 Then you will go to 9.4. 

00:03:35.928 --> 00:03:37.752
 Then you will have 9.3. 

00:03:37.752 --> 00:03:40.326
 We can go on and on, and more. 

00:03:40.326 --> 00:03:42.794
 If we want, we can make a small table here 

00:03:43.524 --> 00:03:45.503
 and we could say, 

00:03:45.503 --> 00:03:48.823
 that this is n, it is h of n, 

00:03:48.823 --> 00:03:50.727
 when you see that when n equals 1, 

00:03:50.727 --> 00:03:52.864
 h of n is 9.6. 

00:03:52.864 --> 00:03:54.105
 When n equals 2, 

00:03:54.105 --> 00:03:55.382
 now we are here in this case, 

00:03:55.382 --> 00:03:57.402
 we will have h of 2 minus 1, 

00:03:57.402 --> 00:04:01.687
 which will be h of 1 minus 0.1. 

00:04:02.357 --> 00:04:04.542
 We will have just that minus 0.1, 

00:04:04.542 --> 00:04:07.862
 which will be 9.5. 

00:04:07.862 --> 00:04:11.953
 When h is 3, we will have h of 2, 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.400
 h of 2 minus 0.1, 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.000
 h of 2 is here. 

00:04:19.001 --> 00:04:22.600
 You draw a tenth and get 9.4, 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.504
 exactly what we see here. 

00:04:24.504 --> 00:04:26.529
 Pausing the video now 

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:28.144
 whether you can define that ... 

00:04:28.144 --> 00:04:30.761
 Create a function that sets or determines 

00:04:30.761 --> 00:04:33.698
 this arithmetic progression apparently. 

00:04:33.698 --> 00:04:34.522
 Here, it was set up recurrently. 

00:04:34.522 --> 00:04:36.735
 We want to make it clear. 

00:04:37.695 --> 00:04:38.888
 Let's just call it, 

00:04:38.888 --> 00:04:41.254
 for example, call it f of n. 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.600
 We can say we have 9.6, 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.260
 we will deduct a number of times, 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.716
 depending on which member we are talking about. 

00:04:51.716 --> 00:04:53.817
 We'll get 0.1, 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.340
 but how many times will we extract it as a function of n? 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.880
 Let's see. 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.028
 If we are talking about the first article, 

00:05:00.028 --> 00:05:02.127
 we remove it 0 times. 

00:05:02.127 --> 00:05:04.968
 Under the second article we remove it one time. 

00:05:04.968 --> 00:05:07.354
 Under the third article, we deduct it twice. 

00:05:07.354 --> 00:05:09.907
 Under the fourth article we remove it three times. 

00:05:09.907 --> 00:05:11.533
 Regardless of which member we are talking about, 

00:05:11.533 --> 00:05:15.468
 we remove that number as many times as the member's number minus 1. 

00:05:15.468 --> 00:05:16.977
 If we talk about nth member, 

00:05:16.977 --> 00:05:21.273
 we subtract this value n minus 1 times. 

00:05:21.273 --> 00:05:23.420
 You can check that this will be the case. 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.738
 When n equals 1, 

00:05:25.738 --> 00:05:27.623
 this article here will be 0, 

00:05:27.623 --> 00:05:28.679
 so this whole thing will be 0. 

00:05:28.679 --> 00:05:30.003
 You get 9.6. 

00:05:30.003 --> 00:05:32.314
 When n equals 2, 

00:05:32.314 --> 00:05:33.619
 2 minus 1, 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.580
 you subtract 0.1 only once. 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.840
 9.6 minus 0.1 is 9.5. 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.680
 You can continue doing it. 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.400
 You can draw a table and calculate it. 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:47.340
 The key point is that you start at 9.6 and you get 0.1 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.400
 with less than the number of the member you are looking at. 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.280
 If n equals 4, 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.920
 you will draw 0.1 times three times, 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.980
 You take 0.1 one time, 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.200
 subtract 0.1 twice, 

00:06:02.206 --> 00:06:06.271
 subtract 0.1 three times.
