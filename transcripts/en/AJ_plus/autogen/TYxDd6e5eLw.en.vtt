00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:18.860
 the 3d camera

 this camera it captures the facial points

 to the whole are 78 points these points are

 given by this camera then we 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:30.200
 has developed software that will 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.450
 analyze these points and classify 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.370

 eyebrows or for example a tongue 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.079
 out given this classification to people 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.990
 can translate them into commands for 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.030
 wheelchair and there in real time 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.010
 the user can smile and to the
