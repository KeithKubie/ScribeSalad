Hi, I'm John Green. Over the last three years
here at Crash Course we've been able to live

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.860
our dream of making educational content that
we can release free, for everyone, forever.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.639
But Crash Course isn't actually super cheap
to make, like we've got to pay for the eagle,

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.819
and also like animators and editors and educators
and our writers...

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.140
We pay for Crash Course partly thanks to the
support of PBS Digital, the public broadcasting

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.640
system in the United States, and partly from
advertising, also partly from grants, from

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.630
people like Bill Gates.
Thank you Bill Gates.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.670
But a huge portion of Crash Course's budget
comes from people, people like you, who traditionally

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.489
have supported us through Subbable.

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.239
Without that support we wouldn't have been to grow
the Crash Course videos; we also wouldn't have been

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.839
able to start making lesson plans, so that teachers
can better integrate Crash Course into their classrooms.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.039
Unfortunately, we recently found out that
Subbable's payment system is being scrapped

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.710
by Amazon. That was a real bummer, but it
was also an opportunity. Because we figured

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.069
you know, as long as people are going to have
to re-enter their information anyway, we should

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:02.880
really just join forces with Patreon.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.860
Patreon's very similar to Subbable— you can make
monthly payments to support stuff that you love

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.380
so that it can continue to exist. The main
difference is that Patreon is much better

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.300
funded, and supported, and has more features,
so in general it's better.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.720
We've known the people who founded Patreon
for many years, they are good people, it is

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.000
a good company, and it also makes even more
sense for you to sign up right now because

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.350
for the first month they are going to match
every dollar that comes into Crash Course,

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.800
so your impact will be doubled. If you're
a Crash Course Subbable subscriber right now

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.340
and you have money in your perk bank don't
worry— we're going to keep the site up for

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.820
several more months and your money will remain
in your perk bank— but you should spend

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.880
it. But we are asking you as soon as possible
to transfer your subscription to Patreon because

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.440
this is a kind of scary time for us.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.100
The money that we make from crowdfunding is
very, very important to Crash Course. It's

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.790
important not only because your support literally
keeps the lights on around here but also because

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:06.020
Patreon is our only source of funding where
passion matters more than views. Like inevitably

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.229
fewer people are going to watch Crash Course
Chemistry than are going to watch, like, Crash

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.120
Course The History of Blood and Guts, but
that doesn't mean that Crash Course Chemistry

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.579
is less important.

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:19.439
So we're hoping that once again enough people
who can pay a little bit per month to support

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:24.249
Crash Course will choose to do so, so that
all people can have access to it. But of course

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:28.400
we understand that lots of people can't afford
to pay, and that's okay. We want Crash Course

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.980
to be there for you. So whether you're able
to help by watching and sharing Crash Course

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.900
or by signing up for a monthly pledge at Patreon
we are deeply in your debt.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.769
There are links below to sign up. Thank you
again for watching Crash Course, for being

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.349
part of this journey with us, and, as we say
in my hometown, don't forget to be awesome.
