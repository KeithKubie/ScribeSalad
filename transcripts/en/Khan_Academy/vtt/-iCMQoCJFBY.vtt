00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.790
- [Instructor] Each dot plot below

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:03.920
represents a different set of data.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.160
We see that here.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.420
Order the dot plots from
largest standard deviation,

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.960
top, to smallest standard
deviation, bottom.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.810
So, pause this video and
see if you can do that

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.360
or at least if you could rank these

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.750
from largest standard deviation

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.543
to smallest standard deviation.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.780
All right, now, let's
work through this together

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.150
and I'm doing this on Khan Academy

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.550
where I can move these
around to order them,

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.060
but let's just remind ourselves

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.650
what the standard deviation is

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.210
or how we can perceive it.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.760
You could view the standard
deviation as a measure

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.450
of the typical distance

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.020
from each of the data points to the mean.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.880
So, the largest standard deviation,

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.230
which you want to put on top,

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.320
would be the one where
typically our data points

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.990
are further from the mean

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.910
and our smallest standard deviation

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.100
would be the ones where it feels like,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.881
on average, our data points
are closer to the mean.

00:00:54.881 --> 00:00:56.950
Well, in all of these examples,

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.210
our mean looks to be right in the center,

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.900
right between 50 and
100, so right around 75.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.200
So, it's really about how
spread apart they are from that.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.790
And if you look at this first one,

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.920
it has these two data points,

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.550
one on the left and one on the right,

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.130
that are pretty far, and then you have

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.420
these two that are a little bit closer,

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.860
and then these two that are inside.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.570
This one right over here,

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.100
to get from this top
one to this middle one

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.140
you essentially are taking this data point

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.880
and making it go further

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.110
and taking this data point
and making it go further

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.500
and so this one is going to
have a higher standard deviation

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.730
than that one, so let me
put it just like that.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.580
And I just want to make it very clear,

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.460
keep track of what's the difference

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.510
between these two things.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.360
Here, you have this data
point and this data point

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.680
that was closer in and then
if you move it further,

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.540
that's going to make your typical distance

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.410
from the middle more, which is
exactly what happened there.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.110
Now, what about this one?

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.310
Well, this one is starting here

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.270
and then taking this point
and taking this point

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.900
and moving it closer
and so that would make

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.080
our typical distance from the middle,

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.870
from the mean, shorter,

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.200
so this would have the
smallest standard deviation

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.200
and this would have the largest.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.963
Let's do another example.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.490
So, same idea, order the dot plots

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.420
from largest standard deviation on the top

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.300
to smallest standard
deviation on the bottom.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.330
Pause this video and see
if you can figure that out.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.310
So, this is interesting

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.130
because these all have different means.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.420
Just eyeballing it, the
mean for this first one

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.800
is right around here, the
mean for the second one

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.560
is right around here, at around 10,

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.200
and the mean for the third one,

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.890
it looks like the same
mean as this top one.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.860
And so, pause this video.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.110
How would you order them?

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.030
All right, so just eyeballing it,

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.800
these, this middle one right over here,

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.660
your typical data point seems furthest

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.570
from the mean, you definitely have,

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.150
if the mean is here,
you have this data point

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.990
and this data point that are quite far

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.630
from that mean, and even this data point

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.030
and this data point are at least as far

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.810
as any of the data points that we have

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:09.900
in the top or the bottom one,

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.100
so, I would say this has the
largest standard deviation

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.063
and if I were to compare
between these two,

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.530
if you think about how you
would get the difference

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.650
between these two, is if
you took this data point

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.320
and moved it to the mean and
if you took this data point

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.140
and you moved it to the mean,

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.720
you would get this third situation.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.830
And so, this third situation
you have the fewest data points

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.610
that are sitting away from the mean

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:39.890
relative to this one.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.880
And so, I actually like this ordering

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.250
that this top one has the
largest standard deviation

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.983
and this bottom one has the
smallest standard deviation.
