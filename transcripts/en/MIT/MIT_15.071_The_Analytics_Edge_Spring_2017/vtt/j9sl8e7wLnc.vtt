00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.550
Using our regression
models, we would

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.300
like to predict before
the season starts

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.910
how many games the 2002
Oakland A's will win.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.450
To do this, we first
have to predict

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.640
how many runs the
team will score

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.070
and how many runs
they will allow.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.890
These models use
team statistics.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.100
However, when we are
predicting for the 2002 Oakland

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.700
A's before the
season has occurred,

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.980
the team is probably different
than it was the year before.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.670
So we don't know
the team statistics.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.180
But we can estimate these
statistics using past player

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.520
performance.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.420
This approach assumes that
past performance correlates

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.520
with future performance
and that there

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.480
will be few injuries
during the season.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.850
Using this approach, we can
estimate the team statistics

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.050
for 2002 by using the
2001 player statistics.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.360
Let's start by making a
prediction for runs scored.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.170
At the beginning
of the 2002 season,

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.340
the Oakland A's had 24
batters on their roster.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.140
Using the 2001 regular season
statistics for these players,

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.510
we can estimate that team
on-base percentage will be

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:23.330
about 0.339 and team slugging
percentage will be about 0.430.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.350
We built the following linear
regression equation in R

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.640
to predict runs scored.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.560
If we plug in 0.339 for
on-base percentage and 0.430

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.060
for slugging percentage, we
predict that the 2002 Oakland

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.060
A's will score about 805 runs.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.660
Similarly, we can make a
prediction for runs allowed.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.340
At the beginning
of the 2002 season,

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.300
the Oakland A's had 17
pitchers on their roster.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.810
Using the 2001 regular season
statistics for these players,

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.990
we can estimate that team
opponent on-base percentage

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.960
will be about 0.307 and team
opponent slugging percentage

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.800
will be about 0.373.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.590
Our regression equation
to predict runs allowed

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.530
was as follows.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.370
By plugging in
0.307 for opponents

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.990
on-base percentage and 0.373 for
opponents slugging percentage,

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:33.070
we predict that the 2002
Oakland A's will allow 622 runs.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.460
We can now make a prediction for
how many games they will win.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.510
Our regression equation to
predict wins is as follows.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:48.370
We predicted 805 runs
scored and 622 runs allowed.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.800
We can plug in the difference
between runs scored

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.620
and runs allowed to
predict that the A's

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.520
will win 100 games in 2002.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.280
Paul DePodesta used a similar
approach to make predictions.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.790
It turns out that our
predictions and Paul's

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.000
predictions closely
match actual performance.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.650
Our prediction for runs
scored was 805 runs.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.730
Paul predicted between
800 and 820 runs.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.400
And it turns out that the
2002 Oakland A's actually

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.020
scored 800 runs.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.100
For runs allowed,
we predicted 622.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.079
Paul DePodesta predicted
between 650 and 670.

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:39.050
It turns out that the Oakland
A's actually allowed 653 runs.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.250
For wins, we predicted that
they would win 100 games.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.670
Paul predicted that they would
win between 93 and 97 games.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.420
And they actually 103 games.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.070
These predictions
show us that by using

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.480
publicly available data
and simple analytics,

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.560
we can predict very close
to what actually happened

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.340
before the season even started.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.870
It turns out that the A's
won a league record in 2002

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.350
by winning 20 games in a row.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.940
And they won 1 more game
than the previous year

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.160
and made it to the
playoffs once again.
