00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:11.350
This collection of materials here: this
is, and it's and it sounds, you know,

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.529
horrible, and it is, but this is from our
African American Miscellany Collection.

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:25.060
These are slave bills. So the the file
says 1814 to 1829. So these would have

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:32.140
been people sold or purchased during the
same time period in which David Walker lived.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.960
This one here is from the
state of Louisiana. And it is from the

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:44.060
Parish of St. Landry. And I'll just read
some of it here.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.340
It says, No all men by

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:55.740
these presence that I, John Compton, of
Bayou Boeuf, for and in consideration

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:01.700
of the sum of three thousand two hundred
and fifty dollars cash in hand paid the

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.940
receipt where of is hereby acknowledge
have granted bargained and sold, and to

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:18.520
do by these presence grant, bargain, sell,
and believe unto Mr. Joseph LaRose

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:26.160
Fountinot, of the aforesaid parish of St.
Landry County, three Negro boys named

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:32.200
Dick, aged about fourteen years, Dave, aged
about fourteen, and Carter, aged about

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:40.819
thirteen. And for myself my heirs the
little of the said Negroes to the said

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:46.090
Joseph LaRose Fontenot,
and his heirs. And I

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:53.149
warrant and will forever defend as also
against every kind of malady or disease

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.100
prescribed by law.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.900
And witnessing whereof
I have here unto set my hand and

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:08.580
seal in presence of John M Debaillon
Notary Public in and for the aforesaid

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:15.860
parish of St. Landry,
this 10th day of June 1818

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:23.520
Then you have the signatures of Compton
Debaillon and Fontenot.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.540
I mean, this is 2018.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:37.959
This is 200 years ago.  That's crazy. I mean, but it's real.

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:44.950
I'm holding a document here that
represents the purchase, the sale, the

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.480
disposition, of three human beings, three
boys. And we have the names: Dick, Dave, and Carter,

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.160
ages 13 and 14.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.740
That's absolutely nuts.
And we see that this

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.180
was a business transaction. Official seal
is here. There's a notary. This is a

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.810
business transaction,
human beings. And this is what David

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.650
Walker is talking about the idea that
these people are being treated as

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:22.900
animals, and can you get any lower than
that. 200 years old.
