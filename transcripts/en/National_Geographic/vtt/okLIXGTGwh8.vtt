00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.330
fire

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.690
no single tool in the human Arsenal

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:20.380
explains our existence more than fire

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:23.650
from an animal like any other to the

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.689
dominant species on earth because we

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.359
figured out how to steal from the

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:32.770
heavens and harness the power of the Sun

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:35.769
was a piece of magic so exceptional so

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.989
inexplicable we told our children was a

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:40.809
gift from the gods and turned it into a

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:43.199
myth to be handed down for thousands of

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.199
these years

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:09.830
heat nourishment transportation

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:15.100
communication annihilation fire made us

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.100
warriors and builders and explorers

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:24.270
with each advance we paid with our blood

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:26.580
but still we kept going and today we

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.340
break through the bonds of Earth escape

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.680
archeage the only thing we see when we

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.430
look back is the light of our greatest

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.770
conquest like a flame that cannot be

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.070
extinguished drive within us to create

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.610
expand and dominate not just this world

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:49.700
but the next the very spark of humanity

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:52.360
starts here with fire

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.480
this is origins
