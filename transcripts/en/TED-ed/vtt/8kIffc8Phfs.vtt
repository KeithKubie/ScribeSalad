00:00:00.172 --> 00:00:05.272
Hi I'm Andrea Gibson and this
is my poem "The Nutritionist."

00:00:05.272 --> 00:00:07.772
The nutritionist said I should
eat root vegetables

00:00:07.772 --> 00:00:09.893
Said if I could get down 13 turnips a day

00:00:09.893 --> 00:00:11.125
I would be grounded,

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:11.861
rooted.

00:00:11.861 --> 00:00:15.099
Said my head would not keep flying away 
to where the darkness lives.

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:17.587
The psychic told me my heart
carries too much weight

00:00:17.587 --> 00:00:19.498
Said for 20 dollars she’d tell me what to do

00:00:19.498 --> 00:00:21.053
I handed her the twenty, she said

00:00:21.053 --> 00:00:24.278
“stop worrying darling, you 
will find a good man soon.”

00:00:24.278 --> 00:00:29.138
The first psychotherapist said I should 
spend 3 hours a day sitting in a dark closet

00:00:29.138 --> 00:00:31.587
with my eyes closed 
and my ears plugged.

00:00:31.587 --> 00:00:33.648
I tried it once but couldn’t 
stop thinking

00:00:33.648 --> 00:00:36.878
about how gay it was to be
sitting in the closet.

00:00:36.878 --> 00:00:40.307
The yogi told me to stretch 
everything but truth,

00:00:40.307 --> 00:00:42.257
said focus on the outbreaths,

00:00:42.257 --> 00:00:43.717
said everyone finds happiness

00:00:43.717 --> 00:00:46.877
if they can care more about what they
can give than what they get.

00:00:46.877 --> 00:00:50.268
The pharmacist said klonopin,
lamictil, lithium, Xanax.

00:00:50.268 --> 00:00:54.141
The doctor said an antipsychotic
might help me forget what the trauma said

00:00:54.141 --> 00:00:56.227
The trauma said don’t write this poem.

00:00:56.227 --> 00:01:00.397
Nobody wants to hear you cry 
about the grief inside your bones

00:01:00.397 --> 00:01:01.718
But my bones said

00:01:01.718 --> 00:01:07.238
“Tyler Clementi dove into the Hudson River
convinced he was entirely alone.”

00:01:07.238 --> 00:01:10.551
My bones said “write the poem.”

00:01:10.551 --> 00:01:11.798
The lamplight.

00:01:11.798 --> 00:01:13.097
Considering the river bed.

00:01:13.097 --> 00:01:16.426
To the chandelier of your fate hanging by a thread.

00:01:16.426 --> 00:01:18.855
To everyday you could not get out of bed.

00:01:18.855 --> 00:01:20.718
To the bulls eye of your wrist

00:01:20.718 --> 00:01:23.167
To anyone who has ever wanted to die.

00:01:23.167 --> 00:01:26.647
I have been told, sometimes, 
the most healing thing we can do-

00:01:26.647 --> 00:01:29.717
Is remind ourselves over and over and over

00:01:29.717 --> 00:01:31.888
Other people feel this too

00:01:31.888 --> 00:01:33.667
The tomorrow that has come and gone

00:01:33.667 --> 00:01:35.277
And it has not gotten better

00:01:35.277 --> 00:01:38.188
When you are half finished writing
that letter to your mother

00:01:38.188 --> 00:01:40.148
that says “I swear to God I tried”

00:01:40.148 --> 00:01:43.137
But when I thought I hit bottom, 
it started hitting back

00:01:43.137 --> 00:01:47.027
There is no bruise like the bruise of
loneliness kicks into your spine

00:01:47.027 --> 00:01:47.957
So let me tell you

00:01:47.957 --> 00:01:52.057
I know there are days it looks like 
the whole world is dancing in the streets

00:01:52.057 --> 00:01:55.586
when you break down like the doors
of their looted buildings

00:01:55.586 --> 00:02:00.287
You are not alone and wondering who will 
be convicted of the crime of insisting

00:02:00.287 --> 00:02:03.877
you keep loading your grief into 
the chamber of your shame

00:02:03.877 --> 00:02:07.227
You are not weak just because 
your heart feels so heavy

00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:12.068
I have never met a heavy heart that wasn’t
a phone booth with a red cape inside

00:02:12.068 --> 00:02:15.667
Some people will never understand 
the kind of superpower it takes

00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:18.357
for some people to just walk outside

00:02:18.357 --> 00:02:22.210
Some days I know my smile looks like
the gutter of a falling house

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.407
But my hands are always holding tight
to the ripchord of believing

00:02:26.407 --> 00:02:29.267
A life can be rich like the soil

00:02:29.267 --> 00:02:30.688
Make food of decay

00:02:30.688 --> 00:02:32.938
Turn wound into highway

00:02:32.938 --> 00:02:36.368
Pick me up in a truck with that 
bumper sticker that says

00:02:36.368 --> 00:02:41.528
“it is no measure of good health
to be well adjusted to a sick society”

00:02:41.528 --> 00:02:45.617
I have never trusted anyone with 
the pulled back bow of my spine

00:02:45.617 --> 00:02:49.309
the way I trust the ones who 
come undone at the throat

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:53.248
Screaming for their pulse 
to find the fight to pound

00:02:53.248 --> 00:02:58.166
Four nights before Tyler Clementi 
jumped from the George Washington bridge

00:02:58.166 --> 00:03:01.316
I was sitting in a hotel room
in my own town

00:03:01.316 --> 00:03:06.771
Calculating exactly what I had to swallow 
to keep a bottle of sleeping pills down

00:03:06.771 --> 00:03:11.498
What I know about living 
is the pain is never just ours

00:03:11.498 --> 00:03:14.988
Every time I hurt I know
the wound is an echo

00:03:14.988 --> 00:03:19.148
So I keep a listening for the moment
when the grief becomes a window

00:03:19.148 --> 00:03:22.039
When I can see what I couldn’t see before,

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:24.297
through the glass of 
my most battered dream,

00:03:24.297 --> 00:03:27.647
I watched a dandelion lose
its mind in the wind

00:03:27.647 --> 00:03:30.938
and when it did, it scattered 
a thousand seeds.

00:03:30.938 --> 00:03:35.068
So the next time I tell you 
how easily I come out of my skin,

00:03:35.068 --> 00:03:37.148
don’t try to put me back in

00:03:37.148 --> 00:03:42.713
just say here we are together at
the window aching for it to all get better

00:03:42.713 --> 00:03:47.009
but knowing there is a chance our hearts
may have only just skinned their knees

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:51.209
knowing there is a chance the worst 
day might still be coming

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.268
let me say right now for the record, 
I’m still gonna be here

00:03:55.268 --> 00:04:00.699
asking this world to dance, 
even if it keeps stepping on my holy feet

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:03.767
you- you stay here with me, okay?

00:04:03.767 --> 00:04:05.448
You stay here with me.

00:04:05.448 --> 00:04:08.308
Raising your bite against the bitter dark

00:04:08.308 --> 00:04:09.537
Your bright longing

00:04:09.537 --> 00:04:11.827
Your brilliant fists of loss

00:04:11.827 --> 00:04:12.798
Friend

00:04:12.798 --> 00:04:16.048
if the only thing we have to gain
in staying is each other,

00:04:16.048 --> 00:04:17.947
my god that’s plenty

00:04:17.947 --> 00:04:19.617
my god that’s enough

00:04:19.617 --> 00:04:22.596
my god that is so so much
for the light to give

00:04:22.596 --> 00:04:28.007
each of us at each other’s backs
whispering over and over and over

00:04:28.007 --> 00:04:29.207
“Live”

00:04:29.207 --> 00:04:30.199
“Live”

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:32.170
“Live”
