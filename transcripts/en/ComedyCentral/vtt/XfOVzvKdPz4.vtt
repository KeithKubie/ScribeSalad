00:00:01.567 --> 00:00:03.570
- Hello mindless cogs,

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.872
and welcome to the 7 Million
Habits of Highly Effective

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.006
Hampton Deville Employees.

00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:09.000
- Habit number 428,

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.240
remember everyone's name.

00:00:11.244 --> 00:00:13.779
- Remembering the names of
coworkers makes you seem

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:16.882
invested in and
focused on the company.

00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:19.518
- And if you have a hard time
remembering people's names,

00:00:19.518 --> 00:00:20.953
try this handy little trick.

00:00:20.953 --> 00:00:24.023
- Associate names with memories
that mean something to you.

00:00:24.023 --> 00:00:26.893
- For instance, I associate
John's name with a memory

00:00:26.893 --> 00:00:29.229
of an earthquake that
destroyed my childhood home.

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:31.564
- And I associate Kate's
name with a memory

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:34.400
of the affair I had with the
admissions director at Yale.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.235
- Nice.

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:36.769
- His name was Glen.

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:38.804
Worse case scenario, if you
can't remember someone's name,

00:00:38.804 --> 00:00:41.908
you can always just be like,

00:00:41.908 --> 00:00:42.976
Hey, hey you.

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:45.077
- Oh hi.

00:00:45.077 --> 00:00:46.245
- How's it going?

00:00:46.245 --> 00:00:47.212
- Hey good.

00:00:47.212 --> 00:00:49.649
- How are your adorable little?

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.150
- Parents?

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.085
- Your parents, how are your
adorable little parents?

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:52.918
- They're fantastic.

00:00:52.918 --> 00:00:53.886
- Yeah?

00:00:53.886 --> 00:00:54.921
Oh by the way my name is John.

00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:55.955
(screams)

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:57.290
And that's how you do it.
