00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.705
So the third part that we now want to look at is ISO, which is sensitivity.

00:00:04.705 --> 00:00:09.030
So we've looked at, for example, how we can control the aperture and

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.289
the shutter speed.

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:13.770
But now we also need to also count for the fact that we have another part of

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.930
the triangle which is, how sensitive is my film?

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.100
Now, this is dependent on a concept that has,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.940
has been done with films a lot before.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.468
And when you had actually picked up a film yourself,

00:00:24.468 --> 00:00:26.829
you may have seen it has numbers like ISO 100.

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:28.780
Here I'm just showing you two examples.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.357
ISO 100, ISO 1600.

00:00:31.357 --> 00:00:34.260
So this is an actually an important parameter on how we

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.370
get the right exposure of an image that we're looking for.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.990
Film, a concept that started while film was how sensitive is the film?

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.110
Now, it really depended.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.940
The sensitivity of the film really depended on the chemicals that

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.100
were put on it.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.930
That is, how much light sensitive is the film, and of course,

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.660
to achieve, that you would have to put more chemicals.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.700
Just by the limitations of how much chemicals you could put on

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.629
a film grain would result in basically how much granularity you would have.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.440
because you really can't put in a lot of light sensitive chemicals on a film

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.000
with restrictions on, you know, the density of the film and

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.010
all that kind of stuff.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.720
When we look at film,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.440
we'll talk a little bit about that in the next sub-lecture.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.400
In case of digital, basically it comes out to is,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.260
what is the sensitivity of the sensor itself.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.220
Again, when we look at sensors, we'll discuss this a little bit more carefully.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.836
But here, basically, the bottom line is, the sensor sensitivity is can be

00:01:30.836 --> 00:01:34.690
now replicated by a number equivalent to the ISO.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.110
Just as a important point to note,

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.610
the relationship between different ISO values is linear.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.980
A 200 ISO needs half the light of a 100 ISO.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.660
So this one actually would take lots of nature lights, but

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.820
1600 would be something I can use indoor without a lot of light.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.630
Just to show you the details of this kind of stuff.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.242
Here you can see the images of the ISO zoomed in, ISO 100 zoomed in.

00:02:03.242 --> 00:02:05.842
And this is ISO 1,600 zoomed in.

00:02:05.842 --> 00:02:09.389
And here you might be able to see a lot of noise in

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.947
the two different colors of yellow and green.

00:02:12.947 --> 00:02:16.281
And the boundaries should also be a little bit blurred, because again,

00:02:16.281 --> 00:02:18.361
more chemicals have been put into this film,

00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:21.720
which basically means that there's mixing going on a little bit here.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.640
These find is crisp.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.640
Of course, ISO 1600 would be used something where there's low light conditions.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.420
ISO 100 would be used when it's nice and sunny.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.290
But, again, photographers play around with this depending on what

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.850
their needs are.
