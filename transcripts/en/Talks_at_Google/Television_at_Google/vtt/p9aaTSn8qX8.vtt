00:00:05.203 --> 00:00:06.904
ALAN SEALES: So, OK, Sam.

00:00:06.904 --> 00:00:07.570
SAM ESMAIL: Yes.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.462
ALAN SEALES: You used
to be a hacker, yes?

00:00:11.462 --> 00:00:12.170
SAM ESMAIL: Yeah.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:12.970
ALAN SEALES: Would you
call yourself that?

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:14.386
SAM ESMAIL: I don't
know because I

00:00:14.386 --> 00:00:18.200
don't want to offend real
brilliant hackers out there.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.520
I was a very bad one.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.225
I got caught doing
simple email spoof.

00:00:24.225 --> 00:00:25.850
And I got a busted
on that because they

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.070
traced the IP to my computer
lab job that I was working on.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.320
I am a very, very bad--
I used to be very, very

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.500
bad low-level hacker.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.000
CHRISTIAN SLATER: Did guys show
up at your house after that?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.510
Or--

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.445
SAM ESMAIL: No, I just got fired
and put on academic probation.

00:00:39.445 --> 00:00:41.820
ALAN SEALES: So, does the NSA
know you're here right now?

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.510
Do we need to worry about that?

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.110
SAM ESMAIL: There's a file.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.460
There's definitely a file.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.370
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.536
SAM ESMAIL: Very small file.

00:00:47.536 --> 00:00:50.170
ALAN SEALES: So,
the show itself--

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.830
does very poor hacking.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.680
So the show itself deals,
primarily in my opinion,

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.160
like with the inequality,
financial inequality,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.990
between 99% and the 1%.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.880
Like where did this
come from in your mind?

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.900
SAM ESMAIL: Well, I said I was
like one of those angry nerds

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.210
in high school, right?

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.960
Where you read-- like you
were like Holden Caulfield

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.120
and, fuck the man,
that kind of thing.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.060
And there was something
about that angst

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.220
that I thought it was
always interesting.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.390
And you know, so I'm Egyptian
and I have a lot of family

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.630
over in Egypt.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.120
And they had just gone
through the Arab Spring,

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.340
and they have that kind
of spirit too that caused

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.310
this revolution over there.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.710
And there is something
about this anger

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.430
channeled in this
real positive way

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.510
to bring about change that I
thought was really interesting.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.670
And so when I go back to
99% thing and the income

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.070
inequality, that's
frustrating a lot of people.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.371
And there's a lot of
anger around that.

00:01:52.371 --> 00:01:54.120
And there was the whole
Occupy Wall Street

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.770
Movement around that.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.990
So I just took that as more of
a way to build the character.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.740
This kid--

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.823
ALAN SEALES: Have you been
working on this since--

00:02:02.823 --> 00:02:03.790
for now back with--

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.440
SAM ESMAIL: Well,
no, because I mean

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.984
I've always wanted to, because
I think the hacker culture is

00:02:07.984 --> 00:02:09.150
actually really interesting.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.770
I grew up knowing
a lot of hackers.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.454
And watching television
movies about hackers

00:02:15.454 --> 00:02:16.620
is incredibly disappointing.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.410
CHRISTIAN SLATER: Frustrating.

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.930
Frustrating.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.150
SAM ESMAIL: Really, really.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.350
Yes let's go through
with frustrating.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.370
CHRISTIAN SLATER: Let's
go with frustrating.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.080
ALAN SEALES: Well, you don't
want to reroute the encryption

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.121
and bypass the mainframe?

00:02:25.121 --> 00:02:26.670
Oh, look I downloaded.

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:27.717
I fixed it.

00:02:27.717 --> 00:02:30.300
SAM ESMAIL: Although I do like--
have you ever seen the movie,

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.922
"Hackers"?

00:02:30.922 --> 00:02:31.880
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, yes.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.670
SAM ESMAIL: I mean it's--

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.450
ALAN SEALES: It's horrible.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.720
SAM ESMAIL: It's horrible.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.370
ALAN SEALES: I'll
put it out there.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.070
SAM ESMAIL: OK.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.000
But I do love it.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.430
But any way, so I really had
always wanted to do movie,

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.840
televisions show about hacking.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.180
And I would say, when the
financial meltdown happened,

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.950
I was pretty, I would
say, offended would

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.580
be the nice way of putting it.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.470
And I remember it started
inspiring the character.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.960
But then about a
couple years ago,

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.130
is when I infused it with this
whole idea of a hacker who

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.112
sort of had that point of view.

00:03:07.112 --> 00:03:09.320
ALAN SEALES: Interesting
so, Christian, you look just

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.392
like the guy from "Archer."

00:03:11.392 --> 00:03:14.710
CHRISTIAN SLATER: Oh, yeah.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.070
Slater.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.790
ALAN SEALES: So did
you do the role?

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.900
I mean do you have background
with any sort of technology

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:22.952
like this either?

00:03:22.952 --> 00:03:25.160
Or you're just kind of
pulling out your acting chops?

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.080
CHRISTIAN SLATER: Yeah,
I'm digging deep here

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.310
with a lot of this stuff.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.880
Yeah, I mean our joke was that
I was hack proof because I

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.092
had one of those light-proof
cases around my iPhone.

00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:38.300
ALAN SEALES: The Otter cases?

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.520
CHRISTIAN SLATER: Yeah,
I had one of those.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.910
I was like, I'm perfectly safe.

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.980
But I just made the
switch to a Mophie.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.670
I can't make that joke anymore.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.210
But, yeah, so
technology- I mean,

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.430
I have a computer, of course.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.640
And I've gotten better, but
as we were making the show,

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.400
there are moments,
where I'd be like,

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.090
what's this the
abbreviation here?

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.570
CPU?

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:01.450
I needed some help.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:02.340
ALAN SEALES: AFK.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.880
CHRISTIAN SLATER: AFK.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.255
Yeah there were
things like that,

00:04:04.255 --> 00:04:06.380
where I was a little
out of my depth.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.230
SAM ESMAIL: But he
said them really well.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.200
CHRISTIAN SLATER:
Yeah, I enunciated.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:11.850
Yeah.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:12.944
"Ska-dah."

00:04:12.944 --> 00:04:14.360
ALAN SEALES: Yeah,
though, working

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.401
with the younger actors--

00:04:15.401 --> 00:04:19.794
CHRISTIAN SLATER: I just Binged
the definition and I was fine.

00:04:19.794 --> 00:04:22.590
All right, all right, all right.

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.010
Where am I?

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.260
ALAN SEALES: So working with--

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.780
CHRISTIAN SLATER: He
set me up with that.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.320
SAM ESMAIL: Yeah,

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.230
ALAN SEALES: Shh,
don't tell him that.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.964
So working with the
younger actors then,

00:04:33.964 --> 00:04:35.880
is it good for you, fun
for you, or different,

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:36.530
because the younger
actors grew up--

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.006
CHRISTIAN SLATER: I hate it.

00:04:38.006 --> 00:04:38.600
No, of course.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.100
I love it.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.020
They're great.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.286
Rami is amazing, right?

00:04:42.286 --> 00:04:44.160
SAM ESMAIL: He's terrible
at technology, too.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.590
ALAN SEALES: Is he really?

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.790
SAM ESMAIL: Don't think
just because he's younger--

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.980
CHRISTIAN SLATER:
Yeah, it's all illusion

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.000
that these guys are so skillful.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.956
And we rely on Sam--

00:04:54.956 --> 00:04:56.580
SAM ESMAIL: And I
rely on other people.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.538
CHRISTIAN SLATER: --and
other technical people.

00:04:58.538 --> 00:05:00.920
When we first got the
script, we did that scene

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.642
on the Ferris wheel, it was
like an eight page script

00:05:03.642 --> 00:05:05.100
and there were a
lot of definitions

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.540
in there, root kits and a lot
of different technical terms.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.120
And I'd worked on the scene.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.500
I had memorized
it, that I really

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.340
wanted to get all
those terms just right.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.280
And then he met with
another technical expert,

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.000
who then updated those terms.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.750
SAM ESMAIL: It screwed
up his whole scene.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.280
CHRISTIAN SLATER: It made it
a little bit more confusing,

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.720
figuring out IP addresses
and the right numbers to say

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.620
was tricky.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:31.640
ALAN SEALES: So you're
getting at least getting

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:32.740
a better grasp of it now.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:33.510
CHRISTIAN SLATER:
I'm starting to.

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:34.530
ALAN SEALES: You know
what an IP address is.

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:35.910
CHRISTIAN SLATER: I think so.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.548
SAM ESMAIL: Yeah,
so we're talking

00:05:37.548 --> 00:05:39.506
about filming on the
Ferris wheel though, like,

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:40.560
you filmed in New York.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.090
CHRISTIAN SLATER: Right.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.170
ALAN SEALES: So what
are the challenges?

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:44.003
CHRISTIAN SLATER:
Greatest city of all time.

00:05:44.003 --> 00:05:46.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.520
Working here is the greatest.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.130
And we're shooting
at Silver Cup Studios

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.260
so I can still smell
Alec Baldwin's cologne

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.700
from "30 Rock."

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.260
His presence is
definitely there.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.150
He's left a mark.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.180
You know, Tina Fey, all
those people were there.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.060
So just to be able to walk
around and take the subway.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.312
I take the E train
right over the--

00:06:08.312 --> 00:06:10.020
and it's a two-minute
walk to the studio.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.769
So it's thrilling.

00:06:10.769 --> 00:06:13.360
And then the offices of F
Society were at Coney Island.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.505
So that was amazing.

00:06:14.505 --> 00:06:16.130
ALAN SEALES: Well,
which I did actually

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:17.340
look on Google Maps
for the address

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.950
It is not what it's
supposed to be.

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.990
So I'm disappointed.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.030
So I looked up
psychiatrist's Facebook page,

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:29.660
which is not real and looked up
the address, which is not real.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.290
CHRISTIAN SLATER: Genius.

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:32.540
ALAN SEALES: You're at Google.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.040
Of course, we fact check here.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.670
So those were not real,
but in terms of-- I'm

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.520
trying to find my card
with all this on there.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.260
BlackBerry, Steve Jobs, Hunger
Games, Facebook, Josh Groban,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.780
Maroon 5, Gchat, you
use so many brand names

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.709
that makes it-- pulls
me in personally

00:06:50.709 --> 00:06:52.750
and I feel like I have a
better connection to it.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.650
And I guess being technological,
I relate more to it a little

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.140
more too.

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.330
But at the same time, it's
almost comic book-esque

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:05.430
in that you have such an obvious
approach to the evil side.

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:07.690
Like, name is Evil Corp, right?

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.320
Which looks like a cross
between Enron and Dell.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.450
Was that on purpose?

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.040
SAM ESMAIL: No, it
is the Enron logo.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.380
ALAN SEALES: Oh, is it?

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:14.546
SAM ESMAIL: We just took it.

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.540
I don't think anybody's going
to be fighting for that logo.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.251
It was easy to get.

00:07:23.251 --> 00:07:25.842
Oh, my god.

00:07:25.842 --> 00:07:27.800
ALAN SEALES: Like at what
point where you said,

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.425
I'm going to make
this as real as I can

00:07:29.425 --> 00:07:32.010
and then make it as
obviously fake and evil?

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:34.482
SAM ESMAIL: Well, that
was an interesting one.

00:07:34.482 --> 00:07:37.160
Because there's the line in
there where he reprograms

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.857
his mind to see, think, and
hear, Evil Corp every time

00:07:40.857 --> 00:07:42.190
he sees the name of the company.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:43.899
And I had one
point said, we were

00:07:43.899 --> 00:07:45.690
going to bleep out the
name of the company.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:48.240
We would never actually hear
the name of the company.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.380
And you would just hear
Evil Corp in the show

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:53.170
because that's
Elliot's point of view.

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:57.770
But then I was just like,
you know, it's Evil Corp

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:00.660
and the more I got used
it, the more I was like,

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.740
I think people, when
watching the show,

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.900
I don't we stylize in such
a way that they're like,

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:09.180
they're are too over the
top or anything like that.

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.780
I think we still kind of keep
it in the grounded world.

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.780
But the names is Evil
Corp. I don't know.

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.080
I just kind felt fine with it.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.357
ALAN SEALES: It made sense
to me because Elliot talks

00:08:18.357 --> 00:08:20.440
to the audience, which is
a character in the show.

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.523
And it felt like talking--

00:08:21.523 --> 00:08:23.824
SAM ESMAIL: With an
imaginary friend.

00:08:23.824 --> 00:08:25.490
ALAN SEALES: So it
was interesting to me

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:27.070
that he explained like,
this is Evil Corp. This

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:29.403
is what we call them and then
from that point on, that's

00:08:29.403 --> 00:08:31.580
what they always were,
which was very interesting

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:32.330
and it fit to me.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.247
I realized at the end
of the show that I said,

00:08:34.247 --> 00:08:36.413
oh, they never actually
said what the real name was.

00:08:36.413 --> 00:08:37.169
And I didn't care.

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:37.668
Right.

00:08:37.668 --> 00:08:38.270
So good job.

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:40.419
Good job with that.

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:42.590
So Elliott, I'm
going to quote him.

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:43.260
Here.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:44.750
After the opening scene
in the coffee shop

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:46.125
he says, "In three
short minutes,

00:08:46.125 --> 00:08:48.360
I've destroyed a man's
business, life existence.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.806
I deleted him."

00:08:50.806 --> 00:08:53.910
The language that Elliot
uses is very deliberate.

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:57.250
And it's almost a
dichotomy against what

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:58.940
your character says as well.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.750
Because Elliot has
social anxiety.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.810
He's got some social
issues and of course, I

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:05.340
assume that was
on purpose, right?

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:06.229
SAM ESMAIL: Correct,

00:09:06.229 --> 00:09:08.020
ALAN SEALES: Like from
personal experience?

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.640
SAM ESMAIL: Yes.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.890
ALAN SEALES: So how
does your character--

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:16.990
you seem a little bit smarter,
a little bit more aware, much

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:18.830
more socially inept.

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:20.590
CHRISTIAN SLATER: That's nice.

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:21.460
ALAN SEALES: Like
the character is.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:22.080
CHRISTIAN SLATER: The character.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.329
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:27.750
CHRISTIAN SLATER: Let's
just be clear about that.

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:31.230
Not Christian Slater but
Mr. Robot is definitely more

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:32.560
socially aware.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:33.352
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:09:33.352 --> 00:09:35.018
CHRISTIAN SLATER: But
the question iis--

00:09:35.018 --> 00:09:37.350
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, so the
question is-- no, I just

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:38.600
want to stop right there.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.850
So the question is
how much of that

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:44.026
is on purpose, I guess from
the writing and how much of it

00:09:44.026 --> 00:09:46.150
is acting choice and how
you present the character?

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:52.090
CHRISTIAN SLATER:
Well, let's see.

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:55.260
I think the age
factor I think, is

00:09:55.260 --> 00:10:00.320
this is helpful there, that I
am playing this sort of mentor

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.362
type character to this
younger guy and sort

00:10:02.362 --> 00:10:08.360
of manipulating in him and
bringing him into this world.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.850
So that sort of
makes it seductive.

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:12.850
You know, when you're
reading a scene like that.

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:15.810
It's fun to play
that sort of thing,

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:19.550
to play that sort of
seductive character

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:24.740
and begin to control and
manipulate and mold somebody

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:29.730
to do things for you that
they might not normally

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:32.540
consider doing.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.190
So, yeah, I mean those are
definitely acting choices.

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:38.330
I mean, the material
was there to work with.

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:40.630
I think the scene was
structured very well

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:41.890
and written very well.

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:46.630
So it just made conveying
that a lot easier,

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:49.154
definitely for me as an actor.

00:10:49.154 --> 00:10:50.570
SAM ESMAIL: So did
you write that?

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:53.190
It was doubly intentional
because the whole

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:56.740
show I think is about this
guy who's trying to connect.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:00.530
The whole irony of the show
is, he can't talk to people,

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:05.830
but he knows every personal
detail about their lives.

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:10.650
And so here's this guy
who is the exact opposite.

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:14.960
He can talk to anybody and
charismatic and he's open

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.660
and he's Christian Slater.

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:22.024
And he basically begins to
draw this thing out of Elliot.

00:11:22.024 --> 00:11:23.690
CHRISTIAN SLATER:
Yeah, that is the key.

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:25.150
SAM ESMAIL: Get him
out of that shell.

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:27.000
CHRISTIAN SLATER: It was
so yin and yang there.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:27.880
SAM ESMAIL: Yeah, yeah.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.713
CHRISTIAN SLATER: That
he is so introverted,

00:11:29.713 --> 00:11:33.590
and I'm definitely much
more outgoing and playing

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:34.340
that other side.

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:35.650
SAM ESMAIL: Yeah.

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:37.810
ALAN SEALES: It's
works well together.

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:40.111
Again bravo.

00:11:40.111 --> 00:11:44.280
So I guess, no offense to the
USA reps standing in the back,

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.970
but this show is a lot
more edgy than anything

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.530
that I have seen
on USA thus far.

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:52.120
Like, you've got a little
bit of a nudity in there.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.370
There's some shits
and some f-bombs

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:56.330
throughout the whole thing.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:58.749
That's not going to
air like that, is that?

00:11:58.749 --> 00:11:59.790
SAM ESMAIL: I don't know.

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:01.290
You should ask them.

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:05.530
I keep putting f-bombs
in every episode.

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:07.109
And--

00:12:07.109 --> 00:12:08.900
CHRISTIAN SLATER:
Nobody's saying anything.

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:09.940
SAM ESMAIL: Yeah.

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:11.690
ALAN SEALES: Well,
they're saying f-bombs.

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:14.850
Well, USA isn't saying it.

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:16.317
SAM ESMAIL: I think they air it.

00:12:16.317 --> 00:12:17.650
I don't know what the rules are.

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:19.108
I think after a
certain point, they

00:12:19.108 --> 00:12:21.571
can't share it with
certain language.

00:12:21.571 --> 00:12:23.070
And then they00 but
see, to me, it's

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:28.560
like there's always the
post-life of the show, YouTube,

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.425
excuse me, GooglePlay.

00:12:31.425 --> 00:12:32.800
ALAN SEALES: No,
YouTube is good.

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.050
SAM ESMAIL: Hopefully we're
going to be on GooglePlay.

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:39.290
So yeah, things like that,
where then it's unfiltered.

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:43.040
But, yeah, I think for
the premier, definitely

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.780
the whole fuck society
speech, I think they're

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:46.880
planning on airing that.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:48.110
ALAN SEALES: Oh, really?

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:49.880
SAM ESMAIL: I think so.

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.330
CHRISTIAN SLATER: They're
looking to push the envelope.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:52.160
ALAN SEALES: Which I
think is wonderful.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:52.630
SAM ESMAIL: Yeah.

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:53.440
CHRISTIAN SLATER: Yeah.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.460
ALAN SEALES: Because
the show again,

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:56.810
this gets back to the
language in and the realism

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:57.720
of the whole thing.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.190
It pulls me in when
they're talking

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:01.500
like they would really talk.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:04.584
It's not again, while doing
the same Evil Corp stuff,

00:13:04.584 --> 00:13:05.250
but that fit in.

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:08.580
But, I'm to figure out
how to formulate this.

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:10.890
It works for the
show because it fits.

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:12.496
SAM ESMAIL: Yeah.

00:13:12.496 --> 00:13:14.620
ALAN SEALES: So I'm glad
that you're keeping it in.

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.745
Talk to the sensors, you
guys back there, good job.

00:13:16.745 --> 00:13:18.244
Keep it in.

00:13:18.244 --> 00:13:20.299
CHRISTIAN SLATER: Awesome.

00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:21.965
That's been the
greatest compliment too,

00:13:21.965 --> 00:13:24.740
to hear somebody who is
family technically savvy,

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:29.440
appreciating that it was handled
as accurately as possible.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:30.030
I love that.

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:31.238
ALAN SEALES: Well, thank you,

00:13:31.238 --> 00:13:33.590
CHRISTIAN SLATER: Yeah.

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:37.530
ALAN SEALES: Sam, what
else within the show

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:40.421
is more timely and culturally
resonant, do you think?

00:13:40.421 --> 00:13:42.170
Like where are we going
to see the show go

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:43.175
that makes more sense?

00:13:43.175 --> 00:13:44.550
SAM ESMAIL: Well,
you know again,

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:47.190
it's always about
people-- for me.

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:50.150
It's always been about
the character Elliott

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:52.760
and you know what he's
going to go through,

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:56.380
and how he's going to either
change the world or not.

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:59.030
But I think the
timely thing about it

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:03.056
is this revolutionary
spirit, that is coming about.

00:14:03.056 --> 00:14:04.680
And it has a lot to
do with technology.

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.770
It has a lot to do
with social media.

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:08.880
I mean, the whole Arab
Spring happened because

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:09.920
of Facebook and Twitter.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.570
And if GooglePlus
was around the time,

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:16.180
I'm sure would have
been on GooglePlus.

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:20.100
But anyway, like I think of
technology as drawing that out,

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:23.280
and I think beyond the
hacking part of it, which

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:28.310
like, let's face it, it is
kind of a superpower nowadays.

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:31.017
A bunch of hackers were
able to do destroy--

00:14:31.017 --> 00:14:32.600
CHRISTIAN SLATER:
Take down a company.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:37.870
SAM ESMAIL: Take down Sony
and the CEO had to step down.

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:39.727
That's a powerful thing.

00:14:39.727 --> 00:14:42.060
CHRISTIAN SLATER: He that
controls the internet controls

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:42.974
the world.

00:14:42.974 --> 00:14:45.140
ALAN SEALES: The Target and
the Home Depot and Sony.

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:47.060
SAM ESMAIL: And Obama
just got hacked.

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:50.020
So but beyond all
of that, I think

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:53.340
there is a positive thing
in that there is a way

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:57.300
to use technology to
really have change,

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.410
good, positive change happen.

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:03.980
And that to me is where I think
the show's relevance really

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:05.210
comes from.

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:06.110
ALAN SEALES: I agree.

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:08.651
So Christian, are you afraid to
go home and get on your Apple

00:15:08.651 --> 00:15:09.990
IIe now?

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:11.490
CHRISTIAN SLATER: A little bit.

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:12.770
Yeah, at times.

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:14.740
Yeah, I'm a little
bit more nervous.

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:16.615
And I change my passwords a lot.

00:15:16.615 --> 00:15:17.740
ALAN SEALES: Do you really?

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:19.489
CHRISTIAN SLATER: Oh,
yeah, yeah, why not?

00:15:19.489 --> 00:15:22.340
I mean it's just the way to go.

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:27.770
Because like everything
is on the internet.

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:31.170
On the one hand, it's fantastic.

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:34.066
Growing up, as far as
like dealing with finances

00:15:34.066 --> 00:15:35.940
and things like that,
this was like something

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:40.050
you'd have to hire a
team to work on, business

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:45.590
managers and now with my phone
and with these apps and things

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:47.900
like that, everything's
become so streamlined

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.130
I can carry it all with me.

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:52.250
But the danger is that
it's all out there.

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:54.980
ALAN SEALES: Right I
always wonder about that.

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:57.410
I guess no celebrities are safe.

00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:59.605
We had the big hacking
of the celebrities.

00:15:59.605 --> 00:16:00.980
CHRISTIAN SLATER:
Yes, actresses.

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:02.313
ALAN SEALES: So that was shown--

00:16:02.313 --> 00:16:03.564
CHRISTIAN SLATER: Sure.

00:16:03.564 --> 00:16:06.500
ALAN SEALES: So the pilot was
directed by Niels Arden Oplev.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:07.680
Did I say his name right?

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:08.388
SAM ESMAIL: Yeah.

00:16:08.388 --> 00:16:11.365
ALAN SEALES: So he worked on
"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."

00:16:11.365 --> 00:16:13.190
CHRISTIAN SLATER: He
directed that, right?

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:13.898
SAM ESMAIL: Yeah.

00:16:13.898 --> 00:16:16.100
ALAN SEALES: So it's
reflected in the episode,

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.420
that it's a very
direct cinematic feel.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.050
Did you set out writing that
writing the pilot with that

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:26.252
feel in mind or it it?

00:16:26.252 --> 00:16:27.960
SAM ESMAIL: The
initial-- so when I first

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:32.070
start writing the script, I
was writing it as a feature.

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:33.890
I'd never had
television experience.

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:35.640
I wasn't intending to
go into television.

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:39.350
So I started just writing
it was my next feature film.

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:43.300
And I got to the about page 90,
and I realized I wasn't even

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.630
like halfway through
act one, so this

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:48.310
was going to either be a really
long movie that would never

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:49.260
get made.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.390
Or I was like, I could
stop writing here.

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:52.900
And just turn it into a pilot.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.390
So I was like,
well, that's easier.

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:55.100
So I'll do that.

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:01.690
So it has that cinematic feel
because-- and by the way,

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:05.260
you know, when making the
show we're continuing that on

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.510
because there is an end,
like, I had an end in mind

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:10.079
when I was writing the feature.

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:11.970
And we're still building
towards that end.

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:13.760
So there's not
like a-- we're not

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.329
doing this procedural thing
of like hack of the week

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:17.291
or anything like that.

00:17:17.291 --> 00:17:19.040
There's a story that
were building toward.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.331
ALAN SEALES: It's a season arc.

00:17:20.331 --> 00:17:21.760
SAM ESMAIL: So
it's a series arc.

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.176
ALAN SEALES: Oh,
series arc, yeah.

00:17:23.176 --> 00:17:26.410
So it's a 10 episode season.

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:29.620
So that's kind of
unusual too, with cable.

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:31.305
Cable usually does 13 or more.

00:17:31.305 --> 00:17:32.680
SAM ESMAIL: You
know, it's funny.

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.620
So they wanted to
do thirt-- I don't

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:37.190
know if they wanted to do
13, but we were originally

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:39.830
budgeted for 13, I was the
one that wanted to do 10.

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:42.560
Because the naming--
this is how nerdy I am.

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:45.640
The naming convention
of every episode

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:50.540
is episode 1.0, 1.1, 1.2.

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:53.580
And the season finale is 1.9.

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:56.709
And then season two
would be 2.0 et cetera.

00:17:56.709 --> 00:17:59.000
And when they were, like,
well you don't want to do 13?

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.167
I'm like, well then it would
screw up the whole-- Well,

00:18:02.167 --> 00:18:02.750
then I can't--

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:03.820
ALAN SEALES: 1.12.

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:05.724
SAM ESMAIL: There would be 2.2.

00:18:05.724 --> 00:18:07.890
And then even this screwed
it up because episode one

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:11.940
is 1.0 and episode two is 1.1.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:13.397
And episode three is 1.2.

00:18:13.397 --> 00:18:15.480
And people were like,
getting so confused by that.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.390
ALAN SEALES: Techies, don't
because we start at zero.

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:18.560
SAM ESMAIL: Right, exactly.

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:19.900
And that's what I
kept saying to them.

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.691
They were like, what
are you talking about?

00:18:21.691 --> 00:18:23.410
Can't you just name it three?

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:26.142
Anyway, that's just
to give you a taste.

00:18:26.142 --> 00:18:27.590
But I kept it in there.

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:28.850
So we're all good.

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:30.690
ALAN SEALES: Good,
well, I appreciate you.

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:32.970
How did you get involved
with the project?

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:34.410
CHRISTIAN SLATER: Let's see.

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:36.020
I read the script.

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:40.495
I sat with you
and Nils and Chad.

00:18:40.495 --> 00:18:42.370
ALAN SEALES: How did
you even get the script?

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:43.800
CHRISTIAN SLATER: Agent.

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.290
Yeah, I guess you
guys reached out to--

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:47.520
SAM ESMAIL: We did.

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.670
CHRISTIAN SLATER: To
Darren, my agent and then

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:50.950
we all just got together.

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:55.020
And with everything, I'm
always a little nervous

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:56.990
and a little trepidatious
to start something.

00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:59.200
But we did sit down
and talk about it

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:04.600
and I had some insights into
the particular character

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.710
of Mr. Robot that I
wasn't sure were accurate.

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:11.950
But when I talked to Sam about
it, we both eye-to-eye on that

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:14.200
and I was thrilled with the
direction he was going in.

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.780
I think I did the same
thing that Elliott

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:19.380
does at the end of the pilot.

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:20.430
I threw my arms up.

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:21.650
I was like, cool.

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:22.890
That's where we're going?

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:23.590
Great.

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:24.520
I was really happy.

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:26.270
SAM ESMAIL: You've got
to remember, like so, I'm

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:27.936
writing this character
who's essentially

00:19:27.936 --> 00:19:32.520
this crazy, anarchist
guy, big character.

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.780
And "Pump Up the
Volume," happens.

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:38.870
You can't get much--
I mean it was perfect.

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:40.560
So with the fact
that he responded,

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:43.220
we were sort of over
the moon about that.

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:44.620
ALAN SEALES: That's awesome.

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:46.420
CHRISTIAN SLATER:
Yeah, it's fun.

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:47.420
I like to be anarchist--

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:48.770
SAM ESMAIL: He's still doing it.

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:50.895
CHRISTIAN SLATER: --and a
rebel and all that stuff.

00:19:50.895 --> 00:19:51.600
Can't let it go.

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.100
ALAN SEALES: What
are the challenges

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:56.485
of filming in New York,
external, exterior scenes.

00:19:56.485 --> 00:19:58.860
CHRISTIAN SLATER: For you
guys, you were in Times Square.

00:19:58.860 --> 00:19:59.520
SAM ESMAIL: Yeah,
that was a nightmare.

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:02.050
CHRISTIAN SLATER: There's a lot
of people like looking and--

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:05.930
ALAN SEALES: I was just
dissecting the Ferris wheels,

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:08.664
on the Wonder Wheel, to keep
continuity between all of that.

00:20:08.664 --> 00:20:09.830
SAM ESMAIL: Well, we didn't.

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:11.950
CHRISTIAN SLATER: That was
something Nils talked about.

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:14.325
SAM ESMAIL: But we didn't,
well, you know what we did do,

00:20:14.325 --> 00:20:15.575
we did the whole scene.

00:20:15.575 --> 00:20:17.280
And it would go around twice.

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.230
So we wouldn't cut.

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:20.130
We would just do the
whole scene straight.

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:21.505
CHRISTIAN SLATER:
Actually, yeah,

00:20:21.505 --> 00:20:24.280
in one of the first
meetings with Nils,

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:26.280
he did say that
yeah, he was going

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.710
to start the scene at the
start of the Ferris wheel

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:31.170
and then if I
messed up, we'd have

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:35.190
to go back to the
beginning and start again.

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:36.510
I was like, really?

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:38.011
OK.

00:20:38.011 --> 00:20:38.510
but?

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:40.770
Those are challenges
that sometimes

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:42.297
get presented to an actor.

00:20:42.297 --> 00:20:43.630
And you're like, all right, man.

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:44.900
You want to test me?

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:46.180
Fine.

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:50.620
And so I think we did it a
few times, which was great.

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:52.120
SAM ESMAIL: And can
I say something?

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.600
The server farm.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.099
Like I was like, oh, this
will be an easy location.

00:20:57.099 --> 00:20:58.265
The hardest location to get.

00:20:58.265 --> 00:20:58.790
CHRISTIAN SLATER: Oh, yeah.

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:00.530
SAM ESMAIL: We
asked you guys here.

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:03.987
Nobody would let us
bring a camera near it.

00:21:03.987 --> 00:21:05.070
CHRISTIAN SLATER: Near it?

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:05.500
SAM ESMAIL: Near it-- not even.

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:05.770
CHRISTIAN SLATER: Wow.

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:07.034
SAM ESMAIL: It was terrible.

00:21:07.034 --> 00:21:08.450
Yeah, people are
really protective

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:10.090
of their physical data.

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:11.465
CHRISTIAN SLATER:
Their database.

00:21:11.465 --> 00:21:12.700
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, yeah.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.262
Were there two cameramen in
the Ferris wheel with you?

00:21:15.262 --> 00:21:16.220
CHRISTIAN SLATER: Yeah.

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:17.640
SAM ESMAIL: Like you're
doing alternate shots.

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:20.181
CHRISTIAN SLATER: Yeah, I mean,
like that was the first scene

00:21:20.181 --> 00:21:21.042
that we shot.

00:21:21.042 --> 00:21:23.250
I mean it wasn't even like
on a shooting day, was it?

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:24.815
SAM ESMAIL: No, it
was like a pre-shoot.

00:21:24.815 --> 00:21:25.250
CHRISTIAN SLATER: Pre-shoot.

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:26.550
SAM ESMAIL: But it
was a good location.

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:27.610
CHRISTIAN SLATER:
And it was perfect.

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:29.440
And it was nice
that we were, first

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:34.320
of all, contained in a
very small, simple space.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:37.210
And you know, I mean,
it was Coney Island.

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:39.980
So it was beautiful
and it was easy.

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:42.280
And working with Rami was great.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.780
And I think was the right
way to sort of start off.

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:46.490
And it felt really, really good.

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:49.332
And I was certainly happy
like get it behind us.

00:21:49.332 --> 00:21:51.040
ALAN SEALES: Well,
what about the subway?

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.479
Like you just keep on
going in and eventually you

00:21:53.479 --> 00:21:54.770
get to the end and turn around?

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:55.110
SAM ESMAIL: Yeah.

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:55.180
CHRISTIAN SLATER: Yeah.

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:55.805
Where was that?

00:21:55.805 --> 00:21:58.492
SAM ESMAIL: That was in Brooklyn
on the Church Street stop.

00:21:58.492 --> 00:21:59.450
CHRISTIAN SLATER: Yeah.

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:00.810
ALAN SEALES: Are you guys
responsible for the delays

00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:01.590
that we felt?

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:03.142
[LAUGHING]

00:22:03.142 --> 00:22:04.474
CHRISTIAN SLATER: Probably.

00:22:04.474 --> 00:22:05.140
SAM ESMAIL: Because
your train had

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:06.740
to keep going back and forth.

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:08.250
CHRISTIAN SLATER: That's right.

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:09.990
But that actually
is an area, I guess,

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:12.804
which is not really
for public transport.

00:22:12.804 --> 00:22:14.345
I think it was more
of an abandoned--

00:22:14.345 --> 00:22:15.360
SAM ESMAIL: No, no, no.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:15.900
It was a real--

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:16.710
CHRISTIAN SLATER:
It's a real thing?

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:18.334
SAM ESMAIL: It's a
real subway station.

00:22:18.334 --> 00:22:20.150
CHRISTIAN SLATER: Oh, man.

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:20.910
I'm impressed.

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:22.370
ALAN SEALES: Was it in the
middle of the night, though?

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:23.560
Or at least not
during rush hour?

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:23.950
CHRISTIAN SLATER: No.

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:25.080
You know what was amazing?

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.200
It wasn't in the
middle of the night.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:27.060
It was during the day.

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.476
SAM ESMAIL: It was
during the day.

00:22:28.476 --> 00:22:30.960
Again, Nils, being
very cinematic

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:36.570
and wanting to get
long shots in one take,

00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:40.380
he really put the train
conductor through his paces.

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:42.930
Because he would have
to- like the train

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:46.045
would have to hit a
specific mark each time.

00:22:46.045 --> 00:22:46.920
ALAN SEALES: Oh, wow.

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:47.878
CHRISTIAN SLATER: Yeah.

00:22:47.878 --> 00:22:50.680
I mean, all I can do is take
my hat off to those dudes.

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:51.804
Because they kill it.

00:22:51.804 --> 00:22:53.220
SAM ESMAIL: They
really did, yeah.

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:55.470
CHRISTIAN SLATER: Had that
guy, had that conductor not

00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:58.160
had that skill, we
would still be there.

00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.550
Because that's how Nils was.

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:03.250
It's like if we didn't get it,
these guys hit it every time.

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:04.600
It was like, man, brilliant.

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.974
ALAN SEALES: So if anybody in
the audience has questions,

00:23:06.974 --> 00:23:09.855
come up to these two microphones
in the aisles, at any point,

00:23:09.855 --> 00:23:12.850
the ones with the lights
that like to just came up.

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:16.020
Or you could come and
talk into my test, which

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:17.140
would be awkward.

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:19.450
Christian, "Glass Menagerie,"
"Sideman," "Macbeth,"

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:21.700
"Music Man," TV, film,
God, your credits

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.480
go on forever. "Vampire," "Robin
Hood," "Prince of Thieves,"

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:27.010
"West Wing," "Archie,"
"Robot Chicken" voice-over,

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:30.480
Like your credits just
go on longer than mine.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.179
CHRISTIAN SLATER: OK.

00:23:32.179 --> 00:23:33.970
SAM ESMAIL: How does
this compare, how does

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:35.370
this role compare to the rest?

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:37.049
Like do you enjoy the character?

00:23:37.049 --> 00:23:38.090
Do you enjoy the subject?

00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:41.520
Do you enjoy the creator best?

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.550
CHRISTIAN SLATER: Yeah.

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:43.190
Sam is--

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.940
SAM ESMAIL: How
does it come down?

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:45.148
CHRISTIAN SLATER: --the best.

00:23:45.148 --> 00:23:50.050
And we'll look, right
now, it's a fun character

00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:52.090
to play because it's
probably-- well,

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:55.080
it's certainly different
for TV, comparatively

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:58.410
to other television projects
that I've been involved with.

00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:00.320
It's not like he
said, an episodic.

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.190
It is a great story.

00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:05.420
And this feels like--
television just kind of feels

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:11.610
like the new independent world,
in a way where you can really

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:15.320
hone a character and create
it and take your time.

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.100
And like he said,
we're continuing

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:22.110
to go with the very cinematic
feel as we shoot it.

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:24.200
ALAN SEALES: So the whole
season is the same--

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.070
CHRISTIAN SLATER: Same tone?

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:26.035
ALAN SEALES: Same one, yeah.

00:24:26.035 --> 00:24:27.170
CHRISTIAN SLATER: I think so.

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:27.878
SAM ESMAIL: Yeah.

00:24:27.878 --> 00:24:30.110
CHRISTIAN SLATER: He's
maintaining that consistently,

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:30.610
beautifully.

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:37.710
So look, like I said I
love the mysteriousness

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:38.750
of the character.

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:41.080
And I'm looking forward
to seeing where it goes.

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:45.210
I mean, it's definitely--
he's a very creative man

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:47.807
and I think there will be
some interesting surprises.

00:24:47.807 --> 00:24:49.640
SAM ESMAIL: He doesn't
know all the answers.

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:50.250
ALAN SEALES: Oh no?

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:50.850
CHRISTIAN SLATER: That's true.

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:52.000
SAM ESMAIL: It's all
up there, locked away?

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.583
CHRISTIAN SLATER:
It's all locked away

00:24:53.583 --> 00:24:54.810
in the safe between his ears.

00:24:54.810 --> 00:24:55.440
Yes.

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:58.359
ALAN SEALES: So you've-- you're
now a first time director?

00:24:58.359 --> 00:24:59.650
You've directed a few episodes?

00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:01.080
SAM ESMAIL: I directed
the second episode.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:02.420
ALAN SEALES: Oh, the second, OK.

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:03.580
So what was that like for you?

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:04.080
SAM ESMAIL: It was great.

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.020
I mean, I directed
a feature last year.

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:07.570
So it wasn't my
first time directing,

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:09.486
but it was my first time
directing television.

00:25:09.486 --> 00:25:12.580
And really is like
Christian said,

00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:15.700
it has that Indie
filmmaking kind of spirit.

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:18.610
Because you have
to go really fast.

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:20.550
There's not a lot of time.

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:23.770
There's not like every
resource known to man.

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:25.814
But we're also not
shooting a procedural,

00:25:25.814 --> 00:25:27.480
where you're just on
the set and there's

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.470
like 20 pages of dialogue.

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:31.775
We're doing a lot like
creative cinematic things.

00:25:31.775 --> 00:25:33.150
CHRISTIAN SLATER:
Like the angles

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:36.020
are very interesting
and the lighting.

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:37.612
And I'm really happy about that.

00:25:37.612 --> 00:25:39.820
ALAN SEALES: So do you don't
know everything of where

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:40.420
your character is going?

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:41.377
CHRISTIAN SLATER: No.

00:25:41.377 --> 00:25:42.960
ALAN SEALES: How
much knowledge do you

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.840
give him when he's
asking about the future,

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:48.280
how to play scenes
now in relating

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:49.652
to how it's going to play out?

00:25:49.652 --> 00:25:50.860
SAM ESMAIL: Well, I kind of--

00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:51.790
CHRISTIAN SLATER: He
gives me just enough.

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:52.498
SAM ESMAIL: Yeah.

00:25:52.498 --> 00:25:55.527
I kind of give him enough to
know what to do in the episode.

00:25:55.527 --> 00:25:58.110
ALAN SEALES: Is there a reason
to keep it to yourself, though?

00:25:58.110 --> 00:26:00.568
Like shouldn't the cast know
where their character's going?

00:26:00.568 --> 00:26:02.690
SAM ESMAIL: Well, there's
a lot of-- I don't know.

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:04.450
That's not necessarily
the best thing

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:06.486
to know, to know
where they end up.

00:26:06.486 --> 00:26:07.360
You know what I mean?

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:07.806
CHRISTIAN SLATER: You
don't want to give

00:26:07.806 --> 00:26:08.300
an actor too much information.

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:09.780
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:11.410
CHRISTIAN SLATER: You really
don't You really don't.

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:12.460
Like Woody Allen works--

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:15.710
SAM ESMAIL: No, he doesn't
even give them the script.

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:20.205
He gives them the pages of
the scene the day of the--

00:26:20.205 --> 00:26:21.974
ALAN SEALES: It's
kind of like I think

00:26:21.974 --> 00:26:23.140
"The Walking Dead" cast too.

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:25.910
They're like, yeah,
I didn't die today.

00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:27.420
CHRISTIAN SLATER: Yes.

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:28.570
SAM ESMAIL: Absolutely

00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:29.950
CHRISTIAN SLATER:
All right, man.

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:33.390
AUDIENCE: Thanks for having
it be very realistic,

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:35.380
including shooting in New York.

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:38.450
I was trying to find out what
trains that you guys are at.

00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:41.250
Before but on the
technical side,

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:43.550
I know that's what
drew me in too.

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:47.780
It was more accurate than 95%
of what's out there right now,

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:49.850
in terms of TV shows.

00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:50.490
Why is that?

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:52.490
What was the difference
that you guys go through

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:56.490
that every other show
just doesn't try to do?

00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:58.522
SAM ESMAIL: I mean
my personal theory--

00:26:58.522 --> 00:26:59.980
you're talking
about why they don't

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:03.250
do that, why other shows don't
do that or why we do that?

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:04.170
AUDIENCE: Well, yeah.

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:06.215
Why do you guys do that
and why do other's not?

00:27:06.215 --> 00:27:07.840
SAM ESMAIL: Because
I think it's corny.

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:11.820
When I watch these other
shows and they're like,

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:14.080
the one thing they
can think of is,

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.470
we have to grow
graphics at the person.

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:18.330
And they're like doing
this on the keyboard,

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:19.577
and they're like just--

00:27:19.577 --> 00:27:21.160
CHRISTIAN SLATER:
Inside the computer.

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.230
SAM ESMAIL: Yeah,
I don't get it.

00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:25.600
I'm m if you actually
do the real thing,

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.510
I think it's very compelling.

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:30.070
To me that's still
very compelling.

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:33.060
And also hacking is not just
about being on the keyboard.

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:35.260
There's a lot of
social engineering

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:37.570
that's involved in
trying to figure out

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:39.660
what a person's
password might be

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:44.430
or how to find the
hole in what they trust

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:49.780
to get inside their network or
their email or whatever it is.

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:52.550
So I honestly, I just find
it way more compelling

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:57.830
I don't find cheesy CGI graphics
that make no sense all that

00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:58.550
interesting.

00:27:58.550 --> 00:27:58.830
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:27:58.830 --> 00:27:59.330
Thank you.

00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:00.800
SAM ESMAIL: You're welcome.

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.620
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, question.

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:04.450
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
again a lot of fun.

00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:06.380
Thank you very much
for showing this.

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:09.340
One thing I was curious about
was with the subway scene,

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:12.000
the extent to which
your character is

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.790
like sort of explicitly
quoting and has

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:15.690
a relationship with like
other hacker movies,

00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:18.330
because it sounded a bit
almost like "The Matrix" scene,

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:20.740
like oh, I'm going to take
you to the Rabbit Hole

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:22.070
instead of to Brooklyn.

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:23.090
SAM ESMAIL: Yeah, yeah.

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:24.550
AUDIENCE: I'm curious to what
extent like your character

00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:27.222
sees that he's sort of quoting
some of this stuff or--

00:28:27.222 --> 00:28:27.930
SAM ESMAIL: Yeah.

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:30.675
AUDIENCE: --echoing it
on a more meta level.

00:28:30.675 --> 00:28:31.300
SAM ESMAIL: No.

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:31.800
I mean.

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.520
Meta, sure whatever.

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:35.750
Or you could say I just
ripped one of the lines off.

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:40.280
But because they are--
I'm a huge "Matrix" fan

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:42.757
and I always wanted to like--
there was always an homage--

00:28:42.757 --> 00:28:44.840
and I don't even know if
it's subconscious or not.

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:46.940
Because I feel like
I've forgotten if I did.

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:51.860
But there is one line in the
show, where he says something,

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:53.970
where it says in
the Ferris wheel,

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:56.570
there's something that control--
I can't quote the line,

00:28:56.570 --> 00:29:00.730
but I think it is what,
not Neil, Morpheus,

00:29:00.730 --> 00:29:01.990
it's what Morpheus says to--

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:04.110
CHRISTIAN SLATER: Yeah.

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:05.486
SAM ESMAIL: I swear that's it.

00:29:05.486 --> 00:29:05.986
I think.

00:29:05.986 --> 00:29:07.900
I think.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:10.005
But I'm just a big
fan of that movie.

00:29:10.005 --> 00:29:10.580
So I had to.

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:11.621
CHRISTIAN SLATER: Me too.

00:29:11.621 --> 00:29:12.140
Oh, gosh.

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:12.680
SAM ESMAIL: It's a great film.

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:13.080
CHRISTIAN SLATER: I love it.

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:13.700
I love it.

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:14.890
ALAN SEALES: One of
my favorite quotes

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:16.740
is, "money hasn't been
real since we got off

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:17.490
the gold standard.

00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:19.600
It's become virtual,
software, the operating

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:20.610
system of our world.

00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:22.950
We're on the verge of taking
down this virtual reality."

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:24.250
I love that one.

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:25.916
SAM ESMAIL: I'm pretty
sure that was me.

00:29:28.824 --> 00:29:29.740
ALAN SEALES: Question.

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:33.490
AUDIENCE: So you just picked
up on the social aspects

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:34.980
of hacking.

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:38.330
So the character is socially
awkward, on the one hand.

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:40.960
But on the other hand,
you put in those moments

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:43.960
where he is actually doing
social hacking or engineering

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:46.780
and he's asking his victim
for certain details, which

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:47.280
is great.

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:50.140
So there's really this
part where the character

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:52.600
is socially awkward, but
then when he hits his stride,

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:55.210
when he is in his element,
that just drops away.

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:56.530
He's doing the social hacking.

00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:58.550
He did that in the cafe
scene in the beginning.

00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:04.535
He did that later on with this
partner of a psychiatrist.

00:30:04.535 --> 00:30:05.910
Can you explain
a little bit more

00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:07.470
about how you wrote that in?

00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:09.610
SAM ESMAIL: So it's
about vulnerabilities,

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:14.670
which also another, I guess
technology term or hacker term.

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:17.890
So I think Elliot-- and I think
this is true again for people

00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:19.520
that I know who
are also hackers.

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:23.930
Like they are confident
when it comes to their work,

00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:26.640
less so when it comes
to being vulnerable,

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:30.010
showing something about who
they are, because that's

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:32.730
where their insecurities lie.

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:35.540
And honestly, it's
such a weird parallel

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:39.440
because that's the thing hackers
look for, vulnerabilities.

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:42.690
And that's the thing that
they always try and protect.

00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:45.630
So yeah, when he's
supremely confident,

00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:51.020
and he's like playing a
character to these people,

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:53.620
he can talk and
he can be social,

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:56.140
because he knows that he's
not having to open up.

00:30:56.140 --> 00:31:00.140
But when he's confronted with
Angela or Ollie or anybody

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:03.560
who wants to try and actually
get to know the real Eliot,

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:05.660
that's when he freezes
up and can't function.

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:10.210
ALAN SEALES: Well, we are
running short on time,

00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:13.150
so I'm going to wrap it up
soon unless nobody else has

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:13.960
any more questions.

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:17.000
I want to touch real quick
on the theme of women

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.050
in technology.

00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:20.230
Because you have
two very strong--

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:24.860
I assume Angela is
the do-gooder better.

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:27.682
And then we have Darlene
is the do-badder.

00:31:27.682 --> 00:31:28.390
SAM ESMAIL: Right

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:31.330
ALAN SEALES: So we have
two equally strong women

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:32.090
in technology.

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:33.632
Was that as that
on purpose as well?

00:31:33.632 --> 00:31:34.340
SAM ESMAIL: Yeah.

00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:36.006
ALAN SEALES: I mean,
Google specifically

00:31:36.006 --> 00:31:38.870
is trying to do a lot of public
outreach to do diversity.

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:41.500
SAM ESMAIL: And then we
have, in later episodes,

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:45.240
a Sheryl Sandberg-type
character that's coming up.

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:49.210
So it was done on purpose,
but not necessarily

00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:52.346
because I'm trying
to be more equal to--

00:31:52.346 --> 00:31:54.470
I didn't even consciously
think about it like that.

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:56.660
I think that's just
life right now.

00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:57.960
There are female hackers.

00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:00.270
There are females in technology.

00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:04.657
So I just thought, make this
as authentic as possible.

00:32:04.657 --> 00:32:06.240
And this was part
of the authenticity.

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:06.620
ALAN SEALES: Cool.

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:07.120
All right.

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:10.480
So lastly then, if
you could summarize

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:13.104
for everybody-- everybody
who's in technology, of course,

00:32:13.104 --> 00:32:13.770
is to love this.

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:16.269
But for everybody who isn't,
what's going to appeal to them?

00:32:16.269 --> 00:32:18.360
Why should they watch this?

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:20.030
SAM ESMAIL: You want
me want to do that?

00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:20.620
CHRISTIAN SLATER:
No, you can start.

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:22.119
SAM ESMAIL: You're
Christian Slater.

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:30.120
I would say, you
know, look, at the end

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:33.210
of the day, whether it's about
hacking or cops or lawyers

00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:35.980
or whatever, at the end
the day, it's about people.

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:38.330
And I think if someone's
going to watch this,

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:40.090
it's because they like Elliot.

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:42.620
They relate to
him on some level.

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:43.840
They relate to Mr. Robot.

00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:46.284
They get enjoyment out
of him on some level.

00:32:46.284 --> 00:32:48.700
They know a crazy uncle who's
like-- You know what I mean?

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:51.540
That's sort of what
happens, is that

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:54.280
your personal-- the
characters come off as

00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:55.900
real people in your life.

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:56.650
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:32:56.650 --> 00:32:58.524
I think it helps too,
to that point, that you

00:32:58.524 --> 00:33:00.957
make so many references
to real things

00:33:00.957 --> 00:33:02.540
that everyone can
relate to something.

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:05.920
Like, I like "Hunger Games"
and I own a BlackBerry.

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:07.184
So everybody's got something.

00:33:07.184 --> 00:33:08.350
SAM ESMAIL: Or I hate Apple.

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:10.016
ALAN SEALES: I hate--
I didn't say that.

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:15.132
Any, yeah, so if nobody
has any more questions,

00:33:15.132 --> 00:33:15.840
we'll wrap it up.

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:17.860
Please everybody, put
your hands together

00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:20.124
for Sam Esmail and
Christian Slater.

00:33:20.124 --> 00:33:21.040
SAM ESMAIL: Thank you.

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.682
CHRISTIAN SLATER: Thank you.

00:33:22.682 --> 00:33:25.090
ALAN SEALES: "Mr. Robot"
premieres Wednesday,

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:28.880
June 24 on USA, 10:00 PM
Eastern, 9:00 Central,

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:30.010
#mrrobot.

00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:30.870
Go out and watch it.

00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:31.619
Tell your friends.

00:33:31.619 --> 00:33:34.180
[APPLAUSE]
