So, here I am in the Python documentation for OS and let me just search

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.470
for something that can help us rename a file. Lo and behold, there is a rename

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.820
function we could use. It takes the source or the current name of the file and

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.690
changes it to the destination or the new

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.710
name of the file. Let's use this function.
