00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.780
know 1979 80 81
right so and those of them those who

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790
right so and those of them those who
 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.539
right so and those of them those who
were born here or abroad would all be in

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549
were born here or abroad would all be in
 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.170
were born here or abroad would all be in
their late 20s or you know like me maybe

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180
their late 20s or you know like me maybe
 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.009
their late 20s or you know like me maybe
born in Iran but then they came here at

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019
born in Iran but then they came here at
 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.580
born in Iran but then they came here at
a young age so they can fall into the -

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590
a young age so they can fall into the -
 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.869
a young age so they can fall into the -
it phenomenon so this is a young group

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879
it phenomenon so this is a young group
 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.649

of artists but there's a lot of urgency
I think and as the political climate

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019
I think and as the political climate
 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.050
I think and as the political climate
grows more and more precarious I think

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060
grows more and more precarious I think
 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.349
grows more and more precarious I think
they've had felt a need to but their art

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359
they've had felt a need to but their art
 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.720
they've had felt a need to but their art
out there but in like I said in a very

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730
out there but in like I said in a very
 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.670
out there but in like I said in a very
different way than the previous

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680
different way than the previous
 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.809

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.449
generation who you know we're coming out
with works in the 80s and 90s the

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459
with works in the 80s and 90s the
 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.309
with works in the 80s and 90s the

so I think that can sometimes create

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319
so I think that can sometimes create
 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:12.410
so I think that can sometimes create
compromised art
