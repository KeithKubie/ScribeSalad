environment allows these new ideas to
 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.359
environment allows these new ideas to
emerge well not everybody is qualified

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369
emerge well not everybody is qualified
 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.170

technical breakthroughs I believe today

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590
technical breakthroughs I believe today
 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.420
technical breakthroughs I believe today
that is the key to progress and once we

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430
that is the key to progress and once we
 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.070
that is the key to progress and once we
have those breakthroughs then we need to

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080
have those breakthroughs then we need to
 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.810
have those breakthroughs then we need to
wrap them with management and have

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820
wrap them with management and have
 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.890
wrap them with management and have
managed execution talent in those are

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900

all entrepreneurial opportunities pretty

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060
all entrepreneurial opportunities pretty
 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.819
all entrepreneurial opportunities pretty
much for anybody who can contribute to

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829

I believe environmentalist like to talk

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:43.980
I believe environmentalist like to talk
 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.760
I believe environmentalist like to talk
about that I don't believe that is the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770
about that I don't believe that is the
 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.090
about that I don't believe that is the
key to solving this problem clearly it

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100
key to solving this problem clearly it
 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.210
key to solving this problem clearly it
helps if people are using less fuel

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220
helps if people are using less fuel
 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.859
helps if people are using less fuel
clearly ill it helps if they're using

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869
clearly ill it helps if they're using
 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.270
clearly ill it helps if they're using
less energy but I think technical

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280
less energy but I think technical
 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.350
less energy but I think technical
breakthroughs will be the key to

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360
breakthroughs will be the key to
 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.410
breakthroughs will be the key to
cracking the oil and coal problems now

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420
cracking the oil and coal problems now
 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.770
cracking the oil and coal problems now
we should spend some time on call
