1
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.890
[inaudible] two one, boom. Hotep Jesus, how are you sir?

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.480
I was wanting to say that you want to call somebody that I need that drunk.

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.200
How the fuck do you get a name like hotep Jesus. How'd that come about?

4
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.920
It wasn't my idea. You know, I was a, I had just went through my,

5
00:00:16.921 --> 00:00:18.120
a spiritual awakening.

6
00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:21.150
I just thought the hip hop industry and I went through like that mace thing,

7
00:00:21.151 --> 00:00:23.820
you know, you go to church, you doing with the headgear. What? We got you a lot.

8
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.560
A lot going on up there. I had to top my head down. It's a black thing.

9
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.630
So you had a spiritual awakening. I had this spiritual awakening and um,

10
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.040
you know, tweeting on Twitter like I do, right? And uh, somebody said,

11
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.300
what do you think you are some kind of hotep Jesus. Ooh, Ooh,

12
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.640
yes, I do think I'm hotep Jesus. That's perfect. And now you own it.

13
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.830
That person is probably like, Fuck God. Damn, that was a great name.

14
00:00:52.831 --> 00:00:53.820
I gave that dude. Yeah.

15
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.410
I don't know who that person is or was or where they are now.

16
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.560
Shout out to whoever you are and vibe. Hi, you're Twitter.

17
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.860
Why didn't you switch it to hotep? Jesus, can you switch it? Ah.

18
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.930
Does anybody own a hotep? Jesus, I do.

19
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.860
You so you have hotep Jesus on Twitter too. Yeah, I reserved it. Oh Dude.

20
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.940
I think they could probably swap.

21
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.920
Do you have a little cute little blue check marks yet? No.

22
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.920
To put the fuck is that? How do you get one of those?

23
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.090
I don't know this and people,

24
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.550
there's some people that have those that have like a thousand followers.

25
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.080
How are you getting it?

26
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.240
Like if you worked for the New York Times or some shit go,

27
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.500
I'll do Joe and then I get verified. Right?

28
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.550
They know how Twitter feels about me. I mean, I think Jack likes me.

29
00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:35.500
He's been in a couple of times, but I think the whole, they're,

30
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.940
they're weird man. They weren't, I mean I think all social media,

31
00:01:38.941 --> 00:01:42.060
all tech companies want you to toe a line right now.

32
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.230
And if you're not towing that line and you're bringing on forbidden guests and

33
00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:49.140
you have people that have controversial ideas, you know,

34
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.750
they'll have that finger on the button of getting rid of you.

35
00:01:51.751 --> 00:01:55.920
They don't know what to do. It's just like radio, you know, like radio.

36
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.710
A lot of people don't know.

37
00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.610
But radio has to play happy songs because happy people buy things. Yeah,

38
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.620
that's what, that's what the study say. Allegedly.

39
00:02:04.621 --> 00:02:07.680
The Marketing Studies and advertising studies say people who are in a good mood

40
00:02:07.681 --> 00:02:08.640
tend to buy things, right.

41
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.420
So the radio is supposed to play happy songs all day long and the radio works

42
00:02:14.431 --> 00:02:17.610
for the advertisers, kind of like media and so on, so forth.

43
00:02:17.611 --> 00:02:20.340
So social media is no different. You have advertisers.

44
00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:25.320
So if there's people on the platform who are creating disgruntled crowds,

45
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.960
it could be hurting the bottom line. Yeah.

46
00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:31.800
But Facebook's algorithm actually favors that. The way Facebook has it set up.

47
00:02:31.801 --> 00:02:33.720
Like say if, if you, uh,

48
00:02:33.721 --> 00:02:36.630
if you get into debates with people on abortion or something like very

49
00:02:36.631 --> 00:02:40.950
controversial, they will start sending that shit to your feet. They will,

50
00:02:40.951 --> 00:02:42.480
they will prop it, will,

51
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.410
they'll sort of steer it in your direction because the more you engage,

52
00:02:46.411 --> 00:02:48.420
the more clicks they get, the more money they get,

53
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.980
the more advertising dollars again. Absolutely. Absolutely. Uh,

54
00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.170
the Facebook algorithm is quite unique and, uh,

55
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.830
the way that things can go viral there. Um, Twitter, I feel like,

56
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.500
did the Twitter safety and counsel board, what do they call it?

57
00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:08.110
Trust and safety. Is that what it's called? Something like that? Yeah.

58
00:03:08.111 --> 00:03:12.040
So when I go and look at the entities that contribute to that board,

59
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:17.020
I kind of start saying, oh, okay, I see why certain topics are taboo. You know?

60
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.650
Um, there's, and when you, when there's a board,

61
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.930
those people on the board are the voice. They're the ones that have the opinion,

62
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.810
you know? So if your group isn't represented,

63
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.390
maybe you need to figure out how to get on that board. You know what I mean?

64
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.200
Right. I don't know.

65
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.340
Anybody's getting on that board is not going to happen and you'd better be left

66
00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:39.220
wing if you're going to get on that board. I don't think there's any. Right.

67
00:03:39.221 --> 00:03:43.810
What do you think like is I think Jack's more like in the middle.

68
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.810
Yes. I think he's closer to the middle. I don't think it's Jack. I think it's,

69
00:03:46.811 --> 00:03:49.550
you know, Jack's working on a bunch of different projects. Um,

70
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.660
but I think it's probably, you know,

71
00:03:52.661 --> 00:03:56.920
whoever else is in the office making the day to day decisions. Yeah,

72
00:03:56.921 --> 00:03:58.000
I liked it a lot,

73
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.420
but I think jack is in the middle of a gigantic corporation and there's so many

74
00:04:03.881 --> 00:04:06.340
people with so many ideas. Essentially

75
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.720
the founding fathers of our country had a great idea when it comes to freedom of

76
00:04:10.721 --> 00:04:11.554
expression.

77
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.120
They felt like it was very important that you have free speech and they don't,

78
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.070
you can't be silenced. You can't be,

79
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.000
you can't be undermined by people who disagree with you because it's dangerous.

80
00:04:22.001 --> 00:04:26.170
It's dangerous when someone can just decide that you can't have a voice anymore

81
00:04:26.171 --> 00:04:27.490
and only their voice can be heard.

82
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.960
And we're kind of seeing that with Twitter and we're kind of seeing that with

83
00:04:31.961 --> 00:04:33.360
Facebook and with Google and their,

84
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.800
they're deciding what could be heard and what not can be heard.

85
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.540
They think they're doing it for good reasons.

86
00:04:37.541 --> 00:04:40.870
They think they're doing it to preserve our culture and our civilization and

87
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.830
they want to protect people from the election. Read it. Shut down the Donald,

88
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.990
the uh, the, the Donald Trump support a reddit page. Yeah.

89
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:51.640
That's not a good idea.

90
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.590
That right and right before the dem dem to be right before the democratic debate

91
00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.210
and you know, that was like where all the funny memes come from and look man,

92
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.970
this, you can't do that. I mean,

93
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.200
just because if you have some people that are saying some shit that's bad on

94
00:05:08.201 --> 00:05:10.330
there, get rid of those people. Get rid of that.

95
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.160
But you can't just shut down a whole forum. Like it seems, that seems insane.

96
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.360
Is there a reason for it and you kind of shut down and says it's quarantine.

97
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.930
Where fuck does that mean, does it have a disease for like temporary,

98
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.970
it's got Ebola, it's happens to people.

99
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.040
They got to do something that says there's violent threats.

100
00:05:27.041 --> 00:05:31.300
I'm looking to see what repeated misbehavior. Violent threats.

101
00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.550
Let's see. Skeptical. Very. It seems weird, right?

102
00:05:36.551 --> 00:05:39.750
I feel like all of this stuff isn't it?

103
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.650
Like we're seeing what the first amendment is really all about,

104
00:05:44.651 --> 00:05:48.370
why it exists. We're seeing it play out with all these social media sites.

105
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.190
I really think that, you know, my thing is with like the right thing, right?

106
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.830
It's very easy to create an actor, right?

107
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.040
The left can create a right wing actor online to pretend like it's

108
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.310
<v 1>something out. Sure. It's something else. They can go in and read it,</v>

109
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.960
do something malicious to get the whole reddit band right or an agent

110
00:06:05.961 --> 00:06:09.110
provocateur. Yeah, exactly. And uh,

111
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.920
I never leave that off the table. When I look at instances like this,

112
00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.950
when you say, oh, somebody was, it's the internet, everybody is anonymous,

113
00:06:15.951 --> 00:06:18.920
you know, tracking this back to who it is, you know what I mean?

114
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.350
Or do you know what's conservative? Do you know as a Republican? Are you sure?

115
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:23.930
So, you know, I take these things,

116
00:06:23.931 --> 00:06:27.590
these pieces of information with a grain of salt. Yeah, you should.

117
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.760
But is this election meddling? It kind of is, right?

118
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.690
Is what it feels like. If you're killing a whole sub, what it does, it depends.

119
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.160
I mean, so if they're really,

120
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.460
that would be really interesting if it turns out that it was someone from the

121
00:06:40.461 --> 00:06:44.780
left that was posing as someone from the right in order to shut down a forum and

122
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.380
pretend there's death threats or, I mean, you look at Youtube, right?

123
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:52.880
And what's been happening with youtube? Even just the algorithm, you know, uh,

124
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.490
I'm pretty good with keywords. I do SEO Marketing,

125
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.480
so when I type in certain keywords or find certain things,

126
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.540
I know what's gonna come up or what type of content comes up.

127
00:07:02.541 --> 00:07:07.090
Now when I type in those keywords, it's like ABC, NBC, ABC, see a dad.

128
00:07:07.091 --> 00:07:08.570
And I'm like, that's not what I wanted.

129
00:07:08.571 --> 00:07:11.930
They don't even talk about these keywords. What are you talking about? You know?

130
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.000
So when you start seeing that,

131
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.510
you start thinking about ink soc in Orwell in 1984,

132
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:22.870
socialism and communism and fascism and the degradation of society and,

133
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:29.270
um, a lot of control coming down. Um, you know,

134
00:07:29.271 --> 00:07:32.870
people, you know, in some ways it's like,

135
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.290
was the internet created for freedom or was it country created for control?

136
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.040
Right? So it's two different pathways. We could probably look at that,

137
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:45.070
but it seems like in many ways they set us up to be controlled and they're doing

138
00:07:47.811 --> 00:07:48.770
it through monopolies.

139
00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:54.020
Google controls search through youtube and Google.

140
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:58.550
And by what you search, you can think it's a truth. But what did Kanye say?

141
00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:02.470
Kanye say Google lied to you. You know, so I'm trying.

142
00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:05.960
He says a lot of crazy shit though. You got to really think about that. He does.

143
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:09.650
And I like crazy. I do too. I'm a big fan of crazy. I'm a little crazy.

144
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.300
A lot of crazy sometimes,

145
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:16.250
so I appreciate his crazy side more than his calm side. Well,

146
00:08:16.251 --> 00:08:20.210
great things come from wild thoughts. Right? Exactly.

147
00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:25.120
I think the Internet was initially created to exchange information and then one,

148
00:08:25.121 --> 00:08:28.700
it got loose to the general public. They realized what a crazy idea that was.

149
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:32.240
What I think we're seeing right now with the algorithms is that these

150
00:08:32.241 --> 00:08:34.790
corporations are influencing these companies to say, hey,

151
00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:38.180
when someone's looking for these things, how about you send them over to ABC?

152
00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:40.430
How about you send them over to NBC? How about you? You know,

153
00:08:40.431 --> 00:08:44.210
like we want to be able to get the first views on these things.

154
00:08:44.211 --> 00:08:46.880
So if someone's searching for that, I don't know how they do it.

155
00:08:46.881 --> 00:08:49.700
I don't know what they are, whether they have agreements with them, maybe.

156
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.780
I mean there's also a lot of copywritten shit that's on there that could get

157
00:08:53.781 --> 00:08:57.420
youtube in some significant trouble if they have a really decided to pursue it.

158
00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:57.810
Right.

159
00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:01.140
And how many videos are on youtube that people have on their channel that are

160
00:09:01.141 --> 00:09:06.030
just straight off of Fox News or NBC News or there's a lot of like copyright

161
00:09:06.031 --> 00:09:10.320
protected content that Youtube is essentially profiting off of. Oh yeah,

162
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:13.080
yeah. They make a ton of money off that stuff. Yeah.

163
00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:17.430
So they might have deals where they say, look, we'll send these people to,

164
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.590
you know, this first. Yeah. And that's why I say, you know,

165
00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:23.070
and that's where the control comes in. You know, the advertisers,

166
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:28.100
advertisers are the ones paying, you know, for the platform to a thing.

167
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:32.550
It's not us to users that are paying for youtube spree. So who's paying, right?

168
00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.860
Yeah. They're there. They're monetizing us.

169
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:38.190
They're monetizing us to users and the viewers. Yeah.

170
00:09:38.191 --> 00:09:39.540
That's where it gets tricky, right?

171
00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:43.050
Because as soon as the advertisers get on board, they said, look, we uh,

172
00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:47.610
you know, we want to give you money but this content is not advertiser friendly.

173
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:52.440
Right. And then they start moving stuff around and demonetizing things and,

174
00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:56.310
and with demonetization, the real thing that they're doing in a lot of ways,

175
00:09:56.311 --> 00:10:00.060
whether it's intentional or not, is you're influencing what people post.

176
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:04.560
You're kind of, you're asking them to self censor. Cause if you say, hey,

177
00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:08.430
you guys want to discuss abortion rights or you know, like there's,

178
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.520
there's some things that you start discussing them and they will automatically

179
00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.410
dump demonetize you. Yeah.

180
00:10:13.411 --> 00:10:18.310
Well who is the girl that put out the a abortion documentary. Right. And they,

181
00:10:18.311 --> 00:10:21.450
each girl snatched that down. I forget what it's called. Um,

182
00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:23.280
I'm bad at memorizing these things,

183
00:10:23.281 --> 00:10:28.140
but there was an a basically an anti abortion thing that exposed some things

184
00:10:28.141 --> 00:10:31.350
about abortion as a documentary and I believe that day it went up,

185
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:34.380
it got shut down. She had a re uploaded. Um, what's that?

186
00:10:34.381 --> 00:10:36.870
Lauren southern might've been, yeah,

187
00:10:36.871 --> 00:10:40.530
there's those two cute white chicks that everybody thinks are super racist.

188
00:10:40.531 --> 00:10:45.090
Lauren southern and Tammy, Tammy, Lauren, Tomi Lahren, Tommy Lauren.

189
00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:47.640
So she did a documentary, but then you have like a,

190
00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:49.450
the James O'Keefe thing where you know,

191
00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:53.610
he put up the exposing youtube and then that got, you know,

192
00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.520
obviously they're going to take it down for the most recent one to expose

193
00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:01.320
Google. Right, right. Yeah, I've been asking people about that. I'm like, okay,

194
00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.490
break this down for me.

195
00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:05.910
Is there any way that this could have been deceptively advertised or deceptively

196
00:11:05.911 --> 00:11:07.120
edited? Like it's,

197
00:11:07.121 --> 00:11:12.121
it seems to me like they're saying that they're going to manipulate search

198
00:11:12.481 --> 00:11:16.470
results and they're gonna manipulate the way people see things because of the

199
00:11:16.471 --> 00:11:20.100
2016 election. They don't want that happening again in 2020.

200
00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:22.350
That's what it seems. What I'm looking at it absolutely.

201
00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.170
That's exactly it looks like could it be doctorate? Of course. Good. You know,

202
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:28.770
that's, that's, that's always possible. But um,

203
00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:33.210
when you go and experience it for yourself, like what I was talking about with,

204
00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:37.230
you know, doing a keyword search, you start seeing the parallels.

205
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:43.090
Um, and then, you know, uncle Hotep, you know, he is, his channel was, you know,

206
00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:46.680
doing great and then the algorithm flipped and they see no,

207
00:11:46.681 --> 00:11:48.570
like he wasn't making the same money anymore.

208
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:53.140
So it's like I don't have to go to some doctor video or whatever video to

209
00:11:53.141 --> 00:11:54.400
understand his problem.

210
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.310
<v 2>The people around me are being affected by it. You know,</v>

211
00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:01.450
is this as a primary source? I don't have to look at some money internet. Um,

212
00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.030
but I don't know. It's, it's

213
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:10.180
in a way I don't like playing victim with the topic. Right.

214
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.440
Steer Platform. Do what you want with it. We choose to be there.

215
00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:19.750
We don't have to be, there does not another game in town though. It's not,

216
00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.240
it's weird, right? When you think about how big the Internet is,

217
00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:26.470
and there's only one youtube, right? And Vimeo and all those other ones,

218
00:12:26.471 --> 00:12:30.850
they're great. But well, you know, I always related to the black community,

219
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.310
you know, the black community always say, oh, you know, white people,

220
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:35.290
this white people that white people, this white people would ask,

221
00:12:35.291 --> 00:12:37.930
they're not giving us opportunity. And it's always like, well,

222
00:12:37.931 --> 00:12:41.230
is that the only opportunity? Can you not create your own opportunity?

223
00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:45.520
You know what I mean? So I never want to take a victim mentality and say, Oh,

224
00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:48.880
you know, let's take Google with a court, you know, all this stuff. It's like,

225
00:12:48.881 --> 00:12:52.090
if you want to do that, that's fine. That's not how I'm looking at this.

226
00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.930
I'm looking at it longterm, like hooking up with Andrew Torb over at gap,

227
00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:59.620
you know what I mean? And building tools. So, you know, we do a,

228
00:12:59.621 --> 00:13:04.560
the coin bid app.com and uh, creators can actually, um, it's,

229
00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.100
it's based upon approval right now,

230
00:13:06.101 --> 00:13:09.730
but creators can go on there and receive bitcoin as a donation, you know,

231
00:13:09.731 --> 00:13:13.090
so we're circumventing the things that happen like with the d platforming at

232
00:13:13.091 --> 00:13:17.020
Patriot, right? And the other payment platforms for creators.

233
00:13:17.021 --> 00:13:20.560
So we're creating tools to circumvent these things. So that's how I look at it.

234
00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:25.330
I'm like, oh, Google's doing this great. This is a great opportunity here.

235
00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:30.070
Let me seize it and let me build it. And B, you know, the alternative, you know,

236
00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.050
I love to see that. Um,

237
00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:36.490
is the alternative going to be Youtube and as popular? Of course not,

238
00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.510
it's just not, but it's still a viable option.

239
00:13:40.511 --> 00:13:43.150
You can still communicate with your people.

240
00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.910
The number one communication tool for an influencer, what their,

241
00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:50.440
what their a community is. Email, build your email list, right?

242
00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:54.250
People still subscribe to your email list, right? That's not youtube,

243
00:13:54.251 --> 00:13:57.220
that's not Google. That's your email list. That's your contact list.

244
00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.160
So it's like you can complain about youtube or Google,

245
00:14:00.161 --> 00:14:02.920
but you can build your audience almost anywhere.

246
00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.930
It depends on how powerful you are.

247
00:14:04.931 --> 00:14:08.380
Are you powerful enough to convince people to come to this other platform or to

248
00:14:08.381 --> 00:14:09.280
wherever you are?

249
00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:12.910
A lot of people are powerful enough to pack a room at $2,000 a ticket.

250
00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:15.970
You tell me you can't get somebody to go to another platform for free.

251
00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:19.900
Who charges $2,000 a ticket. Uh, I mean a lot of these speakers, you know,

252
00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:23.590
like the Tony robins type cats, he charges 2000 bucks.

253
00:14:23.591 --> 00:14:26.280
I think Charles like 10 yeah, I think,

254
00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:28.380
I think some of his stuff is like 10 yeah.

255
00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:32.890
But he's doing like these week long events where everybody gets together.

256
00:14:32.891 --> 00:14:36.150
I'm going to turn to your Lord doing karate kicks session

257
00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:41.080
when you, well, that's how you get the biggest check.

258
00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:43.420
You got to create a bigger experience. So it's like, all right,

259
00:14:43.421 --> 00:14:46.480
so we'll do it one day at two k right? It's like, well, how do I get 10 k?

260
00:14:46.481 --> 00:14:49.630
It's like, well, let's just extend it for the week and you know, add like,

261
00:14:49.631 --> 00:14:52.070
you know, the kickboxing class, you know, we'll

262
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:55.190
<v 0>chat in a sauna. You just, you know, create that part of marketing, you know.</v>

263
00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:58.820
Um, but yeah, I'm not complaining about these tech companies,

264
00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:02.960
these tech companies. Man, I'm not scared of these dudes, man. He did.

265
00:15:02.961 --> 00:15:06.830
The content is us. The content is certainly us. And like I get,

266
00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:12.130
what I got from talking to Jack and vigil was it's almost impossible to manage a

267
00:15:13.071 --> 00:15:16.700
site like that. The just the influx of not like I used to have a,

268
00:15:16.701 --> 00:15:18.110
a message board on my website.

269
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:20.930
One of the things that I noticed before we shut it down was I was getting

270
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:26.350
thousands and thousands of Russian emails that were signing up for my website.

271
00:15:28.131 --> 00:15:30.920
This is what you remember that Jamie, this is years ago.

272
00:15:30.921 --> 00:15:34.670
This is like three years ago. Okay. Jaime and fucking fat,

273
00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:38.840
like tens of thousands of Russian email addresses.

274
00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:42.740
We're signing up like similar addresses. It was something like the Ira,

275
00:15:42.741 --> 00:15:44.300
something like the Internet research agency,

276
00:15:44.301 --> 00:15:48.260
which does that which is responsible for all those fake pages on Facebook and

277
00:15:48.261 --> 00:15:49.760
Google and Instagram and all that shit.

278
00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:55.090
And they were signing up for websites and that had message boards and then they

279
00:15:55.281 --> 00:15:58.270
would jump on and pretend that they were whatever the fuck they were. Right.

280
00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:00.440
Pretend that they were a social justice warrior,

281
00:16:00.441 --> 00:16:03.740
pretend that there was black lives matter and they just start fights,

282
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:07.030
start arguments. And it was like, wow, this is fascinating. And then when it,

283
00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:10.790
when it also happened and that it happened with Facebook and it became a big

284
00:16:10.791 --> 00:16:11.780
part of the election,

285
00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:16.160
you realize like this is like a concerted effort to use these platforms to

286
00:16:16.161 --> 00:16:19.030
wiggle. So when your jack or your, whoever runs,

287
00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:22.280
you have to look at that and go, okay, hello. Fuck, do we manage that?

288
00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:23.780
I mean if we're in a free speech,

289
00:16:23.781 --> 00:16:27.710
we should just let these people manipulate everybody. Let it be wild, wild west.

290
00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:28.580
How can, I mean,

291
00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:33.580
it's when you have these people that are working for the Russians or even people

292
00:16:34.521 --> 00:16:36.380
that are working on the left that are trying, I mean,

293
00:16:36.381 --> 00:16:38.900
if there really is someone that's doing that to the Donald,

294
00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:43.400
a subreddit on Reddit, what do you do?

295
00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.030
If you're in the free speech, you're supposed to allow that, right?

296
00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.210
You could just create a metric, you know, or,

297
00:16:48.211 --> 00:16:52.850
or some sort of mechanism that red flags in account publicly. Right.

298
00:16:52.851 --> 00:16:55.130
But I think this is where it gets slippery, right?

299
00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.460
Because then you're talking about an algorithm,

300
00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.560
you're talking about manipulating search results.

301
00:17:00.561 --> 00:17:03.350
You're talking about not that route. What I'm saying, I mean, not that rough,

302
00:17:03.351 --> 00:17:04.550
but this is where it goes, right?

303
00:17:04.551 --> 00:17:09.080
If you just keep managing the content instead of like someone like, like Gab,

304
00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:12.770
where they just let the content flow free. But obviously you go there,

305
00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:16.550
there's a lot of dumpster fires, man. It's like fucking chaos or do that.

306
00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:20.540
Oh yeah. Absolutely not is going to be perfect. Right. You know, um,

307
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:24.560
I think whenever you see a bad, that's good, right?

308
00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:28.180
Oh yeah. Uh, bad is a, a,

309
00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:31.670
a portal to good. It is, uh,

310
00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:36.970
an opportunity to fix something because at some point that problem was going to

311
00:17:38.301 --> 00:17:42.890
emerge, right? It just emerged now. So it's like, Oh wow, okay,

312
00:17:42.891 --> 00:17:45.980
here's this problem. The solution, every problem lies within the problem.

313
00:17:45.981 --> 00:17:47.660
So technically there is no problem.

314
00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:50.160
So let's just go ahead and solve this problem and we'll want to the next

315
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.790
<v 2>one. You know? But I love problems. I love solving problems.</v>

316
00:17:53.791 --> 00:17:57.390
I think it's really fun. Uh, so when I see a problem, I go, hmm, okay, let's,

317
00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:00.360
let's think about this. And sometimes it's not a one person job, you know,

318
00:18:00.361 --> 00:18:03.210
it's a whole committee and a whole bunch of minds have to get together.

319
00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:06.720
So when I look at the conservative community, I think about like, you know,

320
00:18:06.721 --> 00:18:11.220
aren't you have all these minds but are your minds working to complain or your

321
00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:13.260
mind's working to solve the problem.

322
00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:16.740
And it seems like the minds aren't working to solve the problem,

323
00:18:16.741 --> 00:18:19.770
to work in a complaint, right? So, for example, um,

324
00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:24.810
during the early 20th century or early 19 hundreds is do with this newspaper

325
00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:28.910
super-popular in New York. And, uh, he puts some, uh,

326
00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:33.480
an inflammatory things about a certain family in New York City. And, uh,

327
00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.630
all the department stores boycott the newspapers. He has no advertisers.

328
00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:39.000
So they did that to put him out of business.

329
00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:44.480
And this gentleman takes the space and gives it to the proletariat or the,

330
00:18:44.821 --> 00:18:47.310
you know, small business guys in the area.

331
00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:50.340
And he gives them full front page ads, right?

332
00:18:50.341 --> 00:18:52.620
Stuff that the department stores couldn't buy.

333
00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.310
And then what happened was after the, the newspaper got,

334
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:58.290
is circulating like that to department stores,

335
00:18:58.291 --> 00:19:02.100
department stores came back and they said, Yo, all right, all right, fine, fine.

336
00:19:02.101 --> 00:19:05.790
We'll, we'll pay. We'll come back. And, and he said, no, I'll need you anymore.

337
00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:08.760
You know, I have people that can do this. I can do this with the people.

338
00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:12.180
And His newspaper was successful until the day he died.

339
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:16.260
So when I look at that example that was able to thrive in 19, uh, you know,

340
00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:19.800
20 or something or 1910 and whenever it was, I look at it and I'm like,

341
00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:24.480
if this guy just stood on his laurels and didn't bow,

342
00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:30.060
you know, then why can't we do it as a nation or as a team? You know? Um,

343
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:34.560
I think it's very possible to, uh, so for example, like when we look at gap,

344
00:19:34.561 --> 00:19:36.570
right? There's a new competitor, I'm not gonna mention the name,

345
00:19:36.571 --> 00:19:37.980
but it's like they,

346
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:42.540
whoever was the establishment created this alternative platform to compete with

347
00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:46.260
Gab on other workers. You know what I mentioned the name now screwed them,

348
00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:51.480
really puck them. Um, what's bad about them? Their establishment, right? Oh,

349
00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:55.620
so, so when I look at, so establishment is created another free speech platform,

350
00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:56.880
allegedly, allegedly,

351
00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:59.480
they're just going to collect the data on these people and, you know,

352
00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:03.360
sell it off. What makes you think that intuition, you know,

353
00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:05.010
hoteps have been told you, you know,

354
00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:10.380
[inaudible] that should be, well, we got a shirt.

355
00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:14.500
Hoteps been told you you that's how show, Oh man, I'll go to this.

356
00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:19.500
I show every Thursday, 8:00 PM eastern time. Um, so yeah. Um, you know,

357
00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.870
uh, I, I can, I can kind of,

358
00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:24.680
I've been calling a lot of these shots and a lot of these things and you know,

359
00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:28.490
there's just certain things that, you know, I'm a tech startup founder, right?

360
00:20:28.491 --> 00:20:28.920
Right.

361
00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:33.240
So it's certain things I can see within a business that the average person can't

362
00:20:33.241 --> 00:20:35.640
see. And I'm like, God, that doesn't make sense. That doesn't look right.

363
00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:38.820
And when you need to see, uh, you know, as a tech startup,

364
00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:44.340
it's really hard to get going right at first, but when you see like MSNBC, Dah,

365
00:20:44.341 --> 00:20:48.160
Dah, Dah, Dah, and it's just like, how'd you get all these coverage that fast?

366
00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:50.710
<v 1>Who Do you know? You know what I mean?</v>

367
00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:54.390
And then you start seeing the influencers that are going over there and pushing

368
00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.620
them like, oh, these are all established. I see what's going on.

369
00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:57.850
What you didn't want,

370
00:20:57.851 --> 00:21:02.851
you didn't want an alternative platform that you didn't control.

371
00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:07.060
Hmm. Okay. So they creating an alternative platform that they can control.

372
00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.210
They can control air quotes. Alternative, correct. Yeah.

373
00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.000
Well I think the writing is on the wall, right? If they look at the,

374
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:16.840
there's only one Twitter, there's only one Instagram.

375
00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.360
There's only one youtube and those are giant.

376
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:23.260
And Facebook is basically the only thing like that. Right?

377
00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:27.520
I mean there's really no competitor to Facebook in that space.

378
00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:30.760
I mean, this is four of them. They're all trash. Let's be honest.

379
00:21:30.761 --> 00:21:35.560
Oh my goodness. This all trash. Hotep is going off Facebook trash.

380
00:21:35.561 --> 00:21:38.050
I've been saying that for like the past decade. Facebook's trash.

381
00:21:38.051 --> 00:21:41.260
I stopped using Facebook a decade ago. Right. If I used it,

382
00:21:41.261 --> 00:21:44.170
it was just like forced, you know, I use it as a publishing outlet.

383
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:46.750
I want to put this tour dates or something like that.

384
00:21:46.751 --> 00:21:50.530
I put it on Facebook around engage. Right, exactly. Yeah. So you know, I can,

385
00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.660
I can respect that. I don't use Instagram.

386
00:21:52.661 --> 00:21:55.630
I lifted it months ago when of our Congo off the platform,

387
00:21:55.631 --> 00:21:57.640
a bunch of conservative got kicked off the platform. I'm like,

388
00:21:57.641 --> 00:21:59.590
I don't need this shit neither. So I left.

389
00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.920
And also to keep your account just in case. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah,

390
00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:05.350
it's bookmarked. Um, you know, I've got an automated Bot.

391
00:22:05.351 --> 00:22:09.610
I'm going to set up and order all that stuff. Yeah. So, you know,

392
00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:13.630
FDA's platforms, we don't need them. They're not that great.

393
00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:18.010
If you look at the story on Instagram, Instagram was a, uh,

394
00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:22.230
a lucky project. It was serendipitous, right. Basically what happened was, uh,

395
00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.730
some kids built a project, it was called Instagram.

396
00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.560
They were working on a whole bunch of other things.

397
00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:29.500
Some popular kids started using the platform.

398
00:22:29.501 --> 00:22:33.280
It blew up and then they pass it on Facebook from the very inception. I said,

399
00:22:33.281 --> 00:22:37.960
this is a very trash product product. It's just horrible. Horribly curated.

400
00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:42.910
Right. It's so horribly curated that Facebook can't even monetize the platform

401
00:22:42.911 --> 00:22:44.890
properly. Right. But that's a whole nother story.

402
00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:48.880
But the platform itself and its functionality is stupid.

403
00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:51.190
It's just popular. Well, you know,

404
00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:55.780
what's weird is like replying to people and reading replies,

405
00:22:55.781 --> 00:22:58.690
like went in the comments, like you can't even keep up with that. Nothing. No.

406
00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:00.610
And you can't get all your notifications.

407
00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:03.310
The notifications aren't curated properly. It's just,

408
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:06.520
it's like as if they don't care. Right? They don't care.

409
00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:10.780
They don't care or is it that it got so big so quick and it's stuck in this

410
00:23:10.781 --> 00:23:14.470
format? You'd have to kind of reformat the way it's they don't care.

411
00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:19.540
Don't think so. They don't care. They don't care if you,

412
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:24.250
if you want to build a product for your user, you can do that.

413
00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:27.190
If you want to build a product for advertisers, you can do that.

414
00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:29.650
They built the product for advertisers and not for users.

415
00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:33.040
If they build it for users, you and I will be able to have a conversation on it.

416
00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:37.960
Well isn't it originally, wasn't it text America? Was that the same thing?

417
00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:40.990
Was Text America the original one?

418
00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:44.140
That's the one where I have the picture of the prostitute. In the bathroom.

419
00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.830
You mean like where you at text something to

420
00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:48.260
<v 0>you send a photo, you send a photo on a tablet.</v>

421
00:23:48.261 --> 00:23:50.150
It wasn't like I would go up to an internet website.

422
00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:52.040
It would be like on a site like imagery or something.

423
00:23:52.041 --> 00:23:54.710
Not like a feed where people would follow you like that was it. No.

424
00:23:54.711 --> 00:23:56.140
There was a thing that you would follow. Okay.

425
00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:57.920
That's where that picture came from. I know that,

426
00:23:57.921 --> 00:24:00.680
but I didn't remember it being like a website or anything like that was back

427
00:24:00.681 --> 00:24:03.760
when there was no applications man, because I took that from a flip phone.

428
00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:07.050
The big deal. That's the difference. What kind of phone or like a smart phone?

429
00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:08.900
Yeah. There was no smart phones back then.

430
00:24:08.901 --> 00:24:11.750
And then you would have to go to a website to see all your photos.

431
00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:16.280
So like you have a young Jamie page on text America and all the pictures that

432
00:24:16.281 --> 00:24:19.250
you had taken, the first photos on Instagram, a lot of people were,

433
00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:22.130
you'd be like, Shit. As a photographer, you'd be kind of like shit on.

434
00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:27.020
If you weren't taking it with your iPhone only Mike and you were uploading DSLR

435
00:24:27.021 --> 00:24:27.854
photos, you'd be like,

436
00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:30.620
oh your fucking cheat and look at you likes that kind of Shit. Right.

437
00:24:30.621 --> 00:24:33.470
But now it filters like some of these girls who look like cartoons,

438
00:24:33.471 --> 00:24:34.520
they didn't even look like humans.

439
00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.770
<v 1>Hmm. I, you know, it comes down to is like, you know, I wish I could wholeness.</v>

440
00:24:37.771 --> 00:24:40.530
Right. So, you know, a lot of people told me and he was like, Yo,

441
00:24:40.531 --> 00:24:42.690
you missing out on a lot of money on Facebook.

442
00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:45.240
He missed out on a lot of Instagram or money on Instagram.

443
00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:49.250
My homies a millionaire off of Instagram and Facebook advertising and he told me

444
00:24:49.251 --> 00:24:50.850
about it. I'm like, Yo, I'm not in this for money bro.

445
00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:54.630
I got a message to get across and I can't get it across on these platforms.

446
00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:55.980
They suck. Right,

447
00:24:57.270 --> 00:25:01.980
but are you going to have the colonias to come and say,

448
00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:06.240
I'm choosing my laurels over. I'm choosing my morals over the money.

449
00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:09.990
Cause it's a lot of people out here that are on the Facebook platform just for

450
00:25:09.991 --> 00:25:10.560
money.

451
00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:15.560
I spoke to a conservative influencer and a brother basically said,

452
00:25:16.801 --> 00:25:20.400
I'm trying to feed my daughter, but the stuff he's putting out on Facebook,

453
00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:25.600
he doesn't believe in. So he's just doing it for profits. 200 for profit. Ooh,

454
00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.780
that's where it gets weird, right? He says,

455
00:25:27.781 --> 00:25:29.310
then people are not going to believe. You want to say,

456
00:25:29.311 --> 00:25:31.410
well I was doing that for money, but now I'm telling you the truth.

457
00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:32.880
But these are, I'm talking about this,

458
00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:34.860
these are the people that everybody believes.

459
00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:40.890
These are the ones that have captured a large audience.

460
00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:44.190
I mean, talking about, you know, type of money you can pull in on, on Facebook,

461
00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:47.370
but you know, he literally says, you know, I'll go on Twitter,

462
00:25:47.371 --> 00:25:51.560
I'll make one tweet and then they get like 2000 retweets and then, you know,

463
00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:54.810
you know, I, you know, it's, his brain just blows up like that,

464
00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.530
but it's because he, he knows the buzzwords, right?

465
00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:01.950
He knows what to say to get the people going, I'll go that route.

466
00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:04.830
You know what I mean? If I don't like Facebook, I'm not going to use,

467
00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:08.130
if I don't like Facebook, I'm not gonna use Instagram. You know, I'm just gonna,

468
00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:09.420
you know, stick with what I like.

469
00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:12.900
I like Twitter and I told people in 2009 when I go in there, I'm Twitter.

470
00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:14.820
You know, I deal in marketing.

471
00:26:14.821 --> 00:26:19.020
So I always say focus on one channel when it comes to social media and just one

472
00:26:19.021 --> 00:26:21.510
channel, unless you have the staff to manage. Well,

473
00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:24.360
Twitter is how I found out about you and that's all I found out about your

474
00:26:24.361 --> 00:26:27.680
videos and I found out what you're going to watch your videos and if,

475
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:29.340
if that didn't exist

476
00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:32.360
<v 0>and the, the portal for the video, you're putting your videos on youtube, right?</v>

477
00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:36.620
I mean, what, how else would someone get their message out if you, if you,

478
00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:39.590
if you think that these platforms are all trash, if they didn't exist,

479
00:26:39.591 --> 00:26:40.640
I wouldn't find out about you.

480
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:43.180
<v 1>Twitter's great. Twitter's great member. I'd like,</v>

481
00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:47.710
I've never mentioned Twitter do study. You said all of them are trashed,

482
00:26:47.711 --> 00:26:50.580
but all of them, except it's what Twitter, it's what is my baby man?

483
00:26:50.581 --> 00:26:54.490
I love Twitter. What do you like so much about Twitter? It's uh,

484
00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.220
it's, it's, it's, it's a perfect platform to crowd source information,

485
00:26:59.221 --> 00:27:02.610
number one. Right? Um, like you said, without Twitter, we,

486
00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:03.900
I wouldn't be sitting here right now.

487
00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:05.970
I couldn't have a got you on Facebook and Instagram.

488
00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:09.210
That would've never happened. Maybe Instagram, some of a friend,

489
00:27:09.211 --> 00:27:12.330
most of it is like, Hey, one of my friends says, check out this guy.

490
00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:14.030
This guy's cool. This guy's interesting. Right?

491
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:16.770
Maybe you should talk to this guy. Okay. That's how it usually happens.

492
00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.990
And then I'll go to your page and I checked it out and I saw a lot of

493
00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:22.200
interesting conversations you were having and saw some videos.

494
00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:27.180
Well the thing is Instagram doesn't allow you to see in my heart,

495
00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.420
they don't allow you to see in the sole Twitter.

496
00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:33.390
I can really connect with people. How come you can't do that in Instagram?

497
00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:37.800
The algorithm man, you know you, oh you mean because it hides stuff and stuff.

498
00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:40.890
Yeah. Once you developed a good following, it doesn't really matter.

499
00:27:40.891 --> 00:27:42.990
People would go to your page. But how awful for you.

500
00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:48.080
But how often can you post on Instagram? How often can you post with, well,

501
00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:50.460
you can't do it like Twitter where you can just do it every couple of minutes.

502
00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:52.950
See what I'm saying? So if I wanted to,

503
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:57.180
I could go from deep to where my middle aged white women at.

504
00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:00.760
Right in 15 minutes time. Right. You know,

505
00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:04.110
I can take you deep and then I could make you laugh. You know what I mean?

506
00:28:04.111 --> 00:28:06.720
And I can share, you know, something else, I can share my video.

507
00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:09.690
And you get that photos on Twitter, just like you could have on Instagram,

508
00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:11.580
really wanted to go live.

509
00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:16.340
And so Twitter is great at how they curate. Um,

510
00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:21.120
the live feature. It lands at the top of your phone on mobile. Right?

511
00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:25.050
It's beautiful. Like, like they, like they get product, you know,

512
00:28:25.051 --> 00:28:29.920
I don't feel like Instagram gets product. Um, but Twitter is, you know,

513
00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.390
matter of fact, this is a great time that I brought you my book.

514
00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:37.850
I thought that was McDonald's or Burger King. What is he eating? That car? Just,

515
00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:41.220
this is my book right here. Twitter marketing. I brought that for you.

516
00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:45.210
Retails on, um, how to build a cult like following. Yeah.

517
00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:50.100
And that's basically all my secrets on how I got on the Joe Rogan experience.

518
00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:53.160
I want to try, I'm trying to remember who told me about you.

519
00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:56.980
I want to give someone that you have the credit. I, uh, well, you know, they,

520
00:28:57.150 --> 00:28:59.030
people said to me, you know, you should go on Joe Rogan.

521
00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:00.710
And so I retweeted it and then, um,

522
00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:04.470
it started as far as storming your mentions and then you follow me and then I

523
00:29:04.471 --> 00:29:06.690
read to you the guy followed you because someone told me though,

524
00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:10.020
I'm trying to remember who the fuck it is. Oh, somebody, you know,

525
00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:13.700
somebody I knew. Okay. The guy's like a serendipitous thing like that.

526
00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:16.440
I don't even know if they'd seen you post that you're trying to get on the

527
00:29:16.441 --> 00:29:20.250
podcast. I think someone had just contacted me and said, hey,

528
00:29:20.251 --> 00:29:23.400
check out this guy. Shit. Oh, I have watched some of the youtube conversations.

529
00:29:23.530 --> 00:29:24.690
You just look like you were having a good time,

530
00:29:24.691 --> 00:29:27.750
but you're talking about serious shit. Yeah, it's, it's, you know,

531
00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:32.100
so I've got kids. So, um, when I,

532
00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:34.980
when I teach my kids, it's always through entertainment. You know,

533
00:29:34.981 --> 00:29:37.950
if I can't make my kids laugh while I'm doing my lecture everyday when they come

534
00:29:37.951 --> 00:29:41.020
home from school or I try to do everyday, there's a lecture way in for them.

535
00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:42.040
I'm going to talk

536
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.820
<v 2>about something real in life. How many kids? You have? Three of my daughters.</v>

537
00:29:45.821 --> 00:29:50.320
16 and my boys are Ra 2010. I have twin boys, a Dallas,

538
00:29:50.321 --> 00:29:54.010
Phoenix and Sydney. Um, they're all named have to cities. Um,

539
00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:58.870
so everyday they come home. I have a lecture waiting for them,

540
00:29:58.871 --> 00:30:01.570
but when I prepare my lectures for them,

541
00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:05.980
I always figure out how am I gonna make them laugh? Cause my son Dallas,

542
00:30:05.981 --> 00:30:09.670
he's a very linear in thinking I could lecture and I'll sit there and listen to

543
00:30:09.671 --> 00:30:13.030
every single word. The other two are like me. They'll just like zone out.

544
00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:16.780
So your twins not are they're identical twin fraternal fraternal. Yeah.

545
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:21.820
So his brother and his sister are just like me with all tune out and going to la

546
00:30:21.821 --> 00:30:25.150
La land and started getting weird when you have two kids that were born at the

547
00:30:25.151 --> 00:30:26.950
exact same time, they're are twins,

548
00:30:26.951 --> 00:30:30.570
but yet they're totally different and he looked different that so one's Brown's

549
00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:35.090
game. One's lightskin whoa. Both come out of the box at the same time too.

550
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:38.870
You hit it, you know, it's a crazy dynamic. The bursts, headaches and nuts, man.

551
00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:40.660
Yeah. Their personalities are very different.

552
00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:44.410
One of the thing that trips me out the most about having kids is how,

553
00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:49.030
how does they are their own little person out of the fucking box? Yeah.

554
00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:51.310
Like you influenced them a little. You teach them,

555
00:30:51.311 --> 00:30:54.670
you can give them morals and ethics and you can set a good example. But boy,

556
00:30:54.671 --> 00:30:58.450
they come with their own unique set of ingredients Yeti. Do you any do.

557
00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:01.660
And uh, you know, I don't, I don't try to change that.

558
00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:05.680
All I try to do is push them in that direction. Like whichever way you're going,

559
00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:08.170
I'm just going to try and assist that, you know,

560
00:31:08.171 --> 00:31:12.280
I don't try to like bring you back this way. So my son Dallas, he likes to draw,

561
00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:15.220
you know, and I'm like, alright, well here's some youtube videos, tutorials,

562
00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:17.770
do it every day. You know, my son Phoenix is like,

563
00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:20.030
I want to have my own comic book. I'm like, we'll start writing it.

564
00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:22.670
And he starts writing his comic book and then he comes in,

565
00:31:22.671 --> 00:31:25.930
he asked me questions and I help them, we share in a Google doc and we just,

566
00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:28.690
we just do the damn thing. You know what I mean? That's cool. Yeah,

567
00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:32.770
they're little startups. So you kinda just gotta you just gotta feed them,

568
00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:36.320
you know? That's a good way of looking at it. Yeah. Um, you know,

569
00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:38.320
you've got a wardroom man and just let them grow.

570
00:31:38.321 --> 00:31:41.470
I think sometimes we try to prune them too much. Well,

571
00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:44.530
you definitely see that a lot with people that are too,

572
00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:48.700
they're just way too heavy handed with their kids and the kids just always

573
00:31:48.701 --> 00:31:52.240
resisting. Oh yeah. They're just constantly to get the fuck away from me, man.

574
00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:55.390
Necessary. It's unnecessary. It's unproductive.

575
00:31:55.391 --> 00:31:59.200
And you're going to develop a rift between you and your kids. Yeah. So,

576
00:31:59.201 --> 00:32:02.030
so this story I always tell is, um, you know, when,

577
00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:04.150
when you black and you go into a supermarket,

578
00:32:04.151 --> 00:32:06.820
you get that talk like Ben not going, Hey Ben, not touching it.

579
00:32:06.821 --> 00:32:09.760
Don't ask for nothing. Right. So, um, you know, that's how I grew up.

580
00:32:09.761 --> 00:32:10.594
A lot of us grew up.

581
00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:13.570
So when I go into the supermarket or I went into the supermarket this one time

582
00:32:13.571 --> 00:32:15.670
and my son is a Phoenix, my twin,

583
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.810
he's running around in the supermarket and you know, I don't,

584
00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:21.670
I try not to yell at my kids and all that stuff, right?

585
00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:24.540
So I just tap his brother and sister on a show and I said, look at him,

586
00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:27.520
look at him, look at him. And he look and, and we just started laughing at him.

587
00:32:27.521 --> 00:32:30.280
So he turns around and goes like, why are y'all laughing at me?

588
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:34.650
So then I start imitating [inaudible] doing all that type stuff and he's,

589
00:32:34.651 --> 00:32:38.710
so he's, I put the mirror in front of my, with the mirror and when he does that,

590
00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:40.003
never again.

591
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:42.800
<v 1>Yeah. Problem again. I didn't have to yell at him. I didn't have to hit him.</v>

592
00:32:42.801 --> 00:32:45.410
I had to cuss him out and I have to threaten them. That's great that, you know,

593
00:32:45.411 --> 00:32:47.780
it's just, it's just basic psychology. Yeah.

594
00:32:47.781 --> 00:32:50.060
That's one of the hardest things for people to do is see how other people see

595
00:32:50.061 --> 00:32:53.030
them. And when someone sees you with humor and you look like a fool, like,

596
00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:54.350
oh shit, that's me.

597
00:32:55.880 --> 00:33:00.560
That is me is ugly. So you just gotta put your mirror. But you know, Twitter,

598
00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:03.830
you know, I, I handle, I handle everything. Uh, you know,

599
00:33:03.831 --> 00:33:06.380
I figure you can't change culture through lecture.

600
00:33:06.381 --> 00:33:07.910
You change culture through entertainment.

601
00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:12.340
What do you think about all this talk like Elizabeth Warren's talked about it

602
00:33:12.341 --> 00:33:14.960
and some other candidates have talked about as mother politicians have talked

603
00:33:14.961 --> 00:33:17.660
about breaking up these big companies, breaking up Facebook.

604
00:33:17.661 --> 00:33:21.170
It's too big breakup, Google breakup, Twitter. What do you think about that?

605
00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:24.620
Well, um, I think we have to study what happened to standard oil.

606
00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:28.490
What happened to standard oil standard oil. They uh,

607
00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:33.230
broke it up and it became, uh, Exxon, Chevron,

608
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:37.700
Texaco, uh, I think BP,

609
00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:41.660
don't quote me on that one, but does anybody have brand loyalty to gas?

610
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:46.430
Does anybody like, dude, I'm a Chevron man. They create those, those cards,

611
00:33:46.431 --> 00:33:49.550
right? Those Oh, loyals. You guys cards. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah.

612
00:33:49.551 --> 00:33:51.200
That's how they created a loyalty program. Here it is.

613
00:33:51.201 --> 00:33:54.050
The evolution of standard oil. Jamie pulled it up on the screen. Yeah,

614
00:33:54.051 --> 00:33:58.460
there you go. Wow. So standard oil was too big. Yeah. Like fuck this place,

615
00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:02.970
right? We have to move it around a little bit. 1911 standard oil of Kentucky,

616
00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:06.580
1911 they did this, right. So, so if you look at it, it's broken up into,

617
00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:10.510
I think it says 34 right? 34 companies, right? So you start them on a,

618
00:34:10.511 --> 00:34:13.070
on the left, right. And then as you go, what do you see?

619
00:34:13.071 --> 00:34:17.760
You see a consolidation, don't you? You see these emerges. Yeah.

620
00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:19.670
So when you break up a monopoly,

621
00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:22.160
you're not really breaking up with not monopoly.

622
00:34:22.161 --> 00:34:25.340
What you're doing is you're creating a divide and conquer dynamic. So it's like,

623
00:34:25.341 --> 00:34:27.730
okay, I'll let my brother control this one.

624
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:29.720
My sister control that with my cousin controls us.

625
00:34:29.930 --> 00:34:32.450
And you actually corner the market.

626
00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:38.120
So breaking up with not believe isn't exactly a good thing in that case.

627
00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:42.140
Yeah. In that case, and I think we'll see the same thing with Google.

628
00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:44.630
If we break up Google or what you are going to do is just have little

629
00:34:44.631 --> 00:34:49.631
subsidiaries or little satellite things that will just control a certain segment

630
00:34:49.731 --> 00:34:53.390
under a different name, which would make it harder to track back to its source.

631
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:56.360
So I, you know, when I say, you know, break up monopoly,

632
00:34:56.390 --> 00:35:00.320
I think that the establishments like, yeah, come on, break me up baby.

633
00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:04.010
You think so? Oh Dan, I don't think they want to lose any control.

634
00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:05.630
I certainly know like Facebook does.

635
00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:10.220
It's not using controlled Zuckerberg forever, right?

636
00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:11.300
Aren't they trying to get rid of him?

637
00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:15.140
The board members don't like as a date claim, but that robot Outta here,

638
00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:18.140
let's look away drinks water, right? He doesn't look like a robot.

639
00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:25.490
We drink water in front of Congress. But isn't that socialism? That's socialism.

640
00:35:25.491 --> 00:35:26.000
When you don't,

641
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.670
the government comes in and tells you what you can do with your cooperation.

642
00:35:28.671 --> 00:35:30.620
Yeah. That's socialism. So,

643
00:35:30.621 --> 00:35:35.180
so what I feel is like the powers that be are pushing socialism or like we can

644
00:35:35.181 --> 00:35:38.580
use this as an excuse to Evel dre corporations

645
00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:40.170
<v 2>and you know, Blah Blah Blah, blah, blah.</v>

646
00:35:40.171 --> 00:35:43.110
And can start controlling this internet space.

647
00:35:43.111 --> 00:35:44.970
So the Internet space is now communist.

648
00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:49.680
<v 3>I'm of the opinion though that if we believe in freedom of speech and you create</v>

649
00:35:49.681 --> 00:35:52.380
something that's so big that it's essentially a town square,

650
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:57.270
which is what I think these platforms are [inaudible] you. If you ban people,

651
00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:59.940
especially if you ban people from Shit, like learn to code,

652
00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:01.480
like things that don't make any sense. Yeah.

653
00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:04.790
There's people that getting banned for some pretty ridiculous ideas. Yeah.

654
00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:07.380
That as soon as you start doing something like that,

655
00:36:07.381 --> 00:36:11.340
you are going against the fundamental ideas that this country has found done.

656
00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:12.540
Absolute freedom of speech.

657
00:36:12.541 --> 00:36:17.541
I think it's incredibly important that if you have someone saying something that

658
00:36:17.581 --> 00:36:20.490
you think is wrong or is hurtful,

659
00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:25.380
there should be an avenue where people can examine that and talk about it and

660
00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:28.980
combat it with good speech with speech. That makes sense.

661
00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:32.450
<v 2>Yeah. Well, you know, a couple of years ago, last year, I forget now,</v>

662
00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:36.580
it was about a couple of years ago, um, I was lambasted for, uh,

663
00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:40.340
defending white nationalists and you know, when they first got d platforms,

664
00:36:40.341 --> 00:36:42.970
some of them got deep platform with just white nationalist period. I'm like,

665
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.970
well, if this is how these people feel, let's listen to them.

666
00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:48.190
It's listen to their gripes. What are they mad about? Right?

667
00:36:48.191 --> 00:36:50.790
And then people like, oh, how could you, these people that are racist.

668
00:36:50.890 --> 00:36:53.650
And I'm like, I don't care if they're racist. Like that doesn't affect me.

669
00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:57.280
Right? Like I'm not asking them for a job so they can't be racist towards me.

670
00:36:57.281 --> 00:37:00.430
You know what I mean? But, um, when you have these,

671
00:37:00.431 --> 00:37:03.970
these groups that people call fringe,

672
00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:09.300
I feel like the people that are fringe are the tests for freedom of speech.

673
00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:11.380
It's not the people in the middle,

674
00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:15.010
it's the fringe groups on the outside if they don't have freedom of speech.

675
00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:18.430
Everybody in the middle school group. So I stood up and I was like, Yo,

676
00:37:18.431 --> 00:37:21.670
let these dudes talk. Like, stop doing that. Like, like, you know, I don't care,

677
00:37:21.671 --> 00:37:23.590
you know, if they're racist or whatever, people call me names.

678
00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:27.610
But then now you see it coming down and we lost, you know, Louis Farrakhan, e.

679
00:37:27.611 --> 00:37:31.240
Dot. D platform. He lost his verification, you know, and it's like this,

680
00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:35.190
<v 3>was there anything specifically that he said that allowed him to do that?</v>

681
00:37:35.191 --> 00:37:38.110
Or did they just make a sweeping cause they got rid of Milo.

682
00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:39.480
They got rid of Gavin McInnes.

683
00:37:39.481 --> 00:37:42.720
They got rid of a bunch of people that were on Instagram and Facebook that they

684
00:37:42.721 --> 00:37:43.810
hadn't d platform.

685
00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:47.910
But it didn't seem like there was anything that happened that caused them to do

686
00:37:47.911 --> 00:37:48.270
that.

687
00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:53.160
It seemed like they just made some sort of a decision that I think was probably

688
00:37:53.161 --> 00:37:55.830
based on preparing for the 2020 election.

689
00:37:56.020 --> 00:38:00.130
<v 2>Absolutely. So, so what I think what happened was, uh, the, uh,</v>

690
00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:05.260
the banning of Louis Farrakhan is just a theory, but they were like, all right,

691
00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:07.210
if we ban these conservatives,

692
00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:09.820
the conservative crowd is going to just go apeshit. Right.

693
00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:12.970
But if we throw him Louis Farrakhan,

694
00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:17.650
it'll kinda settle things down a little bit. Cause it will look like we're fair.

695
00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:19.900
I think you're exactly right. Yeah. So I'm like,

696
00:38:19.901 --> 00:38:22.840
so that's what they did and like, Hey, let's throw him in there now, you know,

697
00:38:22.841 --> 00:38:25.740
smooth things over. That's exactly what I thought when I saw it. Yeah. Yeah.

698
00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:30.250
I was like, this seems weird. Yeah. It's like they have to justify like, no,

699
00:38:30.251 --> 00:38:35.020
we got rid of him too, you know? Yeah. Yeah. It's a,

700
00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:36.130
it's a strange

701
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:37.750
<v 3>time because there's,</v>

702
00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:41.590
even though there is gap and there's mines and there's is a couple of other

703
00:38:41.591 --> 00:38:42.424
startups,

704
00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:46.720
they're trying to make their way into the Jordan Peterson one and there's

705
00:38:46.721 --> 00:38:50.180
nothing that really stands out. And once someone starts, once a,

706
00:38:50.181 --> 00:38:54.100
a giant group of people starts using something, unless it's like, what's,

707
00:38:54.101 --> 00:38:56.710
what's hilarious is when they, one of them vanish like my space.

708
00:38:56.711 --> 00:39:00.850
How fucking badly did they manage my space because my space had it all.

709
00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:05.770
They had everybody and then it just fucking died and still around.

710
00:39:05.771 --> 00:39:09.940
But now it's like some fringe music publishing platform. It's very weird.

711
00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:11.530
You know, still exists.

712
00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:16.860
But what Twitter is right now and what Facebook is right now and what Instagram

713
00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:21.070
is right now, it seems like there's no real competitors per se,

714
00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:23.860
specifically youtube. There's no real competitors

715
00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:27.810
<v 2>because, because when, you know,</v>

716
00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:32.100
I don't want to dog pile on, you know, mines or Gab or anything.

717
00:39:32.101 --> 00:39:36.450
But the problem is when you build a social network and is why will not build a

718
00:39:36.451 --> 00:39:38.910
social network at least not in to the next 10 years.

719
00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:44.330
You have to understand that you can't build a social network that mimics another

720
00:39:44.791 --> 00:39:48.420
one. Hmm. It has to bro. It has to be different.

721
00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:53.310
That's why snap is still here, right? Snap is inside a certain demographic.

722
00:39:53.311 --> 00:39:55.960
That's my daughters, you know, generation, right?

723
00:39:56.190 --> 00:40:01.080
That's them right there on snap. So when you build these things,

724
00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:05.880
you really have to sit down and say like, you know, what's the,

725
00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:10.220
what are we going to focus on? Like with mines, right? You Poach Physios,

726
00:40:10.221 --> 00:40:13.560
you post photos and then how do the photos appear? Right?

727
00:40:13.561 --> 00:40:16.590
So when I look at minds, minds is my Instagram. When you,

728
00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:20.130
when you look at minds on mobile, that the fonts really small. So it's like,

729
00:40:20.131 --> 00:40:22.390
I can't read this, so I'm just going to use this for photos.

730
00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:25.410
Can I put the photos? It pops up, right? So it's like,

731
00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:29.670
is mind's going to go that route? Or they're going to go the video route.

732
00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:31.200
Are they going to go the tweet route?

733
00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:35.160
You got to pick one and then grow from there. If you look at Twitter,

734
00:40:35.161 --> 00:40:37.260
Twitter didn't have all these Fitch features in the beginning.

735
00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:41.960
You just had tweaked. That's it. There was no threats. You know what I mean?

736
00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:46.200
None of that. So you have to start at your core, but when you,

737
00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:50.940
the other problem they do is they try to build these social networks, um,

738
00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:55.950
completely robust, right? With all the bells and whistles of the giants.

739
00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:58.063
Nah, Bro,

740
00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:03.000
you got to start small and slim and then let your audience tell you what the

741
00:41:03.001 --> 00:41:05.790
next feature is. So what would you, if you were going to start one up,

742
00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:09.210
what would it be? Or do you know? I'd information now it's not,

743
00:41:09.211 --> 00:41:11.610
I don't want to give it out in information. I think information should be free,

744
00:41:11.611 --> 00:41:14.310
but you know, I, I hate,

745
00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:17.760
I hate the idea that people want to create social networks. I'm like,

746
00:41:17.761 --> 00:41:18.360
they exist.

747
00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:21.420
Let's use the ones that exist and let's just figure out how to make them better.

748
00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:22.530
Right? If you need to do that,

749
00:41:22.531 --> 00:41:26.340
then those have so much power because they can dictate who's on and who's not

750
00:41:26.341 --> 00:41:30.030
on, right? So what you do is when you have something like a Twitter,

751
00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:34.100
you use your Twitter, uh, to congregate your minds, right?

752
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:39.200
<v 1>But then you're, you know, you're, your bills of the world,</v>

753
00:41:39.201 --> 00:41:44.170
your, your Andrew Toby's of the world have to listen to the community and,

754
00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:48.770
and then cure rate their product around what the community needs. Right.

755
00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:53.240
Andrew Toba figured out what the dissenter when he found out, oh,

756
00:41:53.241 --> 00:41:57.260
the Internet is blocking comments. So then he created, you know,

757
00:41:57.261 --> 00:42:01.160
you can comment on anywhere on the internet and then Google chrome smashed it.

758
00:42:01.161 --> 00:42:03.800
Right. As I get that Outta here. Yeah. Why did they do that?

759
00:42:03.801 --> 00:42:06.800
What was the justification for getting rid of that? They want a sensor.

760
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:09.320
It didn't want to sensor inflammation.

761
00:42:09.321 --> 00:42:11.900
Is that what they want to do or they want to keep a competitor from using their

762
00:42:11.901 --> 00:42:14.570
platform and profiting off of it. That's how I looked at it.

763
00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:17.670
I looked at it from a marketing or a business perspective. Nah,

764
00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:21.260
I ain't worried about his name because it can be, but if it becomes huge,

765
00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:24.260
I mean anything can become huge if it's useful. Yeah.

766
00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:28.130
That seemed useful to me that they were going to be able to comment on anything

767
00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:31.910
and you'll have like a little link and if you use gab you can comment on

768
00:42:31.911 --> 00:42:36.050
anything that comes up. Yeah. Yeah. You can look at it like that. I don't,

769
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:39.680
I feel like, you know, they, their budgets are so huge. They're, they, you know,

770
00:42:39.681 --> 00:42:43.340
their cash reserves is so huge that they're not worried about competition at

771
00:42:43.341 --> 00:42:46.620
all. You know, what they're worried about is, uh,

772
00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:51.700
controlling thought and that's their primary goal and control thought,

773
00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:58.190
right. For the betterment of the ruling class. And that's,

774
00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:03.170
to me, that's, that's the end all be all of it all. Um, but you, uh,

775
00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:08.570
these, these, you know, the, these, these people that create tech products,

776
00:43:08.571 --> 00:43:12.020
like when we create coin bits app or for example, my app, Jeff Fatah's,

777
00:43:12.730 --> 00:43:15.530
Jeff midsize do you can only do one thing on derivatize.

778
00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:17.540
The only thing you can do is, uh,

779
00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:21.200
save a video or g or Jif from Twitter.

780
00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:25.610
I always call it a Gif. Is it Jeff? I think it's Jeff. I've never,

781
00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:28.910
I don't think I ever hear anybody say it. Gift could be correct.

782
00:43:30.690 --> 00:43:34.090
Could be correct. Do you know what he called Jamie? I call it Gif.

783
00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:39.040
If Jeff Gif. Jeff is peanut butter. Alright. Jeff has been great,

784
00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:43.220
but our app does one thing right.

785
00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:46.550
And people love it.

786
00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:50.990
When I first came on as a co founder, this app did more than that.

787
00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:55.850
And when it did more than that, it didn't do as well as it does now.

788
00:43:55.880 --> 00:44:00.240
What it used to do, uh, we had incentives, uh, to uh,

789
00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:04.670
share the app. You could edit g, uh, gifts. Uh, you could,

790
00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:08.660
um, put text on them, um, uh,

791
00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:12.460
crop them all types of like had an editor in there. So I was like, Yo,

792
00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:16.370
take this editor, toss it out all, we had a keyboard and you know,

793
00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:17.391
it still has a keyboard,

794
00:44:17.391 --> 00:44:19.850
but I was like took some of the functionalities and I just started taking stuff

795
00:44:19.851 --> 00:44:21.220
out and just like, get this Outta here, get this out.

796
00:44:21.221 --> 00:44:25.340
I get necessary slim it down. Right. As soon as we slimmed it down, we chained,

797
00:44:25.341 --> 00:44:30.080
gave it a new face. Boom. I revenue quadruple what's again,

798
00:44:30.350 --> 00:44:33.730
tell people get it. Yeah. [inaudible] do you have a tight there? Yes.

799
00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:36.900
Jamie's got it. Yeah. G, F, r. I. T. I. Z. E,

800
00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:41.160
the ultimate Twitter gift downloader. Yeah. Yeah. And this is,

801
00:44:41.161 --> 00:44:44.350
this thing's about to be super huge. Uh,

802
00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:47.640
we have a gallery coming soon and that's going to be awesome.

803
00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:49.500
I'm going to be perfectly curated.

804
00:44:49.530 --> 00:44:52.200
I'm not speak to my partner Simona's morning about that.

805
00:44:52.570 --> 00:44:55.740
This is one of the fun things about Twitter when someone says something stupid

806
00:44:55.920 --> 00:45:00.000
and then you look at all the gifts underneath it. Memes and gifs. Yeah.

807
00:45:00.001 --> 00:45:03.570
So we empower people like black twitters on our app.

808
00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:06.930
So whenever there's a new video out,

809
00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:09.990
you know it's something funny happens and you use an as a reaction.

810
00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:14.640
So we on Ios, there's no way to save it. Now you can with our app.

811
00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:19.200
But app only does one thing and everybody's, and they love it. Right?

812
00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:23.610
That's, that's the core of the business.

813
00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:29.250
What's the core of minds? What's the core of gap?

814
00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:34.020
What's the core feature? Does anybody know? There is not a core feature? Yeah,

815
00:45:34.021 --> 00:45:37.710
I wouldn't, I would say just something as an alternative to traditional media.

816
00:45:37.711 --> 00:45:41.430
You see what I'm saying? So there is no uniqueness where there is no uniqueness.

817
00:45:41.431 --> 00:45:45.840
You can't compete. You have to first create uniqueness. Mm.

818
00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:47.700
Or, or fill a need.

819
00:45:49.010 --> 00:45:52.010
There is no need for me to be on these other platforms. Well,

820
00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:54.450
the problem is when you get on those other platforms and there's no one,

821
00:45:54.451 --> 00:45:57.450
there you go, Huh? Let me go back to Twitter real quick. Yeah.

822
00:45:57.451 --> 00:46:00.370
And that's why I say when you build a social network, the,

823
00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:04.080
before you build a network, you have, I mean, before you build the platform,

824
00:46:04.081 --> 00:46:05.220
you have to build a network.

825
00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:11.430
What's interesting if you go back to like 2003 when my space was king and then

826
00:46:11.490 --> 00:46:14.520
you imagine what the world would be like 16 years later,

827
00:46:14.521 --> 00:46:16.260
no one would have saw this coming.

828
00:46:16.530 --> 00:46:21.530
No one would have saw all these social media platforms and that it's used as a

829
00:46:22.351 --> 00:46:24.570
way of breaking news now. I mean,

830
00:46:24.571 --> 00:46:29.370
especially in places that don't have real objective news.

831
00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:33.600
So if you're in some country that's some war torn country and some horrible shit

832
00:46:33.601 --> 00:46:38.130
is going down, you see the news breaking on Twitter before anywhere.

833
00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:40.320
Oh yeah. Really interesting. Oh yeah.

834
00:46:40.321 --> 00:46:43.320
That's what I tell people like screw Facebook and Instagram. The news breaks on,

835
00:46:43.350 --> 00:46:47.860
on Twitter, you know, by the time, you know, by the time I show all my friend,

836
00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:49.800
my friend shows me a video. I'm like,

837
00:46:49.801 --> 00:46:51.240
I saw it on Twitter like two weeks ago Bro.

838
00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:55.290
Cause he's on Facebook or he's on Instagram. Right.

839
00:46:55.440 --> 00:47:00.000
So it's like how do you market a product or market yourself when you're two

840
00:47:00.001 --> 00:47:04.380
weeks behind? [inaudible] is two weeks behind on Instagram though.

841
00:47:04.381 --> 00:47:09.100
I get a lot of shit on Instagram too. Like you're Joe Rogan. Yeah.

842
00:47:10.490 --> 00:47:14.730
So it's different, you know, it depends on who you're surrounded by, right?

843
00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:16.440
So when we talk about network, it's like, you know,

844
00:47:16.441 --> 00:47:18.510
who are the people connected to? Are you following?

845
00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:22.980
Who's who you interacting with? But I get like, mom, that's not true.

846
00:47:22.981 --> 00:47:26.210
I was gonna say, I get like most of the fucked up videos of news,

847
00:47:26.211 --> 00:47:29.230
stories of bad things that are happening in the news come to me on Instagram.

848
00:47:29.231 --> 00:47:30.070
But I think send it to

849
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:32.020
<v 3>you. Yeah, but I think it's even,</v>

850
00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:35.080
I think it's even with Instagram and Twitter [inaudible] sending me things.

851
00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:39.380
<v 2>Well you didn't one when you're Joe Rogan, even ever your hotep Jesus,</v>

852
00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:42.000
like a people will say to me, how do you know so much? I'm like, Yo,

853
00:47:42.001 --> 00:47:45.690
my followers, like yeah, books and links and stuff like that.

854
00:47:45.691 --> 00:47:48.460
Like they're just sending it to me. You know, sometimes I ask them sums,

855
00:47:48.461 --> 00:47:51.120
I don't, but they're volunteering information. Um,

856
00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:55.500
so when you're in that position, you know you can afford it. But when,

857
00:47:55.650 --> 00:47:57.210
so the key to marketing is this, you know,

858
00:47:57.320 --> 00:48:00.630
you've got your four p's of marketing, but the key to marketing is relevance.

859
00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:05.310
If what you're talking about is irrelevant, nobody's paying attention to you,

860
00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:06.330
right? Yeah.

861
00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:11.330
So the only thing that makes somebody platforms relevant is the juxtaposition to

862
00:48:11.371 --> 00:48:14.640
the big tech giants. You remove the tech giants. Are you still relevant?

863
00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:16.733
What makes you relative?

864
00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:21.240
<v 3>Right, right, right. That's where a lot of people that do content,</v>

865
00:48:21.241 --> 00:48:24.510
whether they're um, you know, podcasters or whatever,

866
00:48:24.690 --> 00:48:28.710
they probably should be thinking about developing an email list and putting

867
00:48:28.711 --> 00:48:29.491
things on the website,

868
00:48:29.491 --> 00:48:32.250
having something available independently of these big platforms.

869
00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:34.950
I've been thinking about that a lot lately doing what,

870
00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:39.660
but if something that independent of these big platforms where like if you mean

871
00:48:39.661 --> 00:48:43.230
you see all these people that have gotten deep platforms and I don't think I'm

872
00:48:43.231 --> 00:48:44.580
at the risk of that,

873
00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:48.630
but if I didn't think these people were just a few years ago as the climate

874
00:48:48.631 --> 00:48:52.380
shifts and people get more and more radical with this idea of d platforming,

875
00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:55.260
I think it becomes like a game of like shooting ducks.

876
00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:56.670
People get excited about it.

877
00:48:56.671 --> 00:48:58.830
They like taking people out whether it makes sense or not.

878
00:48:59.310 --> 00:49:02.130
And I think there's a lot of that going on where people are calling for people

879
00:49:02.131 --> 00:49:05.640
to be TD platform just because they disagree with them.

880
00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:10.440
And so far these big tech companies have resisted some of it,

881
00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:12.780
but not, not enough of it for my taste.

882
00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:18.410
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah. You know, my boy Alex Jones,</v>

883
00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:21.650
they got him out of here. I think, you know,

884
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.700
if I was Alex, my ego would be so huge after getting the platform.

885
00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:29.770
<v 3>Well when we did a podcast together after he was d platform,</v>

886
00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:32.370
it was one of the biggest podcasts of all time. But again,

887
00:49:32.490 --> 00:49:35.950
like 16 million youtube videos or something. That's your high use.

888
00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:40.210
Me and my youtube did not demonetize that one. We let them know in advance,

889
00:49:40.211 --> 00:49:44.560
just heads up. Alex Jones is coming on and then they just took that money.

890
00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:48.900
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

891
00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:52.920
<v 3>It's interesting how it works, right? Like what they choose to d platform with.</v>

892
00:49:52.921 --> 00:49:57.580
They don't choose to, you know, it's um, I mean,

893
00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:01.080
I don't like the argument that they're, they're doing it for our good. I don't,

894
00:50:01.081 --> 00:50:01.914
I don't think they are.

895
00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:06.080
<v 2>Oh, who, who, who, who made them? God. Who made them, you know,</v>

896
00:50:06.081 --> 00:50:09.770
mom and said this is good for you and they should be forced to follow the first

897
00:50:09.771 --> 00:50:13.700
amendment. No. What do you think they should be forced to do? Nothing. Nothing.

898
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:14.743
Nothing. I think,

899
00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:19.610
I think they should be operating in a manner that doesn't hurt earth. You know,

900
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.560
it doesn't hurt their nature. Right.

901
00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:26.300
If they're polluting or doing something at harm, somebody specifically,

902
00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:29.780
um, then yes. Right. So if they become a giant monopoly,

903
00:50:29.781 --> 00:50:31.610
just because they're better than everything else that's available,

904
00:50:31.611 --> 00:50:34.010
like youtube has become, then they run the show.

905
00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:38.540
But there is always the underground. Yeah. Look at hip hop. Right?

906
00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:43.610
There's always been an underground hip hop comedy as well. Comedy as well,

907
00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:45.320
you know, so you got dudes, you know,

908
00:50:45.321 --> 00:50:47.720
so I was talking to somebody that day and we tell them our consciousness,

909
00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:51.410
conscious hip hop and do say, oh, there's no money in conscious hip hop.

910
00:50:51.810 --> 00:50:53.180
I'm like, what? I'm like Pharrell,

911
00:50:53.181 --> 00:50:58.181
much tours consistently dead pres dead Prez towards aid system.

912
00:50:59.511 --> 00:51:04.160
Never had any mainstream attention at all. The only,

913
00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:07.220
the closest thing they had the mainstreams when they were Dave Chappelle's block

914
00:51:07.221 --> 00:51:10.100
party. Okay. That was about it. Yeah. Yeah.

915
00:51:10.101 --> 00:51:14.720
So it's like you don't need mainstream, we don't need me stream. You know?

916
00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:18.590
Here's the thing with mainstream, when you get mainstream, you're that bitch.

917
00:51:18.591 --> 00:51:22.210
Now you got to play by the rules, you know, and,

918
00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:25.580
and once you break those roles, you get deep platforms,

919
00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:30.440
which you need to do is you need to focus on building your own platform so they

920
00:51:30.441 --> 00:51:33.920
can't touch you when you get to a certain place. Say if you're helping me out,

921
00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:36.560
I called you and Hotep teases me. I need some help. Right?

922
00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:40.530
What do I do with this platform? This platform right here. Right here. Oh Dang.

923
00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:42.990
That's why didn't they come down on us? A I,

924
00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:48.410
so you got to self host it probably on blockchain. Um, I would definitely a bit,

925
00:51:48.411 --> 00:51:52.190
shoot, just locked. Uh, how do I sell posted on blockchain? I don't know.

926
00:51:52.191 --> 00:51:55.100
Blockchain is one of those words that I use that I don't really understand.

927
00:51:55.300 --> 00:52:00.100
<v 4>Me Too. I just say because it's a cool buzzword. That's a great word.</v>

928
00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:02.080
It's just like, sounds like if you each,

929
00:52:02.081 --> 00:52:05.050
some dude is a tech guy like yourself as a tech startup and you start talking

930
00:52:05.051 --> 00:52:07.570
about block chain. I go, Oh yeah, I'll just nod my head. Yeah,

931
00:52:08.050 --> 00:52:13.050
blockchain is my friend uploaded a MP3 to the BSV network maybe.

932
00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:16.130
Okay. It's just very confusing and I was trying to ask him, I'm like,

933
00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:19.390
now that it's on there. Yeah. Wow. How do people going to get it?

934
00:52:19.391 --> 00:52:22.420
And like he wanted to just be like the first on there, which he is or whatever.

935
00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:26.680
I might not be BSV. I might be speaking your rapper friend. Yes. Okay. Hey,

936
00:52:26.681 --> 00:52:28.810
well he's like, he's ahead of him. He's ahead of this. He's just like,

937
00:52:28.811 --> 00:52:30.690
come on some of this bitcoin stuff, so yeah,

938
00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:33.520
but that's where it's at and I was like talking to him for that.

939
00:52:33.521 --> 00:52:35.500
Like he's almost my Guinea pig. Like, all right, you did it.

940
00:52:35.501 --> 00:52:39.310
How you figured it out. Now how do I get a three hour podcast on there?

941
00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:42.430
How are people going to get it? It's like it's not figured out yet.

942
00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:46.810
People are definitely working on it and that every day there's been advances.

943
00:52:47.170 --> 00:52:49.000
I just don't know. I don't know how it's going.

944
00:52:49.230 --> 00:52:53.910
<v 2>I mean, you could build your own cloud. Yes. You know, build your own cloud and,</v>

945
00:52:53.970 --> 00:52:57.420
and self host and you know, you, you know what else you could do.

946
00:52:57.780 --> 00:53:00.930
You could connect with all your other celebrity buddies,

947
00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:05.430
pull your resources together and just build a competitor and then own this space

948
00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:09.780
and be like, I'm the new youtube, it's called Rogan tube now. Hmm.

949
00:53:09.810 --> 00:53:10.471
You know what I mean?

950
00:53:10.471 --> 00:53:13.590
You could do that and then everybody just runs to your platform. I'd support it.

951
00:53:13.710 --> 00:53:14.880
I'd have to have a way better name.

952
00:53:14.881 --> 00:53:17.370
How do you do that without using Google's cloud services?

953
00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:18.630
What do you need to do is by Vimeo,

954
00:53:18.690 --> 00:53:22.540
Vimeo was dying on the vine that pitches barely alive. What's so, so like,

955
00:53:23.090 --> 00:53:24.870
so these questions that you asked, right?

956
00:53:24.930 --> 00:53:28.200
Like there's like they own the internet kind of almost. So these,

957
00:53:28.201 --> 00:53:30.960
these questions that you ask, I don't know. I don't. Cool. Right, right.

958
00:53:30.961 --> 00:53:35.480
So what we do is we get the best tech minds in the building and we ask them the

959
00:53:35.481 --> 00:53:38.280
questions, hey, answer this. It's not like they can't answer.

960
00:53:38.410 --> 00:53:41.760
I'm sure they're going to find solutions. There's always a way, you know,

961
00:53:41.761 --> 00:53:43.350
just got to put the right minds in the room.

962
00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:46.560
[inaudible] you know the right minds in the room and the right people that are

963
00:53:46.561 --> 00:53:49.410
influencers that can get the word out. Yeah, you have to,

964
00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:53.190
you've got to follow the yard drop on a Napkin rule. And you know,

965
00:53:53.191 --> 00:53:57.450
when you put the drop on the Napkin, it spreads out, right? So you gotta figure,

966
00:53:57.570 --> 00:53:59.670
you know, who's your network and then you know,

967
00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:03.360
maybe build like 12 people around and make sure that these people are linked,

968
00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:05.490
you know, based upon interest. Right?

969
00:54:05.730 --> 00:54:10.730
So then it starts at those interest points or affinities and then the next tier

970
00:54:11.821 --> 00:54:16.740
grows out from there. But as long as that tight knit group,

971
00:54:17.650 --> 00:54:21.150
all right, so problem with gap, right? It's all people say, oh, it's all Nazis.

972
00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:23.370
Right? Well that's that tight knit

973
00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:28.710
<v 0>crew and just and tight knit group of Nazis sell a shirt says that</v>

974
00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:35.740
it's not just that though it's probably just that a hundred regular folks in one

975
00:54:35.741 --> 00:54:39.070
Nazi, that Nazi becomes the defining factor of the group. Right.

976
00:54:39.210 --> 00:54:40.060
There's Nazis in there.

977
00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:43.080
<v 2>Right. So you know, it's not that at all,</v>

978
00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:48.140
but there is a strong white nationalist movement that first gravitated over

979
00:54:49.591 --> 00:54:53.910
there. If he didn't have that, there would be no gap. Do you think so?

980
00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:58.910
I mean, I don't think so at all. Really? Yeah. Like whoa, whoa.

981
00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:01.410
Who would go there? People that got kicked off of Twitter,

982
00:55:01.530 --> 00:55:04.020
but the only people that got got kicked off Twitter in the early days with white

983
00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:07.620
nationalists. Well, who's the first people like w if you go back to them again,

984
00:55:07.621 --> 00:55:11.430
if, yeah, Gavin McInnes is an interesting character.

985
00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:16.250
<v 0>Not identify as a white nationalist. No, he does not.</v>

986
00:55:16.370 --> 00:55:19.580
And his wife is actually native American. He's,

987
00:55:19.610 --> 00:55:21.470
he's just made some sense

988
00:55:21.830 --> 00:55:23.030
<v 2>stupid choices. Right? Well,</v>

989
00:55:23.031 --> 00:55:26.010
I mean like baked Alaska was kind of thrown into that. Yeah.

990
00:55:26.070 --> 00:55:29.630
But he just like a meme maker. He's like, God makes funny memes.

991
00:55:29.770 --> 00:55:32.520
It's very funny. Right? Very entertaining. Um,

992
00:55:32.570 --> 00:55:35.140
but I think it comes down to WHO's dangerous or,

993
00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:35.970
<v 0>yeah. Well,</v>

994
00:55:35.970 --> 00:55:40.650
the proud boys became a dangerous idea because once you have a group and you

995
00:55:40.651 --> 00:55:41.920
don't control who joins the group,

996
00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:45.150
then assholes can join your group and then your group is made out of assholes

997
00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:47.440
and you're like, well, I didn't want it to be assholes. But what you'll,

998
00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:50.750
you'll let anybody in if you let anybody in a group. Yeah.

999
00:55:50.970 --> 00:55:52.800
I just have a joke about vegans about that.

1000
00:55:53.130 --> 00:55:55.230
The problem with any group is the same.

1001
00:55:55.231 --> 00:55:57.750
Like if you get any group of a hundred people,

1002
00:55:57.751 --> 00:55:58.890
if you're in a room with a hundred people,

1003
00:55:59.730 --> 00:56:02.610
what's the odds that one of them is going to be a fucking idiot? Well,

1004
00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:04.950
it's a hundred percent one of them's going to be a fucking idiot.

1005
00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:08.160
If you have 300 million people,

1006
00:56:08.460 --> 00:56:12.800
you're going to have by odds 3 million fucking idiots. Right.

1007
00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:17.520
And the joke was a lot of them are vegans. Yeah. Yeah. It doesn't, it's not,

1008
00:56:17.690 --> 00:56:20.130
there's anything wrong with vegans. It's Wa with a group.

1009
00:56:20.131 --> 00:56:21.480
And people just identify,

1010
00:56:21.481 --> 00:56:24.370
they get in that group and this is my group and I'm here to represent.

1011
00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:26.020
<v 2>And then it's just dummies.</v>

1012
00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:30.700
The thing with the proud boys is the ruling elite are afraid of men. You know,

1013
00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:34.270
it's a huge soy boy movement coming down at Gunn and put down a pipe, right?

1014
00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:37.720
I mean soy everywhere. If anybody's listening right now,

1015
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:41.440
everybody that's listening right now, soy is bad for you. It's not good.

1016
00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:46.480
It is very bad. It's processed nonsense. Estrogen. Oh yes. Well, it,

1017
00:56:46.481 --> 00:56:50.060
it uh, activates the phytoestrogens. No,

1018
00:56:50.310 --> 00:56:54.610
it has Actify phyto extractions that attack the endocrine endocrine gland

1019
00:56:54.611 --> 00:56:55.444
system.

1020
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:59.590
Now when you look at the endocrine gland system of people in the spiritual

1021
00:56:59.591 --> 00:56:59.891
world,

1022
00:56:59.891 --> 00:57:04.000
endocrine gland system is the physical manifestation of the so-called shockers.

1023
00:57:04.030 --> 00:57:06.160
Right now at the heart shock,

1024
00:57:06.161 --> 00:57:10.570
where what we have is called the thymus gland and the diamonds Glen is the one

1025
00:57:10.571 --> 00:57:13.300
that controls your sexual maturity.

1026
00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:18.250
And when you have an endocrine gland disrupter,

1027
00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:21.100
your sexual maturity is affected.

1028
00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:25.900
So a man who would ordinarily, like women now likes,

1029
00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:27.153
you see what I'm saying?

1030
00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:30.700
Wouldn't you have to massive quantities of soil for that? Take place.

1031
00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:33.940
That's that subjective based upon your biological structure. Right?

1032
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:37.690
I always think of it as more as like a fun thing to say. I don't think you know,

1033
00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:40.390
well he was a total fool. You turn into a bitch. Well here's the thing,

1034
00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:44.290
you can't go in the grocery store and find something that doesn't have. So

1035
00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:50.860
when you go look at your cheeses or your crackers, it was the say soy Lecithin,

1036
00:57:51.550 --> 00:57:55.090
soy and everything. So yeah, you were right. Uh,

1037
00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:59.200
they use it as Philip for some meats. So the whole Vegan movement, right?

1038
00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:03.520
You go and you go get your, your, your, your Vegan Burger Burger. Yeah. Right?

1039
00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:06.370
Uh, a lot of these burgers are soy based.

1040
00:58:06.970 --> 00:58:09.850
A lot of them are plant based for sure plant based oils. Right?

1041
00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:11.650
But so it's not good for you. Right.

1042
00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:13.750
And then you also look at the links between soil and cancer,

1043
00:58:13.751 --> 00:58:14.830
but that's a whole nother story.

1044
00:58:15.130 --> 00:58:19.510
But when you have something that's disrupting your so called shock Chris,

1045
00:58:20.350 --> 00:58:24.220
you can see how you can start affecting an entire population of people, right?

1046
00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:29.050
You start affecting their development at an early age. And then, you know,

1047
00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:33.340
you got these men who are, uh, acting like women who can't even, you know,

1048
00:58:33.370 --> 00:58:36.730
control their wives. You got some men out here that, uh,

1049
00:58:37.030 --> 00:58:41.610
let another man sleep with their girlfriend. Right. And, and, and, oh dear.

1050
00:58:42.190 --> 00:58:45.490
I don't know about here. We'll just say it out here. Well, when I say out here,

1051
00:58:45.491 --> 00:58:48.040
I mean it's everywhere in the world. Yeah. Yeah.

1052
00:58:48.250 --> 00:58:52.210
But isn't it just people just kinky in a weird shit? Well,

1053
00:58:53.110 --> 00:58:57.730
no, I don't think so. No. Wait, what do you think it is? I think it's pushed.

1054
00:58:57.731 --> 00:59:01.630
I think a doubletree's is highly pushed. Yeah. By who?

1055
00:59:02.410 --> 00:59:04.880
The ruling elite ruling class. I want to say really,

1056
00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:07.180
because they're not elite to sit around and go, you know what we need to do?

1057
00:59:07.181 --> 00:59:10.160
We need to push the Boucher. Well, when you look at, uh,

1058
00:59:10.250 --> 00:59:15.130
the degradation of a Russia right before the Bolshevik revolution,

1059
00:59:15.460 --> 00:59:20.080
what they do is they come in first, uh, with alcohol, right?

1060
00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:24.080
So they purchase hops and your barley and he produced alcohol.

1061
00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:27.740
Then what they do is they sell to alcohol to the farmer on credit cause he ain't

1062
00:59:27.741 --> 00:59:29.330
got no money. Right. Cause he'd been drunk.

1063
00:59:29.331 --> 00:59:32.450
He hasn't been producing a crops like he should. He falls into credit,

1064
00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:35.540
he falls into debt when he falls into the debt, he's now a slave to the land.

1065
00:59:35.541 --> 00:59:40.541
He wants old now and I can sell a whatever I want to his population or give this

1066
00:59:42.231 --> 00:59:45.170
population whatever I want because they are now technically my slave.

1067
00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:49.310
But in order to rule a nation of people,

1068
00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:53.840
you have to destroy morality. You have to destroy integrity. So you,

1069
00:59:53.841 --> 00:59:56.090
you feed them drugs, alcohol and sex,

1070
00:59:57.590 --> 00:59:59.090
and then tear apart the family.

1071
01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:05.040
<v 3>Do you think that that's just a natural progression of people's Slovenly</v>

1072
01:00:05.261 --> 01:00:08.920
instincts or do you think that some sort of a grand plan have a slovenly

1073
01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:12.160
instinct? Some people do. Yeah. I think some people are lazy in,

1074
01:00:12.161 --> 01:00:15.250
some people are weak and some people are greedy and some people just,

1075
01:00:16.210 --> 01:00:18.610
they lean towards,

1076
01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:24.360
they lean towards just pleasure without sacrifice and discipline because it's

1077
01:00:25.451 --> 01:00:27.760
easy and they just lay in bed and jerk off.

1078
01:00:27.761 --> 01:00:28.810
I don't think anybody's telling them.

1079
01:00:28.811 --> 01:00:32.440
I don't think there's any sinister government manipulating their strings that

1080
01:00:32.441 --> 01:00:34.390
makes them watch porn all day. I think they just,

1081
01:00:34.550 --> 01:00:37.850
<v 2>yeah, it actually, you know Instagram is a gateway to porn.</v>

1082
01:00:38.690 --> 01:00:43.460
Instagram. You can't go on Instagram without looking at some booty, right? Yeah,

1083
01:00:43.461 --> 01:00:44.070
but it's also

1084
01:00:44.070 --> 01:00:48.090
<v 3>gateway to sunsets and people's kids and muscle cars.</v>

1085
01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:53.170
<v 2>Come on Joe. Cool. Shit. Ain't nobody going on Instagram as sunset.</v>

1086
01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:55.870
People are going to Instagram and look at booty. There's a lot of that.

1087
01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:00.760
No Dog Yoga community has went from, hey,

1088
01:01:00.790 --> 01:01:05.440
check out my Bakasana to check out my backside pants.

1089
01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:10.600
Right? A lot of yoga pants, pigs, foodie, foodie booty. Just booty alone.

1090
01:01:10.601 --> 01:01:14.290
It's an industry. It is a giant industry on Instagram. Yeah,

1091
01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:19.210
so what happens is you wake up in the morning, you check your notifications,

1092
01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:23.620
then your homie tags you. Oh, look at this chick poem right now.

1093
01:01:23.621 --> 01:01:25.980
You have an erection. What's the first thing you do? You're like, oh,

1094
01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:29.830
let me go to my browser. Open an incognito browser and hit pornhub. Boom.

1095
01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:32.350
Now you're Outta here right now. Your Day's done.

1096
01:01:32.351 --> 01:01:34.240
You just depleted your yet energy. Right.

1097
01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:36.460
And this coming out of my book where I talk about, you know,

1098
01:01:36.461 --> 01:01:38.740
why you sent jerk off and all that stuff, but you right.

1099
01:01:38.830 --> 01:01:43.630
That you shouldn't jerk off. Yeah. Yeah. Never. Uh, well there's a calculation.

1100
01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:49.870
You have a jerk-off algorithm. Yeah. There's a jerk-off algorithm. Uh,

1101
01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:53.590
it's a created by the tower, the tower stuff, sexology.

1102
01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:59.400
And I think it's your age times to know your age divided by two times.

1103
01:01:59.861 --> 01:02:02.990
100. I forget what it is. It's in my book. I can't remember it. Uh,

1104
01:02:03.010 --> 01:02:06.250
but I got it from the towel. Right. Which is why I don't have it memorized.

1105
01:02:07.810 --> 01:02:10.900
Time Point Age Times 0.2. I think it's age times 0.2. Um,

1106
01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:16.030
and then it tells you how many days. Right? So at my age, I'm 38 now my age,

1107
01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:19.030
it's about seven and a half days between ejaculation to,

1108
01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:23.880
to maintain who I am. Really? Yeah. And Dam.

1109
01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:28.410
Yes. So our main strength is his balls, right? That's right.

1110
01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:31.440
It's every time you deplete yourself, you're not the same man anymore.

1111
01:02:31.441 --> 01:02:32.790
You lose your superpowers.

1112
01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:38.340
Now when you lose your superpowers to some, you know,

1113
01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:41.880
igg model, it's not even worthy.

1114
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:46.890
Your orgasm doesn't feel the same as a natural interaction with a woman.

1115
01:02:47.070 --> 01:02:50.840
Right. You know what I mean? True. So you're wasting your superpower on,

1116
01:02:50.841 --> 01:02:53.250
on like a fictional fantasy.

1117
01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:57.320
So you're wasting a percentage of your vital energy, your,

1118
01:02:57.330 --> 01:03:01.290
your final energy as well as the proteins and minerals and zinc and magnesium

1119
01:03:01.291 --> 01:03:04.320
and all that stuff that you know is lost. Yeah. You know,

1120
01:03:04.350 --> 01:03:07.020
I think it's equivalent to like two New York strip steaks, eggs,

1121
01:03:07.021 --> 01:03:11.160
oranges and apples or something like that. Really? Oh yes. A lot of vitamins.

1122
01:03:11.330 --> 01:03:15.520
So I have a one on the size of the loads. You shoot though. No. Oh, you

1123
01:03:18.030 --> 01:03:21.270
should swallow. Whoa. Jesus ladies. I'm sorry.

1124
01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:25.500
That's why you should ingest it.

1125
01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:30.870
If the man is healthy because it's a, it's a full meal. It's a full meal.

1126
01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:34.140
It's a full meal of of nutrients that Amanda man loses.

1127
01:03:34.750 --> 01:03:38.760
There's a vial available that way. One of them has done studies.

1128
01:03:39.330 --> 01:03:42.720
We should to have a bet people have done like nutrition slash load studies.

1129
01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:45.120
Probably a startup out there like trying to do this right now,

1130
01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:46.320
calculate into an app.

1131
01:03:51.470 --> 01:03:55.590
<v 0>Where's this conversation going now? What are we talking about?</v>

1132
01:03:55.920 --> 01:04:00.060
Manipulating you, turning you into a soy boy? [inaudible] it's you.

1133
01:04:00.061 --> 01:04:01.860
You think there's actual, so this is where we differ.

1134
01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:04.410
You think there's actual manipulation taking place?

1135
01:04:04.411 --> 01:04:06.060
I think it's just natural instincts.

1136
01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:11.130
And then I think that people see it around them and then they cater to those

1137
01:04:11.131 --> 01:04:14.010
natural instincts and then they support those natural instincts.

1138
01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:18.570
But I think people have a natural instinct to be undisciplined and lazy and just

1139
01:04:18.571 --> 01:04:21.570
gratuitous and you know, yeah.

1140
01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:25.290
Dive into pleasure before sacrifice and commitment.

1141
01:04:25.291 --> 01:04:28.900
And so are we making excuses for not making excuses? I think it's a,

1142
01:04:29.550 --> 01:04:32.220
also the softness of the world we live in. Oh yeah.

1143
01:04:32.370 --> 01:04:36.060
Maybe we live in this incredibly easy to get buy in world, right?

1144
01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:38.670
You know where the poor people are fat. Yeah.

1145
01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:42.660
There's never been a time in history where poor people are fat. Yeah. Yeah.

1146
01:04:42.850 --> 01:04:46.830
That, that comes down to an actual food. Yeah. So-Called. It's certainly,

1147
01:04:46.831 --> 01:04:50.040
that is certainly the food is garbage, but it's also that,

1148
01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:54.940
well, there's this strange lack of discipline because it's not,

1149
01:04:54.990 --> 01:04:57.480
it's not necessarily I have to do is just show up to your job,

1150
01:04:57.810 --> 01:05:01.260
put in the least amount of effort you can without getting fired and you can

1151
01:05:01.261 --> 01:05:02.670
exist. Right. That didn't,

1152
01:05:02.790 --> 01:05:06.030
that didn't happen in the wild world when people are hunters and gatherers.

1153
01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:08.970
If you didn't put a hundred percent effort, if you didn't really struggle,

1154
01:05:08.971 --> 01:05:11.820
you didn't make it and you weren't a benefit to the tribe and they kicked your

1155
01:05:11.821 --> 01:05:14.340
ass out and you got eaten. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1156
01:05:14.341 --> 01:05:18.220
That's how it's supposed to be. I do agree with that. Yeah. I do agree that, um,

1157
01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:23.320
<v 2>discipline is, is, you know what we have to demand from people and you know,</v>

1158
01:05:24.250 --> 01:05:28.840
um, but you know, your, your culture has to recognize about your Ian and,

1159
01:05:29.290 --> 01:05:33.370
and shun it and ban it and say like, Hey, you know, we don't want this here.

1160
01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:36.640
You know what I mean? Um, uh,

1161
01:05:36.670 --> 01:05:39.970
porn is readily available on Twitter and watch it right in your feet.

1162
01:05:39.971 --> 01:05:41.180
Sometimes I'm scrolling my feet.

1163
01:05:42.310 --> 01:05:45.480
<v 0>Oh, that's a weird thing about Twitter, isn't it? That it's a giant platform,</v>

1164
01:05:45.481 --> 01:05:47.160
but they allow porn. Yeah.

1165
01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:50.760
So you know when I had jack on with Tim Pool and I think Tim pulled,

1166
01:05:50.761 --> 01:05:54.110
didn't even know that porn was legal on it. Yeah. Right. So that I showed that.

1167
01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:56.970
Yeah. I have found that a little bit of information,

1168
01:05:57.330 --> 01:05:59.420
I don't know how accurate it is. Pools, Twitter use no.

1169
01:05:59.430 --> 01:06:03.570
On the ejaculation frequency. Yes. Recommended by the towels.

1170
01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:08.850
It said the most respected of the Tau theorists son Sim meow [inaudible] quoted

1171
01:06:08.851 --> 01:06:13.440
above recommends ejaculation no more than once every 20 days for men over 50

1172
01:06:13.770 --> 01:06:18.600
cheeses and no more than once every hundred days for men over 60 with that I

1173
01:06:18.601 --> 01:06:22.530
should be dead. Okay. And it has to do with it says no energy.

1174
01:06:22.531 --> 01:06:23.490
How am I getting everything done?

1175
01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:27.480
You're getting AIDS retarding hormones as you're about to ejaculate.

1176
01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:31.860
And then there's a level you want to keep before you ejaculate.

1177
01:06:31.890 --> 01:06:36.870
So balance what your before you excrete the hormones. That's what it's saying.

1178
01:06:36.930 --> 01:06:38.760
So tantra real quick. Yeah, I think so.

1179
01:06:38.761 --> 01:06:41.220
I think that's what it's supposed to come and turn on.

1180
01:06:41.410 --> 01:06:44.580
This is a level you can like optimize yourself.

1181
01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:47.280
[inaudible] lets people out of their fucking minds.

1182
01:06:47.281 --> 01:06:49.160
I'm trying to get rid of this shit. I,

1183
01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:53.190
I've always said that it helps you think because too many times with a man,

1184
01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:56.880
your, your mind is clouded by sexual desire.

1185
01:06:56.881 --> 01:06:59.040
If you could just jerk off and then you can think clearly.

1186
01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:01.710
I was telling her you saw a bit about it.

1187
01:07:01.711 --> 01:07:05.430
I say jerk off first then think about it like if you jerk off and then you want

1188
01:07:05.431 --> 01:07:06.840
to call a girl, it's because you love her.

1189
01:07:07.170 --> 01:07:10.980
You're not just trying to fuck you actually. Oh, like her as a human being.

1190
01:07:10.981 --> 01:07:12.030
You want to be around her.

1191
01:07:12.031 --> 01:07:14.340
You don't just be wanting to want to be around it for sex.

1192
01:07:14.370 --> 01:07:15.990
You actually really love her.

1193
01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:20.860
<v 2>Yeah. I think there's a level of discipline. Right? So, um, yeah.</v>

1194
01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:25.450
If you go about to make that, that risky text message, yeah.

1195
01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:28.340
You might want to shoot your low and assess it. Right?

1196
01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:32.620
I'm talking about like what the f I'm going to watch him fucking documentary.

1197
01:07:33.030 --> 01:07:36.730
Put that phone down. But that's for an undisciplined man. Yes.

1198
01:07:37.330 --> 01:07:42.220
So a discipline man's gonna say, no, I'm not gonna send this thirst trap,

1199
01:07:42.310 --> 01:07:44.680
you know, uh, this, this thirsty comment,

1200
01:07:44.950 --> 01:07:48.760
I'm going to stay disciplined in who I am because in order to get the woman I

1201
01:07:48.761 --> 01:07:51.300
have to stay away from the woman, you know,

1202
01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:54.960
in order to get the woman I have to stay away from the woman. Yeah. And, and,

1203
01:07:54.961 --> 01:07:59.860
and, and, and keeping your, you're at your vital man.

1204
01:07:59.861 --> 01:08:03.340
Energy for me keeps me like on edge.

1205
01:08:03.370 --> 01:08:06.970
Like I'm always like an animal, you know what I mean? Um,

1206
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.840
because I want to release. Right. See what I'm saying. So, um,

1207
01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:16.140
what I do is I'll work up that energy and then channeling

1208
01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:20.270
<v 0>into work. Hmm. I'll just immediately pull my laptop out and just bang out.</v>

1209
01:08:20.570 --> 01:08:23.090
Cause it's like that frustration there and then just you got to release it that

1210
01:08:23.091 --> 01:08:25.480
way. Or I'll go running, I'll go work out what I'm saying.

1211
01:08:25.790 --> 01:08:30.230
But when I get around, women would have full sack.

1212
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.630
Oh, I'm not the same as when I'm empty. Yes. And they see,

1213
01:08:35.631 --> 01:08:39.080
you can see the difference in how they attracted you. You sit up different,

1214
01:08:39.081 --> 01:08:42.080
your chest pokes out. When you're around other men,

1215
01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:46.340
you're like a little bit more edgy. Yeah. You know what I mean?

1216
01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:51.410
After you blow your load, you're kind of like chilled out. Yay. On competitive.

1217
01:08:51.411 --> 01:08:55.460
Noncompetitive. Yeah. Interesting. You hold on to that like fighters,

1218
01:08:55.461 --> 01:08:59.840
you know how to fight the fight. Mike Tyson never did that. My Tyson said, no,

1219
01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:02.180
I always like to come with me. Went to the Pothole Fund.

1220
01:09:02.270 --> 01:09:06.290
I'm not distracted and just shoot as low as and then beat the fuck out of

1221
01:09:06.291 --> 01:09:09.410
everybody. But I think Mike had a lot of extra loads.

1222
01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:10.970
I think if you had to guess,

1223
01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:16.460
it's the level he was just a ultra man. You know there was,

1224
01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:18.560
it was not a regular man.

1225
01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:23.240
This is a research published by the US National Library of medicine and National

1226
01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:25.760
Institutes of health found that after seven days of not a jacket waiting,

1227
01:09:25.761 --> 01:09:30.650
men's testosterone levels reached 145.7% of the baseline.

1228
01:09:31.970 --> 01:09:36.970
The interesting thing is that they didn't observe significant fluctuations from

1229
01:09:37.401 --> 01:09:39.770
the baseline. On days two through five.

1230
01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:44.750
The research also showed that the peak levels were at day seven. Yeah.

1231
01:09:44.810 --> 01:09:48.850
Risks Dow. It's actually Dow by the way. It's t a. O. It's a,

1232
01:09:49.070 --> 01:09:52.220
it's you say it as Dow, the Dow of g condo.

1233
01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:54.890
Risks of too frequent ejaculation.

1234
01:09:54.891 --> 01:09:58.820
When sex is performed with the recommended Dow frequency,

1235
01:09:59.090 --> 01:10:03.770
it becomes an inexhaustible source of energy like a well that never runs dry.

1236
01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:05.480
However,

1237
01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:09.860
when ejaculation frequency exceeds the capacity of the body to fully replenish

1238
01:10:09.861 --> 01:10:13.820
the seaman man could experience chronic fatigue, low resistance,

1239
01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:17.180
loss of sex drive, lots of focus and irritability.

1240
01:10:17.181 --> 01:10:22.160
Longterm excessive exam ejaculation can cause chronic low zinc conditions which

1241
01:10:22.161 --> 01:10:23.990
can cause chronic fatigue,

1242
01:10:24.170 --> 01:10:27.770
mental confusion and significant loss of sexual drive.

1243
01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:30.020
But what have your with a freak like that girl will.

1244
01:10:30.021 --> 01:10:33.170
Harris was talking about my friend will house was in here the other day and he

1245
01:10:33.171 --> 01:10:36.370
was saying he a human. He used to meet these girls and [inaudible].

1246
01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:41.210
Oh it's also considered harmful to ejaculate when ill drunk or go gorge with

1247
01:10:41.211 --> 01:10:44.900
food. Whoa. Here's the next, the next line. Oh which one?

1248
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:49.430
Ejaculation control and discipline is not to be confused with the frequency of

1249
01:10:49.431 --> 01:10:53.930
sex. There are significant physiologic fizz.

1250
01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:57.590
What's that word? Physiological. There's supposed to be a period there. Oh,

1251
01:10:58.490 --> 01:11:01.040
physiological therapeutic benefits to having sex.

1252
01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:06.460
Frequent sex intercourse maintains a man's interest in the acts as well as his

1253
01:11:06.741 --> 01:11:11.660
capacity to continue indefinitely until his is fully satisfied.

1254
01:11:11.810 --> 01:11:14.100
So they're saying fuck, but don't come. Yes. Those

1255
01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:18.270
<v 2>people out of their fucking mind. I come every time I fuck Yo. I, I used to uh,</v>

1256
01:11:18.430 --> 01:11:20.590
try and get rid of this stuff. I used to fuck with three words.

1257
01:11:20.670 --> 01:11:24.230
I used to fuck with girls heads like that. We would not come. Yeah. Really?

1258
01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:28.260
They start crying. Wow. I had a girl like straight down and break up cry.

1259
01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:31.830
I can't please you. Is it me? Is it? Nah, I'm just like, no.

1260
01:11:31.831 --> 01:11:34.830
I just wanted you to be happy. How you feel? Feel good. Good.

1261
01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:39.060
Then I go when I hit the laptop and it just shows a musette. Oh really?

1262
01:11:39.690 --> 01:11:40.290
Oh Katie let at him.

1263
01:11:40.290 --> 01:11:44.520
He loved it because like nature wants them to get you to come. Yes.

1264
01:11:44.590 --> 01:11:49.080
Women only respected discipline, man. You don't. Once true,

1265
01:11:49.170 --> 01:11:53.550
once a woman can drop your defenses, she's no longer attracted to you.

1266
01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:56.400
If she can control you, she's not attracted to you.

1267
01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:58.530
A woman wants a man she could chase. In my book,

1268
01:11:58.531 --> 01:12:00.420
I talk about how women are the Apex Predator.

1269
01:12:00.421 --> 01:12:03.840
They're the ones that chase after sex. I mean, they can have sex endlessly,

1270
01:12:03.870 --> 01:12:06.660
right? Once we know it's like we're pretty much done. Like,

1271
01:12:06.690 --> 01:12:09.360
I mean you me a couple of minutes to recharge, but they could keep going.

1272
01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:13.110
You know what I'm saying? So they're, you know, technically like, you know,

1273
01:12:13.111 --> 01:12:14.010
freaks or whatever,

1274
01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:19.580
but just because she's undisciplined in her sexual energy doesn't mean you have

1275
01:12:19.591 --> 01:12:20.310
to be.

1276
01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:23.880
And if she feels like she has to go outside of the relationship to go get her

1277
01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:27.090
fixed, that's on her. That has nothing to do with you.

1278
01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:30.210
Your aspirations as a man are higher than sex.

1279
01:12:30.750 --> 01:12:33.960
A woman's role is to create life and support the man.

1280
01:12:34.170 --> 01:12:37.940
The man's role is to create the, the, the,

1281
01:12:37.941 --> 01:12:41.460
the afforded and the future of, of humanity. You know,

1282
01:12:41.461 --> 01:12:43.110
building things and innovating.

1283
01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:46.740
And it's true that a woman is not attracted to a guy without discipline.

1284
01:12:46.770 --> 01:12:51.360
Like Glenn men are lazy and weak. That is a giant turnoff to a woman.

1285
01:12:51.690 --> 01:12:55.890
But if a woman is hot, she could be pretty lazy. Absolutely.

1286
01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:59.270
They are the laziest people level. We don't care. Men don't see,

1287
01:12:59.310 --> 01:13:03.750
I don't care if a girl's lazy. She's hot. Well, a lot these, her body holds up.

1288
01:13:04.010 --> 01:13:07.400
Why she can get to the gym. I used to make girls work to get me, man. Real.

1289
01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:10.830
Yeah. Like, you know, I would say I'm, you know, I'm working on this project.

1290
01:13:10.831 --> 01:13:13.290
You know, I'm gonna send you a spreadsheet over. I need you to go organize it.

1291
01:13:14.010 --> 01:13:15.690
And if she'd say no, I just be like, all right,

1292
01:13:15.691 --> 01:13:18.630
well you're worthless to my life. I need,

1293
01:13:18.631 --> 01:13:20.010
I need somebody that's going to build with me. Right.

1294
01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:22.920
What if she's building her own shit? Fuck her shit.

1295
01:13:25.650 --> 01:13:29.460
Go pilcher shit. You know, if you need help, I'll help you. But you know,

1296
01:13:29.970 --> 01:13:33.960
she want to partner. Yeah. Want just a lover. That's what you're saying. No,

1297
01:13:34.770 --> 01:13:39.510
no. You want someone to help you. No. I want her to prove her worth. Whoa.

1298
01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:42.420
She gotta be worried to get me like, you know,

1299
01:13:42.450 --> 01:13:45.750
it's easy to get a girl then he's going get them. Good man. You know,

1300
01:13:45.870 --> 01:13:47.730
you only gonna find one hotel. Jesus in your life.

1301
01:13:47.731 --> 01:13:49.980
I could find a ton of you shorty. Wow.

1302
01:13:50.010 --> 01:13:53.250
You everywhere on Instagram after Joe Rogan is going to be,

1303
01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:57.270
they going to be everywhere. So,

1304
01:13:57.810 --> 01:14:02.550
but now some would say that that's a sexist generalization. Sure.

1305
01:14:03.690 --> 01:14:05.090
I don't care what the, I care. Look,

1306
01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:08.260
you can have that conversation like you and your platform. We can talk and I'll,

1307
01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:10.920
you know, if you want to call it sexist, it is what it,

1308
01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:12.100
have you ever had a conversation

1309
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:14.680
<v 1>with like a radical feminist about this kind of thinking? No,</v>

1310
01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:16.510
they won't talk to me. They all blocked me.

1311
01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:20.350
They block you Yale and he all black, you know the whole,

1312
01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:22.540
the whole black left feminist.

1313
01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:25.420
The reason why they blocked me is cause they can't beat me. Right.

1314
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:27.310
When we have conversations,

1315
01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:31.480
I'm so objective that it's too dangerous for them to engage with me. How so?

1316
01:14:32.590 --> 01:14:36.250
Cause I'll be like, it's sexist. Yes. And so let's,

1317
01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:40.330
let's continue the conversation and then that's where they don't want to go,

1318
01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:43.150
cause then they're going to have to provide reinforcement and evidence and

1319
01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:46.210
they're dealing with an educated man and I'm going to come with my evidence and

1320
01:14:46.211 --> 01:14:49.600
facts so you don't have a problem being sexist.

1321
01:14:49.601 --> 01:14:53.140
That's what the problem is because if someone calls you sexist and you go, yeah,

1322
01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:55.980
yeah, I'm sexist. Yeah, it is what it is. It's like a,

1323
01:14:55.981 --> 01:14:59.560
somebody called me a racist or whatever. I don't care what your opinion is.

1324
01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:03.940
I don't care about these isms that you create. I understand nature.

1325
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.570
I understand myself. That's an interesting thing that I see today.

1326
01:15:07.940 --> 01:15:12.940
This I find really strange is that people that are denying evolutionary biology,

1327
01:15:12.941 --> 01:15:16.420
I mean there's yeah, decades of research being done,

1328
01:15:16.421 --> 01:15:19.600
why people behave the way they behave, what women are attracted to,

1329
01:15:19.601 --> 01:15:23.020
what men are attracted to and what the spectrum is, and then they say,

1330
01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:25.330
scientists racist. Yeah. That's what it's weird.

1331
01:15:25.331 --> 01:15:27.760
Science is sexist to fuck your science.

1332
01:15:27.910 --> 01:15:32.910
It's fucking fascinating to me when people don't want to look at it because it

1333
01:15:33.131 --> 01:15:36.790
doesn't support their ideology. They want to deny all this research,

1334
01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:41.200
deny all these really objective geniuses that have been studying all this stuff.

1335
01:15:41.201 --> 01:15:45.880
And the best minds in the field have come to these conclusions based on just

1336
01:15:46.510 --> 01:15:51.430
insurmountable amounts of data. Not Interested. Duh. So fine.

1337
01:15:51.620 --> 01:15:55.360
I'll put Sharky I have a shirt that says I am the patriarchy.

1338
01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:00.370
You know, like no matter what you throw at me, I'm just going to embrace it.

1339
01:16:00.371 --> 01:16:02.650
I'm going to show, yeah, Israel, there is a patriarchy.

1340
01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:03.970
There's also a matriarchy.

1341
01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:07.480
You need to handle your matriarchy and stop worrying about the patriarchy.

1342
01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:11.050
Cause if you handled your matriarchy to patriarchy wouldn't be your problem.

1343
01:16:11.590 --> 01:16:12.940
Your problem is you don't have to be a woman.

1344
01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:17.410
What do you think is a good piece of advice for women on how to be a woman?

1345
01:16:18.070 --> 01:16:21.700
A good piece of violence. Like woman Hotep hotep teaches women.

1346
01:16:22.090 --> 01:16:26.800
Hotep teaches women what's good, emotional control. Emotional control.

1347
01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:31.330
And uh, so, so the number one problem I see with women is a,

1348
01:16:32.650 --> 01:16:37.360
um, damn slot here. Right? Um, all right, let's go here. Okay.

1349
01:16:40.090 --> 01:16:44.080
Women let their friends, they tell their friends they business. Yes.

1350
01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:47.550
Stopped. Stop telling your friends your, but it stopped you.

1351
01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:49.120
Like when I have problems with it,

1352
01:16:49.170 --> 01:16:52.900
you know my girl or you know in the past when I have problems with women,

1353
01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:57.400
I didn't run back Yogis with Moodle. Oh man, we don't do that.

1354
01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:01.180
If my friends do that, they better be laughing. Right?

1355
01:17:01.510 --> 01:17:04.510
If my friend goes to it, he's not going to believe what this shit said to me.

1356
01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:06.210
If they give you a hard time about it,

1357
01:17:06.211 --> 01:17:09.230
but if they go to the new MOOC wants me to quit my job, like, hey

1358
01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:15.230
<v 2>don't do that to me, man. Put that shit on me. Yeah. You know, I'm so, so,</v>

1359
01:17:15.231 --> 01:17:18.850
so I think women also, you have to understand that they're,

1360
01:17:18.851 --> 01:17:23.480
they're giving this information to a friend who is also single.

1361
01:17:23.810 --> 01:17:26.960
When a woman gets in a relationship, she loses her friend, right?

1362
01:17:27.410 --> 01:17:29.780
Cause now you have less time to spend with your bestie. So the best,

1363
01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:31.380
he's jealous of the relationship.

1364
01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:34.640
So whenever you go back and tell her she's never going to give you sound advice.

1365
01:17:34.670 --> 01:17:36.560
True. She's always going to take your side.

1366
01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:38.570
So you have to judge your friends and say, well,

1367
01:17:38.571 --> 01:17:41.690
if I'm giving this information to my friend and see an objective friend or she,

1368
01:17:41.691 --> 01:17:45.800
a subject of French is going to feed my ego and then you can't analyze that on

1369
01:17:45.801 --> 01:17:48.170
your own, then you'll never have peace in your relationship.

1370
01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:51.530
Cause the worst thing to do is here's the problem in relationships built on

1371
01:17:51.531 --> 01:17:52.100
trust.

1372
01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:54.920
So if a man and a woman come together and you tell all my business to your

1373
01:17:54.921 --> 01:17:58.910
friend, where's the trust? Where's our privacy? We have none, right?

1374
01:17:58.911 --> 01:18:00.680
We have none. We don't have a relationship.

1375
01:18:00.681 --> 01:18:03.680
You have a relationship with your friend. So go be with your friend.

1376
01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:07.880
I don't got time to be, you know, I, something happens in my personal life.

1377
01:18:07.881 --> 01:18:11.690
I'm going to go tell this strange girl what happened in my personal life.

1378
01:18:11.691 --> 01:18:15.200
Something I told you that was private to relate it to something else that could

1379
01:18:15.201 --> 01:18:17.930
be happening in our relationship. You know what I mean? It's a thing.

1380
01:18:17.931 --> 01:18:21.470
We have different instincts. Women have the instinct to gossip. They love it.

1381
01:18:21.860 --> 01:18:25.810
It comes from that hunter gatherer culture where back in the day that's what

1382
01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:26.421
would happen.

1383
01:18:26.421 --> 01:18:29.450
The men would go out and try to hunt the food and the women would stay home and

1384
01:18:29.451 --> 01:18:33.770
they would talk shit. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Again, discipline yourself. Women.

1385
01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:38.300
Yeah. Stuff ladies. Another thing, get a hobby healthy one.

1386
01:18:39.230 --> 01:18:43.160
Women don't have hobbies. Their hobbies are all in consumer consumerism.

1387
01:18:43.220 --> 01:18:46.120
Don't have hobbies. Oh, all of them. All not, not all.

1388
01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:48.500
Oh I know women with hobbies, all of them.

1389
01:18:51.620 --> 01:18:54.950
But you know, in my book I say, you know, say all because it gets to people.

1390
01:18:54.951 --> 01:18:58.520
Go get some upset. Yeah. It gets people going. Cause they always go, well, no,

1391
01:18:58.521 --> 01:19:01.370
it's so dumb. It's like I know it's some Jamar around, you know what I'm saying?

1392
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:06.080
But I say, oh just to get people going. But majority women don't have hobbies,

1393
01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:11.180
you know, do something that is uh, cause they're inundated with advertising.

1394
01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:15.410
You know, their hobbies become consumerism and Oh, you know,

1395
01:19:15.411 --> 01:19:19.040
retail therapy or you know, I do makeup for fun. No,

1396
01:19:19.041 --> 01:19:22.820
you don't do makeup for fun. That's not what you do. That's not a hobby.

1397
01:19:22.821 --> 01:19:27.020
Makeup's not a hobby. I'm sorry ladies. A hobby is something that develops your,

1398
01:19:27.021 --> 01:19:29.780
your individual person, something that makes you better.

1399
01:19:30.970 --> 01:19:33.690
Some kind of a discipline as some kind of form. Right.

1400
01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:37.910
Some way to express yourself. Some physical thing that you do. Yeah.

1401
01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:42.080
Like so like one of my hobbies is chess, right? That helps me focus when I,

1402
01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:45.590
when I see that my attention span is getting short,

1403
01:19:45.591 --> 01:19:47.360
cause I spent too much time on social media.

1404
01:19:47.570 --> 01:19:52.250
I go to chess and I'll spend time on chess to bring that back to reality.

1405
01:19:52.340 --> 01:19:55.260
You play physical chest. Would you play online? Uh, online? Yeah,

1406
01:19:55.370 --> 01:19:59.920
I can do OTB but you know, I do most OTB over the board.

1407
01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:04.460
Oh, what's that means? Physical, that's what you call it. Yeah. It's called OTB.

1408
01:20:04.620 --> 01:20:08.130
You do speed chess. We hit the timer. Do you do regular chess? Well, online,

1409
01:20:08.131 --> 01:20:11.130
I do speeches. I do a five minute games.

1410
01:20:11.580 --> 01:20:14.740
<v 3>That's impressive. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, it's a whole nother woman.</v>

1411
01:20:14.741 --> 01:20:16.680
Scared of chess. I've always been scared of other,

1412
01:20:16.710 --> 01:20:21.360
I have an obsession with games, real problems. And chess is a, it's one of them.

1413
01:20:21.420 --> 01:20:23.640
I've, I've played it a little bit, but I'm like, fuck,

1414
01:20:23.641 --> 01:20:24.870
this could take over my life.

1415
01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:29.610
<v 2>It would. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, I'm a, if I'm not careful,</v>

1416
01:20:29.940 --> 01:20:34.560
I'll be sleeping and, and playing chess. Oh yeah. You know,

1417
01:20:34.561 --> 01:20:36.060
like sometimes I'll be chilling,

1418
01:20:36.061 --> 01:20:39.360
like we'll be having a conversation and I'll space out and be doing chest

1419
01:20:39.361 --> 01:20:43.920
problems in my head. Uh, so that happens sometimes, you know, a lot,

1420
01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:46.880
especially on days that I play a lot of chess. I remember

1421
01:20:47.270 --> 01:20:50.620
<v 3>it's terms really getting into Chesney was taking private lessons he was talking</v>

1422
01:20:50.621 --> 01:20:54.070
about all the time. And I think he found the same thing. Do you remember that?

1423
01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:56.920
I think he found the same thing. I think he just got too obsessed with it.

1424
01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.420
He's like, I can't fucking do this anymore.

1425
01:20:58.650 --> 01:21:02.850
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah. Well, one of my life goals is to be a chess master one day. Yeah.</v>

1426
01:21:02.970 --> 01:21:05.070
Yeah. You know? And when you say chess master,

1427
01:21:05.071 --> 01:21:07.140
what do you have to do to be a master? Okay.

1428
01:21:07.141 --> 01:21:10.980
So you have national master and then you have a international master and then

1429
01:21:10.981 --> 01:21:14.730
you have a game master or the GM, I forget what it's called.

1430
01:21:15.030 --> 01:21:18.930
A national master. You have to participate in,

1431
01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:23.460
I believe one of the tournament's, one of the, uh, I forget the federation. Um,

1432
01:21:23.790 --> 01:21:27.030
but you have to enter one of these tournaments and you have to place a certain,

1433
01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:31.110
uh, you know, I think it's maybe top two or top three at a certain tournament.

1434
01:21:31.230 --> 01:21:34.290
Don't quote me on this stuff, but you have to go through the tournament.

1435
01:21:34.291 --> 01:21:35.910
And I think in order to become international,

1436
01:21:35.911 --> 01:21:39.300
you have to first become national master and then national match.

1437
01:21:39.301 --> 01:21:43.710
You can go be international, if I'm not mistaken. And then, you know, GM,

1438
01:21:44.190 --> 01:21:47.880
<v 3>do you ever see the video of Eddie Fisher or Bobby Fischer?</v>

1439
01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:52.890
When Bobby Fischer was walking down this row of chess games,

1440
01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:56.340
he was playing like 10 different games simultaneously.

1441
01:21:56.480 --> 01:22:01.370
<v 2>Yeah. Um, uh, the, the, the, the champ now, uh, Carlson,</v>

1442
01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:06.410
uh, does something similar, uh, where Carlson will, uh, play, you know,

1443
01:22:06.411 --> 01:22:07.210
several people

1444
01:22:07.210 --> 01:22:10.840
<v 3>full or he'll play without a board. That always interested me.</v>

1445
01:22:10.930 --> 01:22:14.560
I've seen people do that. Yeah. This dude I knew who went to prison,

1446
01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:19.060
was playing with his pool holiday's play out in white plains executive

1447
01:22:19.061 --> 01:22:22.270
billiards. And this kid was a chess master. He's like a 16 year old,

1448
01:22:22.271 --> 01:22:27.010
I don't know, master music, chess genius, 16 year old kid. Um,

1449
01:22:27.070 --> 01:22:30.190
and he was playing with this dude who was like in his forties who had been in

1450
01:22:30.191 --> 01:22:33.160
prison. He learned how to play chess with no board in prison.

1451
01:22:33.370 --> 01:22:36.040
So they was just sitting across from each other talking,

1452
01:22:36.230 --> 01:22:40.180
saying the moves and then they would both like recognize where the pieces were

1453
01:22:40.181 --> 01:22:42.040
on the board. Yeah. Really interesting.

1454
01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:44.150
<v 2>Yeah. I mean that,</v>

1455
01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:49.430
that level of visualization is where humanity has to take itself.

1456
01:22:50.690 --> 01:22:51.021
You know?

1457
01:22:51.021 --> 01:22:55.340
That's why I say chess is great because it allows you to visualize and in order

1458
01:22:55.341 --> 01:22:56.960
to manifest your desires in this world,

1459
01:22:56.961 --> 01:23:00.410
you have to be able to visualize what you want. The more you can focus,

1460
01:23:00.411 --> 01:23:03.680
the more you can visualize, the better your mind is, I believe,

1461
01:23:04.310 --> 01:23:08.680
because our is based upon visualization. You see what I'm saying? Yeah.

1462
01:23:09.410 --> 01:23:14.350
Um, uh, women need to get back to that, to visualizing goals.

1463
01:23:14.380 --> 01:23:19.090
I think women are, are very spiritual. So, uh,

1464
01:23:19.150 --> 01:23:23.710
in Africa, this, this, uh, Oh man, I'm slipping on my studies. I studied,

1465
01:23:23.810 --> 01:23:26.140
it's a long time ago, but, uh,

1466
01:23:26.170 --> 01:23:31.170
the man is a holding the child and the woman is pointing up to the sky,

1467
01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:34.690
right? And it's like the man is like that earthly thing.

1468
01:23:34.691 --> 01:23:38.620
Like we handle things in a physical and the woman's sorta like that into

1469
01:23:38.650 --> 01:23:40.090
intuitive being.

1470
01:23:40.630 --> 01:23:45.430
Women have to get back to being that intuitive being, because if you notice,

1471
01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:48.910
our women always seem to warn us about stuff, right? Like, Oh, don't do this.

1472
01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.840
I'm like, Damn, I should've listened to at that time. Yeah.

1473
01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:53.950
You know what I'm saying? They have to get back to their spiritual nature.

1474
01:23:53.951 --> 01:23:57.190
And I think a lot of them get away from that and that a ground them to when they

1475
01:23:57.191 --> 01:24:00.740
won't need so much emotional support from friends and family because they're

1476
01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:03.280
back in their spiritual nature. Well, how does a woman do that?

1477
01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.080
You start with meditating, you know, meditating, um, being happy,

1478
01:24:08.081 --> 01:24:10.240
which is being alone with yourself.

1479
01:24:10.930 --> 01:24:13.900
A lot of people can be alone with themselves. Yeah. You know,

1480
01:24:13.930 --> 01:24:16.240
they always need like some sort of device or

1481
01:24:16.700 --> 01:24:20.860
<v 0>interesting that it's attractive when people are capable of being alone. Yeah.</v>

1482
01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:25.190
I remember these two girls were talking about some God that one of them was

1483
01:24:25.191 --> 01:24:29.750
dating and she goes, yeah, he's really into his career, which is a huge turn on.

1484
01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:34.280
I was like, oh, that's interesting. Yeah. He just needs time. He's disciplined.

1485
01:24:34.281 --> 01:24:36.350
He works all the time. He's always working on his career,

1486
01:24:36.351 --> 01:24:41.090
which was a huge turn on and I was like, well, you total cluckers.

1487
01:24:42.070 --> 01:24:43.100
Well, women have to get back

1488
01:24:43.180 --> 01:24:45.270
<v 2>to that too. Like you, I learn how to pick a good man.</v>

1489
01:24:45.570 --> 01:24:49.230
Sometimes y'all are picking crap men based upon the money or things that they

1490
01:24:49.231 --> 01:24:52.080
have. You're getting related to, you finalize $100,000 in debt.

1491
01:24:53.090 --> 01:24:55.220
<v 0>Ah, Douche, right? Yeah. He's got these things.</v>

1492
01:24:55.460 --> 01:24:58.580
I think women have to get better at seeing potential in men,

1493
01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:02.030
but don't they have to be tricked a few times before they can see the problems.

1494
01:25:03.550 --> 01:25:06.590
Problem. Variance. Yeah. That's a fucking dirty thing for a girl.

1495
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:11.360
Let some loser fuck you and go. God Damn it. Yeah. Yeah. I had them,

1496
01:25:11.370 --> 01:25:15.430
I thought I had a winner. Yeah. I mean, I, I've been a victim of debt. I will,

1497
01:25:15.630 --> 01:25:18.890
not in the victim, but you know, I've done that to women myself. Sorry ladies.

1498
01:25:18.891 --> 01:25:23.120
You know, we're all that good day. Yeah. Yeah. I had done some wrong stuff.

1499
01:25:23.150 --> 01:25:26.330
Well, we'd become a different person as time goes on. Yeah. You grow from it.

1500
01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:29.960
Part of evolution of human. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1501
01:25:29.961 --> 01:25:34.020
I think a society's expectations on women are, um,

1502
01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:37.130
it's very difficult for a man to understand it. You know,

1503
01:25:37.170 --> 01:25:40.400
we see it from the outside, but to feel it as a woman,

1504
01:25:40.730 --> 01:25:42.020
it's gotta be very different. I mean,

1505
01:25:42.730 --> 01:25:45.200
there's a lot of women out there that are looking for a man,

1506
01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:47.120
like a successful man.

1507
01:25:47.121 --> 01:25:49.850
They're looking for a successful man and they want to touch themselves.

1508
01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:53.750
And that's like, that's the goal. Yeah, there's not, that's not a goal of men.

1509
01:25:53.751 --> 01:25:57.030
So it's, it's very difficult for us to understand that our goal for PR,

1510
01:25:57.160 --> 01:25:58.520
you know, obviously we're generalizing, right?

1511
01:25:58.790 --> 01:26:00.890
But our goal is to be successful ourselves,

1512
01:26:00.940 --> 01:26:02.050
<v 2>right? Well, you can't,</v>

1513
01:26:02.410 --> 01:26:06.740
you can't know what man you want unless you know who you are.

1514
01:26:07.730 --> 01:26:11.540
And a lot of people are getting relationships without being in relationship with

1515
01:26:11.541 --> 01:26:15.650
themselves first. So when, um, you know,

1516
01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:17.480
in order to

1517
01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:18.953
<v 5>okay,</v>

1518
01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:23.870
<v 2>have a sound relationship, you have to know your socioeconomic stance.</v>

1519
01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:25.653
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1520
01:26:25.730 --> 01:26:28.550
<v 2>Is Sad when you get into a relationship with a conservative and you're liberal.</v>

1521
01:26:28.551 --> 01:26:28.741
And He,

1522
01:26:28.741 --> 01:26:33.710
I start arguing about Donald Trump in a relationship breaks because he's on one

1523
01:26:33.711 --> 01:26:36.530
side. These are the conversations that you need to have upfront.

1524
01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:39.980
And if you don't know where you are politically and socioeconomically,

1525
01:26:39.981 --> 01:26:43.580
for example, they say a lot of relationships break up because of money, right?

1526
01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:47.510
I, you got one person's a bad spender. The other one's thrifty, right?

1527
01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:50.090
These are the conversations you need to have first.

1528
01:26:50.150 --> 01:26:53.600
How do you manage your money? No. Are you good with your money? You know,

1529
01:26:53.780 --> 01:26:57.470
and if you guys don't agree with how you want to pull your resource and how you

1530
01:26:57.471 --> 01:27:00.440
want to pull your money and what you want to do with it in a future, you know,

1531
01:27:00.441 --> 01:27:01.274
some people,

1532
01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:02.780
you know you might get in a relationship with a girl and she's like,

1533
01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:05.930
I want to push, you know, I want to Land Rover and I'm like,

1534
01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:10.880
I want a business. I want a VC. You know what I mean?

1535
01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:13.670
So you have two people that are go in separate directions.

1536
01:27:13.671 --> 01:27:16.850
One going as consumer route one's going into pending, you know, producer route.

1537
01:27:17.270 --> 01:27:20.000
So you have to first see, are you consumer? Maybe you need to be a con.

1538
01:27:20.230 --> 01:27:22.900
What a consumer are you a producer? You don't need to be what to consume,

1539
01:27:23.110 --> 01:27:25.850
what you need to find some minus producer. So if you,

1540
01:27:25.851 --> 01:27:29.270
if you agree on socioeconomics, you'll have a better relationship with people,

1541
01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:33.230
but you have to know what you want out of life first and then find people

1542
01:27:33.231 --> 01:27:36.080
connected based upon that, not the physical looks and all that other stuff.

1543
01:27:36.340 --> 01:27:36.360
Yeah.

1544
01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:40.130
I think sometimes people think they want something because it's very difficult

1545
01:27:40.131 --> 01:27:44.300
to attain. They see these things and they go, oh, that's the, that's the prize.

1546
01:27:44.540 --> 01:27:48.560
Yeah. Well, you know, the thing is he stuff aren't hard to obtain. Like,

1547
01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:52.430
you know, getting a Porsche isn't hard. Right? It's hard for a lot of people.

1548
01:27:52.770 --> 01:27:55.730
Depends on how much money, what you do, what kind of job you're trapped in.

1549
01:27:56.390 --> 01:28:01.220
Heart is relative. Right. You know, like, like I tell my kids, heart is,

1550
01:28:01.670 --> 01:28:06.020
uh, basically undiscovered. That's all it is. Right? So for example,

1551
01:28:06.021 --> 01:28:10.760
when you first do Algebra, it's hard, right? But that's just because it's new.

1552
01:28:10.790 --> 01:28:15.470
So hard equals new. MMM. That's what hard means.

1553
01:28:15.620 --> 01:28:18.710
It's new because once you do Algebra three, four, five,

1554
01:28:18.711 --> 01:28:22.340
10 times is not new anymore. And therefore it's not hard.

1555
01:28:23.050 --> 01:28:26.750
So once you break past the, the newness of a thing,

1556
01:28:26.990 --> 01:28:31.610
it's no longer hard. Like building a business. It's not new to me.

1557
01:28:31.611 --> 01:28:36.580
Therefore it's not hard. It's very easy for me to build a business.

1558
01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:41.110
Yeah. Because I've done it so many times in my life is what I'm saying.

1559
01:28:42.370 --> 01:28:42.400
[inaudible]

1560
01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:47.400
is cash flowing four x what it was doing when I first joined the company.

1561
01:28:49.270 --> 01:28:50.680
And all I do is make a few tweaks,

1562
01:28:50.830 --> 01:28:54.100
but that's only because I'm not new to the tech startup space.

1563
01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:59.030
I've been working with over 20 startups, over 20 startups in the, in, in,

1564
01:28:59.031 --> 01:29:03.570
in a matter of two, three years as a, so this stuff, when people say, oh,

1565
01:29:03.571 --> 01:29:04.880
it's hard, it's like, no, no, not hard.

1566
01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:08.310
[inaudible] it's new and you're an idiot and you don't know what you're doing.

1567
01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:12.540
It's not hard to achieve anything in his life. My, uh, you know,

1568
01:29:12.541 --> 01:29:16.290
I used to work for 50 same, right? And, uh, uh, I, uh,

1569
01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:21.240
when I lived in New Brunswick, right by Rutgers, I wasn't really a 50 cent fan.

1570
01:29:21.241 --> 01:29:23.700
I enjoyed his music, but I wasn't a fan to buy a poster.

1571
01:29:23.701 --> 01:29:28.220
I bought this poster was him and g unit and he had this big stash of money and I

1572
01:29:28.230 --> 01:29:30.960
was like, Yo, this just, this poster motivates me.

1573
01:29:31.230 --> 01:29:35.760
You fast forward 10 years and some other things I did to get close to 50 and I

1574
01:29:35.761 --> 01:29:39.840
actually work with 50. That was technically hard, right?

1575
01:29:39.841 --> 01:29:44.160
It's not easy to get nick to 50 but when I did it, it happened like that.

1576
01:29:44.161 --> 01:29:46.050
Then I started working with Carmelo Anthony.

1577
01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:47.760
So you're saying once it actually happened,

1578
01:29:47.761 --> 01:29:52.650
it turned out it wasn't actually hard. No. Harder to some people, no,

1579
01:29:52.651 --> 01:29:53.730
they're just not disciplined.

1580
01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:57.870
The hard hard is dealing with yourself.

1581
01:29:58.740 --> 01:30:02.580
That's what's hard. Can you defeat your own mind?

1582
01:30:02.910 --> 01:30:06.540
So when I wake up every morning, the only thing I got to defeat is doubt.

1583
01:30:07.210 --> 01:30:10.350
It's the only thing I have to defeat. Once I defeat doubt,

1584
01:30:11.550 --> 01:30:15.330
I live in a a limitless world. Infinite possibilities.

1585
01:30:15.390 --> 01:30:18.960
I can literally do anything you sold. So people told me, Oh,

1586
01:30:18.961 --> 01:30:22.770
in order to be in tech, you know you need $1 million and and this, that,

1587
01:30:22.771 --> 01:30:26.340
and the third dude, I got equity in three tech companies,

1588
01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:30.390
three tech companies, and I'm not rich. I didn't, you know,

1589
01:30:30.391 --> 01:30:32.340
put up millions to get into these companies.

1590
01:30:32.700 --> 01:30:37.350
I'm part of these companies because I built me and it wasn't hard.

1591
01:30:37.590 --> 01:30:39.570
It really wasn't hard to get into these companies.

1592
01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:42.510
I just had something to offer and they saw value in me.

1593
01:30:43.110 --> 01:30:47.520
I want to be the next Elon Musk. I want to be the next Bill Gates.

1594
01:30:47.550 --> 01:30:51.450
I want to be the guy that Zuckerberg hates. You see what I'm saying?

1595
01:30:51.660 --> 01:30:56.660
I want to be the guy that that builds the new silicon valley on the east coast.

1596
01:30:56.850 --> 01:30:59.040
You know that like that's, those are my aspirations.

1597
01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:02.760
So when people tell me what you can and cannot do and it is hard, I'm like,

1598
01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:04.830
dude, I'm selling bitcoin.

1599
01:31:05.340 --> 01:31:08.730
How many black dudes do you know sell bitcoin?

1600
01:31:09.990 --> 01:31:13.530
None. I don't know anybody who sells bitcoin. Exactly.

1601
01:31:13.980 --> 01:31:16.370
And people are telling me, this is hard. It's not hard. You, you,

1602
01:31:16.371 --> 01:31:21.030
you get what you want. And I didn't get into bitcoin out of dumb luck.

1603
01:31:21.060 --> 01:31:25.320
I manifested that. I said I wanted to sell bitcoin. How can I manifest it?

1604
01:31:25.420 --> 01:31:28.470
Then I let it go and the universe brought me an opportunity and then it happened

1605
01:31:29.050 --> 01:31:32.460
when I said, when I first said I want to be a VC.

1606
01:31:32.850 --> 01:31:35.220
First thing I want to do is start building a portfolio.

1607
01:31:36.810 --> 01:31:40.710
I didn't look for companies. They found me. It just,

1608
01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:44.160
I just had to ask the universe and it presented opportunities.

1609
01:31:44.161 --> 01:31:46.860
And not just had to because what do you mean by how to ask the universe?

1610
01:31:47.370 --> 01:31:48.720
I had to put the intention out there.

1611
01:31:48.930 --> 01:31:51.900
So do you think that literally by thinking about things you can make them

1612
01:31:51.901 --> 01:31:52.734
happen.

1613
01:31:52.770 --> 01:31:57.720
You can make the opportunity present itself and then you have to be ready to

1614
01:31:57.721 --> 01:32:00.670
take advantage. So let's, we've got to walk through the story to 50 cent thing,

1615
01:32:00.671 --> 01:32:04.240
right? So I get invited to his bus launch, right? For the company.

1616
01:32:04.450 --> 01:32:05.680
Now I'm sitting on the bus,

1617
01:32:05.710 --> 01:32:08.320
they move me to the back because of security reasons.

1618
01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:13.090
So I'm going to back at a bus. When a bus started moving in, my head,

1619
01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:16.450
fear kicks in and doubt kicks in and I'm telling myself I should just hop,

1620
01:32:16.590 --> 01:32:19.570
we with the bus stop. And I said, I should just hop up and just start screaming.

1621
01:32:19.571 --> 01:32:22.590
I'm on a bus or 50 cents and I'm like, Nah, I don't do ag Dane.

1622
01:32:22.591 --> 01:32:25.390
And why did you wire? You've got to sit here and that's not right.

1623
01:32:25.391 --> 01:32:29.500
And you know all these things society says is right. So I stand up and I go,

1624
01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:34.510
Yo want a bus with 50 cent. Right. And in the whole crowd rushes the bus.

1625
01:32:34.870 --> 01:32:38.530
After the crowd finishes, they take one of the a energy drink shirts.

1626
01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:41.530
They throw it on me, throw the hat on me. They bring me to the front of the bus.

1627
01:32:41.650 --> 01:32:44.440
Now I'm sitting next to 50 cent. Fast forward two years later,

1628
01:32:44.441 --> 01:32:45.460
I'm in a 50 st company,

1629
01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:49.900
but it's because I started off with defeat and doubt,

1630
01:32:51.130 --> 01:32:55.750
but also listening to my intuition. My intuition said to hop up and do that.

1631
01:32:56.560 --> 01:33:01.360
Right. But the opportunity was presented to me. I didn't,

1632
01:33:01.450 --> 01:33:06.130
I didn't create the opportunity. They DM me and said, Yo, we want you to come.

1633
01:33:07.210 --> 01:33:09.010
I didn't ask. They invited me,

1634
01:33:09.790 --> 01:33:13.750
but it's because I kept putting that 50 cent energy out there. Hmm.

1635
01:33:13.990 --> 01:33:16.930
He assumes I kept putting that out there. Like, y'all won't mess with 50 cent.

1636
01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:18.640
I won't miss it for 10 years.

1637
01:33:18.670 --> 01:33:22.160
I've been putting information that energy out there, 50 of you listening, Johan,

1638
01:33:22.380 --> 01:33:23.410
let me, I want to work with you again.

1639
01:33:24.140 --> 01:33:27.260
<v 0>Um, but I really, I just really love 15 his attitude.</v>

1640
01:33:27.270 --> 01:33:28.210
He's just really a fun dude.

1641
01:33:28.260 --> 01:33:30.420
Do you know what a funny thing about father's Day is?

1642
01:33:30.421 --> 01:33:34.720
He's roundabout father's Day, Father's day and mother's Day. Very funny.

1643
01:33:36.850 --> 01:33:41.830
<v 2>You know the universe. Anything you ask for it,</v>

1644
01:33:42.010 --> 01:33:45.400
we'll present the opportunity. The only thing is, are you woken up to see it?

1645
01:33:46.810 --> 01:33:51.610
Can you identify when it hits and, and, and can you defeat the fear to,

1646
01:33:51.810 --> 01:33:52.720
to, to, to,

1647
01:33:52.970 --> 01:33:55.560
<v 0>and do you have all the other bases in your life covered where you have the</v>

1648
01:33:55.561 --> 01:33:58.530
bandwidth to tackle some correct. Difficult, correct. Correct.

1649
01:33:58.560 --> 01:33:59.460
But usually the unit

1650
01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:02.310
<v 2>verse only presents you opportunities you can handle. They don't yet.</v>

1651
01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:04.680
Usually it doesn't. Cause if you couldn't handle it,

1652
01:34:04.681 --> 01:34:07.720
you wouldn't be able to recognize it. Do you say this like, like

1653
01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:11.360
<v 0>the universe presents this to you. This is like a spiritual concept.</v>

1654
01:34:11.670 --> 01:34:16.460
Is this like, are you manifesting reality with your thoughts and intentions?

1655
01:34:16.461 --> 01:34:18.950
Do you really believe that? All of that. Why do you believe that?

1656
01:34:19.370 --> 01:34:21.290
Because I lived it. I experienced it,

1657
01:34:21.291 --> 01:34:23.560
but you lived it and you're successful at it. See that's my,

1658
01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:27.660
my perspective on that is always you hear about things like the secret in the

1659
01:34:27.661 --> 01:34:30.170
law of attraction. You hear that from people that are successful. They say,

1660
01:34:30.171 --> 01:34:31.890
well I willed it into existence. Yeah,

1661
01:34:32.060 --> 01:34:34.910
but what about the people that tried to will it into existence and nothing ever

1662
01:34:34.911 --> 01:34:39.470
worked out right. Or at [inaudible] right. Or at Laboy Latin for work and pray.

1663
01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:42.950
A lot of people go into the secret and they just praying but they ain't working

1664
01:34:43.070 --> 01:34:47.180
right. That's important. You know? So I do see what you're saying.

1665
01:34:47.181 --> 01:34:52.070
I don't look at it in the same way, but I look at it in a similar way.

1666
01:34:52.490 --> 01:34:55.160
I think there is something to intention.

1667
01:34:55.190 --> 01:34:58.370
There's something and there's also to having

1668
01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:01.930
<v 1>that kind of faith to believe in intention. Whereas I think a lot of people do,</v>

1669
01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:06.050
they're reluctant to give into that because it seems too woo woo and it seems

1670
01:35:06.051 --> 01:35:10.250
like some crystals and fucking astrology and horse shit. You know what I mean?

1671
01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:11.930
Cause there's a lot of that out there. A lot of them,

1672
01:35:12.350 --> 01:35:16.340
the new age has ruined the law of attraction. You know what I mean? It's like,

1673
01:35:16.370 --> 01:35:19.070
oh, just speaking into the system and happened. Now that's not true.

1674
01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:23.630
You have to first educate yourself. So when we talk about Hotep, right?

1675
01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.180
When you talk about Hotep, you got to bring up the 5% nation.

1676
01:35:26.290 --> 01:35:30.650
You've got to bring up supreme mathematics, zero cipher one, knowledge, two,

1677
01:35:30.651 --> 01:35:34.160
wisdom, three understanding. But it first starts it, the number one, right?

1678
01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:37.760
Number one is knowledge. So the problem is people that try to manifest,

1679
01:35:37.761 --> 01:35:39.750
but he ain't got no knowledge of anything, right?

1680
01:35:40.490 --> 01:35:43.850
So how do you manifest something with no knowledge? You got to educate yourself.

1681
01:35:43.851 --> 01:35:46.520
You've got to first start educating yourself on disability yourself so that you

1682
01:35:46.521 --> 01:35:47.720
can educate yourself as well,

1683
01:35:47.820 --> 01:35:51.660
<v 2>right? And also knowledge is the springboard for imagination,</v>

1684
01:35:52.830 --> 01:35:56.130
right? So if there's a complicated calculus problem,

1685
01:35:56.670 --> 01:35:58.230
what you don't know what calculus is,

1686
01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:03.320
how can intuition feeds you a insight or inspiration to solve a cargos problem?

1687
01:36:04.891 --> 01:36:08.370
You first have to have the knowledge of Calculus. Then when you get it,

1688
01:36:08.371 --> 01:36:12.030
you get all this influx of inspiration, like onstart talks about, you know,

1689
01:36:12.031 --> 01:36:14.610
he sits down, he kind of Meditates, and then the inspiration comes.

1690
01:36:14.820 --> 01:36:19.530
But the inspiration can only talk to you based upon your understanding

1691
01:36:21.250 --> 01:36:22.200
because he was saying yes.

1692
01:36:22.230 --> 01:36:26.960
So the problem is people out here not educating themselves. You know, I,

1693
01:36:27.090 --> 01:36:27.721
I, I,

1694
01:36:27.721 --> 01:36:32.721
my day begins and ends with educating myself and begins ends and during the day

1695
01:36:33.511 --> 01:36:34.560
I'm just reading books,

1696
01:36:34.561 --> 01:36:38.610
hopping between books and reading and listening to lectures and people think I'm

1697
01:36:38.611 --> 01:36:41.750
deep and I'm like, I don't know. I don't know, whatever, whatever. One,

1698
01:36:41.850 --> 01:36:42.241
I'm intelligent,

1699
01:36:42.241 --> 01:36:46.530
but really my secret is consuming as much information as possible.

1700
01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:51.100
That's my secret. And in from that I'm able to say, oh well, you know, Duh,

1701
01:36:51.450 --> 01:36:54.660
you know, studying history, you know, you can, you can do a lot of things,

1702
01:36:54.990 --> 01:36:59.990
but if you're not educating yourself or doing,

1703
01:37:01.390 --> 01:37:03.810
you got to do something like just start, you know what I mean?

1704
01:37:04.260 --> 01:37:05.700
<v 1>When you say you're going to write a new book,</v>

1705
01:37:05.990 --> 01:37:06.840
you're in the middle of writing a book.

1706
01:37:06.870 --> 01:37:09.150
Are you putting this kind of stuff in your book? All right,

1707
01:37:09.151 --> 01:37:11.370
so the next guidelines like that, I'm sorry to interrupt you,

1708
01:37:11.460 --> 01:37:14.580
but guidelines like that is the thing that's very critical.

1709
01:37:14.610 --> 01:37:17.670
When someone sees someone who's successful and see someone and they see someone

1710
01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:19.680
who's disciplined and focused like, okay, what are you,

1711
01:37:19.740 --> 01:37:21.630
what are your guidelines? How do you do this? And how,

1712
01:37:21.631 --> 01:37:26.040
like the way you're laying it out, like right now. So, so this book here, right?

1713
01:37:26.310 --> 01:37:27.210
This Twitter marketing,

1714
01:37:27.380 --> 01:37:31.190
<v 2>yeah, this book is the how, how do you do it, right?</v>

1715
01:37:31.250 --> 01:37:36.020
Like how do you physically build a brand from start using Twitter as a platform?

1716
01:37:36.021 --> 01:37:38.090
That is, a book can actually be used for any platform.

1717
01:37:38.270 --> 01:37:40.190
I just use Twitter as the example, right?

1718
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:42.990
But this is the how that people won't tell you about. Well,

1719
01:37:42.991 --> 01:37:45.230
markers won't tell you about this is the how, right?

1720
01:37:45.260 --> 01:37:49.760
It's all the Caesar's in here. Now the next book I have is with the editor.

1721
01:37:49.761 --> 01:37:52.010
It's done. It's written. That's for men.

1722
01:37:52.011 --> 01:37:55.350
And how to have peaceful relationships with women. Right?

1723
01:37:55.650 --> 01:37:59.160
Cause as we see it as a gender worn in America. So we need to create peace.

1724
01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:02.280
And what I say is default isn't on the women. The fold is on the men, right?

1725
01:38:02.610 --> 01:38:06.750
So that book was, uh, uh, the cover was designed by rural Tomasi.

1726
01:38:06.870 --> 01:38:08.040
The rational male author.

1727
01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:11.640
Then we have the book of Hotep was what you're talking about,

1728
01:38:11.700 --> 01:38:15.720
which is already written. I wrote it two, three years ago. And it's that, that,

1729
01:38:16.260 --> 01:38:17.093
uh,

1730
01:38:17.190 --> 01:38:22.080
structure for your life so you can manifest these things, you know,

1731
01:38:22.081 --> 01:38:25.350
so you can use spirit in your work to manifest. He stinks.

1732
01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:30.060
If you're a Christian, there's secrets in the Bible that show you how to,

1733
01:38:30.210 --> 01:38:34.620
you know, manifest things. So you have to,

1734
01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:39.960
you, you can't ignore your spiritual self. If you ever watched Dr Strange,

1735
01:38:40.260 --> 01:38:42.930
she pushes him out and his astral body comes down.

1736
01:38:43.260 --> 01:38:46.590
So the human being is his dual nature. We have our physical Biden,

1737
01:38:46.591 --> 01:38:49.920
we have our astral body. Have you never connect with, to astral body,

1738
01:38:49.921 --> 01:38:53.580
you only use half of your potential. What's your Astrobotic a it's,

1739
01:38:53.610 --> 01:38:55.230
it's basically a,

1740
01:38:56.760 --> 01:39:00.120
any theory you will version of

1741
01:39:01.620 --> 01:39:03.420
your, uh, physical body,

1742
01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:08.010
but it's not bound by time and space. So what do you mean by that though?

1743
01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:09.740
What does that mean? What do you mean? What does that mean?

1744
01:39:09.810 --> 01:39:12.540
The real version of your spiritual body? Like it's not physical.

1745
01:39:12.541 --> 01:39:15.480
You can't touch it. Okay. Right. You can't like interact with it, right?

1746
01:39:15.870 --> 01:39:19.050
But it can travel through space and time, right?

1747
01:39:21.150 --> 01:39:22.770
All we talk about our higher selves,

1748
01:39:23.670 --> 01:39:26.010
all we can to make things more understandable.

1749
01:39:26.220 --> 01:39:29.280
Cause all this stuff is based upon a subconscious mind, right?

1750
01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:32.550
So you use the subconscious mind to program.

1751
01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:35.460
I mean you use your conscious mind to program your subconscious mind.

1752
01:39:35.670 --> 01:39:39.030
The subconscious mind communicates it to your higher mind than a higher mind.

1753
01:39:39.420 --> 01:39:41.700
That's where the magic stuff happens, is out of your control.

1754
01:39:41.701 --> 01:39:45.540
Now the higher mind or spirit or God or Jesus, whatever you want to believe in,

1755
01:39:45.780 --> 01:39:50.070
that's when they start working on this stuff. But it has to be a part of you.

1756
01:39:50.220 --> 01:39:53.700
And then life starts reflecting what's in your subconscious mind.

1757
01:39:54.060 --> 01:39:58.200
But did the Astrobotic thing, I is kind of like a,

1758
01:39:58.260 --> 01:40:03.260
something that we use to either communicate with people in long distance,

1759
01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:09.060
traveled through time to see things that have happened and foreign lanes at

1760
01:40:09.061 --> 01:40:11.760
different times. Uh, get inspiration.

1761
01:40:11.790 --> 01:40:14.490
So when we look at thinking grow rich, right?

1762
01:40:15.450 --> 01:40:17.070
The book thinking grow rich was to tell you to do.

1763
01:40:17.071 --> 01:40:19.020
It tells you create a council of,

1764
01:40:19.170 --> 01:40:20.970
I think he says dead people or something like that. Right?

1765
01:40:21.340 --> 01:40:23.760
He said create a council of debt, people your counsel. Right?

1766
01:40:23.790 --> 01:40:28.170
So if I did mine and probably be like Malcolm x to pop Nipsey Hussle,

1767
01:40:28.470 --> 01:40:29.910
you know like oh a bunch of people, right?

1768
01:40:30.510 --> 01:40:33.810
And you have this congregation meeting of minds,

1769
01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:35.940
you can't do that with your physical body.

1770
01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:37.740
So who's going to be present at this meeting?

1771
01:40:38.070 --> 01:40:40.190
The astral body has to be president as mean.

1772
01:40:40.770 --> 01:40:45.770
So that's an example of how we've seen that science taught in thinking grow

1773
01:40:46.561 --> 01:40:49.200
rich. Right? So we can't stay. This stuff is like,

1774
01:40:49.570 --> 01:40:53.130
aren't you saying when you're talking about like a council of dead people,

1775
01:40:53.290 --> 01:40:55.250
you're saying like your imagination, your,

1776
01:40:55.260 --> 01:40:59.890
you're looking at this council of dead people. Like what would Tupac do?

1777
01:41:00.150 --> 01:41:04.510
Like Damn Shit. What, how would I draw inspiration from Ali? How would I,

1778
01:41:04.870 --> 01:41:08.590
how would I take the, the, the, the knowledge of, you know,

1779
01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:12.760
fill in the blank. Whoever's dead. Yeah. Brilliant. Yeah.

1780
01:41:13.030 --> 01:41:17.170
So there is that aspect, right? Where it's your imagination, right?

1781
01:41:17.260 --> 01:41:21.790
What would Jesus do? Right? Well that is, that's the thing, right? So,

1782
01:41:22.010 --> 01:41:26.350
but what we have to understand is there's going to be a sliver of inspirational

1783
01:41:26.351 --> 01:41:30.700
insight. So let's say 90% of your meeting with these people are pure physical,

1784
01:41:31.060 --> 01:41:34.870
your mind imagining these things, then there's that one sliver,

1785
01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:37.960
that one 10% that slides through that gives you that piece of inspiration that

1786
01:41:37.961 --> 01:41:40.450
you never would have thought about. It's like an idea that, you know,

1787
01:41:40.451 --> 01:41:42.970
sometimes you're telling me like, oh, oh yeah, you know,

1788
01:41:42.971 --> 01:41:46.270
that idea that just pops in your head. That is what happens.

1789
01:41:46.271 --> 01:41:47.740
Now once you get more advanced,

1790
01:41:47.741 --> 01:41:51.060
you can get more of that influx of inspiration from, you know,

1791
01:41:51.130 --> 01:41:53.650
Spirit or whatever you want to call it, get more advanced,

1792
01:41:53.651 --> 01:41:58.330
meaning practice this all the time. Yeah. Yeah. Practicing,

1793
01:41:59.140 --> 01:41:59.973
um, you know,

1794
01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:04.450
using your astral body to project out and being in another space, uh,

1795
01:42:04.451 --> 01:42:08.650
happy Gilmore cause of this happy space. You remember that movie? Yeah.

1796
01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:11.590
All right. So what did he do in order to manifest his dreams?

1797
01:42:11.591 --> 01:42:16.591
He went to his happy place to detach himself from his physical problems.

1798
01:42:19.130 --> 01:42:22.600
Hmm. I'm saying okay. And then he came back and he put, and it went to dirt,

1799
01:42:22.601 --> 01:42:24.940
dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt. There was like, he did the impossible.

1800
01:42:24.941 --> 01:42:26.080
So it's like they try and let you know.

1801
01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:30.700
So if you were to construct this and put this down in the guidelines,

1802
01:42:31.030 --> 01:42:31.600
you,

1803
01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:36.600
you're basically streamlining the process of how to be as successful and uh,

1804
01:42:37.540 --> 01:42:42.400
how to, how to just, yeah. Make your dream come true.

1805
01:42:42.401 --> 01:42:47.260
Make, make your reality how to be a person who's got their shit together.

1806
01:42:47.350 --> 01:42:50.530
Yeah. I, you know, the main thing is problem when people,

1807
01:42:50.531 --> 01:42:52.180
especially young people, is they don't know what they want to do.

1808
01:42:52.630 --> 01:42:55.000
They didn't know that passion or purpose. And again,

1809
01:42:55.001 --> 01:42:56.620
that just comes back to knowledge. Are you studying?

1810
01:42:57.910 --> 01:43:01.360
Take your interest and study it. When you get bored with it, drop it,

1811
01:43:01.390 --> 01:43:04.450
move on to the next thing. But you know,

1812
01:43:04.451 --> 01:43:08.050
like over the years I've collected a lot of skills,

1813
01:43:08.860 --> 01:43:12.130
all of them being used. Now, you know, like I'm not a Photoshop guy,

1814
01:43:12.160 --> 01:43:13.480
but I know how to use Photoshop.

1815
01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:17.410
But that happened because at one point I was running a blog.

1816
01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:21.460
I had to know how to edit something or do something, you know what I mean?

1817
01:43:21.940 --> 01:43:24.430
So just because it's not a skill you want.

1818
01:43:24.431 --> 01:43:27.130
Like at one point I had photography business when my space was popping out of

1819
01:43:27.131 --> 01:43:31.390
photography business. Now I don't do photography anymore,

1820
01:43:31.391 --> 01:43:35.680
but I understand it. So when I'm some place, I can still use these skills,

1821
01:43:35.681 --> 01:43:37.990
whether it's for a product or something or event,

1822
01:43:38.140 --> 01:43:40.690
I can still use these skills to my advantage. You know what I mean?

1823
01:43:41.020 --> 01:43:44.020
So even if you don't like that skill at that time,

1824
01:43:44.290 --> 01:43:46.270
it might come into play later. Right.

1825
01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:50.830
But the bottom line is you have to start with your knowledge and then,

1826
01:43:50.860 --> 01:43:55.860
and then allow the spirit or intuition to us to feed it

1827
01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:02.000
right loud to feed it. Like I don't use my logical mind.

1828
01:44:02.260 --> 01:44:06.050
Like my logical mind is, is only for after inspiration.

1829
01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:09.230
Right? You get that.

1830
01:44:09.460 --> 01:44:09.880
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1831
01:44:09.880 --> 01:44:13.240
So you get inspired and then you use your logical mind to figure out how to make

1832
01:44:13.241 --> 01:44:13.990
this work.

1833
01:44:13.990 --> 01:44:18.580
<v 2>Right. And that's where we have to be. Let the,</v>

1834
01:44:18.581 --> 01:44:21.580
let the logical mind just carry out the menial tasks.

1835
01:44:21.850 --> 01:44:24.580
Let the higher man into wish and lead the way.

1836
01:44:26.010 --> 01:44:26.370
<v 3>Now,</v>

1837
01:44:26.370 --> 01:44:30.590
do you think of these things as being like separate entities or is this all all

1838
01:44:30.660 --> 01:44:33.420
part of you? That's all one. So you think when you think of your,

1839
01:44:33.510 --> 01:44:36.990
your higher mind, how do you visualize this? Do you do,

1840
01:44:37.310 --> 01:44:40.350
do you visualize this as something that you don't necessarily have control of

1841
01:44:40.351 --> 01:44:41.550
but you can tap into?

1842
01:44:42.210 --> 01:44:45.510
<v 2>Yeah, I guess you could look at it like that. Like, you know,</v>

1843
01:44:45.511 --> 01:44:47.850
I'm not the Dalai Lama on this topic. You know what I mean?

1844
01:44:48.150 --> 01:44:52.860
But you know I A to for one exercise,

1845
01:44:52.861 --> 01:44:57.030
what I might do is I love, I put light around my head.

1846
01:44:58.020 --> 01:45:00.240
I'll visualize a sphere of light around my head.

1847
01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:03.360
And you see this in religious texts. In Art,

1848
01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:05.310
you always see Jesus Christ or saints,

1849
01:45:05.311 --> 01:45:08.760
they always have this glow around their head. They call it a halo, right?

1850
01:45:09.750 --> 01:45:12.780
But really the halo is like your aura, right?

1851
01:45:13.230 --> 01:45:18.230
But also the second aspect is that when I want to use my brain in an events way,

1852
01:45:19.950 --> 01:45:24.950
I can start the firing of neutrons or whatever the technical term is by

1853
01:45:25.021 --> 01:45:29.010
visualizing something. Even if I want to visualize, you know,

1854
01:45:29.011 --> 01:45:33.420
thunderstorms in my head, you know, that'll get the brain working, you know?

1855
01:45:33.450 --> 01:45:36.630
But usually like light, if I want to do distant healing, right?

1856
01:45:36.660 --> 01:45:39.720
Let's say you tell me you sick, right? I probably shouldn't be saying this, but,

1857
01:45:40.140 --> 01:45:44.640
um, if I want to do this in healing, I would envelop you in light.

1858
01:45:46.350 --> 01:45:50.040
I would sit at home rest, make sure you sleep.

1859
01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:52.990
Then I would picture light around your work.

1860
01:45:53.490 --> 01:45:54.960
<v 3>Do you think that you can do that?</v>

1861
01:45:55.010 --> 01:45:57.180
Do you think you can actually heal people from a distance?

1862
01:45:58.150 --> 01:46:01.000
<v 2>No. You're not healing anything.</v>

1863
01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:05.230
What you're doing is you're giving the intention to God that you want this

1864
01:46:05.231 --> 01:46:07.990
person to be healed in God or the universe is healing.

1865
01:46:08.740 --> 01:46:10.030
We can't heal a damn thing.

1866
01:46:10.130 --> 01:46:12.950
<v 3>Right? But you really think that by thinking about something,</v>

1867
01:46:12.951 --> 01:46:16.040
you can put that intention now, the little change the result.

1868
01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:19.540
<v 2>Yes. Really. What makes you think that? Uh,</v>

1869
01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:23.190
well they have these scientific tests. Ah, I haven't studied this in a while,

1870
01:46:23.191 --> 01:46:26.820
but there's a test where they fire like these electrons or something like that

1871
01:46:27.210 --> 01:46:30.180
and the electrons are supposed to be like on a predictable path.

1872
01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:32.370
And then when they introduce people to the experiment,

1873
01:46:32.570 --> 01:46:35.300
<v 3>the intensity, you don't take the wave spirit. You know,</v>

1874
01:46:35.301 --> 01:46:38.870
the problem with that is that's misinterpreted. Okay. The, the,

1875
01:46:38.930 --> 01:46:42.260
the real change is in observing it. Yes.

1876
01:46:42.261 --> 01:46:44.300
But the change is in observing it because you're measuring it.

1877
01:46:44.660 --> 01:46:46.970
So by measuring it, you changing the pattern.

1878
01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:48.950
Like if you talked to a real physicist about it,

1879
01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:52.290
they'll say they've added all this woo woo to this. That's unnecessary.

1880
01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:54.450
Because really what it is is just the tools,

1881
01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:57.420
the instrument to use them to measure it or change their results.

1882
01:46:57.540 --> 01:46:59.160
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah. I could definitely see that.</v>

1883
01:46:59.340 --> 01:47:03.630
The thing is that physics has to marry spirituality and spirituality has to,

1884
01:47:03.890 --> 01:47:07.620
Matt has to marry a physics. If you don't have that connection between the two,

1885
01:47:07.621 --> 01:47:08.700
we don't got the whole picture.

1886
01:47:09.310 --> 01:47:12.530
<v 3>MMM. Spirituality is a weird word. What does that mean?</v>

1887
01:47:12.910 --> 01:47:16.390
<v 2>It's a, a very taboo word is a very abused word.</v>

1888
01:47:16.530 --> 01:47:20.580
<v 3>It's abused for sure. It's, I'm not religious, but I'm spiritual.</v>

1889
01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:23.430
I'm like that kind of shit. Yeah. That's where it gets weird.

1890
01:47:23.620 --> 01:47:27.520
<v 2>Yeah. I don't like that at all. You know, when I speak about spirituality,</v>

1891
01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:30.070
I'm speaking about something that really can't be put into words.

1892
01:47:30.071 --> 01:47:31.510
It's unfathomable. You know,

1893
01:47:31.570 --> 01:47:35.470
our language isn't designed to talk about this stuff. You know,

1894
01:47:35.471 --> 01:47:37.330
when we look at all well and new speak,

1895
01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:42.790
there's certain words that don't exist for this stuff.

1896
01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:46.090
You'd have to use a, an ancient language and even ancient language,

1897
01:47:46.091 --> 01:47:48.340
you try to translate it to English. It's like, we don't have a word for this.

1898
01:47:48.341 --> 01:47:49.174
You ever had

1899
01:47:50.210 --> 01:47:53.930
<v 3>like ancient Hebrew when they try to translate things ancient Hebrew,</v>

1900
01:47:54.140 --> 01:47:57.860
all the numbers were actually all the letters rather actually numbers as well,

1901
01:47:57.950 --> 01:47:59.960
correct? Correct. Yeah. Um,

1902
01:48:00.050 --> 01:48:03.980
do you know when you talk about Halos that the original halo was a mushroom cap?

1903
01:48:05.750 --> 01:48:08.630
Yeah, a mushroom cap. Oh, you're talking about, okay.

1904
01:48:08.631 --> 01:48:12.260
I got to the original halo [inaudible] was, well,

1905
01:48:12.261 --> 01:48:14.990
there's a book called the sacred mushroom in the cross.

1906
01:48:14.991 --> 01:48:16.910
It's by John Marco Allegro,

1907
01:48:16.911 --> 01:48:20.900
and he was a biblical scholar that was one of the guys that was assigned to

1908
01:48:20.901 --> 01:48:24.890
decipher the Dead Sea Scrolls, which is the oldest version of the Bible,

1909
01:48:25.670 --> 01:48:28.610
the only one I think that they've ever found. It's written in Aramaic,

1910
01:48:28.611 --> 01:48:33.611
and it was found in Qumran and these clay clay tap these clay jars and it's

1911
01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:38.510
there. It's all made unwritten on animal skins to decipher it.

1912
01:48:38.511 --> 01:48:42.650
They actually had to run DNA tests on the animal skins to figure out which skins

1913
01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:43.820
belonged to which animals.

1914
01:48:43.820 --> 01:48:46.360
So they could put all this stuff together to figure out like, oh, this,

1915
01:48:46.370 --> 01:48:49.730
all these pieces were a part of this one scroll. Yeah. Well this guy,

1916
01:48:49.731 --> 01:48:50.690
John Marco Allegro,

1917
01:48:50.691 --> 01:48:55.691
studied it for 14 years and it was his conclusion after he was done that the

1918
01:48:55.971 --> 01:48:58.970
entire Christian religion was a giant misunderstanding.

1919
01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:02.990
And what it was originally about was the consumption of psychedelic mushrooms

1920
01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:04.400
and fertility rituals.

1921
01:49:05.030 --> 01:49:10.030
And they started doing all of these like these different scholars who studied

1922
01:49:10.161 --> 01:49:13.880
ancient art and ancient religious art. They started finding these,

1923
01:49:13.910 --> 01:49:17.360
this mushroom iconography and all this ancient artwork.

1924
01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:21.580
And one of the things they notice is that the bottom of a mushroom you could

1925
01:49:21.581 --> 01:49:23.900
take like particularly the Amazon and miscarry and mushroom,

1926
01:49:23.901 --> 01:49:27.910
which is the one that they connect to, um, to, uh,

1927
01:49:27.950 --> 01:49:29.090
the Christian religion.

1928
01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:31.340
Look at the bottom of it and see what it looks like with all those lines.

1929
01:49:31.670 --> 01:49:34.940
Now look at that. That was the original halo.

1930
01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:39.050
If you see that picture about with Jesus, with the halo around his head,

1931
01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:42.800
the halo was essentially the bottom of a mushroom cap.

1932
01:49:42.801 --> 01:49:47.800
And the idea they believe was that these people were the ones that were

1933
01:49:47.801 --> 01:49:51.130
consuming the psychedelic mushrooms. So they had this great wisdom and this,

1934
01:49:51.131 --> 01:49:52.480
this connection to God.

1935
01:49:53.230 --> 01:49:57.340
That's what they thought Mana was that as they thought these psychedelic

1936
01:49:57.341 --> 01:50:00.340
mushrooms where the flesh of God, I liked it. Yeah.

1937
01:50:00.341 --> 01:50:05.341
And so that when you have these ancient religions that were possibly based on

1938
01:50:06.611 --> 01:50:09.160
the consumptions of the psychedelic mushrooms,

1939
01:50:09.580 --> 01:50:13.600
all that stuff has kind of been lost in the translation over years and years and

1940
01:50:13.601 --> 01:50:17.080
years. And then even the visualization of the Halos change. Yeah.

1941
01:50:17.350 --> 01:50:22.060
And there's also some really crazy ones of, um, naked people dancing.

1942
01:50:22.210 --> 01:50:26.500
And ecstasy surrounded by this translucent mushroom image.

1943
01:50:26.500 --> 01:50:31.500
So the idea that they were in these mushroom induced euphoric states and that

1944
01:50:31.661 --> 01:50:35.070
they were dancing around these, all these religious depictions. Yeah.

1945
01:50:35.110 --> 01:50:39.190
Very interesting. Because if you think about ancient religions, right? No,

1946
01:50:39.220 --> 01:50:42.640
no science. They had no idea what shaped the world was.

1947
01:50:42.641 --> 01:50:44.620
They didn't know anything. But they did know,

1948
01:50:44.650 --> 01:50:48.170
if you found these mushrooms and you took them, you trip your fucking balls off,

1949
01:50:48.340 --> 01:50:51.460
right. You would have this incredible experience and they thought that was God,

1950
01:50:51.490 --> 01:50:55.070
you know, that there was, that was their connection to God. You know?

1951
01:50:55.090 --> 01:50:57.130
So there's, that's interesting. Yeah,

1952
01:50:57.160 --> 01:51:01.420
it's a great book in the Catholic Church actually bought it out and they, uh,

1953
01:51:01.480 --> 01:51:05.440
they, they got rid of it and then you could only buy used copies of it,

1954
01:51:05.441 --> 01:51:07.440
but then it was republished recently over the last few years.

1955
01:51:07.670 --> 01:51:10.830
<v 1>Someone got the rights to it. [inaudible] yeah. That's interesting.</v>

1956
01:51:10.870 --> 01:51:15.230
Intense stuff. Yeah. I liked that conversation. Yeah, that's sexy.

1957
01:51:16.220 --> 01:51:20.420
You know, anything that goes away from the norm I think is real sexy.

1958
01:51:21.210 --> 01:51:24.640
So needs to and need to be taught. It needs to be talked about. You know,

1959
01:51:24.940 --> 01:51:27.440
you get a sexy woman that accused Trump rape.

1960
01:51:28.260 --> 01:51:32.070
I said that she was talking about rape being sexy. Yes.

1961
01:51:32.870 --> 01:51:36.980
Anderson Cooper's like we'll be right back. Cut to commercial. What?

1962
01:51:37.880 --> 01:51:42.200
Yeah, she's a loony bin. Well, she seems like she might be medicated. Yeah,

1963
01:51:42.201 --> 01:51:44.920
you can definitely tell there's something off there. Yeah, maybe.

1964
01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:48.560
Maybe she's super nervous being on television too. That's also, oh no.

1965
01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:52.310
It's hard to figure out how people are when you see them on television because

1966
01:51:53.810 --> 01:51:58.100
I like to consider myself a good judge of character. She's off her rocker.

1967
01:51:58.580 --> 01:52:01.550
She seems off her rocker. I don't know him personally. I mean,

1968
01:52:01.670 --> 01:52:05.860
some people really do have panic attacks when the camera's on that white light

1969
01:52:06.070 --> 01:52:07.580
during the CNN studios and then

1970
01:52:09.290 --> 01:52:11.180
when it just comes out weird and then they like,

1971
01:52:11.330 --> 01:52:15.560
what the fuck was wrong with me? Right, right. Yeah. Yeah. I could see that.

1972
01:52:15.590 --> 01:52:18.800
I don't think in her case, I think she's just really like,

1973
01:52:20.300 --> 01:52:23.600
do things. Just try to sell a book. Just trying to sell something.

1974
01:52:24.060 --> 01:52:28.530
She definitely wants some attention, you know? But um, Teflon, Donnie,

1975
01:52:28.540 --> 01:52:30.070
she can't do nothing. Teflon on thought.

1976
01:52:32.050 --> 01:52:35.270
It's crazy how he's been able to shake everything off everything.

1977
01:52:35.330 --> 01:52:37.550
If you stay in 10 toes down, he came. I ain't do nothing to you.

1978
01:52:37.580 --> 01:52:38.720
That's why I keep saying like,

1979
01:52:38.721 --> 01:52:42.800
don't worry about these tech companies staying 10 toes down, stand 10 toes down.

1980
01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:46.010
What does that mean? Stand on your, you know, stand on your foot, man.

1981
01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:49.040
Like you know, like stand your ground, you know,

1982
01:52:49.470 --> 01:52:53.710
is it don't waiver just because somebody says something. You know,

1983
01:52:53.900 --> 01:52:58.670
I get criticized a lot online in my responses. I said, what? I said,

1984
01:52:59.930 --> 01:53:00.740
you know, I'll,

1985
01:53:00.740 --> 01:53:04.310
I'll infuriate the left and I infuriate the right and the right to feel like,

1986
01:53:04.311 --> 01:53:06.740
well last week you were approached Trump and now you're saying something that's

1987
01:53:06.741 --> 01:53:08.690
different. It's like, and well,

1988
01:53:08.820 --> 01:53:10.970
you got the most shit I think for that Starbucks video.

1989
01:53:10.971 --> 01:53:14.900
The Starbucks video was hilarious when you walked into Starbucks and he said,

1990
01:53:14.930 --> 01:53:18.110
Oh, who you out? You guys are racist. I'm here to get my free Starbucks.

1991
01:53:18.470 --> 01:53:22.510
And that lady was like, okay, Amanda, shout out to Amanda.

1992
01:53:23.990 --> 01:53:27.440
She's like, yeah, I heard that. Hold on, I'll get you a coffee. It's like,

1993
01:53:27.441 --> 01:53:30.140
I didn't know you could just give away coffee. You work at Starbucks.

1994
01:53:30.141 --> 01:53:33.920
But I guess she just did. I manifested that. Where was that?

1995
01:53:34.280 --> 01:53:38.900
That was a New Jersey Woodbury Commons mall thing. That's hilarious.

1996
01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:39.830
Yeah. But you know,

1997
01:53:39.831 --> 01:53:44.690
like I manifested it and you can go look at the tweet two weeks before said,

1998
01:53:44.780 --> 01:53:49.580
I said, uh, if you want to be on mainstream media, pretend to be liberal.

1999
01:53:49.880 --> 01:53:54.200
Then I also said, I said to my followers, I said, can y'all get me on Fox News?

2000
01:53:54.440 --> 01:53:57.590
The next week I pulled this stunt and then got on Fox News.

2001
01:53:59.150 --> 01:54:01.190
Now when they had you on Fox News, what was the premise?

2002
01:54:01.191 --> 01:54:04.100
What were they going to talk? What'd they say? Hey, I just want the story.

2003
01:54:04.490 --> 01:54:06.640
They just want some, hey,

2004
01:54:06.650 --> 01:54:10.640
just wanted some shit that I probably wanted a little bit, a potential outrage.

2005
01:54:10.700 --> 01:54:13.790
Like this guy asking for coffee. Reparations. Yeah.

2006
01:54:13.791 --> 01:54:16.640
You got a black guy who's asking for reparations. They kind of liked that.

2007
01:54:16.670 --> 01:54:19.490
Especially when it's spoofing the left. So yeah, they, you know, they,

2008
01:54:19.610 --> 01:54:23.270
they kind of wanted to weaponize me. Yeah. Um, so yeah, there's a lot of that.

2009
01:54:23.540 --> 01:54:25.610
I thought it was funny. I thought was hilarious.

2010
01:54:26.940 --> 01:54:29.090
You were very friendly about it, you know,

2011
01:54:29.091 --> 01:54:30.920
it wasn't like you were being angry or anything.

2012
01:54:30.950 --> 01:54:33.200
Did you have your son with you or someone to yeah, my boys.

2013
01:54:33.201 --> 01:54:36.110
The whole family was at me. That's funny man. Yeah. Yeah.

2014
01:54:36.140 --> 01:54:37.370
My son didn't and he was like,

2015
01:54:37.371 --> 01:54:39.770
I told him I go here and get free coffee saying yeah, right.

2016
01:54:40.680 --> 01:54:43.240
[inaudible] I was like, your dad's really about to pull this off bro.

2017
01:54:43.310 --> 01:54:48.260
You had a debate recently about reparations with uh, CJ peers. Yes.

2018
01:54:48.261 --> 01:54:52.910
That young guy who's, um, very, he's an interesting guy.

2019
01:54:52.911 --> 01:54:55.970
Very, very intelligent and articulate fellow.

2020
01:54:55.971 --> 01:54:59.300
Isn't he like 19 years old or something like that? 16 yeah.

2021
01:54:59.470 --> 01:55:03.170
Is He really only 16? 18. Yeah. Really? Yeah, that's what they say.

2022
01:55:03.171 --> 01:55:06.110
At least I thought he was older than that.

2023
01:55:06.230 --> 01:55:10.960
He writes for Colette and he's really only 16. Yeah.

2024
01:55:11.330 --> 01:55:15.260
CJ Pearson. Is that what it is? Funny how old you is? That seems crazy.

2025
01:55:15.320 --> 01:55:20.060
It got drunk. Pays 16. Wow. It's got fucking smart as shit. No,

2026
01:55:20.150 --> 01:55:24.470
he's not, but now it's not. Why do you think he's not smart? He's not smart.

2027
01:55:25.010 --> 01:55:27.670
Smart people create things stupid place.

2028
01:55:27.690 --> 01:55:32.240
Fucking 16 you don't think he's got an exceptional vocabulary and ability to

2029
01:55:32.241 --> 01:55:34.630
express himself at 16 and what does that mean? Well,

2030
01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:37.880
it means you've got something going on. I don't need shit. It doesn't mean shit.

2031
01:55:38.060 --> 01:55:41.330
That's an exception of you. Speed is absolute sometimes.

2032
01:55:41.760 --> 01:55:43.890
What is vocabulary mean you? Some words.

2033
01:55:44.310 --> 01:55:48.780
Well you have use of them at the access. Instantaneous access.

2034
01:55:48.781 --> 01:55:50.550
That means they're in your mind all the time,

2035
01:55:50.730 --> 01:55:52.290
which means you've done a lot of reading,

2036
01:55:52.530 --> 01:55:54.000
which means you've done a lot of studying,

2037
01:55:54.001 --> 01:55:57.360
which means you have a command of the English language,

2038
01:55:57.361 --> 01:56:00.180
which was the only thing that we have. If you speak English,

2039
01:56:00.540 --> 01:56:03.270
that you can use to express your intent. Right?

2040
01:56:03.271 --> 01:56:08.271
And An Orwell talks about these political types who sound very educated.

2041
01:56:09.690 --> 01:56:11.730
He says it, they sound very educated on it. Right?

2042
01:56:11.850 --> 01:56:15.300
And then when you break down what they actually said, it's still very vague.

2043
01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:19.740
It's all very nonspecific. There's actually no solutions. You know?

2044
01:56:19.741 --> 01:56:23.940
All they do is talk about problems. What is your platform? CJ Pearson.

2045
01:56:24.570 --> 01:56:27.960
Candace hones. What is your platform? Is your platform? I Hate Democrats.

2046
01:56:28.110 --> 01:56:28.861
Is your platform.

2047
01:56:28.861 --> 01:56:31.620
I want something for the people because it seems like when you watch these

2048
01:56:31.621 --> 01:56:34.560
people, they're all saying the same thing for clicks.

2049
01:56:34.561 --> 01:56:36.870
Like I told you my homeboy, he makes all that money on Facebook.

2050
01:56:36.900 --> 01:56:41.700
He's doing the Candice SolarWinds and CJ Pearson thing for money.

2051
01:56:41.940 --> 01:56:44.460
Are they the same? They're not. They don't have the same ideology.

2052
01:56:45.420 --> 01:56:48.210
CJ Pearson's and Candice owns. They're cut from the same cloth. You think so?

2053
01:56:48.420 --> 01:56:50.490
They're the same person. He's just younger version.

2054
01:56:50.760 --> 01:56:54.050
I heard him speak on the Sam Harris show. I believe it was him. Right?

2055
01:56:54.420 --> 01:56:57.970
Was it him? CJ Sees Google that CJ Pearson on Sam p.

2056
01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:01.440
I'm pretty sure it's the same cat [inaudible] and I was very impressed.

2057
01:57:01.441 --> 01:57:03.030
Especially with some of his age. Yeah.

2058
01:57:03.031 --> 01:57:08.031
I mean he talks very wow and he was so hard to do and here in the United States

2059
01:57:08.360 --> 01:57:11.670
of America was not him after both the names and nothing. Okay.

2060
01:57:11.850 --> 01:57:15.060
Maybe it's a different dude. They have pre. That's why I thought he was older.

2061
01:57:15.270 --> 01:57:19.200
Catchphrases, preplanned, catch freezes. You're, you're learning.

2062
01:57:19.201 --> 01:57:21.950
You're just learning. Another language. And that's, that's what he's,

2063
01:57:21.951 --> 01:57:24.720
he's speaking that language. There's no digging him. That's, that's little bro,

2064
01:57:24.910 --> 01:57:26.430
you know, dig on him. I see what you're saying.

2065
01:57:26.460 --> 01:57:30.810
So you're saying that they have this sort of ideology that are subscribing to

2066
01:57:30.811 --> 01:57:32.700
this predetermined pattern of behavior.

2067
01:57:33.030 --> 01:57:37.710
They know what works and then they just follow it. Sorta like a top 40 DJ talks.

2068
01:57:37.711 --> 01:57:40.650
There you go. Right, right. You know, like what,

2069
01:57:40.660 --> 01:57:44.940
what has with new thought has he created? I don't know. He hasn't. He hasn't.

2070
01:57:44.941 --> 01:57:48.420
I just listened to that debate and, um,

2071
01:57:48.800 --> 01:57:51.750
it's a conversation that I think is a fascinating one,

2072
01:57:51.751 --> 01:57:54.660
the conversation of reparations because it can be no doubt that something

2073
01:57:54.661 --> 01:57:57.690
horrible happened to the black community and they're still suffering from it as

2074
01:57:57.960 --> 01:57:59.250
parents, especially in the deep south.

2075
01:57:59.251 --> 01:58:02.160
And you look at these places where the people who lived or the direct

2076
01:58:02.161 --> 01:58:03.180
descendants of slaves,

2077
01:58:03.570 --> 01:58:06.930
and then these are the same impoverished neighborhoods that no one's ever done

2078
01:58:06.931 --> 01:58:09.210
anything to try to fix. Right? So how do you fix it?

2079
01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:14.080
You first have to start with the subconscious mind and the black mind. Uh,

2080
01:58:14.270 --> 01:58:17.730
and the problem with the black mind is the fact that the black mind starts off

2081
01:58:17.731 --> 01:58:21.390
with a fetus mentality from the day you're born, you're taught, uh,

2082
01:58:21.420 --> 01:58:25.710
the white man's out to get you. So you start off with a boogeyman and then, um,

2083
01:58:25.770 --> 01:58:28.830
you're taught that you're a slave, right? Uh,

2084
01:58:28.920 --> 01:58:33.920
so when your subconscious mind believes that the beginnings of your race is a

2085
01:58:34.801 --> 01:58:37.650
slave, how do you aspire to be more than that?

2086
01:58:38.940 --> 01:58:42.010
So in order to correct the black community, you have to teach black

2087
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:45.940
<v 2>history or so called black history or what I would say African history and</v>

2088
01:58:45.941 --> 01:58:50.680
chronological order. Before we were slaves, we were kings. So how do you,

2089
01:58:50.770 --> 01:58:55.770
how do you have a whole entire nation of 40 some odd million black people and

2090
01:58:55.961 --> 01:59:00.710
majority of them never heard a queen Angola who never heard of the Songhai

2091
01:59:00.710 --> 01:59:04.600
Empire, the Mali Empire, you know, none of this stuff, right? King, Masa, Masa.

2092
01:59:05.170 --> 01:59:06.640
How do you, how do you,

2093
01:59:07.240 --> 01:59:10.930
how do you raise a people's level of awareness about this stuff and how do you

2094
01:59:10.960 --> 01:59:13.950
elevate them to want to do things in life when they think they are slave?

2095
01:59:14.800 --> 01:59:16.990
That's the first thing that you have to do to help black people.

2096
01:59:16.991 --> 01:59:18.220
You have to teach them who they are.

2097
01:59:18.710 --> 01:59:21.890
<v 3>That expression, before they were slaves, they were kings.</v>

2098
01:59:21.891 --> 01:59:23.150
The problem with that as a king,

2099
01:59:23.240 --> 01:59:26.420
as a monarch and a mark is one person who controls giant groups of people.

2100
01:59:26.510 --> 01:59:27.740
You can have a bunch of kings.

2101
01:59:28.230 --> 01:59:32.270
There's not a lot of kings can have a nation of kings. Correct,

2102
01:59:32.420 --> 01:59:37.250
but that's very different from saying, you know that we had four kings,

2103
01:59:37.251 --> 01:59:40.490
right? Let's say there were just four, right? That's betted insane.

2104
01:59:40.491 --> 01:59:44.030
Harry Tubman, Frederick Douglas, and these free slaves, right?

2105
01:59:44.150 --> 01:59:47.510
You actually have to see at least one king. I see what you're saying.

2106
01:59:48.050 --> 01:59:48.950
At least say so.

2107
01:59:49.490 --> 01:59:54.470
See One advanced human being that also looks like you,

2108
01:59:54.590 --> 01:59:58.400
that came from the same part of the world where your ancestors came from,

2109
01:59:58.760 --> 02:00:03.760
so recognize that the trajectory that you and your family are on as a direct

2110
02:00:05.001 --> 02:00:06.560
result of being enslaved,

2111
02:00:06.650 --> 02:00:09.830
that someone was enslaved in the past and brought over here against their will.

2112
02:00:10.160 --> 02:00:12.890
That's why there's the negative mindset.

2113
02:00:13.160 --> 02:00:17.600
That's why there's a negative self image is because there's this great history

2114
02:00:17.601 --> 02:00:20.840
of oppression. Yeah. Yeah. You know, when you think you are slave,

2115
02:00:20.841 --> 02:00:23.930
you can't operate outside of that. And even if you don't think you're a slave,

2116
02:00:23.931 --> 02:00:28.070
you think you're inferior. You know, you don't know who ms pat is. No.

2117
02:00:28.160 --> 02:00:31.400
Hilarious comedian, one of the funniest human beings alive and she was here.

2118
02:00:31.790 --> 02:00:35.420
And one thing she was talking about was when she was younger that when she would

2119
02:00:35.450 --> 02:00:38.360
see white people, she wouldn't look them in the eye. She would get nervous.

2120
02:00:38.361 --> 02:00:42.530
She felt inferior being around them. She just wanted to get away.

2121
02:00:42.531 --> 02:00:44.150
She didn't feel like she belonged. Right,

2122
02:00:44.590 --> 02:00:47.110
<v 2>right. And that's a product of not knowing who you are,</v>

2123
02:00:47.260 --> 02:00:50.080
not knowing your own personal power. You know,

2124
02:00:50.081 --> 02:00:52.630
when you look at the second Punic war as a Carthage,

2125
02:00:52.900 --> 02:00:55.840
you had a Hannah bull went through the Alps, which is an, you know,

2126
02:00:55.870 --> 02:00:58.390
mission impossible. And he went all the way to the,

2127
02:00:58.510 --> 02:01:02.010
to the doors of Rome and Rome said, Yo,

2128
02:01:02.090 --> 02:01:05.650
we ain't coming outside to fight you bro. When he come in.

2129
02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:09.100
That's how strong the power for the army was. They said, we don't want to fight.

2130
02:01:09.280 --> 02:01:13.240
They knew if they came outside those gates, they would get their ass. Whoop.

2131
02:01:13.510 --> 02:01:15.130
So how do you,

2132
02:01:15.340 --> 02:01:19.540
how do you have a people that walk around not knowing that a Hannibal,

2133
02:01:19.800 --> 02:01:22.030
a barker is a welst,

2134
02:01:22.060 --> 02:01:26.380
a studied war general today. The Pentagon still studies him.

2135
02:01:27.160 --> 02:01:30.000
Right? So how do you, how you operate in,

2136
02:01:30.001 --> 02:01:32.920
in America as a black person and not know who Annabelle Bargo goes?

2137
02:01:33.720 --> 02:01:37.260
<v 3>Well, it's difficult, I think for people that were born in American,</v>

2138
02:01:37.261 --> 02:01:40.340
all their known ancestors from America to even relate.

2139
02:01:40.430 --> 02:01:41.060
<v 2>Like I'm,</v>

2140
02:01:41.060 --> 02:01:46.060
my family's mostly from Italy and Sicily and some of them from Ireland.

2141
02:01:46.820 --> 02:01:50.720
I don't relate at all. I visited Italy in the summer times.

2142
02:01:50.721 --> 02:01:53.090
I don't relate at all. Right? So then the other,

2143
02:01:53.150 --> 02:01:55.820
the other side is the fact that we would have natives,

2144
02:01:56.300 --> 02:01:59.150
we would not brought here on slave ships.

2145
02:01:59.810 --> 02:02:03.470
That's not economically sound, just doesn't make sense. Uh,

2146
02:02:03.530 --> 02:02:06.500
so when Christopher Columbus guy he had wanted to them,

2147
02:02:06.700 --> 02:02:09.620
has got to the Caribbean according to a primary source,

2148
02:02:10.010 --> 02:02:12.140
they basically said the first thing he did was take slaves.

2149
02:02:12.530 --> 02:02:16.820
He didn't bring slaves. He took slaves from the island. He captured people.

2150
02:02:17.150 --> 02:02:18.680
So when you have colonization,

2151
02:02:18.681 --> 02:02:21.710
you gotta remember United States was only built 13 colonies at first, right?

2152
02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:26.020
You think this whole land was empty? No, there were natives here. Right?

2153
02:02:26.200 --> 02:02:29.000
But today we're taught that natives as some other people.

2154
02:02:29.150 --> 02:02:33.840
No natives are the melanated African being that has come here since the, the,

2155
02:02:33.850 --> 02:02:38.160
the, the beginning of the Mali Empire. We're talking about, uh, 14,

2156
02:02:38.161 --> 02:02:42.650
13th century. We had already come here from Africa. Really?

2157
02:02:42.830 --> 02:02:43.880
Oh yeah. Yeah.

2158
02:02:43.881 --> 02:02:48.200
We had already come here to the United States or to this land mass.

2159
02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:50.390
This land mass we call the United States.

2160
02:02:50.630 --> 02:02:54.920
So the way to the ocean current works is it works, uh, from Africa,

2161
02:02:55.540 --> 02:02:58.970
leaves out of, uh, west Africa comes to South America and the Caribbean.

2162
02:02:59.090 --> 02:03:01.430
It's just how the currents go. You don't need no paddle boat and nothing,

2163
02:03:01.600 --> 02:03:04.070
it'll just occurrence. It's take you there and then you travel up.

2164
02:03:04.280 --> 02:03:07.100
But we had already been here. All you gotta do is look up the story of

2165
02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:12.890
Sarah Erector Sai Rector's, a wealthy, so-called native American. Um,

2166
02:03:12.920 --> 02:03:15.800
I think she was a Choctaw tribe or one of these tribes,

2167
02:03:16.040 --> 02:03:18.410
but she was wealthy and uh,

2168
02:03:18.440 --> 02:03:21.410
she wanted the VIP pass to go somewhere and um,

2169
02:03:21.680 --> 02:03:24.740
they had her classified as a free person.

2170
02:03:25.190 --> 02:03:30.190
Why don't we know about the wealthy so-called black people in America?

2171
02:03:31.610 --> 02:03:35.180
Why don't we know that there were black slave owners in America?

2172
02:03:35.900 --> 02:03:40.670
Why is that not taught? Why is it not? How many blacks labels man,

2173
02:03:40.671 --> 02:03:42.620
this did the natives here had slaves.

2174
02:03:42.621 --> 02:03:45.170
They were trading slaves with the so called white man. Well,

2175
02:03:45.171 --> 02:03:48.410
they definitely did that. Natives and slave people of other tribes, right?

2176
02:03:48.411 --> 02:03:53.360
So if those, if those people are us to so-called black man,

2177
02:03:53.361 --> 02:03:55.160
if those natives were us,

2178
02:03:55.460 --> 02:04:00.460
then we have to tell that history and say how we did have territories and we

2179
02:04:01.491 --> 02:04:05.420
did, you know, carry our commerce and we weren't slaves. We were slave owners.

2180
02:04:06.250 --> 02:04:06.270
What?

2181
02:04:06.270 --> 02:04:11.270
But the majority of African Americans that lived here were brought over here.

2182
02:04:12.440 --> 02:04:15.800
No, no, no. That's not economically sound.

2183
02:04:15.830 --> 02:04:18.680
What do you mean by it's not economically sound like they're worse, let's say.

2184
02:04:19.140 --> 02:04:22.730
All right. Let's say you wanted to have a, you wanted to sell marijuana, right?

2185
02:04:22.790 --> 02:04:26.330
Right. Would you, uh, import marijuana?

2186
02:04:26.331 --> 02:04:29.420
Would you grow here if it's already here? Well,

2187
02:04:29.450 --> 02:04:32.870
it depends on whether or not marijuana grew here. Well,

2188
02:04:32.930 --> 02:04:36.500
can you have marijuana here? You can. We're just talking about marijuana.

2189
02:04:36.530 --> 02:04:38.010
Like what does that something

2190
02:04:38.010 --> 02:04:41.790
<v 1>that you can't grow here. So, so what I'm saying is people,</v>

2191
02:04:42.060 --> 02:04:43.050
we're already here.

2192
02:04:43.051 --> 02:04:47.640
Does it make sense to go all the way to this other continent to bring people on

2193
02:04:47.641 --> 02:04:50.640
a boat when we know that half Istock is going to die?

2194
02:04:51.840 --> 02:04:52.770
You wouldn't do that.

2195
02:04:52.771 --> 02:04:55.950
So how many people do you think were brought over from Africa on slave ships?

2196
02:04:56.070 --> 02:04:59.430
Cause that definitely happened. I don't believe it.

2197
02:04:59.730 --> 02:05:02.010
What do you mean you don't believe it? I don't believe that story.

2198
02:05:02.490 --> 02:05:05.850
You don't believe that Africans were brought over on slave ships, correct?

2199
02:05:06.240 --> 02:05:08.940
I believe it may have happened. You know,

2200
02:05:08.941 --> 02:05:11.400
maybe people were brought over as slaves,

2201
02:05:11.401 --> 02:05:16.401
but I don't think that the black people in America came from Africa on slave

2202
02:05:17.581 --> 02:05:20.820
ships. I believe that people that were here were slowly conquered.

2203
02:05:20.821 --> 02:05:23.970
First they got to east coast and then they started spreading out west,

2204
02:05:23.971 --> 02:05:27.270
little by little Cochran. And when you conquer a tribe, what do you do?

2205
02:05:27.271 --> 02:05:32.070
You enslaved them. Their POW yes. Right? Okay. That's what you do.

2206
02:05:32.460 --> 02:05:36.510
So you, after you conquered his tribe, you, you, you make them slaves.

2207
02:05:36.511 --> 02:05:39.900
Now how do you conquer the natives here? So let's say you got,

2208
02:05:39.901 --> 02:05:41.700
this tribe is warn against this tribe. Well,

2209
02:05:41.701 --> 02:05:44.010
this tribe goes talk to the white man. My man says, Yo,

2210
02:05:44.011 --> 02:05:46.890
if you help me wipe out these people, then boom, you know,

2211
02:05:46.891 --> 02:05:48.480
I'll help you with whatever, whatever.

2212
02:05:49.050 --> 02:05:52.110
So they get together and they wipe out this other trop and I guess what the

2213
02:05:52.111 --> 02:05:54.570
white man now out numbers this trop say he wipes them out.

2214
02:05:54.750 --> 02:05:57.960
You just killed two birds with one stone. You just keep moving like that.

2215
02:05:58.080 --> 02:05:59.070
But I'm still confused.

2216
02:05:59.260 --> 02:06:04.260
There's a great history of slave ships being brought over from Africa with

2217
02:06:04.321 --> 02:06:07.440
Africans. That became slaves and worked in the south.

2218
02:06:08.190 --> 02:06:12.000
So that you think that's lies? History is his story, right?

2219
02:06:12.240 --> 02:06:15.930
What about my story is my story now valley,

2220
02:06:15.990 --> 02:06:20.990
but if you do 23 in me on someone from these parts of the country,

2221
02:06:21.870 --> 02:06:26.800
you'll find out 20 days. That's real. So, so there's 23 and me. So when I,

2222
02:06:26.801 --> 02:06:29.870
when I, when I take a a 23 and me test, right? Yes.

2223
02:06:29.940 --> 02:06:32.370
What's it going to tell me about Africa? That's a good question.

2224
02:06:32.371 --> 02:06:34.290
We should find out. We going to say, Oh,

2225
02:06:34.291 --> 02:06:39.040
you're from Kenya or you're from Angola, you're from this, this, right, right.

2226
02:06:39.420 --> 02:06:40.950
These things,

2227
02:06:40.951 --> 02:06:45.930
these borders were created by Europe in terms, yes.

2228
02:06:46.410 --> 02:06:49.800
In terms of like what parts of Africa and how it's distributed and what's a

2229
02:06:49.801 --> 02:06:54.730
country and what's not a country. Yeah. Afrikaners and Dutch. Yeah.

2230
02:06:54.840 --> 02:06:59.550
Okay. So you can't classify me based upon a European name.

2231
02:06:59.860 --> 02:07:04.860
I understand that. But they're saying geographically geographic location,

2232
02:07:04.861 --> 02:07:06.600
you can call it whatever name you want. Right.

2233
02:07:06.750 --> 02:07:09.990
They can tell you where your genetics originated.

2234
02:07:10.290 --> 02:07:13.010
Like I've got some weird shit in me. I got like 1% Asian.

2235
02:07:13.011 --> 02:07:15.420
I don't know why it's there. 1.6% African.

2236
02:07:15.810 --> 02:07:19.440
There's also the weird stuff that you find in your DNA then like your ancestors

2237
02:07:19.441 --> 02:07:23.340
and ancestors. Ancestors. So let's with someone, let's walk down that path,

2238
02:07:23.341 --> 02:07:26.250
right? So either way,

2239
02:07:26.340 --> 02:07:28.620
if you take black people here in America,

2240
02:07:28.980 --> 02:07:31.880
do they DNA sample and it point back to Africa. What does that say?

2241
02:07:31.910 --> 02:07:36.310
Says Black people in America are Africans. Now the argument where we brought

2242
02:07:36.310 --> 02:07:37.870
<v 2>here or where we already here,</v>

2243
02:07:38.350 --> 02:07:42.070
did we bring ourselves here or did the white man bring us here? You see,

2244
02:07:42.071 --> 02:07:43.780
when you say to white man brought us here,

2245
02:07:43.990 --> 02:07:48.990
which are doing is you're removing our ability to transport ourselves.

2246
02:07:49.991 --> 02:07:53.760
You're saying, oh, we didn't know anything about boats. That's a draw. Tommy.

2247
02:07:53.770 --> 02:07:56.350
You try to tell me that we didn't know that there was a landmass here.

2248
02:07:56.560 --> 02:08:01.420
The only the, the holy white man knew there was land to the west.

2249
02:08:02.200 --> 02:08:04.660
But when you look at the holy white man, he said, when we got here,

2250
02:08:04.661 --> 02:08:07.440
we met black people. Go look at the primary source is the guy.

2251
02:08:07.570 --> 02:08:09.580
We met black people. When you got to Caribbean, me, my black people.

2252
02:08:09.760 --> 02:08:13.360
You think the Caribbean is right next to America and a Warren in America.

2253
02:08:15.210 --> 02:08:17.980
<v 3>That's interesting. Does it make any sense? Well,</v>

2254
02:08:18.150 --> 02:08:22.260
are you going to setup sense that you do have people that have traveled,

2255
02:08:22.261 --> 02:08:25.110
whether it's Polynesians, have traveled to Hawaii or people,

2256
02:08:25.320 --> 02:08:27.130
I mean there's the old Mex, uh,

2257
02:08:27.750 --> 02:08:29.940
thousands and thousands of years ago in South America.

2258
02:08:29.941 --> 02:08:33.470
They have computerly clearly African faces. Yes.

2259
02:08:33.860 --> 02:08:36.630
I mean really letting the noses, the lips, I mean,

2260
02:08:36.631 --> 02:08:40.410
they look African and that was a South American culture that existed and we

2261
02:08:40.411 --> 02:08:43.920
don't know anything about them other than the fact that they have these gigantic

2262
02:08:44.390 --> 02:08:46.220
stones, sculptures that have African faces.

2263
02:08:46.500 --> 02:08:50.400
<v 2>Like again, again, just go to have, you can pull up the ocean currents.</v>

2264
02:08:51.630 --> 02:08:55.980
I've seen that. You've seen I met caucus. I've heard about him. Yeah.

2265
02:08:56.290 --> 02:08:59.740
<v 3>Read his stuff. It's really fascinating because he's all about that.</v>

2266
02:08:59.741 --> 02:09:04.741
He's all about the fact that the idea that human beings were probably living in

2267
02:09:04.991 --> 02:09:07.960
advanced civilizations far longer than 14,000 years ago.

2268
02:09:08.470 --> 02:09:12.700
They did travel all over the world and that you do find the remanence of these

2269
02:09:12.701 --> 02:09:16.420
ancient cultures that we have no explanation for throughout the Amazon,

2270
02:09:16.720 --> 02:09:19.240
you know, and throughout different parts of, of uh,

2271
02:09:19.330 --> 02:09:20.940
South America and Central America.

2272
02:09:20.970 --> 02:09:24.600
<v 2>I mean, when you go and you look at rail European history,</v>

2273
02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:30.920
you had the Magyars would believe that if they took a bath that was bad,

2274
02:09:32.550 --> 02:09:35.010
right? They didn't even want to change their clothes.

2275
02:09:35.040 --> 02:09:37.770
They thought that dirty was purity.

2276
02:09:38.250 --> 02:09:42.240
When we talk about the Moore's going into Spain and into Europe,

2277
02:09:42.930 --> 02:09:45.390
the stories in the history,

2278
02:09:46.260 --> 02:09:50.640
our history says that when we met the so called Caucasian,

2279
02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.400
he was sleeping in the barn with the animals and we told him, no,

2280
02:09:53.401 --> 02:09:56.430
you can't sleep in the barn was animals. We taught them etiquette.

2281
02:09:56.460 --> 02:10:00.000
We taught them running water. We brought that technology to Europe.

2282
02:10:00.300 --> 02:10:04.620
Now if we brought the technology to Europe that saved Europe from the black

2283
02:10:04.621 --> 02:10:09.420
plague, you mean to tell me that if we save the white race,

2284
02:10:09.630 --> 02:10:13.290
that we weren't already in America already when we brought the technology,

2285
02:10:13.710 --> 02:10:16.710
when Rome was depending on Africa for food.

2286
02:10:17.220 --> 02:10:20.310
I remember when a black print black plague hitting Rome.

2287
02:10:20.700 --> 02:10:24.090
The cause was uh, one of the, uh,

2288
02:10:24.091 --> 02:10:27.900
officials was still in the green. I was coming from Africa,

2289
02:10:29.130 --> 02:10:31.170
so there was famine hit Rome.

2290
02:10:32.100 --> 02:10:34.160
F Your source of

2291
02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:38.930
<v 1>sustenance is from Africa. How will you superior?</v>

2292
02:10:41.180 --> 02:10:45.950
You're not, you get your full from me. So if you get your full from me,

2293
02:10:46.040 --> 02:10:49.340
who's more likely to travel this globe may,

2294
02:10:49.341 --> 02:10:53.390
I'm the source of food and that's the first thing you need to survive on this

2295
02:10:53.391 --> 02:10:55.700
planet. So if your whole civilization is dependent me to plot,

2296
02:10:55.730 --> 02:11:00.080
to plot too dependent on me to supply fool, I made it to America first.

2297
02:11:00.320 --> 02:11:02.540
It's just that you won the war and you've got to tell the story.

2298
02:11:02.710 --> 02:11:06.530
Is that their only source of food? I mean it's a source of food that Rome had.

2299
02:11:06.531 --> 02:11:10.010
Right, but Rome is also very close to Africa. Let's talk about that.

2300
02:11:10.011 --> 02:11:14.270
What kinds of food did they have? Well, I don't know. It's a very rudimentary,

2301
02:11:14.271 --> 02:11:16.760
it was a very rudimentary civilization.

2302
02:11:16.761 --> 02:11:19.760
It wasn't all a what is cracked up to be.

2303
02:11:19.940 --> 02:11:23.410
When you go look at what the Greek said about Egypt. When you go into Egypt,

2304
02:11:23.550 --> 02:11:26.540
it's like Yo, it's like the New York City of that time. The ultimate,

2305
02:11:26.660 --> 02:11:31.340
if you really want to talk about African civilization being advanced Egypt as

2306
02:11:31.341 --> 02:11:35.180
the ultimate because Egypt to this day is still unexplained.

2307
02:11:35.960 --> 02:11:38.000
No one really understands how they built those things.

2308
02:11:38.001 --> 02:11:40.880
No one understands the how old the culture is.

2309
02:11:41.180 --> 02:11:45.320
That's another thing that Graham Hancock and doctor Robert Schoch from Boston

2310
02:11:45.320 --> 02:11:46.250
University who a geologist,

2311
02:11:46.251 --> 02:11:50.060
he's pointing to water erosion and the temple of the Sphinx.

2312
02:11:50.061 --> 02:11:55.061
That leads you to believe that that place might have been as old as 9,000 plus

2313
02:11:55.551 --> 02:12:00.020
BC. So it absolutely is. Yeah. If not older fellow Ramsey's.

2314
02:12:00.050 --> 02:12:03.020
There's also different styles of architecture, right?

2315
02:12:03.021 --> 02:12:05.930
There's some older styles of architecture they find deeper in the sand.

2316
02:12:05.931 --> 02:12:09.020
They think it might've been indicative of an earlier kingdom.

2317
02:12:09.050 --> 02:12:12.350
And then there's also the new bian structures of some of the faces,

2318
02:12:12.650 --> 02:12:15.530
particularly the Sphinx. Yeah. You know, the Sphinx,

2319
02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:17.510
they believe had a lion's face.

2320
02:12:17.511 --> 02:12:19.460
And then when they were conquered by the Nubians,

2321
02:12:19.461 --> 02:12:24.420
they changed the actual structure of the face of this face and turned it into a

2322
02:12:24.440 --> 02:12:25.700
a king's face.

2323
02:12:25.760 --> 02:12:29.270
What a way it was told to me was that it is upper and Lower Egypt.

2324
02:12:29.330 --> 02:12:33.170
So a Upper Egypt is actually our new south, right? That's our south.

2325
02:12:33.530 --> 02:12:37.250
And what the way it's taught to me was that was the mind of Egypt.

2326
02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:42.520
And the economic section of Egypt was what we see Giza pyramids.

2327
02:12:43.040 --> 02:12:44.990
And it's economic. Because if you look at it,

2328
02:12:45.090 --> 02:12:47.540
it sits between three continents on the Mediterranean Sea.

2329
02:12:47.690 --> 02:12:51.200
So it's a perfect place to carry out commerce. It's the perfect place.

2330
02:12:51.201 --> 02:12:54.530
That's why everybody wants to be there. That's why as a war in the Middle East,

2331
02:12:54.650 --> 02:12:55.760
because it's the perfect place to be.

2332
02:12:56.090 --> 02:13:00.440
So do you believe that some Africans came over here and slave ships or none?

2333
02:13:01.460 --> 02:13:05.900
Very minimal. Very minimal. Really minimal. So you think it's a myth almost.

2334
02:13:06.710 --> 02:13:08.990
Now, does there any scholars that support these opinions?

2335
02:13:08.991 --> 02:13:12.110
Are these your opinions or where are you getting this from? So

2336
02:13:13.790 --> 02:13:18.590
here's the thing, this is stuff I've studied probably close to 15 years ago,

2337
02:13:19.040 --> 02:13:22.100
so I don't remember a lot of my sources or who I learned it from.

2338
02:13:22.101 --> 02:13:23.360
But I can give you a couple of names.

2339
02:13:23.361 --> 02:13:25.880
What you gotta do is you gotta look up Shaka outmost.

2340
02:13:25.980 --> 02:13:30.110
You gotta look up Dr Cabo Kamin, Dr Phil Valentine, Bobby Hemet.

2341
02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:32.130
Uh, who else is a good eater?

2342
02:13:32.550 --> 02:13:33.383
<v 2>Tyler's up.</v>

2343
02:13:33.790 --> 02:13:36.980
Shark atmos is a real good egyptologist I think you should start deal with Shaka

2344
02:13:37.530 --> 02:13:39.090
atmos, but um, these are,

2345
02:13:39.091 --> 02:13:42.000
these are videos I used to watch and Lexis I used to watch back in a day.

2346
02:13:42.001 --> 02:13:44.310
Now I focus on like startups. That's where my brain is.

2347
02:13:44.580 --> 02:13:46.770
That's where my knowledge is focused on, right?

2348
02:13:46.800 --> 02:13:50.730
But a lot of this stuff comes from my own common sense.

2349
02:13:51.660 --> 02:13:56.660
It just does not make sense logistically to take people from all the way from

2350
02:13:57.361 --> 02:13:59.520
over there to bring them here,

2351
02:13:59.700 --> 02:14:03.240
especially when half your stock is going to die when you got people right here,

2352
02:14:03.420 --> 02:14:06.390
you have human resources right here. All I got to do is pop them,

2353
02:14:06.630 --> 02:14:09.690
shoot a couple of them. The rest of them are like, all right, fine,

2354
02:14:09.720 --> 02:14:13.410
and you enslave them and none of them died except for the ones I actually

2355
02:14:13.411 --> 02:14:15.840
killed. Right? And I got a whole millions of people right here. Like,

2356
02:14:15.841 --> 02:14:19.560
why would I go all the crazy all the way across the ocean to bring people back

2357
02:14:19.561 --> 02:14:22.650
across the ocean? That's it. This doesn't make sense. It's a stupid that,

2358
02:14:22.651 --> 02:14:26.550
didn't nobody run a business like that. What's up Jim?

2359
02:14:29.370 --> 02:14:32.670
PBS? How many the title was?

2360
02:14:32.671 --> 02:14:35.230
How many slaves landed in the U F [inaudible].

2361
02:14:36.180 --> 02:14:39.060
<v 3>Well, scroll that up. Scroll it up so I can read that whole thing. Okay.</v>

2362
02:14:39.330 --> 02:14:42.330
Right there. Perhaps you like me.

2363
02:14:42.540 --> 02:14:45.210
We're raised essentially to think of the slave experience per mile in terms of

2364
02:14:45.211 --> 02:14:47.520
our black ancestors here in the United States. In other words,

2365
02:14:48.470 --> 02:14:50.160
slavery is primarily about us, right?

2366
02:14:50.161 --> 02:14:54.840
From the Crispus attacks and Phillip Wheatley, Benjamin Banneker,

2367
02:14:54.841 --> 02:14:58.020
and Richard Allen, all the way to Harriet Tubman. So Jordan,

2368
02:14:58.021 --> 02:14:59.520
truth and Frederick Douglas.

2369
02:14:59.521 --> 02:15:04.140
Think of it as an instance we were might think of as African American

2370
02:15:04.141 --> 02:15:06.870
exceptionalism. In other words, that is the black experience.

2371
02:15:06.960 --> 02:15:10.560
It's got to be about black Americans. Well, black Americans will think again,

2372
02:15:10.561 --> 02:15:13.530
the most comprehensive analysis of shipping records over the course of slave

2373
02:15:13.531 --> 02:15:18.180
trade is the transatlantic slave trade database edited by professors,

2374
02:15:18.181 --> 02:15:20.610
David [inaudible] and David Richardson.

2375
02:15:20.611 --> 02:15:23.370
While the editors are careful to say that all the figures are estimates,

2376
02:15:23.371 --> 02:15:27.240
they believe that the best estimates that we have that proverbial gold standard

2377
02:15:27.241 --> 02:15:32.241
in the field of study of the slave trade between 1525 and 1866 the in the entire

2378
02:15:33.451 --> 02:15:35.160
history of the slave trade to the new world,

2379
02:15:35.161 --> 02:15:38.160
according to the Trans Atlantic slave trade database,

2380
02:15:38.161 --> 02:15:43.161
12.5 million Africans were shipped to the new world.

2381
02:15:43.590 --> 02:15:48.590
10.7 million survived the dreaded middle passage disembarking in North America,

2382
02:15:49.950 --> 02:15:51.810
the Caribbean and South America.

2383
02:15:52.110 --> 02:15:57.110
How many of those 10.7 million Africans were shipped directly to North America?

2384
02:15:58.200 --> 02:16:03.090
Only about 388,000 that's right. A tiny percentage.

2385
02:16:03.360 --> 02:16:07.410
So a small percentage of all the Africans that were enslaved were actually

2386
02:16:07.411 --> 02:16:08.580
shipped to North America.

2387
02:16:08.700 --> 02:16:11.930
That was probably closer to truth to any come from Africa, bro.

2388
02:16:12.020 --> 02:16:14.310
That don't make no sense. Nobody ever run a business like that. Well,

2389
02:16:14.311 --> 02:16:18.330
they just saying that a lot of people did though. That's 10.7 million people.

2390
02:16:18.330 --> 02:16:22.730
<v 2>People came on boats. That's what they're saying. That's a true slave trade.</v>

2391
02:16:22.731 --> 02:16:24.560
I don't know if that means that they necessarily came here.

2392
02:16:24.561 --> 02:16:26.850
They could have been going to Europe. They know that they were [inaudible].

2393
02:16:26.950 --> 02:16:29.920
They were saying that it was in the Caribbean trade does have to come from

2394
02:16:29.921 --> 02:16:30.754
Africa.

2395
02:16:30.970 --> 02:16:33.160
<v 0>I can trade with you right here in America.</v>

2396
02:16:33.190 --> 02:16:38.190
But was it to directly to North America is only the under 400,000 right?

2397
02:16:38.380 --> 02:16:41.140
Right. Involved in the shipping and going all over the world.

2398
02:16:41.650 --> 02:16:45.910
It could be going anywhere from Africa that's less than 10% African shipped.

2399
02:16:46.090 --> 02:16:49.450
Yes. That's less than 10% less than 10% in North America,

2400
02:16:49.451 --> 02:16:54.200
but 10.7 million Africans in slaves. Whoa. And moved, wouldn't,

2401
02:16:54.270 --> 02:16:57.190
yeah, 10.7 survive. Right. Were were shipped,

2402
02:16:57.191 --> 02:16:59.380
but it didn't say where they were shipped. It's just to the new world.

2403
02:16:59.381 --> 02:17:04.270
New World is very vague. Arbitrary. Only 388,000 actually made it to this,

2404
02:17:04.300 --> 02:17:07.980
to North America. This land from Haiti or Jamaica or South.

2405
02:17:08.500 --> 02:17:10.450
So you think. Yeah. Right.

2406
02:17:10.480 --> 02:17:14.830
So you think that there was probably already a significant population of

2407
02:17:15.100 --> 02:17:19.720
Africans that were sea bearing that made it all the way over here? Yes. Well,

2408
02:17:19.721 --> 02:17:24.410
if you listen to the words of Hancock and the discussion of prehistoric,

2409
02:17:24.460 --> 02:17:27.610
what we would consider pre historic use of boats and ships,

2410
02:17:27.611 --> 02:17:29.980
it's probably likely like look at ancient Egypt.

2411
02:17:29.981 --> 02:17:33.140
Don't you see pictures of boats? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. So they would bury them.

2412
02:17:33.141 --> 02:17:37.140
I mean if you could, there was the, um, what is the big science, uh,

2413
02:17:37.300 --> 02:17:41.250
museum in La that had the, the Egypt, uh,

2414
02:17:41.350 --> 02:17:44.170
exhibit really recently. It's fucking incredible.

2415
02:17:44.350 --> 02:17:48.460
But they had a depiction of the boats they used. Yeah, I mean,

2416
02:17:48.461 --> 02:17:50.620
they had boats for sure. They definitely traveled.

2417
02:17:50.630 --> 02:17:50.931
<v 1>So,</v>

2418
02:17:50.931 --> 02:17:55.931
so how can you tell me that a civilization had boats before Europe was literate,

2419
02:17:57.770 --> 02:18:02.660
didn't come to America, didn't set up shop. It's just not common.

2420
02:18:02.690 --> 02:18:04.970
I mean, just, I don't need to read a book to understand that,

2421
02:18:05.510 --> 02:18:08.450
but definitely makes sense if they made it to South America. I mean,

2422
02:18:08.451 --> 02:18:12.740
if the old macs were, I mean if you look at, you'd pull up a, an image of a,

2423
02:18:12.741 --> 02:18:16.040
the Almac heads. This is heavily disputed.

2424
02:18:16.670 --> 02:18:20.870
John Henry Clark is author. You should study. John Henry Clark has a book.

2425
02:18:20.871 --> 02:18:24.770
They come before Columbus. I mean, look at that. I mean, these all mek heads,

2426
02:18:24.830 --> 02:18:28.790
they all looked like that. I sought the America. Yeah. So it kind of,

2427
02:18:28.940 --> 02:18:30.470
if you have a hazing you,

2428
02:18:30.640 --> 02:18:33.650
there has to be a large population of people in order to create these things,

2429
02:18:33.820 --> 02:18:35.690
right. It has to be, you know, these have to be advanced.

2430
02:18:35.720 --> 02:18:38.000
So if they're here already in South America,

2431
02:18:38.210 --> 02:18:40.250
why are you going to go across the sea when you got people right here?

2432
02:18:40.251 --> 02:18:43.340
You get this in slave south, America's connected to America.

2433
02:18:43.341 --> 02:18:46.030
You think we didn't come up north and they ready to take that work. Right.

2434
02:18:46.480 --> 02:18:47.780
It's just common sense. Well,

2435
02:18:47.781 --> 02:18:50.870
particularly when they're finding all this evidence of people that were here

2436
02:18:50.900 --> 02:18:54.060
thousands and thousands of years before they ever thought people were. Yeah.

2437
02:18:54.790 --> 02:18:56.780
All the evidence in the Grand Canyon from Egypt.

2438
02:18:57.320 --> 02:19:01.640
What I don't know about that is that you heard about that?

2439
02:19:02.770 --> 02:19:04.660
There might be some gold down there. Oh,

2440
02:19:05.470 --> 02:19:07.850
there's this Egyptian gold in the Grand Canyon. Hey,

2441
02:19:08.410 --> 02:19:10.240
imagine if they found a fucking Egyptian tomb.

2442
02:19:10.850 --> 02:19:14.060
There's Egyptian stuff that's been found in Ohio. Yeah, yeah.

2443
02:19:15.850 --> 02:19:18.330
<v 0>Well I was looking some stuff up at grandma's telling me I'd went home and</v>

2444
02:19:18.331 --> 02:19:21.330
looked up the separate mount stuff and like right up the road from where the

2445
02:19:21.620 --> 02:19:21.991
separate mountain is.

2446
02:19:21.991 --> 02:19:24.870
There's been a couple of artifacts found there like a hundred years ago.

2447
02:19:24.871 --> 02:19:28.340
Artifacts and coal mountain pull that up. Yeah. There's mounds

2448
02:19:28.340 --> 02:19:32.210
<v 1>in America, which yeah, it's supposed to be like paramedics or whatever. So</v>

2449
02:19:32.630 --> 02:19:34.730
<v 4>Egypt, Ohio. I don't think it's named after that,</v>

2450
02:19:34.731 --> 02:19:37.980
but it's literally like in the same spot. Yeah.

2451
02:19:38.140 --> 02:19:41.630
<v 1>Yeah. There's this, this, this, this history of human travel.</v>

2452
02:19:41.740 --> 02:19:45.570
It's fucking fascinating. Circumnavigated this globe before, man, this,

2453
02:19:45.610 --> 02:19:48.100
this isn't new stuff. It's new to Europe.

2454
02:19:48.610 --> 02:19:52.660
It wasn't new to the African race man, Eh, we, we been here,

2455
02:19:52.720 --> 02:19:56.230
they got the mounds, the archeological evidence from Egypt in the Grand Canyon.

2456
02:19:56.500 --> 02:19:59.320
It's right there. See, I've never heard that before. That is interesting.

2457
02:19:59.360 --> 02:20:03.550
The archaeological evidence in the Grand Canyon is not part of his story.

2458
02:20:04.630 --> 02:20:07.870
He's got to keep you thinking he's got to keep the black people thinking you

2459
02:20:07.871 --> 02:20:10.180
were slaves and you came from Africa on boats.

2460
02:20:10.390 --> 02:20:11.650
That's what they got to keep you ticking.

2461
02:20:11.890 --> 02:20:14.680
But you really think that there's some sort of a grand conspiracy withholding

2462
02:20:14.800 --> 02:20:19.660
information. Yeah. The universities, scholars,

2463
02:20:19.661 --> 02:20:21.910
all these people that are talking about the history of the world,

2464
02:20:22.510 --> 02:20:25.840
universities are indoctrination centers still.

2465
02:20:25.890 --> 02:20:29.380
The worst thing you could do is send a child to college unless they're going to

2466
02:20:29.381 --> 02:20:30.610
learn a hard science.

2467
02:20:31.300 --> 02:20:34.210
You know when you go to wait a minute and you think gender studies is bullshit,

2468
02:20:35.380 --> 02:20:39.190
of course is boys in it. What are you saying? These make-believe degrees,

2469
02:20:39.370 --> 02:20:42.850
gender studies, Bro. Serious stuff. Yeah. Gender study. You know,

2470
02:20:43.180 --> 02:20:44.950
it's a social construct. I stand it.

2471
02:20:44.980 --> 02:20:47.910
I study gender in the bedroom and my girl bomp bomp bomp on.

2472
02:20:48.520 --> 02:20:49.990
That's why I study gender. Okay.

2473
02:20:50.680 --> 02:20:54.070
And no such thing as no genders texts in school tell me. But there is,

2474
02:20:54.071 --> 02:20:58.060
you can pay for it and be in debt for studying gender studies.

2475
02:20:58.360 --> 02:21:02.830
You can get a fat degree. Yeah. Do you a you find anything about the Egyptian?

2476
02:21:02.960 --> 02:21:03.550
Yeah,

2477
02:21:03.550 --> 02:21:07.450
<v 4>when I found it I was down a deep hole. So like I can't just find it that way.</v>

2478
02:21:07.451 --> 02:21:10.090
I'm trying to, I sent it to somebody so I'm going to, I'll find it in a second.

2479
02:21:11.800 --> 02:21:14.470
Google here. I just found the picture found. Pull it up.

2480
02:21:15.260 --> 02:21:19.320
<v 1>Oh. See some shit. This is, this is the hoteps got to get his glasses on.</v>

2481
02:21:19.410 --> 02:21:23.110
We're getting serious. This is the good stuff, man.

2482
02:21:23.190 --> 02:21:26.550
That we look at his head. You see his head right there? Yeah.

2483
02:21:26.580 --> 02:21:30.360
That's not nappy hair. Um, well that's a tie. Buddha.

2484
02:21:30.361 --> 02:21:33.660
So that's not his hair. Well I think those are braids.

2485
02:21:33.661 --> 02:21:37.560
This was like an ornamental braids. A lot of people including the Romans. Oh,

2486
02:21:37.561 --> 02:21:40.440
like Rachel Dosa don't lose. Oh, what is this

2487
02:21:40.800 --> 02:21:43.460
<v 4>draw? This is from an old book. That's what I was telling. It's really old.</v>

2488
02:21:43.560 --> 02:21:46.770
This is a drawing of all the inscriptions that were found on this piece of

2489
02:21:46.771 --> 02:21:51.540
stone. And a lot of these are very, they're like hieroglyphs and whatnot.

2490
02:21:52.040 --> 02:21:54.090
See Attendance. A couple of, there's like a somewhere on, here's that.

2491
02:21:54.150 --> 02:21:58.020
I think that looks just like that serpent from the mountain that's in Ohio. Wow.

2492
02:21:58.110 --> 02:22:02.220
Yeah. I forget what effect does necessarily Egyptian, but it certainly,

2493
02:22:03.090 --> 02:22:04.980
it might not be Egyptian necessarily,

2494
02:22:04.981 --> 02:22:06.750
but when I found it that's what it was tagged as.

2495
02:22:06.780 --> 02:22:09.900
It could be just from that time period or very similar, but

2496
02:22:10.720 --> 02:22:15.040
<v 1>that's is the Pennsylvania archeologist is what the book is found from. Okay.</v>

2497
02:22:15.730 --> 02:22:17.710
Just how I got to it. I'd never seen this before,

2498
02:22:17.711 --> 02:22:22.540
but there is some archeological evidence on the walls. Like you said,

2499
02:22:22.660 --> 02:22:25.240
a lot of people don't even know that Egypt's in Africa. This is hilarious.

2500
02:22:25.350 --> 02:22:25.980
You start talking to

2501
02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:30.750
<v 0>people about, look, think about that African culture. Why do change is Africa?</v>

2502
02:22:30.780 --> 02:22:35.670
Why don't they want the seven wonders of the world to be associated with Africa?

2503
02:22:35.910 --> 02:22:38.870
Well, because Africa is a continent, I guess they think of it in terms of,

2504
02:22:39.570 --> 02:22:43.720
cause you Egypt is so unbelievably unique globally. Yeah.

2505
02:22:43.850 --> 02:22:48.450
Like there's nothing like it in the world. We know Stone Ages in Europe. Yeah.

2506
02:22:48.480 --> 02:22:51.540
But Stonehenge is clunky in comparison to the shit that you find in Egypt.

2507
02:22:51.570 --> 02:22:56.490
Oh yeah. It is. But they, but they, they, they still pop up Stonehenge.

2508
02:22:56.491 --> 02:22:58.920
Like it's some great thing and you know, it's in Europe. Yeah.

2509
02:22:59.400 --> 02:23:02.400
Stonehedge is fascinating. Right? It's fascinating. Like, hmm, why they do this?

2510
02:23:02.401 --> 02:23:03.600
There's a lot of shit in Europe too.

2511
02:23:03.601 --> 02:23:06.240
They're finding now with lidar where they're using this a,

2512
02:23:06.540 --> 02:23:11.540
they can map into the ground and find these structures and roads and pathways

2513
02:23:11.941 --> 02:23:16.350
that existed and the long since been reclaimed by nature. Yeah.

2514
02:23:16.490 --> 02:23:17.251
You're finding that like,

2515
02:23:17.251 --> 02:23:20.640
this was one of the Graham Hancock things and he was talking about how you look

2516
02:23:20.641 --> 02:23:22.920
at South America when they're going through the Amazon,

2517
02:23:23.190 --> 02:23:26.520
you're finding these incredible structures and incredible roadways and

2518
02:23:26.521 --> 02:23:28.090
irrigations and that. Huh?

2519
02:23:28.170 --> 02:23:31.500
They believe that at one point in time there was civilization of 20 million

2520
02:23:31.501 --> 02:23:35.010
people living in the Amazon and that when the European settlers came over,

2521
02:23:35.220 --> 02:23:39.270
they brought smallpox and wiped everybody out. Bone. Yeah. Bone.

2522
02:23:39.390 --> 02:23:40.980
Just like they did with the native Americans.

2523
02:23:40.981 --> 02:23:44.010
A sad thing that people don't know when they talk about native American

2524
02:23:44.011 --> 02:23:48.900
genocide, the vast majority is disease. Disease. Yeah. So when people say,

2525
02:23:48.930 --> 02:23:51.210
Oh, you know, the white man came over here with violence, I'm like, Nah,

2526
02:23:51.211 --> 02:23:52.200
I don't know if he was that violent.

2527
02:23:52.201 --> 02:23:54.300
I don't think that he had enough bullets to kill that many people.

2528
02:23:54.360 --> 02:23:58.720
They killed 90% with disease state disease. Man, it's just fucking crazy.

2529
02:23:58.770 --> 02:24:03.720
The way to disease come from Europe, dirty people. So, so how can the streets,

2530
02:24:03.810 --> 02:24:07.300
so how can you tell me that, you know, uh,

2531
02:24:07.740 --> 02:24:11.280
I'm just a slave, right. When the filth,

2532
02:24:11.281 --> 02:24:14.520
the degeneration of Europe is what came to America.

2533
02:24:14.820 --> 02:24:17.760
Greatness didn't come to America. Degeneration came to American.

2534
02:24:17.761 --> 02:24:19.530
Some greatness did to, I mean this,

2535
02:24:19.531 --> 02:24:22.680
I mean when we talk about the people that came here,

2536
02:24:22.710 --> 02:24:25.500
they were escaping the oppression of yes, Europe,

2537
02:24:25.590 --> 02:24:28.590
they are the undesirables in Europe. Right.

2538
02:24:28.740 --> 02:24:32.340
Or the people would try to get away from religious persecution, right?

2539
02:24:32.550 --> 02:24:36.750
Things like that. Yeah. But these were the dregs of the society, right?

2540
02:24:36.910 --> 02:24:38.160
In many ways. Yeah. Yeah.

2541
02:24:38.310 --> 02:24:42.860
So you come here and you're dirty and you infect the people and then maybe not.

2542
02:24:42.861 --> 02:24:45.870
That's why you got to go to Africa ways cause you to go there.

2543
02:24:46.250 --> 02:24:48.450
Everybody have it there cause everybody's done. Dude, what,

2544
02:24:48.690 --> 02:24:51.360
what if you had to,

2545
02:24:51.510 --> 02:24:53.830
like if you were speaking in front of Congress yeah.

2546
02:24:53.930 --> 02:24:56.700
When you were talking about reparations, what would you have to say?

2547
02:24:57.210 --> 02:25:00.690
Keep the conversation going. Open up the conversation.

2548
02:25:00.720 --> 02:25:05.220
Let's get more minds involved. Um, don't shoot it down.

2549
02:25:05.800 --> 02:25:07.440
Uh, in Dems must pay, you know,

2550
02:25:07.520 --> 02:25:12.150
I've got the Hashtag on Dems must pay wide dems cause this is a great start.

2551
02:25:12.151 --> 02:25:15.510
Number one. So, you know, when we had the debate with CJ Paris and he said,

2552
02:25:15.511 --> 02:25:16.920
you know, in his rant, you know,

2553
02:25:16.921 --> 02:25:19.650
he went off about [inaudible] and he said if anything,

2554
02:25:19.651 --> 02:25:24.180
the dams should pay as deliberate rules because they had the KKK had they own

2555
02:25:24.190 --> 02:25:27.280
<v 1>slavery, they ran the slave trade, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah. So it was like,</v>

2556
02:25:27.281 --> 02:25:30.790
well if that's the case then why don't we make them pay. The other thing is,

2557
02:25:30.791 --> 02:25:33.430
you know, if you're conservative and you, you know, you have in this, uh,

2558
02:25:33.520 --> 02:25:35.230
elect election race or whatever,

2559
02:25:35.530 --> 02:25:38.050
why don't you just take the wildcard away from them, you know,

2560
02:25:38.051 --> 02:25:40.450
from the left and say, well, yeah, you know,

2561
02:25:40.451 --> 02:25:44.650
if there is a reparations conversation, you know, that was the Democrats.

2562
02:25:44.651 --> 02:25:47.860
That was the Dixie correct. That installed black codes in South Carolina.

2563
02:25:48.280 --> 02:25:51.430
They're the ones that, um, that's an interesting conversation, right?

2564
02:25:51.431 --> 02:25:55.510
When you say that and like, Whoa, wait, what does that actually,

2565
02:25:55.511 --> 02:25:57.430
the Democrats are responsible. Yeah.

2566
02:25:57.431 --> 02:26:02.431
You had the thing called black coats and if you were considered black,

2567
02:26:03.610 --> 02:26:05.410
then you didn't have rights.

2568
02:26:05.920 --> 02:26:09.100
The funny thing is you could be technically African and be white.

2569
02:26:10.390 --> 02:26:13.960
White isn't a color, it's a status. Elon Musk,

2570
02:26:15.520 --> 02:26:19.000
what do you mean it's from Africa? Everything. Yup. Wow. I knew that,

2571
02:26:19.270 --> 02:26:22.510
but he's not an African, well, he was born in Africa,

2572
02:26:22.690 --> 02:26:27.280
but he's not in African and South African, but so, so when we do his a 23andme,

2573
02:26:27.281 --> 02:26:30.580
what does is probably Dutch or something [inaudible] something from Europe.

2574
02:26:30.640 --> 02:26:31.900
Okay, yeah. See what I'm saying?

2575
02:26:31.930 --> 02:26:36.310
But there's white people that their lineage from historically is from Africa.

2576
02:26:37.050 --> 02:26:41.080
I'm sure. Well, I mean the Sephardic people that lived in northern Africa,

2577
02:26:41.081 --> 02:26:44.770
right? Yeah. Where it's considered more Middle East. Right, right, right.

2578
02:26:44.771 --> 02:26:47.510
You can see some of that. Absolutely. But these people aren't,

2579
02:26:47.550 --> 02:26:51.430
the African people come from Turkey. Right, right.

2580
02:26:51.580 --> 02:26:53.650
Come from Kiev, Russia, you know,

2581
02:26:53.800 --> 02:26:56.860
that's where they come from and they migrated into Africa.

2582
02:26:57.010 --> 02:26:58.060
That's not where they from.

2583
02:26:58.690 --> 02:27:03.190
Their bodies aren't even biologically conducive to that environment.

2584
02:27:04.040 --> 02:27:04.420
You know,

2585
02:27:04.420 --> 02:27:09.160
I'm not conducive to the New York environment wife who is exactly,

2586
02:27:09.310 --> 02:27:12.100
but white folks is running down the street when shorts and I'm just like, Yo,

2587
02:27:12.101 --> 02:27:12.934
I need a jacket.

2588
02:27:13.810 --> 02:27:17.380
There's definitely a biological difference that we got to recognize where we

2589
02:27:17.381 --> 02:27:21.520
came from. Yeah. You know? Um, yeah.

2590
02:27:22.340 --> 02:27:25.740
I don't know. It's, it's a lot to this conversation. There's a,

2591
02:27:25.800 --> 02:27:28.120
it is a lot to this conversation, but it's so heavily weighted.

2592
02:27:28.121 --> 02:27:31.090
People don't want to be objective about it. Right. What's up?

2593
02:27:31.270 --> 02:27:35.920
<v 4>The thing I found about the Egyptians in Ohio was actually from a paper that was</v>

2594
02:27:35.921 --> 02:27:37.320
written. It's, it's postulating, it,

2595
02:27:37.321 --> 02:27:38.890
I guess they took a lot of the evidence that had,

2596
02:27:38.920 --> 02:27:42.190
they had been finding and saying this shows that there might have actually been

2597
02:27:42.191 --> 02:27:46.060
Egyptians there from 1937 that's when the guy was, I think born,

2598
02:27:46.061 --> 02:27:49.990
this is 40 years ago that I emulate was brass apparently.

2599
02:27:49.991 --> 02:27:53.500
And it was found near Cincinnati and where I actually think it might've been

2600
02:27:53.501 --> 02:27:57.790
trading trade routes cause there was some like a stones that had been found in

2601
02:27:57.791 --> 02:28:01.090
various parts of the world that are from specifically Ohio because it's like a

2602
02:28:01.091 --> 02:28:04.780
rainbow shale that was using like arrowheads and stuff a long, long time ago.

2603
02:28:05.140 --> 02:28:08.410
That area was used to make weapons like the first,

2604
02:28:08.620 --> 02:28:11.740
like 12,000 years ago in the first people were kind of in North America.

2605
02:28:12.190 --> 02:28:15.850
But that area in Ohio also is known as the stand stone capital of the world.

2606
02:28:15.851 --> 02:28:18.490
And I don't know if that's related to the Egyptians cause that's what the

2607
02:28:18.491 --> 02:28:19.570
pyramids are made out of. You know,

2608
02:28:20.170 --> 02:28:23.240
there's tons of sandstone that is very specific to that region.

2609
02:28:24.130 --> 02:28:27.560
So pyramids made a sandstone. I thought so, yeah.

2610
02:28:27.890 --> 02:28:32.890
There's 21 from 1800 to 1980 21 times.

2611
02:28:33.081 --> 02:28:36.830
The amount of sandstone that made the great pyramid was shipped out of Ohio to

2612
02:28:36.831 --> 02:28:40.400
make various buildings all over the world. Most of them United States obviously,

2613
02:28:40.401 --> 02:28:41.420
but all over the place.

2614
02:28:42.150 --> 02:28:42.830
<v 0>Don't, don't,</v>

2615
02:28:42.830 --> 02:28:45.500
don't just weird facts I found at the grand jury through the human,

2616
02:28:45.920 --> 02:28:46.790
<v 2>no history.</v>

2617
02:28:47.240 --> 02:28:51.470
We know some are only the only history that we know is the one we go discover on

2618
02:28:51.471 --> 02:28:56.240
our own time. The one that's presented to us is not history. It's all lies.

2619
02:28:57.150 --> 02:28:59.930
<v 4>Well, it's not all lie. All love is some lie.</v>

2620
02:28:59.931 --> 02:29:04.250
I found that to lost civilization and Grand Canyon was wait Egyptian and the

2621
02:29:04.251 --> 02:29:08.240
Smithsonian published some stuff in 1999 now I guess that where all this came

2622
02:29:08.241 --> 02:29:08.481
from,

2623
02:29:08.481 --> 02:29:13.481
there was a article that got written and I don't know how much of it they proved

2624
02:29:13.551 --> 02:29:18.120
or proven or it was just newspaper Bait back.

2625
02:29:18.530 --> 02:29:18.920
<v 0>They listen.</v>

2626
02:29:18.920 --> 02:29:22.790
The more amazing the artifacts didn't match up to anything on the known record

2627
02:29:22.791 --> 02:29:26.900
rather than appearing to be of native American origin as one might expect.

2628
02:29:26.901 --> 02:29:30.980
The object had distinct Egyptian or Tibetan designs.

2629
02:29:31.760 --> 02:29:35.630
Could there have been an entire civilization of Egyptians living here? If so,

2630
02:29:35.631 --> 02:29:40.520
how do they get here? Dunk Dunk, hop in the boat,

2631
02:29:40.521 --> 02:29:41.210
man.

2632
02:29:41.210 --> 02:29:46.150
You got cats that leave Africa and try to come to spay and all these places or a

2633
02:29:46.160 --> 02:29:50.840
chicken wing. Yeah. It is interesting,

2634
02:29:50.841 --> 02:29:51.171
right?

2635
02:29:51.171 --> 02:29:55.070
Like the population of Cuba Cuba's so insanely diverse and it's right there.

2636
02:29:55.340 --> 02:29:58.070
Like what is the history of that other than the slave routes?

2637
02:29:58.071 --> 02:30:01.730
Like what is the history of Cuba? Because Cuba is very distinct.

2638
02:30:01.731 --> 02:30:03.110
African people live in there,

2639
02:30:04.230 --> 02:30:07.970
<v 2>the whole Caribbean, all that whole area is, uh,</v>

2640
02:30:08.010 --> 02:30:10.330
has a lot of African roots to it. Um,

2641
02:30:10.380 --> 02:30:13.590
but that's just a place that was conquered by to Spain, you know, by,

2642
02:30:13.591 --> 02:30:17.460
by the Cortez's, you know, those type of people. Um,

2643
02:30:18.290 --> 02:30:22.160
<v 0>but what really disturbs me is there's no way to know exactly what happened.</v>

2644
02:30:22.550 --> 02:30:26.540
It's like you're piecing things together based on artifacts and historical

2645
02:30:26.541 --> 02:30:29.820
record things that people wrote down and journals and logs. And

2646
02:30:30.720 --> 02:30:34.110
<v 2>yes, there's people that have traveled. So, again,</v>

2647
02:30:34.140 --> 02:30:35.340
I've studied this so long ago,

2648
02:30:35.341 --> 02:30:40.341
but I remember reading primary source from somebody that travel with Crystal

2649
02:30:40.800 --> 02:30:42.630
Ball, Cologne, Aka Christopher Columbus.

2650
02:30:43.110 --> 02:30:47.340
And he was saying very specific things about his accounts when he reached these

2651
02:30:47.341 --> 02:30:50.520
different places and you know, and he was saying things like,

2652
02:30:50.610 --> 02:30:53.610
we got to the land and we found Africans and he,

2653
02:30:53.611 --> 02:30:57.660
I remember him specifically saying, uh, so no matter where we go,

2654
02:30:57.661 --> 02:31:00.630
we find Africans. And he said it as if he was disappointed.

2655
02:31:01.080 --> 02:31:03.870
And then he started talking about like, you know, this is,

2656
02:31:03.940 --> 02:31:06.450
they started talking about the culture and describing their culture.

2657
02:31:06.960 --> 02:31:10.440
You just gotta go look at the people that travel with crystal ball Cologne,

2658
02:31:10.470 --> 02:31:14.010
and there's some firsthand accounts there and they're very honest about it,

2659
02:31:14.100 --> 02:31:14.933
you know,

2660
02:31:15.190 --> 02:31:17.560
<v 0>shoot, I'm going to look into that now. That's a very interesting,</v>

2661
02:31:17.561 --> 02:31:19.740
I'm going to ask Graham about that too. What knows about it?

2662
02:31:20.670 --> 02:31:25.560
<v 3>He's studied a me, especially on his latest book. He studied a lot about,</v>

2663
02:31:26.510 --> 02:31:30.870
uh, the de various cultures that made it to North America and South America.

2664
02:31:31.050 --> 02:31:34.930
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. This is very rich in history. Very, very rich answer.

2665
02:31:35.520 --> 02:31:38.100
I gotta wrap this up, but, uh, thanks for coming, man.

2666
02:31:38.101 --> 02:31:40.530
I had a great time talking to you. Uh, tell everybody it's,

2667
02:31:41.160 --> 02:31:45.240
I'm vibe high on h I on Twitter.

2668
02:31:45.570 --> 02:31:49.590
No more Instagram. No Instagram. Don't you show your youtube show?

2669
02:31:49.770 --> 02:31:54.190
Hoteps been told you every Thursday, 8:00 PM. It's a great name. Alright.
