those aren't those are cliches obviously
and so they lack power because they're

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960
and so they lack power because they're
 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.700
and so they lack power because they're
cliches but you can take them apart and

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:15.710

being a cliche and you do that by being

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330
being a cliche and you do that by being

being a cliche and you do that by being
more humble about them I would say

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220
more humble about them I would say
 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.189
more humble about them I would say
because maybe you can't tell the truth

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199
because maybe you can't tell the truth
 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.509
because maybe you can't tell the truth
because you don't know what the truth is

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519
because you don't know what the truth is
 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.790
because you don't know what the truth is
but one thing you can do is you can stop

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800
but one thing you can do is you can stop
 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.140
but one thing you can do is you can stop
saying things that you know to be untrue

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150
saying things that you know to be untrue
 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.299
saying things that you know to be untrue
and you might say well how do I know

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309
and you might say well how do I know
 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.280
and you might say well how do I know
that they're untrue and the answer to

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290
that they're untrue and the answer to
 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.410
that they're untrue and the answer to
that is well you need a whole philosophy

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420
that is well you need a whole philosophy
 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.209
that is well you need a whole philosophy
of truth the elaboration of an entire

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219
of truth the elaboration of an entire
 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.590
of truth the elaboration of an entire
philosophy of truth to answer that

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600
philosophy of truth to answer that
 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.910
philosophy of truth to answer that
question and so we're not going to

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920
question and so we're not going to
 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.470
question and so we're not going to
bother answering that question because

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480
bother answering that question because
 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.180
bother answering that question because
in some sense at the moment it's beside

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190
in some sense at the moment it's beside
 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.279
in some sense at the moment it's beside
the point that isn't the issue the issue

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289
the point that isn't the issue the issue
 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.170
the point that isn't the issue the issue
is there are times in your life where

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180
is there are times in your life where
 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.369
is there are times in your life where
you know that the thing that you're

saying is not true it's a deception it's
 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.779
saying is not true it's a deception it's
a lie of some sort and you're using it

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789
a lie of some sort and you're using it
 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.270
a lie of some sort and you're using it
to manipulate yourself or another person

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280
to manipulate yourself or another person
 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.310
to manipulate yourself or another person
or the world and you're also possessed

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320
or the world and you're also possessed
 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.080
or the world and you're also possessed
fully possessed of the idea that you can

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090
fully possessed of the idea that you can
 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.000
fully possessed of the idea that you can
get away with it and there's a satanic

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010
get away with it and there's a satanic
 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.369
get away with it and there's a satanic
arrogance about that in fact that is the

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379
arrogance about that in fact that is the
 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.980
arrogance about that in fact that is the
archetypal arrogance that's portrayed in

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990
archetypal arrogance that's portrayed in
 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.750
archetypal arrogance that's portrayed in
the mythological character of Satan

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760
the mythological character of Satan
 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.810
the mythological character of Satan
because Satan is precisely the archetype

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820
because Satan is precisely the archetype
 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.600
because Satan is precisely the archetype
of the element of the mind that believes

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610
of the element of the mind that believes
 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.469
of the element of the mind that believes
that it can twist and and bend the

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479
that it can twist and and bend the
 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.179
that it can twist and and bend the
structure of reality without paying the

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189
structure of reality without paying the
 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.039
structure of reality without paying the
price for that and you can't imagine

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049
price for that and you can't imagine
 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.630
price for that and you can't imagine
anything that's more arrogant than that

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640
anything that's more arrogant than that
 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.700
anything that's more arrogant than that
because really do you really think that

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710
because really do you really think that
 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.770
because really do you really think that
you can twist the structure of a reality

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780
you can twist the structure of a reality
 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.810
you can twist the structure of a reality
and that that's going to work out for

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820
and that that's going to work out for
 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.609
and that that's going to work out for
you without it snapping back it's so

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619
you without it snapping back it's so
 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.890
you without it snapping back it's so
obvious that that can't work that that

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900
obvious that that can't work that that
 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.990
obvious that that can't work that that
everyone knows it but anyways back to

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000
everyone knows it but anyways back to
 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.410
everyone knows it but anyways back to

same time everything will degenerate
into something that's indistinguishable

the warning in the flood story is don't

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959
the warning in the flood story is don't
 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.750
the warning in the flood story is don't
do that for very long because things

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760
do that for very long because things
 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.490
do that for very long because things
will happen that are so awful you cannot

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500
will happen that are so awful you cannot
 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.650
will happen that are so awful you cannot
possibly imagine it and that'll happen

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660
possibly imagine it and that'll happen
 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.210
possibly imagine it and that'll happen
to you personally it'll happen to your

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220
to you personally it'll happen to your
 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.680
to you personally it'll happen to your
family it'll happen to your community

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690
family it'll happen to your community
 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.120
family it'll happen to your community
and it's happened to people over and

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130
and it's happened to people over and
 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.770
and it's happened to people over and
over throughout history and it's it's

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780
over throughout history and it's it's
 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.180
over throughout history and it's it's
quite interesting you know it's it's

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190
quite interesting you know it's it's
 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.130
quite interesting you know it's it's
very soon after the story of Cain and

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140
very soon after the story of Cain and
 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.160
very soon after the story of Cain and
Abel when you see evil enter the world

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170
Abel when you see evil enter the world
 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.650
Abel when you see evil enter the world
in the story of Adam and Eve along with

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660
in the story of Adam and Eve along with
 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.600
in the story of Adam and Eve along with
self-consciousness and evil there is the

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610
self-consciousness and evil there is the
 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.790
self-consciousness and evil there is the
the ability that's the knowledge of good

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800
the ability that's the knowledge of good
 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.530
the ability that's the knowledge of good
and evil that's the ability to hurt

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540
and evil that's the ability to hurt
 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.750
and evil that's the ability to hurt
other people self-consciously to know

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760
other people self-consciously to know
 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.220
other people self-consciously to know
what you're doing and then of course

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230
what you're doing and then of course
 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.020
what you're doing and then of course
instantly Cain takes that to the

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030
instantly Cain takes that to the
 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.550
instantly Cain takes that to the
absolute extreme and he uses that

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560
absolute extreme and he uses that
 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.890
absolute extreme and he uses that
capacity to to destroy

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900
capacity to to destroy
 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.500
capacity to to destroy
really what he loves best he gets as

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510
really what he loves best he gets as
 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.500
really what he loves best he gets as
close as a human being can to destroying

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510
close as a human being can to destroying
 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.240
close as a human being can to destroying
the divine ideal because of course his

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250
the divine ideal because of course his
 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.099
the divine ideal because of course his
brother is Abel and Abel is favored by

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109
brother is Abel and Abel is favored by
 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.710
brother is Abel and Abel is favored by
God and Cain destroys him which Cain

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720
God and Cain destroys him which Cain
 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.510
God and Cain destroys him which Cain
tells God at the end of that episode

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520
tells God at the end of that episode
 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.550
tells God at the end of that episode
that his punishment is more than he can

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560
that his punishment is more than he can
 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.050
that his punishment is more than he can
bear and I think the reason for that is

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060
bear and I think the reason for that is
 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.730
bear and I think the reason for that is
where are you one

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740
where are you one
 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.159
where are you one
so you destroy your own ideal what's

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169
so you destroy your own ideal what's
 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:31.330
so you destroy your own ideal what's
left for you

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340
left for you
 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.540
left for you
there's nowhere to go there's no up and

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550
there's nowhere to go there's no up and
 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.999
there's nowhere to go there's no up and
when there's no up there's a lot of down

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:37.009
when there's no up there's a lot of down
 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:39.189
when there's no up there's a lot of down
and you know there's an idea that was

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199
and you know there's an idea that was
 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:41.189
and you know there's an idea that was
put forth very nicely in Milton's

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199
put forth very nicely in Milton's
 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:43.830
put forth very nicely in Milton's
Paradise Lost when he was describing

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840
Paradise Lost when he was describing
 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.050
Paradise Lost when he was describing
from a psychological perspective

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060
from a psychological perspective
 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.279
from a psychological perspective
essentially what hell is and hell is

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:50.289
essentially what hell is and hell is
 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:52.600
essentially what hell is and hell is
you're in hell to the degree that you're

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610
you're in hell to the degree that you're
 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.180
you're in hell to the degree that you're
distant from the good that that might be

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190
distant from the good that that might be
 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.830
distant from the good that that might be
a good way of thinking about it and if

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840
a good way of thinking about it and if
 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.499
a good way of thinking about it and if
you destroy your own ideal which you do

00:04:59.499 --> 00:04:59.509
you destroy your own ideal which you do
 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:01.719
you destroy your own ideal which you do
with jealousy and resentment and and the

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:01.729
with jealousy and resentment and and the
 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:03.820
with jealousy and resentment and and the
desire to pull down people who you would

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830
desire to pull down people who you would
 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.640
desire to pull down people who you would
like to be let's say then you end up in

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650
like to be let's say then you end up in
 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.439
like to be let's say then you end up in
a situation that's indistinguishable

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:08.449
a situation that's indistinguishable
 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:10.629
a situation that's indistinguishable
from hell and and the way the story the

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639
from hell and and the way the story the
 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:12.999
from hell and and the way the story the
biblical story unfolds as well it's it's

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:13.009
biblical story unfolds as well it's it's
 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:16.659
biblical story unfolds as well it's it's
it's Cain and then it's the flood and so

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669
it's Cain and then it's the flood and so
 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:18.790
it's Cain and then it's the flood and so
Cain adopts this mode of being that's

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800
Cain adopts this mode of being that's
 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.070
Cain adopts this mode of being that's
antithetical to being itself at least a

antithetical to being itself at least a
 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.420
antithetical to being itself at least a
positive being itself he does it

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430
positive being itself he does it
 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.670
positive being itself he does it
voluntarily he does it knowing full well

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680
voluntarily he does it knowing full well
 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.520
voluntarily he does it knowing full well
what he's doing and the net consequence

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530
what he's doing and the net consequence
 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.409
what he's doing and the net consequence
of this that as it ripples through the

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419
of this that as it ripples through the
 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:32.080
of this that as it ripples through the
entire social structure is that God

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090
entire social structure is that God
 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.029
entire social structure is that God
stands back and says this whole thing is

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039
stands back and says this whole thing is
 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:35.469
stands back and says this whole thing is
got so bad the only thing we can do is

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:35.479
got so bad the only thing we can do is
 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:38.320
got so bad the only thing we can do is
is wipe it to the ground and that is

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330
is wipe it to the ground and that is
 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.379
is wipe it to the ground and that is
that is no joke that's exactly how

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:41.389
that is no joke that's exactly how
 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:43.480
that is no joke that's exactly how
things work and one of the things that's

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490
things work and one of the things that's
 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.219
things work and one of the things that's
extraordinarily terrifying about that

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:45.229
extraordinarily terrifying about that
 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:47.200
extraordinarily terrifying about that
sequence of stories and I believe this

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210
sequence of stories and I believe this
 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.749
sequence of stories and I believe this
to be true I think I realized this

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:49.759
to be true I think I realized this
 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:52.450
to be true I think I realized this
independently of any of the analysis

independently of any of the analysis

independently of any of the analysis
that I was doing of mythological stories

that I was doing of mythological stories
 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.899
that I was doing of mythological stories
because I looked at what happened in

00:05:55.899 --> 00:05:55.909
because I looked at what happened in
