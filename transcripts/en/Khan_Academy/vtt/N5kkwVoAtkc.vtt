00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.660
A bit of a classic implicit
differentiation problem

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:10.900
is the problem y is
equal to x to the x.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.810
And then to find out what
the derivative of y

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.350
is with respect to x.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.520
And people look at that, oh you
know, I don't have just a

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.800
constant exponent here, so I
can't just use the power

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.300
rules, how do you do it.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.090
And the trick here is really
just to take the natural log of

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.860
both sides of this equation.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.530
And this is going to build
up to what we're going to

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.460
do later in this video.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.530
So If you take the natural log
on both sides of this equation,

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.570
you get the natural log of y is
equal to the natural

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.880
log of x to the x.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.750
Now our power rules, or I guess
our natural log rules, say

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.550
look, if I'm taking the natural
log of something to the

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.730
something, this is equivalent
to, I can rewrite the natural

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.690
log of x to the x as being
equal to x times the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.550
natural log of x.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.380
So let me rewrite
everything again.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.910
If I take the natural log of
both sides of that equation, I

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.190
get the natural log of y is
equal to x times the

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.530
natural log of x.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.100
And now we can take the
derivative of both sides of

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.350
this with respect to x.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.640
So the derivative with respect
to x of that, and then

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.440
the derivative with
respect to x of that.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.710
Now we're going to apply a
little bit of the chain rule.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:25.520
So the chain rule.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.730
What's the derivative of
this with respect to x?

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.840
What's the derivative of
our inner expression

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.330
with respect to x?

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.390
It's a little implicit
differentiation, so it's dy

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.600
with respect to x times the
derivative of this whole

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.710
thing with respect to
this inner function.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.150
So the derivative of
natural log of x is 1/x.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.690
So the derivative of
natural log of y with

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.840
respect to y is 1/y.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.080
So times 1/y.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.450
And the derivative of this--
this is just the product rule,

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.740
and I'll arbitrarily switch
colors here-- is the derivative

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.610
of the first term, which is 1,
times the second term, so times

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.760
the natural log of x plus the
derivative of the second term,

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.550
which is 1/x times
the first term.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.380
So times x.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:23.280
And so we get dy/dx times 1/y
is equal to natural log of x

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.140
plus-- this just turns out to
be 1-- x divided by x, and

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.260
then you multiply both
sides of this by y.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.590
You get dy/dx is equal
to y times the natural

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.610
log of x plus 1.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.360
And if you don't like this y
sitting here, you could just

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.410
make the substitution.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.620
y is equal to x to the x.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.410
So you could say that the
derivative of y with respect to

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.890
x is equal to x to the x times
the natural log of x plus 1.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.950
And that's a fun problem, and
this is often kind of given as

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.810
a trick problem, or sometimes
even a bonus problem if people

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.180
don't know to take the natural
log of both sides of that.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.290
But I was given an even more
difficult problem, and

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.550
that's what we're going
to tackle in this.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.270
But it's good to see this
problem done first because it

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.900
gives us the basic tools.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.350
So the more difficult
problem we're going to

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.700
deal with is this one.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.610
Let me write it down.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:26.990
So the problem is y is equal
to x to the-- and here's the

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.640
twist-- x to the x to the x.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.700
And we want to find out dy/dx.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.310
We want to find out
the derivative of y

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.630
with respect to x.

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.300
So to solve this problem we
essentially use the same tools.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.320
We use the natural log to
essentially breakdown this

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.000
exponent and get it into
terms that we can deal with.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.780
So we can use the product rule.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.300
So let's take the natural log
of both sides of this equation

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.810
like we did last time.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.570
You get the natural log of y
is equal to the natural log

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.630
of x to the x to the x.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.910
And this is just the
exponent on this.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.820
So we can rewrite this as x to
the x times the natural log

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.260
times the natural log of x.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.200
So now our expression our
equation is simplified to the

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.770
natural log of y is equal to x
to the x times the

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.940
natural log of x.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.890
But we still have this
nasty x to the x here.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.600
We know no easy way to take the
derivative there, although I've

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.310
actually just shown you what
the derivative of this is, so

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.720
we could actually just
apply it right now.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.890
I was going to take the natural
log again and it would turn

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.250
into this big, messy, confusing
thing but I realized that

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.340
earlier in this video I
just solved for what the

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.230
derivative of x to the x is.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.660
It's this thing right here.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.390
It's this crazy
expression right here.

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.890
So we just have to remember
that and then apply and

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.620
then do our problem.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.350
So let's do our problem.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.480
And if we hadn't solved this
ahead of time, it was kind of

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.470
an unexpected benefit of doing
the simpler version of the

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.640
problem, you could just keep
taking the natural log of this,

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.930
but it'll just get a
little bit messier.

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.970
But since we already know what
the derivative of x to the

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.150
x is, let's just apply it.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.540
So we're going to take
the derivative of both

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:21.530
sides of the equation.

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:26.060
Derivative of this is equal
to the derivative of this.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.160
We'll ignore this for now.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.780
Derivative of this with respect
to x is the derivative of

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.700
the natural log of y
with respect to y.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.160
So that's 1/y times
the derivative of y

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.965
with respect to x.

00:05:38.965 --> 00:05:40.630
That's just the chain rule.

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.010
We learned that in
implicit differentiation.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:48.870
And so this is equal to the
derivative of the first term

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.760
times the second term, and I'm
going to write it out here just

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.280
because I don't want to skip
steps and confuse people.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.615
So this is equal to the
derivative with respect to x of

00:05:57.615 --> 00:06:03.370
x to the x times the natural
log of x plus the derivative

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.690
with respect to x of
the natural log of

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:11.040
x times x to the x.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.100
So let's focus on the right
hand side of this equation.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.980
What is the derivative of x
to the x with respect to x?

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.920
Well we just solved that
problem right here.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.730
It's x to the x natural
log of x plus 1.

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:30.040
So this piece right there--
I already forgot what it

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.720
was-- it was x to the x
natural log of x plus 1.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:41.130
That is x to the x times the
natural log of x plus 1.

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:42.810
And then we're going to
multiply that times

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:44.070
the natural log of x.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.560
And then we're going to add
that to, plus the derivative

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.910
of the natural log of x.

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:59.310
That's fairly straightforward,
that's 1/x times x to the x.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:05.690
And of course the left
hand side of the equation

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:10.432
was just 1/y dy/dx.

00:07:10.432 --> 00:07:14.740
And we can multiply both sides
of this now by y, and we get

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:22.470
dy/dx is equal to y times all
of this crazy stuff-- x to the

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:27.840
x times the natural log of x
plus 1 times the natural log of

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:34.520
x plus 1/x times x to the x.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.000
That's x to the negative 1.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.890
We could rewrite this as x
to the minus 1, and then

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:39.750
you add the exponents.

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:44.650
You could write this as x
to the x minus 1 power.

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:48.640
And if we don't like this
y here, we can just

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.890
substitute it back.

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:53.440
y was equal to this, this
crazy thing right there.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:59.110
So our final answer for this
seemingly-- well on one level

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:01.120
looks like a very simple
problem, but on another level

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.220
when you appreciate what it's
saying, it's like oh there's a

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:07.480
very complicated problem-- you
get the derivative of y with

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.370
respect to x is equal
to y, which is this.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:21.480
So that's x to the x to the x
times all of this stuff-- times

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:27.580
x to the x natural log of x
plus 1 times the natural log

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:34.080
of x, and then all of that
plus x to the x minus 1.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:34.940
So who would have thought.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:36.460
Sometimes math is elegant.

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:37.870
You take the derivative of
something like this and

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:39.080
you get something neat.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.320
For example, when you take
the derivative of natural

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.774
log of x you get 1/x.

00:08:43.774 --> 00:08:46.340
That's very simple and elegant,
and it's nice that math

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:47.030
worked out that way.

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:50.130
But sometimes you do something,
you take an operation on

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:52.070
something that looks pretty
simple and elegant, and you get

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:55.420
something that's hairy and not
that pleasant to look

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:59.800
at, but is a pretty
interesting problem.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:00.080
And there you go.
