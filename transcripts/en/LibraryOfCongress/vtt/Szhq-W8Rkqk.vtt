00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.570
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.340
and welcome to the
Library of Congress.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.350
My name is Nicholas Brown,
and I work in the Office

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.580
of Special Events
and Public Programs.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.060
On behalf of the
librarians' office,

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.410
thank you for being here.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.590
We are working tonight with our
colleagues in the Law Library

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.610
of Congress and also in
the European division

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.810
to commemorate the 500th
anniversary of the Reformation.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.460
The Library has an ongoing
display entitled Martin Luther

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.040
as Priest, Heretic, and
Outlaw: The Reformation at 500,

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.130
which is on display in the
Thomas Jefferson Building

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.220
through January 1st, and
today, we are very privileged

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.970
to have Brad Gregory with us.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.790
He is a professor at the
University of Notre Dame,

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.630
and he is the author of Rebel in
the Ranks, which is right here,

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.300
and he's going to be lecturing

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.000
and discussing Martin Luther's
legacy and also the legacy

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.150
of the Reformation on culture

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.440
since this all took
place 500 years ago.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.340
Professor Gregory is the
author of multiple books,

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.230
including Salvation at
Stake: Christian Martyrdom

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.660
in Early Modern Europe, and
also The Unintended Reformation:

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.080
How a Religious Revolution
Secularized Society.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.350
He's one of the leading
scholars on the Reformation

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.490
and also religion of that
period in the United States,

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.910
so it's a great honor
to have him here with us

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.590
at the Library of
Congress tonight.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.250
A few housekeeping
notes to share

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.760
with you about the evening.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.800
The discussion will be about
45 minutes, plus Q and A

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.910
in this room, at which
point you'll be invited

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.680
to view a very special treasures
display from the Law Library

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.560
of Congress, which my colleague
Margaret Wood will discuss

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.860
in a few moments.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.120
This was curated by Nathan Dorn,
who is the rare books curator

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.800
for the Law Library's
collections.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.710
You can check out the
Law Library's resources

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.270
and collections online
at loc.gov/law.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.810
We also invite you to live tweet
at any time during this event

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.910
in order to help us promote the
fact that the Library is, one,

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.710
having free lectures, which
is really great, and also,

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.340
to share your impressions of
Professor Gregory's discussion,

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.190
and we're using the
hashtag Reformation500.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.890
Also, at the conclusion
of the talk,

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.190
you will have the opportunity

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.960
to get a book signed
if you so choose.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.210
The Library's gift shop has
generously joined us this

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.580
evening to offer books on
sale at a discounted rate

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.140
of 22 dollars, and Professor
Gregory will be available

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.210
to sign at the conclusion of the
program, and then if you would

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.010
like to see the display that
is upstairs, the Martin Luther

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.230
as Priest, Heretic, and Outlaw
display, we'll gather as a group

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.700
and go together whenever
you're ready, because it's

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.590
in a closed portion of the
building, so we're going to have

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.760
to go there en masse and
be guided, so that's going

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.900
to be exciting, and you
can also see the oldest map

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.520
of the United States printed in
the United States and created

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.030
by a United States citizen from
1784, which is kind of cool.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.870
Without further ado,
I'm going to welcome

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.740
up my colleague Margaret,

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.470
who will give us a brief
introduction to the rare books

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.770
over here, and then we'll turn
it over to Professor Gregory.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.070
Thank you.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.790
&gt;&gt; Margaret Wood:
Thank you, Nicholas.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:30.800
I'm Margaret Wood, and I'm
a public services library

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.210
with the Law Library
of Congress.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.070
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: We need you on
the microphone so we can hear.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.370
Sorry.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:38.670
&gt;&gt; Margaret Wood: Oh, sorry.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.970
Okay.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.270
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Thanks

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:42.570
&gt;&gt; Margaret Wood:
Good to meet you.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:43.870
All right, I hate not to be
able to point to the books.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.170
I am a public services librarian

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.570
with the Law Library
of Congress.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:53.220
My colleague Nathan Dorn,
who is the rare book curator,

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.830
went ahead and put together
the exhibit for this evening.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:03.220
It includes a number
of beautiful items

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.720
and also very interesting items

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.810
from the Law Library's
rare book collection.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.860
It begins in 1502
with Pope Leo's bull,

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.980
which says to Martin
Luther "recant,"

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.670
which apparently
doesn't work out.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:24.870
In 1521, as I understand it,
Martin Luther burned some

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.920
of his canon law books
as a symbolic protest,

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.810
and we have a beautiful
early 16th century collection

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.420
of canon law in recognition
of that event.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.750
Following that, there are
several texts that were written

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.440
by evangelicals, some who may

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.230
or may not have had
a legal background,

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.200
but they were going ahead
and reworking criminal law,

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.160
family law, and municipal law.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.930
One of my favorites in that
area is actually a lovely,

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.970
very short 1534 religious law
book that was put together

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.670
for the Duke of Wartenburg.

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:06.440
Then we've got Henry the
8th's 1534 "begone, pope."

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:12.050
He gets rid of Peter's pence
and therefore cuts off money,

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.960
and the end of the exhibit
are actually three items

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.050
from the United States.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.240
The first is 1630.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.710
It's John Cotton's
draft for the laws

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.740
of Massachusetts Bay colony,
based on the penitook.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.640
They were not adopted, but
New Hampshire looks to them,

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:39.950
and then we have William
Penn's charter and a copy

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.550
of the 1786 Virginia
Thomas Jefferson Law

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:44.850
and Religious Freedom.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.560
I invite you to look
at these items.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.400
You may take photographs as
long as there's no flash,

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:54.800
and if you'd like me to turn the
pages after, please feel free,

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.610
and any questions about
rare book material

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.550
in the Law Library, you
can just, as Nicholas said,

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.070
go to our website,
contact the library,

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.600
and we can put you
in touch with Nathan.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.900
Thank you.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.200
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Professor
Greg, yeah.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.500
&gt;&gt; Brad Gregory: Okay.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.800
Thank you very much.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.100
Quite a difference in height
between Margaret and myself,

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.400
so they'll adjust
the height here.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.880
Thanks very much, Nicholas,
for the introduction before.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.100
Thanks to all of you
for coming this evening.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.230
It's wonderful to see you here.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:28.680
It's a great honor for me to
be in our nation's capital

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.070
and at the Library of Congress
delivering this lecture in honor

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:37.380
of and commemorating the 500th
anniversary of the Reformation

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:42.140
as part of the ongoing series of
lectures and other events here

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:46.060
at the Library of Congress
under the rubric The Reformation

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:51.070
at 500, and please, if
you're going to live tweet,

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:53.190
only positive comments,
please, and thank you very much.

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:56.890
Okay. My talk this evening
is going to make an argument

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:58.190
with two main components.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.420
First, the Reformation
was not only important

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.310
in the 16th century,
but remained essential

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:09.020
for understanding our world
today, regardless of whether

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:13.550
or not you're a Protestant
or even a religious believer,

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:17.960
and secondly, the Reformation's
influence today is by

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.230
and large indirect and
the opposite of what any

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:24.540
of the major reformers
of the 16th century,

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:28.720
including Martin Luther,
wanted their reform

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.280
of western Christendom to
achieve, for the long-term,

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:37.290
unintended, and yet
undeniable overriding outcome

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:40.860
of the Reformation has
been the secularization

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.630
of western society.

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:47.740
Western modernity, in its
dominant institutions, ideas,

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:52.630
values, and practices,
including in the United States,

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:55.660
is not an outgrowth of
the Reformation in any

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:59.090
of its 16th century expressions.

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:03.330
It's rather a reaction
against the Reformation era

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.730
and the way it's
doctrinal disagreements

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:12.240
and its concrete conflicts made
Christianity into a problem

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.750
to which modernity has
been the response in ways

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:20.260
that have fostered
secularization.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.390
My talk this evening
gives a glimpse

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:28.200
of the book that's rather
shamelessly displayed on

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:33.160
and off here on both sides
of me, Rebel in the Ranks:

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:37.900
Martin Luther, the
Reformation, and the Conflicts

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.730
that Continue to
Shape our World.

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:45.040
My argument concerns the
historical consequences

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:48.140
of the Reformation
era, not which, if any,

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:54.000
among the Christian traditions
that emerged from it is true

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.010
or mistaken, right or
wrong, the criteria

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:00.760
for assessing these
issues, and so forth.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.800
I've structured my
talk as a play,

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:08.220
a play in four acts preceded
by a prelude which parallel --

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.550
what a coincidence -- the
four chapters of my book.

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:17.040
My talk, like my book, starts
small and expands outward

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.880
in its subject matter,
its time frames,

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.250
and its geographical range.

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:22.510
It moves from late
medieval Christianity

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.330
to one Augustinian friar, a
German movement, a European era,

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.630
and western modernity
as a whole.

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:26.930
So here we go.

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:28.230
Prelude. Christianity
as more than religion.

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:29.530
Today, religion is
your individual choice,

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:30.830
including the option not
to be religious at all.

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:32.130
It's considered a distinct
area of life among others,

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:33.430
separate from your career,
professional relationships,

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:34.730
recreational activities,
consumer behavior, and so on.

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:36.030
Neither of these things was
true in the early 16th century.

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:37.330
Leaving aside Europe's
tiny percentage of Jews,

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:38.630
religion was not a matter of
choice, nor was it separate

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:39.930
from the rest of life.

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:41.230
You became a Christian
through the taken for granted,

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:42.530
centuries-old ritual
of infant baptism,

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:43.830
and religion was not hived
off from the rest of life.

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:45.130
It didn't stand apart
from exercising power

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:46.430
or administering
justice, but was meant

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:47.730
to inform politics and law.

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:49.030
Christianity wasn't
segregated from buying

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:50.330
and selling goods
or pursuing profit.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:51.630
Its teachings sought

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:52.930
to circumscribe economic
transactions

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:54.230
and to restrain greed.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:55.530
Education was imbued
with Christian ideas,

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:56.830
from teaching ABCs in
humble primary schools

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:58.130
through instruction in one of
Europe's 60 or so universities.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:09:59.430
Social relationships and gender
expectations as well as public

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:00.730
and private morality were
conceived in Christian terms.

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:02.030
Faith was meant to influence not
only how Christians worshipped

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:03.330
and prayed, but also how
they ruled and worked,

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:04.630
bought and sold,
taught and learned, --

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:05.930
-- and understood their lives.

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:07.230
In short, religion
was about much more

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:09.370
than what we usually
mean by religion.

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:13.780
Now, none of this implies that
many people behaved like saints.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.240
Far from it.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.380
The Reformation sought
to address this problem,

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:20.590
although it wasn't its
leader's main concern.

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:22.400
Conscientious Christians
had been aware

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.690
of the problems long before
Martin Luther appeared

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:26.050
on the scene.

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:28.120
Sinful shortcomings in
the church and the lives

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:31.120
of its members, including
its clerical leaders,

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:34.830
affected everything else because
religion was so intertwined

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:36.410
with the rest of life.

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:38.500
For centuries before
the Reformation,

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:42.990
the gap between Christian ideals
and lived realities was lamented

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:46.910
by men and women who were
saintly and sought reforms,

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:49.360
say Bernard of Clairvaux
in the 12th century,

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:53.300
or Catherine of Siena
in the 14th.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.480
Without question, there
were perceived problems

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.510
in the late medieval church,
including the western schism,

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:01.780
conflicts over authority,
worldly renaissance popes

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:04.640
and cardinals, greedy
members of the clergy,

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.960
and ill-informed lay people,

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.930
so no wonder there
was a Reformation,

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:10.820
the traditional explanation
went,

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.460
considering papal decadence,

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.060
the church's corruption,
and lay superstition.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:19.030
Luther saved the day by
rediscovering the gospel.

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:21.850
Yet decades of scholarship
have corrected this picture

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:25.020
with massive evidence
about the vitality

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:28.200
of late medieval Christianity,
from lay bible reading

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.870
in the vernacular to the
voluntary lay support

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:33.190
of parish churches
and religious orders,

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:35.210
to enthusiastic lay
participation

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:38.090
in confraternities,
and much more.

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:41.620
In fact, more 15th century
Christians were probably more

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:44.420
self-consciously devout
than their predecessors

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.800
in any proceeding century.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.040
The Reformation emerged as much
out of religious commitment

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.000
as a reaction against the
church's shortcomings.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.160
Indeed, these two
things went together.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.910
People tend to want to reform
things that they care about.

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:02.820
Yet the fact that religion
wasn't something separate

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:05.670
from other areas of
life is more fundamental

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:08.720
for explaining the long-term
impact of the Reformation

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.220
and how our present contrasts

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:14.380
with its leaders most
basic objectives.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.480
It wasn't something you
could step away from

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.370
or decide you didn't
want to affect you.

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:22.360
You didn't have to be devout,
but you couldn't avoid living

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.270
in a Christian society.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:27.160
Religion was never
just about religion.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:31.320
It influenced everything
else, for better or worse,

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.450
so because religion was
connected to everything else,

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:38.020
changes in religion would
affect everything else,

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:40.560
and the Reformation
brought changes

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:44.390
in Latin Christianity unlike
anything else in the Middle Ages

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:47.180
in its geographical
scope, its staying power,

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:50.150
and its transformative
influence.

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:52.490
The Reformation affected
not only religion

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:56.130
but also everything related to
religion in the 16th century --

00:12:56.130 --> 00:13:00.120
in other words, just about
every area of human life.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.990
The Reformation would be the
reformation of everything.

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:05.430
This gets us a step closer

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:08.120
to why the Reformation
still matters today.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.690
Changes in religion
and disagreements

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:13.380
about Christianity
had consequences

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:16.360
that went far beyond religion
as we usually think about it,

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:20.460
and those changes and
those disagreements started

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:24.330
with an Augustinian friar and
university professor anxious

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:25.630
about his own salvation.

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:32.680
Act one, Martin Luther:
Reluctant Rebel.

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.610
Martin Luther is enormously
interesting in his own right,

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:37.560
and more has been
written about him

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:41.480
than any other single person
except Jesus of Nazareth,

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.920
but explaining why the
Reformation still matters

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.810
regardless of our own
beliefs doesn't depend

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:49.200
on whether we find
Luther fascinating,

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.250
like his theology,
or agree with him.

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:56.320
He matters historically because
of what he set in motion,

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.260
the basis on which he did so,

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:03.050
and how transformative
both have been.

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:06.110
Now I assume that many of you
are familiar with the basics

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:09.530
of Luther's remarkable story,
between the fall of 1517

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:13.500
and the spring of 1521, so I'm
only going to say a few things

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.820
about it this evening, and even
if you aren't familiar with it,

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:19.690
well, the remedy for that,
of course, is to buy my book,

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:23.490
Rebel in the Ranks, because
chapter one is all about that.

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:27.520
In October of 1517, almost
no one had even heard

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.930
of Martin Luther
outside of a few towns

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:33.130
and Augustinian friaries
in central Germany.

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:36.550
Three a half years later,
he had condemned the papacy,

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:40.300
defied the emperor, and become
Europe's most famous man,

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.600
as well as its most published
author since the invention

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.950
of the printing press
in the 1450s.

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:49.540
The Reformation is even more
astonishing because no one

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:52.740
in 1517 could have
anticipated it.

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:54.350
No one could have
guessed it would start

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:58.360
in a forgettable town of
about 2,000 people in Saxony,

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:01.260
and even less could anyone
have imagined that the actions

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:02.630
of an ultra-devout,

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:05.070
ultra-conscientious
university professor

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:06.740
and friar would be behind it.

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:10.670
If you'd asked those who knew
Luther what his future might

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:12.950
hold in the summer of 1517,

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:15.880
they probably would have
predicted a successful academic

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.710
career in the church.

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:20.380
Thousands of friars had
pursued such careers

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:22.430
since the 13th century,

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:25.210
when universities first
began to take hold.

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:27.650
They continued to
do so in the 1510s,

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:31.720
and Luther had made an
impressive start on the same.

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.580
Luther's career as an
Augustinian from 1506

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:37.790
to the summer of 1517
was marked by success,

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:42.090
with no observable signs
of opposition or rebellion.

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:44.040
On the contrary,
Luther was diligent

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.210
and obedient to a fault.

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:47.510
He was ordained a priest

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:50.420
and celebrated his
first mass in 1507.

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:52.940
He showed himself eager
for religious life,

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:55.720
spiritually intense,
intellectually gifted,

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.190
and interested in scripture.

00:15:58.190 --> 00:15:59.490
As far as could be observed,

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:02.250
he was a thriving Augustinian
professor of theology

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:05.720
in his early 30s, teaching
at a new university

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:10.020
in the provincial German
town of Wittenberg,

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:13.310
yet not all was as it seemed.

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:17.060
What really mattered in early
1517 remained as invisible

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:20.370
to almost everyone as
it had been for years.

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:24.230
Inside, Luther was
wracked with anxiety.

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.630
He was tormented nearly
to the point of despair

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:29.630
because of his life
as an Augustinian

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:31.650
and the exacting ways
in which he sought

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:34.480
to live up to its demands.

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.660
Luther's interior torments
were the religious roots

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:39.310
of the Reformation.

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:42.120
He wasn't a rebel seeking
to undermine the church,

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.520
nor did he aspire to
start one of his own.

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:48.000
The very notion would
have seemed absurd to him.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.250
Luther's own anxiety,
intense as it was,

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:53.920
wouldn't in itself have
produced the Reformation.

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:58.060
It began because Luther acted
on his anxiety in relationship

00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:01.390
to those who pushed
back against him.

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:04.150
Beginning in late 1517,
those who objected

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:05.470
to what Luther was saying

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:08.860
and how he was saying it
started a back and forth series

00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:12.460
of interactions through which
Luther's ideas became bolder

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:13.960
and clearer.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.720
Critically, those ideas
became widely known

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.420
through correspondence,
oral communication,

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:22.030
and especially through print.

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:24.790
The beginning of the Reformation
depended on publicity by

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:28.240
and resistance to Martin Luther.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:31.780
Through his reactions to that
resistance and his embrace

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:34.260
of the fame that seemed
to come out of nowhere,

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:37.540
he became a reluctant rebel.

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:42.460
I'm going to mention just a few
major stages in that process.

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:46.470
If the Ninety-Five Theses were
actually posted on the door

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:50.180
of Wittenberg's Castle Church
500 years ago, the event was

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:51.480
about as thrilling

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.500
as a professor today
posting an announcement

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:55.880
to the departmental
bulletin board.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.070
Seriously deflating, but true.

00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:00.700
But the printing
and the distribution

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:03.380
of the Ninety-Five Theses
was a difference maker,

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.580
as was the fact that Luther
sent them to Archbishop Albrecht

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:08.760
of Mainz, the most
powerful churchman

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.750
in the Holy Roman Empire.

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:13.980
Albrecht sent them on to
Rome, and in early 1518,

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:17.920
several fellow theologians
saw a connection in the theses

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.290
between Luther's criticism

00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:23.090
of indulgence preachers
and papal authority.

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:25.200
This was a crucial
bridge that would lead

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.370
through in-person confrontations
and dozens of back

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:32.570
and forth polemical pamphlets
to mutual condemnations.

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:36.630
Luther innovated by publicizing
controversial religious matters

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:40.830
in vernacular print,
starting in March of 1518.

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:43.130
He repeatedly said he
would retract any views

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:47.270
about which he could be shown to
his satisfaction to be mistaken,

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:50.210
and increasingly, this had
to be demonstrated to him

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:53.230
on the basis of scripture.

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:57.670
This insistence on God's word
gave Luther what he needed

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:00.240
to reject papal authority.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.380
For reasons that will
soon become clear,

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:05.950
this was his most consequential
move as a reformer,

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:07.880
the insistence on
scripture alone

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:11.520
as the self-sufficient basis
for Christian faith and life.

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.810
By the summer of
1520, a papal bull

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:16.510
of excommunication was
being prepared against him,

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:19.590
while he was writing and then
published the three hugely

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:22.620
influential treatises that
appeared later than year,

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.150
to the Christian Nobility
of the German Nation,

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:28.200
on the Babylonian Captivity
of the Church, right there.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.500
Oh, not now.

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.570
That's my book, but in three
seconds, it'll come up again,

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:33.790
that treatise, the title page.

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:35.090
There it is.

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:37.200
And the Freedom of a Christian.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.220
He responded to the
excommunication threat

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:43.680
by publicly burning the papal
bull and the church's canon law,

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:47.550
was excommunicated in
January of 1521, and in April,

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:50.600
refused to recant his views
in the iconic showdown

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:53.320
with Charles the Fifth
at the Diet of Worms.

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:54.860
"Hier stehe ich."

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:57.100
"Here I stand."

00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:59.160
Then Frederick of
Saxony's men took him

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.460
into protective hiding --

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:03.680
-- in the Wartburg Castle for
the better part of a year,

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:06.470
where among other things, he
drafted his own translation

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:08.990
of the New Testament
into German.

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:11.490
Amazing stuff.

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:13.250
The story is all
the more astonishing

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:15.730
because it was so unlikely.

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:19.320
There's no understanding
the Reformation without it,

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:23.310
but it is not the history
of the Reformation.

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:26.620
Luther started the Reformation
without intending to,

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:28.370
but it very quickly
became a movement

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:35.190
that escaped his control,
and so we move on to act two,

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:39.170
The Early German Reformation:
A Fractious Movement.

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:43.490
It would be more accurate to say
that Luther never had control

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:47.070
of the Reformation than to say
he had it and then lost it.

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:48.840
His insistence on
scripture alone

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.230
as the sole final
authority for Christian faith

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:54.230
and life cleared away
long-standing obstacles

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:58.280
to reform within the established
church by creating a principle

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:00.520
and a position outside it.

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.820
Eventually, those Christians

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:04.110
who rejected Rome would
be called Protestants,

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:07.750
a term coined first in 1529.

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:11.470
As the 1520s would show, it was
easier to denounce the church

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:15.950
as corrupt and unbiblical than
to agree on what God's word said

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:19.750
and how it should be applied,
and because Christianity shaped

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:23.220
and was intended to influence
every area of human life,

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:26.930
the implications were enormous.

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:29.270
What did proper Christian
worship, sacraments,

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:33.320
and ministry look like, and who
had the authority to say so?

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:36.110
What now was the right
relationship between the church

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:38.340
and political authorities?

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.890
Did the freedom of a Christian
extend to social, political,

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:43.210
and economic concerns?

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:45.440
How could you tell whether
someone had the right

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.850
understanding of the gospel

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:50.170
or was really inspired
by the Holy Spirt?

00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:54.020
Which prophecies about the
world's end were trustworthy?

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:56.700
The questions were
nearly endless.

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:59.240
So were the answers.

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:01.070
Those who rejected
Rome disagreed

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:05.860
about what God's word said and
so about what God's truth was,

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:08.230
so they disagreed about what
Christians should believe

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:09.770
and do.

00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:12.530
By the time Luther returned from
the Wartburg Castle in March

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:16.780
of 1522, Andreas Karlstadt
disputed his downgrading

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:19.790
of the Book of James and his
views about the Old Testament,

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:22.100
Eucharistic practice,
the oral confession

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:24.950
of sins, and religious images.

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:28.550
Luther and Philip Melanchthon
disagreed with Huldrych Zwingli

00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:31.030
and the latter's allies
about Christ's presence

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:34.090
in the Lord's Supper, a
dispute that inspired dozens

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:36.500
of hostile pamphlets
and culminated

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.500
in the dramatic face-to-face
non-resolution

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:42.710
of the Marburg Colloquy in 1529.

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:46.180
This became a crucial doctrinal
and thus also ecclesial

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:49.530
and social ground for the
distinction between Lutheranism

00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:51.950
and Reform Protestantism.

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:54.590
Zwingli disagreed also
with his former colleagues,

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:57.300
such as Balthasar
Hubmaier and Conrad Grebel,

00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:59.900
over the scriptural
basis for infant baptism,

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:03.350
with its enormous
ecclesiological implications.

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:07.280
This led to the origins of
Swiss Anabaptism by early 1525,

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:10.090
by which time the German
Peasants' War was raging,

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:13.460
with leaders such as Thomas
Muntzer completely rejecting

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:16.590
Luther's distinction between
the gospel on the one hand

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:20.200
and social, economic, and
political concerns on the other.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.340
Withdrawing from dreams
of remaking society

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:23.640
after the Peasants' War,

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:26.120
Anabaptists disagreed
among themselves in a host

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:30.250
of doctrinally and therefore
socially divisive ways,

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:32.990
beginning already
in the late 1520s,

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:36.950
and all these disputes are in
addition to the disagreements

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:39.590
and the divisions between
these Christians and those

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:41.750
who remained in the
Roman church.

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:46.650
The Reformation began with
the forceful figure of Luther,

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:50.540
but regarding the Reformation as
him and rival ideas ad movements

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:53.210
as deviations is
just really a way

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:57.100
of saying one prefers Luther's
position over the others.

00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.310
Many of his contemporaries
disagreed,

00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:02.210
as do their respective
religious heirs, Mennonites

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:05.000
or Presbyterians, for example.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.220
Luther's stance was based on his
principle about the authority

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:11.980
of scripture, ratified by
his persona experience.

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:15.460
Many others embraced the
principle, but rejected many

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:17.720
of Luther's claims
about God's word,

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:22.410
just as Luther rejected many of
the claims of the Roman church.

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:25.440
If everyone who rejected Rome
had agreed with Luther's claims

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.330
about the Bible,
not just the 1520s,

00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:32.060
but the entire Reformation era
and, indeed, the last 500 years

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:35.560
of western history would have
played out very differently.

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.240
That is not what
happened, starting already

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:41.210
in Wittenberg in 1521.

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:44.850
This fact and its many
unintended consequences,

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:47.560
as they unfolded in the
1520s and during the rest

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:50.340
of the 16th century and
beyond, are critical

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:51.890
for understanding
the Reformation

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:54.300
and why it still matters.

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:56.860
Luther alone is a sure recipe

00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:59.440
for misunderstanding
the Reformation,

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:02.480
however personally
inspiring the maxim might be

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:05.940
for those Christians who
love Luther's theology.

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:07.910
Already in the 1520s,

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:11.150
the Reformation radically
exceeded Luther's control

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:12.850
in ways that enraged him

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:17.450
and that reinforced his
apocalyptic expectations.

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:21.000
So the Reformation involved
disagreements among Protestants

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.700
no less than it predisposed
the reaction

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:25.900
of the Roman Catholic Church.

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.410
This started among evangelicals

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:31.060
in the 1520s and
never went away.

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:34.770
Instead of becoming a shared
basis for reforming the church,

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:38.890
the Bible became a battleground
among Protestants as well

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:41.590
as between Protestants
and Catholics.

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:44.260
The church became the churches.

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:46.160
This, too, has never gone away,

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.970
despite all the ecumenical
efforts and advances

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:51.660
of the past half-century.

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:55.440
The Reformation was not an
initially coherent movement

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.850
that only later fragmented.

00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:00.560
It prompted conflicting
claims about God's word

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:03.430
and God's will right
from the start.

00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:06.510
It spread like wildfire
in the early 1520s

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:09.690
through printed pamphlets,
and salacious woodcut images,

00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:11.980
and popular songs,
and word of mouth

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:14.580
in the Holy Roman
Empire and Switzerland.

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:18.110
In the mid-1520s, it inspired
mass uprisings across much

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:21.810
of central Europe in the
so-called German Peasants' War.

00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:25.420
Princes and their mercenary
armies put a swift end to that,

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:28.680
whether they were
supporters or enemies of Rome.

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:32.400
Wherever the Reformation
flourished after 1525,

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.940
it would be contained
by political authorities

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:38.770
and controlled under
their watchful eye.

00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:40.460
The decade after
the edict of Worms

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:44.330
in 1521 critically influenced
the subsequent history

00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:46.070
of Protestantism.

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:48.930
Basic patterns were
established that would endure,

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:52.350
and few were more important than
the difference between forms

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:56.220
of the Reformation that received
sustained political support

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:58.630
and forms that did not.

00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:02.320
A few words, then,
about each of these.

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:05.310
Two expressions of the
Reformation, Lutheranism

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:07.990
and reform Protestantism,
were backed by civic

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:10.010
or princely authorities.

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:12.150
Despite condemnation
from Charles the Fifth

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:14.960
and other Catholic leaders,
the patchwork character

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:18.880
of the Holy Roman Empire
enabled them to take root.

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:22.840
Starting in the 1520s, these
magisterial Protestants,

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:24.660
a term that refers to Lutherans

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:27.100
and reform Protestants
taken together,

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:29.910
began to create institutions,
forms of worship,

00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:33.580
statements of faith, and
new ways of being Christian.

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:34.880
These measures were implemented

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.830
by political authorities
working together with clergy,

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:40.540
many of them, at first,
former Catholic priests

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:42.840
from the new Protestant
churches.

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:46.500
They agreed with the medieval
view that subjects had

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:49.100
to share the same religious
beliefs and practices,

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:51.930
just many different
ones from Catholics.

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:53.230
To make religion a matter

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:56.610
of individual choice
invited conflict and loss

00:27:56.610 --> 00:27:59.920
of the shared basis for
life as a social, political,

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:02.440
and religious community.

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:05.370
All the other expressions
of the Reformation,

00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:09.360
of which there were many
more than two, were outlawed.

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.940
Their members were punished
by political authorities,

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:15.220
whether Lutheran, reform
Protestant, or Catholic.

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:19.470
Lacking political patronage,
these radical Protestants,

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:23.060
as they're collectively
known, were often persecuted,

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:26.830
so their numbers remained
small until centuries later,

00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:28.730
yet from the start,
they demonstrated

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:31.160
that God's word could
be and was understood

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.990
in many different
ways among those

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:36.440
who rejected the Roman
church, and they're essential

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:39.350
to understanding the
Reformation as a whole

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:42.270
and its abiding importance
down to the present.

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:45.440
They make clear the Reformation
cannot be reduced to Luther's

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:49.520
or any other reformer's
theology or biography.

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:56.090
Think of Martin Luther and the
unlikely events of 1517 to 1521

00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:59.490
like a stone plunked in a pond.

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:02.380
Then imagine the Reformation
in the 1520s and beyond

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:06.450
as ripples radiating outward
in all directions, everywhere,

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:09.400
disrupting the water's surface.

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.690
Those disruptions
were not restricted

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:15.470
to the Holy Roman Empire or
Switzerland, and so we move

00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:20.640
on to act three, but first,
I need a real drink of water.

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.690
Act three is entitled,

00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:32.600
"The Reformation
Defines a Troubled Era."

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.320
The spread of the Reformation
throughout Europe made it the

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:38.920
defining development of
an entire historical era,

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:43.110
not simply a German phenomenon
of regional significance.

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:46.910
Wherever it spread, rulers
had to decide how to respond,

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:48.710
like they had in
Germany and Switzerland

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:51.700
since the early 1520s,
including regions

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:54.260
where the Reformation
was harshly suppressed

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:58.070
and that remained strongly
Catholic, like Spain.

00:29:58.070 --> 00:30:00.040
If all rulers had chosen
for the Reformation --

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:02.930
-- and in the same form,

00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:05.940
the 16th century would
have been very different.

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:09.400
Instead, divergent
decisions led to divisions,

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.070
reflected disagreements,
and contributed to conflicts

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:13.790
that would prove
important to developments

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:16.310
that still influence us today.

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:18.220
Understanding the Reformation

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:21.740
and its long-term impact means
understanding the Reformation

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:24.880
era, including not only
the Protestant traditions

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:27.330
that formed but also
the relationships

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:29.670
between Protestants
and Catholics

00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:33.500
as well as among Protestants.

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:34.880
Political authorities that opted

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:38.160
for the Reformation determined
whose Protestantism got

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:42.090
supported and whose got
suppressed in the 1520s.

00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:45.820
The same was true throughout the
16th century and into the 17th.

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:48.630
Lutheranism and reform
Protestantism were the two forms

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:50.820
that survived and flourished.

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:54.980
Anglicanism -- I have
heard of it, just FYI.

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:58.820
Anglicanism is a particularly
case, and the term is not used

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:01.060
by scholars, at least
responsible scholars,

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:03.250
to describe the Protestantism
of the Church of England

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:07.350
until after 1660, so the period
of the Restoration later on,

00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:09.420
but I just want to
allay any concerns that,

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:12.680
"Why isn't this Reformation
expert mentioning Anglicanism?

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:15.220
It's like dude, there is
such a thing as Anglicanism."

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:16.520
I know it.

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:17.860
Okay. Moving on.

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:22.160
Starting in the 1530s,
magistrates in Geneva worked

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:24.120
with the refugee
reformer John Calvin

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:27.460
to make their French-speaking
Swiss city into a stronghold

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:29.820
for his version of
reformed Protestantism.

00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:33.390
It would have a major impact
in France, England, Scotland,

00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:35.600
and the Netherlands
as well as in parts

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:38.070
of Germany and eastern Europe.

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:41.200
All other expressions
besides Lutheranism

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:44.330
and reform Protestantism,
including those espoused

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:46.480
by all the different
Anabaptist groups,

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:50.080
spiritualist Protestants,
and other radical Protestant,

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.820
were usually outlawed.

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:55.220
Mostly these Christians
wanted just to be left alone,

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:59.050
at least before the
1640s in England.

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:01.960
Catholicism was no less
dependent on the choices

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:05.340
of rulers who decided to
oppose the Reformation.

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:08.650
They helped foster a major
re-energizing of Catholicism

00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:11.010
in the 16th century,
usually referred

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:15.720
to as the Catholic Reformation
or the Counter-Reformation.

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.020
Reforming efforts underway

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:19.760
in Christendom before
1517 were expanded

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.910
and new ones were taken up.

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:24.060
A major meeting of
Catholic church leaders,

00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:27.100
the Council of Trent,
convened on and off three times

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:31.250
between 1545 and 1563.

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:33.660
The Reformation era was
thus marked by the renewal

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:36.630
of Roman Catholicism no
less than by the creation

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:41.320
of magisterial and radical
Protestant traditions.

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:42.620
Magisterial Protestants

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:47.370
and Catholics undertook some
initiatives in parallel tracks.

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:49.130
In other ways, they were locked

00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:52.560
in competitive opposition
and mutual hostility.

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.420
Both of these are key

00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:56.890
for understanding the
Reformation era's influences

00:32:56.890 --> 00:33:02.060
down to the present, so I'll
say a bit about each one.

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:04.700
Whether Lutheran, reform
Protestant, or Catholic,

00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:06.790
political authorities
and clergy sought

00:33:06.790 --> 00:33:09.920
to channel constructive
creative religious commitments

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:11.530
into action.

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:15.200
Well-trained clergy preached
sermons and taught catechisms,

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:19.080
reconciled feuds and encouraged
devotion, praised piety

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:21.960
and excoriated sin,
consoled the grieving

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:23.890
and comforted the dying.

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:26.880
They were all trying to create
well-informed communities

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.550
of dedicated lay Lutherans,
reform Protestants,

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:32.560
or Catholics, respectively.

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:35.560
This wasn't a smooth or uniform
process, and they didn't succeed

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:39.130
across the board or as
well as they wanted to,

00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:40.480
yet the net result was

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:43.980
that European countries forged
the dominant state-supported

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:47.320
religious identities of their
subjects in the Reformation era

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.960
and carried them into
the modern world.

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:53.000
Lutheran Denmark, Sweden,
and much of Germany;

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.330
reform Protestant
Scotland, England, sort of,

00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:59.930
the Netherlands, and parts of
Switzerland; Catholic Spain,

00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:04.270
Italy, France, Austria,
Ireland, Poland, Belgium,

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:07.340
and parts of Germany
and Switzerland.

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:10.350
Not all the laity
appreciated these efforts.

00:34:10.350 --> 00:34:12.980
Some complied, but resented
conscientious clergy

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:15.250
as obnoxious and intrusive.

00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:17.690
Others rolled their
eyes, dragged their feet,

00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:20.900
and did as little as
they could get away with,

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:23.020
not that that has anything
to do with anybody who sat

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:25.920
through a bad Sunday
school class in their life.

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.610
Still others dissented

00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:30.630
and pursued radical
Protestant alternatives.

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:32.770
This resentment, as a byproduct

00:34:32.770 --> 00:34:35.560
of sometimes heavy-handed
methods of indoctrination

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:37.580
and attempts to control
lay behavior,

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:39.790
would have repercussions.

00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:41.850
It would eventually
help inspire initiatives

00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:44.900
of liberation very
different from those of Luther

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:47.850
or other early evangelicals.

00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:50.110
These parallel efforts
to create communities

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:53.970
of well-informed Christians
coexisted with disagreements

00:34:53.970 --> 00:34:56.750
about God's truth and
concrete hostilities

00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:59.410
between rival Christian regimes.

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:02.220
The Reformation made the
religion at Christendom's heart

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:05.710
into a series of major
problems because religion was

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:08.440
so interconnected
with the rest of life.

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:10.300
As in the Middle
Ages, it was assumed

00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:14.740
that religion should shape
politics and society no less

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:17.340
than worship and piety.

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:19.710
The period's doctrinal
controversies began

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:23.680
with Luther's first criticisms
of many Catholic teachings.

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:27.380
They also ripped apart the
early evangelical movement.

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:29.740
They continued and
were institutionalized

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:32.270
as the 16th century unfolded.

00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:35.910
Doctrinal controversy became
an ongoing, permanent feature

00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:38.370
of the Reformation era.

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:40.930
The leading protagonist of
these controversies were mostly

00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:43.560
university-trained theologians,

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.450
but similar views
were also expressed

00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:48.460
in polemical propaganda,
pamphlets, sermons,

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:52.950
songs that denounced papists
or heretics respectively.

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:57.030
By the 1650s, theological
experts were as far apart

00:35:57.030 --> 00:36:01.320
as in the 1520s, marshalling
their often formidable learning

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:04.110
to buttress their
respective positions.

00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:06.600
Ditto for lay Catholics
and Protestants,

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:09.530
though in many parts of
Europe, however grudgingly,

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:11.600
they were starting to
forge various means

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:14.140
of day-to-day coexistence.

00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:17.890
Not wanting to compromise
was understandable.

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:20.320
Divisive disagreements
about doctrine were deepened

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:23.130
by the so-called
Wars of Religion,

00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:25.930
which we really should call
the wars of more than religion,

00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:28.570
because religion was about
so much more than religion

00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:31.300
as we usually think of it.

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:34.020
These conflicts included
the German Peasants' War

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:36.820
of the mid-1520s,
the Schmalkaldic War

00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:40.710
in the Holy Roman Empire,
1546 to '47, the French Wars

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:45.290
of Religion from 1562 to 1598,
the Dutch revolt against Spain

00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:49.200
that started in 1566
and lasted until 1648,

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:52.290
the Thirty Years' War
from 1618 to 1648,

00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:56.860
and the English revolution
of the 1640s and 50s.

00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:59.720
These religiopolitical
conflicts were expensive,

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:02.410
destructive, and inconclusive.

00:37:02.410 --> 00:37:06.940
They brought widespread death,
disease, and dislocation.

00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:09.790
They caused suffering
and bitterness.

00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:12.790
They created thousands
of religious refugees.

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:19.420
The Reformation era was both
constructive and destructive.

00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:21.310
Distinct churches,
religious traditions,

00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:24.020
and Christian identities were
forged and carried forward

00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:28.290
into the modern era, and they
were protected and promoted

00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:31.280
by political regimes
whose mutual conflicts,

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:33.410
like their doctrinal
disagreements,

00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:35.220
made Christian truth

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:39.030
into a civilizational
bone of contention.

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:41.260
The Reformation period
was an area

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:44.110
of extraordinary
religious vitality.

00:37:44.110 --> 00:37:46.580
It extended and deepened
the medieval assumption

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:50.030
that Christianity should
influence and infuse all areas

00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:52.940
of human life because
it expressed God's will

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:57.280
for human beings, so of course,
religion should be about more

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:59.900
than just beliefs,
worship, and devotion.

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:02.810
It should also inform
the exercise of power,

00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:05.800
social relationships,
economic transactions,

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:08.400
and higher education,
and in order

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:11.110
to do this, it had to be shared.

00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:16.300
It had to be collective,
not merely individual.

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:19.580
Yet this widely shared
assumption was precisely what

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:24.340
made Christianity such a major
problem in the Reformation era.

00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:27.860
When people agree that religion
should be the foundation

00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:32.310
of their civilization but they
can't agree about its content,

00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:34.290
they're in for trouble.

00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:37.570
That's why sustained
disagreement is the most

00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:40.830
decisive basic fact about
the Reformation era,

00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:43.160
painfully tragic as it is

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:46.890
for ecumenically
minded Christians today.

00:38:46.890 --> 00:38:50.810
Christendom's foundation had
become its central problem,

00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:53.910
so it fractured violently.

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:56.510
The disruptiveness
of and resistance

00:38:56.510 --> 00:39:01.010
to the Reformation were evident
already in the early 1520s.

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:03.730
In many different,
prolonged, and convoluted ways,

00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:05.790
they played out across
the European continent

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:07.990
for over a century.

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:12.790
By the mid-17th century, a new
sort of creativity was needed

00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:17.560
if an exhausted continent was
to avoid a fratricidal future.

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:23.350
What do you do when the source
of your world view, values,

00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:27.560
and framework of meaning is
also the source of recurrent,

00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:33.020
large-scale violence and an
insuperable impasse of ideas.

00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:35.100
Maybe you try to find a
different source of meaning

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:39.670
and some new ideas, and you
do what you can to restrain

00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:44.080
and redefine the source
that created the problems.

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:46.360
That's what those
espousing new ideas

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:50.490
and institutions started
doing in the mid-17th century,

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:56.300
and so we move on to act
four, Modernity as a Response

00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:59.380
to the Reformation era.

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:00.680
The Reformation --

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:02.580
-- was a religious
revolution that led

00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:05.610
to the secularization
of society.

00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:08.170
Major paradox.

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:09.470
It's not what Luther

00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:12.280
or any other Protestant
reformers wanted,

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:15.800
but you're in a position now
to understand how it happened.

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:18.870
The Reformation made the
religion of Latin Christendom

00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:21.880
into an unprecedented
problem rooted

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:24.660
in doctrinal disagreements
and manifest in more

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:26.790
than religious conflicts.

00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:28.950
The problem had to be addressed.

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:31.890
How could Christians who
believed contrary things

00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:34.460
about fundamental
aspects of human life

00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:38.410
on which they believed eternal
salvation depended coexist

00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:41.360
in relative peace and stability?

00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:46.210
It's often harder to discern
history's gradual processes

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:48.180
than its discrete events.

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:51.160
This goes for the unintended
processes of secularization

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:53.960
that have followed from
the Reformation era.

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:56.550
We have to take a
perspective on change over time

00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:59.990
across centuries in
order to see them.

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:03.160
They did not emerge quickly
or win the day suddenly

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:07.430
in the 17th century,
or even in the 19th.

00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:10.880
Religious has been and remains,
of course, a constant presence

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:13.440
in Europe and North America
throughout the modern era

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:15.570
to our own day.

00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:19.390
Here, then, secularization
does not mean the disappearance

00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:21.760
or the elimination of religion.

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:23.270
It doesn't mean merely a decline

00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:25.960
in how many people
attend worship, or pray,

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:28.330
or say they believe in God.

00:41:28.330 --> 00:41:31.180
It refers rather to the
declining influence of religion

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:35.520
in shared public life, all
those areas of human life

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:38.990
that in the Middle Ages and the
Reformation era Christianity was

00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:44.640
supposed to inform: politics,
law, economics, education,

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:49.940
social relationships, family
life, morality, and culture.

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:53.600
Western modernity has everything
to do with the management

00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:57.630
and control of religion
because in the Reformation era,

00:41:57.630 --> 00:42:01.260
Christianity itself
became such a problem.

00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:03.790
The disagreements mattered
so much because religion was

00:42:03.790 --> 00:42:05.900
about so much more
than religion,

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:08.950
with eternal ramifications
to boot,

00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:12.460
so when the disagreements gained
social and political traction

00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:14.650
and grew beyond a certain point,

00:42:14.650 --> 00:42:17.610
as they did in the Holy Roman
Empire, France, England,

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:22.340
and the low countries, the
results were cataclysmic.

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:25.280
The basic solution to the
problem, then, and the core

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:28.310
of the piecemeal processes
of secularization central

00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:31.460
to western modernity
meant finding ways

00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:34.160
to make whatever was
disruptive and divisive

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:38.660
about religion matter
less for public life.

00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:39.960
Christian controversies

00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:42.250
and conflicts threatened
coexistence.

00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:45.550
For centuries, Christianity had
been embedded in and intended

00:42:45.550 --> 00:42:47.570
to influence everything,

00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:51.120
so its problematic features
should be disembedded

00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:52.980
from everything.

00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:55.600
What would that entail?

00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:58.570
In order for it to be separated
from politics, economics,

00:42:58.570 --> 00:43:01.530
and social relationships,
religion had to be conceived

00:43:01.530 --> 00:43:04.190
as something separable
from them.

00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:07.040
Seen the other way around,
politics, economics,

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:09.730
and social relationships had
to be conceived as things

00:43:09.730 --> 00:43:13.560
that could and should
operate apart from religion.

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:17.150
So religion itself had to
be redefined along the lines

00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:19.730
of what we usually
mean by religion,

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:23.060
your own interior beliefs,
worship preferences,

00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:25.680
and chosen devotional practices.

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:28.280
Those were fine, because
they didn't aspire

00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:33.660
to influence anything that was
supposed to apply to everyone.

00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:37.550
Note your beliefs,
preferences, and choices.

00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:39.750
That is crucial.

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:41.060
The modern redefinition

00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:44.880
of religion meant making
it an individual choice.

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:47.640
Individual religious
freedom was made possible

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:52.140
because religion was redefined
and its scope restricted.

00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:54.410
Individuals, sometimes
within the same families,

00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:57.280
disagreed about religion
in the Reformation era,

00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:59.410
so religious freedom
would have to be protected

00:43:59.410 --> 00:44:01.900
at the individual level.

00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:05.540
This was a dramatic change
from sharing religious beliefs

00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:09.410
and practices that applied to
everyone, a democratization

00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:14.220
of Luther's "here I stand" in
a way he would have deplored,

00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:17.060
as is clear from his harsh
polemics against those

00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:20.000
who disagreed with him.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.580
Whatever its content, religion
could be tolerated so long

00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:26.370
as everyone who benefited
from religious freedom agreed

00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:30.580
on limiting its scope in
the same ways and agreed

00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:33.160
to obey the political
authorities that extended

00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:35.920
and protected that freedom.

00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:38.810
The restriction and redefinition
of religion opened the way

00:44:38.810 --> 00:44:41.840
to secularization
through separation,

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:44.640
although in practice,
that detachment has been

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:47.550
and remains a very
complicated process

00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:51.290
that has been unfolding
over centuries.

00:44:51.290 --> 00:44:55.070
Secularization as an ongoing
process has also had a long-term

00:44:55.070 --> 00:44:57.430
intellectual dimension.

00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:59.690
It's no accident that
the Enlightenment

00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:03.600
and modern philosophy
started in the 17th century.

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:06.050
Christian ideas about
reality, human nature,

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:08.400
and human life provided
Christendom's intellectual

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:10.940
backbone during the Middle Ages.

00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:15.110
During the Reformation era,
that backbone was broken.

00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:16.900
Theological controversy
that started

00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:21.150
in the 1520s remained
unresolved in the 1650s,

00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:24.490
after the Thirty Years' War
and the English revolution.

00:45:24.490 --> 00:45:26.860
How could entrenched
religious opponents agree

00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:30.110
about human nature, morality,
government, and other issues

00:45:30.110 --> 00:45:33.300
at once fundamental
and divisive?

00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:35.580
They'd have to agree
to disagree.

00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:37.600
They'd have to bracket
their religious views

00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:41.020
when they embarked
on common endeavors.

00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:44.590
Theology would have to be
separated from philosophy

00:45:44.590 --> 00:45:47.730
and the investigation
of the natural world,

00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:52.800
neither of which could depend on
anything divisively religious.

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:54.950
New ways of trying
to ground morality,

00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:59.210
justify political authority, and
conceive society were sought.

00:45:59.210 --> 00:46:00.930
Descriptions of and
prescriptions

00:46:00.930 --> 00:46:04.300
for human life would have
to avoid explicit reference

00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:07.710
to religion if they
hoped to persuade people

00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:09.790
who disagreed about it.

00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:12.670
If you didn't want to just
keep preaching to choir,

00:46:12.670 --> 00:46:16.000
you had to learn how to
sing a different song.

00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:19.180
Ideas and institutions central

00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:22.480
to modern liberal democracies
are interrelated aspects

00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:25.840
of the ways that western
modernity has addressed problems

00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:28.150
inherited from the
Reformation era

00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:31.480
as a reaction, not
as an outgrowth.

00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:34.350
These include individual
freedom and autonomy,

00:46:34.350 --> 00:46:37.960
freedom of religion, religious
toleration, the separation

00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:41.000
of church and state,
secular public discourse,

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.770
the secularization of
knowledge, and the pursuit

00:46:43.770 --> 00:46:48.220
of human fulfilment
through material well-being.

00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:50.940
Just like the beginning of
the Reformation in Wittenberg,

00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:54.200
the process of addressing the
Reformation era's problems

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:57.550
in a new way started
in an unlikely place,

00:46:57.550 --> 00:46:59.540
in a strange little
republic at war

00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:02.050
with Europe's most
powerful monarchy,

00:47:02.050 --> 00:47:05.550
from which it had just
declared its independence.

00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:09.730
In the 1580s, no one in their
right mind would have bet

00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:12.690
on the Dutch republic in
revolt against mighty Spain

00:47:12.690 --> 00:47:16.110
and its empire, yet the
magistrates and the merchants,

00:47:16.110 --> 00:47:20.420
especially of Holland's cities,
hit on something important.

00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:23.690
They decided to de-emphasize
religious uniformity

00:47:23.690 --> 00:47:25.310
and to go shopping instead,

00:47:25.310 --> 00:47:30.920
and that's what we're
still doing, for real.

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:34.770
Holland's urban leaders combined
limited religious toleration

00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:37.360
with a seaborne trading
empire in what turned

00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:39.710
out to be the wave
of the future.

00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:42.580
They hit on a new relationship
among religion, politics,

00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:46.020
and economics that would
eventually change the world,

00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:49.780
sowing secularizing seeds of
modernity in the tough soil

00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:52.180
of the Reformation era.

00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:55.090
Much else would fertilize it,
including Enlightenment ideas,

00:47:55.090 --> 00:47:58.020
but they got the
process started.

00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:00.050
Europeans in other
countries noticed.

00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:02.730
The British in particular
imitated the Dutch

00:48:02.730 --> 00:48:04.260
and integrated what they learned

00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:06.840
into their own much
more powerful empire

00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:10.040
in the later 17th
and 18th centuries.

00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:13.760
It turned out that religious
toleration was good for business

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:17.310
so long as the scope of religion
was restricted and didn't,

00:48:17.310 --> 00:48:21.340
heaven forbid, seek to inhibit
entrepreneurial initiative

00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:24.600
or to curtail expansionist
political ambition.

00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:27.590
What the Dutch started
was extended

00:48:27.590 --> 00:48:31.010
and first institutionalized
in other odd republic at war

00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:35.770
with that British empire,
the United States of America.

00:48:35.770 --> 00:48:38.510
It combined the federal
disestablishment of churches

00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:41.840
with individual religious
freedom and no proscriptions

00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:45.630
about how citizens should act
on their newly protected rights

00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:48.750
to life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness.

00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:52.430
A narrow Dutch notion
of religion persisted.

00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:55.050
American citizens could
believe as they pleased

00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:57.890
and worship as they wished.

00:48:57.890 --> 00:49:00.060
At the same place,
whether rich or poor,

00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:02.710
Americans exercised
their religious freedom

00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:05.470
as they pursued more and
better material possessions,

00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:08.310
just like the Dutch and
the British before them.

00:49:08.310 --> 00:49:11.220
The advent of the Industrial
Revolution that coincided

00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:14.420
with the creation of the new
nation enabled many more people

00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:18.080
to acquire many more
possessions much more cheaply.

00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:21.330
Industrialization in the 19th
century solidified this trend

00:49:21.330 --> 00:49:23.960
in the US as well as in
western European countries,

00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:26.160
some sooner than others.

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:29.910
It gave everyone something
besides religion to care about

00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:32.780
and to devote themselves to.

00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:35.440
The most recent expressions
of secularization borne

00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:37.940
of the relationship
among religion, politics,

00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:41.090
and economics, have been visible
in the last several decades

00:49:41.090 --> 00:49:43.650
on both sides of
the north Atlantic.

00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:45.880
Religion's influence
has diminished

00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:48.740
as material affluence
has soared.

00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:50.890
Religion has ceased
to have much, if any,

00:49:50.890 --> 00:49:55.720
capacity to influence
society in shared public ways.

00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:59.100
Religious pluralism enabled
by religious freedom means

00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:00.400
that when religious citizens --

00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:02.450
-- do enter the public arena,

00:50:02.450 --> 00:50:06.540
their participation mirrors
a secularized and, in the US,

00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:09.710
deeply divided public
political culture.

00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:13.210
One could hardly ask for a more
spectacular expression of this

00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:17.570
than what emerged starting with
our most recent election cycle.

00:50:17.570 --> 00:50:20.710
Christianity has little capacity
to influence the wider society

00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:24.740
in any collective way because
Christians themselves are

00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:27.870
divided on every
contentious political, social,

00:50:27.870 --> 00:50:32.040
and moral issue, including
abortion, same-sex marriage,

00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:34.100
gun control, immigration,

00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:36.180
international interventions
abroad,

00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:40.700
and the current occupant
of the White House.

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:44.450
Democratic states today protect
an ever-increasing diversity

00:50:44.450 --> 00:50:47.400
of beliefs, priorities,
and practices.

00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:49.420
A nearly universal participation

00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:52.520
in consumerism capitalism
plus political control

00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:57.170
by those states served to hold
western societies together,

00:50:57.170 --> 00:51:00.750
or at least seemed to
relatively well until Brexit

00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:03.880
and then the 2016
American election showed

00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:06.520
that there were political
costs to four decades

00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:10.790
of economic neoliberalism,
but these long-term outcomes

00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:12.840
of attempts to solve
the problems inherited

00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:15.830
from the Reformation era have
unintentionally created new

00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:20.100
problems of their own, for
example, global climate change,

00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:24.100
a byproduct of the industrial
processes that manufacture all

00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:27.520
that stuff that politically
protected consumers want

00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:30.870
in exercising their rights.

00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:32.170
Long-term processes

00:51:32.170 --> 00:51:35.170
of secularization have been
an attempt to control religion

00:51:35.170 --> 00:51:37.750
and to resolve the
difficulties that followed

00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:40.050
in the wake of the Reformation.

00:51:40.050 --> 00:51:43.700
They're not an extension or
fulfilment of the Lutheranism

00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:46.990
or the reform Protestantism
of the Reformation era.

00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:49.810
Choosing your own beliefs
and values, whether religious

00:51:49.810 --> 00:51:52.270
or not, and buying
as much as you want

00:51:52.270 --> 00:51:55.690
of whatever you want are
worlds away from the freedom

00:51:55.690 --> 00:51:58.550
of a Christian espoused
by Luther,

00:51:58.550 --> 00:52:02.220
and when we see what modern
freedom can mean in practice,

00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:06.350
in terms of choosing to believe
and support whatever you prefer,

00:52:06.350 --> 00:52:10.080
as, for example, in our most
recent presidential election,

00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:14.280
we get some sense of just how
far-reaching have been the

00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:17.880
modern institutional and
ideological endeavors to deal

00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:22.470
with the problems inherited
from the Reformation era.

00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:24.720
So in brief and by
way of conclusion,

00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:27.440
that's why the Reformation
still matters,

00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:29.660
whether we like it or not.

00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:30.960
It unintentionally

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:34.300
and indirectly created
the world we inhabit,

00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:36.870
regardless of what we
believe or care about,

00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:40.180
by making Christianity itself
into an enduring problem

00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:42.650
that had to be addressed.

00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:46.440
The way it was addressed
redefined religion

00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:49.570
and made it separable
from the rest of life,

00:52:49.570 --> 00:52:52.730
and now increasingly,
we see evidence of what

00:52:52.730 --> 00:52:56.810
that separation looks like,
and we will, I'm sure,

00:52:56.810 --> 00:53:00.900
continue to see evidence of it
facilitated by the combination

00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:03.610
of politically protected
individual preferences,

00:53:03.610 --> 00:53:07.360
technological wizardry, and
the power of money distributed

00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:10.010
with radical inequality,
some expressions

00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:11.570
of which we probably
can't imagine

00:53:11.570 --> 00:53:13.980
and which will probably
be as unexpected

00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:16.170
as were the eventual
consequences

00:53:16.170 --> 00:53:19.720
of the Reformation
500 years ago.

00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:22.800
So whatever one makes of
our current situation,

00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:26.090
and thinks we ought to do, and
whatever scale of engagement

00:53:26.090 --> 00:53:29.450
or action, it seems to
me we're well advised

00:53:29.450 --> 00:53:32.530
to acknowledge the
character of that situation

00:53:32.530 --> 00:53:35.040
and how we got to where we are.

00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:36.690
It presents challenges
to all of us,

00:53:36.690 --> 00:53:39.840
regardless of what we
believe and regardless

00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:42.990
of the specific geographical,
institutional,

00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:46.250
and social locations we inhabit.

00:53:46.250 --> 00:53:48.050
Thank you.

00:53:48.050 --> 00:53:57.230
[ Applause ]

00:53:57.230 --> 00:54:00.240
So my understanding is now that
there's time for some questions,

00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:02.330
so long as they're
easy, softball questions

00:54:02.330 --> 00:54:03.640
and benign in every respect.

00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:05.220
I'm being facetious, of course.

00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:06.520
Sir in the front here.

00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:10.260
&gt;&gt; This is a question about the
great man theorem of history.

00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:14.210
I mean there were popular
reformers [inaudible] and 15th,

00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:22.330
16th century, and there was, of
course, Erasmus and [inaudible].

00:54:22.330 --> 00:54:25.620
He was admired by Luther.

00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:28.830
Erasmus was an intellectual.

00:54:28.830 --> 00:54:32.670
I don't think he was -- I don't
think he really had much popular

00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:36.300
appeal, but what about if
there hadn't been some guy

00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:38.610
like Luther, as forceful,
as charismatic,

00:54:38.610 --> 00:54:43.260
as belligerent in
his viewpoints?

00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:46.180
Would the Reformation
have occurred?

00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:47.480
&gt;&gt; Brad Gregory:
Yeah, so this is one

00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:50.720
of those giant what historians
call counterfactual questions.

00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:52.210
If it hadn't been
for Luther, right,

00:54:52.210 --> 00:54:54.110
then what would have happened?

00:54:54.110 --> 00:54:56.550
One of the difficulties of
trying to answer a question

00:54:56.550 --> 00:55:00.460
like this about a
phenomenon that, if even half

00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:03.030
of what I've argued tonight
is right, the Reformation was

00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:07.300
so dramatically transformative,
it's hard to imagine

00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:08.600
if it hadn't happened, well,

00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:09.900
how might things have
transpired differently.

00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:15.890
So that's the dodge aspect of
my answer to your question.

00:55:15.890 --> 00:55:18.580
I think -- well,
there's certainly --

00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:21.200
there are all kinds
of reform initiatives

00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:23.920
and so forth underway
prior to Martin Luther.

00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:27.280
This has been one of the really
important, I think, developments

00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:28.920
in scholarship on
the late Middle Ages

00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:32.100
and the early 16th
century in recent decades.

00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:34.810
You mention Erasmus, and I mean
I think it's very interesting,

00:55:34.810 --> 00:55:38.650
because Erasmian humanism
and Erasmus' vision

00:55:38.650 --> 00:55:40.400
for the gradual reform

00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:42.800
of Christendom is very
different from Luther's.

00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:46.800
It's based primarily
on patient education.

00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:50.040
Humanist scholars, no
surprise, are the heroes.

00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:52.070
They're the ones who
have the languages

00:55:52.070 --> 00:55:53.600
and are doing the philological

00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:56.250
and the scholarly research
that's going to go back

00:55:56.250 --> 00:55:58.820
to the sources, as
they say, ad fontes,

00:55:58.820 --> 00:56:02.930
and by producing reliable
editions of the scriptures,

00:56:02.930 --> 00:56:05.290
as Erasmus himself
did -- well, reliable.

00:56:05.290 --> 00:56:10.610
Not by the criteria of
contemporary biblical scholars,

00:56:10.610 --> 00:56:12.620
but very much so at the time.

00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:17.330
His edition of the 1516 New
Testament with facing text,

00:56:17.330 --> 00:56:21.810
Latin and Greek is incredibly
important, but the question is:

00:56:21.810 --> 00:56:26.450
You know, what might Erasmian
humanism have achieved had,

00:56:26.450 --> 00:56:28.150
you know, there not
been someone, again,

00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:30.870
as sort of insistent
and, as you said,

00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:33.060
belligerent as Martin Luther?

00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:36.140
There certainly are other
reformers who reject Rome

00:56:36.140 --> 00:56:38.130
in the course of the 1520s

00:56:38.130 --> 00:56:40.590
who have personalities very
different from Martin Luther.

00:56:40.590 --> 00:56:44.800
Huldrych Zwingli can be nasty,
but nothing like Luther.

00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:47.940
And so I think, you know, in
the end, we're left with sort

00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:51.190
of speculative, interesting
discussion, fun discussion

00:56:51.190 --> 00:56:53.910
to talk about over a beer, but
I think it's really impossible

00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:59.080
to resolve in any kind of
compelling or kind of, you know,

00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:03.160
universally persuasive way what
might have transpired instead

00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:05.880
without -- major historical
counterfactuals, I think,

00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:07.690
simply have that character.

00:57:07.690 --> 00:57:10.710
Thanks. Yes, sir?

00:57:10.710 --> 00:57:14.260
&gt;&gt; I'm just curious.

00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:17.520
I would like to hear
your thoughts

00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:25.670
about the second large religion,
Islam, which has had this schism

00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:28.900
between the Sunni and the
Shiite for centuries, for much,

00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:33.730
much longer than the
Catholicism and Martin Luther,

00:57:33.730 --> 00:57:38.080
which after a couple of
hundreds years of vicious wars,

00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:42.140
Thirty Years' War, other wars,
came to an understanding and led

00:57:42.140 --> 00:57:47.250
to the religious freedom
which you espoused here.

00:57:47.250 --> 00:57:52.940
What do you foresee, if
anything, in speculations?

00:57:52.940 --> 00:57:57.780
Is there a possibility between
the Sunni and the Shiite,

00:57:57.780 --> 00:58:01.500
which have been fighting each
other for over a thousand years,

00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:03.740
well over a thousand
years, that they would come

00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:08.190
to an accommodation at
any time in the future

00:58:08.190 --> 00:58:12.590
like there has been development
in the Christian world?

00:58:12.590 --> 00:58:15.970
&gt;&gt; Brad Gregory: Well, I have
a dodge on this question, too.

00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:19.830
The question is prospects for
the relationship between Sunni

00:58:19.830 --> 00:58:22.490
and Shia Muslims in
terms of reconciliation

00:58:22.490 --> 00:58:26.650
in the future analogous
to that, the kind of ways

00:58:26.650 --> 00:58:28.770
of accommodating
coexistence that Protestants

00:58:28.770 --> 00:58:31.170
and Catholics have to
large extent achieved

00:58:31.170 --> 00:58:33.360
in the modern world in the west.

00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:36.470
My dodge on this is I'm
not a scholar of Islam.

00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:38.820
I really am not, so
I'm not -- the other --

00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:40.940
it's fascinating to me.

00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:43.040
One, I get a counterfactual
question

00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:44.810
about if Luther hadn't
come along,

00:58:44.810 --> 00:58:46.730
how might everything have
been different in the past,

00:58:46.730 --> 00:58:49.330
and now I get a question about,
you know, what do you foresee

00:58:49.330 --> 00:58:51.270
in the future about the
relationship between --

00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:53.370
you know, I'm just
a humble historian.

00:58:53.370 --> 00:58:58.650
I try to study what actually
happened and how it played out.

00:58:58.650 --> 00:59:06.300
That said, I mean, well, the
relationship of different groups

00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:10.060
within Islam, including, most
importantly, Sunni and Shia,

00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:12.630
but they're not the only
ones, is, of course,

00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:16.420
one important dimension of the
kinds of conflicts and unrest

00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:18.590
that we see in not
only the Middle East,

00:59:18.590 --> 00:59:20.420
other parts of the
world, and so forth.

00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:23.830
Another critically
important part is the ways

00:59:23.830 --> 00:59:27.100
in which western powers
intervened in the Middle East

00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:29.090
in the late 19th and
early 20th centuries

00:59:29.090 --> 00:59:30.830
and arbitrarily divided up,

00:59:30.830 --> 00:59:33.000
sliced and diced different
countries, and so forth,

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:36.500
and created problems because
of the borders that they drew

00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:38.800
in ways that were
not there before.

00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:41.970
So many of the problems
that we see

00:59:41.970 --> 00:59:46.590
in the Islamic world today are
at least difficult to extricate

00:59:46.590 --> 00:59:49.440
from the western
interventions of the last,

00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:51.960
say, century and a half.

00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:54.580
Another crucially important
question, and one I think

00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:57.110
that many westerners
are at least

00:59:57.110 --> 01:00:00.410
as concerned with, is about --

01:00:00.410 --> 01:00:03.640
-- the ways in which Muslims,
whether Sunni, or Shia,

01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:07.690
or from some other group,
are likely to, able to,

01:00:07.690 --> 01:00:11.570
or willing to make the
sort of accommodation

01:00:11.570 --> 01:00:15.350
that most liberal westerners
hope that they will make,

01:00:15.350 --> 01:00:17.310
and that, it seems to me,

01:00:17.310 --> 01:00:19.950
is maybe even a more
pressing question than the one

01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:22.930
about the relationship
between Sunni and Shia.

01:00:22.930 --> 01:00:27.920
I'll make just one sort
of side comment on that.

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:31.200
It seems to me, and I say
this partly from my reading

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:35.420
and also partly from talking
to some Muslim friends,

01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:40.710
they look at certain aspects
of western society and see it

01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:43.680
as a negative lesson in what
they don't want to happen

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:46.520
to their own societies
and the ways in which --

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:48.830
when I talk about religion
as more than religion here

01:00:48.830 --> 01:00:51.610
in the early 16th century,
religion is more than religion

01:00:51.610 --> 01:00:54.060
in Muslim societies today, too,

01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:57.240
even ones that are relatively
liberal, to say nothing

01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:01.470
of the ones that have the kind
of tightest interwoven aspect

01:01:01.470 --> 01:01:04.620
of Islam with all dimensions
of life, and when they look

01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:08.080
at the west, for example,
and they say, "Yeah,

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:10.390
you say it's awful what
we do to our women,

01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:14.710
but look at the widespread
pornography on every available,

01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:18.650
right, downloadable laptop
everywhere in the western world.

01:01:18.650 --> 01:01:20.450
Which one of those
is worse, you know?"

01:01:20.450 --> 01:01:22.240
I've had Muslim friends
say things like that to me.

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:26.480
So the only point being I don't
think it's a simple problem,

01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:31.530
and I don't think that all
the aces are held by the west.

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:35.510
Yes, in the back.

01:01:36.590 --> 01:01:41.510
&gt;&gt; If religion and Christianity
-- before the Reformation,

01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:47.840
I would say that it
held us together.

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:51.470
It was like a skeleton
or a basis

01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:56.170
on which people were informed as
to how to behave, how to live,

01:01:56.170 --> 01:01:59.480
how to do business,
interact with each other,

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:02.720
not just what to believe, right.

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:04.180
&gt;&gt; Brad Gregory: Yeah,
about practice as much --

01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:06.710
in fact, practice even
more, in some ways,

01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:08.010
than explicit beliefs.

01:02:08.010 --> 01:02:11.180
&gt;&gt; Well, now, recently, I
spent 11 years living in India

01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:15.080
with Tibetan refugees,
and they, too, live --

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:18.730
they live their religion.

01:02:18.730 --> 01:02:20.820
It informs everything --

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:22.120
&gt;&gt; Brad Gregory: Right.

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:25.610
&gt;&gt; -- they do, and I
see when they leave,

01:02:28.430 --> 01:02:29.590
because many are trying
to leave, when they come

01:02:29.590 --> 01:02:36.220
to the west and they no longer
live in that society, they, too,

01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:41.740
like us -- I mean it was the
glue that held them together

01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:44.420
and held their culture together.

01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:48.900
Well, what you have just
described is we are all

01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:50.430
drifting apart.

01:02:50.430 --> 01:02:54.360
We're drifting further and
further away from anything

01:02:54.360 --> 01:03:00.210
that we can all recognize
and value,

01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:02.120
and if that is the case --

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:06.400
and I have another example
as a retired schoolteacher.

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:08.880
I see that in our schools.

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:14.440
Our schools no longer teach
the basic, classical education.

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:21.230
They just don't, and so
now, I was just talking

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:26.570
to an intern today, and he
said, "Nowadays in school,

01:03:26.570 --> 01:03:32.250
kids just focus on what
kind of job they want.

01:03:32.250 --> 01:03:37.230
That's what they're focused on."

01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:39.360
So let's say somebody wants

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:45.110
to be a mathematician,
so they study math.

01:03:45.110 --> 01:03:52.240
They don't know anything else,
so who do they relate to?

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:56.340
Who can they relate to?

01:03:56.340 --> 01:03:57.640
&gt;&gt; Brad Gregory: Yeah.

01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:59.470
&gt;&gt; Another mathematician,
you know, but not the rest

01:03:59.470 --> 01:04:03.180
of the world, so
even our own society,

01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:07.340
as you're suggesting,
is drifting apart.

01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:09.970
There's nothing to hold
us together anymore,

01:04:09.970 --> 01:04:13.390
and if there is, please
tell us what it is.

01:04:13.390 --> 01:04:14.690
&gt;&gt; Brad Gregory: Hey, you
know, you're preaching

01:04:14.690 --> 01:04:16.140
to the choir on that one.

01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:19.100
I mean that's very close to
my analysis of the situation

01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:20.400
in which we find ourselves.

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:21.730
I published a book
several years ago --

01:04:21.730 --> 01:04:24.600
Nicholas mentioned it
in his introduction --

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:28.760
called The Unintended
Reformation,

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:32.080
in which I said some things
about the kind of divisiveness

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:37.480
and the dividedness of
particularly Americans,

01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:41.670
but we can see it also
in different guises

01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:44.210
in western European
countries as well.

01:04:44.210 --> 01:04:51.040
That was published in 2012, and
it was really interesting to me.

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:54.790
During the course of the
election, before November

01:04:54.790 --> 01:04:58.610
of 2016, I got a number
of emails from readers

01:04:58.610 --> 01:05:05.670
of that book saying, "So I mean
it's scary how spot-on you were,

01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:12.640
you know, about this," because
there was an important debate

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:18.460
among observers and
analysts in the United States

01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:21.290
in recent years about, you know,

01:05:21.290 --> 01:05:25.870
"Is there really culture
wars in the United States?

01:05:25.870 --> 01:05:28.410
Oh, it's just some
small, vocal minorities.

01:05:28.410 --> 01:05:33.480
Really, most Americans agree and
can get along with one another,"

01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:38.080
and I think -- I mean now, we'd
be hard pressed to find anybody,

01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:40.190
I think, who would
defend the view

01:05:40.190 --> 01:05:45.420
that it's not really
deeply divided.

01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:47.700
The question then, of
course, is, you know,

01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:49.540
really, where do we turn?

01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:53.040
What are the, you know, possible
alternatives for something

01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:55.350
that could, you know, function?

01:05:55.350 --> 01:05:57.860
What's deeply troubling
to me and many others --

01:05:57.860 --> 01:06:00.350
again, I'm not saying
anything that probably all

01:06:00.350 --> 01:06:02.040
of you haven't heard ad nauseam

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:03.560
in the last year in
terms of analysis.

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:06.450
What's particularly disturbing
is what I would call a crisis

01:06:06.450 --> 01:06:08.180
of shared epistemology.

01:06:08.180 --> 01:06:11.520
By that I mean we don't even
agree on what the sources

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:14.350
of our information
are to be able

01:06:14.350 --> 01:06:17.160
to have a shared discussion,
so the determination

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:24.610
of what is the case, the facts,
are, well, you know, "No,

01:06:24.610 --> 01:06:29.400
I'll get mine from Breitbart.

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:32.620
You get yours from MSNBC."

01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:36.390
You know, it's impossible
to have a shared discussion

01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:39.910
if you don't agree substantially
on what the [inaudible] are.

01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:44.000
I don't have an answer to that.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.290
Again, this is amazing.

01:06:46.290 --> 01:06:50.090
It's like how would
you speculate

01:06:50.090 --> 01:06:55.740
that the past would have
been utterly different

01:06:55.740 --> 01:06:58.790
without Luther, what do
you think's going to happen

01:06:58.790 --> 01:07:05.000
to Muslims in the future,
and please give us the answer

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.840
to our incredibly
divided problems.

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:09.140
No problem.

01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:12.730
That's what historians
are trained to do.

01:07:12.730 --> 01:07:16.530
So anyway, maybe we have
time for one more question.

01:07:16.530 --> 01:07:17.830
Yeah, sir, in the back?

01:07:17.830 --> 01:07:20.340
&gt;&gt; It may be a question,
may be more of a comment.

01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:23.780
You talked about basically how
after the Thirty Years' War,

01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:27.970
things started to -- the
church basically went

01:07:27.970 --> 01:07:29.530
to a very scholastic place,

01:07:29.530 --> 01:07:32.450
but I think there was
still a cultural divide

01:07:32.450 --> 01:07:35.630
between the intellectual,
philosophical part of the church

01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:41.890
and the pietistic movement in
Europe that eventually came here

01:07:41.890 --> 01:07:47.480
in this country that brought us
the two Great Awakenings a very

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:50.390
conservative religious
movement that continues,

01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:53.660
possibly through the Charismatic
movement, to this day,

01:07:53.660 --> 01:07:58.990
where the church itself has
divided again, in a certain way.

01:07:58.990 --> 01:08:00.790
Could you comment about that?

01:08:00.790 --> 01:08:03.150
&gt;&gt; Brad Gregory: Well, I mean
there really never is a point

01:08:03.150 --> 01:08:05.870
from even the early
decades of the Reformation

01:08:05.870 --> 01:08:08.620
in the 16th century
when Protestantism seen

01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:10.910
as a whole doesn't
encompass an enormous variety

01:08:10.910 --> 01:08:12.700
of different movements,
churches, organizations,

01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:16.160
and so forth, so yes, of
course, I mean in terms

01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:19.820
of whether we're talking about
an anglophone context and, say,

01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:23.930
talking about Methodism and
John Wesley in the 18th century

01:08:23.930 --> 01:08:29.720
as a kind of intra-Anglican
pietistic movement, say,

01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:31.170
that's parallel to what's going

01:08:31.170 --> 01:08:34.770
on in German-speaking
territories with respect

01:08:34.770 --> 01:08:40.150
to Lutheranism, because pietism,
the usual meaning of pietism

01:08:40.150 --> 01:08:43.120
that starts in the
early 17th century,

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:45.090
with people like
Arndt and others.

01:08:45.090 --> 01:08:47.330
Those are absolutely part of,

01:08:47.330 --> 01:08:50.570
would fit into what I was
talking when I'm talking

01:08:50.570 --> 01:08:52.430
about the constructive
aspects, right,

01:08:52.430 --> 01:08:55.230
of the religious traditions that
come out of the Reformation era,

01:08:55.230 --> 01:08:59.630
not only the various Protestant
traditions, but also Catholicism

01:08:59.630 --> 01:09:01.450
that will develop and continue
to the present day as well.

01:09:01.450 --> 01:09:05.530
So yes, that is absolutely
part of the story.

01:09:05.530 --> 01:09:07.330
It fits into the picture
that I've described here,

01:09:07.330 --> 01:09:10.880
because once we get
into the modern world,

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:12.410
you can be a pietist,
you can be a Unitarian,

01:09:12.410 --> 01:09:13.710
you can be a Quaker,
you can be a Catholic,

01:09:13.710 --> 01:09:15.010
you can be a Charismatic,

01:09:15.010 --> 01:09:16.310
you can be whatever you
want to be, you know.

01:09:16.310 --> 01:09:17.610
The point is you can be
whatever you want to.

01:09:17.610 --> 01:09:18.910
Religious freedom is politically
protected, but you know,

01:09:18.910 --> 01:09:20.210
we're not going to share any
of that, right, in common.

01:09:20.210 --> 01:09:21.510
It's not going to be proscribed.

01:09:21.510 --> 01:09:22.810
You can believe whatever
you want

01:09:22.810 --> 01:09:24.110
so long as you obey the laws.

01:09:24.110 --> 01:09:25.410
That's the basic way in which
the problem of Christianity

01:09:25.410 --> 01:09:26.710
from the Reformation era
is attempted to be solved.

01:09:26.710 --> 01:09:28.010
For most of US history,
for a long time,

01:09:28.010 --> 01:09:29.310
certainly when Tocqueville
visits in the early 1830s,

01:09:29.310 --> 01:09:30.610
he looks, and he
sees, "Incredible.

01:09:30.610 --> 01:09:31.910
Look at this.

01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:33.210
All these different
Protestant groups.

01:09:33.210 --> 01:09:34.510
Even got a smattering of
Catholics and so forth,

01:09:34.510 --> 01:09:35.810
even a handful of Jews, right."

01:09:35.810 --> 01:09:37.110
He says, "All the
Christian groups, right,

01:09:37.110 --> 01:09:38.410
they all worship God
in different ways,

01:09:38.410 --> 01:09:39.710
yet they all share
the same morality.

01:09:39.710 --> 01:09:41.010
They all share a sense of
duty, and of public mindedness,

01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:42.310
and what it is that
people owe to one another."

01:09:42.310 --> 01:09:43.610
That's what's gone.

01:09:43.610 --> 01:09:44.910
That's what dissipated, and I
think in ways that are parallel

01:09:44.910 --> 01:09:46.210
to the decline of the so-called
mainstream Protestant churches

01:09:46.210 --> 01:09:47.510
in the United States, because
they were the cultural backbone

01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:48.810
of that phenomenon.

01:09:48.810 --> 01:09:50.110
So that's a situation
in which it seems

01:09:50.110 --> 01:09:51.410
to me we find ourselves,
but absolutely,

01:09:51.410 --> 01:09:52.710
those Protestant traditions
that you're talking about,

01:09:52.710 --> 01:09:54.010
that originated in Europe,
came across the Atlantic,

01:09:54.010 --> 01:09:55.310
have definitely had an influence
here, as have the others.

01:09:55.310 --> 01:09:56.610
So anyway, I could stay here all
night, but I probably shouldn't.

01:09:56.610 --> 01:09:57.910
So thanks again to
everyone for coming.

01:09:57.910 --> 01:09:59.210
I really appreciated it.

01:09:59.210 --> 01:10:00.510
Great questions, and
have a good evening.

01:10:00.510 --> 01:10:01.810
[ Applause ]
