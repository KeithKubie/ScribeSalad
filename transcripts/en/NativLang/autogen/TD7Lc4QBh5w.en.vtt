00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.069
 When I was learning Chinese characters, I encountered too many difficulties, hates, madness, and ridiculous things. 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:06.519
 When I was learning Chinese characters, I encountered too many difficulties, hates, madness, and ridiculous things. 

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:10.000
 Yes, I said some before, now I will talk about a new one. 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.100
 If you want to read or write a basic sentence in Chinese and Japanese 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.980
 Or you are interested in Middle Korea and ancient Vietnam for some reason. 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.130
 You need to learn these blocks one by one. 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.109
 So I started to learn Chinese characters. After I learned hundreds of words, I feel that I am getting started. 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.720
 Then I started to learn (the Chinese characters) different pronunciations, different meanings, and different systems. 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.430
 There is also a bunch of subsystems... When I was learning, I felt that I was hit by a Chinese character in the face. 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:37.430
 Tummy punch 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.590
 Then another punch on the face 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.680
 It’s just so bad... 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.710
 Then the Chinese character big devil suddenly made a fatal blow. 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.710
 I beat almost GG 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.140
 That fatal blow is: the pen brush of each Chinese character is smooth! 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.550
 It was quite simple at first. 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.740
 They taught me a few simple Chinese characters with only 3 or 4 strokes. 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:56.740
 And their pens 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.540
 So... the first painting? 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.560
 wrong! wrong! Wrong! 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.780
 The first painting. 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:02.800
 This time is right. 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.800
 Second painting. 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.320
 wrong again! ! ! 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.810
 This is the second painting 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:07.810
 Ok 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:08.810
 The third painting. 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.439
 Wow, not bad 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:13.130
 Then the fourth painting 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.240
 As my teacher used to say, “almost finished” 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.810
 Congratulations! 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.210
 You wrote the word "day"! Congratulations on becoming a calligrapher! 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.670
 Look at the next one 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.369
 The first painting... just like the one just 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.390
 The second painting... The amount, etc., is this the same as before, the horizontal fold? 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.170
 Yes, that’s it. 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.170
 Third painting 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.170
 wrong! 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.490
 Ok 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.140
 Then, the third painting 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.140
 Fourth painting 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.140
 Fifth painting 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.330
 Ok, so it seems that there are some rules. 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.460
 At this time, I thought that this is just a good writing skill for them. 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.121
 Each word is written in a certain numbered order 

00:01:49.121 --> 00:01:51.499
 But not so simple 

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:54.510
 It is not just like western calligraphy, just to improve the aesthetics of the word. 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:00.030
 After learning, I found that it is actually the most basic part of Chinese writing. 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.560
 If you don't know the pen is smooth, you don't even know the word 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.569
 It is sauce purple. 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:09.320
 So for example, this way, again, and finally, write a "mouth" 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.910
 This is the correct way to write 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.050
 This painting should be written up instead of down 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.190
 This painting has a small tick up 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.680
 These strokes should be before these strokes, but other strokes should be after this (the bottom) 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.850
 This word has 6 paintings instead of 4 paintings. 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.890
 Then the word has 20 paintings instead of 21 paintings. 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.660
 Don't mess with this! 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.130
 We are all watching you! 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.120
 Fortunately, I thought to myself: Hey, myself. 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.450
 ...I have discovered some rules 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.140
 Using these rules, I feel so relaxed. 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.910
 I have made great progress. 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.850
 Then one time, I saw this (word) 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.790
 Then, I saw... this (word writing) 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.750
 So I kept practicing... practice... you know. . 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.640
 Then the problem is coming again. 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.800
 One thing you must know is that these laws may change. 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.800
 I was deeply impressed by the combination of the left and right sides of the left side and the bottom and the next horizontal combination. 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.780
 It gives me a false sense of security, so I was split and reorganized into complex Chinese characters. 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.600
 Tortured 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.580
 Hey, "Song", how beautiful your melody is, but you are a nasty Chinese character. 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.410
 Moreover, a writing "formula" may apply to a certain Chinese character, but if more strokes are added, 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.700
 This rule does not apply. 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.700
 Remember the word "田" that you just said? 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.120
 It appears alone and appears in other Chinese characters, and the pen brush is not the same. 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.280
 And in China, the order of strokes is even different. 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.270
 Chinese people generally have the opposite order of the two paintings. 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.260
 So if you are in China, don't get confused. 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.440
 So yes. The pen brush of the same structure will change in different Chinese characters. 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.700
 And make the pen brush of the same Chinese character different in China and Japan. 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.450
 The difference between the two countries is not just the order of strokes. 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.920
 The first time I found this problem, I noticed the word "have". 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.530
 In China, the horizontal line and the upper part are connected. 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.900
 Moreover, the word "write" has "bao cover", but this "bao cover" is not like other Chinese characters that I am familiar with. 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.650
 There is no point above 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.900
 Moreover, the new way of writing this word is that the old version of Sauce is like this. 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.490
 In Japan, new styles have fewer strokes, while archaic characters have more strokes. 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.410
 In China, the strokes of simplified characters are generally much less. 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.010
 But China and Japan do not simplify the same word. 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.800
 So the rules I found directly even 

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.530
 Not too reliable 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.050
 But wit like you, maybe you can look back and see what 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.389
 The law I didn't notice 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:27.749
 These are all the most straight pen strokes 

00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:30.659
 This is just the direction and sequence of writing we have just been arguing. 

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:34.980
 And when you see cursive and other writing methods 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.780
 This is the case with a mess of lines and circles. 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.849
 Then there are more things to learn! 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:40.389
 But this is very important 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:44.000
 There is a wrong way to write a word, and there is a wrong way. If you mistake it wrong 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.780
 They will definitely find out 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:46.780
 But are you making it? 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.270
 Hundreds of millions of people are learning how to write these Chinese characters. 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.869
 You said this is ridiculous? Maybe,. 

00:04:50.869 --> 00:04:53.100
 I did not say that this is impossible. 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.159
 What do you think of this guest officer? 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:58.300
