00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.962
So here's another story.

00:00:01.962 --> 00:00:08.070
A while back I heard a story about
some music tests that were being run,

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.080
and it was for an interface for
a washing machine or something.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.158
And there was some problem that users
could encounter that was incredibly

00:00:16.158 --> 00:00:17.021
frustrating.

00:00:17.021 --> 00:00:20.414
It was a little bit of an edge case,
but it was incredibly frustrating.

00:00:20.414 --> 00:00:22.410
They'd lose a lot of time and
be really confused.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.008
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:23.008 --> 00:00:26.470
&gt;&gt; And the testers, the designers
who were working on this project

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.745
went to the engineers and said,
hey, this is a big problem!

00:00:30.745 --> 00:00:33.050
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm
&gt;&gt; We should fix this.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.870
And the engineers said, that's not a
problem, people don't actually do that.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.090
Right, because engineers are smart.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.090
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.910
&gt;&gt; And designers said,
we've seen people do this.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.380
This is a big problem,
we should fix this.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.170
And engineers go, all right,
we'll put it in the backlog,

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.880
which means they never
actually get around to it.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.650
And so the designers went back to the
users, and did a bunch more user tests,

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.100
and recorded the users and took video
of the users having this problem and

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.349
then saying, what just happened?

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:06.080
This is so confusing.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.860
And then strung,

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.540
I think it was like 30 to 50 of
these users having this problem in

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.940
a row together, sat all the engineers in
a conference room and played the video.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.940
And when you're sitting
In a conference room

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.080
watching a video of real people have
real problems with your product,

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.840
it's a lot harder to ignore those
problems than if it's just some person

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.960
saying they saw somebody maybe
have a problem with this once.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.770
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; So

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.750
moral of the story,
take video, show it to people.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.786
It's the most powerful
communication tool you have.

00:01:35.786 --> 00:01:36.481
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:36.481 --> 00:01:37.595
Thank you.

00:01:37.595 --> 00:01:38.422
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
