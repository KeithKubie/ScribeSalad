00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440
MALE SPEAKER: Good afternoon,
everyone.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.890
And we're excited to have
you all here for another

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.700
Outstanding Authors
at Google Event.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.345
And today we're going to
dispatch with the formalities

00:00:09.345 --> 00:00:11.080
and get straight to the point.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.070
Robert Green is here to talk
about his new book, "Mastery,"

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.500
so this is what happens after
you get the 10,000 hours, you

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.470
get the 20,000 until
once you're a

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.980
true expert at something.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.730
What does that mean, and
how you get there?

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.580
So Robert will lead us along
that path, and we'll also have

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.080
time for some Q&amp;A at the end.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.200
So please join me in welcoming
Robert to Google.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.602
Thanks.

00:00:31.602 --> 00:00:35.850
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.390
ROBERT GREENE: Thank you.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.640
I've been a huge admirer of your
company for many years.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.330
I've blogged about it, I've
compared Google to the French

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.410
Revolution at Napoleon
Bonaparte, and your

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.020
competitors to the Prussians.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.620
So you can imagine that I'm
deeply honored and very happy

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.710
to be here.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.840
My talk is about creativity.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.050
I have a lot of, I
hope, practical

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.025
information to convey.

00:01:04.025 --> 00:01:06.840
And I know how valuable your
time is, so please excuse me

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.980
if I dispense with any cute
anecdotes to begin, and I just

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.800
dive right into the
information part.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:21.330
Now, I'm sure that all of us,
or maybe most of us, have

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.540
encountered more or less
the following scenario.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:33.040
We have a problem to solve, a
project to create or direct.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.780
Along the way to completing
this project, at certain

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.600
junctures, we have to
make some decisions.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.160
We have to choose between A,
B, or C. Whether go in this

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.450
direction, over here,
or over here.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.180
We do the best we can based on
our knowledge and experience.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.210
But often after the work is
done, we have the sensation

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.460
that there's something
missing.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.340
That, perhaps, we could
have done it better.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.490
What if the answer or
the best decisions

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.560
involved D, E, and F?

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.900
Something that we never
even considered.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.160
What blocks or limits us from

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.570
considering these wider options?

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.600
We're all aware of great
historical figures who've

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.800
indeed demonstrated the ability
to consider D, E, F,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.020
and beyond.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.560
This is the source of their
incredibly creative power to

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.340
make uncanny discoveries or to
invent the kind of things that

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.300
change how we think and act.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.780
We see examples of such people
around us in the world today.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.580
What makes some people more,
seemingly more, creative and

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.290
imaginative than others?

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.530
Is it genetics, a matter of
luck, is it being born into a

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.390
great family, going to the
right school, et cetera?

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.230
Well, in my book, "Mastery," I
attempt to definitively answer

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.550
this question.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.590
I maintain that true creativity
comes through a

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.800
process that I describe in
great detail in my book.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.300
To summarize it as briefly as
possible, this process begins

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:26.380
with the critical first step
of choosing which field or

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.130
subject to pursue.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.390
Creative people are those who
opt for career paths that mess

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.560
with their deepest interests
and inclinations.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.530
They feel a deep personal need
to discover something about

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.890
the world, to solve a problem
that perplexes them, to invent

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.520
something that's simply
not there.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:54.280
Feeling personally engaged and
motivated in their work, they

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.390
focus more, they learn faster,
they're more patient and

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.130
persistent than other people.

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.800
Having begun on the right career
path, the first step.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.990
The next step is to go through
an effective apprenticeship,

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.180
absorbing all of the rules and
standard procedures in your

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.030
field and accumulating the
maximum amount of skills.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.720
Now, I believe we all go through
an apprenticeship

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.959
phase of one sort or another.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.890
And, at a certain point in this
phase, we reach a kind of

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.360
turning point or crossroads.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.860
Either our minds will become
active and experimental with

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.310
the knowledge that we have
accumulated, in which case we

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.160
will slowly awaken
creative energy.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.630
Or we will become prisoners
of that knowledge.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.230
We remain conservative and
conventional, our minds just

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.280
simply rotating between
A, B, or C.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.930
Well, masters are those who
take the first path.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.780
And after years of generating
creative energy, they reach a

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.170
point where they
have a complete

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.030
feel for their subject.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.380
They have internalized it,
they have mastered it.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.390
They can see all the way to
the end of the alphabet.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.330
So, in my talk today I want
to focus exclusively on

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.160
creativity.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.600
And moving past that
ABC syndrome that

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.750
stymies so many of us.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.610
I'm going to be assuming that
many or most of you have

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.420
chosen career paths that mesh
with your deepest interests,

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.830
that you've gone through
or nearly finished the

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.000
apprenticeship phase, having
absorbed the necessary

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.360
knowledge and accumulated
an array of skills.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.580
You're perhaps poised at that
turning point in which your

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.650
minds could take the path
towards greater creative

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.590
energy or you could settle for
the conventional route, never

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.340
being aware of how that
settling is occurring.

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.590
My goal in my talk
today is twofold.

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:05.250
I want to convince you that the
human brain is a naturally

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.590
creative instrument.

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.680
It is designed for making
connections between ideas, for

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.640
envisioning DEF and beyond.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.630
It wants to go in
that direction.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.850
Creativity is not a function
of some freakish genetic

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.710
wiring that occurs in the
brains of a few people.

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.640
It is instead the function of
awakening and exploiting the

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.360
natural creative energy
we all possess.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.410
Second, I want to show you what
prevents many of us from

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:41.390
taking this path towards greater
creative energy, how

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.035
we blocked and inhibit
ourselves.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:51.570
In doing so, I'm going to be
revealing to you certain

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.340
strategies that highly creative
people, past and

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.850
present, have used to move past
these blocks and awaken

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.070
that natural energy.

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:04.590
My hope is that I will plant a
seed in your brain, that the

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:09.370
ability to go past ABC is
already there, and with a few

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.510
gentle indications of the right
direction you'll find

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:14.890
your way there on your own,
if you haven't already

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.340
found your way there.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:23.540
But before I discuss these
ideas, I want to involve you

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.980
in a very short and
simple exercise.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:29.340
It's going to seem kind of
moronic, but the purpose of it

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.080
will become clear soon enough.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.920
I'm going to be asking all of
you to close your eyes, and

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.470
for the space of a
minute to try to

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.730
completely empty your minds.

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:44.900
Have no conscious thoughts,
no mental

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:48.530
images, go totally blank.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:53.290
See if you can do this, and
what happens if you can't.

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:54.860
I'm going to time it.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.580
A little gong will go off to
indicate that the minute is

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:00.300
up, and then we'll discuss.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:01.310
OK?

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:03.720
So, prepare yourselves
for a moment.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:06.780
It's going to be completely
silent.

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:07.680
OK.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.261
Close your eyes.

00:08:10.261 --> 00:08:11.511
And begin.

00:08:15.072 --> 00:08:24.010
[GONG SOUNDING]

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:25.260
Very good.

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:29.610
OK.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:33.690
How many of you were able to
experience total emptiness,

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:37.200
not a single mental image during
that entire minute?

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.860
Come on, how many?

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.470
You were?

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:42.520
Are you a Zen master
or something?

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:47.420
That's very good.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:50.530
For the majority of you who
couldn't, did any of you

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:55.030
experience something like the
following scenario, where an

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:59.482
image will suddenly pop up in
your mind of a person that you

00:08:59.482 --> 00:09:03.940
know, and that will lead to an
event that is associated with

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:07.210
that person, and that event
will then lead to the

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:09.700
[INAUDIBLE] image of another
person associated with that

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.170
event, on and on and on.

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:13.180
Any kind of links like
that going on in

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:15.860
your brains, anybody?

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.820
Uh huh.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.470
You don't have to share it
with us, I want you to

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:24.310
embarrass yourself or anything,
but where did these

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:25.370
images come from?

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:29.450
Were you somehow consciously
controlling them in any way?

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:31.410
AUDIENCE: It was stuff
on my to do list.

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:33.390
ROBERT GREENE: There was stuff
from your to do list.

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:34.260
Right.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.760
But were you consciously calling
them up or did they

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.546
just come to you?

00:09:39.546 --> 00:09:42.324
AUDIENCE: They just
filled the void.

00:09:42.324 --> 00:09:44.640
ROBERT GREENE: Are these things
that come up in your

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.110
mind totally random, or is there
some sort of apparent

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:49.696
logic to it?

00:09:49.696 --> 00:09:52.740
Are they just totally random
images from anywhere?

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:53.990
AUDIENCE: I think the logic
is [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:57.525 --> 00:09:58.920
ROBERT GREENE: Right.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.350
But it's not the logic that
you have in your conscious

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:03.551
daily life, right?

00:10:03.551 --> 00:10:05.130
OK.

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:07.990
I happen to practice a form
of Zen meditation.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:10.125
I do it 30 minutes every
morning religiously.

00:10:10.125 --> 00:10:13.940
I've been doing it for close
to three years now.

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:18.890
And even after that much
practice, I've noticed that

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:22.400
it's nearly impossible for me
to still the conscious mind

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.710
for more than a few minutes.

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:28.910
Images keep bubbling up to the
surface which lead to all

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:32.080
different kinds of chains
of connections.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.600
The deeper I go into my
meditation and the more I'm

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.740
able to somewhat still the
conscious mind, the more

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:44.140
bizarre and seemingly random
these associations are.

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:48.060
Well, the reason I had you do
this simple exercise is to

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:51.420
illustrate what I consider the
basic principle about the

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:53.060
human brain.

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:57.250
Its natural state is one
of constant motion and

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:58.910
association.

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:01.850
It's like a smooth ball bearing
at the top of an

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:05.600
endless incline, unless it is
obstructed, unless it is made

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.320
still, it will just keep
rolling and rolling and

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.700
rolling until the day we die.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:14.450
It moves in constantly
shifting chains of

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:19.180
connections, between ideas,
sensations, and memories,

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:22.870
equally what we call the stream
of consciousness.

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:26.890
The human brain is a dual
processing system in which any

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:30.500
piece of information or
perception is instantly

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:34.380
compared to another one in our
short or long term memory.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.860
To generate a sense of pattern
and continuity, or to take

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:41.310
notice of things that don't
fit into these patterns.

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:46.710
The brain functions through
comparison and association.

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:51.030
If we are tired or about to
fall asleep, or even if we

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:55.430
dream, we can suddenly become
aware of the most bizarre

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:58.950
associations that are going on,
as if the brain were doing

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:04.400
this on auto pilot below the
level of consciousness.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:09.270
In our daily conversations we
might make some joke or witty

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.620
remark that is connected
to something that

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.050
somebody just said.

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:18.370
This connection, the source of
our joke or witticism would be

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:21.470
impossible for us to trace
back because it occurs so

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:25.110
naturally and so rapidly.

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:28.810
Our conversations themselves
reflect this basic pattern.

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:33.750
Endlessly shifting angles and
chains of connection building

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:36.370
on what other people say.

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:39.160
Well this is the brain
in its pure form.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.360
Never stopping, always
connecting.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:46.590
And by the way, that's sort of
why I think the internet is so

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:48.020
addictive and engaging.

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.150
It reflects this basic
pattern of the

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:51.840
brain on a global scale.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.310
It's like a global brain.

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:58.990
But this is so incredibly
natural to us.

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:01.090
We only have to look
at children.

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:06.630
Almost Instantly, acquiring a
basic vocabulary, at the age

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:10.430
of three, they'll begin to
make the most interesting

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:14.100
associations between
words and ideas.

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:18.220
Their drawings can also bring
together the most unexpected

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:21.650
and imaginative connections.

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:24.940
In my book I call this mind
that children possess,

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:28.880
"original mind." It is
marked by incredible

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:33.220
fluidity and openness.

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:35.950
But children do not create great
works of art, and they

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:38.880
do not invent significant pieces
of technology, and they

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.810
don't make discoveries
about the world.

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:44.930
And neither do we when we
daydream, or dream, or make a

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:49.210
joke, or change the subject
of a conversation.

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:53.700
These are all examples of what I
call "low-level creativity."

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.800
Exhibiting the natural
associating power

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.890
of the human brain.

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:03.540
But let us add to this natural
associating power of the human

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:05.800
brain, something else.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:12.400
Years of study, practice, and
experiment within a field.

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:18.310
With all of this experience, a
great deal of knowledge is

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:21.720
stored in our long-term
memory.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:25.860
The brain has a much larger
range of information that it

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:27.110
has access to.

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:31.060
Much larger than anything
a child could play with.

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:35.200
With all of this accumulated
knowledge and experience, the

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:39.330
mind can roam about in this
vastly expanded cognitive

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:43.840
space making all kinds of novel,
insightful associations

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:48.180
between ideas over here,
and ideas over there.

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.990
What we call creativity is
nothing more than the ability

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:56.340
that some people cultivate to
search wider, to imagine more

00:14:56.340 --> 00:15:00.190
possibilities, to imagine more
connections, to associate what

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:03.010
has never been associated
before.

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:08.800
Namely, to go beyond
the A, B, and C.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.150
As an example of what I'm
talking about, I want to look

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:14.750
at a particular discovery by
one of the most creative

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:18.430
scientists who's ever lived,
the 19th century scientist

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:21.310
Louis Pasteur.

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:27.700
Pasteur was trained as a chemist
and mineralogist, but

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.760
later in his career he became
fascinated with the subject of

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:33.530
germs and bacteria.

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:37.770
He studied them for years,
elaborating a radical new

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:40.670
theory on how germs are created
and the role that they

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:44.230
play in disease.

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:48.060
After decades of study and
experiment on this field in

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:52.200
his late 50s, he decided to
investigate the deadly disease

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.910
of cholera.

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:57.350
He wanted to figure out how
these germs operate, and what

00:15:57.350 --> 00:16:00.000
makes them so fatal.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.390
As part of his research, he
injected chickens with cholera

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:08.380
and he observed how the
disease progressed.

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:11.350
He needed to abandon work on
these experiments over one

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:15.130
summer, but when he came back
to his lab he resumed them.

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:18.620
And he once again injected some
cholera into a group of

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:23.760
chickens, which we shall
call group A chickens.

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:27.140
These chickens fell ill, but to
Pasteur's surprise, all of

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:29.720
them survived.

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:33.210
He surmised that the batch of
cholera that he had injected

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:36.620
into them had become weakened
over the summer months.

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:40.490
And so he ordered a new, fresh
batch of cholera and he

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:42.910
proceeded to inject it once
again into the group A

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:46.190
chickens, and to a new
collection of chickens which

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:49.760
we shall call group
B chickens.

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:53.200
All of the group B chickens
died, and all of the group A

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.910
chickens survived.

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:58.360
Now this phenomenon, which occur
totally by coincidence,

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.550
it wasn't the purpose of his
experiment, this phenomenon

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:04.230
had been noticed before.

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:07.700
Over 100 years prior to
Pasteur's experiment, it had

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:13.020
been the practice to inject
people with cow pox in order

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:17.440
to prevent an outbreak
of smallpox.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.430
But nobody understood how or
why this worked, and it was

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:24.040
simply limited to this
one disease.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.940
When Pasteur's group A chickens
survived, news of

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:30.310
this incident came to all of
his eminent colleagues.

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:33.500
And they basically all reacted
in the same way.

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:36.760
Some of them said that the
difference between group A and

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:40.620
group B chickens was merely a
coincidence, and that a larger

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.420
sampling would reveal this.

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:46.470
Still others ascribed the
differences to what the

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:49.940
chickens had been exposed
to in their environment.

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:52.240
A third group said they didn't
know how to explain it, maybe

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.670
there'd be an explanation
someday, but this simply

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:57.660
wasn't a significant enough
phenomenon to warrant any

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.840
special attention or
some new theory.

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.210
Well, Pasteur was different.

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:04.910
He'd studied germs so intensely
and much longer than

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:07.190
any of these other scientists.

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:10.680
He understood their complexity
and how their behavior of

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.970
these germs did not fit
into the simple

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:14.980
theories of his time.

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.770
He felt certain that the
difference between group A and

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:22.420
group B chickens represented
something truly significant.

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:25.970
As he pondered what had happened
in his laboratory, he

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:29.970
entertained the wild,
seemingly irrational

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:35.420
possibility that one set of
weakened germs still in the

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:39.830
bodies of group A chickens could
potentially fight off

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:42.790
another form of the
same germs.

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:45.730
In other words, germs, illness,

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:48.560
fighting against illness.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:51.070
Pasteur, in other words, had
connected two pieces of

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:52.670
knowledge, of information,
that had never

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:56.230
been connected before.

00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:59.170
We might take this concept
totally for granted, but

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:02.880
decades before the discovery
of antibodies, this

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:06.890
represented, this idea of germs
killing germs, illness

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:10.660
fighting illness, represented
an incredible lead of

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:12.100
imagination.

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:15.870
A leap that was made possible
by simply the fact that

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:19.860
Pasteur was willing and able
to entertain more possible

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:23.450
theories and interpretations
than any of his fellow

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:25.270
colleagues.

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:27.750
Naturally, after entertaining
this hypothesis, he

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:29.200
worked to verify it.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:32.445
And he then thereby created
the science of immunology.

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:38.040
Well, this is an example of
what I call "high-level

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:43.840
creativity." it is a function
of two critical elements.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:48.550
First, a great deal of knowledge
that is stored and

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:51.490
organized in our long
term memory.

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:55.880
And second, the willingness
and ability to roam freely

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.850
through all of that knowledge.

00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:02.890
This second quality is what we
might call fluidity of mind.

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:07.440
We notice this fluidity if we've
had a few drinks, or we

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.750
take some drugs, or we saw
smoke some pot, or we're

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:12.000
feeling extremely tired.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.720
Suddenly, it seems as if doors
are opened up, and our minds

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.960
can move about more freely, and
they can come upon ideas,

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:23.000
interesting ideas, that
eluded us before.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.030
Well, highly creative people do
not need this extra bit of

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:28.770
stimulation.

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:34.020
They have managed to retain or
rediscover that fluid original

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:38.470
mind of the child, and wedded
it to all of this knowledge

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:42.830
and experience, giving them what
I call the "dimensional

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:46.910
mind." A mind capable of seeing
more dimensions of the

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:51.420
visible and invisible
world around us.

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:56.030
High-level creativity requires
these two elements.

00:20:56.030 --> 00:21:00.300
If you have an open and fluid
mind, but not enough knowledge

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:03.240
and experience, you will
basically remain on the level

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.750
of a child.

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:08.260
If you have a lot of knowledge
and experience, but your mind

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:11.890
is tight and unwilling to roam,
you will come up with

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:16.040
the same conventional responses,
the same A, B, and

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:19.680
C, like Pasteur's colleagues.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.700
Well, highly creative
people have both.

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:24.590
They have the knowledge and
the experience, plus the

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:28.830
mental fluidity which gives them
the ability to see more

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:32.250
possibilities in the world
around them and to maximize,

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:36.040
to realize to its fullest, the
natural connecting power of

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:38.280
the human brain.

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:42.900
The great psychologist Carl
Jung, he called this "serious

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:47.810
play." The combination of the
playful exploratory spirit of

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:51.090
the child, with the
serious tasks and

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:52.435
experience of the adult.

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:59.770
Now let me engage in a little
metaphor, or a symbol to sort

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:04.470
of explain more fully the idea
I'm elaborating here.

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:08.130
Imagine a relatively
small circle.

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:12.590
This circle represents what we
know of our field when we

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:15.530
begin our apprenticeship.

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:20.600
As we proceed and accumulate
knowledge and experience, this

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:27.050
circle keep slowly expanding,
increasing the cognitive space

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:29.630
within which we can
explore and make

00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:32.670
connections between ideas.

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:36.690
But as this base expands,
we confront a

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:40.610
paradox and a challenge.

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:44.860
Part of our apprenticeship
involves learning the rules,

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:48.610
the standard operating
procedures, and the paradigms

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:51.480
that prevail in our field.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:55.690
It also involves learning how to
work with other people, how

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:58.820
to fit into the group ethos.

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:02.460
When we begin work on a project
we feel the pressure,

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:06.980
conscious or unconscious, to
adhere to these rules and

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:09.630
paradigms, to follow
the procedures that

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:11.560
other people follow.

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.150
To break these rules and
conventions would

00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:16.830
entail a lot of risk.

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:19.555
Probably a lot of criticism, and
certainly a lot more work.

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:26.920
All of this tends to limit what
we consider and imagine.

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:30.860
Instead of exploring that
expanding cognitive space, we

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:34.720
unconsciously hold ourselves to
those A, B's, and C's that

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.680
we have assimilated.

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:41.090
We've become consummate
insiders, strict adherers to

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:44.120
the rules and paradigms
in our field.

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:46.350
Ideas in different parts
of our cognitive

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:49.200
space are never connected.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:52.180
If we're not careful,
this establishes a

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:54.670
momentum of its own.

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:58.070
Once we turn conservative and
defensive with our knowledge,

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:01.210
it becomes increasingly more
difficult to move in the

00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:03.440
opposite direction.

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:06.620
Furthermore, the mind, like
any muscle, tends to

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:09.440
tighten with age.

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:12.740
This is why, in the history
of science and great

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:15.940
technological innovation, so
many of the most significant

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:19.480
discoveries of our people who
are relatively young, or who

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:24.220
are outsiders to the field,
or who are both.

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:27.180
This is the paradox.

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:30.070
In order to have high-level
creativity, we have to

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:32.070
assimilate a great deal
of knowledge.

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:35.360
And that knowledge includes
rules and paradigms and

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.140
conventions which make
us conservative.

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:48.240
Highly creative people learn
the value of moving against

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:53.420
this conservative tendency by
making their minds experiment

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:58.090
and explore with their
increasing knowledge.

00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:00.560
Emerging from their
apprenticeships they may begin

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:04.330
this on a relatively small
scale, but they slowly

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:09.600
rediscover the original fluid
spirit of the child.

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:14.880
They adopt certain strategies
to force the mind out of its

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:19.000
conventional and conservative
and defensive positions.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.520
They learn how to loosen and
return the mind to its

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:23.860
original fluidity.

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:26.700
Instead of narrowing what they
consider as they get older,

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:31.950
they find a way to continually
expand their horizons.

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:35.540
I want to focus now on these
creative strategies that I've

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:36.600
just mentioned.

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:41.560
They form a large part of
chapter five in "Mastery." I

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:46.120
want to focus on these
strategies in the form of four

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:50.550
simple exercises that I believe
if you adopt somehow

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:54.910
in your practice they will
slowly loosen up the mind and

00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:58.310
push it in this direction that
I'm talking about of greater

00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:00.710
creative energy.

00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:02.980
These exercises are
the following.

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:06.090
Cultivate negative capability.

00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:08.710
Think like an outsider.

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:11.310
Use active imagination.

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:14.490
And finally, subvert your
patterns of thinking.

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:22.590
This first exercise, cultivate
negative capability, is the

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:24.310
most philosophical.

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:28.700
And it basically involves an
attitude, a way of looking at

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:32.650
the world, that will naturally
loosen up the mind.

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:36.310
The term negative capability
comes from the great early

00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:40.920
19th century poet and
writer John Keats.

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:44.550
Keats was struggling to
understand what makes one

00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:47.970
person like a William
Shakespeare so much more

00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:51.800
creative and imaginative
than another.

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:55.870
In his opinion, fear
and anxiety play

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:58.900
a determining role.

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:02.790
When we are physically
frightened by something in our

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:05.490
environment we have
a particular

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:08.180
physiological response.

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:12.030
Our minds naturally narrow
their focus onto what is

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:15.710
immediately present,
preparing us for a

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:18.390
fight or flight response.

00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:22.190
Well, something similar happens,
although more subtly,

00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:25.570
in the intellectual realm.

00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:28.950
Where we are confronted with
new problems or set of

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:33.950
circumstances, or when we begin
work on a project, we

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:40.170
are unconsciously plagued by
insecurities and anxieties,

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:42.800
and we don't like this.

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:47.470
Mysteries, any apparent
contradiction, situations that

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:51.220
are unfamiliar and ambiguous
and elude immediate

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:55.900
understanding, all of this
makes us uneasy.

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:59.950
Under these circumstances, we
are in a rush to come to a

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:03.380
conclusion, to make
a judgment, to

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:07.330
explain what is happening.

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:10.970
Being able to make a judgment
or explain what is happening

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:15.100
soothes our insecurities and
anxieties, makes us feel

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:16.600
confident and consistent.

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:20.070
We can express an opinion
before other people.

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:24.470
In this way, our egos become
enmeshed in our creative work,

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:28.730
in our interpretations
of the world.

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:32.560
Think of how difficult it is for
us to admit that we don't

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:35.420
know an answer, or that
we were wrong on

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:37.880
a particular issue.

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:41.980
Admitting that we don't know or
that we were wrong, should

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:46.500
be a sign of intelligence, of
a questioning nature, of a

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:50.450
willingness to reassess
our own ideas.

00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:54.560
Instead of that, we will hold
onto our ideas with double the

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:58.170
tenacity if ever we are made to
feel doubtful or insecure

00:28:58.170 --> 00:28:59.960
about them.

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:04.710
Well mysteries, uncertainties,
anything ambiguous, it all has

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:08.440
a similar effect upon us as a
physically frightening set of

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:09.760
circumstances.

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:16.390
The mind tightens and narrows
its focus, a fearful reaction.

00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:19.780
According to Keats, the
Shakespeare's of the world,

00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:23.750
the highly creative types,
cultivate what he calls

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:27.820
"negative capability."
They can negate the

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:31.030
ego and it's anxieties.

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:35.370
They are not in a rush to come
to a conclusion about the

00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:39.020
world or any new phenomenon.

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:43.090
They are completely open to
entertaining this idea or that

00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:46.510
idea at the same time, while
continuing to observe what's

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:49.000
going on around them.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.830
They can look at ambiguous or
contradictory evidence and not

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:58.140
be disturbed or feel the need
to explain them away.

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:03.080
This ability to withstand what
seems mysterious, to manage

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:07.380
the lack of knowing something
with certainty, is the primary

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:13.430
quality of all creative people
no matter their profession.

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:17.270
Because they feel less anxious
and in need to rush to a

00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:21.560
conclusion, they consider more
possibilities when confronted

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:24.930
with a problem which allows for
greater possibilities, a

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:31.100
greater range of connections
and creative associations.

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:34.370
Let me give you two examples
of negative capability in

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:39.260
action, one in the arts and
the other in the sciences.

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:41.620
The first example involves
Wolfgang

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:45.370
Amadeus Mozart, the composer.

00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:48.440
At a somewhat advanced part
in his career after he was

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:52.510
famous, Mozart suddenly
discovered the music of Johann

00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:54.410
Sebastian Bach.

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:58.180
And in looking at Bach's
elaborate counterpoint, he

00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:02.910
realized that this represented a
diametrically different, and

00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:06.300
even superior form of
music to his own.

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:09.050
At least in its complexity.

00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:13.990
Now, the reaction that most
composers have would be to

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:17.860
emotionally close them self off
from any uncertainty or

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:22.720
doubts about their own music,
and to assert their own ideas

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:26.320
and to make themselves imagine
that the music of Bach

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:30.550
represented something old
fashioned or irrelevant.

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:34.840
But Mozart possessed negative
capability.

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:39.290
He could look at two
diametrically opposing forms

00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:43.900
of music at the same time
and not feel anxious.

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:48.020
He could explore them and try to
synthesize the differences

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:50.030
between them.

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:53.860
He decided to spend a year
intensely studying Bach's

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:57.140
counterpoint and finding a way
to incorporate it, which he

00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:00.890
later did with his operas,
creating a whole new style

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:04.720
that revolutionized
music in the West.

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:09.330
In physics, at a very early age,
at the age of 16, Albert

00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:14.420
Einstein was struck by the
paradox in the following

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:17.380
thought experiment.

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:20.710
A man standing on earth looking
at a light beam and

00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:24.990
the sky, and another man
theoretically moving at the

00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:28.950
speed of light alongside that
light beam in the sky, that

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:32.860
both people would see that light
in exactly the same way

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:35.590
in exactly the same form.

00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:39.010
That is what Maxwell's law on
the absolute speed of light

00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:42.860
necessitated, but how
could it be so?

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:46.850
Certainly somebody moving at the
speed of light would see

00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:49.370
that light before it could
travel far enough

00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:50.830
to appear as light.

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:52.220
In other words, he
would see it as

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:54.890
electromagnetic particles.

00:32:54.890 --> 00:33:01.300
Well, for 10 long laborious
years, Einstein thought only

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:04.150
of this paradox and thought
experiment.

00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:08.060
Without straining for quick
answers or simple conclusions,

00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:11.230
in a complete state of
negative capability,

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:15.390
considering every possibility,
until it finally bore fruit

00:33:15.390 --> 00:33:18.740
with his theory of the
relativity in time and space.

00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:22.160
The special theory
of relativity.

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:25.040
What possessing negative
capability will do for you is

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:28.400
help you push past the
impatience and the anxiety

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:31.740
that make you come to
conclusions too early on in

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:33.590
the process.

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:36.050
Here's how you could potentially
adopt negative

00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:38.050
capability in your life.

00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:42.810
First, you practice it on
a micro daily level.

00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:46.400
In your personal relationships,
you counter the

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:50.740
tendency that we all have to
label and categorized the

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:54.050
people that we encounter,
the people around us.

00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:57.840
Your goal is to judge these
people much less and to

00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:00.890
observe them more.

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:03.940
People are infinitely complex
and they never fit into the

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:07.400
little categories that we
have of their behavior.

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:11.510
Your goal is to move inside
their prospective, try to see

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:14.409
the world from their point of
view, to get a more nuanced

00:34:14.409 --> 00:34:17.100
and individualized sense
of who they are.

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:20.719
This will instantly make you
less anxious, less judgmental,

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:22.920
and more perceptive.

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:26.580
Now, you apply this
to your work.

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:31.310
Before you begin on a project, I
know it's difficult, but you

00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:35.550
throw out as many assumptions
as possible.

00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:38.800
It may be difficult, but you
open yourself up to other

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:41.719
possible theories,
interpretations.

00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:43.790
The kinds of interpretations
and theories that you never

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:46.480
usually entertain.

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:49.570
You speculate and think about
the information in front of

00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:54.270
you, but you control that
constant desire to rush to

00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:56.830
some sort of conclusion.

00:34:56.830 --> 00:35:00.200
Third, and finally, you
learn to embrace

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.530
uncertainty and chaos.

00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:05.080
Life is inherently chaotic
and it doesn't fit

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:07.150
into our tidy formulas.

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:10.790
Not only does this not make
you anxious, but you find

00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:16.080
chaos and uncertainty deeply
exciting and stimulating.

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:20.810
Slowly adopting this as an
overall philosophy will

00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:23.340
naturally loosen the
mind up and give it

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:25.290
greater creative flow.

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:28.090
You will naturally consider
more options and

00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:31.010
possibilities.

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:35.220
The second exercise, think like
an outsider, is related

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:40.670
to a notable phenomenon in the
history of creativity.

00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:44.160
Some of the most important
discoveries, inventions, and

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:48.180
innovations within a field
come from people who are

00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:51.440
trained in a much different
field, and who have an

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:54.020
outsider's approach.

00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:56.960
Louis Pasteur was a classic
example of this.

00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:00.350
He was trained as a chemist
and mineralogist, so he

00:36:00.350 --> 00:36:04.920
brought a much different way of
thinking to the subject of

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:07.260
medicine and germs,
a method that was

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:08.510
infinitely more creative.

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:13.490
Albert Einstein was a
complete outsider.

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:16.440
His two most important
discoveries came when he was

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:18.990
working at the Swiss
patent office.

00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:22.700
Google itself exemplifies
this idea.

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:25.540
It is, perhaps, the most
successful business on the

00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:28.810
planet founded by two men who
are relatively complete

00:36:28.810 --> 00:36:32.080
outsiders to business and who,
therefore, structured and

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:34.510
directed their company
in a very novel

00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:35.880
and creative fashion.

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:38.540
I could go on and on and on with
this list, including many

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:41.130
great artists.

00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:44.670
There are two important
reasons why outsiders

00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:48.460
generally have a creative
advantage.

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:52.400
First, they are less steeped
in and burdened by the

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:55.680
conventions of the field that
they are attacking.

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:58.540
They ask a different
set of questions.

00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:03.760
They approach problems from
unconventional angles.

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:07.140
And second, they are often
trained in totally unrelated

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:11.270
fields, and so can make
interesting and creative

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:14.610
connections between two very
different forms of thinking,

00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:18.510
like science and business, or
chemistry and medicine, or

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:21.700
engineering and design.

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:26.090
Now, we can't all consciously
follow such a path.

00:37:26.090 --> 00:37:29.470
But even within the careers that
we're pursuing, we can

00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:33.290
train ourselves to think like
outsiders and help loosen up

00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:36.500
the mind in the process.

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:41.980
A great example of this would be
somebody that I interviewed

00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:43.860
and profiled in my book.

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:46.840
A contemporary master, her
name is Yoky Matsuoka.

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:53.040
Yoky was one of the original
heads of innovation for the

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:54.700
Google X project.

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:58.140
She is now the senior
vice-president in charge of

00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:03.020
technology at Nest Labs here
in Silicon Valley.

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:06.400
She was trained as a electrical
engineer and

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:07.780
roboticist.

00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:13.190
And early in her career she was
asked to help design the

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:17.770
hand of a full scale robot that
was being developed at

00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:22.760
the MIT robotics lab where
she was getting her Ph.D.

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:25.790
Now, in the past, all of our
fellow engineers basically

00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:27.830
attacked this idea of
designing such a

00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:30.540
hand in the same way.

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:33.960
They would place in this hand
all sorts of very cleverly

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:36.210
built motors that would
give the hand

00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:39.030
maximum grasping power.

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:41.800
They would load most of these
motors in the palm, because

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:44.300
that's where there was
the most space.

00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:47.510
But in packing the palm with
all of these motors, they

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:51.380
would render it completely
inflexible and so this hand

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:55.220
could not make even the most
simple grasping maneuvers.

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:58.070
These hardware engineers would
then fob off their design to

00:38:58.070 --> 00:39:01.150
software engineers hoping that
they could program back in the

00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:05.050
flexibility that
they had lost.

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:08.180
Hardware engineers are trained
to think in a certain way.

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:11.610
They're trying to focus on the
mechanical and technical

00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:15.310
aspects of a problem and stay
within that circle.

00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:18.210
To speculate, to think of
something wider or larger,

00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:21.120
would be too unconventional
and would require too much

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:23.630
work and effort.

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:27.040
Well, Yoky decided on a much
different approach.

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:31.310
Thinking like an outsider, she
asked the kinds of questions

00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:34.550
that other engineers ignored.

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:38.720
She wondered about what made
the hand so dexterous and

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:40.180
powerful in the first place.

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:43.860
How did it evolved into
being so powerful.

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:48.500
What is the role played by the
palm in grasping objects and

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:51.890
how does it work in tandem
with the thumb.

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:57.300
Asking these larger questions
made her extend her research

00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:01.490
to biology, neuroscience,
evolution,

00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:04.560
biomechanics, and so on.

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:08.040
She decided to build an
elaborate model of the hand

00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:12.440
itself including all of the tiny
bones in the knuckles.

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:15.990
In the process, she learned
the importance of having a

00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:19.700
rounded, flexible palm, and the
role that certain bones

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:23.000
play in grasping objects.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.370
Now, all of your fellow
engineers scoffed at her

00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:31.450
method, and the apparent waste
of time that it represented.

00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:35.550
In the end, however, her
outsider approach led to many

00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:38.280
more creative decisions.

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:42.150
For instance, she decided to
keep the palm rounded and

00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:47.530
flexible and place motors in
different parts, substituting

00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:50.690
flexibility for power.

00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:55.960
In this way, her hand later on
became the industry standard

00:40:55.960 --> 00:41:00.280
for prosthetics, one that was
infinitely more lifelike an

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:02.620
effective for users
of this hand.

00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:06.470
Following this outsider
approach, Yoky was able to

00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:09.480
avoid the ABC syndrome and
that technical lock that

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:13.600
stymied all of her
other engineers.

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:17.010
To think like an outsider
requires basically two things.

00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:20.510
It basically means to take
advantage of any training that

00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:24.810
you have had in any unrelated
field which almost

00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:26.310
all of us have had.

00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:30.910
It also means to take advantage
of the incredible

00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:35.280
explosion of information that we
are now all have access to

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:39.180
and to expand your searches on
any project to seemingly

00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:41.450
unrelated fields.

00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:46.360
By applying what you know from a
different field and by using

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:50.740
this expanded research, you will
naturally absorbed and

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:53.060
use different patterns
of thinking.

00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:56.460
This will make you ask a
different set of questions

00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:58.250
before you begin your project.

00:41:58.250 --> 00:42:02.120
And asking a different set of
questions is almost half of

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:05.500
what it takes to be creative.

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:10.900
The third exercise, use
active imagination,

00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:14.600
is deceptively simple.

00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:20.300
Often, what separates creative
from conventional thinkers is

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:23.780
that they simply search wider.

00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:28.000
They use their minds to generate
possibilities that

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.430
others don't think of, then they
work to verify what they

00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:34.470
came up with.

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:38.310
We saw a classic example
of this with Pasteur.

00:42:38.310 --> 00:42:42.740
Another great example
is with Henry Ford.

00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:46.640
Early on in his career, in the
earliest years of what would

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:54.350
later become the Ford Motor
Company, Ford was anxious to

00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:57.290
speed up production of cars.

00:42:57.290 --> 00:43:01.540
He saw the automobile as the
ultimate consumer product.

00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:05.090
But in order for it to become
that, he had to greatly

00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:08.180
increase production rate
in his factory.

00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:11.420
So he spent a couple days
looking at his employees on

00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:14.290
the factory floor and trying
to imagine how he could get

00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:18.160
them to move faster
from car to car.

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:19.630
Suddenly, one day, he imagine

00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:21.425
something completely different.

00:43:21.425 --> 00:43:25.030
He imagined the men standing
still and the

00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:27.750
car's coming to them.

00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:29.640
He didn't know what that really
meant, but he decided

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:32.850
to try it out, and lo and
behold, it increased

00:43:32.850 --> 00:43:36.180
productivity by such an
incredible exponential rate

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:39.100
that it could now become the
consumer product that he

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:41.830
envisioned.

00:43:41.830 --> 00:43:46.010
Things like antibodies or
assembly lines, they seem so

00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:50.030
obvious to us now, but they're
never obvious in the present

00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:54.000
and they involve an incredible
leap of what I call "active

00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:00.010
imagination." The difference
between regular and active

00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:06.400
imagination is that the latter
is used consciously to reach

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:08.490
very, very practical results.

00:44:08.490 --> 00:44:11.170
It's not imagination for coming
up with wild things,

00:44:11.170 --> 00:44:15.570
it's imagination used for
very practical results.

00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:17.970
Think of the active imagination
as a kind of

00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:21.760
creative muscle that
you're developing.

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:24.290
First, within the loose
constraints of what you're

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:27.980
working on, you open your
mind up, you give a

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:29.860
complete free rein.

00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:33.950
You entertain almost every
possibility that you could

00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:36.450
imagine or visualize.

00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:41.420
You engage in what Charles
Darwin calls "fools

00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:47.500
experiments." this is the fun,
play part of serious play.

00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:52.670
You use notebooks, sketches,
diagrams, models, prototypes

00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:57.390
to help externalize the products
of your imagination.

00:44:57.390 --> 00:45:02.450
Once you have gone through this
you now enter the second,

00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:06.390
serious part of the process.

00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:09.870
First, you choose one or few
of the more promising

00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:13.090
possibilities that were
generated by your imagination.

00:45:13.090 --> 00:45:18.590
And now you actively work to
test, verify, or confirm it.

00:45:18.590 --> 00:45:23.820
This might entail launching a
beta version on the public.

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:27.740
Once you have feedback, now go
back into the first part of

00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:30.565
the process in a shortened form,
using your imagination

00:45:30.565 --> 00:45:34.020
to perhaps take what you have
into an even better and higher

00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:37.570
form, circling constantly
through this process in

00:45:37.570 --> 00:45:40.940
shorter and shorter cycles until
you've got something

00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:43.750
that's both incredibly
imaginative and incredibly

00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:46.890
realistic and practical.

00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:49.790
By developing this, by going
through this over and over and

00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:54.210
over again, you will develop
your imagination into an

00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:56.970
incredibly powerful
creative muscle.

00:45:59.710 --> 00:45:59.950
OK.

00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:00.780
I'm nearing the end.

00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:03.990
The fourth and final exercise
may be the most

00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:05.430
important in some ways.

00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:08.860
It's called "subverting your
patterns of thinking." And

00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:12.870
it's based on the idea that our
minds tend to fall into

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:17.470
certain habits, and patterns,
and grooves that severely

00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:21.260
limit what we consider
as possible.

00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:25.280
Well, creative people have the
ability to move against these

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:29.350
patterns, to actively subvert
them and thereby expand what

00:46:29.350 --> 00:46:32.380
they consider.

00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:37.670
One pattern that we often fall
into, and we're very rarely

00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:40.790
aware of it, is our
tendency to always

00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:43.610
focus on the end result.

00:46:43.610 --> 00:46:45.250
The finished product.

00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:47.420
How to make that product
as perfect

00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:50.050
and powerful as possible.

00:46:50.050 --> 00:46:53.750
We live in a goal oriented
culture.

00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:57.500
To see a contrast, we would have
to look at Asian cultures

00:46:57.500 --> 00:47:01.420
in which thinking about process,
and structure, and

00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:04.680
how the parts relate to the
whole, are given much more

00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:07.810
emphasis and importance.

00:47:07.810 --> 00:47:11.240
In a goal oriented culture, when
there is a set back or a

00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:16.050
glitch, we naturally focus
on the end result.

00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:19.240
So if, for instance, I'm writing
a book and the book

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:26.400
isn't coming out as I had
imagined, I will think about

00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:30.680
the ideas and my style of
writing and how I can improve

00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:33.660
these ideas and the
communication of them to give

00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:36.870
the book more wallop,
more effect.

00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:39.620
But often the source of the
problem is the structure of

00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:42.600
the damn book, the organization
of the chapters,

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:45.400
how one idea is linked
to another.

00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:48.770
So many books start off well
but completely fall apart

00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:51.560
because of faulty,
faulty structure.

00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:54.430
We can say the same thing
about businesses.

00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:57.790
The problem is in how the
products are produced, how the

00:47:57.790 --> 00:48:02.190
personnel in the company is
structured and organized, the

00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:06.190
decision making, the chain
of command, et cetera.

00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:09.930
Napoleon Bonaparte affected
the greatest revolution in

00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:14.090
military history by thinking
deeply about the structure of

00:48:14.090 --> 00:48:17.600
his army and how to organize it
so it could be faster and

00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:20.530
more fluid in the attack.

00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:24.170
Thinking about structure,
process, organization, they're

00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:25.470
not natural to us.

00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:28.900
But in making ourselves do it we
will naturally expand what

00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:32.550
we consider giving ourselves
more possible creative

00:48:32.550 --> 00:48:36.030
associations and connections.

00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:40.780
Another habit we fall into is
our tendency to be mesmerized

00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:45.570
by patterns themselves, by
trends, by paradigms, and by

00:48:45.570 --> 00:48:48.780
how all the information that
we're looking at somehow fits

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:52.100
into these patterns
and paradigms.

00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:56.200
Well, highly creative people
have the ability to look at

00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:59.280
what doesn't fit into patterns,
the anomalies that

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:01.830
cannot be assimilated.

00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:05.600
An example of this is
very close to home.

00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:10.550
In the 1990s the prevailing
paradigm in internet searches

00:49:10.550 --> 00:49:14.490
was established by companies
such as Alta Vista, which

00:49:14.490 --> 00:49:18.080
ranked searches according to how
many times a subject was

00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:21.680
referred to in an article.

00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:25.700
Now this worked reasonably well,
but sometimes it would

00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:31.090
yield the most bizarre and
incredibly unhelpful results.

00:49:31.090 --> 00:49:34.240
Almost everyone at that time
thought that this was a

00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:38.850
temporary glitch that would
eventually be ironed out.

00:49:38.850 --> 00:49:42.880
Well, while at Stanford, not so
very long ago, Sergey Brin

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:47.710
and Larry Page looked at these
anomalies themselves.

00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:51.010
And in pondering these anomalies
they came up with a

00:49:51.010 --> 00:49:54.980
much different form of search,
one that ranked according to

00:49:54.980 --> 00:49:59.040
links like citations in
a scientific journal.

00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:02.360
Thinking outside the prevailing
paradigm, they came

00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:07.550
up with a much more powerful and
creative form of search.

00:50:07.550 --> 00:50:10.920
Anomalies are incredibly
eloquent.

00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:16.080
They indicate new paths, trends,
ways of thinking,

00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:18.410
problems that should
not be ignored.

00:50:18.410 --> 00:50:20.940
Paying attention to anomalies
will naturally

00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:24.300
expand what we consider.

00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:29.940
Related to this pattern bias,
is our fixation on what is

00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:33.690
immediately present to
the eyes and minds.

00:50:33.690 --> 00:50:37.500
We focus on what has happened
in a set of circumstances as

00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:40.300
opposed to what didn't happen.

00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:42.730
Well, highly creative people
can think in an added

00:50:42.730 --> 00:50:47.060
dimension, that of the invisible
and the absent.

00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:49.260
An example of this way of
thinking, although in

00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:52.690
literature, is with
Sherlock Holmes.

00:50:52.690 --> 00:50:54.770
He was constantly thinking
like this.

00:50:54.770 --> 00:51:00.280
In the story Silver Blaze, for
instance, he figures out that

00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:03.590
the murder must have been
somebody that was very

00:51:03.590 --> 00:51:09.100
familiar to the victim because
the family dog did not bark in

00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:12.380
the presence of the murderer.

00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:15.650
Now, this way of thinking in the
real world led to one of

00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:17.710
the more radical
and interesting

00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:20.970
innovations in medicine.

00:51:20.970 --> 00:51:25.540
Prior to the 20th century,
doctors would only focus on

00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:28.630
germs and bacteria and dangerous
agents in the

00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:32.280
environment and how to protect
the body from them.

00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:34.790
Well, looking at the disease of
scurvy at the turn of the

00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:39.630
20th century, the scientist
Gowland Hopkins suddenly

00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:41.290
turned this around.

00:51:41.290 --> 00:51:43.560
Instead of thinking of the
germs that might be

00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:48.410
responsible for scurvy, he
looked at what was absent from

00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:49.170
the picture.

00:51:49.170 --> 00:51:54.490
What the body was not producing,
namely, vitamin C.

00:51:54.490 --> 00:51:57.390
Thinking in this way led to
a total revolution in our

00:51:57.390 --> 00:51:58.340
concept of health.

00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:01.850
It lead to vitamins and
preventive medicine.

00:52:01.850 --> 00:52:04.950
Thinking about what is absent,
what didn't happen, is a

00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:09.410
highly creative form
of thinking.

00:52:09.410 --> 00:52:15.250
Well, I've loaded you up, like
pack mules, with far too much

00:52:15.250 --> 00:52:16.840
information.

00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:18.890
I'm sorry about that.

00:52:18.890 --> 00:52:23.780
The good news is that almost
all of this information and

00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:27.270
even more, if you're a
masochist, is available in

00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:31.800
chapter five of my book,
"Mastery." I'm going to leave

00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:37.900
you with one final idea that
I believe encapsulates and

00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:41.430
conceptualize all of
this tonnage of

00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:43.460
material I've given you.

00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:46.470
And the idea is the following.

00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:50.800
Think of creativity as the
ultimate synthesis of the

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:53.840
child and the adult
within you.

00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:56.380
We carry both of these
within us.

00:52:56.380 --> 00:53:00.230
The child being the remnant of
our earliest years, when we

00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:05.270
were more imaginative and
exploratory and fluid.

00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:08.260
Now, normally, we keep the adult
and the child within us

00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:10.540
rigidly separated.

00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:15.920
We let the child out in our free
time, when we socialize,

00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:18.910
or go to parties, or watch
a movie, or play games or

00:53:18.910 --> 00:53:21.690
sports, or go on vacation.

00:53:21.690 --> 00:53:26.970
This is also when our minds are
freer, more fluid, maybe a

00:53:26.970 --> 00:53:28.440
little bit less productive,
but they're

00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:31.080
freer and more fluid.

00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:36.120
The adult dominates our work
world and our careers.

00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:39.530
This is also when our minds
become a lot tighter, as we

00:53:39.530 --> 00:53:43.130
try to fit into the narrow
role of business person,

00:53:43.130 --> 00:53:48.540
engineer, writer of self
help books, et cetera.

00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:52.390
By keeping the adult and the
child rigidly separated, we

00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:55.380
completely dry up any
creative potential

00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:58.310
that we want to have.

00:53:58.310 --> 00:54:03.120
The goal is to find a way to
distill and incorporate that

00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:07.020
playful, exploratory, fluid
spirit of the child into our

00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:09.560
disciplined, experienced,
work.

00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:12.530
It is not that we alternate
sometimes between the child

00:54:12.530 --> 00:54:16.820
here or the adult there, but
that we fuse the two together

00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:21.770
into one inseparable whole, that
whole being the creative

00:54:21.770 --> 00:54:23.400
individual.

00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:24.380
That's it.

00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:25.890
Thank you very much.

00:54:25.890 --> 00:54:27.780
Thank you for your patience.

00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:33.578
And I'll entertain any questions
that you might have.

00:54:33.578 --> 00:54:37.740
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:39.914
AUDIENCE: I have a question
with regards to emotional

00:54:39.914 --> 00:54:44.774
intelligence and how that's
related to creativity.

00:54:44.774 --> 00:54:48.176
I would think that the negative
capability is related

00:54:48.176 --> 00:54:52.008
to the capability of the person
to avoid the emotional

00:54:52.008 --> 00:54:56.868
part that tends to focus you
on solving the immediate

00:54:56.868 --> 00:54:59.784
problem, coming from your
emotional attachment

00:54:59.784 --> 00:55:01.242
[INAUDIBLE].

00:55:01.242 --> 00:55:05.380
ROBERT GREENE: Well, I was
limited to however long I have

00:55:05.380 --> 00:55:08.010
for this talk, but I do have a
whole thing in there about

00:55:08.010 --> 00:55:11.620
emotional intelligence and
the role that it plays in

00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:15.670
creativity, a whole section in
chapter five in the book.

00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:20.480
So for instance I talk about the
emotions that tend to get

00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:23.260
clogged and kind of tighten
us up so that we

00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:25.310
can't become creative.

00:55:25.310 --> 00:55:29.240
One of them being, for
instance, curiosity.

00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:33.010
We lose our sense of wonder and
curiosity as we get older.

00:55:33.010 --> 00:55:37.020
We tend to have the feeling
that we know everything.

00:55:37.020 --> 00:55:38.900
And this is extremely
dangerous.

00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:41.110
And it severely limits
what we consider.

00:55:41.110 --> 00:55:44.390
And negative capability is
basically very much related to

00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:46.640
that childlike feeling
of wonder.

00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:49.700
Children don't sit there going
around at the age of 6 feeling

00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:52.160
like, I know what that
cloud up there means.

00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:52.650
They don't.

00:55:52.650 --> 00:55:56.070
And they open themselves up to
all kinds of possibilities.

00:55:56.070 --> 00:56:01.020
So I go through a range of other
emotions that tend to

00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:03.980
attack us as we get older and
that severely tighten and

00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:04.970
limit the mind.

00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:08.800
And believe me, I cover
emotional intelligence.

00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:10.553
Yes, sorry.

00:56:10.553 --> 00:56:12.517
AUDIENCE: This question may
be more relevant to your

00:56:12.517 --> 00:56:14.481
[INAUDIBLE].

00:56:14.481 --> 00:56:17.918
So one thing I've noticed is
that a lot of these historical

00:56:17.918 --> 00:56:19.168
examples [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:29.020
modern innovators [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:32.621 --> 00:56:34.486
a group of people working
together that are all very

00:56:34.486 --> 00:56:37.776
creative and they all have a
bunch of different ideas of

00:56:37.776 --> 00:56:41.950
things we should varying, but
there's not [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:45.878
So what's your advice on
convincing a group that

00:56:45.878 --> 00:56:47.128
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:56:49.315 --> 00:56:51.810
ROBERT GREENE: Who are you
trying to convince, people

00:56:51.810 --> 00:56:53.225
within or without?

00:56:53.225 --> 00:56:57.185
AUDIENCE: Usually other people
within the same organization.

00:57:00.650 --> 00:57:03.620
ROBERT GREENE: So you're not
asking about-- he's asking

00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:09.670
about working in a group, like
most people do, and coming up

00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:13.340
with creative answers and trying
to convince others that

00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:14.610
your group has somehow
come up--

00:57:14.610 --> 00:57:17.795
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] --what
do you do when you have too

00:57:17.795 --> 00:57:22.040
many creative ideas and there's
not enough bandwidth

00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:24.790
to even experiment
with all of them?

00:57:24.790 --> 00:57:29.800
ROBERT GREENE: Well, normally,
I talk in the war book, "33

00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:32.240
Strategies of War," of the
dangers of group think.

00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:36.770
So hopefully in your
brainstorming sessions you're

00:57:36.770 --> 00:57:39.140
not getting the dangerous thing
known as group think.

00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:42.850
And what group think means is
that people tend to funnel

00:57:42.850 --> 00:57:46.010
their ideas into what they think
the heads of the company

00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:48.740
want to hear for political
reasons.

00:57:48.740 --> 00:57:52.690
Creativity is unconventional,
it's iconoclastic, it doesn't

00:57:52.690 --> 00:57:56.000
recognize rules or limits, so
hopefully you're not doing

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.320
what I just mentioned.

00:57:57.320 --> 00:58:00.400
If that's the case, you need an
adult, you need somebody in

00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:03.520
there who's doing for the
funneling process.

00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:07.280
It's like when I talked about
active imagination and it's as

00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:09.810
if you never went into the
second part of the process and

00:58:09.810 --> 00:58:12.750
you were only doing the first
part, which is imagining every

00:58:12.750 --> 00:58:15.590
possibility and never getting
to the point of testing and

00:58:15.590 --> 00:58:16.610
verifying it.

00:58:16.610 --> 00:58:19.380
The point of that testing and
verifying thing, I call it in

00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:21.720
the book it's like a cycle--

00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:24.640
I can't even remember-- a
current, that's slowly

00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:27.340
winnowing down your idea into
something practical.

00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:29.760
You need an adult or a person
within the group--

00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:31.320
I'm not meaning the
adult literally--

00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:34.760
but you need somebody in there
who's sort of directing this,

00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:37.950
and who can sort of make the
decisions between, this is not

00:58:37.950 --> 00:58:41.150
a reasonable idea, we need to
winnow this down and take

00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:44.290
three or four or five of
the most realistic

00:58:44.290 --> 00:58:45.400
of all of your ideas.

00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:48.510
If it's just every one for
themselves I don't know how

00:58:48.510 --> 00:58:49.940
you can necessarily
get around it.

00:58:49.940 --> 00:58:52.830
It's a structural problem.

00:58:52.830 --> 00:58:57.350
[APPLAUSE]
