00:00:00.767 --> 00:00:02.101
HELLO, TODAY
WE'RE GOING TO TALK

00:00:02.134 --> 00:00:06.939
ABOUT THE BASEBALL PITCHER
JIM ABBOTT.

00:00:06.972 --> 00:00:10.243
- CHEERS, MATT JONES.
- CHEERS.

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:12.278 line:0%
[bleep].

00:00:12.311 --> 00:00:15.581 line:0%
SO JIM ABBOTT
WAS BORN IN 1967,

00:00:15.614 --> 00:00:17.650 line:0%
BUT HE DIDN'T HAVE
A RIGHT HAND.

00:00:17.683 --> 00:00:20.420
AND SO WHEN HE WAS, LIKE,
FIVE OR SIX,

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:23.589
JIM WAS LIKE,
I WANT TO PLAY SPORTS.

00:00:23.622 --> 00:00:25.324
JIM'S DAD, MIKE,
IS LIKE,

00:00:25.357 --> 00:00:27.693
YOU SHOULD MAYBE THINK
ABOUT SOCCER.

00:00:27.726 --> 00:00:30.797
SOCCER IS A EUROPEAN SPORT
WITH FEET.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.932
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO USE YOUR HANDS.

00:00:32.965 --> 00:00:37.537
ACTUALLY THE ONLY RULE IN SOCCER
IS DON'T USE YOUR HANDS.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.507
AND JIM'S LIKE, NO, I'M NOT
A [bleep] EUROPEAN.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.711
I'M AN AMERICAN.
I WANT TO PLAY BASEBALL.

00:00:45.744 --> 00:00:47.513
HIS PARENTS LOVED HIM.

00:00:47.546 --> 00:00:51.417
THEY WERE LIKE, EVEN THOUGH
YOU CAN'T DO ANY--EVERYTHING,

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.252
DREAM ANYTHING.

00:00:53.285 --> 00:00:57.723
THERE--HE HAD TO DEVELOP
HIS OWN METHOD TO PLAY BASEBALL.

00:00:57.756 --> 00:00:59.992
HE USED TO PRACTICE AGAINST
THE WALL IN HIS BACKYARD,

00:01:00.025 --> 00:01:01.961
AND THEN HE WOULD GO CLOSER
AND CLOSER AND CLOSER

00:01:01.994 --> 00:01:02.995
AS HE GOT OLDER

00:01:03.028 --> 00:01:04.464
UNTIL HE WAS RIGHT UP
AGAINST THE WALL

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:05.765
AND CATCHING IT
LIKE THAT.

00:01:05.798 --> 00:01:07.700
IN HIS FIRST
LITTLE LEAGUE GAME EVER,

00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.735
HE PITCHED A NO-HITTER.

00:01:09.768 --> 00:01:13.406
HE PITCHED A NINE INNING GAME,
AND NO ONE GETS A HIT.

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.709
SO THEN AFTER HE HAD
THE NO-HITTER, YEARS LATER,

00:01:16.742 --> 00:01:19.445
WORD GOT OUT
TO THE HIGH SCHOOL COACHES,

00:01:19.478 --> 00:01:22.715
AND THEY WERE LIKE,
HE CAN THROW A BALL, SURE,

00:01:22.748 --> 00:01:25.485
BUT WHAT IF SOMEONE HITS
A BALL TO HIM?

00:01:25.518 --> 00:01:28.654
AND AS SOON AS HE SAID THAT,
JIM WAS LIKE,

00:01:28.687 --> 00:01:31.124
YOU WANT TO SEE THIS [bleep]?

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:33.025
PITCH!

00:01:33.058 --> 00:01:36.496
SOMEONE HIT A HARD GROUNDER
STRAIGHT AT JIM ABBOTT.

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:38.197
CATCH!

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.602
HAND OUT OF GLOVE, THROW,
OUT AT FIRST BASE,

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:45.037
ALL WITHIN, LIKE,
A HALF A SECOND.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.205
SO FAST.

00:01:46.238 --> 00:01:48.074
AND THE HIGH SCHOOL COACH
WAS LIKE,

00:01:48.107 --> 00:01:49.375
OH, NEVER MIND.

00:01:49.408 --> 00:01:51.744
YOU JUST ANSWERED MY QUESTION.
PUT HIM ON MY TEAM.

00:01:51.777 --> 00:01:54.947
I'M AN ASSHOLE.
OH, JESUS CHRIST.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.049
WINE IS THE DEVIL!

00:01:57.082 --> 00:01:58.317
[both laugh]

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.986
OKAY, WHERE ARE WE AT?

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:01.154
OH, I GOT IT.
I GOT IT.

00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:02.455
I GOT IT.

00:02:02.488 --> 00:02:04.490
THROUGHOUT
HIS HIGH SCHOOL CAREER,

00:02:04.523 --> 00:02:11.297
HE PITCHED FOUR NO-HITTERS,
INCLUDING A PERFECT GAME.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.499
SO HE GETS HIS EDUCATION,

00:02:13.532 --> 00:02:15.701
PLAYS FOR THE UNIVERSITY
OF MICHIGAN,

00:02:15.734 --> 00:02:17.603
THE WOLVERINES.

00:02:17.636 --> 00:02:18.771
WHEN HE GOT THERE,

00:02:18.804 --> 00:02:20.840
THERE WAS SO MUCH
PRESS THERE.

00:02:20.873 --> 00:02:23.409
AFTER THE TWO BAD GAMES,
PEOPLE WERE LIKE,

00:02:23.442 --> 00:02:26.913
AH, HE SUCKS.
THIS IS A PUBLICITY STUNT.

00:02:26.946 --> 00:02:28.748
THIS GUY
IS NOT A REAL PITCHER.

00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:31.817
THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO BE NICE
TO A KID WITH A HANDICAP.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.355
AND ALL OF THE PRESS LEFT.

00:02:36.388 --> 00:02:38.658
[stammering]

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:40.426
HANK, COME ON.

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.261
COME IN HERE
AND LAY DOWN.

00:02:42.294 --> 00:02:46.799
ONCE THEY LEFT,
HE STARTED PITCHING AMAZING.

00:02:46.832 --> 00:02:51.771
LAY DOWN.
LAY DOWN, FAT [bleep] BANANA.

00:02:51.804 --> 00:02:53.339
HE WAS NOT ONLY
A GOOD PITCHER,

00:02:53.372 --> 00:02:56.876
BUT HE WAS A GOOD BATTER
WHO WOULD HIT HOME RUNS.

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:59.011
THEY WIN OVER AND OVER.

00:02:59.044 --> 00:03:02.181
HE'S LIKE, I THROW THIS [bleep]
90 MILES AN HOUR.

00:03:02.214 --> 00:03:07.086
IN THE '80s,
THE YEAR 1980s,

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:08.788
NOT IN THE 80s
OF SPEEDBALL.

00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:11.090
OH, JESUS, I GOT
TO START THAT AGAIN.

00:03:11.123 --> 00:03:12.558
- NO, YOU'RE FINE.

00:03:12.591 --> 00:03:16.996
- SO I'M GONNA THROW THE BALL
IN THE 80s MILES PER HOUR

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:21.901
IN THE 1990s,
WHICH IS VERY IMPRESSIVE.

00:03:21.934 --> 00:03:23.369
- YOU SWITCHED 'EM UP.

00:03:23.402 --> 00:03:25.137
- SO I'M JIM ABBOTT.
- RIGHT.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:31.410
- I'M THROWING THE BALL
IN THE 90s IN THE 1980s.

00:03:31.443 --> 00:03:32.979
VERY IMPRESSIVE.
COME ON.

00:03:33.012 --> 00:03:35.348
- JIM ABBOTT AND COSTELLO.
- YEAH, JIM ABBOTT.

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:39.986
HE WAS PLAYING BASEBALL
LIKE HE SAID HE WOULD, AND...

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.722
[laughing]

00:03:42.755 --> 00:03:45.324
THEY WERE, LIKE, PUTTING
TOGETHER THE NATIONAL TEAM,

00:03:45.357 --> 00:03:47.260
AND THEY WERE LIKE,
I DON'T KNOW IF HE CAN DO IT,

00:03:47.293 --> 00:03:48.461
BUT IT'S GOOD P.R.

00:03:48.494 --> 00:03:49.495
LET'S DO IT.

00:03:49.528 --> 00:03:55.601
THEY PUT HIM
ON THE NATIONAL TEAM.

00:03:55.634 --> 00:03:56.769
HE GETS PUT
ON THE NATIONAL TEAM,

00:03:56.802 --> 00:03:59.338
AND THE NATIONAL TEAM
TAKE HIM DOWN

00:03:59.371 --> 00:04:00.940
TO THE PAN AMERICAN GAMES,

00:04:00.973 --> 00:04:03.175
AND THE BIGGEST SUPERPOWER

00:04:03.208 --> 00:04:07.713
IN THE PAN AMERICAN GAMES
IS CUBA,

00:04:07.746 --> 00:04:10.850
FIDEL CASTRO'S CUBA,

00:04:10.883 --> 00:04:15.454
BECAUSE FIDEL LOVES COMMUNISM

00:04:15.487 --> 00:04:17.323
AND HE LOVES BASEBALL.

00:04:17.356 --> 00:04:19.325
THOSE ARE A COUPLE THINGS
HE LOVES.

00:04:19.358 --> 00:04:21.694
THERE IS
A HUGE SEPARATION

00:04:21.727 --> 00:04:25.464
BETWEEN THE AMERICAN
AND CUBAN REGIME.

00:04:25.497 --> 00:04:29.368
JIM ABBOTT WALKS OUT
AND STARTS FOR AMERICA,

00:04:29.401 --> 00:04:33.172
AND EVERYBODY IN THE PLACE
IS LIKE, BOO!

00:04:33.205 --> 00:04:34.674
WE ARE CUBAN,

00:04:34.707 --> 00:04:36.809
THE GREATEST BASEBALL PLAYERS
IN THE WORLD.

00:04:36.842 --> 00:04:40.146
HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY THINK
YOU CAN BEAT US?

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:43.182
AMERICANS WITH TWO HANDS
CAN'T BEAT US.

00:04:43.215 --> 00:04:46.185

WAS SO REMARKABLE

OF THE GAME,

50,000 CUBANS--

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.684
THEY GAVE HIM A STANDING OVATION
WHEN HE LEFT THE FIELD.

00:05:18.717 --> 00:05:20.786
THERE WERE NO AMERICANS
IN THE STAND,

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:22.455
BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT
ALLOWED IN CUBA.

00:05:22.488 --> 00:05:26.559

CAME DOWN,

HE WOULD SAY STUFF LIKE,
EVERYONE HAS DISABILITIES.

00:05:52.918 --> 00:05:56.155
MINE ARE JUST MORE VISIBLE.

00:05:56.188 --> 00:05:59.258
