00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.200
Too much exercise can KILL YOU!

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.940
This is the best news I've heard all week!

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:15.770
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - with an interesting
new study about: the SILENT killer.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.210
Now we've been taught to believe that exercise
is great for us - because most of the time,

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.210
it is!

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.490
But it turns out there's a small portion of
the population who exercises too much - to

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.970
the point where it may actually kill them.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.339
Now chances are you've heard stories about
people who are super healthy, run 20 miles

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:35.530
every single day, and then all of a sudden
- boom, they drop dead out of nowhere.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.910
Most of the time, that's caused by cardiac
hypertrophy - which is what happens when you

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.300
exercise so much that your heart muscles get
enlarged to the point where they obstruct

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.109
your ventricles, until eventually you just
die.

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:47.899
Now most of us don't have to worry about that.

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.590
It only kills about 100 people per year in
the US, and almost all of them are insane

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.590
athletes.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.649
HOWEVER, a new study out of Germany finds
that high-intensity exercise puts us at risk

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.960
for more than just cardiac hypertrophy.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.540
The results, which were published in the journal
Heart, show that people with existing heart

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.200
disease who "overdose" on high-intensity exercise
- may actually increase their risk of death

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.850
from heart attack or stroke.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.390
Researchers looked at over 1000 people, who
had been diagnosed with stable coronary artery

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.299
heart disease for 10 years or more - and found
that those who completed daily, strenuous

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:26.430
exercise - were more than twice as likely
to die from a heart attack or stroke, than

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.040
those who exercised moderately.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.090
By contrast, people who didn't exercise at
all, were 4 times more likely to die of a

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.700
heart attack or stroke.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.090
Current guidelines say that heart disease
patients should do up to an hour of moderate

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.290
activity at least 5 times a week.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.789
Which is still in line with this study, although
their results seem to take on a sort of reverse

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:52.039
J curve - where no exercise is really really
bad, moderate exercise is ideal, and too much

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:55.719
exercise is bad - but still not as bad as
no exercise at all.

00:01:55.719 --> 00:02:00.570
It might seem counterintuitive to think that
exercise could possibly harm someone with

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.189
heart disease, but other studies have found
similar results.

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.429
Endurance training, in particular - has been
shown to send the body into an acute inflammatory

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.160
state that, over time, can damage the heart.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.129
Of course, none of this should serve a deterrent
to exercise, unless you're running marathons

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:16.260
every week.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.040
Not exercising at all, still has the worst
possible outcome - but the intensity and duration

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.410
of the exercise we do, are things we should
also be considering.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.760
What do you guys think?

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.090
Is high-intensity exercise gonna kill us all?

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.940
I can't say for sure, but I'll tell you this
much - it definitely won't kill me.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.489
