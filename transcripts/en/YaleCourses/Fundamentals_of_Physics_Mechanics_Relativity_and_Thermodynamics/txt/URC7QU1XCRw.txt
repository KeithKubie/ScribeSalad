Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Let me remind you that everything I did so far in class came from analyzing the loadings transformations and you guys should be really on top of those two marvelous equations because all the stuff we are doing as a consequence of that, I won't go over how we derive them because I've done it more than once, but I remind you that if you've got an event that occurs at XD for one person and to a person moving to the right at the last city you the same event, we'll have coordinates x prime is x minus ut over the square root and deep prime is t minus UX overseas were divided by the square. This is it. This is the key from this. By taking differences of two events, they can get similar equations for coordinate differences. In other words, they have two events are separated in space by Delta x for one person and a delta x prime for another person and likewise in time. Then you get similar formula for differences. So differences are related the same way that coordinators themselves are, or I will write it any way because I will use it sometimes one way and sometimes the other way.

Speaker 1:          00:01:34       Even this one you can think of as a formula for a difference except one of the coordinators of the origin. This is in general if you've got two events, not necessarily at the origin than the spatial separation and time separation or connected in this fashion. So I put this to work, I got a lot of consequences from that. You remember that? For example, I said take a clock that you're carrying with you are, let's take a clock that I'm carrying with me and let's see how it looks to you. And let's say it goes stick and it goes stick one more time. So for me, the time difference between the two texts will be let's say one second. It's a one second clock. The space differences zero because the clock is not going anywhere for me. So for you, Delta t prime is one second divided by the square root, which is more than one second.

Speaker 1:          00:02:33       So you will say, hey, in the time your clock, take one second, I really claimed two seconds have passed. Therefore you will say my clocks are running slow and it's easy to see from the same equations that if you replace the prime than unprimed ones simply change your domain minus you. Nothing changes the clock that you think you said breast with respect to you, we look slow to me. Then I showed you how want when you want to measure the length of a stick with this traveling past you, you get your assistance on the who are lined up on the x axis to measure the two ends of the rod at any particular time they like and take the spatial difference. That's the meaning of the length of a moving rock. You've got to measure both then at the same time. So you make sure the two measurements are done at the same time.

Speaker 1:          00:03:22       So Delta t zero, the distance between them is what I call the length of the Rod. You are moving with the rod and as long as you're moving with the Rod, uh, there are, has got two points with the separated by the length l not and one thing occurs at one and other things across to the other end. The spatial difference between them will be simply the length of the rock in your frame of reference. So Elle will be l Knox Times if you bring the squared or to the other side, l will be l not times the square root where the Delta t prime would be some Delta Tau, the rest frame divided by the square root. Okay. Not that important. Results I showed you was a lack of simultaneity. It's not absolute.

Speaker 1:          00:04:12       So I started with unfortunate example of twins born in Los Angeles in New York and you guys were pointing out that no normal woman could do that except the one from your Mama jokes and your mama jokes. You're mom is so big, she can have a kid in New York so I don't want to deal with, so that's cosmological optics right now. So I will say pick a better example. Two things happen. Something here, something there separated by distance. People cannot agree that they were simultaneous. Now you got to say very surprising. People cannot agree on length. The difference between two events. For example, New York and Los Angeles, 3000 miles apart. We think you can move in a train, you can move in a plan. You all have to agree on the separation but you don't that just a consequence of now the new relativity. In the old days before I did relativity, I was taking just the good old x and y coordinates and I said you can take a point, you can assign to it some coordinates x and y.

Speaker 1:          00:05:24       Then somebody comes along with the rotated axes and no one seems to be troubled by the fact that the same point is no given a new set of coordinates by this new person are take a pair of points on this line, but that person in the rotator system, these events have the same white prime coordinate because you see this is the white prime equals zero access, the accurate at the same white prime, but for me they're not the same white coordinate because that has that way coordinate. That's a different way quarterly, so we fully used to the fact that having the same x coordinate what we events is not an absolute statement. Depends on the frame of reference. Having the same white coordinators also not absolute, but somehow in the case of time we used to think that time differences are absolute and spatial differences are absolute and what we're learning is no, they are just like the x and the y.

Speaker 1:          00:06:25       Okay, so I'm going to do one more thing with the Lord in his transformation. Just pretty interesting. Let's take this equation for time difference. Delta t prime is Delta t minus you delta x or c square. You might invite this. So let's take two events. First, nothing happens then something else happens and Delta t is the separation in time between them. Do you do minus d one let's say t two minus Steven is positive. So the p two the second event occurred after the first event according to me. How bout according to you? Well Delta p prime doesn't have to have the same sign as Delta t because you can subtract this number. You deltek's overseas square and Delta x can be whatever you like that for. You can find that Delta t prime could be negative for you.

Speaker 1:          00:07:29       You've got to understand that's a big deal. Cause I say this happened first and that happened later and you say no, it happened the opposite way. Now this can lead to serious logical contradictions, especially if even one is the cost of even to this, the standard example both in special and general relativity that people talk about. So even one is somebody's grandmother is born and even to that person is born. We say birth of the kid. Take place long after the birth of grandmother according to me. What if in some other point of view, the kid does bond by the grandmother is not yet born?

Speaker 2:          00:08:15       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:08:16       and somebody goes in assassinates grandmother, this is in fact, this is called killing the grandmother. This words are taken right out of textbooks. Why this kind of violence is inflicted on grandmothers? I don't know, but it's a standard example. All logical contradictions involving time travel, half the comm have to do with coming back and doing something. So here's an example. It's a grandchild is born, grandmothers not yet born and something has done to prevent it from being born. Or two second after she's born, she's hit by the Mafia. How do you explain the grandchild wet or the grandchild come from? Because the cause has been eliminated. Our event, one I fired a bullet even to somebody is hit and you go to frame of reference in which the person has been hit and I haven't fired the bullet. So you come and you finish me off.

Speaker 1:          00:09:08       So nobody got this person dying. But no apparent reason because the cost has been eliminated, that simply cannot happen. I instead recognize that that is a limit to how far he can push this community. And he conceded that if it can be the cost of B, you better not find an observer for whom they are couldn't reverse order. Because see if the car's occurs after the effect, then that is some time left for somebody to prevent the cost itself from happening. And we have an effect with no perceivable costs. So we wanted to make sure the delta t prime cannot be reversed whenever the first event could be the cause of the second event. So if you go and ask this integration you've dealt, that is positive when we'll delta t prime be negative, that looks is simple Algebra. You won this drum to beat that. So that'll happen if you delta x, let me put a c here. Another see here is greater than Delta T. Okay. If that happens, things are gonna happen backwards, right? So let's modify that a little bit by putting this c over here.

Speaker 2:          00:10:26       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:10:26       And rewrite it. Finally, as you oversee is bigger than C Delta t over Delta x. That's understand what does he creation means? This equation means is that if there were two events separated in time by Delta t and in space by Delta x, I can find an observer at a certain speed you so that you divided by c if it exceeds this number four, that observer, the time order of events will be reversed.

Speaker 2:          00:11:02       Yup.

Speaker 1:          00:11:09       Hi. It's not yet clear. Velocity is greater than C. I depends on what's happening in the top and bottom, so we have to ask what does C Delta t remember don't. That is a time between two events. See, Delta t is what is the distance the light poles can travel in that time. The denominator is a spatial separation between those two events, so he went, one is here and even to is there. See Delta t is how far the light signals can travel in the time separating these two events. You've see Delta t looks like that. Then there's enough time for a light signal to go from here to here. In that case. See Delta t will be bigger than delta x, but then the velocity that you want, if your frame will be bigger than one and that's not possible in the units of wheat of light, the only time you will get a sensible value for the second frame Emily with you oversee less than one would be if see Delta t is less than delta x. That means here's the first day when he hits the second event, I light signal [inaudible] gone from there today in the time between the events,

Speaker 1:          00:12:23       so it is saying that if two events are such that that was not enough time for the light signal to leave the first event and arrive in time for the second event, then we can actually find an observer with the sensible velocity for whom the order of events is reversed. Therefore, what did we learn from this? We learned from this that you should not be. There is enough time for the light signal to go from one event to the other events. Then we will not play around with the order of events, but if there is no time, even for light signal to go system in fact allows you to see them in reverse order. But we have seen that even Twitter constantly connected that order cannot be reversed or should not be reversed. So what this is saying is it should be impossible for an event here to affect a second event, but using a signal faster than light.

Speaker 1:          00:13:24       Other words, we are going to say that if that wasn't enough time for a light signal to go from this event, that event, then this event could not have been the cause of that event. We will demand that at for what the theory for it to be, make logical senses, no signal to travel faster than the speed of light because if you've got a signal that can travel faster than the speed of light, then the first event could have been the concept, the second event because you send the signal and the signal may blow something up. But that is not enough time for light to get there in the same time. But if you allowed such things, then you will find a frame of reference with the velocity. Perfectly sensible in which they occur backwards and constant effect would have been reversed. So the answer to the whole thing in case you're still struggling with this issue is the following.

Speaker 1:          00:14:13       What the theory of relativity demands is that it should be impossible for events influence other events with signals traveling faster than light. Once you accept that, that is no logical contradiction in the theory because the only time I even said it, worst is in when there was no time for light signal to go from here to the there. That means there was no way this could have been the cost of that. For example, when I fired a bullet, uh, the cost is that my fighting of the bullet, the effect is whatever it happens to the recipient and the whole thing takes place at the speak with the speed of the bullet. In that case, a c Delta t is definitely bigger than delta x because in the time it took the bullet to go from here to there, the light bulbs could've. I've also gone there and beyond. In that case, you'll never find an observer at a speed less than that of light for whom they events will appear backwards. So the special theory of relativity, uh, isn't another way to ensure that everything is consistent is to demand that no signal travels faster than the speed of light. No energy, no signal can travel that fast. But this leads to something very interesting

Speaker 1:          00:15:25       that would be of spacetime is no modified. You see in the old days you had a space and hear this time and let's say zero. Zero is where I am right now. I am at the origin. My clock says it, I'm here right now. Any dot I pick here is in my future because tea is positive for the advantage. They have not happened yet. Any dot I draw here is an event in my past because it occurred at an earlier time. So the Newtonian view of the world, that is something called right now, this horizontal line and everything I've always called later or future. Everything below it is called pass. But in special relativity after you're taking dot Cohn relativistic thing, let's draw it here and access c Times d so whenever you have another event so that CT is bigger than x, that is enough time for the light signal to go from here to here. That's the meaning of seeing CTE is bigger the next. This is the lion CT equal sex misaligned CD bigger than x. This is the event is in the future of this event according to me and also according to anybody else.

Speaker 1:          00:16:49       In other words, Delta t is positive for me, but if you go back to those, the questions since seatbelt that is bigger than x, you'll never find anybody who said this event occurred earlier than this event.

Speaker 2:          00:17:01       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:17:01       Another way to understand it is if I want a cost, that event support that as some explosion going off there, I send a signal that goes and makes them happen. That signal has to travel slower than light to get it. That for it could have caused the event and therefore there's no screwing around with the audit of that event. That is in my future according to me and according to all observers.

Speaker 2:          00:17:25       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:17:26       If you take an event here, so this is called this whole events north of this 45 degree line is called the absolute future. By absolute, I mean future of me, not only according to me, but according to all observers, every observer, this will occur later than this. It be later by the same number of seconds, but it will be later. So the Delta t between this event and the seven is positive for me. It'll be positive for our people. They will all agree this occurred after this. Therefore, the effect appeared before the cost. I'm sorry, the costs appeared before the effect, and it is not really necessary that this event be caused by this event is only necessary that it could have been caused by this event because not every event in the university is caused by some other event. It can just simply happen. Uh, we have heard that stuff happens. Stuff happens here with no obvious costs as long as this in the future according to me, by this definition it's in the future according to all people. So this is called the future because you can affect it. For example, if I heard something terrible's going to happen at this point I can send my guys to go over there and do something. They have to travel at the speed that it is less than the speed of light so they can affect, these events are called the absolute past. What that means is any event here could have been the cost of what's happening to me right now because from that event a signal can be sent to arrive where I am right now at a speed less than the speed of light.

Speaker 2:          00:19:08       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:19:08       This line, which is called the light cone is a borderline case where you can communicate from here to here using the light signal. So that's also considered as future. But what about an event here? Suppose this distance is two seconds times the velocity of light. That does not happen yet.

Speaker 1:          00:19:37       I suppose. I go there and opened my envelope and it says something terrible is going to happen at this point. That is nothing I can do. There's nothing I can do in the Newtonian days. There is something you can do. Tell someone else to really hurry up and get there and do something well not be, you cannot do that because for that, someone to leave you with the instruction to do something about this requires that person to travel faster than light and that's not allowed. So even though you know things can happen here in the future and you have knowledge of the fact that someone's planning to do something there, you cannot get there.

Speaker 1:          00:20:18       Okay? That's a really important thing. Uh, even for people who are going to law school and all of you guys are not going to physics, but suppose you're going to law school, you got the DNA defense, right? My clients DNA doesn't match. He has another defense. If your client was accused of doing something here and was last seen here, you can argue that my client was outside the light cone that's called outside the light cone defense. And it's absolutely water tight better than anything. Cause if that event is outside the late corner of your client, the client cannot be held responsible because your client will have to send a signal passionate, enlightened that lies on broken. So what about the status of an event like this? The status of this event is I can actually find other observers moving at speed less than light for whom this event occurs before this event.

Speaker 2:          00:21:18       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:21:18       it's the order of events can be reversed, but it will not lead to logical contradictions because we know the two events are not constantly connected. So space and time, it used to be divided into upper half plane and lower half plane into the future and past and a tiniest sliver call present now divided into three regions. The absolute future that you can affect the absolute past worth, whose whose events can affect you. And this is not, doesn't have a name.

Speaker 2:          00:21:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:47       If you want, you can call it the little it, the future according to you, but I'll find somebody to whom that occurs before this one.

Speaker 2:          00:21:54       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:21:55       Okay. That's also a consequence of the Lord in Samsung Nation. So you can see that the equation, so very deceptively simple in fact that a lot easier looking than some equations with angular momentum. Right? But the consequences are really stupendous. They all follow from that equation. And of course, if you invent a theory like this, you got to make sure that are no contradictions, right? Suppose you find the theory. Yeah, very happy with everything the last day of lights coming out. Right? And somebody points out to you that the order of events can be reversed. Then you got agree, you'll be in a panic. Because how can I reverse the order of events then? The theory is so beautiful. Internally it says you can reverse the order of events if they could not have been causally connected where the causally connected means a signal traveling at a speed less than light, good dot have gone from the first of the second event.

Speaker 2:          00:22:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:46       And the theory, uh, does not allow them to be, if a signal could have gone, it allows them to be never reversed. If signal could not have gone. It does say you can find people for whom even psycho in the reverse order. All right, so this is the uh, second thing and it's called the light corn for the following reason, I only shown you an x coordinate, but if you have white coordinate coming onto the blackboard, the surface of look like a corn, that's why we call it the late corn. So sitting at a point in four dimensional space time, there's a cone and all points in that forward light cone or even you can effect all points in the backward light corner events that can come and get you right now and the rest of the thing outside the two cones a you cannot do anything about, even though you know something's going to happen and they cannot do anything to you, you open an envelope and it says somebody he had is planning to do something to you.

Speaker 1:          00:23:40       You don't have to worry because that person cannot get you in the time available. The fastest signal is the light signal and that won't get there and neither will anything else. All right. Now we are going to do something which is theoretically or mathematically very pretty so for those of you who like a mathematical elegance, this is certainly the best example I can offer you because it is simple and also rather profound but it's completely by analogy. The analogy is the following. We have seen that when we rotate our axes as have shown there that the x prime is not the same as x related by this formula and wipe crime. It's also not the same as why but related by this formula.

Speaker 2:          00:24:37       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:24:38       nothing is sacred coordinates of a point or not sacred. They are just dependent on who is looking at them from what orientation but even in this world we noticed that x Prime Square plus y prime square is the same as x squared plus y squared. They only the length of the point connecting the origin to you or the distance from the artisans and effected by rotations. This is called an invariant. This doesn't depend on who is looking at it. Everyone will agree on this, but they won't agree on x and they want to agree on white. But they will agree on this.

Speaker 1:          00:25:18       So it's reasonable to ask. In the relativistic case where people cannot agree on time, coordinate artspace coordinate maybe the square of the time and the square of the space will be the same for two people. One can ask that question. So we'll we look at that. We'll find out that that's not the case. The squared plus x squared is not in variant, but even before you do that, you should shut at the prospect of writing something like this, right? What's wrong with this? Good. Everyone's on top of the unit scam. So we cannot add t squared x squared. There is no way this can be anything. So we don't have, we have to fix that. We got to have either both coordinates in spacetime measured with lengths or with time. The standard trick is to do the following. Let's introduce uh, an object with two components. I'm going to call it capital x. The first component of that is going to be called x. One is going to be called EC zero. Second is going to be called x one x zero I mean x one is just our family or x. X zero is going to be essentially a time but multiplied by C. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:26:35       Why do I switch from t and x two zero and one it is just that if you want to go back to more coordinates, if you wanted to bring back y and z then I just managed them for future use that in four dimensions you really have zero x one x two and x three that is a shorthand for zero and what you and I used to call the position are of the project you've just said in one dimension, the vector art becomes a number x and I want to call the number as x one because it's the first of the three coordinates and if you're doing super strings, you're going to have 10 coordinates and one will be x, not in the nine will be spatial quarters. So we like the new medical index rather than letters in the alphabet because you run out of letters but you don't run out of these subscripts.

Speaker 1:          00:27:29       So I'm writing it purposely in many ways because if you ever go read something or you're involved in a lab project or the group is studying something you want to read, the paper people would refer to the coordinates in spacetime in many ways. Some, we'll call it a, some people like to write the x the following way. X One x two x three x four and x for is Ct. That's what you call that, the fourth dimension. But it's still the fourth dimension. But you can either put it at the end of the first family at three or at the beginning. So it's very common for people to use either notation. I'm just going to call it zero. So zero is just time, okay? Multiplied by C so that it has units of length and multiplying by c doesn't do anything. Everybody agrees on what? See. So we will all multiply our time. Coordinate Spicy. All right, so let's ask the following question. What does the Lord and his transformation look like when a writer in terms of these numbers? So first take x prime is x minus ut divided by the famous square root, but tea is not what I want. Cts, what I want. So I fudge it as follows. I rated the x minus you oversee time CT divided by one minus use square overseas square.

Speaker 2:          00:28:55       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:28:55       this I'm going to write as x is now called [inaudible] and I'm going to introduce a new symbol Beta here. This guy is called zero divided by one minus Beta square, but Beta is universal convention for you oversee if all velocities that measured as a fraction of the velocity of light than Beta is a number between zero and one. So the final way I want to write the Lord and his transformation for coordinate is that x one prime is x one minus Beta times x zero. You might advice squad room, so you have to get used to this beta. I mean you're falling nicely what I was saying in terms of you, but you have to get used to this beta. We won't use it a whole lot, but I put it here so you can recognize it. When people refer to it in the literature. If you go read something, what's the transformation law for time? Remember t prime was t minus UX oversee square divided by route one minus Beta Square Betas squared is clearly what sitting downstairs you oversee is Beta. So what do you think we should do? We should multiply both sides by sea because if you multiply both sides by see policy their policy there and get rid of this one, then you find x not crime is x not minus Beta times x one over square root of one minus Beta Square. So let me write that here. Don't you see the relationship with the coordinates is nice and symmetric.

Speaker 2:          00:30:46       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:30:48       if you're right in terms of excellent ante, the coordinate transformation lies not quite symmetric and that's because one has units of length in one as UNICEF time. But if you rescale your time to try and do a lane, then the transformational laws are very simple than symmetric between the two coordinates in space that are also the other coordinates. The y direction. Extra prime is x two and the z direction x to be primus. Next three. In other words, the lengths perpendicular to the motion or something you can always agree on one can talk and talk about why that is true. Basically what we're saying is if you're zooming along and you drew a line that says y equal to one and odors and Leb agreed on it, we will have to agree on it. Even when I start moving relative to you because you've got your own line and there's no in your should about my life should be about your line or below your life. The lanes originally agreed. There is no reason why a Milan, Ben Saba viewers at your lines below mine because by symmetry there is no reason why one should be higher than the other and the reason this requires that the two lines, which last forever can be compared to anywhere you like. I like rods which are running away from each other and cannot be compared the lion here, which is why equals the three has got to be white validity for both of us. So the transfers coordinates but not modified.

Speaker 1:          00:32:18       Okay. So that's why I don't talk about them too much. All the interesting action, this between any one quart in it along with motion is taking place and time. So now let's ask ourselves maybe uh, x, not prime square minus plus x one prime square is the same as this squared plus that way. Well, let me just tell you that, uh, I'm not going to try something that I know will not work. In other words, you might think x not prime squared plus x one prime squared is equal to x squared plus x one squared. Well that just doesn't work.

Speaker 2:          00:32:54       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:32:54       that doesn't work because one over the square root is not a cost data. And Beta with the square root is not assigned data. You cannot make them cost and sign of something. If you could, that would work, but it doesn't work. But I'll tell you what does work. Let's take x, not prime square minus x one prime square the square of the time. Coordinate minus squared of the space. Coordin with the minus. So let's try to do this in our head. Was waiting this and subtracting it from the square of this one downstairs. I think we all agree you get one minus Beta square because the square root, the square. How about upstairs? First you got to square this guy, this guy, we'll give you x, not square. Let's bait and squared x squared minus two Beta x, not x one from that actual subtract the square of x one Prime Square. That'll give me minus x one square minus Beta squared. X not squared plus twice Beta x, not x one. It's just simple Algebra and these cross Jerome's canceled and you notice I got an x squared times one minus Beta squared minus x one squared times one minus Beta square, right? This Algebra I trust you guys can do at home and the result is this going to be x, not squared minus x one square.

Speaker 1:          00:34:35       That's very nice. It says that even though people cannot agree on the time or space coordinator of an event, just like saying people cannot agree on what is x and waters, why they can agree on this quadratic function, you form more to the coordinates, but it's very different from ordinary rotations where you take the sum of the squares here, you got to take the difference of the squares and that just the way it is. Even though time is like another coordinator that mixes with space, it's not quite the same. In other words, if I brought back the all the transfers coordinates, then you will find x not frame square minus x one prime squared minus x two prime square minus x three prime squared, x squared minus x squared minus x squared minus six three square. This you can do because x one prime individually is equal to x one, so you can put them on both sides. This is the actual four dimensional results for people who really want to leave the x axis and move freely in space, which you're allowed to. This is the invariant. This is the object that everyone agrees on. Uh, I me once again, but dropped this most of the time. I'm not going to worry about transfers coordinator.

Speaker 2:          00:35:55       So

Speaker 1:          00:35:57       this is the analog of the leg square for vector and it's called the space time in trouble.

Speaker 2:          00:36:01       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:36:04       It's not the space in trouble. It's not the time in trouble. It's a space time interval between the origin and the point x. T.

Speaker 2:          00:36:13       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:36:14       and this is denoted by the symbol national universal formula, but let's use square space time separation. Notice that even though it's called square square, need not be always positive. Definite you can take to events, but with the time coordinate is the same at the time. Coordinate the zero. The space coordinator is not zero, then s squared will be negative. Whereas the usual Pythagoras Lang square x squared plus y squared is positive. Definite, always positive. The space time interval can be positive or negative or zero. It's positive. If x not can beat the sum of the squares of those guys, there's negative. If they can beat x, not Anders equal to zero if x squared equals [inaudible] squared.

Speaker 2:          00:37:07       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:37:08       so if you want, if you go back to this diagram I drew here, this is x one plus x not equal the Ct.

Speaker 2:          00:37:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:22       These are events for with Esquire is positive, these and events but with squared is positive. Be said even for with Esquire is negative. These are events in with a squared is zero Savannah but s squared is positive. We have a name for that. It's called a time like separation. This is called time like separation because the time part of the separation squared is able to beat the space part of the separation. He's got more time component then space component. No, you can also do the following. Let me introduce some rotation. Now let us agree that we will use capital x. What is space time which watch calling for vectors afforded vectors. Scott, four components and the components are x not and since I'm tired of writing x one x two x three I will call it art

Speaker 1:          00:38:26       two in the specialty of relativity, what you do is you take the three components of space and add one more of time and form a vector, the four components. And we will agree that the Nazi symbol for a space time vector is a capital x. No, I've been catalysts in my writing. Sometimes they use small x and big expert. You guys should be little more careful. Big x like this, but no subscript will stand for this. Four numbers is afford vector. It's affordable, creates a vector living in space time and when you go to another frame of reference, the components, the photo vector will mix with each other.

Speaker 1:          00:39:04       Then we are going to define A. Dot. Product is going to be funny. Dot. Product is going to be called X. Dot. X usual dot. Product was some of the squares of the components, but this funny dot product will be equal to x large square minus the length of the special parts square. Pardon me? This is a big x. These are all small. Big X is the name for the vector of the four components. It's the position back to it in space time. Uh, these are, this is the same as writing x squared minus x one square minus x squared minus x three square. Suppose there are two events. One occurs at the spacetime coordinate x. A second event occurs at a new point I, let me call it x Bar, whose time coordinator as zero bar was positioned. Coordinate this unfortunate that vector ours with a bar on it.

Speaker 2:          00:40:12       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:40:13       These are like two vectors in the x y plane. You and I, if you're going to literally each other will not agree on the components of this are the components of that, but we will agree on X. Dot. X Prime. In other words, x dot. X will be the same as x prime dot. Expired praying.

Speaker 1:          00:40:35       What I'm saying is if you go to moving frame of reference, the components of the vector x goes into X. Prime was at x zero prime and some art frame and likewise the comp, the backlit x bar as new components export, praying which at x zero bar praying and our bar, right look, it's a story is the same like in two dimensions. Components. The vectors are arbitrary. It Bailey with the frame of reference, but the dot product of vectors is the same no matter how you rotate your axes. Because dark product is length of eighth and length, the Times cosine of the angle between them and none of the three things changes when you rotate your access. Well, this is the analog of the dot product in spacetime because this is the guy that, same for everybody. You can say, why don't you study this combination?

Speaker 1:          00:41:33       It's so nice. She was all pluses. I like that. I don't study that because that combination is not special. If I have one value for the combination, you will have a different value for the combination. It does nothing privileged. It's the one with a minus signs in it that has a privileged role of playing the role of the dark product. So space time is not Euclidean Euclidean space. The space in which we live and distance squared is the sum of the squares of all the coordinates. It's a pseudo euclidean space in which to find the invariant link, you've got a square, some components, and subtract from them the square of some other components.

Speaker 1:          00:42:14       Okay. So finally, if you would take a difference vector now, other were take the difference of two events, then this patient coordinator according to me, the difference in space coordinate, namely c times Delta t swear minus delta x, where would it be? Seed time to Delta p Prime Square Wayne has built, takes brains with odd. If you like x, not square minus x one square will be x, not prime squared minus x one crimes where I'm using the rotations back and forth. So you get used to writing the space name coordinates in two different ways. So it not only works for coordinates but for coordinate differences. You understand two events occur, one here now in one there later. Let's say they're separated in time by two meters that separated in, I'm sorry, in space by two meters and time by 11 seconds. Uh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to write this. I meant to write delta x squared minus Delta x one squared equal to delta x, not frame square minus delta x one prime suite. So do you guys follow the meaning of the statement some? Most things are relative distance between events, relative time interval between eventuality, but this combination somehow is in billion. Everybody agrees on what it is. Okay. Now we are going to understand the space. I'm in trouble.

Speaker 2:          00:44:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:44:17       Delta squared as a name for a small artist based and miserable formed or the differences. Now we are going to apply this to the following problem. I'm going to give you a feeling for what space I'm in trouble when applied to the study of a single particle. So previously delta x and Delta t but separation between two random unrelated events are arbitrary events. But now I want you to consider the following event you had as a particle in space time and it moves there. This is better. This the beginning. That's the way I did this at the end. So now I want delta x to be distance.

Speaker 2:          00:45:02       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:45:03       Logical travels and I want Delta t to be the time in which it did this.

Speaker 2:          00:45:19       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:45:20       so these are two events in the life of a particle to events laying on the trajectory of a product in the [inaudible] plain. You draw a line is a trajectory because at every time that it's an accident that described particle motion and this is the delta x and this is the Delta t. Let's look at the space time interval between the two events. Delta s square will be c Delta t squared minus delta x squared, but we are going to rewrite this as follows,

Speaker 2:          00:45:58       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:46:01       equals Mc Delta t squared times one minus v Square Overseas Square. That v is delta x over Delta t because these are the two he mentioned the life of a party, the distance over time, it's actually the velocity of the product. I would always use v for the velocity of a particle that I'm looking at and you for the velocity difference between my frame of reference and your frame of reference. So you is always the speed between frames and v is the speed of some particular I'm looking at. So let's take the square root of both sides and be fine. Delta s equal to c Delta t times square root of one minus B squared overseas square.

Speaker 2:          00:46:55       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:46:56       So the space time interval between two events in the life of particle, you see times the time difference times this factor, oh this is supposed to be an invariant. By that I mean no matter who calculates the space, I'm in trouble. The person's going to get the same answer. So let's calculate the space. I'm in trouble as computed by the particle itself. What does the political thing happened? Well, particle says, uh, in other words you're with the particle. So in your frame of reference for the particle now.

Speaker 2:          00:47:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:38       The time difference between the two events, let me call it some Delta Tau and the space difference. What's the space difference between the two events? Yup. Yeah, zero because as far as the particles concerned, I'm still here. So if I'm moving from my vantage, my x coordinates, wherever they chose to put it in the beginning and that's where it'll follow. So the two events particle cited here in particle cited there have different x coordinates for a person to whom the particles moving. But if your co moving with the particle then you are like, you are x coordinate as seen by you. Does not change. Therefore delta x is zero. Therefore the space time interval will be simply see times Delta Tau, but Tau is the time measured by a clock going with the party.

Speaker 1:          00:48:33       So Delta Tau is the time in particles frame other words. If the particle had its own clock, that's the time it will say has elapsed between the two points than its trajectory. So it's not so hard to understand. So I am the product line moving. I'm looking at my watch and I'm saying with time will pass for me, right? One second, two seconds. That's the time according to me. If you guys see me, you will disagree with me on how far a mood and how much time it took. That's your delta x and your Delta t. But for me there's only Delta Tau. There is no delta x for me. So the space time interval when you described particle behavior is essentially the time elapsed according to the party. So it's not hard to understand why everybody agrees on that. See you and I don't have to agree on how much time elapsed between when the particle was here and when it was there. But if we ask how much time elapsed according to the particle, we're all asking the same question. That's where we all get the same answer. So the spacetime interval is called the proper time. Proper time is another name.

Speaker 1:          00:49:49       Well at the time as measured by a clock caddied with the party. So let's write it this way. The space time interval is really see times Delta Tau and Delta Tau is also an invariant. Namely everyone agrees on Delta Tau. And what's the relation between Delta t and Delta Tau? Delta t is the time according to any old person. And Delta Tau is the time according to the clock. Then you saw that, uh, the space time interval. See Delta Tau.

Speaker 2:          00:50:25       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       what's equal to so delta t famous squared or the one minus B squared, c squared. So I'm, we are going to, I'm starting to see cancels on both sides. This, the relations. So I will be using the fact that ditto over Dt is equal. The square root of one minus B squared. C squared, r d t over detail is one over square root of one minus B squared equals c squared.

Speaker 1:          00:51:06       In other words, the time elapse between two events in the life of a particle as seen by an observer for whom it has a velocity compared to as seen by a clock moving with the particle. That ratio is given by this as the particle speeds up. Let's see if it makes sense. As we approached to see this number of brought to zero, that means you can say it took aquatic has been traveling for 30 hours, but with this number almost vanishing, the particle books have been traveling for a very short time. That's the way it is. The particular always think it took less time to go from here to there compared to any other observer because the clock runs fastest in his own restaurant. Okay, no, this is the new video, but I'm going to use to develop the next step. The next step is the following. You Newtonian mechanics particles had a position x and maybe y and Z, but let me just say x. Let me take one more. If that accident it had y and these were varying with time, then I formed a vector r because I f times x times y

Speaker 1:          00:52:21       and the vector is mathematically defined as an entity with two components so that when you rotate the axes, the component's going to experiment with frame which are related to x and y. But the cost leaders and scientists that defined to be a vector. Oh, if I went to you and said, okay, that's one vector, the position vector, can you point to me another vector? Anybody? No other vectors in Newtonian mechanics. Yes sir. You don't have any other vectors in the good old mechanics days. So the only vector you've seen his position,

Speaker 2:          00:52:59       we lost the

Speaker 1:          00:53:00       very good, yeah, that's right. So you're right to do that. You got to use certainly know the answers so you shouldn't hesitate. So how do you get to velocity from position?

Speaker 1:          00:53:10       You take the data with this, you've got to ask yourself, why does the act of taking [inaudible] off a vector of produce and other vector and what's the date of it to you changed the guy by some Delta and you divide by the time. Well changing the is obviously vector because difference of two vectors, a vector dividing by time. It's like multiplying by the reciprocal of the time. It's like multiplying by number and I've told you multiplying a vector by a number also gives you a vector maybe longer or shorter. Therefore, Delta r is a vector because it's the difference of our later minus are now dividing by Delta. T is the same as multiplying by 10,000 or a hundred thousand or a million. It doesn't matter. That's also a vector and the limit is also a vector that fourth. Then you take an end of it [inaudible] you get it back.

Speaker 2:          00:53:58       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:54:01       and then you can, once you got this date of it tube, it becomes addictive. You can take second delivery to sentence. You said you can have acceleration. Then you can get, you can take the acceleration multiplier mass by a mass. No, that is called a scaler. The massive particle is a number that everyone will agree on. It does no bad action. Yeah, so the product of a number and the vector is another vector and that vector of course is the force. So Detroit is a vectors and multiples of vectors by scalers, namely things that don't change when you rotate your axes are ways to generate vectors. So what I wanted to do is I want to generate more vectors because they only four vector I have is the position for vector with this. This guy, capital x was competence. I write for you again our x not witness coordinator for CT and x one which is coordinating for x and you can put the other components if you like.

Speaker 2:          00:55:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:55:05       Now take this x to be the coordinate in space time of an object that's moving and I want to take the date of it to have that to get myself something. I could call the velocity vector in relativity but the of cannot be. The time did have it.

Speaker 1:          00:55:25       You guys have to understand that if I take these things of course, uh, in spacetime, the particles moving, I can certainly tell you where it is at one time in bed. It is a little later and I can take time to it too, but the time that have active of a vector in four dimensions is not a vector because time is like any other component. Now it's like taking the white date of it, the Webex, that doesn't give you a vector. You've got to take a debt of it to the Spec to somebody that does not transform. That is not changed from one observer to the other. So you have any idea where I'm going with this?

Speaker 2:          00:56:01       Yes. Pardon me? Do you like the space?

Speaker 1:          00:56:08       Yes. Are you can take data to with respect to the time as measured by the clock with the moving with the polycom. So you can take the Tau Delta with two, in other words, let the particle move some more Moen, Delta x, namely Delta x, Delta x one x two, etc. That difference will also plans from like a vector. We have seen many, many times differences in support in a transform like electric divided by this guy,

Speaker 2:          00:56:36       oh,

Speaker 1:          00:56:39       which is the time according to a clock moving with the party. Everybody agrees on that because we're not asking how much time elapsed according to you are according to me. We are going to quarrel about that indefinitely. We are asking how much time passed according the particle itself. Then no matter who computers at a time, you will get the same answer and that's what he wanted divided by.

Speaker 2:          00:57:01       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:57:02       so I'm going to form a new quantity called velocity, which is the dead of it to off. This is to toe. Then I'm going to use the chain rule and write it as Dex, Dt Times Dt. Ditto. That becomes Stan one over one minus V squared overseas, Square Times d x, not the t, the x one d t d x Two d, t, et cetera.

Speaker 2:          00:57:40       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:57:43       so you find the rate of change as measured by a clock moving with the particle and that has the virtue that watch you get out of this process. We'll also be afforded vector. By that, I mean it's four components will transform any go to moving frame. Just like the four components of X. Yeah. You remember when you took x and y and they rotated the axes experiments excos scientists, why sign and so on. If you take time. Bit of it is we would find the [inaudible] or the velocity in the rotated frame will be the later the x and y in the old frame by the same core science in the same signs. Because the act of taking derivatives, that doesn't change the way the object transforms. So this is my new four vector. In fact, let me put the third guy to a dx three over DT.

Speaker 2:          00:58:31       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:58:32       So what I did was I took the towel data to for which we don't have good intuition and ordered in terms of a tea date of it too, which we have a good intuition because no matter how much I understand tells you about space and time, we think of time as different from space. So we think in terms of time derivatives, but to form a four dimensional vector. It's not enough to do that is what I'm saying. Everybody turned that is divided by this because that's the way of Rewriting d by d towers. DVDT times this factor.

Speaker 2:          00:59:00       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:59:01       so now I am ready to define what I'm going to call momentum in relativity. It's going to be called the Ford momentum. Everything is the for something. The four vector port position. This is called the four velocity.

Speaker 2:          00:59:16       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:59:19       No, I'm going to define something called the forward. The forward momentum is going to be the mass of a particle when it's sitting at rest multiplied by this velocity. So what does it going to be? Let me write it out. What does the x not over Dt. You guys remember x Nordic. We'll set, sorry,

Speaker 1:          00:59:53       x not with CT and x. Not over. DT will be equal to c. You're right, if that's what you were saying. I agree with you. Yes. So this is a vector, m zero c all in one minus v squared over c squared. Then the other guy, other components, let me write simply as m zero times the family at velocity times one minus B squared over c square. If you want it to keep the x, Y and z velocities, you can keep them as a vector or if he just wanted to live in two dimensions, one space in one time, drop the arrow. So we have manufactured now a new beast. It's got four components. What is it? I modeled it after the old momentum. I took the mass and multiply it by what it's going to pass forward velocity in my new world and I got this creature with four parts. You've got to understand what the four parts mean. It's got a part that looks like an ordinary vector.

Speaker 2:          01:00:58       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:00:58       and it's got a part that is no vectors in it. Completely in analogy with the fact that x had a park that looked like a vector aimed at three spacial components and apart that in the old days was called a scaler because it didn't transport. But of course in the new world everything got mixed up. We got to know who this is and we have to know who this is. So I want to show you what they are. So he had is my new for vector m zero c over one minus B squared or c square and m zero let me drop the other components except yesterday. Aesthetics. Let me not worry about that now.

Speaker 2:          01:01:44       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:01:45       I I wrote that because I want to be able to call it the force vector. It's crazy to call this afforded vector, I should call it a two vector. Do you guys have to say about it is seen two vectors. We have seen two vectors. Next white plain, this is a two back that in space time audits, part of this big four component object with the Ford of actor in four dimensional space time.

Speaker 1:          01:02:06       So we have created something and we are trying to understand what we have created. So I, let me look at this guy first. This guy looks like m Zero v divided by this factor. I don't know what it stands for, but I say, well relativistic physics should reduce the Newtonian physics. When I look at slowly moving optics, because we know Newton was perfectly right when he studied slowly moving optics. If I go to a slowly moving up there, so we oversee becomes negligible, I dropped that and that becomes MV. I know that the whole momentum, so this guy is just the all momentum properly corrected for relativistic theory. So this quantity here deserves to be called momentum. Little P, you can put an Arrow on it if you want to keep the three components that don't put an arrow.

Speaker 2:          01:02:59       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:03:03       so that's off that four vector. The three components are just momentum, but not defined that the old way. It's not am not be [inaudible] m not divided by this. So the moment that the particle is very interesting in relativity, even though nothing can go faster than light, that doesn't mean the momentum has an upper limit m zero times. See, because the momentum is not mass times velocity mass divided by this crazy factor. So as you approach the speed of light, as we approached to see the denominator is very close to zero, this number can become as big as you like. So we had people building bigger and bigger accelerators. If you ask them how fast is your particle moving? But everybody in Fermi lab in cern, it's all close to the velocity of light is 99.9999 other person, a few more nines. Nothing is impressive and you look at velocity, but when you look at the momentum, it makes a big difference how much of the one you have subtracted in the bottom.

Speaker 1:          01:04:00       If you only got a different than 19 decimal place where you got a huge moment. So particles have limited velocity in relativity but unlimited momentum. It also means the speed up this particle is going to take more and more force as it picks up speed. In other words, you'll be pushing it like crazy. It won't pick up speed, but there's momentum will be going up. You'll pick up speed, but let's pick up in speed will be imperceptible because in the 19th decimal place of the oversea, it will go from nine nine nine nine nine nine nine for something near the end that the last day. That will change. But the woman will change a lot. But I don't want to stop before looking at this guy so we don't know who this is. So we take this thing. This is the zero component of p just like I called it x, not in the old days, I'm going to call it peanut. Peanut was m zero c divided by one minus B squared overseas. So I don't know what to make of this guy either. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:05:02       t equal to zero. I get m zero see that looked like the mass of a particle but I have no idea. Okay, so it's the mass of particles. See here. Then I put B equals zero in the bottom because the top had a v and not the something was leftover that looked like something familiar. Namely momentum here. If I take the equal to zero too quickly, what's leftover is nothing reminiscent of anything in Newtonian mechanics. So you want to go in what's called the next audit and we oversee, you don't want to totally ignore it. You want to keep the first non zero term. So we write it as m zero c times one minus via screwed overseas square to the power. Minus one half.

Speaker 1:          01:05:47       I've just written it with the thing upstairs for the minus one half is the exponent. Then I didn't mind you. The good old Formula One plus extra. The end is one plus annex, plus dot, dot, dot. If x is very small, so if you use that, you get m zero c times one plus B squared or what? Boosie square plus higher powers of B squared overseas square. So what are these terms coming out? Well, there's the first time for a bit. I have absolutely no intuition. The second term, it looks like one half MV squared divided by c. So the for the first time I see something familiar. I see the good old Kennedy energy, but not quite because have this number see here. So I decided maybe I shouldn't look at peanut, but I should look like look at c times p not maybe that looks something more familiar that looked like an Nazi square plus one half Mv Square. That's more than what trends depending on higher ed and higher ed powers to be squid overseas.

Speaker 2:          01:07:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:07:02       But now we know who this guy is. This is what we used to call the kinetic energy of a particle. By virtue of his motion. As the particle picks up speed, the Kennedy going to d itself receives more corrections because the other terms with more and more powers. So we oversee or not negligible, you got to put them back in basically up to compute this object. Exactly. But a low velocity is, this is the main term. So this is what led Einstein and mainly him to realize that this quantity is talking about the energy of an object.

Speaker 2:          01:07:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:07:37       This is certainly energy recognize I can put it to good use, right? You run windmills and so on. With kinetic energy are a hydro electric power is from churning kinetic energy or water into work. So you figure this is also part of the energy. So the first conclusion of my insane was even a particle that is not moving seems to have an energy and that's called the rest energy. If the particle is moving, then go back to the derivation and you can find, see at times peanut is m Nazi squared over this thing. This is the full expression for the energy of a moving party, not the approximate one. If you keep the whole thing, this is what you get.

Speaker 1:          01:08:19       So this has been a particle moves. It's got an energy that looks like some velocity dependent defendant, mass times c square. And when the party glisses rested, it's got that energy. And that's the origin of the big formula, relating energy and mass. So it leaves open the possibility that even a particular at you think Vienna particulates at rest you have squeezed everything. You couldn't get out of the party. Like what more can I do for you? You give it all it's garden and stock. But I caught him Einstein, that is a lot of fun left. You can do something more if there's a way to destroy this. So in his theater, he doesn't tell you how you should do that, but it did point out that if you can get rid of the mass because it was energy, some other form of energy mistake its place by the law of conservation of energy.

Speaker 1:          01:09:05       So that's how we all the nuclear reactions work and nuclear reactions. Uh, you can take two parts, like two hydrogen atoms, hydrogen nuclei. You can fuse them into helium and you will find the helium's mass is less than the mass of the two parts. So that is some energy missing, some mass missing. That means some energies missing. That's the energy released in fusion. Or you can take uranium nucleus and give it a tap and break it up into Barium and Krypton and some nutrients and you will find the fragments together and have a mass less than the parent. And the missing mass times c squared is the energy of the reaction that comes out in the kinetic energy of the fast moving particles. So Einstein, this wrongly called the father of the bomb because this is as far as you went, didn't specify how they extract energy from mass, but showed very clearly that rest energy that a particular address seems to have a term that should be called energy because this guy certainly is.

Speaker 1:          01:10:00       Yes. Uh, we'll be three over eight m zero B, the for over c to the fourth. Uh, I don't carry more terms in my head, but I can crank them out needle, they are more corrections to kinetic energy. In other words, why is this an important concept? If two particles collide, we believe energy is conserved. So you want to add the energy before and competitive energy after. If you want them to perfectly match. If you stopped here, your bookkeeping will not work before will not equal after. You've got to keep all this infinite number of terms to get it exactly right. But if you're satisfied to one part in a million or something, maybe that's as many terms as are needed. And at very low velocities, you don't even need that because this is never changing in a coalition. Every particle as restaurants, this is what we balanced when we collided.

Speaker 1:          01:10:52       Remember we call it a blocks and we balanced the kinetic energy. Actually that energy is there in every block, but it's not changing. It's canceling out in the before and after. So unless the two blogs annihilated and disappeared, then you really have something interesting. But you don't have that in, uh, the Newtonian physics. Okay. So I should tell you that I've given you guys a two more problems. One of which is optional. You don't have to do that, but it's a very interesting problem and I want you to think about it because it's a problem whether there's a two rockets headed towards each other, both have the same lengths. They one meter and this guy thinks he is at rest. The second rocket is zooming past him like this. When the tail of this rocket pass to the tip of this, he sends out a little torpedo aimed at this one.

Speaker 1:          01:11:41       Clearly it doesn't do any harm, but looking at it from the point of view of this person, this person says, well I am a big rocket. I'm moving like this. And then when my tail met the tip of this rocket ice, he sent out an explosive, which are certainly hit me down here. So the question is, does this upper rocket get attack? Does it get hit by the lower one or not? From one point of view, you miss the other point of view when you expand this one in shrink. This one. You definitely got to it. So you've got to ask. I mean, do you get hit or don't get it? You cannot have two answers to one question. So I've given the problem, we've given you a lot of hymns, and I think even though it's optional, if you do that problem, you've got nothing to fear. Okay? We'll give you a good practice and how to think clearly about any number of these problems. And I've given you enough hints on how to do that.
