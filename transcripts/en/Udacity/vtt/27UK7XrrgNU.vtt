00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.630
So by now hopefully you've bought into this idea. That it

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.350
makes sense to start a product by thinking at a high

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.192
level and not delving into details too soon. Now you're going

00:00:09.192 --> 00:00:12.826
to apply that idea to something you've actually built before. And

00:00:12.826 --> 00:00:17.380
the way to do that, is first you'll identify a product.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.020
This doesn't necessarily have to be a mobile app, or even

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.450
an app at all. It should just be some product that

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.470
you've worked on in the past. Once you decide on that,

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.940
you'll think about what the intended UX was. And

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.200
I'm using this word intended, even though there's definitely

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.670
a chance you may not have explicitly thought about

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.680
user experience. You probably had some implicit understanding of

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.440
what you wanted this app, or this product to

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.530
feel like using. Next you'll make a Prezi Wireframe,

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.220
to help you focus on the high level flow

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.740
of this product. And then you'll find opportunities for high

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.990
level improvements. This can be rearranging this steps, adding a step,

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.790
or moving a step. Or hopefully by forcing yourself to write

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.650
down the flow of the product at high level, kind of like

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.600
this. You'll spot any opportunities for big picture improvements, good luck.
