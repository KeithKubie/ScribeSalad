00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.190
Now it's your turn.

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:03.790
Let's do a quiz on write-back caches.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.990
Suppose we have a direct map cache and
this is one entering that cache.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.960
And all of the axises we will
do will map to that one entry.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.932
The valid bit starts out at 0.

00:00:13.932 --> 00:00:15.859
The dirty bit starts out at 1.

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:18.914
And the tag starts out at A.

00:00:18.914 --> 00:00:23.330
The processor does the following
sequence of axises.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.280
It reads A, reads B, writes B,
reads C, reads D, writes D.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:35.320
And all of these, A, B, C, and D,
map to the same place in the cache.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.070
The question for

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.960
you, is, after these accesses,
what is the new state of the cache?

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.620
Also you need to determine how many
cache misses do we have in this sequence

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.930
of accesses and how many write-backs to
memory will happen during the sequence.
