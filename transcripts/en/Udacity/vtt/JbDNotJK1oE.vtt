00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.180
The connection between production systems and

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:06.510
human cognition is both powerful and straightforward. In fact,

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.590
production systems, right from the beginning were proposed as models of

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.880
human cognition. We can look at it from several perspectives. First,

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.540
the working memory in production system has a counterpart in human cognition in

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.560
the form of short-term memory. Short-term memory and human cognition,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.900
at least for the verbal part, has a capacity for approximately seven plus or

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.540
minus two elements. Working memory and production systems plays a similar role.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.245
Second, people have connected studies which they have given the same problems,

00:00:42.245 --> 00:00:47.060
both to humans and to cognitive architectures [INAUDIBLE]. These problems

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.700
typically are from closed worlds like arithmetic or algebra. At a consult,

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.600
there are strong similarities between the behavior of programs like SOAR and

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.800
the behavior of humans when they address problems in arithmetic and algebra.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.980
This, however, does not mean that we already have a very good complete model of

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:12.030
human cognition. This is just the beginning. Humans engage in a very large

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.160
number of problems, not just arithmetic or algebra problems in closed worlds.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.290
So there still remain a large number of questions open about how do you build

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.370
a cognitive architecture that can capture human cognition at large in the open?
