GUEST SPEAKER: Dear
Governor, as you

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.180
know, we're currently
facing a controversy

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.210
around the funding for cleanup
of a highly polluted Superfund

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.680
site.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.240
Before delving
into some details,

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.560
I wanted to divide my
talk into three parts.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.560
First, I'll walk you
through why this has become

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.940
a controversial topic today.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.910
Secondly, I'll walk
you through how

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.650
you can apply
cost-benefit analysis

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.994
in this particular case.

00:00:30.994 --> 00:00:32.910
And finally, I'll close
with some observations

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.630
around possible gaps
and recommendations

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.970
on how to move forward.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.520
So first some background.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.090
A decade ago some abandoned
underground storage tanks

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.660
from a former foundry leaked
into neighboring wetlands.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.242
Given that the company
had gone out of business,

00:00:48.242 --> 00:00:49.950
it was impossible to
hold them to account

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.210
for the cost of the cleanup.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.630
As a result, we put in $3
million to cap the site

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.420
and sequester the
polluted water and soil.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.730
Today this issues resurfaced
because the city wants

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.950
to build a new mall on
the site and has requested

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.670
that the state government fund
the construction of a road that

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.379
would link this area
near an interstate.

00:01:08.379 --> 00:01:09.920
This sparked debate
around who should

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.220
fund the cleanup, which is
estimated to cost $35 million.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.845
The local government argues
that the economic benefits

00:01:16.845 --> 00:01:19.470
of the mall on this site will be
widespread so the state should

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.970
cover these costs.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.387
However, the
transportation agency

00:01:22.387 --> 00:01:24.845
believes that the developers
should cover these costs given

00:01:24.845 --> 00:01:26.940
that they will gain much
of the economic benefits.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.550
To develop a position, you asked
me to work on a cost benefit

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.800
analysis, and I'll walk
you through the process

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.757
of this analysis.

00:01:33.757 --> 00:01:35.840
As you know the purpose
of a cost benefit analysis

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.260
is to determine whether
the social benefits exceed

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.970
the social costs.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.880
The benefits are an increase
in the human environmental

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.190
well-being, while the
costs are the reductions

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.600
in this well-being.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.090
To sum the benefits, we would
calculate the willingness

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.400
to pay for benefits
or accept compensation

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.710
for any losses that might occur.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.970
We also determine the
standing, in other words,

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.780
the stakeholders whose costs and
benefits are to be considered,

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.030
and the time over which
these costs and benefits are

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.249
to be counted and
discounted over time.

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:07.040
Finally, to compare
the costs and benefits,

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.460
we use that present value.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.644
In other words, the discount
of these values over time.

00:02:11.644 --> 00:02:13.310
And then that present
value is important

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.020
because it helps us
rank our options.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.700
And we should only
consider implementing

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.130
those that have a positive
net present value.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.566
For this particular
case here are

00:02:21.566 --> 00:02:22.940
some of the most
important direct

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.570
and indirect costs and benefits
that we could focus on.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.085
Some of the potential costs
of development of this mall

00:02:29.085 --> 00:02:30.710
would be the actual
cleanup of the site

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.520
and the ongoing monitoring of
any lingering contamination,

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.600
certifying compliance
and authorizing

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.110
sites for redevelopment,
building, maintaining a road

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.400
or necessary structures such
as bridges or parking lots,

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.072
loss of revenue of existing
local and state businesses,

00:02:47.072 --> 00:02:49.280
increased traffic, as well
as air and noise pollution

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.710
in the area and any resulting
shifts in demographics

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.960
of these areas.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.930
Some potential benefits
could be economic activity

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.494
and generation of business
revenues, employments, wages,

00:03:00.494 --> 00:03:02.660
and benefits that can affect
household income, which

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.740
in turn can propel the economy,
and state and local taxes

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.281
can increase revenue
for the government.

00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:11.280
It's important to note
that many of these issues

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.490
can be seen as either
cost or benefits

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.832
depending on different
stakeholders point of view.

00:03:15.832 --> 00:03:17.290
For example, a
large new mall could

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.498
increase the property value
in some surrounding areas

00:03:19.498 --> 00:03:21.555
and decrease it in others.

00:03:21.555 --> 00:03:22.930
As far as time
frame, it would be

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.596
important to capture
each phase involved

00:03:24.596 --> 00:03:26.610
from the cleanup of the
development construction

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.650
to its functioning
in the long-term,

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.139
so we can project the potential
long-term costs and benefits.

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:33.680
Ideally, a lot of
psychoanalysis that

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.763
captures the impacts of
the mall from construction

00:03:35.763 --> 00:03:38.420
to deconstruction
would be carried out.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.250
Regarding the
geographic scope, it's

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.551
key to include in the
study the actual site

00:03:43.551 --> 00:03:45.050
plus a certain
radius of surrounding

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.520
areas and neighboring towns
to ensure that cost benefit

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.580
analysis gains the full picture
of the impacts of the project.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.880
Each cost benefit would
require a different scope

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.520
depending on the impact
and how far it would

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.350
reach the surrounding areas.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:58.850
Consultation with
local stakeholders

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.460
can be helpful in
determining the scope.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.070
Finally, regarding the question
of inevitable distribution

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.550
of costs and benefits.

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.714
We may give higher
weight of cost benefit

00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:10.130
for particular stakeholders
who may experience the impacts

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.650
at different rates due
to particular situations

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.705
or locations such as
indigenous peoples

00:04:14.705 --> 00:04:18.760
with cultural and physical
survival may be at stake.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.517
Those who are negatively
affected by it

00:04:20.517 --> 00:04:22.350
would carry higher
costs, and therefore that

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.320
should be factored in.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.930
To wrap up, I just wanted to
offer some recommendations

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.304
and closing thoughts.

00:04:28.304 --> 00:04:29.720
One, issues that
we're discussing,

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.780
two, scenarios
keeping the site as is

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.850
or conducting cleanup for a
new development such as a mall.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.550
To make an informed decision and
given that environmental groups

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.830
claim that there have
been long-term health

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.920
effects experienced by
water users in the area,

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.570
it would be key to carry out
environmental health risk

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.310
analysis of the
current site, so we

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.890
know what we're comparing the
action of redevelopment to.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.490
In this case, non-monetary
costs and benefits

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.880
should be given a score so
that the two options of action

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.509
and non-action can be compared.

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:00.050
Moreover, I would also encourage
us to consider other options

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.215
aside from the
construction of a mall

00:05:02.215 --> 00:05:03.340
as a form of redevelopment.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.000
It would be
important to consider

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.650
other alternatives
that might generate

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.350
higher benefit at a lower cost.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.660
Taking these steps and
conducting a cost benefit

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.820
analysis will give us a
more comprehensive picture

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.970
of the situation and fill
in some important gaps

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.770
of information that
we currently face

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.790
to make an informed decision.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.700
A well done cost
benefit analysis

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.510
will help us determine
which course of action,

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.950
as well as how much each party
should contribute to make

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.140
this plan actually happen.

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.990
Thank you.
