00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.940
Perhaps the biggest crime of Atlantis: Milo's Return is that,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.640
despite a very obviously cheap animation budget and,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.200
oh, I don't know, obvious identity as a cheap cash-in,

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.720
(which is strange, seeing as how the first film was not a huge box-office hit),

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.640
it's that, at first, it actually kind of has an interesting story.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.680
Yeah, at first, I was kinda sucked in by it.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.260
Despite all the bad jokes and awkward drawn scenes, and...

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.600
alright, let's look at the story.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.160
Milo is still living with Kida in Atlantis,

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.520
but all his friends return, saying that, apparently, some sort of Atlantian monster is attacking a bunch of ships.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.880
Confused by this, Kida journeys to the surface world, bringing Milo along with her,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.860
and they try to figure out if this monster is an actual monster or one of the Atlantian machines, or...

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.640
...maybe something else...

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.720
...or even SOMEONE else.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.880
They go on land, come across this creepy village, talk to all these semi-creepy people,

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.060
and the more and more they find out about this mystery, the more questions it seems to raise.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.560
There's actually a lot of talking, and even kind of ominous dread,

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.340
and I mean that in the best way.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.200
Even though it wasn't animated the best, I was actually finding it kind of interesting.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.460
But here's the thing:

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.300
when they DO find out what's going on and what's behind it,

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.380
it seems to raise even more questions.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.520
Well, that's fine, but we never get the answers.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.420
There's questions about where the person who's doing this came from,

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.140
and how he's able to do what he's doing.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.820
Is he even doing what he's doing?

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.200
Is he controlling the monsters, the monster controlling him?

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.040
How can he possess other people?  IS he possessing other people?

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.300
It looks like he has to look into their eyes - wait, now he doesn't need to look in their eyes.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.360
How does this work?

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.560
And just as it's getting interesting, they completely drop the story.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.740
Yeah, they defeat the bad guy, and then they go to a completely different story.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.660
Now it takes place in the wild west, and there's these wind coyotes, and

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.800
I don't know, some guy's shit is stolen, and they have to get it back

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.980
but there's this Native American who can control the wind coyotes,

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.020
and it somehow connects to the Atlantian stuff?

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.620
But it doesn't stop there; it then goes to ANOTHER story where this crazy guy thinks he's Odin

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.480
and he steals the spear that has Atlantian technology

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.360
which actually kinda makes him Odin now,

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.120
and he confuses Kida for his daughter, BrÃ¼nnhilde, and...shit!

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.560
This is just another pilot for a TV show, isn't it?

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.200
That explains why the animation looks this way and why all the stories don't really connect that well.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.320
Damn it!  At least with Tarzan and Jane, I knew it was going to be a pilot to a TV show.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.760
This...this TRIED harder, and fooled me into thinking it was going to be something that tries hard throughout the whole thing.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.440
I guess it does technically have an ending, and, yeah, actually, the ending's not that bad.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.080
It even kind of retcons the ending of the first film, but

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.620
it's weird; when you see the choice she makes, you understand her reasoning,

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.220
but there's also, like, a ton of dangers that happen throughout this film to go against her reasoning, too.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.200
I'm not saying what happens is the wrong choice;

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.740
I'm saying they never explain the actual dangers that could come along with it,

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.760
and that's very important to address.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.980
*sigh* So, yeah, I guess, in terms of other technicals,

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.740
the voice actors are all replacements, and they do a good job.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.400
The animation, like I said, is a huge budget cut,

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.600
but for kind-of-TV animation, I guess it's fine.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.940
Sometimes, there's a really inventive idea,

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.600
like, there's this annoying dog that kind of sucks, but

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.960
he was born in molten lava, so he'll constantly do things, like just sleep in a fireplace.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.980
That's kind of creative.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.880
And, again, when they're actually kind of talking about this Atlantian stuff,

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.580
it IS kind of interesting, kind of like the first film, in that respect.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.040
But, sadly, it just doesn't stay focused, and I don't even know if it was actually meant to stay focused.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.580
This was probably supposed to be three episodes that were going to be connected,

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.940
like I said, as a pilot of a TV show,

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.000
a TV show that never got off the ground.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.560
I mean, OK, I don't have confirmation of this, but...

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.280
if it WASN'T, then this really is the most fragmented direct-to-DVD sequel, ever.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:00.080
So, I guess it's not awful; it's just...not needed, and not that interesting through the majority of it,

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.040
like I said, with the exception of that first third.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.360
But, even then, that's not great;

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.480
it's just telling an interesting story that never really has any conclusion or answers.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.660
I guess, if you REALLY liked the first Atlantis movie,

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.160
and you just want to see a little bit more of the technology world and ideas,

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.460
you'll get hints of it here,

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:22.360
but if you're looking for something more, this is something that should definitely stay...sunk.
