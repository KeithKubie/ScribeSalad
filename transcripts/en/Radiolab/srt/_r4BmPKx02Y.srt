1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,690
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert
Krulwich. This is radio lab,

2
00:00:03,691 --> 00:00:07,410
and today we've been investigating
the truth, the fact of the matter,

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,670
and this next segment to set it up.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,790
I guess all I really want to say is it
sometimes getting to the fact of the

5
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:18,480
matter, a fact of the matter,
the way Arrow just did.

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,210
That can be tricky. Yeah.

7
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:24,810
You end up finding things that you didn't
expect that are way more complicated

8
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:27,840
than you expected. The story
begins with our producer,

9
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,710
Pat Walters started for him when he
was talking with an ex CIA agent.

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,090
So maybe you've taken me to,
was this the summer of 1981?

11
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,470
Okay. In the summer of 1981,

12
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,520
I was being transferred from a
one overseas post to another.

13
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:47,660
This is a mural [inaudible]
and I'm a retired CIA officer.

14
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:52,340
But in 1981 Merle was still at the CIA
and he was posted out in the sticks out

15
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:56,570
and in the Boonies, somewhere in
Southeast Asia. And, and, and why,

16
00:00:56,571 --> 00:00:59,510
why were you [inaudible]? Yeah, I had,

17
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,960
I had a little disagreement with my, uh,

18
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:07,970
previous chief and I ended
up in, uh, in this remote,

19
00:01:07,971 --> 00:01:10,880
a jungle backwater, I guess
is the best way to phrase it.

20
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,770
Can you say what country
you in? Um, I'd rather not.

21
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:17,970
Oh.

22
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,410
In any case, as much as Merle
did not want to be there,

23
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:24,520
it turned out that this little backwater
was ground zero for what was about to

24
00:01:24,521 --> 00:01:27,370
become one of the strangest
stories of the Cold War.

25
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,640
Just to set the scene.
The story happens in Laos,

26
00:01:31,641 --> 00:01:34,700
which is that kind of narrow country
between Vietnam and Thailand.

27
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,620
The time is a few years after the
Vietnam War, right after the war,

28
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,490
U s army left pulled out all of
our troops and once we were gone,

29
00:01:43,491 --> 00:01:45,410
the communists basically
took over the region,

30
00:01:45,411 --> 00:01:48,500
the communist being the Vietcong
and their allies and Laos,

31
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:52,660
the path at Lao group,
outdoor Lucia Chateau,

32
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,740
gee, it was may of 1975. All
of a sudden, the Vietcong,

33
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,490
the Pathet Lao had infiltrated and they
were all over our village and I knew

34
00:02:00,491 --> 00:02:01,720
that the Americans had left.

35
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,110
This is an Yang. Robin and I
spoke with him and his niece.

36
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,310
Kalia translated for us.
[inaudible] lives in Minneapolis,

37
00:02:09,311 --> 00:02:12,850
but in 1975 he lived in a tiny
village in the mountains of Laos.

38
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,810
[inaudible] is part of a tribe
called the Mon and inc says,

39
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,340
as soon as the Americans left,

40
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,700
Lao and Vietnamese soldiers
showed up in his village,

41
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:22,810
there was a hundred of them.

42
00:02:22,811 --> 00:02:27,700
They came in cars and in a way you could
say they were out for revenge because

43
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:28,660
during Vietnam War,

44
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,130
thousands of Mong soldiers had fought on
our side and as soon as we were out of

45
00:02:33,131 --> 00:02:37,800
the picture, that's when
the killing started. Thanks.

46
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,660
As it began with isolated attacks,

47
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,830
[inaudible] pod villagers started
getting killed in random fields.

48
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:48,180
[inaudible] they just find one of their
neighbors shot dead in his rice patty

49
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:52,710
one day or a woman would go
fetch water and never come back.

50
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,770
Yellow car show done a partial for long.

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,810
It was a village and I know
the name of the village.

52
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:00,250
I know the name of the
village chief, the pathic Lao,

53
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:03,670
which again is the communist army in
Laos had gotten suspicious that these

54
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:05,890
villagers may have been
hiding guns in the jungle,

55
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,820
like plotting to rebel against
the government. So one day,

56
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,460
but that law went over and you
thought, or the whole village,

57
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,120
that's when we knew that the laws of
humanity had been, had been terminated

58
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,900
and not long after that.

59
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,300
And in his family long with thousands
of other mung flood their villages when

60
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,270
the hiding in the jungle,

61
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,500
this is where things stood when
Merle got his assignment and um,

62
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,690
before he left DC and flew over to Asia,

63
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:38,750
I stopped in our headquarters and while
I was there I was briefed by our desk

64
00:03:39,091 --> 00:03:42,150
officer who told him about what
was happening with communist raids,

65
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,140
the on fleeing.

66
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,370
But then the desk officer
said something kind of odd.

67
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:52,890
There had been these reports
from refugees, refugees,
like an about this yellow,

68
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,010
these yellow droplets
falling from the air.

69
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:00,920
[inaudible]

70
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,620
PBS went out to the camps and
interviewed some of the refugees,

71
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,150
Wendy and crab who, oh, area.

72
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:09,350
I said this yellow stuff that was falling
out of the sky was coming from planes.

73
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:13,700
We only saw the powders free prom.
Yet some refugees talked about powder,

74
00:04:13,701 --> 00:04:16,760
some talked about liquid, you
know a yellow miss sometimes,

75
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,010
but they all said whatever
this was. When it landed,

76
00:04:19,011 --> 00:04:22,730
it mean people buy a mentally ill and
they all talked about how after this stuff

77
00:04:22,731 --> 00:04:25,610
fell from the sky, when did
powder reach the ground?

78
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:29,060
It's dark on everything
left behind is yellow spots.

79
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,270
Well now you know yellow drops
everywhere all over the landscape.

80
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,890
Ang remember the first time
you saw it? Oh, show it Amanda.

81
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:40,620
She was hiding in the woods somewhere
and somebody came running into him and

82
00:04:40,621 --> 00:04:43,230
said, Ang, you have to come
and see this yellow stuff.

83
00:04:43,231 --> 00:04:44,670
Just fell on a village up on the hill,

84
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:49,560
ran up the hill and sort of crashed
out of the forest and just stopped.

85
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:51,090
No,

86
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,770
right there at the edge of the
village, a glued Lucia toe.

87
00:04:54,771 --> 00:04:56,430
I learned let p electronic too.

88
00:04:56,431 --> 00:05:00,990
I saw my dad call and two dead pigs and
several dead chicken and all the people

89
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,990
who've been exposed, they, they
were all having stomach trouble.

90
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,240
Ink says people were doubled over
carving their stomach writhing in pain,

91
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,100
throwing up some, throwing up blood

92
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,490
[inaudible] things that
people began to suffer from.

93
00:05:13,491 --> 00:05:16,580
Everything from diarrhea
to headaches, rashes.

94
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,850
There was a person, and I have the
photo right here in my keeping a,

95
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:24,220
her Capa Ma, who had been exposed in her
eyes, her eyes were destroyed entirely,

96
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,590
and many people inc says, didn't
recover. What I saw was people dying,

97
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,840
they wouldn't get better. They would die.

98
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,920
Hmm. Marel says the thought in CIA was
that this might be some kind of chemical

99
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:40,660
weapon, right? Did it have a name at
that point? Yellow rain, yellow rain.

100
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:45,510
By the time Marel got to Southeast Asia,
hundreds of these reports had come in.

101
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,160
Hundreds and several thousand people
had been reported killed by this stuff.

102
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,650
But you know, in those kinds of situations
and in Southeast Asia, generally,

103
00:05:52,651 --> 00:05:54,140
you know there are tons of rumors,

104
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,890
but you have to be careful of what
you believe, what you don't believe,

105
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,150
and you have to rely on evidence,

106
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:02,600
which they just didn't have
no until all of a sudden

107
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,233
they did.

108
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:08,480
Just a few months after Maura got there
and they started getting these reports

109
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,840
that refugees and collected
samples off of leaves,

110
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,110
some refugees had shown up with
leaves covered in these yellow spots.

111
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,930
Here's a closeout where I see, look again,

112
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:22,310
this is Matt Mussels and he's at Harvard
chemists and chemical weapons expert.

113
00:06:22,311 --> 00:06:25,220
The U S government asks to help
examine these samples. Yeah,

114
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,000
I went up and visited him in his office
in Cambridge. Here's some on leaves.

115
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,520
These are only leaves rug
back. These are all dried out.

116
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:33,950
Now this leaves are small, black, brittle,

117
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,910
which only makes the spot stand out even
more because there's this incredible

118
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:41,750
bright yellow. They're tiny. They're
there two or three millimeters across.

119
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,291
And that says,

120
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:45,470
when scientists put these leaves under a
microscope and looked inside the yellow

121
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:50,080
spots, they saw that the spots had a
very high content of toxin called t two

122
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,430
which is a poison. And while
T2 does grow in nature,

123
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:00,210
the concentrations that they found in
these spots was way too high to have

124
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:03,660
occurred naturally in which demonstrated
that this was, you know, in fact a, uh,

125
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,090
a new type of a chemical weapon.

126
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:08,490
Okay.

127
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,550
We now had physical evidence.

128
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:15,530
This is secretary of State
Alexander Haig, the fall of 1981,

129
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:20,580
which has been analyzed and found to
contain abnormally high levels of potent

130
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:26,330
mycotoxins and eating poisonous
substance in the United States.

131
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:30,370
Said today it has evidence that chemical
warfare has been waged in parts of

132
00:07:30,371 --> 00:07:34,090
Southeast Asia. The U s obtained
a test sample of twigs and leaves.

133
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:37,510
Chemical analysis found high
levels of three toxic chemicals.

134
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,190
The news of this poisonous yellow rain
became an instant political crisis.

135
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,090
Refugees in camps along the Thai border
had been telling for years of a yellow

136
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:49,200
rain or rain that was followed in
limits by vomiting, bleeding, and death.

137
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:53,160
Because everybody knew the
Lao and Vietnamese armies
were not capable of making

138
00:07:53,161 --> 00:07:57,750
this stuff. No Vietnam could
not even make their own rifles.

139
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,400
They were pretty backward in that sense,

140
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:03,300
which really left only one likely suspect
circumstantial evidence points to the

141
00:08:03,301 --> 00:08:07,800
Russians. The Soviet Union may be engaging
in biological warfare. The Soviets,

142
00:08:07,801 --> 00:08:09,390
of course denied. They were involved.

143
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,410
Soviets said it was a slanderous
accusation that the u s government did not

144
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:14,850
believe them. Show me your union.

145
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:20,030
Their allies are violating the Geneva
Protocol of 1925 and in the summer of 1982

146
00:08:20,251 --> 00:08:21,410
in a speech to the UN,

147
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:25,440
President Reagan officially accused
the Soviet Union of supplying and using

148
00:08:25,441 --> 00:08:27,270
chemical weapons in Southeast Asia.

149
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,560
There is conclusive evidence that the
Soviet government has provided toxins for

150
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:34,230
you should allow and camp
a chia. Three years later,

151
00:08:34,231 --> 00:08:37,770
Congress passed legislation authorizing
the production of a chemical bomb called

152
00:08:37,771 --> 00:08:39,660
the big guy, the 500 pound bomb,

153
00:08:39,661 --> 00:08:42,810
and it's been to be carried on high
performance here and within two years in

154
00:08:42,811 --> 00:08:44,490
factory in pen bluff, Arkansas,

155
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,070
again churning out thousands of bounds
designed to carry Sarah and gas. Really?

156
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,153
I don't know why

157
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:55,963
[inaudible]

158
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,550
this would be the first time the United
States had manufactured a chemical

159
00:08:59,551 --> 00:09:01,770
weapon in nearly 20 years.

160
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,620
All this in effect because
of the yellow rain.

161
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,240
Ooh,

162
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,610
but before we jump ahead, in the,

163
00:09:10,611 --> 00:09:15,611
in November of 1982 they were two
days of press briefings by the State

164
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,570
Department, and this is where
things really start to get weird.

165
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,420
The State Department had gotten
everybody together to explain it.

166
00:09:24,421 --> 00:09:27,900
Some British scientists had looked at
the spots and in addition to the poison,

167
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,940
they found something else.

168
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:35,040
All the samples had a very high
content of pollen from flowers,

169
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,750
which initially didn't make any
sense like why would pollen be toxic?

170
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:43,890
But eventually the government officials
came to this kind of terrifying

171
00:09:43,891 --> 00:09:46,530
conclusion that in fact, this was a very,

172
00:09:46,531 --> 00:09:49,320
very clever communist mixture.

173
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:53,610
Somehow the Russians had found a way to
use pollen as a vector to transmit this

174
00:09:53,611 --> 00:09:57,900
toxin. If it falls right on your skin,
it would intoxicate you poison you,

175
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:01,200
but if these drops should
fall on a leaf or a rock,

176
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,730
then the wind would read,
disperse these Poland Greens,

177
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,180
which we've just the right diameter
to penetrate to the dip the lungs,

178
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,150
thereby making it a more deadly weapon.

179
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:19,200
Matt remembers hearing that and thinking
that just seemed completely bonkers to

180
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,540
me. I knew a lot about chemical weapons.

181
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,730
And you'd never heard of
anything like that before? No.

182
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,640
So he sent some of these samples
around to other scientists.

183
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:29,490
He knew in one afternoon he's sitting
in his lab and he gets a call.

184
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:32,820
I remember the phone call is the
guy who called and Tom Sealy.

185
00:10:32,821 --> 00:10:37,260
I'm a professor in the department of
Neurobiology and behavior at Cornell

186
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,080
University. Matt pick up the
phone. Tom said to him, Hey,

187
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,770
I analyzed the samples you
sent me, and then he said,

188
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:47,970
the State Department
explanation is not parsimonious,

189
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:53,520
meaning meaning this yellow stuff is
not a chemical weapon. Then he paused.

190
00:10:53,521 --> 00:10:56,190
He said it's B, and then
he used a four letter word.

191
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,800
I think we can use that word
because that all right. Yeah.

192
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,233
You said it was beaten

193
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,330
[inaudible]

194
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:05,390
what these what we call
fecal spot of Honeybee

195
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,033
[inaudible]

196
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,880
that was their idea. Yeah. They
were like, look, here's the thing.

197
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,450
Every winter bees kind of
hibernate during the winter.

198
00:11:14,451 --> 00:11:17,240
There are no flowers and there
is no Pauline, there's no nectar.

199
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,290
There's nothing for the bees to go out
and collect so that they stay inside

200
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,470
confined to their hives all winter
feeding their babies fattening up the new

201
00:11:24,471 --> 00:11:28,340
worker bees for the next season.
And since they're very fastidious,

202
00:11:28,341 --> 00:11:32,420
they do not defecate in their nests.
They don't poop all winter. Right.

203
00:11:32,421 --> 00:11:34,370
So the become immensely constipated.

204
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,820
And then on the first warm days,

205
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:42,850
they all fly out on mass to like
a hundred feet off the ground.

206
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,650
[inaudible]

207
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:52,600
all at the same time. It is called the
cleansing flight in anybody who cultures,

208
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,070
bees. And if you get caught
beneath the situation, Tom says,

209
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,880
it feels like light raindrops hitting
your arms, hitting your forehead.

210
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:04,290
So this was their theory that the
yellow rain was not a chemical weapon,

211
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,120
it was just be droppings. They published
this and the government was like,

212
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:10,563
seriously,

213
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,980
even a bunch of prestigious scientists
came forward and said that it was an

214
00:12:14,981 --> 00:12:18,370
absurd explanation. Kind of
crazy and embarrassing a,

215
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,980
let's not forget that
this rain was toxic and B,

216
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:23,260
honeybees and southeast
Asia don't even hibernate.

217
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:26,560
There is no winter in Southeast
Asia. It's the tropics.

218
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:31,090
So Southeast Asian bees
never get constipated and
they never do the big poop.

219
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,700
Those Eric, good objections. No,

220
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:37,840
Matt and Tom Counter by going to Thailand
12 and I flew out there and they go

221
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:41,620
into the jungle plants and beehives and
one day they're staring up at a high end

222
00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:45,200
in the flesh. They see it happen.
The bees shoot up into the sky

223
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,840
and within a minute or two after that

224
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,430
we started to get rained
upon by the [inaudible]

225
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,080
B feces. So to tell the government,
sorry, we think it happens here too.

226
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,850
[inaudible] wait, that's only half of
it. I mean what about the toxic part?

227
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:05,200
The whole idea that these bees are
pooping poison. That is a hard one,

228
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,550
but while Matt and Tom were in Thailand,

229
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:12,630
some labs had started retesting those
original samples because you see the

230
00:13:12,631 --> 00:13:16,500
poison had been detected by one particular
lab in Minnesota at the beginning,

231
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,450
but now that these yellow
spots were such a big deal,

232
00:13:18,451 --> 00:13:22,500
other labs all over the world
began to retest them and

233
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:28,390
they couldn't find anything.
British never found trees.

234
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,220
The Swedes never found a trace. The Way
Matt sees it, the analyses were wrong.

235
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,360
He thinks that lab,

236
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:38,110
the lab in Minnesota that had been doing
this work inadvertently contaminated

237
00:13:38,111 --> 00:13:41,170
the pollen because this lab did
lots of other work with Mycotoxins,

238
00:13:41,171 --> 00:13:43,300
large quantities of these toxins.

239
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:46,990
The government obviously wanted to
be sure they did their own rules,

240
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,090
tests of the samples.
They didn't find anything.

241
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,620
They sent a team to Southeast Asia to
verify the bees do the poop shower thing

242
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,040
and they do.

243
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,420
And my friend, it's a good friend
pong tip who was part of that team,

244
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,280
told me that in the bar at the end of
this multiday excursion, off the record,

245
00:14:05,281 --> 00:14:06,480
one of the gentlemen said, well,

246
00:14:06,481 --> 00:14:09,000
I guess we owe the Soviets
and apology on this one,

247
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,990
which hasn't ever happened. In fact,

248
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,130
yellow rain is still,

249
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:18,690
that's morale again in the U S Army
Chemical Corps manual is, you know,

250
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,690
one of the, the possible weapons
that might be used. Oh really? Yeah,

251
00:14:22,691 --> 00:14:24,400
it's still there. It's
still, it's still there.

252
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:29,130
I have a, I have a clarifying question
before I interpreted that. So,

253
00:14:29,131 --> 00:14:32,280
so they found toxins initially and then
when they looked again at those samples

254
00:14:32,281 --> 00:14:36,190
that talk to them were no longer
there. That's right. Okay. A lot. Like,

255
00:14:36,191 --> 00:14:39,300
you know, I had the [inaudible]

256
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,040
at a certain point in our
conversation with Ang, the Hmong guy,

257
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,490
Robin and I talked to earlier with
his niece, Kalia translating for him.

258
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,870
We explained that the evidence they'd
been attacked by chemical weapons seem.

259
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,190
Yeah,

260
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,530
I interpreted that for uncle

261
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:56,400
a little shaky. Hi John [inaudible]. Uh,

262
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,530
[inaudible] ain't response was
if this was just be thesis,

263
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:05,780
how do you explain the kids dying, the,
the people and the animals dying? Uh,

264
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,840
where there is this yellow thing
where there are no bees, um,

265
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:10,520
whole whole villages die.

266
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:15,430
We asked Kalia to tell Ang what the
scientists had told us that the Hmong were

267
00:15:15,431 --> 00:15:18,310
definitely dying. The moment
were under real attack.

268
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:21,390
They were being fired out from
airplanes and by soldiers. And,

269
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,640
but more importantly, even if they
weren't killed by those direct attacks,

270
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:29,170
they were on the run through the jungle
mountain nourished and drinking from

271
00:15:29,171 --> 00:15:33,400
contaminated streams. Diseases like
dysentery and cholera were rampant.

272
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,060
And the way a lot of people see
it is that they may have missed,

273
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:41,700
attributed some of those mysterious deaths
to this cloud of bee poop that looked

274
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:44,080
like it could have been a chemical weapon.

275
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:48,960
Hi, John Gig with hydro
Noosa. The Ang says no more

276
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:54,130
[inaudible] not a chance
to what I've seen,

277
00:15:54,131 --> 00:15:57,880
and there is no inkling in my mind
that those deaths were not caused by

278
00:15:57,881 --> 00:16:01,930
starvation. Dysentery. It was chemicals
that with our killing my people.

279
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,500
So we wanted to know, and
this was an honest question,

280
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:08,950
did he see something that would
contradict the scientist story?

281
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,820
Did the source of the rain,

282
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:16,590
was there always a plane and then rain
plane and then rain or did sometimes the

283
00:16:16,591 --> 00:16:17,910
rain happen without a plane?

284
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:30,840
[inaudible] [inaudible] we never saw what
they said was that it was always just

285
00:16:30,841 --> 00:16:32,940
being dropped on them. And it will always,

286
00:16:32,941 --> 00:16:36,510
always be in drop where there are heavy
concentrations of Hmong people. Hmm.

287
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:41,190
But that's what we knew. We don't know
whether there was a plane causing it.

288
00:16:41,191 --> 00:16:43,920
It was just you just
see the dust or see the,

289
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:47,610
you have to understand that the planes
are shooting bullets and bombs every day,

290
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,970
all the time. And so,

291
00:16:49,971 --> 00:16:53,550
so whether it was a bombing plane or
a yellow plane was incredibly hard to

292
00:16:53,551 --> 00:16:56,880
distinguish. [inaudible]

293
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:59,280
everybody runs when you
hear the plane. So mom,

294
00:16:59,281 --> 00:17:01,470
people don't watch bombs
coming down. You came out,

295
00:17:01,471 --> 00:17:04,230
you sneak your head out and you
watch what happened in the aftermath.

296
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,300
You saw broken trees,
you saw yellow in the,

297
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,130
in the aftermath of what had been bombed.

298
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:14,830
[inaudible] Ma [inaudible] I saw with my
own eyes that [inaudible] on the leaves

299
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:19,420
eating two holes with my own eyes. I
saw Paul and that could kill the grass,

300
00:17:19,421 --> 00:17:21,280
could kill leaves, could kill trees,

301
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:26,550
but he himself is not clear whether
it's the bee stuff or whether it's other

302
00:17:27,581 --> 00:17:31,330
stuff, because there was so much
stuff coming down from the sky.

303
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,533
[inaudible] [inaudible]

304
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,980
[inaudible] [inaudible]
you know that, that,

305
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,020
that were chemicals being that being
used against the mall in the mountains of

306
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:47,470
Laos,

307
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:51,270
whether this is the chemicals from the
bom or yellow rain chemicals were being

308
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:56,010
used, it feels to him like this is
a semantic debate and it feels like,

309
00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:00,050
um, there's a sad lack
of justice that, that,

310
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,270
that the word of a man who survived
this thing must be pitted against a

311
00:18:03,271 --> 00:18:07,280
professor from Harvard who's read these
accounts. Um, as far as I can tell,

312
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,370
your uncle didn't see the bee pollen fall.

313
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:14,100
Your uncle didn't see a plane.

314
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,680
All of this is hearsay.

315
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:23,800
[inaudible].

316
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,680
What's your [inaudible] [inaudible]

317
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,740
my uncle says, um, for the last 20
years he didn't know that anything,

318
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:34,790
anybody was interested in the death
among people that you bargain.

319
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:38,550
He agreed to do this interview because
you were interested in to know what

320
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:42,330
happened to them about what happened and
the world has has been on interest for

321
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:45,000
the last 20 years. He agreed
because you were interested.

322
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:49,110
She took a gay more attractive that the
story would be hurt and at the moment

323
00:18:49,111 --> 00:18:51,360
that's who'd be documented and recognized.

324
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,990
That's why you agreed to the interview
that the moral heart is broken,

325
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:59,070
that our leaders have been silenced and
what we know has been questioned again

326
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:01,800
and again. It's not a
surprise to him or to me.

327
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:03,163
Okay.

328
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,640
I agreed to the interview for the same
reason the radio lab was interested in

329
00:19:08,641 --> 00:19:12,480
the Hmong story that they were interested
in, documented the dust that happened.

330
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,790
There was so much that was not told.

331
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,750
Everybody knows that chemical warfare
was being used. How do you create bombs?

332
00:19:18,751 --> 00:19:21,180
If not what chemicals? We
can play the semantics game.

333
00:19:21,181 --> 00:19:24,990
We can but I'm not interest
in. My uncle is not interested.

334
00:19:24,991 --> 00:19:28,710
We have lost too much heart in
too many people in the process.

335
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,303
What

336
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,750
I I think that, I think
the interview is done.

337
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,943
Okay

338
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,280
now. Um,

339
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,750
nope that wasn't the end of the interview.

340
00:19:59,751 --> 00:20:03,920
They kept on talking Robert and bad
explained to Kalia that we know we're

341
00:20:03,921 --> 00:20:05,960
reporters. We're just trying
to figure out what happened.

342
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,060
One thing I do want to make clear,

343
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:14,030
we informed the gangs in advance that
we wanted to talk about the controversy

344
00:20:14,031 --> 00:20:16,610
surrounding yellow rain. We
were very clear about that.

345
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,360
We did not intend to ambush them,
but this interview troubled us.

346
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,340
We talked about it for months arguing
back and forth about what it meant to the

347
00:20:25,341 --> 00:20:29,260
story, what it meant for
us personally and uh,

348
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,870
we decided at a certain point to bring
that conversation into the studio.

349
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,830
We're going to play you that conversation
as we originally podcast and then

350
00:20:36,831 --> 00:20:38,390
we'll have some things
to say on the other end.

351
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,310
Okay.

352
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:44,250
That started by a talking about the
moment that you just heard on tape

353
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,130
that somehow that

354
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:51,280
moment was when the whole
story changed for me.

355
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:58,520
How exactly like I think that
there was something about

356
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:04,490
like the way that she was pointing away
from the thing that we had been looking

357
00:21:04,491 --> 00:21:09,470
so hard at and saying, stop
looking at that. Look over here.

358
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,490
Yeah.

359
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:14,390
Like she like she didn't convince me at
all that this wasn't a chemical weapon,

360
00:21:14,391 --> 00:21:19,220
but she convinced me that
we were missing something.

361
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,850
Yeah. What I'm hearing her say there,

362
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:26,600
not having been in this interview is
quit focusing on this yellow rain stuff

363
00:21:26,601 --> 00:21:30,500
because when you do that, you're
shoving aside the much larger story,

364
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:34,370
namely that my people were being killed.
Right. So you're what she's saying.

365
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,020
So you're wrong.

366
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:40,970
That is absolutely into my mind. That
is not fair to us. How is it not fair?

367
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:46,900
It's not fair to ask us to not consider
the other stories and the other frames

368
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:50,480
of this story. The fact that the
most powerful man in the world,

369
00:21:50,481 --> 00:21:55,310
Ronald Reagan used this story to order
the manufacturer of chemical weapons for

370
00:21:55,311 --> 00:21:56,720
the first time in 20 years.

371
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:01,140
If the United States with the manufacturer
chemical weapons again and then use

372
00:22:01,141 --> 00:22:06,140
them because the Russians supposedly
had, then people would have died.

373
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,300
Ugly deaths in the consequence of
that, and that is not unimportant.

374
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,120
That's hugely important, but
it's not important to her.

375
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:17,420
So should that not be
important to us, but I, yeah,

376
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:22,190
I mean she's saying
think that, I dunno. I,

377
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:25,610
I think that until she,

378
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:29,450
until she said the things that she
said at the end of that interview,

379
00:22:29,451 --> 00:22:33,680
I don't think that I had
fully appreciated the,

380
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:38,690
the volume of pain that was involved
in that moment for them. Yeah. Yes.

381
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:42,440
I thought, I thought her
reaction was very balancing,

382
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,660
but her desire was not for balance.

383
00:22:44,661 --> 00:22:47,490
Her desire was to monopolize
the story and that we can, sure.

384
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:50,540
We can say that though. Oh, if you
listen to the words, that's okay.

385
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,131
She said No.

386
00:22:51,131 --> 00:22:56,131
I just think that they feel like their
trauma has never been fully acknowledged

387
00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:01,090
and that they've attached it to this
because maybe they felt that they had to,

388
00:23:01,091 --> 00:23:04,600
they've attached it to this idea that
yellow rain was a chemical weapon.

389
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,810
And if yellow rain suddenly isn't
a chemical weapon that doesn't just

390
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,410
unvalidated the yellow rain,
it negates their whole loss.

391
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,190
And I think she might
be right, but it's like,

392
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,850
I also think that the scientists are
right, it's not a chemical weapon.

393
00:23:18,851 --> 00:23:20,890
And I also think you're right that,

394
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:23,680
to call it a chemical
weapon has big consequences.

395
00:23:23,681 --> 00:23:27,820
So what do you do when three
truths are right at the same time?

396
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,440
This is where we stop.

397
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:37,530
So that was our original conversation
and when the podcast went out,

398
00:23:37,531 --> 00:23:42,220
a lot of people were very upset by me
in particular. So I think I want to,

399
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:45,740
if I could add just a couple
of things here. First of all,

400
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:50,600
clearly it was wrong to say that Kalia
Yang was trying to monopolize our

401
00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:52,730
conversation because after
all, we are the editors.

402
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:55,010
We choose what to put on the
air. And in this case we chose,

403
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:59,360
we were looking for evidence that
despite what the scientists thought,

404
00:23:59,361 --> 00:24:03,350
that maybe there was a chemical weapon
here and we wanted to find an eye witness

405
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,400
to see if anybody saw a bomb
open and yellow rain come out.

406
00:24:07,401 --> 00:24:12,200
That's what reporters do. We test
truths. And that is why I was persistent.

407
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:15,890
I had no idea what the youngs were going
to say. And when they got angry, I was,

408
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:20,270
I was embarrassed. And when I got angry
in my conversation with Jed and pat,

409
00:24:20,271 --> 00:24:21,800
that was not right. And for that,

410
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:25,640
I apologize to Kalia and
Mr. Young in particular,

411
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:29,930
I have to ask questions and search
for truth. But in this case,

412
00:24:29,931 --> 00:24:32,000
given how much Mr Yangs
had already suffered,

413
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,220
I should have done it with more respect.
