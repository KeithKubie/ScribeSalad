00:00:10.096 --> 00:00:12.826
&gt;&gt;Carmen: We're going to do one
minute with our eyes closed, two,

00:00:12.826 --> 00:00:14.606
three, four minutes
with our eyes open...

00:00:14.606 --> 00:00:18.076
&gt;&gt;Narrator: This unique
sixth-period elective at AS1 begins

00:00:18.076 --> 00:00:19.676
with a moment of meditation.

00:00:19.676 --> 00:00:20.566
&gt;&gt;Carmen: On your mark.

00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:21.326
Get set. Go.

00:00:22.216 --> 00:00:27.276
&gt;&gt;What happens is the
children learn to be focused.

00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:31.936
They learn to meditate, because just
learning how to be in the presence

00:00:31.936 --> 00:00:33.466
of others is so important.

00:00:34.086 --> 00:00:35.766
Children just chose
to be in the class.

00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:39.176
I didn't go around
and elicit interest,

00:00:39.526 --> 00:00:42.746
and I had the very first
class, which was last April.

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:47.476
I had 12 students, 1 from every
grade, including kindergarten.

00:00:47.906 --> 00:00:53.106
&gt;&gt;Yosi filled out the forum form,
and Yosi wrote "throwing my"...

00:00:53.476 --> 00:00:53.756
&gt;&gt;Kipa.

00:00:54.046 --> 00:00:55.926
&gt;&gt;...kipa like a Frisbee.

00:00:56.286 --> 00:00:59.906
A kipa or a yarmulke is
what Yosi wears on his head.

00:01:00.546 --> 00:01:02.236
&gt;&gt;It's what I believe in.

00:01:03.186 --> 00:01:06.686
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Called "the forum,"
the class is primarily dedicated

00:01:06.686 --> 00:01:10.046
to helping students resolve
their problems peacefully.

00:01:10.486 --> 00:01:13.496
&gt;&gt;Well, he pushed me on the
ground and I pushed him back.

00:01:13.646 --> 00:01:15.266
He grabbed my kipa.

00:01:15.826 --> 00:01:20.286
He was, like, keeping it away
from me, and I grabbed his hair

00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:25.666
and I said, "Give me back my
kipa and I'll let your hair go."

00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:26.086
&gt;&gt;Carmen: Okay.

00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:27.476
Questions for Yosi?

00:01:27.826 --> 00:01:30.026
&gt;&gt;How did you get your kipa back?

00:01:30.026 --> 00:01:32.056
&gt;&gt;It was on the ground
and I picked it up.

00:01:32.516 --> 00:01:33.976
&gt;&gt;So did he grab it, or he...

00:01:34.056 --> 00:01:36.926
&gt;&gt;Carmen: They ask questions for
clarity, and then they figure

00:01:36.926 --> 00:01:41.626
out a way to solve the problem of
these two people who can't figure

00:01:41.626 --> 00:01:44.666
out how to solve the
problem without outside help.

00:01:45.686 --> 00:01:47.626
&gt;&gt;So, Yosi's -- no
offense or anything --

00:01:47.626 --> 00:01:49.586
a little bit smaller than
me, so I didn't see him,

00:01:50.126 --> 00:01:51.886
and when I ran into him he fell over.

00:01:52.686 --> 00:01:56.056
And then he came up and
he tried to kick me,

00:01:56.056 --> 00:01:57.456
and it was like a playful kick.

00:01:57.456 --> 00:01:58.706
I don't think there was any, like...

00:01:59.646 --> 00:02:00.056
&gt;&gt;Carmen: Malice?

00:02:00.256 --> 00:02:01.236
&gt;&gt;Yeah, malice or anything.

00:02:01.726 --> 00:02:03.106
&gt;&gt;Carmen: And I just
think it's very cool,

00:02:03.106 --> 00:02:05.956
because some of the most
insightful questions will be asked

00:02:05.956 --> 00:02:06.666
by first-graders.

00:02:06.986 --> 00:02:11.016
&gt;&gt;Why did you push him back?

00:02:11.016 --> 00:02:13.456
&gt;&gt;I was pretty much really angry.

00:02:13.526 --> 00:02:17.186
&gt;&gt;Carmen: What comes out of it more
than anything is people learn to talk

00:02:17.266 --> 00:02:18.936
to each other and listen
to each other.

00:02:18.996 --> 00:02:21.276
&gt;&gt;I probably should've apologized,
but I just kept on walking.

00:02:21.876 --> 00:02:25.756
&gt;&gt;Carmen: And they learn that there's
another avenue besides hitting

00:02:26.356 --> 00:02:30.476
or screaming or yelling
or going to get someone.

00:02:30.996 --> 00:02:32.616
&gt;&gt;Yosi, what do you need from Levi?

00:02:34.826 --> 00:02:35.866
&gt;&gt;Please do not take my kipa.

00:02:36.476 --> 00:02:37.906
&gt;&gt;Carmen: Can you accommodate that?

00:02:37.906 --> 00:02:39.076
Okay, he needs to hear that.

00:02:39.296 --> 00:02:41.476
&gt;&gt;I won't take your kipa anymore.

00:02:41.476 --> 00:02:41.806
&gt;&gt;Thank you.

00:02:42.426 --> 00:02:46.046
&gt;&gt;Carmen: Do you need
anything else from Levi?

00:02:46.196 --> 00:02:48.846
&gt;&gt;The children learn that
they can become empowered

00:02:49.076 --> 00:02:51.056
and that they can take
care of their own stuff

00:02:51.116 --> 00:02:54.316
and they don't need to
run and get someone.
