[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.771 --> 00:00:07.520
TOM SIDDELL: Thanks,
everyone, for coming.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.312
And thanks for inviting me.

00:00:10.312 --> 00:00:11.052
I'm Tom Siddell.

00:00:11.052 --> 00:00:12.760
I work on the comic,
"Gunnerkrigg Court,"

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.343
which we're going
to talk about today.

00:00:14.343 --> 00:00:17.140
And working on a comic
is pretty solitary.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.270
You know, you work
in a dark room

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:20.872
for a few days on your own.

00:00:20.872 --> 00:00:22.330
And then every once
in a while, you

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.650
resurface and see what
people are saying about you.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.380
So I kind of relish
the opportunity

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.250
to talk about the
comic whenever I can.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.950
Even when I was coming
over to the US this time,

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.320
I was pulled over for
a special question time

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.295
by the US border guards.

00:00:37.295 --> 00:00:38.920
And they were kind
of interested in how

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.470
I was supposed to be supporting
myself here in New York.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.375
And so I was able to sit down
and tell them about my comic.

00:00:47.375 --> 00:00:49.000
And now that I have
a captive audience,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.592
you're going to get
the same talk, I guess.

00:00:51.592 --> 00:00:53.800
And this talk is going to
be roughly a two part talk.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.750
The first part is just
going to be about who I am

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:56.916
and how I started the comic.

00:00:56.916 --> 00:00:59.110
And it's a small
intro into the comic.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.990
But I didn't want
this talk itself

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.830
to be a primer into the
story, because I didn't want

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.810
it to be sort of
the kind of talk

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.090
where you had previous
knowledge of the story.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.030
And I didn't want it to be
for people who were completely

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.210
unfamiliar with the story.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.430
So my background is not comics.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.297
So I can only really
give my perspective

00:01:20.297 --> 00:01:21.130
on comics and stuff.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.680
And if you wanted a more
academic view of comics,

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.140
there's probably better people
to talk about them than I am.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.340
And so I'll keep that
bit fairly short.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.180
The second part of the comic
is what I wanted to focus on.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.764
There are certain
aspects of the comic

00:01:35.764 --> 00:01:38.221
that I wanted to talk about--
in particular, a relationship

00:01:38.221 --> 00:01:39.640
between two of the characters.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.610
And people who are
familiar with the comic

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.660
will know which two they are.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.250
So it might be a
little bit spoilery,

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.830
but rest assured there's a lot
more going on in the story.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.479
And this is just one
very focused look

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:50.770
at some of the things going on.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.720
And anybody who is
new to the story,

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.170
I hope it interests them to
go and find out some more.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.360
And as James said, keep in mind
any questions you might have.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.740
And then at the end, I'll
hopefully get to those.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.350
So I am Tom.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.180
I'm from Birmingham in the UK.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.119
And comics always interested me.

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.660
But when I was
younger, there was not

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.414
much of a comic scene in the UK.

00:02:13.414 --> 00:02:14.830
You had the choice
between "Beano"

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.920
and "Dandy," which were sort
of old, World War II layover

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.820
comics for kids.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.220
And then you had "2000 AD."

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.550
And that's it.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.460
So I didn't find much
there once I grew out

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.930
of the children's comics.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.030
But eventually when
Japanese comics

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.550
started being imported
first into Europe

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.100
and then into the UK, I
got this love of comics

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.020
and realized that they
could be for anybody--

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.220
not just for adults or for
kids, but for anybody really.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.310
And so I was very interested
in the medium of comics.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.670
And I love writing and stuff.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.620
So I wanted to
work my own comics.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.990
But the problem was I
absolutely sucked at drawing.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.830
I was really, really
terrible at it.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.330
And I hated art in school.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.870
And I just didn't think
it was a future for me.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.961
So much to the
relief of my parents,

00:02:59.961 --> 00:03:01.210
I went into computing instead.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.120
As you can, I've got a
certain way with computers.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.530
So I got my degree
in computer science.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.320
And during that
time, I enjoyed it.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.380
But I didn't want it
to be my full career.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.510
Coding itself is
creative in a way.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.470
But it was missing the
artistic element that I really

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.070
wanted to get myself into.

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.460
So after that, after
I got the degree,

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.509
I went into 3D animation.

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:29.800
And then that helped me get
a job in a small video game

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.920
company.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.870
And during that time, I was able
to work on my artwork at home,

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.650
sort of just by myself--

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:37.840
self-taught.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.210
And after a while, I
wanted to start a comic.

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.210
So I set myself
some guidelines just

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.620
to stick to to try and box
myself in and have a project

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.890
to work on.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.910
And so some of the limitations
I set for myself was I

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.910
wanted to be able to work on
it two or three times a week.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.010
I needed to put it
online without fail,

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.130
because I felt that an updated
schedule was really important.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.410
And it was going to
be drawn very simply.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.520
It was going to have flat
colors and hopefully improve

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.990
as the comic went on.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.330
Not quite as simple
as this picture,

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.090
but with scope for
improvement as it went on.

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.290
And as for the layout, nothing
fancy-- just a tried and true

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:17.910
formula.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.170
I wasn't really a fan
of the infinite canvas

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.390
concept of comics where
the whole computer

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.040
screen is your canvas and
you can do unlimited things

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.540
with it.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.999
I wanted something
that potentially

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:29.206
could be printed in the
future, but it was not really

00:04:29.206 --> 00:04:29.710
my end goal.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.090
I also wanted to not alienate
any particular readers.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.220
So when I wrote the
story, I decided

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.920
that I didn't want to
focus on or rely on things

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.810
like violence,
and sex, and gore,

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.920
and swearing, that
sort of thing.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.000
But not write it in such a
way that it was just for kids.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.700
I wanted everybody to read it.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.940
And above all, I wanted it to
be written to my own interests.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.160
And that's one of the things
I learned at university

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.560
was if you're
designing software,

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.330
if you design it
for yourself, you

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.230
have at least one happy user.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.940
And so that's how
I wrote the comics.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.010
And as long as I'm
enjoying it, then I'm

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.580
happy to keep working on it.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.670
And so with that in
mind, what I came up with

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.530
was "Gunnerkrigg Court."

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.830
And the court itself is a
large industrial complex

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.310
that is somewhere in the UK.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.220
It stretches off
into the horizon.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.930
It's impossibly huge.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.700
And it's so big that
even though there's

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.000
many people that live there,
it seems very empty, very

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.190
solitary, very rundown.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.440
And the story is
about two girls that

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.370
live and go to school there.

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.250
And they share the court
with their families

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.000
and their classmates, and also
a bunch of mythical creatures,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.890
and monsters, and robots.

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:46.520
And across from the
court over a big ravine,

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.520
there is a forest which is
similarly huge and winding.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.831
And it's full with
creatures from mythology

00:05:51.831 --> 00:05:53.330
that I was interested
in writing in.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.704
And the reason
why I did this was

00:05:54.704 --> 00:05:57.050
because I couldn't decide
if I wanted to do a science

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.960
fiction or a fantasy story.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.740
So I did both.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.820
And I put them
against each other.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.820
I separated them out physically.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.760
And then I made them
really mad with each other.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.260
And that sort of
sets the background

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.190
to the story where the
technological side of the court

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.650
is kind of at loggerheads
with the mystical side

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:16.710
of the forest.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.770
And that relationship
is kind of exemplified

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.720
with the main characters.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.300
The first character is Annie.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.820
She comes to the court at
the beginning of the story.

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:31.490
She's the one who we see most
of the story through her eyes.

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.870
And she arrived at the court
just after losing her mother

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.262
and her father disappears.

00:06:37.262 --> 00:06:38.720
And she's not
particularly bothered

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.261
by all the strange
stuff that happens

00:06:40.261 --> 00:06:42.950
in the court-- all the monsters
and the scary stuff that

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:44.150
happens.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:45.780
And it turns out as
the story goes on

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:50.450
that she starts to foster
supernatural powers herself.

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:53.000
And on the other
hand, her friend Kat,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.167
she lived her whole
life in the court.

00:06:56.167 --> 00:06:58.000
But she's completely
bewildered by the stuff

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.208
that Annie introduces her to.

00:06:59.208 --> 00:07:01.310
She's very mechanically minded.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.890
She's an amateur roboticist.

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:08.210
She likes regular kid
stuff like comics and TV,

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.670
video games, that kind
of thing, and robots.

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:12.740
And so in these two
characters, they're

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.160
very opposite to each other just
like the court and the forest.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:21.330
But in their relationship, their
oppositeness is complementary.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.330
And it's the differences
between the two of them

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:24.890
that draws them
together and allows

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:28.600
them to be much closer
friends, and allows

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.250
them to work together in ways
that alone, neither one of them

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:35.880
would have been able
to do on their own.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:39.410
So in this story, you have
plenty of other relationships

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:44.180
and characters like lonely
ghosts, strange girls

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.910
who can distort reality.

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:50.000
You've got shadows and robots
who turn out to be friends.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.720
You have classmates with
their hidden romances.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.640
And a large part of
the story, I wanted

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.500
there to be a
feeling of the fact

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.110
that the teachers and the
parents of the children

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.720
were also fully
fleshed out characters.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.070
They have their own backgrounds.

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:06.140
This is a photo of a
lot of their parents

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.880
when they're younger
in the story.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.390
And I wanted them to be not
just parental figures and not

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:11.390
just teacher characters.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:14.210
I wanted them to feel like
fully-rounded elements

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:15.440
of the story themselves.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.655
And you also get this guy.

00:08:16.655 --> 00:08:20.270
This is Coyote, the trickster
god who lives in the forest.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:23.722
And he causes a lot of
trouble for the court

00:08:23.722 --> 00:08:24.680
and the main character.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.780
And he's basically a jerk.

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:31.268
But he's not the one
I wanted to focus on.

00:08:31.268 --> 00:08:32.809
The relationship I
wanted to focus on

00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:36.770
is Annie and one of Coyote's
minions, I guess, Ysengrin,

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:38.929
this wolf guy here.

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:41.210
So this is kind
of an illustration

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:44.660
of the sort of thing
you'd see in the story.

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:47.330
Like I said before, just a
very focused look at an arc

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:50.720
that I particularly enjoyed and
I wanted to explore in a way

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:54.150
that I found
interesting to myself.

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:56.360
And so when I do get
the chance to talk

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.490
to people about my
comic, I like to ask

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:03.410
people who their favorite
is just to get some feedback

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:05.600
and see what I'm doing
right, when I'm doing wrong.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.634
And in stories, not a lot of
people like the main character.

00:09:09.634 --> 00:09:12.050
Not because they're bad, but
because the main character is

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:14.640
usually the viewer stand in--

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.360
the every man that you can
identify yourself with.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.594
So a lot of people tend
to pick the more visually

00:09:21.594 --> 00:09:23.510
striking characters and
more interesting ones.

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:26.210
But personally, I really enjoy
the main characters in stories.

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:28.520
So I wanted the main
character of my story

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.560
to also be personally
interesting to myself.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.520
So even though I'm very
interested in the two

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:37.850
main characters, my
personal favorite is Annie.

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:41.300
And she kind of has to be,
because she's the character

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:42.620
that I write the most.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:44.600
And I have to know
all about her.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.790
And she has to be
personally interesting to me

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:48.350
to continue writing her.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:52.550
And I enjoy revealing parts of
her personality to the readers

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:53.600
as the story goes on.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:58.460
And so when she's
first introduced,

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.410
she is very cold and stoic.

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:03.230
And she has trouble
talking to people.

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:05.650
And this is because of
her past in the hospital

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:07.767
where she grew up.

00:10:07.767 --> 00:10:09.350
But after her mom
died in the hospital

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:11.720
and she came to
the court, she just

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.900
seemed very not able to
interact with anyone.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:17.894
And she's very solitary and
not really scared by anything.

00:10:17.894 --> 00:10:19.310
And this is due
to the experiences

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:22.490
she's had in the hospital.

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:26.090
And I wanted her to be not
just a reactive character

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:28.429
who is bewildered and
amazed by the stuff that

00:10:28.429 --> 00:10:29.220
happens around her.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:32.960
I wanted her to be very active
in the plot of the story.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:37.520
And sometimes the bad decisions
she makes and her experience

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:41.357
she had really drives
the plot forward,

00:10:41.357 --> 00:10:43.190
because she does make
a lot of bad decisions

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:44.970
throughout the
course of the story.

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:48.020
And the other guy
is this, Ysengrin,

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:51.320
When he's first introduced,
, he is a brute.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.510
He is a minion to
the god, Coyote,

00:10:53.510 --> 00:11:00.080
who is tough to compete with in
terms of flair and excitement.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.080
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:02.830
TOM SIDDELL: Yeah.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.150
So when you look at Ysengrin,
he is just basically

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:09.770
a wolf's head-- an
angry wolf's head--

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:13.640
on top of a weird tree body that
allows him to walk really tall

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.380
and tower above everyone.

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.770
And he seems very angry
and out of control.

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:18.770
And he seems very proud.

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:21.050
But as the story
continues, you find out

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:23.750
that the pride that he
holds is not for himself.

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:28.660
It's for Coyote that he
is completely devoted to.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:30.710
And he's very
dismissive of Annie.

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:32.450
He doesn't like humans
at all, let alone

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:35.180
having to deal with a young girl
that he's like sort of thrust

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:38.630
into this partnership
with against his will.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:43.490
And so at this point, I
wanted to talk about the first

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:48.380
of two little arcs in the
story that kind of exemplifies

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:50.340
their relationship
and how that changes.

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:55.610
So this first part, Ysengrin,
is fishing alone in the forest.

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:59.660
He's using his strange tree
root body to spear fish.

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:04.400
And we see him shed his body
to come and eat the fish.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.710
And we see that underneath
this strange exterior,

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:11.180
he's an emaciated,
very frail looking

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.650
wolf that can barely stand up.

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:16.010
And this is something
we've not seen

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:17.140
at this point in the story.

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:20.230
And he can barely
stand to eat this fish.

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:22.490
And it's kind of a
pathetic scene really.

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:24.470
It's very private
and he's alone.

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:28.230
Unfortunately for him, Coyote
has brought Annie along.

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:31.130
And they're watching
him from the bushes and

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:33.710
because Coyote is who
he is, pushes Annie out

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:38.240
in front of him, which
completely incenses Ysengrin.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.336
He's very angry to have been
found in this vulnerable state.

00:12:42.336 --> 00:12:43.710
And Annie has no
idea what to do.

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:45.680
She makes a very
poor decision here

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.240
where she tries to
help him up, which

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:50.690
is the exact opposite
thing that you should do.

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:55.080
So he gets her to back off as
he slinks to his tree body.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.170
And he gets to beef
himself back up again,

00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:00.140
and be strong, and then
face off against her.

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.810
And of course, Annie's
very scared here.

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:04.756
But she is standing her ground.

00:13:04.756 --> 00:13:07.670
And just before anything else
can get any further, old Coyote

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:09.680
comes along and
diffuses the situation,

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:12.605
and then takes Annie off
on a mystical journey,

00:13:12.605 --> 00:13:14.600
a little interlude.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:18.170
And these pages are sort of what
you would find in the story.

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:19.614
But I've taken
all the words off,

00:13:19.614 --> 00:13:21.530
because it's not important
that you read along

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:22.790
what's going on here.

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:25.560
It's just that they've
gone off and gone

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:26.560
on this magical journey.

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.120
And if you're interested,
you can read more about it

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.580
at gunnerkrigg.com.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.130
But since that's
not the focus, I

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:37.880
want to go back to just after
that scene happens where

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.650
it's time for Annie to go home.

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:43.760
And Ysengrin is made to
carry her back on his arm.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.120
And while he does that, as
they're traveling back--

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:48.380
I left the words here--

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:51.410
she takes the opportunity
to try and apologize to him.

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:55.430
And he says to never apologize
for what is not your fault,

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:58.160
because as soon
as he saw Coyote,

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.650
he knew that Annie was
tricked into that situation.

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:02.900
So he doesn't hold any
malice towards her.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:05.330
And this is the first time
that Annie and the readers

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:08.390
see that he's not really
a hateful creature.

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:10.850
He was just put
in a bad situation

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:15.150
and he's not holding
it against Annie.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:21.220
And so later on in the story,
Annie gets some very bad news.

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:22.532
And she is distraught.

00:14:22.532 --> 00:14:24.240
And she actually runs
away from the court

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.870
in a fit of anger
and desperation.

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:28.880
And this is a new
side we're starting

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:33.230
to see of Annie, who at this
point has been very distant

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:34.010
and emotionless.

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:36.980
We see that she's actually very
filled with an anger inside her

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:39.620
that she has trouble
controlling, which

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:41.259
leads her to run away.

00:14:41.259 --> 00:14:43.050
And that's where the
scene comes from here.

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:45.080
She runs into the court
and instinctively runs

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:48.050
towards Ysengrin, somebody
she's had a you couldn't even

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:50.930
call it a professional
relationship with at best.

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:52.330
They tolerate each other.

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.576
Or at least he
tolerates her barely.

00:14:54.576 --> 00:14:57.200
But he runs into the forest and
he picks her up and carries her

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.711
into the forest.

00:14:58.711 --> 00:15:00.710
And he tells her that he
is disappointed in her,

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:02.360
because she is weak.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.184
And this makes her angry.

00:15:04.184 --> 00:15:06.350
But the truth is that she
is weak, because everybody

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:08.120
starts off as weak.

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:11.330
And the point that he's making
is she might feel weak now,

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:15.100
but what she's just gone through
has made her a bit stronger.

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:19.040
And all she can do is continue
to take these experiences

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.170
and make herself stronger.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:24.770
And then this allows her to
spend the summer in the forest.

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:27.530
And over the time, they're
able to get to come closer.

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:29.450
And the relationship
changes a bit.

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:30.890
She's a lot freer.

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:33.110
And she's a lot more
comfortable in herself.

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:35.600
And she realizes that
Ysengrin, despite

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:39.940
his outward appearances,
is not just an angry wolf.

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:42.920
And she takes the opportunity
to become closer to him.

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:48.350
So the second part I
wanted to illustrate

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:51.530
is after she's
returned to the court,

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:54.530
she is tasked with learning
about the inner workings

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:55.700
of the forest.

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.779
And so in this
scene here, Annie is

00:15:57.779 --> 00:15:59.570
learning about the
creatures of the forest.

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:02.960
Ysengrin wants to teach
her and help guide her.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.600
So they come to this very
dark area of the forest

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:06.850
that she's never been to.

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:09.834
And it's full of big,
horrible, scary creatures,

00:16:09.834 --> 00:16:10.750
kind of like Ysengrin.

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:12.170
They're very
aggressive and they're

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:13.220
very dismissive of Annie.

00:16:15.702 --> 00:16:17.160
These are inhabitants
of the forest

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.540
that Annie has not had
any experience with.

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:25.010
And because of their
nature, a fight breaks out.

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:28.040
And Annie can do nothing but
just roll out of the way.

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:32.850
And luckily for her, this is
Ysengrin's bread and butter.

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:35.270
So he gets to work
laying down the law,

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:37.940
because he is in charge of
these creatures essentially,

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.751
which is why he
brought her here.

00:16:39.751 --> 00:16:41.000
But Annie, she can do nothing.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.090
All she can do is sit back,
and watch, and be distraught.

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:46.610
And at this point, it's actually
Coyote who comes to her,

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:50.290
and pulls her aside in private,
and gives her some advice,

00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:52.670
because Annie doesn't know
what to do or how to help.

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:56.310
So Coyote says, well start
speaking their language.

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:58.670
And when she comes back
and sees that Ysengrin

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:02.300
is being overwhelmed, Annie does
what any sane person would do

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:04.304
and sets him on
fire, because one

00:17:04.304 --> 00:17:05.720
of the things we
learn about Annie

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:09.020
is that she can control this
fire that is inside her.

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:12.410
And she can decide what
it does and does not burn.

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:16.640
So she projects the fire
around Ysengrin to protect him.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.710
And she projects it
around herself as well.

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:20.270
And she stands her ground.

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:22.760
Even when the creatures
come up to her,

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:24.589
she doesn't attack them.

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:26.810
But she doesn't allow
herself to be attacked.

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:29.390
All she does is stand
there and make it clear

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:31.880
that if they get closer
to her, they will just

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:35.310
be harming themselves.

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:38.450
And so she makes this
display of strength.

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:40.010
She doesn't insult
the creatures.

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:43.310
She doesn't try to make
them feel small or stupid.

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:44.930
She just stands
her ground and even

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:51.110
lets them know that she's
there for diplomatic reasons.

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:54.220
If they need to talk to
her, then she's there.

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:57.110
And these creatures,
they are at least

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:59.840
smart enough to understand
that they can't really

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.010
mess with her.

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:04.130
And so in their world,
their understanding

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:06.390
lets them know that they
shouldn't mess with her.

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:08.130
So they slink away.

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:10.760
And after this,
Ysengrin is very happy.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.350
This is like the only time
you see him like this.

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:14.840
He's tossing her
up into the air.

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.210
He's calling her beautiful,
which people don't really

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:19.010
say to Annie at all.

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:21.650
It's not the kind of thing
you'd say shamelessly

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:22.580
like Ysengrin would.

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:23.690
But he's a wolf.

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:25.100
It doesn't matter to him.

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.670
He's just ecstatic at the
strength that she showed

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:33.020
and how she comported herself.

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:36.560
And so after that,
the two of them

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.850
have gone through
an ordeal together,

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:42.840
not just in this particular
instance, but in their lives.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.980
They both had a very tough
life, very solitary lives.

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:49.440
And they find a unique
closeness in each other

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:53.290
that they don't find with their
other friends and compatriots

00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:55.100
that they might interact with.

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:58.670
Annie learns that the anger
she might have is not in itself

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:00.020
a bad thing.

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:02.720
And she learns to
control it is probably

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:06.600
what is the path to
maintaining her own feelings.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.304
And Ysengrin also,
he becomes a lot

00:19:08.304 --> 00:19:09.470
more comfortable with Annie.

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:12.020
You can see here that
he's shed his body.

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:16.250
And he is laying next to her
as she tends to his wounds.

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:20.240
And just him doing that is
a big compliment to Annie.

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.711
They don't acknowledge it or
he doesn't change his behavior

00:19:22.711 --> 00:19:23.210
at all.

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:28.732
But you can see
that compared to how

00:19:28.732 --> 00:19:30.440
they were at the
beginning, just the fact

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:32.540
that they are together
like this shows

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:35.540
that their relationship
has changed a lot.

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:37.280
And so their
relationship continues

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:40.469
to evolve throughout the story.

00:19:40.469 --> 00:19:42.260
More stuff happens in
the comic, but that's

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:44.627
where this illustration ends.

00:19:44.627 --> 00:19:46.460
And they continue to
change, because there's

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:49.640
a lot more to Annie that's
going on and evolves.

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:57.957
But the reason why I
wanted to explore this--

00:19:57.957 --> 00:20:00.290
why I wrote it and why I
wanted to talk about it today--

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:04.310
is because it's the
sort of relationship

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:09.560
that I feel I don't see very
often in a lot of pop culture.

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:14.100
I think there are a couple of
messages in their relationship

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.910
that I think runs counter
to a lot of popular messages

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:18.380
you see in stories.

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:21.020
And those messages are one,
you should let your emotions

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:22.430
lead your decisions.

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:24.590
And two, accept anger.

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:26.660
Don't let anger
decide your decisions.

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:29.360
In fact, anything that could be
classed as a negative emotion,

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.901
you should either ignore or you
should fix it, because you're

00:20:31.901 --> 00:20:33.200
broken in some way.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.440
And I didn't want to make
that sort of comment.

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.490
It might be true in
some circumstances.

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:42.200
But here I wanted to show
that two characters can

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.970
have a close
relationship that is not

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:45.500
particularly traditional.

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:46.830
Their emotions are strong.

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:48.630
And they're strong
for each other.

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:51.980
But they don't rule
their relationship.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:55.310
Ysengrin himself, he advocates
control and management.

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:58.760
And he doesn't show a lot of
these outward emotions, which

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:02.390
I feel that is often shown as
a very negative personality

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:04.897
trait.

00:21:04.897 --> 00:21:06.980
But in this instance, Annie
doesn't try and change

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:07.850
that in him.

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:11.790
She actually comes to understand
that that is how he is.

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:13.790
And she has a reverence
for him that she doesn't

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:16.500
have for a lot of
the other characters,

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:20.870
because they can sit
together in silence

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:25.817
and barely talk for a long
time and be very close.

00:21:25.817 --> 00:21:28.400
And it's very different to the
sort of touchy feely friendship

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.400
she has with her other friends
like the main character, Kat,

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:36.500
the very regular relationship
that two kids might have.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:39.650
But here I wanted to
show that not expressing

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:42.200
these emotions, as I
said, was not particularly

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.030
a negative thing,
because sometimes it's

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:46.430
OK if you choose not
to show your emotions.

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:48.740
Or if you feel that
you can't show them,

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:53.780
that's also fine, because I
felt that an emotion is not

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:55.860
purely positive or negative.

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:58.890
For example, like happiness--
a pretty positive emotion.

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:01.280
But what if it's happiness
for someone's murder?

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.530
You know, that's
not very positive.

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:06.720
Or let's say greed or
jealousy sounds bad.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.950
But what if desire forces
you to work harder and buy

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:11.390
that car that you want.

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:12.980
You know, that's helped you out.

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:15.950
Or hate, for example,
seems pretty bad.

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:17.537
But what if you
hate your wallpaper?

00:22:17.537 --> 00:22:18.620
You change your wallpaper.

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:20.750
What if you hate your job?

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:23.870
If you leave that hate to
fester, it will go bad.

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:26.600
If you use that hate
or dislike to motivate

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:30.050
you to do something else, does
that mean that it is now good?

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:33.420
In my opinion, an emotion is
just a thing that happens.

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:35.390
And it's what you do
with them that decides

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:37.440
whether they're good or bad.

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.220
And so this is why
Ysengrin promotes

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:45.170
taking an emotion like pain
or the painful experience

00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:48.012
that you might have had, and
solidify it inside yourself.

00:22:48.012 --> 00:22:49.970
And use that as part of
the foundation on which

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:52.220
to build your character.

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:54.840
And he also advocates for
keeping these emotions

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:55.340
in check.

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:56.990
And for someone
like Annie, who is

00:22:56.990 --> 00:23:00.020
liable to literally
spark off at any time,

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:02.540
it's very useful for her.

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:04.610
And it's the sort
of guidance that she

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:07.520
doesn't get from other
people who don't quite

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:08.450
understand who she is.

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:14.600
And with Ysengrin, if you
were to look at him in person,

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:20.180
all you would see is a big,
angry wolf guy on a tree.

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:22.220
And that's probably
what he wants to show.

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:24.410
But it takes someone to
actually care for him

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:27.000
and understand him that he
is something more than that.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.670
And he's just made the decision
to keep that at arm's length

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:32.900
and keep other people that he
has no time for if he decides

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:34.980
he keeps them at arm's length.

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:36.770
So when he does show
a flair of emotion,

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:38.750
it's a lot more
powerful to whoever's

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:40.910
there on the receiving
end as long as it's not

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:43.340
causing any damage, I guess.

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.650
And Annie realizes that
she is the same way.

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:50.180
When she joined the court, the
reason for her stoic appearance

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:52.700
is basically the same thing
that Ysengrin has done.

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:55.340
She finds it hard to deal
with the emotions that

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:57.890
are inside her, not just
because of losing her mom,

00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:59.840
or being transferred
to a new school,

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:03.410
or coming to terms with
these powers inside her.

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:06.020
She's just blocked
them off and tried

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:10.310
to ignore them completely,
which is why she does lead

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:14.000
to making some poor decisions.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.350
And the two of them have had
tough times in their life.

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:20.690
And because of this, if you
were to try and be overly

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:23.540
affectionate with a
creature like Ysengrin,

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:26.030
you would push him away.

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:28.040
And similarly with
Annie, if Ysengrin

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:32.330
was to try and deal with
her with a light touch

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:35.200
or with kid gloves, she
would lose respect for him.

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:38.402
And I think it's this
that draws them together.

00:24:38.402 --> 00:24:39.860
And that's not to
say that Ysengrin

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:41.270
is right about everything.

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:43.040
In the story, a lot
of the characters

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:46.232
question his advice
and his sanity.

00:24:46.232 --> 00:24:47.690
And Annie does get
a lot of support

00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:50.304
from the other characters too.

00:24:50.304 --> 00:24:52.220
But it's very different
to the kind of support

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:56.960
that she gets from Ysengrin.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:00.620
So Ysengrin's advice is
really from his point of view,

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:04.324
from his experiences.

00:25:04.324 --> 00:25:05.990
And when I was writing
these characters,

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:09.860
I like to sort of put
myself in their shoes

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:13.250
and figure out how they would
respond to certain situations.

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:15.380
And I think any
decent writer would

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:17.420
be able to write
characters that are

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:19.026
very different to themselves.

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:22.460
But in this case--

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:24.240
in fact, throughout
a lot of the story--

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:27.770
I find that a lot of the
scenes and scenarios that I'm

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:30.585
writing and exploring
are parts of myself

00:25:30.585 --> 00:25:33.650
that I wanted to explore and
get straight in the story.

00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:35.190
In fact, throughout
the whole story,

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:40.790
there's certain elements
of my life like places

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:42.890
where I used to go to
school, hints of teachers

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:45.260
that I used to like
back in school, friends

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:48.410
that I don't see anymore,
stuff that's personal to me

00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:50.120
that only I would notice.

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:52.370
And I think the readers
appreciate that,

00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:55.820
because they feel that
it's a lot more genuine.

00:25:55.820 --> 00:26:02.180
And what this means is that
I hear a lot of good feedback

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:05.000
from the readers, because
they start to empathize

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.529
with a lot of the situations.

00:26:06.529 --> 00:26:08.820
And they realize that I'm
kind of doing the same thing.

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:12.500
I'm exploring parts of myself.

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:14.780
And I think this works,
because people like

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:17.727
to see themselves in stories.

00:26:17.727 --> 00:26:20.060
It lets them know that they're
not the only person going

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:21.226
through a certain situation.

00:26:21.226 --> 00:26:23.300
It's easy to assume
that as a person,

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:25.220
you're the center
of your own universe

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:27.385
and everything else
is outward from that.

00:26:27.385 --> 00:26:28.760
Everything else
is just something

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.680
that you are experiencing
for the first time.

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:33.620
And it's easy to assume that
you're the first person ever

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:36.490
in history to feel an emotion.

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:39.660
And I think people gravitate
toward stories that show them

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:42.920
that they're not alone
in that sort of thing,

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:45.440
because in reality, nobody
knows what they're doing.

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.940
And we sort of
look for people who

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:48.660
say that they know
what they're doing.

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:51.860
They look for situations
that they can empathize with,

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:52.490
because--

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:53.990
I don't know-- I
guess it just makes

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:56.960
you feel a bit more
understood even if you're just

00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:00.410
passively reading something.

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:04.750
So I think this is an
underlying, common thread

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:05.680
throughout everyone.

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:08.560
Personally, I'm not a
pink-haired fire girl.

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.590
And I'm not an emaciated
talking wolf that

00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:14.320
uses a magical tree as a body.

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:17.060
But I can still empathize
with these characters.

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:20.140
And I think a
well-written character,

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:23.110
people can empathize with
despite looking nothing

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:26.650
like them or having very
similar experiences.

00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:29.920
A lot of the times, just
involving similar feelings

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:32.440
that somebody might have
experienced in their life

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:36.700
is enough to draw a reader
into enjoying a character.

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:39.570
And that is what a lot
of the story is about.

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:42.640
And there's a lot of different
parts of me in the story.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.440
But I try and take
those elements

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:48.310
and make them interesting
in their own right

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:51.400
whether I create a character
out of a certain experience

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:55.060
or a particular facet
of my own personality.

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:57.250
I try and make it
interesting rather than

00:27:57.250 --> 00:28:01.750
make it into a lecture,
which is what this is.

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:04.160
But people seem to like it.

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.160
And from those small
beginnings where

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:09.040
I decided to work on the
comic in my own spare time,

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:12.259
it's updated three times a week.

00:28:12.259 --> 00:28:13.300
I've had lots of support.

00:28:15.742 --> 00:28:17.450
It was actually picked
up by a publisher.

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:22.010
And the books are now available
in comic stores, bookstores.

00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:25.490
And the sixth one
is coming out soon.

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:28.510
And I've been lucky that
people have enjoyed it

00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:30.340
so much that they
wanted to support

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:31.720
me working on the story.

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:34.570
And they're interested in
seeing what happens next.

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:37.000
And it allows me to do
things like come and talk

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.010
here about it so
thanks for listening.

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:42.760
If you have any questions about
anything that you've heard

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:47.780
or anything related
to it, just speak now.

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:58.860
AUDIENCE: So reading
the comic, it's

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:02.670
very clear that you plan
at least certain things

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:04.460
in advance.

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:07.030
Like I'm thinking of
what's going on right now.

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:10.500
But even what you
showed here, the two

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:13.790
parts of that arc between
Annie and Ysengrin,

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:15.687
there was like a year
or two between them.

00:29:15.687 --> 00:29:17.020
TOM SIDDELL: That's right, yeah.

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:20.155
AUDIENCE: So I was wondering,
how in detail do you plan--

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:24.310
Yeah.

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:25.170
TOM SIDDELL: In
detail, plan the comic.

00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:25.670
Yeah.

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:28.230
AUDIENCE: How far
ahead, and how deep?

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:28.980
TOM SIDDELL: Yeah.

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:31.230
A lot of people are interested
in knowing whether or not

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:32.938
I know actually where
this story is going

00:29:32.938 --> 00:29:35.010
or if I'm just making it up.

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:37.499
The answer is that I know
exactly how the story will end.

00:29:37.499 --> 00:29:39.540
I know what will happen
to each of the characters

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:40.124
along the way.

00:29:40.124 --> 00:29:41.790
But I couldn't tell
you how long it will

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:43.080
take to get to those points.

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:45.000
I have sort of a
roadmap of points

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.580
that I need to hit along
the way that will ultimately

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:48.630
lead to the ending.

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:51.090
So the stuff with Annie's
development and the stuff

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:53.160
with Ysengrin, that
was planned basically

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.680
when I introduced
those characters.

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:58.890
But as for how soon I
get to developing those,

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:00.060
it's kind of malleable.

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:02.070
You know, if I find
something I'm interested in,

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:03.780
as long as it
pertains to the plot,

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:06.120
I might take a detour
and search for that.

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:08.310
But then I'll always
come back to the route

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:10.080
that I've started,
because I kind of know

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:13.290
what I need to hit along the way
for the character developments

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:14.610
to actually make sense.

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:20.880
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about the development

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.580
of relationships in
the story, because I

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:26.600
feel like over the years,
you've been writing it

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:29.280
like the development, especially
like platonic relationships,

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:30.390
feels really natural.

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:33.300
And I was wondering if
you sort of plan out

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:36.310
what friendships you want
and sort of tweak it to fit

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:38.960
or if you just let the
characters sort of organically

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:42.080
see who they become friends,
like how that works.

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:43.860
TOM SIDDELL: Yeah.

00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:45.971
when it comes to the
plot-specific stuff,

00:30:45.971 --> 00:30:47.970
I need to make sure there
are certain characters

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:50.220
are in certain
positions, whether it's

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:53.610
frame-of-mind or
physically in the story.

00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:55.350
So I keep track of those.

00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:57.660
But sometimes,
characters that I'll

00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:00.910
introduce that I never
intended to be friends end up

00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:04.230
do being friends.

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:07.200
Like for example, there's a
relationship between Kat--

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.560
secondary main character--
and a girl called Zimmy.

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:12.060
And for whatever reason, they've
sort of disliked each other

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:12.780
from the start.

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:14.780
And there's a very
specific reason for that

00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:18.360
that I sort of wanted to
introduce at the beginning.

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:22.376
But then on the other
hand, Red, the fairy,

00:31:22.376 --> 00:31:24.000
I knew that she was
going to come back.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.920
But I wasn't sure quite
how their relationship

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:28.680
would evolve and change.

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.510
And so when a character
like that, if I

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:34.860
know that I have an amount of
leeway to change relationships,

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:37.860
that isn't going to affect the
overall plot-- or even better,

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:39.110
lend itself to the plot.

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:40.860
Then I'll take the
time to indulge in that

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:42.276
and see what ideas
come from that.

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:49.631
AUDIENCE: Your art
style have significantly

00:31:49.631 --> 00:31:50.880
improved throughout the years.

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:51.838
TOM SIDDELL: I hope so.

00:31:51.838 --> 00:31:52.680
Yeah.

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:55.290
AUDIENCE: I liked it from the
start, but it changed a lot.

00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:58.532
TOM SIDDELL: That
makes one of us.

00:31:58.532 --> 00:32:00.990
AUDIENCE: So is it just from
practicing three times a week?

00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:04.370
Or are you actively taking
courses, learning stuff online,

00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:05.260
having references?

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:08.850
TOM SIDDELL: I was
never formally taught.

00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:12.000
So I think it is literally
just spending my own time.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.760
And I think working on it
three times a week, as you say,

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:18.600
is a big reason why the style
that I chose at the beginning

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:21.262
became anything at all.

00:32:21.262 --> 00:32:22.720
When I was working
a full time job,

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:25.011
I literally just had part of
the weekend to work on it.

00:32:25.011 --> 00:32:27.270
And it took the entire
weekend to get three pages up.

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:32.010
So any practice that I was
doing in visual storytelling,

00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:35.100
writing comics, in
fact, or just using

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.230
the nuts and bolts of
Photoshop and figuring out

00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:40.050
how to illustrate, that
was all done in the comic.

00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:43.320
And so I use that
as an excuse for why

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.780
things look a little bit
shaky at the beginning.

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:48.480
I was hoping that things would
look better as they continued.

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:50.563
And I still feel that I
have a lot of improvement.

00:32:50.563 --> 00:32:53.520
But I can also
mask that by saying

00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:55.830
that I intended them to grow
up and look different too.

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:58.270
So I can hide behind
that a little bit.

00:32:58.270 --> 00:32:58.770
But, yeah.

00:32:58.770 --> 00:33:00.840
It's literally just
working on it every week.

00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:05.830
AUDIENCE: Were there
particular manga titles

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:09.450
that you felt really inspired
you and you found yourself

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:12.940
weaving in, or somehow
the elements would

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:16.440
get worked into your own work?

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:19.650
TOM SIDDELL: I can
say, absolutely yes.

00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:21.900
I think I would
even be hard pressed

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:26.870
to point out specifically
where I've woven in details.

00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:30.030
But yeah.

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:31.470
The first comic
that I really got

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:33.720
into that showed me that
comics should be more

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:36.420
than either for adults or kids
was actually "Dragonball."

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:40.110
I read it in Spanish,
because for whatever reason,

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:44.517
they were imported into Europe
a lot sooner than in the UK.

00:33:44.517 --> 00:33:46.350
And I had no idea they
were Japanese comics.

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:48.942
I thought they were
Spanish comics.

00:33:48.942 --> 00:33:51.150
And they looked like nothing
else that I was reading.

00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:52.233
They were black and white.

00:33:52.233 --> 00:33:54.930
But they still looked amazing.

00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:57.540
And I really love black
and white art in comics.

00:33:57.540 --> 00:33:59.220
And they were crass as well.

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:03.960
Early "Dragonball" is really
crass, lots of poop jokes.

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.540
But also it had this
evolution of character

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:08.329
that I really fell in love with.

00:34:08.329 --> 00:34:09.870
As you read the
story, the characters

00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:12.916
grew up, which is very
contrary to I guess

00:34:12.916 --> 00:34:14.040
a lot of comics in general.

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:16.980
But a lot of the
stories in the UK--

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:19.122
like the ones I mentioned,
"Beano" and "Dandy,"

00:34:19.122 --> 00:34:20.580
and even "2000
ID"-- the characters

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:23.489
are stuck in this
sort of time warp

00:34:23.489 --> 00:34:24.900
where they never get older.

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:26.969
And the world might
change around them,

00:34:26.969 --> 00:34:28.969
but it's always the
same characters.

00:34:28.969 --> 00:34:31.719
And I guess that's fine
if that's your story.

00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:35.260
But for me personally,
I found that development

00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:38.802
in a lot of the long
form Japanese comics,

00:34:38.802 --> 00:34:41.010
I think that was probably
my biggest single influence

00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:42.672
that I wanted to
maintain in this

00:34:42.672 --> 00:34:44.880
and have the characters age,
and grow up, and develop

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:45.884
as they go on.

00:34:45.884 --> 00:34:47.050
I'm sure there's a ton more.

00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:51.360
I bet there's characters
based on aspects that I

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:54.429
wanted to explore
and things like that.

00:34:54.429 --> 00:34:54.929
But yeah.

00:34:54.929 --> 00:34:57.054
I'd have to go through and
really think about that.

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:05.310
AUDIENCE: So kind of related
to the previous two questions,

00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:10.440
I'm wondering like when
you started, did you

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:13.910
have an idea of what sort of
art style you were aiming for?

00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:14.730
It's like, oh yeah.

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:20.043
This is like what
I want to do, but I

00:35:20.043 --> 00:35:21.390
have to like develop myself.

00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:22.905
And like I'll get
there eventually.

00:35:22.905 --> 00:35:24.280
And now you're
like, oh you know.

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:25.030
TOM SIDDELL: Yeah.

00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:29.550
No that's interesting, because
I didn't have a specific idea.

00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:32.130
The goal was kind
of utilitarian.

00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:35.160
It was more that I needed to
be able to get it done quickly

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:38.280
and effectively, which is why
the coloring for the characters

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:39.310
is very flat.

00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:42.450
The coloring in the backgrounds
can have a bit more depth.

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:44.950
And the characters are drawn
very simply at the beginning.

00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:48.645
And it was very different
to how I drew at the time,

00:35:48.645 --> 00:35:50.520
because I felt that I
needed a way of getting

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:53.360
the pages finished and then
moving on to the next one,

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:57.210
because I didn't want to fall
into the trap of laboring

00:35:57.210 --> 00:35:59.640
over a single page and
then never updating again.

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:03.730
So I knew that I had a
specific goal in mind.

00:36:03.730 --> 00:36:06.340
But I had no idea what
it is going to look like.

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:09.507
I'm fairly happy with
how it looks now.

00:36:09.507 --> 00:36:11.340
And there are some
differences in my artwork

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:13.210
that I want to
make and expand on.

00:36:13.210 --> 00:36:15.540
And I'm hoping that
continues, because I think

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:17.970
if I feel that I've
improved as much as I could,

00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:20.454
then that's when I
start to stagnate.

00:36:20.454 --> 00:36:22.620
So no, I had no idea what
it was going to look like.

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:24.976
But I did have just
the sort of groundwork

00:36:24.976 --> 00:36:26.474
at the beginning to go off.

00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:31.360
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:33.770
I've been reading the
comic since high school.

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:37.960
And I wanted to ask
about Kat and Paz,

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:40.027
who I really love
that relationship.

00:36:40.027 --> 00:36:41.860
It like really means a
lot to me and a bunch

00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:44.560
of like my other
queer women friends.

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.620
And I wanted to ask like
how early you started

00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:49.450
like thinking about
developing that relationship

00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:51.200
and getting those two
characters together.

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:53.200
Like was it like with the
platonic relationships

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.480
where it's kind of like intended
from the start to put them

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:56.980
in the same place
at the same time,

00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:58.892
or if it like happened later on?

00:36:58.892 --> 00:37:00.850
TOM SIDDELL: It happened
a bit more organically

00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:01.891
than some of the stories.

00:37:01.891 --> 00:37:04.900
But I knew that
with Kat and Annie,

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:10.554
I wanted to introduce the
relationship where you know,

00:37:10.554 --> 00:37:12.970
to be frank about it, I wanted
to introduce a relationship

00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:16.390
where Kat was attracted
to another girl.

00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:18.790
But it didn't cause a
rift in the relationship

00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:20.710
that she had with Annie.

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:25.450
It wasn't a situation where
they would stop being friends

00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:27.610
or that Annie would think
that for whatever reason

00:37:27.610 --> 00:37:30.320
they can't be friends anymore.

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:33.460
I wanted to show that their
platonic relationship can

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:37.330
be maintained while
Kat grows an attraction

00:37:37.330 --> 00:37:38.500
with another classmate.

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:42.130
And the choice to
use Paz as the girl

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:44.834
that Kat eventually
becomes attracted to,

00:37:44.834 --> 00:37:46.000
that was a bit more organic.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:52.370
I had the ideas of their
interactions at first in mind.

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:54.670
But then when I wrote
some of the scenes,

00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:57.140
I thought that they had a
really good chemistry together.

00:37:57.140 --> 00:38:02.950
And so I knew that she was going
to get together with someone

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:04.690
and it was very
likely to be Paz.

00:38:04.690 --> 00:38:07.180
And in the end, I just chose
that it was going to be her.

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:10.990
And so I focused on
their relationship

00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:14.590
and showed how it was actually a
good opportunity for me to make

00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:16.432
Paz into a more
rounded character,

00:38:16.432 --> 00:38:17.890
because right at
the beginning, she

00:38:17.890 --> 00:38:20.450
was just a background
character like a lot of them.

00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:24.590
And in fact, if you were
to look at the first

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:28.250
the first two chapters are
me sort of finding my ground.

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:30.490
That's why they're very
different to chapters

00:38:30.490 --> 00:38:32.680
you might find later on.

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:35.560
I used the first two
chapters to get a feel

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:37.730
for working on comics.

00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:39.670
Whereas I knew where
the story was headed,

00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:42.520
I didn't quite know
what the tone was.

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:45.220
It was actually going to be
more like a murder mystery

00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:46.426
sort of story.

00:38:46.426 --> 00:38:47.800
And I realized
that by the time I

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:49.150
finished the first two
chapters that that's

00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:50.316
not the theme that I wanted.

00:38:50.316 --> 00:38:54.160
So during that time when I drew
various background characters,

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:55.480
Paz was one of them.

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:58.560
And I liked her enough to want
to develop her character more.

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:02.650
And I think because of
the format of the story,

00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:04.360
I had the freedom to do that.

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:05.210
So yeah.

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:06.400
I think I made a
good choice for Paz,

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.941
because she's one
of my favorite ones

00:39:07.941 --> 00:39:09.730
that I wanted to
expand a bit more on.

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:16.260
AUDIENCE: That's
another question.

00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:21.210
So the court is highly
technological and a somewhat

00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:23.490
secretive organization.

00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:24.240
TOM SIDDELL: Yeah.

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:30.270
AUDIENCE: So how much of
the current, very large

00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:34.170
technical corporations are
you kind of like drawing on?

00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:38.040
Or is this kind of more
of some other influences

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:39.930
I could also see?

00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:43.620
TOM SIDDELL: Well I guess
from the visual standpoint,

00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:46.590
the look of the court is
very much based on Birmingham

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:49.740
where I currently live and
where my family is from.

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:53.312
Birmingham, they call it
the Second City of the UK.

00:39:53.312 --> 00:39:55.020
But it's not actually
the second largest.

00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:56.880
It's just during
the World War II,

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.377
it was one of the
most important.

00:39:58.377 --> 00:40:00.210
It's where a lot of the
Spitfires were made.

00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:05.370
And the black country is where
a lot of the factories were.

00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:07.110
And all those factories
are still there,

00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:08.340
but no one uses them anymore.

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:11.160
Nobody uses coal refineries.

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:14.790
And so they're just sort of
left as dilapidated factories

00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:16.040
around.

00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:20.160
It's being changed now, but
just like any inner city,

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:21.900
it gets developed.

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:24.690
But I wanted to make a lot
of the interior of the court

00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:26.340
look a lot like
that just because I

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:29.300
thought it was a nice backdrop
to have everything there.

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:32.400
There's the sense of there
is an era of technology

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:36.070
in the area in Birmingham--
and where the girls are,

00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:38.190
they're the main characters--
that has moved on.

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:39.540
And it's empty now.

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:42.210
It's technology that is
old and it's falling apart.

00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:44.190
And that's currently
where the characters are.

00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:47.370
So it wasn't a
specific inspiration

00:40:47.370 --> 00:40:49.380
from particular companies.

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:51.930
But it was that feeling
of technological progress

00:40:51.930 --> 00:40:57.234
has moved on and what was high
technology has now moved on.

00:40:57.234 --> 00:40:59.900
And I felt that was just sort of
an interesting backdrop for it.

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:06.270
AUDIENCE: So I like
that you wanted

00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:09.877
to point out one of these
important relationships

00:41:09.877 --> 00:41:10.710
that you're writing.

00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:12.030
And I'm curious what other--

00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:14.680
there are a lot of great iconic
duos throughout this comic.

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:16.260
And I'm curious
which other one you

00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:18.218
like writing the most
besides the other one you

00:41:18.218 --> 00:41:22.250
talked about today and,
of course, Annie and Kat.

00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:24.180
TOM SIDDELL: One that
I found interesting

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:27.299
and I had a good
time working on was--

00:41:27.299 --> 00:41:29.340
spoiler alert, I guess--
is a relationship that's

00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:30.840
actually come to a close.

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:33.330
It was Mort's
introduction to the story.

00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:36.280
Mort is- there he is
on the top right--

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:38.400
he's a little ghost boy.

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:40.860
And as soon as he was
introduced into the story,

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:43.290
I knew how he would
exit the story,

00:41:43.290 --> 00:41:46.020
because he had a
very, very closed arc.

00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:50.620
And he was like one of the
first characters introduced

00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:53.080
into the story really early on.

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:55.740
And when he was
able to leave, it

00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:57.540
was like finally, I
can show everybody

00:41:57.540 --> 00:42:00.930
what I had in mind for
this boy and give him

00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:02.550
the final send off.

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:06.156
And I didn't dwell
on it, but I did

00:42:06.156 --> 00:42:07.530
want to sort of
touch on the fact

00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:10.860
that he's a ghost that
hangs around in the court,

00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:12.690
but he'll never get older.

00:42:12.690 --> 00:42:16.500
And he knew that Annie and
Kat were going to grow up.

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:20.010
And so he used that opportunity,
as well, to exit the comic

00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:23.220
or, I guess, the world.

00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:27.510
And I really enjoyed writing
him and drawing especially

00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:30.960
his final chapter, where
I get to show his past

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:34.042
and show in no uncertain terms
how he came to be where he is.

00:42:34.042 --> 00:42:35.500
And there's a sense
of satisfaction

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:38.910
in wrapping up a long
running thread like that.

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:44.820
But as for other
characters, I like Jones.

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:48.480
She's-- I guess she's
not up there-- but Jones,

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:52.920
she has a really strange
relationship with Eglamore that

00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:55.590
I've not really gone into
very much yet and I'm looking

00:42:55.590 --> 00:42:57.390
forward to doing that.

00:42:57.390 --> 00:43:00.210
There's a lot of relationships
that I really look forward

00:43:00.210 --> 00:43:05.430
to exploring like
Annie's dad and her mom,

00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:09.900
sharing what happened there
and showing how things

00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:11.400
have ended up where they are.

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:13.760
And Jones I like in
particular, because she's

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.490
a common thread throughout
a lot of those stories.

00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:19.552
And I couldn't pick
a particular favorite

00:43:19.552 --> 00:43:21.510
just because they have
to be interesting to me.

00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:23.310
Otherwise I wouldn't have
them in there at all.

00:43:23.310 --> 00:43:24.630
Zimmy and Gamma, for example.

00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:26.569
I love writing those two.

00:43:26.569 --> 00:43:28.110
And I want to write
comics about them

00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:30.864
separate from the main story.

00:43:30.864 --> 00:43:33.030
But in the meantime, they're
in and out of the comic

00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:34.552
when the plot needs them there.

00:43:34.552 --> 00:43:36.385
AUDIENCE: Is there a
large Polish population

00:43:36.385 --> 00:43:37.515
in Birmingham?

00:43:37.515 --> 00:43:38.640
TOM SIDDELL: Yes, there is.

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:42.150
That was one of the inspirations
for writing Gamma as someone

00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:43.500
who can only speak Polish.

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:45.510
But I guess they
gravitated there

00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:47.010
after-- again,
after World War II,

00:43:47.010 --> 00:43:48.343
there was a shortage of workers.

00:43:48.343 --> 00:43:52.290
So there was a lot of
European migrants looking

00:43:52.290 --> 00:43:56.200
for work from Poland and
I guess from Jamaica too.

00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:57.600
So there's a large--

00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:02.400
and middle European population
just there that I thought

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:03.534
was interesting.

00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:07.870
Any other questions?

00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:09.280
AUDIENCE: I've got one.

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:10.800
TOM SIDDELL: Yeah, sure.

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:17.760
AUDIENCE: So I noticed in some
of the more recent comics,

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:24.150
there's been essentially
a moral debate happening

00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:27.270
in all of the reader comments.

00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:31.470
So they've been debating,
did this character

00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:35.490
make the right decisions with
the information that they had?

00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:42.570
And did they needlessly
endanger other characters?

00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:50.190
And one of the things that
happened immediately afterwards

00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:58.320
was kind of a quieter
patch of the comic where

00:44:58.320 --> 00:44:59.910
two characters
actually discussed

00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:03.480
the moral implications and the
decisions that they have made.

00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:08.220
So to what degree did
you sense that coming on?

00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:12.430
Or did you see what was
happening, the response you

00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:14.490
were getting from
readers, and feel

00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:19.470
that it was worth a response
in the comic itself?

00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:20.220
TOM SIDDELL: Yeah.

00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:22.620
Well the way that
I work on the comic

00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:24.720
is that I draw with
a large buffer.

00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:27.780
And this was part of what
I set up at the beginning

00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:30.940
to make sure I didn't
miss any updates.

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:33.720
And that buffer is roughly
two months worth of comics.

00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:35.560
So if I was to keel
over and die right now,

00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:37.170
you'd at least get
some more comics

00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:40.000
to read for a little while.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.400
But what that means is
that I don't generally

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:47.610
have the time to, if I
feel the reader reaction is

00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:50.935
strong enough that I need
to address it in the comic,

00:45:50.935 --> 00:45:53.310
I literally just don't have
the time, because by the time

00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:55.230
people are reading
what's happening now,

00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:56.760
I've already drawn
two months ahead.

00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:58.176
So the stuff that
is happening now

00:45:58.176 --> 00:46:00.570
that some people
are speculating,

00:46:00.570 --> 00:46:02.750
well he's done this to
address our comments,

00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:05.220
turns out I actually
wrote the scenes

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:07.950
originally knowing that people
would have these questions.

00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:09.190
And now I'm addressing them.

00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:10.200
So I don't know.

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:13.500
Whether that makes me
seem smart or lucky,

00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:15.750
it just so happens that what
they're talking about now

00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:17.333
is the stuff that a
lot of the readers

00:46:17.333 --> 00:46:19.180
were discussing
amongst themselves.

00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:23.034
And so at least I can say
that I had the foresight

00:46:23.034 --> 00:46:25.200
to anticipate that people
would have some questions.

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:28.140
But this discussion
is what I wanted

00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:30.790
to have after this
particular sequence of events

00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:32.330
that you're talking about.

00:46:32.330 --> 00:46:34.160
So I guess I looked into it.

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:37.940
Anybody else?

00:46:42.584 --> 00:46:43.250
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:46:43.250 --> 00:46:47.000
Returning to the theme of like
the progression of the artwork,

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.420
I know that there are a
couple of webcomic artists

00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:55.700
who have eventually come back
and redrawn early panels.

00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:58.910
Given like the overarching
theme of like growth

00:46:58.910 --> 00:47:02.120
and the personal journey
focus of your talk,

00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:04.610
do you have a
philosophical disagreement

00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:06.260
with this practice?

00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:08.210
TOM SIDDELL: Oh no, not at all.

00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:11.540
If people want to do that,
then all the power to them.

00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:14.240
But it's something that
I am never going to do,

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:16.850
because I've seen
it happen before,

00:47:16.850 --> 00:47:18.980
but it's very easy
quagmire to get

00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:21.912
stuck in where you can
put your comic on hold

00:47:21.912 --> 00:47:23.495
and then go back and
start essentially

00:47:23.495 --> 00:47:26.139
redrawing it from the start.

00:47:26.139 --> 00:47:27.680
Some people have
the time to do that.

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:29.960
There is a lot of value
in that, especially I

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:34.874
think if you're doing a much
shorter, self-contained story.

00:47:34.874 --> 00:47:36.290
And if I was doing
that, maybe I'd

00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:38.120
want to go back and
redraw some elements.

00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:41.540
But for me, I can look back
at the beginning of the story

00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:44.599
and understand that that's
all I could do at the time

00:47:44.599 --> 00:47:46.640
and be glad that I've
progressed to a point where

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:47.598
it does look different.

00:47:47.598 --> 00:47:52.130
So I've made the active decision
to not go back and redraw those

00:47:52.130 --> 00:47:54.561
even though it's been
tempting sometimes.

00:47:54.561 --> 00:47:56.060
I mean there's been
one or two areas

00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:57.740
where I've had to
reformat the text,

00:47:57.740 --> 00:47:59.990
because it was too close to
the side of a word bubble.

00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:02.430
But that's about
the extent of it.

00:48:02.430 --> 00:48:02.930
Yeah.

00:48:02.930 --> 00:48:04.596
I didn't want to get
stuck in that trap.

00:48:10.410 --> 00:48:12.740
AUDIENCE: I came in late so
I might have missed this,

00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:14.270
but how do you draw them?

00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:15.852
And thanks for coming here.

00:48:15.852 --> 00:48:16.810
TOM SIDDELL: Thank you.

00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:17.560
How do I draw who?

00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:18.180
Sorry.

00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:19.930
AUDIENCE: Just how do
you draw the comics?

00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:21.184
Like what do you use for it?

00:48:21.184 --> 00:48:21.850
TOM SIDDELL: OK.

00:48:21.850 --> 00:48:22.500
Yeah.

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:23.660
I could spend ages
talking about this,

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:25.493
but I'll try and give
you the quick version.

00:48:25.493 --> 00:48:28.170
When I started, I drew
it on printer paper, just

00:48:28.170 --> 00:48:31.500
A4 printer paper with pencil.

00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:33.560
And then I used to
fine liners to ink it.

00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:35.030
And then I would scan it.

00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:37.370
After a while, I didn't
like that process

00:48:37.370 --> 00:48:38.970
so I switched to
what I'm doing now,

00:48:38.970 --> 00:48:40.620
which is currently all digital.

00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:43.410
It's the same exact
processes, but I just

00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:46.460
removed the step
of having to worry

00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:49.220
about erasing lines and
destroying my paper before I

00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:50.790
can scan it.

00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:52.340
So I draw it all.

00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:55.760
I sketch the pages according
to a script that I have.

00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:58.700
I draw them currently
in Photoshop.

00:48:58.700 --> 00:48:59.540
And then ink them.

00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:03.470
And I color them either
entirely in Photoshop

00:49:03.470 --> 00:49:05.930
or I use another program
called Corel Painter.

00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:08.210
I guess the ones that
are examples here

00:49:08.210 --> 00:49:10.190
that are in the story
themselves are colored

00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:11.810
in Photoshop with
some brush tools

00:49:11.810 --> 00:49:13.250
that I've developed myself.

00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:17.180
When I do illustrations--
let's see if I can find one--

00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:20.000
I do take it into a
different program that

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:25.850
handles colors and colors a bit
better like this one would have

00:49:25.850 --> 00:49:28.500
been done in Painter just
because it handles color

00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:31.200
a bit differently
for illustrations.

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:33.530
So yeah.

00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:36.320
It's not a very specialized
way of working on the comic.

00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:38.930
And again, it's because
I needed a simple way

00:49:38.930 --> 00:49:40.340
of getting it done.

00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:42.230
I think in the
future, I might be

00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:44.210
looking to move
away from Photoshop,

00:49:44.210 --> 00:49:46.510
but still maintain
a similar look.

00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:49.130
But that's just because
Photoshop is not

00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:53.150
really built for illustrators
and comic artists.

00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:56.960
It was very much a tool that I
had to maneuver into a position

00:49:56.960 --> 00:50:01.047
that I could get it
to do what I wanted.

00:50:01.047 --> 00:50:01.880
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:03.410
I think that's all
the time we have.

00:50:03.410 --> 00:50:04.368
TOM SIDDELL: OK, great.

00:50:04.368 --> 00:50:07.330
AUDIENCE: Let's thank
Tom for coming out.

00:50:07.330 --> 00:50:11.280
[APPLAUSE]
