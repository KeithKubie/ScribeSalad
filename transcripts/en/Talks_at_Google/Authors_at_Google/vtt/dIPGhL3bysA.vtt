00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.120
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm honored to
welcome back Chittra Banerjee

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.510
Divakaruni to Google.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:11.160
Her accomplishments as an
author are far-reaching.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.180
Her short story collection,
"Arranged Marriage," won an

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.420
American Book Award in 1995.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.130
And two novels, "The Mistress
of Spices" and "Sister of My

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.190
Heart," were adapted into
film recently as well.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.760
Her work's also been published
in over 50 magazines,

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.370
including "The Atlantic Monthly"
and "The New Yorker,"

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.730
and her writing has been
included in over 50

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.770
anthologies, including "Best
American Stories," "The

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.830
O'Henry Prize Stories," and
"The Pushcart Prize

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:48.240
Anthology." Her fan base is
global, with her work being

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.230
translated into 20 languages,
including Dutch, Hebrew,

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.410
Indonesian, and Japanese.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.650
And apart from being a
celebrated author, she is

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.480
Professor of Creative Writing at
the University of Houston.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.230
On a personal note, as a woman,
mother, daughter, and

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.110
friend with a strong interest
in the experience of the

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.210
Southeast Asian community,
I've been drawn

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.190
to Chittra's work.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.090
Her books have become
favorites.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.410
For me, her stories fully
immerse the reader in her

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.880
characters' journey, joys,
struggles, and triumphs.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.540
Be it rallying for success or
sharing in the pain of a

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.340
troubled experience, her style
brings the reader deep into

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.100
the moments.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.140
And at times, it feels like you
can see, taste, and hear

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.920
the sounds that are described
in the book.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.340
She's been hailed by Abraham
Verghese as a gifted

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.680
storyteller, and by "People"
magazine as a skilled

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.690
cartographer of the
heart, and I

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.080
completely +1 this sentiment.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.960
And I'm uberly excited to hear
experts from this latest work,

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.810
"Oleander Girl," and learned
recently over lunch that we

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.520
are very privileged to be the
first ones hearing this here

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.130
in Google, because this
is a pre-launch.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.300
It's actually the first place
she's reading here in

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.100
California, and it's being
officially launched tomorrow.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.420
So please join me in welcoming
Chittra Banerjee Divakaruni.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.560
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.680
CHITTRA BANERJEE DIVAKARUNI:
Thank you, Regina.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.130
Thank you for inviting
me back to Google.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.930
It is such a pleasure
to be here.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.690
It's always exciting
and wonderful.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.000
And I always say that if I were
a techie, this is where I

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.330
would want to work.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.940
So I'm in the happy position of
actually having two books

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.830
that are coming out
at the same time.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.730
I'll be talking about "Oleander
Girl," but I just

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.790
wanted to show everyone this
book, which is my first

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.710
children's picture book.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.360
And it's called "Grandma and
the Great Gourd." And it is

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.990
the retailing of a Bengali folk
tale my grandfather used

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.840
to tell me when I was little and
I was growing up in India.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.880
So it's very exciting for me to
share this book with other

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.590
people, people who speak English
and who might want to

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.020
share the culture with
their children.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.060
And this is "Oleander Girl." You
heard that it's just come

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.100
out, so it's an exciting time.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.010
It's kind of a scary time,
because you put your baby out

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.210
there in the world and you wait
to see what other people

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:28.880
are going to say.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.300
And interestingly, this
too is a family story.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.490
It is a story that talks about
a grandfather and a

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.050
granddaughter, among
other things.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.010
This is a book--

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.190
a novel about love, not just
romantic, although that is

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.580
there, but really, human love.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.920
And it's about difference.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.160
It's about how to do we live
in the world, which is a

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.060
multicultural world, an
increasingly global world?

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.380
How do we live there with people
who believe differently

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.740
about things, who have different
ideologies or ways

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.540
of life or religions?

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.590
How can we live in friendship
and in love?

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.840
This book is set in 2002, which,
as I'm sure you know,

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.560
was an important year for--

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.930
in many places of the world.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.540
In America, it was post-9/11.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.470
We were really getting into
understanding what were the

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.520
long-term effects of 9/11, not
just on the families who had

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.220
lost people, but on Americans
overall, and especially

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.800
brown-skinned Americans who
looked quote unquote

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.990
different, who looked quote
unquote dangerous.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.160
2002 is also the year of the
Gujarat riots in India,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.050
terrible Hindu Muslim riots,
the repercussions of which

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.800
went all across the country to
Kolkata, which is the city

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.390
where the book is set in India,
which is also my city

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.610
where I was born and
spent many years.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.040
Those are some of the things
that I tried to bring together

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.400
in "Oleander Girl." "Oleander
Girl" is also about the fast,

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.270
changing nature of
India itself.

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.535
Because in Kolkata, as I've
experienced it, and maybe some

00:05:25.535 --> 00:05:29.190
of you have experienced it in
other places, the old and the

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.890
new clash up against
each other.

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.320
India is changing so fast,
and yet it has

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.880
such a strong tradition.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.910
What happens when you push them
up against each other?

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.110
So this is the story of a
young woman from a very

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.680
traditional Indian family who
has been brought up by her

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.590
grandparents, and who falls in
love with a young man from a

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.200
very different kind of family.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.170
Her fiance Rajat comes
from a new India.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.420
Their family is new money.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.220
And what happens when you try to
put those families together

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.200
is part of what the story or
"Oleander Girl" is about.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.840
I'm going to read to you a
little bit from the beginning.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.830
The story begins the night
before Korobi--

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:15.950
the main character--

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.340
her engagement ceremony.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.900
As I said, she lives in a very
traditional household, in an

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.620
old, old mansion.

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.600
And there's a temple in
their family grounds.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.560
That's where the engagement
ceremony will take place.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.950
But this is the night before.

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.060
This part is in Korobi's
voice.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.350
The book is told
in many voices.

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.840
As a writer, I'm always
interested in how the teller

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.210
of the story changes the tale.

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.240
So different parts will
be seen in the eyes

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.270
of different people.

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.720
This is Korobi's voice.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.460
"I'm swimming through a long
underwater cavern flecked with

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:59.980
blue light--

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:04.630
the cavern of love, with
Rajat close behind me.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.930
We're in a race, and
so far I'm winning,

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.520
because this is my dream.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.430
Sometimes when I'm dreaming,
I don't know it.

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.640
But tonight, I do.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.490
I smile and feel my
mouth filling

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.050
with cool silver bubbles.

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.730
Rajat's fingers brush the
backs of my knees.

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:28.890
Even in my dream, I know that
if I slow down just a bit,

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:31.820
he'll grab my waist and
pull me to him for

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:34.420
a mischievous kiss.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.500
Imagining that kiss
sends a shudder of

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.150
pleasure through me.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:44.220
Then, out of nowhere, a
wave breaks over me.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.260
Salt and sand are
on my tongue.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.880
I try to spit them out,
but they fill my

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.080
mouth, choking me.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.960
Where is Rajat when
I need his help?

00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:00.030
Gasping, I thrash about, and
wake in my bed, tangled in my

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:02.700
bed clothes.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:07.070
As my eyes adjust to the
darkness, I know at once that

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:09.850
someone is in the room.

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:11.860
It's impossible.

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:15.290
I always lock the door before
going to sleep, and

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:17.090
the window is barred.

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:18.620
But there it is--

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:22.820
in the armchair in the corner
of the night room, a still

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:27.920
female form, black against the
darkness of the room, looking

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.080
towards me.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:35.230
'Mother?' I whisper, my fear
replaced by yearning that's as

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:40.659
old and as illogical as anything
I can remember.

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:45.150
I know so little about my
mother, only that she died 18

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:50.410
years ago, giving birth to me,
a few months after my father,

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:56.380
an ambitious law student, had
passed away in a car accident.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:59.080
Perhaps she died of
a broken heart.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.880
I never knew for sure,
because no one would

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.110
speak to me of them.

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:08.040
My grandfathers had to put aside
their own broken hearts

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.050
to care for me, and
I'm grateful.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:12.790
They did it well.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:16.700
Still, all through my years
growing up, I longed for a

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:19.860
visitation from my mother.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:24.930
Now, years after I had armored
my heart and accepted that my

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:29.720
mother was gone from my
life, here she is.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.200
How can I be sure it is her?

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:37.610
There are some things we know,
in our breath, in our bones."

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:41.620
So Korobi begins to think about
why her mother might

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:45.090
have come to see her
on this night.

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:48.670
And she figures it's because her
life is about to change.

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:50.240
She's about to get engaged.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.760
She's entering adulthood.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.930
She's going to become part
of a different family.

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:58.440
Maybe her mother is concerned
and wants to know if she's

00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.700
going to be all right.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.790
So she began to reassuring
her mother.

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:05.210
She begins telling her about
Rajat, what a wonderful man he

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:08.420
is, how much she loves him,
how much he loves her.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:12.270
But when she finishes speaking,
she feels something

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:15.640
is not quite right.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:19.020
"I'm breathless from my
confession, but still the air

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:23.260
in the room hangs uncertain,
incomplete.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.860
My mother continues to
look out the window.

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.560
Why will she not speak to me?

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:33.135
Where is the blessing kiss I've
wanted all my life, cool

00:10:33.135 --> 00:10:35.260
as a dew-drenched breeze
on my forehead?

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:42.830
Suddenly, the window behind
her is filled with light.

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:47.460
Outside, I see an ocean over
which a sun is setting.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:52.160
Have I fallen, then, from
one dream into another?

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.920
She points over the ocean,
leaning toward it with such

00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:00.750
sad longing that sorrow
twists my heart.

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:02.270
I understand.

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.600
She hasn't come to
learn about me.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.660
All the things I said to her,
she probably knew them

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:10.220
already, being dead.

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:14.870
She has appeared now, instead,
to tell me something.

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:16.590
But what?

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:19.340
Talk to me, mother.

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:23.210
This time when she turns to
me, I notice that my dream

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:26.990
mother has no mouth.

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:31.320
Her frame shivers with effort,
as though she longs to speak.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.410
She begins to dissolve.

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:37.680
I can glimpse the ocean through
her tattered body,

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.700
waves breaking apart on rocks.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:46.130
An urgent sorrow radiates from
her disappearing form.

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:50.540
Then she's gone, and I'm finally
awake, blinking in the

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:55.840
first rays of the sun entering
the room through the bars."

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.520
So Korubi is really concerned,
and she wants to understand

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:00.550
what this means.

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:03.780
And she decides that even though
her grandparents don't

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:06.670
like to talk about her mother,
she's got to ask her

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:09.630
grandmother about this
night visit.

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:10.880
And I'll read to you
what happens.

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:18.210
So this is after the engagement
ceremony, and her

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:22.280
grandmother has just cleared up
everything and said, go lie

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:25.890
down, because that's going to be
a big party in the evening

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:29.830
and you should rest.

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:32.230
" 'Grandma, wait.

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:36.970
I've got to talk to you.' I
blurt out the words because

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:39.230
there's no good way
to say them.

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:41.910
'Someone was in my
room last night.

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:45.750
I think it was my mother.'

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:49.270
I wait for grandmother to
dismiss my foolish notions

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:53.200
with a laugh and send me
off, but she pales and

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.440
takes a step back.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:59.090
The crystal dish falls from
her hand and shatters.

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:04.000
Tiny silver balls go flying
over the veranda.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.740
'Why do you think that?'
she whispers.

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.330
'I felt it.'

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:13.220
Even to my ears, my answer
sounds weak.

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.730
But grandmother accepts it.

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:17.780
Her hands are trembling.

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:19.100
'Did it--

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:25.320
did she say anything to you?' I
shake my head, disconcerted.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:28.810
I had no idea that my pragmatic
grandmother believed

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:31.580
so strongly in ghosts.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.880
But even if she did, why would
the thought of her dead

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.890
daughter's spirit agitate
her like this?

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:43.640
I realize I don't want
to know the answer.

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:47.230
'Maybe I imagined it,' I say.

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:52.030
'Maybe you did,' grandmother
says, but without conviction.

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:56.280
'I'll go lie down now.' 'You
do that,' she says.

00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:00.250
'You rest too.' 'Yes,'
she says.

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:04.420
But when I look back from the
doorway, she's still standing

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:07.940
among the broken glass,
scattered cardamom seeds

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:14.060
surrounding her like a field
of frozen tears."

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:19.320
So that's the beginning of
"Oleander Girl." And now

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.960
things are going to change very
rapidly in Korobi's life,

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:27.560
because her grandfather, whom
she loves dearly, is going to

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.350
die all of a sudden
of a heart attack.

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:35.850
And when he dies, she will
realize that he's kept a

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:38.440
secret from her all her life.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.440
And this secret will
change her whole

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.680
notion of who she is.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:45.280
It will shake up her
sense of identity.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:49.200
And she's going to have to put
off her wedding and come to

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.250
America on a search.

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:55.700
And what she discovers is part
of the story of "Oleander

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:56.640
Girl."

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.810
But "Oleander Girl" is not
just Korobi's story.

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:03.250
It's also the story of Rajat,
who is left behind.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:07.130
And this is kind of a turning
around of the hero's journey,

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:10.000
which is a mythic theme that
I used for this book.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.090
Because generally in the hero's
journey, the man goes

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:17.200
off to war or to adventure, and
the woman is the one who's

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.320
left behind.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.400
Well, in this case, Rajat is
going to be left behind,

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.650
although he will have
its own adventures.

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:26.420
Because right around this
time is when the

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:28.360
Gujarat riots happen.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:31.590
And as I said, the repercussions
will be felt all

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:35.020
the way across the country,
and especially in Rajat's

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:37.050
family's warehouse,
where Hindus and

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:38.390
Muslims work together.

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:46.250
A lot of times when I'm writing
a story, people ask

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:48.530
me, where do the story
ideas come from?

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:50.900
Is it something out
of your own life?

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:54.890
And with my previous book,
which also I came here to

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:59.330
Google to present, one amazing
thing, there was an actual

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:03.290
occurrence when we were being
evacuated from Houston, where

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:06.640
I live, because a huge
hurricane was coming.

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:10.620
And we were stuck on the freeway
in this massive,

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:12.170
massive traffic jam.

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:14.340
The hurricane was coming
right at us.

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:17.800
And all of us strangers in a
life-threatening situation

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:19.320
began to panic.

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:23.330
And that's really what give me
the idea for one amazing thing

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:25.320
where something similar
happens.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:29.480
But with this one, I really
wasn't sure of any one thing

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.030
in my life.

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:35.560
It was just ideas, thoughts,
things that I felt strongly

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:39.200
about that went into
this book.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.970
But as I wrote it, I
realized something.

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:45.910
Because a lot of times, our
writing comes out of our

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:49.340
subconscious, and we don't
even know until we finish

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:51.880
writing it where it came from.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:55.690
And as I was writing this book,
almost towards the end,

00:16:55.690 --> 00:17:02.800
I realized in some ways, this
is really my take on my own

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.240
family's story.

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.940
Not that exactly the same things
happened, but I too,

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:13.339
when I was in college, I
realized that my family had a

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:16.140
secret that they had
kept from me.

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:19.109
And that had involved my
grandfather, and it had

00:17:19.109 --> 00:17:23.069
involved the fact that long
before I was born, he

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:26.660
disinherited one of my uncles.

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:31.420
And I won't go into that story,
but somewhere in my

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:35.260
mind, in my heart, where I
really loved my grandfather

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:38.220
very much, this had created
a major conflict.

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:41.580
How could the man that I loved
so much have done something

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:43.680
like that to his own son?

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.860
And I could never
understand it.

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:49.920
But I think this book allowed
me to explore that, although

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.810
the actual secret here and what
the grandfather has done

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:55.220
is different.

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:57.360
But it was also a secret.

00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:00.840
And it was something that when
Korobi finds out, she is

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:04.360
devastated that her grandfather
could do something

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:07.950
like this and keep this
secret from her.

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:10.710
And so I think one of the things
that's at the heart of

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:14.570
this book is, what do you do
when people that you love

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:18.780
dearly, you discover something
about them that you can't

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.770
agree with, and you can't
come to terms with?

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:27.320
It's also about how family
secrets are often--

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:30.580
they really reflect on the
culture around them.

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:32.470
What is considered shameful?

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:34.880
What is considered not
OK for the family?

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.970
What has to be kept hidden?

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:41.270
And what is the result of that
which we keep hidden from

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:43.780
people when they find
out about it?

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:50.260
So anyway, that's a little bit
about "Oleander Girl." And if

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:54.010
you have questions, of course
I'd be very happy to answer

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:58.660
them, especially if they're
easy questions.

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:00.680
And as you're thinking of
questions, I'm going to say

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:04.120
one more thing, which is, I
just want to tell you, you

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:08.040
probably hear this from authors
all the time, but

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:12.110
Google has improved
my life so much.

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:17.590
It has had such a positive
influence on my research.

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:19.960
It has just made a world
of difference.

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:24.100
I really want to thank
Google for that.

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:27.540
I can just find things out just
like this through Google.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.230
So thank you.

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:33.430
The question, which is, have I
ever been sad to say goodbye

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:34.170
to a character?

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:36.430
Have I ever brought
anyone back?

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:39.650
Well, you know, you mentioned in
the introduction "Sister of

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:42.330
My Heart," which has gone
on to become a film.

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:46.430
And that was the one book where
at the end of the book--

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:49.530
the book is about two cousins,
Sudha and Anju.

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:52.320
They're very close, and they
go through a lot of life's

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.760
tribulations together.

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:54.980
They help each other.

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:57.550
They're also in a conflict
sometimes.

00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:02.410
But at the end of "Sister of
My Heart," I kind of knew

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:06.920
their story wasn't done,
somewhere deep down.

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:10.300
Because in the beginning of the
book, they're in India,

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:13.400
then they're separated through
their weddings and their

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:16.870
marriages, and then they come
together in America.

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:19.410
And at first, I'd thought
that that was the end.

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:22.150
That was the arc of their
friendship and their closeness

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:23.150
to each other.

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:27.120
But then as time went along,
I knew they had a whole new

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:31.500
story, an immigrant story in
America, where now, because

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.770
they were in a different
place, their

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:35.410
relationship was different.

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:39.990
Because sometimes that's what
happens through immigration.

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:43.250
Your relationship with people
around you changes.

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:45.360
Your notion of yourself
changes.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:49.120
So that's the one they came
back in a different novel,

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:53.990
"The Vine of Desire." And every
once in a while, I think

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:55.950
maybe they'll come back
one more time.

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.150
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much
for coming to Google.

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:02.692
I'm really excited
to read the book.

00:21:02.692 --> 00:21:05.240
I have a question about
film adaptations.

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:08.510
So I've watched "Mistress of
Spices." I haven't watched the

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:09.730
other adaptations.

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:12.570
How involved are
you with them?

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:13.810
Do you have to go?

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:15.790
Do you feel like you still
have ownership over the

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:17.370
content and get mad at them?

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:18.770
How does that work?

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:20.310
CHITTRA BANERJEE DIVAKARUNI:
That's a great question.

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:24.540
The question is about film
adaptations about my book.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:30.220
And now I've had a "Mistress of
Spices" made into a film,

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:34.390
"Sister of My Heart," a short
story from "Arranged Marriage"

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:37.090
entitled "The Word Love"
that was made

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:38.480
into a bilingual film--

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.030
English and Bengali--

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:44.580
called "Amar Ma," and actually
won some awards at Cannes.

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:46.910
And right now, one
amazing thing has

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:48.910
been optioned by Hollywood.

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:52.300
And they finished writing the
screenplay, so we're kind of

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:55.420
excited to see what the
next step will be.

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:59.720
Well, a short answer to what
control do I have?

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.010
Like, none.

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:05.306
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:05.306 --> 00:22:07.970
CHITTRA BANERJEE DIVAKARUNI: And
actually, I don't really

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:08.890
want control.

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:11.920
Because it would be like if I
were trying to write a book

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.660
and someone was telling
me what to do.

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:17.680
So if I am trying to tell the
director what they should do

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:21.980
with the book, that's really
interfering with their

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:22.990
artistic freedom.

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:26.380
So I'm perfectly OK with-- if
I like the director, I'm

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:29.570
perfectly OK with letting
them have their vision.

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:36.320
And I realized with "Mistress of
Spices," when I was reading

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.870
the screenplay that
was made by a

00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:41.520
wonderful producing company--

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:44.300
Gurinder Chadha, who made "Bend
it for Beckham," and her

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:45.960
husband Paul Berges--

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:46.910
and they had showed it--

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:50.530
I was very involved, as in they
would show me everything

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:51.440
as they were doing it.

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.130
They would call me and
ask me questions.

00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:56.300
They came and stayed out here
in California with me for a

00:22:56.300 --> 00:23:00.950
while they were discussing the
project and getting a vision.

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:03.150
So I was very involved
that way.

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:06.930
And I could see that they were
moving away from the book.

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:10.400
The romantic story, which is
part of the book, was becoming

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.930
really important.

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:14.590
And I could see why, because
they've already picked the

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:18.270
heroine, Aishwarya Rai, who has,
as you know-- who's been

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:21.000
called the most beautiful
woman in the world.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.250
And they wanted the
camera on her.

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:27.870
And I think they did a great
job, and lots of people really

00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:28.630
loved the movie.

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:30.440
I loved many parts
of the movie.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:33.380
It's different from the book,
because the book is kind of an

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:34.570
immigrant story.

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:38.380
It's the stories of all the
people who come to the store

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:42.010
where the mistress of spices
lives and works, and she helps

00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:43.770
them by giving them spices.

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:46.730
So that part became smaller, and
the romantic part became

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:48.710
larger in the movie.

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:50.480
And I realized that--

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:52.940
that's when I realized the
movie is their work.

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:54.540
The book is my work.

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:57.420
And it's perfectly all right.

00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:00.710
And I think the wonderful thing
that does happen with

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:03.240
the movie, is a lot of people
will see the movie, then

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.000
they'll come back and
read the book.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.930
And if they love the movie,
that's great.

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:09.280
They'll come and
read the book.

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:12.110
And if they read the book and
they like the book better, am

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:13.360
I going to complain?

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:19.180
So I'm excited to see what will
happen with "One Amazing

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:22.500
Thing." They're hoping to make
it a joint venture between

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:24.340
Hollywood and India.

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:29.070
So they're looking for
people on both sides.

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:31.580
And they're looking for some
money, so, you know, all you

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:34.750
Google people, if you have money
and you don't know what

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:39.470
to do with it, come
see me afterwards.

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:42.680
AUDIENCE: You mentioned in the
book that it's told partly

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:45.380
from Korobi's viewpoint,
and then later

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:47.410
from Rajat's viewpoint.

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:49.430
Did you have any trouble
switching between the two, as

00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:53.040
in like a male versus
female voice?

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:54.350
CHITTRA BANERJEE DIVAKARUNI:
That's a good question too.

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:56.130
The question is about
the different

00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:57.670
viewpoints in the book.

00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:00.610
I read to you the part in
Korobi's voice, which is in

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:01.410
first person.

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:05.000
And the question is, did I
have trouble switching?

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.720
It takes me a while
to get the voice.

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:11.800
And then once I figured out the
voice, in the later parts

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:14.010
of the novel, I won't have
trouble switching.

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:16.830
But in the early part,
I would have to try

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:18.400
like several times.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.410
The thing about this book
is, it's in first

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:22.350
person and third person.

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:25.940
So Korobi gets the first person,
where she's saying I

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:27.730
feel this, I think this.

00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:29.240
But the other parts--

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:34.440
Rajat's voice, Korobi's
grandmother Sarojini's voice--

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:36.340
they're all third person.

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:38.870
So it's what they're thinking
and what they're feeling, so

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:40.610
this a little more distance.

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:44.150
There's a little more chance
for the reader to come and

00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:46.030
interpret what's happening.

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:47.640
So that was the difference.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.840
And one of the voices that I
became really fond of, and

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:55.620
that kind of surprised me as
the novel went along, is

00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:59.440
Rajat's family chauffeur
Asif's voice.

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:02.040
And he became really important
in the story.

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:04.550
And he brings in a different
religious angle,

00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:05.950
because he's Muslim.

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:09.730
And he struggles, especially
when the Gujarat riots are

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:11.820
going on, with the idea
that he's a Muslim.

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:13.590
He's working for a Hindu.

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:18.580
And he has some trouble with
that idea when all of this

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:20.690
interracial violence,
inter-religious

00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:22.370
violence is going on.

00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:27.100
So that was an interesting voice
that I had to really

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:31.740
work at, but then I became very
happy about that voice.

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:34.930
But that's a great question.

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:37.880
I think part of your question
is, is it harder to write the

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.970
male voice than the
female voice?

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:41.060
For me, it is.

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:44.120
I have to work much harder
at the male voice.

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:47.060
The female voice just comes
naturally to me.

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:49.150
But with the male voice, I
have to think about it.

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:50.750
I have to listen to it.

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:54.600
Fortunately in my home, I have
lots of opportunity, because

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:57.530
my home is made up of my husband
and my two sons.

00:26:57.530 --> 00:27:00.040
So it's all male voices.

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:02.320
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for coming today.

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:05.210
I wanted to ask who some of your
favorite authors are, and

00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:07.360
maybe if there are any authors
who have inspired

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:08.900
you, who are they?

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:09.160
CHITTRA BANERJEE DIVAKARUNI:
Yes.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:12.660
Who are some of my favorite
authors who have inspired me?

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:16.240
Truly, I have been inspired by
so many authors, because I

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:17.970
came to writing late.

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:21.950
And I had already finished
all my formal education.

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:25.240
I was already working by the
time I started writing.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:27.820
And so most of what I
learned were from

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:29.860
books, were from authors.

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:34.210
And I've been particularly
influenced by multicultural

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:36.860
contemporary women's voices.

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:41.130
So one of the writers that I
love and I really need to

00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:43.970
quite often is Toni Morrison.

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:47.950
And just, I love the way she's
taken the African-American

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:52.960
experience and she's just made
it available to everyone

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.560
without diluting it.

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:57.100
That's something I
really aim for.

00:27:57.100 --> 00:28:01.200
I want to create the Indian or
Indian-American experience.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.510
I want to invite other people
into it, but I don't

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:04.520
want to dilute it.

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:07.540
I want to make it the
way it is, real.

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:13.380
And so her and Maxine Hong
Kingston, a Bay Area writer

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:16.150
who writes wonderfully about
the Chinese-American

00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:16.790
experience.

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:19.860
She has a book called "The Woman
Warrior" that I read

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:22.470
when I was in college when
I was going to Berkeley.

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:25.510
And I think that book really
changed my life, and it made

00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:29.880
me see my own immigration
experience differently.

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:33.690
And it also made me think that
yes, it's possible for me to

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:38.020
write the stories of the people
that I see around me,

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:42.200
that a large immigration story
of which I too am a part.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.800
So those are two that I love.

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:46.970
And for the men sitting
in this audience,

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:48.360
I do read men authors.

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:55.640
One of the Indian authors that
I love is Amitav Ghosh.

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.980
I think he is just such
a fine writer.

00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:01.490
I've learned a lot from
reading his books.

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:06.190
And a Caucasian author that
I have loved a lot is Tim

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:08.980
O'Brien, who has a wonderful
collection of

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:11.780
stories, Vietnam stories.

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:14.695
And I just love, love, love,
love those stories.

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:23.900
AUDIENCE: I'm always curious
about where writers go to put

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:25.870
together their creative
process.

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:26.990
Like, is there--

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:30.060
do you feel as though you need
to take yourself away from

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:32.980
your day-to-day and take
time to go somewhere?

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:38.790
Or do you find that the magic
of what's happening in the

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:41.270
household actually
helps contribute?

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:44.040
How is it for you when you're
writing a new book?

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.130
CHITTRA BANERJEE DIVAKARUNI:
Well, that's also a great

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:47.390
question, Regina.

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:51.460
Because as a mother, especially
when my children

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:55.080
were young, mothers who are
writers don't have that option

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:57.450
of going away.

00:29:57.450 --> 00:29:59.800
You have to do your writing
right in the middle of

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:00.600
everything.

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:04.120
So I would do my writing when my
children took naps, or when

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:07.340
they went to nursery school,
or later when they went to

00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:08.180
regular school.

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:10.020
Those were my writing hours.

00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:13.110
And pretty much, all I needed
was a quiet space.

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:16.600
I needed a quiet space where
I would not be disturbed.

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:19.610
But more than that, really,
I couldn't hope for.

00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:22.190
Because my family was there
and my family was

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:23.510
important to me--

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:26.320
so a quiet space.

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:31.640
I had to organize my schedule
as intelligently as I could,

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:34.950
so maybe I would write late in
the night or when the children

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:36.350
were at school.

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:40.080
And that's how I did it.

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.780
In fact, I think if I went away
somewhere, I would be so

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:46.170
distracted by--

00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:49.120
people sometimes say, don't you
need to go do a beautiful

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:50.860
space to write?

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:52.200
And I'm like, no.

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:56.770
In my study, I face a blank
wall, and that's how I write

00:30:56.770 --> 00:31:01.050
best, because I'm not distracted
by anything.

00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:02.360
Thank you all so much.

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:04.510
It's so wonderful to
come to Google.

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:07.530
And really, thank you for taking
time out of your busy

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:09.030
days to come.

00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:09.630
Enjoy the book.

00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:14.313
