00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.340
Before a story about toys, before monsters
went corporate, before anyone went searching

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.840
for Nemo, and before twenty seven Academy
Awards, Pixar was a high-end computer hardware

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.689
company whose clients included the government
and the medical community.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:38.170
The story of Pixar isn’t exactly full of
superheroes, adorable robots, or talking bugs.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.300
The tale of the most profitable and critically
adored animation studio in the history of

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.309
the world (yes, by sheer gross numbers, more
so than Disney) is one filled with financial

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.500
difficulties, fired Apple employees, digital
printers, and an animated left hand.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.660
And it all started with a Mormon graduate
student at the University of Utah.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.690
By the time Ed Catmull graduated from the
computer science program at University of

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.620
Utah, he was already considered a genius and
pioneer in his field.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.140
He had developed texture mapping, a method
for adding detail, texture, and color to a

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.620
computer 3-D model.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.210
In 1972, he used texture mapping to create
one of the earliest examples of 3-D computer

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.710
animation ever – an animated film of his
left hand.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.340
The one minute clip was eventually bought
by a Hollywood producer and used in the 1976

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.490
film “Futureworld” – the first full-length
film to use computer animation.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.830
Today, the clip, entitled “A Computer Animated
Hand,” is housed in the Library of Congress

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.790
after being selected for preservation in 2011
by the National Film Registry.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.541
Wealthy entrepreneur Alexander Schure ran
the New York Institute of Technology, one

00:01:41.541 --> 00:01:45.920
of the only schools in the country to focus
entirely on the technical sciences at the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.920
time.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.260
Schure believed that computer animation was
the future of storytelling, where movie making

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.260
was headed.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.220
He had been working on a film called Tubby
the Tuba.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.080
Frustrated by its slow progress, he began
buying up equipment from the more-advanced

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.689
computer labs across the country, including
the University of Utah.

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.160
That’s where he met Ed Catmull and hired
him to head his computer lab, not only for

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.560
his technical proficiency, but because they
harbored similar beliefs in computer animation

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.560
magic.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.060
Now, Catmull had a bigger stage to show off
his fantasy-making skills and, soon, Hollywood

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.120
came calling.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.260
In 1978, George Lucas was coming off a stunning
success with his space epic Star Wars: A New

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.650
Hope and was in the midst of writing and developing
The Empire Strikes Back.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.550
Though he loved writing and directing, his
goal had always been to create a movie-making

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.090
empire with his company LucasFilm.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.489
According to David Price‘s book The Pixar
Touch, George Lucas believed that film making

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.040
was “frozen in time” and wanted to modernize
the tools used.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.029
So, he turned to computers to make his special
effects division, Industrial Light &amp; Magic,

00:02:47.029 --> 00:02:48.280
the envy of Hollywood.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.959
He hired Ed Catmull to have those computers
do his bidding.

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.290
Catmull, like many people at the time, was
in awe of Star Wars, for its detailed special

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.390
effects.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.230
Even if it meant leaving Schure and New York
Institute of Technology, the place that had

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.439
given him his start, Catmull had to take his
dream job.

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:10.389
Ed Catmull joined Lucasfilm in 1979 and formed
The Graphics Group as part of the computer

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:11.389
division.

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:14.540
He brought over some of his best men and immediately
got to work.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.010
Lucas’s wishlist was immense and daunting.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.829
He wanted the group to develop a non-linear
editing system, a digital sound editing system,

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:27.159
and to dive further into how computer graphics
could revolutionize filmmaking.

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:31.969
For the next few years, the Graphics Group
hummed along with Catmull leading the way.

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:35.569
Lucas would come by often to see what “the
guys” were working on.

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.919
According to The Pixar Touch, Lucas demanded
that no one gawk at him.

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:43.430
He also wanted to be treated as if he himself
was an expert on computer graphics and hated

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.079
if anyone talked down to him.

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:49.359
By 1986, the Graphics Group had developed
computerized effects for several Hollywood

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:54.430
films, including Star Trek II: The Wrath of
Khan and Young Sherlock Holmes, but the division

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.620
was losing money.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.069
It was quite expensive to run a cutting edge
computer graphics division.

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:04.169
Catmull and company knew their time with LucasFilm
was short and began figuring out a way they

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:05.930
could strike out on their own.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.040
But they needed an investor.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.209
Luckily, the recently fired Apple CEO Steve
Jobs saw something truly unique in the computer

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:14.489
graphics division.

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.880
Jobs bought the Graphics Group for five million
dollars from LucasFim, giving him rights to

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.520
the underlying technology used, and established
an independent company named “Pixar.”

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:30.479
The name Pixar actually had been conceived
several year earlier as the title for the

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:34.030
computer component of the digital optical
printer the group had developed.

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.910
Like many of great ideas, the name was decided
upon when eating.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.650
From Karen Paik’s book on the beginnings
of Pixar, To Infinity and Beyond:

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.290
“We always had a terrible history of naming
things,” admitted Alvy Ray Smith (founding

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.880
member of the computer graphics division at
LucasFilm and longtime partner of Ed Catmull).

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.780
We could never name ourselves – We were
always the ‘the computer division.’

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.430
But it came time to name the image computer
we’d made.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.710
And one night Loren Carpenter, Rodney Stock,
and I were at this greasy spoon in Ignacico,

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.120
a town in Marin County.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:09.890
I grew up in New Mexico where Spanish is the
second language, and the infinitive form of

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:11.440
the verb always ends in ‘er,’’ir,’or
’ar.’

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.530
I suggested ‘Pixar,’ an invented Spanish
word meaning ‘to make pictures.’

00:05:14.530 --> 00:07:18.300
When Catmull and Alvy Ray Smith were looking
for investors, they knew the 

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.950
most valuable asset they had was this Pixar
Image Computer, so they named the company

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:23.950
after it.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:27.620
As you can see from this, despite the common
myth, Steve Jobs had nothing to do with naming

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:28.850
the company Pixar.

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:33.140
Steve Jobs supported Catmull, Smith, and John
Lasseter’s vision of creating an animation

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.220
studio, but he had his own agenda.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:39.670
He wanted to sell the very thing the company
was named after, the Pixar Image Computer.

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:44.930
He began marketing Pixar as a high-end computer
system company and it worked — for awhile.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:48.900
The system was sold to government agencies,
the medical research community, and other

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:53.060
companies trying to establish their own 3-D
computer model animations.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.080
One of those companies was Walt Disney.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:59.340
Eventually, due to the extremely high price
of the Pixar Image Computer and limited customer

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:03.290
base, sales for the system began plummeting
and Jobs panicked.

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:07.840
He poured more and more money into the company,
over $50 million in a five year span according

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.310
to To Infinity and Beyond.

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:13.530
Positions were cut and employees fired all
in order to save the company.

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:17.260
The dream to make the first full-length computer
animated movie was still there, but it was

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:22.230
being threatened by financial ruin and Jobs
was very seriously considering shutting the

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:26.770
company down, particularly as his other major
business at the time, NeXT Inc, was also functioning

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:30.389
as little more than a great way to rapidly
burn through millions of dollars (though with

00:08:30.389 --> 00:08:34.620
the help of Apple, Jobs would manage to make
some good money on this one too, eventually).

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:38.269
Pixar wasn’t saved by Apple, though, but
by John Lasseter.

00:08:38.269 --> 00:08:43.050
John Lasseter was first and foremost an animator
who believed that power of computer animation

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:45.740
would create never-before-seen story telling.

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:49.690
His career actually started at the Walt Disney
Company – as a skipper on the Jungle Cruise

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:50.690
ride at Disneyland.

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:54.559
Soon, he became an animator at the studios,
but he would be fired due to his obsession

00:08:54.559 --> 00:08:58.730
with computer animation and his reluctance
to let it go when asked by his superiors.

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:02.819
In 1985, he found a home with LucasFilm’s
computer division.

00:09:02.819 --> 00:09:06.269
Catmull hired Lasseter as an “Interface
Designer” because he wasn’t officially

00:09:06.269 --> 00:09:08.019
allowed to hire an animator.

00:09:08.019 --> 00:09:12.149
In order to properly sell the Pixar Image
Computer, Jobs wanted examples of what the

00:09:12.149 --> 00:09:13.829
advanced machine could do.

00:09:13.829 --> 00:09:18.379
He allowed Lasseter to lead a team in producing
short films to promote the product.

00:09:18.379 --> 00:09:23.540
Luxo Jr., a short computer animated film with
desk lamps, premiered at the annual computer

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.790
technology convention SIGGRAPH in 1986.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:27.930
It was a hit.

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.700
Later that year, it was nominated for an Academy
Award.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:35.190
Needless to say, it was a pretty good example
of what Pixar, as a hardware system and company,

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:39.889
could do, and Lasseter was able to convince
Jobs to keep the company going, focusing on

00:09:39.889 --> 00:09:44.389
making TV commercials and animated shorts
for other companies, which would in turn help

00:09:44.389 --> 00:09:46.290
market their computer system.

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:50.660
As Lasseter built up the animation division,
he brought in contracts from companies like

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:55.209
Tropicana, LifeSavers, and Listerine, with
Pixar producing ad campaigns for them.

00:09:55.209 --> 00:09:59.889
It became clear the future lay at the feet
of animation, not hardware.

00:09:59.889 --> 00:10:04.290
In 1990, Jobs sold the hardware division to
raise money to this end.

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:07.120
Even then, the company lost $8 million dollars
in 1990.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:12.209
Finally, in March of 1991, Jobs fired half
the staff and claimed he’d shut down the

00:10:12.209 --> 00:10:15.180
company if all employee stock shares weren’t
given to him.

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:19.269
This ended up working and he really did shut
the company down, but then started a new company

00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:24.350
with the same name and remaining staff, but
without employees getting shares this time.

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:28.360
As one of the aforementioned co-founders of
Pixar, Alvy Ray Smith, said in The Second

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.699
Coming of Steve Jobs,

00:10:29.699 --> 00:10:34.490
Pixar failed nine times over by normal standards,
but Steve didn’t want to fail so he kept

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:35.519
writing the checks.

00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:39.610
He would have sold us to anybody in a moment,
and he tried really hard, but he wanted to

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:41.610
cover his loss of $50 million.

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:46.970
A year later the small (and still cash-strapped)
company received its biggest commitment yet,

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:51.540
a three picture, $21 million dollar deal with
Walt Disney Studios.

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:55.440
Under this agreement, in 1995, the movie Toy
Story was made.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:59.880
In the interim, Jobs still shopped the company
around as there were a few companies interested,

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:05.089
including Microsoft, but he decided to stick
it out to see how Toy Story would do… well,

00:11:05.089 --> 00:11:07.040
as it turned out.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:11.350
Thanks to Toy Story, when Steve Jobs took
Pixar public, it became the biggest initial

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:15.180
public offering in 1995, even bigger than
Netscape.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:19.879
Because Jobs had taken back employee shares
in 1991 and gave them to himself, this resulted

00:11:19.879 --> 00:11:25.380
in him becoming a billionaire, with a net
worth of about $1.5 billion.

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:29.149
And the rest, as they say, is history.

00:11:29.149 --> 00:11:33.199
Despite initially having no product whatsoever
other than selling a t-shirt with the company’s

00:11:33.199 --> 00:11:37.180
logo, and blowing through mountains of money
while spinning their wheels, Jobs managed

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:43.020
to get Ross Perot to invest $20 million in
NeXT Inc. in exchange for just a 16% share

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:46.500
of the company that had no real assets at
the time other than the employees.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:50.499
At that rate, the company was valued at $125
million.

00:11:50.499 --> 00:11:55.100
This quite possibly was the most expensive
start-up t-shirt company in the history of

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:59.149
the world, also demonstrating how good Jobs
was at marketing.

00:11:59.149 --> 00:12:05.490
NeXT in a lot of ways was a spectacular failure,
but in other ways was a spectacular success

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:10.019
that made Jobs a lot of money and provided
the way for him to get back in with Apple

00:12:10.019 --> 00:12:12.069
via the NeXT operating system.

00:12:12.069 --> 00:12:16.420
Because of Apple’s need for such an OS,
Apple purchased NeXT for nearly half a billion

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.480
dollars, more than double the asking price
before Jobs pitched it to them (again, he

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.480
was a brilliant marketer).

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.730
This happened one year after Jobs took Pixar
public.

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:25.663
Needless to say, 1995-1996 was a good couple
years for Steve Jobs.

00:12:25.663 --> 00:12:26.663
Another factor that possibly contributed to
George Lucas selling the computer division

00:12:26.663 --> 00:12:27.663
of LucasFilm was his highly publicized 1983
divorce and the sudden dropoff of revenue

00:12:27.663 --> 00:12:28.891
from Star Wars licenses after the release
of Return of the Jedi.

00:12:28.891 --> 00:12:29.891
Lucas needed money to keep control of his
little empire and selling a part of his company

00:12:29.891 --> 00:12:30.891
for five million dollars certainly helped.

00:12:30.891 --> 00:12:31.891
If you’ve ever done much with Computer Science,
you’ve probably seen another little piece

00:12:31.891 --> 00:12:33.529
of Lasseter’s work without knowing it.

00:12:33.529 --> 00:12:37.680
Way back in the 1980s, he drew a little cartoon
demon for Free BSD.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:13:12.279
This demon went on to become the most popular
depiction of the BSD Daemon mascot.
