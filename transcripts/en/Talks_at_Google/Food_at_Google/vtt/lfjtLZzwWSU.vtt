00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.830
JACI BADZIN: Please welcome
to Google New York, Chef Paul

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:03.614
Liebrandt.

00:00:03.614 --> 00:00:04.387
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:04.387 --> 00:00:05.470
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Thank you.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.100
JACI BADZIN: We're
so glad you're here.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:07.620
PAUL LIEBRANDT:
Thank you very much.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.140
JACI BADZIN: It's an honor.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.520
PAUL LIEBRANDT:
Pleasure to be here.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.840
JACI BADZIN: So we're going
to start at the beginning.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.580
So when and how did your
interest in food start?

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.140
PAUL LIEBRANDT: When and how.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.920
I would say in my early teens.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.980
I didn't grow up from a
food background at all.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.796
So I had no family in the
business, as a lot of chefs do.

00:00:28.796 --> 00:00:30.420
It's something that
they're born into .

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.110
So it just happened, growing
up in the central London,

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.320
I grew mostly at
Chinatown, so I guess maybe

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.960
that had some connection
to food there.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.392
But I would say 12, 13,
14, around that age.

00:00:44.392 --> 00:00:45.850
JACI BADZIN: And
your first job was

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.760
at New York, New York in London.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.030
So besides that being a
sign of what was to come--

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.776
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Kind
of telling, yeah.

00:00:50.776 --> 00:00:51.526
JACI BADZIN: Yeah.

00:00:51.526 --> 00:00:53.669
What was the biggest
challenge of your early years?

00:00:53.669 --> 00:00:55.710
PAUL LIEBRANDT: At working
in New York, New York?

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.600
JACI BADZIN: Yeah.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.355
PAUL LIEBRANDT: When
I was a dishwasher--

00:01:00.355 --> 00:01:00.740
JACI BADZIN: That's--

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.560
PAUL LIEBRANDT:
--working illegally,

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.610
at 14 years old, because you're
supposed to be 16, so I lied.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.340
I'm a tall guy, so
they believed me.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.082
But the challenges?

00:01:10.082 --> 00:01:11.290
It wasn't really a challenge.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.920
It was fun.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.750
I mean, I was 14 years
old, and it was fun.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:17.590
It's just fun.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:18.970
JACI BADZIN: That's interesting.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.675
My first job was in a kitchen.

00:01:20.675 --> 00:01:22.130
It was actually--
was a waitress.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.240
I don't remember
it being that fun.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.920
But I'm glad that
you had fun with it.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.870
It's probably why you're
this amazing chef.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.130
So you mentioned
that you started

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.615
working in kitchens at 14.

00:01:32.615 --> 00:01:35.170
And you spent a lot
of your teenage years

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.470
in these restaurant kitchens.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.480
What are some of
the biggest ways

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.010
that shaped who you are today?

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.950
PAUL LIEBRANDT:
Well, I think anybody

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.430
that works in the kitchen,
in a professional kitchen,

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.290
will tell you that it really
sharpens you up, especially

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.160
in early age when
you're surrounded

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.190
in a very high pressure,
highly detailed environment,

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.380
it tends to mature
you very quick.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.060
So you tend to see that chefs in
general around the globe, when

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.910
you meet them
they're very sharp.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.540
It's just the nature
of the business.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.300
You have to be.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.944
So it matured me
very quick, quicker

00:02:09.944 --> 00:02:12.360
than I would have done if I
had gone the traditional route

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.200
of going to college,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.530
So professionally, I started at
15 and went from there, really.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.100
Didn't stop.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.030
JACI BADZIN: So talking
about your teenage years,

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.747
not only do you have
a passion for food,

00:02:28.747 --> 00:02:30.330
but you also have a
passion for music.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.790
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Hmm!

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:31.240
Absolutely.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.573
JACI BADZIN: And something
that I found very interesting

00:02:33.573 --> 00:02:36.670
was that this passion that
you'd become a DJ at illegal

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.910
raves in the early '90s.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:39.790
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Yes.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:40.498
JACI BADZIN: Yes.

00:02:40.498 --> 00:02:41.560
Very fun time.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.110
PAUL LIEBRANDT:
That was fun, yes.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.020
JACI BADZIN: Do you
see any similarities

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.620
for how you mixed music back
then and how you create food?

00:02:53.985 --> 00:02:55.360
PAUL LIEBRANDT:
Well, the process

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.610
of DJing an illegal rave
is you'd find a space,

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.885
break in illegally, phone
a number on a Friday night

00:03:00.885 --> 00:03:02.260
and everybody
would just show up.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.190
So restaurants aren't quite--
well, maybe they are the same,

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.910
but restaurants are a little
more organized than that.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.970
The mixing part of it, to me
it's about taking two things

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.400
and creating something
new and different

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.920
from two things which
already existed.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.750
So whether we take a
carrot and a parsnip,

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.550
and we make something
out of it or we

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.310
take a rhythm of one
track or another,

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.110
and we mix them into
creating something

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.650
else-- the technique and
the feel and the sensibility

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.440
is the same.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.110
And it's about using your
senses and your intuition

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.370
with what's there
in front of you

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.340
and creating your own
personal twist on it.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.760
So for me, yeah, there's
a lot of similarity

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.400
in that aspect of it, yes.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.670
Not the illegal aspect,
just the food part of it.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.210
JACI BADZIN: Well,
I bet you would

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.164
have an amazing underground
food dining restaurant.

00:03:54.164 --> 00:03:55.830
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Damn,
it was fun though.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:56.689
Yeah.

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:57.980
JACI BADZIN: It was a fun time.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.170
And yes, I am old
enough to remember that.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.220
Many of you here aren't.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.330
But it was a pretty fun time.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.170
If you could go back
to your early years,

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.650
is there a restaurant
or location

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.520
that you would train at?

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.060
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Yes.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.300
There was a very, very
famous chef in France

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.430
called Alain Chapel, who
passed away far too early,

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.800
in his early '50s in Mionnay,
in the middle of France.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.050
It was before my time.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:32.030
But that was one of those great,
great chefs who really turned

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.840
classical French cooking and
put his creative spin on it

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.040
in a way which nobody
had really seen.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.170
I mean, Ducasse
trained with him.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.520
This was the gentlemen that
really redefined what today--

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.430
our generation
and the generation

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.200
before us really do with
food, the creative aspect.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.719
So for me, that is the one
gentleman that I would have

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:57.260
loved to-- I would have actually
just eaten at his restaurant

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.130
while he was still
there, but I was far too

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.310
young to obviously do it.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.050
But yes, that would
be the gentleman.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.950
JACI BADZIN: That's amazing.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.510
So talking about the
book for a bit-- so you

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.640
say that this book
isn't quite a memoir.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.320
And it's not a cookbook.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.702
But you call it a
literary tasting menu.

00:05:16.702 --> 00:05:17.910
PAUL LIEBRANDT: It's correct.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.076
JACI BADZIN: It's very cool.

00:05:19.076 --> 00:05:21.890
Can you tell us what that means?

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.920
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Well, a
literary tasting menu.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.670
As with a tasting
menu, as with anything

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.300
where there are
multiple scenes or there

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.200
are multiple choruses or
rhythms or whatever to it,

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.465
it tells a story.

00:05:38.465 --> 00:05:41.290
And that's the most
important part of it.

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.317
A tasting menu, when you
have a great tasting menu,

00:05:44.317 --> 00:05:46.400
There should be a beginning,
a middle, and an end.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.287
And there's ebb and
flow to the whole thing,

00:05:48.287 --> 00:05:50.870
much the same way as when you
go and see an opera or something

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:51.970
similar.

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.370
So the book, we wanted to
have the same feel to it.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.080
It's not a memoir,
because I'm simply not

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.230
old enough to have that.

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.660
It's a story.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.310
It's not a cookbook,
because I didn't

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:04.400
want to do 100 recipes in
pictures like a textbook.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.520
So it's something which tells
a story in a narrative that

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.320
is something that you
could follow through

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.890
like a tasting menu
and arrive at the end

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.490
and make your own mind up on
whether you enjoyed it or not.

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:17.670
JACI BADZIN: Well, I
think it's definitely--

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:19.961
PAUL LIEBRANDT: It's definitely
isn't one or the other.

00:06:19.961 --> 00:06:22.061
It's something which we
tried to do which would--

00:06:22.061 --> 00:06:23.560
I wouldn't say break
the mold, but I

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.500
would say do something
different, not do the same.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.180
JACI BADZIN: It's
definitely different.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.695
It's definitely--
reading the book,

00:06:30.695 --> 00:06:34.110
I hadn't experienced something
like that with it's your story,

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.430
but then you have
these beautiful photos.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.680
And then there's recipes
that are ingrained,

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.780
but they don't
overpower the book,

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.680
I think your story
definitely shines.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.770
And the images are amazing.

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.150
It's a really beautiful book.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:50.340
There's great imagery, between
the food that you create

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.620
and these great shots that
are taken in the kitchen.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.220
PAUL LIEBRANDT:
We had Evan Song,

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.830
who's a genius photographer,
do the beautiful, beautiful

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:58.330
photographs.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.340
And I said that he
makes my job easy,

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:04.220
because he makes it look far
better than I think it actually

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.450
is.

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.696
JACI BADZIN: How long
did you work on the book?

00:07:08.696 --> 00:07:10.820
PAUL LIEBRANDT: About three
years, start to finish.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.444
JACI BADZIN: That
actually seems pretty

00:07:12.444 --> 00:07:14.950
quick for a book of that size.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:16.260
PAUL LIEBRANDT: We work quick.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.982
JACI BADZIN: Yes, you do.

00:07:17.982 --> 00:07:20.440
Another point in your book,
which I thought was interesting

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.130
is you reference
food as "the food."

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:24.910
Can you describe
what that difference

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:29.160
is for you between
food and the food?

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.450
PAUL LIEBRANDT: I would say
it harks back to maybe a more

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:37.410
classic kind of approach, where
for me what I do for a living--

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:39.250
I still feel this I
will [INAUDIBLE]--

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.750
it's there's a
reference for what I do.

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:43.740
The food.

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.230
The vocational act
of the profession

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:49.790
that I've chosen is to
nourish, is to feed people.

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:50.880
It's very basic.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:51.720
It's a basic thing.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.110
But there's something which
is very reverent about it.

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:57.960
And for me, the
food, I feel honored

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.150
to be able to do
this for a living.

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:04.170
So when I say the food, I
say it in a very respectful

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:09.430
and very almost-- I
would say religious term

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:14.740
of it's something which I
do to please other people.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:15.780
It's not just a job.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:16.510
It's not food.

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:19.300
It's something I
hold much higher.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.209
JACI BADZIN: An art.

00:08:20.209 --> 00:08:21.500
PAUL LIEBRANDT: No, not an art.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:22.430
It's a craft.

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.160
JACI BADZIN: I was going
to say and then I felt art.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.120
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Yes,
there's artistic.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:25.990
Of course there is.

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:26.820
The aesthetic is--

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.620
JACI BADZIN: The food
on the plate is artwork.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.120
PAUL LIEBRANDT: But
this is a craft.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.870
As an artist, I can come in
one day and cook a great meal

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.890
and then not come back the
next day and not have to do it.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.640
Because that's art.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.659
As a craftsman,
which I view myself

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:44.130
as a craftsman, albeit maybe an
artistic craftsman, every day

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:47.350
I have to come in and
deliver to the same level.

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:49.720
Because that's where the
consistency and that's where

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.920
the expectation for
the guest comes in.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.980
So for me that's
really what it's about.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.860
And it's a long process.

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.240
And it takes
decades and decades.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.530
But it's that continual
just chipping away.

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:03.350
As somebody who's a sculptor,
just everything they do

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:05.810
is just they're chipping
away to get the perfect form.

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:07.170
Or a painter.

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:09.040
It doesn't happen overnight.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:13.706
So for me, the reverence, the
rigor, all of that, the food.

00:09:13.706 --> 00:09:15.330
JACI BADZIN: The food.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:16.240
You do it very well.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.888
PAUL LIEBRANDT: We try hard.

00:09:17.888 --> 00:09:19.770
JACI BADZIN: You succeed.

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:22.090
So the book guides
us through some

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:25.160
of the most famed restaurant
kitchens in the world.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.700
Are there any crazy stories
that you excluded from the book

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:28.820
that you can share with us now?

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:29.900
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Many,
many, many, many.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:30.520
Yes.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.061
JACI BADZIN: Can you share one
of your favorites with us now?

00:09:34.895 --> 00:09:36.770
PAUL LIEBRANDT: But this
is going on YouTube,

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:38.978
so there'll be like children
and stuff watching this,

00:09:38.978 --> 00:09:42.523
so I shouldn't
really say anything

00:09:42.523 --> 00:09:44.080
that might get me in trouble.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.704
JACI BADZIN: Not to
get you in trouble.

00:09:45.704 --> 00:09:47.500
Maybe one of your
favorite stories

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:48.642
from when you were younger?

00:09:48.642 --> 00:09:50.100
PAUL LIEBRANDT:
When I was younger.

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.050
Gosh, those were the days.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:59.900
So when I was working back
in London, one that I do

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:05.350
remember-- and you know,
the great British actors--

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:08.350
they have a very-- there's
a quirkiness about them

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:10.340
if you ever meet any of
the great British ones.

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:14.490
Richard Harris, who played
Dumbledore in the first "Harry

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:17.220
Potter" films was
one of those guys.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.382
And I worked at a
restaurant called L'Escargot

00:10:19.382 --> 00:10:21.090
in London, still
there-- beautiful place,

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:22.830
been there since 1927.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:24.650
Grand, classical--
but a very small one.

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:26.070
Almost like a big townhouse.

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:28.220
So I was in the top
restaurant, very small.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.650
And there were only three
of us in the kitchen.

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:33.730
And Richard Harris
comes in one night

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:38.990
and-- this is obviously
before "Harry Potter" films--

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:44.670
and came into the kitchen and
proceeded to take his shirt off

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:47.800
and asked everybody if he could
bum a cigarette off everybody.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.030
I don't even smoke, so I
couldn't help him there.

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:51.530
But took his shirt
off-- and I think

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:55.530
he was kind of drunk-- took
his shirt off-- it was summer.

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:59.000
He said he was hot-- and when
he said can I have a cigarette,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.340
in the middle of us
cooking his dinner,

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:04.310
and then walked out of the
restaurant, down the street,

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:06.920
asking everybody on the street
apparently, so I was told,

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.342
and the maitre d' had to chase
after him and lead him back

00:11:09.342 --> 00:11:10.300
to the restaurant and--

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:10.855
JACI BADZIN: That's amazing.

00:11:10.855 --> 00:11:12.355
PAUL LIEBRANDT:
--take him upstairs.

00:11:12.355 --> 00:11:14.120
But he's no longer with us.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.770
God bless him, so
I can say that one.

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:18.140
But there are a lot more
but, again, children

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:19.490
might watch this, so I don't
want to offend any parents.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:20.560
JACI BADZIN: That's a great one.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.650
And it's a great "Harry
Potter" reference [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:23.317
do for the kids.

00:11:23.317 --> 00:11:25.816
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Yeah, I mean,
"Harry Potter," it's all true.

00:11:25.816 --> 00:11:26.430
It's all true.

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:28.885
You know, that was my
childhood growing up in London.

00:11:28.885 --> 00:11:30.910
JACI BADZIN: That's so great.

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:33.540
Something else in the
book you talk about

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.950
is your experience at
a "Star Wars" marathon

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:36.784
when you were a kid.

00:11:36.784 --> 00:11:37.783
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Oh yeah.

00:11:37.783 --> 00:11:40.000
JACI BADZIN: And how you
were drawn to Darth Vader.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.708
And I thought it was
an interesting story

00:11:41.708 --> 00:11:43.050
to find in a chef's book.

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:46.190
So many Googlers here,
I'm sure you know,

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:48.450
are "Star Wars" fans,
so I have to ask

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:50.940
why does that moment
stand out for you?

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.189
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Because it
was a "Star Wars" marathon.

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.830
This is what? '83 when
"Return of the Jedi"

00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:59.600
came out, so I was
seven years old.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.635
And it was my birthday.

00:12:00.635 --> 00:12:03.170
And my father-- there was an
old theatre called the Dominion

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:05.850
Theatre, a very famous theatre
at the beginning of Tottenham

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:06.460
Court Road.

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.422
And they had the trilogy on.

00:12:08.422 --> 00:12:09.630
And they had all three films.

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:11.435
And it had been timed
with the release

00:12:11.435 --> 00:12:13.760
of "Return of the Jedi."

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.337
And my brother
said, right, we're

00:12:15.337 --> 00:12:16.420
going to go watch a movie.

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:17.630
And I went, great, OK.

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:20.570
So then we went for eight
hours or whatever it was,

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:24.270
of just watching
all three in a row.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:25.630
And it was memorable.

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:26.210
Oh yeah.

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:26.940
JACI BADZIN: I can imagine.

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.315
PAUL LIEBRANDT:
I wouldn't says I

00:12:28.315 --> 00:12:29.970
was drawn to Darth
Vader in particular,

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:32.800
just the whole vision of
the whole thing I think

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.534
is quite stunning,
quite stunning.

00:12:34.534 --> 00:12:36.700
JACI BADZIN: Are you still
a fan of the "Star Wars."

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:40.380
PAUL LIEBRANDT: I can't
wait for next year or 2016

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:42.800
or whenever it is when
they do the new one.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:43.944
Oh, JJ Abrams's doing it.

00:12:43.944 --> 00:12:45.110
I'm very excited about that.

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:46.100
JACI BADZIN: I actually
didn't know that.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:48.420
Did anybody here know that
JJ Abrams was doing the--

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:49.460
PAUL LIEBRANDT:
JJ is of course--

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:50.020
JACI BADZIN: Yeah, of
course, who am I kidding?

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:50.920
Everybody's like yes.

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.440
You're in good company here.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.900
So what was your favorite
discovery writing this book?

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:00.740
PAUL LIEBRANDT:
It's kind of funny.

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:02.680
It's like when we did the movie.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.420
We filmed the movie over
10 years, 9 and 1/2 years.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:10.250
So when you talk about your past
and then you compile it over

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:13.010
time, and then when
you look back on it,

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:15.302
you learn something
about yourself.

00:13:15.302 --> 00:13:17.260
So whether it be from a
narrative point of view

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.010
with the book, where I'm talking
about things that I hadn't

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:24.170
thought about in years, but
for the purposes of this story

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:26.290
that we were compiling
here, we were

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:28.174
talking about it, and
memories and things.

00:13:28.174 --> 00:13:29.590
And the same thing
with the movie.

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:31.215
When you look at
yourself from a decade

00:13:31.215 --> 00:13:33.220
ago-- when you kind
of cringe and go oof,

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:36.670
really-- you learn a lot.

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:38.890
Some good, some bad,
some things which

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:41.830
inspire you for the future.

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:43.400
My love of Chinese
food, I guess,

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.940
I know where it comes from now.

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:45.300
JACI BADZIN: Yeah.

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:45.910
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Yeah.

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:46.880
JACI BADZIN: Growing
up near Chinatown.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:47.940
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Yeah,
directly opposite.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:48.690
JACI BADZIN: Yeah.

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:51.120
It's very cool.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.370
What is one cookbook,
besides your own,

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:55.620
that people should have?

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:57.680
Well, actually, yours is
a literary tasting menu,

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:01.500
but besides that book, what
is in a book about food

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:06.851
or a cookbook that
people should own?

00:14:06.851 --> 00:14:08.600
PAUL LIEBRANDT: One
of the first cookbooks

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.433
I ever bought, and
again, I wouldn't call it

00:14:10.433 --> 00:14:12.480
a necessary
cookbook, but for me,

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.540
what sold me on the
profession of what I do now

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:19.710
was "White Heat" by Marco
Pierre White, which again,

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:22.760
the visual aspect of it--
because cooking, by nature,

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.020
is a repetitive act.

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:25.080
You come every day.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.322
You do the same thing.

00:14:26.322 --> 00:14:28.780
And that's good, because that's
the nature of the business.

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:30.770
You get better by doing that.

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:33.930
But a cookbook is
the same thing.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:37.070
If it's 100 pages and 100
recipes and 100 pictures,

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:38.757
and you flip through,
it can look good

00:14:38.757 --> 00:14:40.090
and you can reference something.

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:41.340
But generally you put it back.

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:42.548
You put it back on the shelf.

00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:44.730
And it sits in a
lovely collection.

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:46.860
"White Heat," at
least for me, and I

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.170
think for a few other
people, was the first book

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:50.880
where it wasn't like that.

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.960
There was stunning food
shots and stunning recipes,

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.540
but Bob Carlos Clarke's
beautiful photography

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.750
of really capturing
what it's like to be

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:00.170
in a professional kitchen.

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:03.820
The sweat, the blood,
the tears, the tension,

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.070
you see it in the photographs.

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:06.840
It was the first
thing for me that

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:09.020
really said I want to do that.

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.770
That's what I want to do.

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:12.580
I want to make my
life in the kitchen.

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.720
And most people would
look at it and go "oof,"

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.130
because it's gruesome.

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:17.300
I mean, it's grueling.

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:18.580
It looks grueling.

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:19.270
No.

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:21.170
I was enveloped by it.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:22.910
So for me, I think
that is the book

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:25.420
that any young cook
should look at.

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:27.374
And it's a very,
very realistic view

00:15:27.374 --> 00:15:29.540
of what it's like to work
in a professional kitchen.

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:30.630
JACI BADZIN: It is.

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:32.172
People say that it was one
of-- like you're saying,

00:15:32.172 --> 00:15:32.730
it's a first.

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:33.080
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Iconic.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:33.440
JACI BADZIN: Yeah.

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.560
PAUL LIEBRANDT:
It's iconic, yeah.

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:35.450
It broke the mold.

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:35.950
It did.

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:38.900
Before that, it was the sort
of typical portly French chef

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:41.220
with the giant white hat,
standing there like this,

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:43.155
with a cockerel under his arm.

00:15:43.155 --> 00:15:44.310
And that's wonderful.

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:45.440
But that's not real.

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:49.910
The realisms are it's sweaty,
it's hot, you're tired,

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:53.780
you're undernourished, you
have wet hands all the time.

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:54.670
You cut yourself.

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:55.900
People scream at you.

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.500
That's the kitchen.

00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.300
It is what it is.

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.960
I mean, that's the nature of
the business that we're in.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.000
Thank God it's
gotten better than

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.390
when I first started
over 20 years ago.

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:09.870
But I still think that it's
important to understand

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:12.620
the building blocks of
why we do what we do.

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:15.500
We're there to cook for people.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:20.390
JACI BADZIN: Did you see in
kitchens and kitchens style,

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:25.312
kitchen etiquette, between
London and Europe and New York?

00:16:25.312 --> 00:16:26.520
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Very much so.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:32.960
I think Europe has more--
just simply because Europe

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.410
has more of an
older lineage when

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:38.570
it comes to culinary history
that this country does, just

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:40.340
by the nature of it's Europe.

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:45.300
I mean, you see that the
French brigade system is still

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:46.280
very much ingrained.

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.960
And the whole reason for
me coming to this country,

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.750
and to New York
specifically, was

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:52.900
I wanted to get away from that.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.170
It's like growing up in the
class system in England.

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:58.620
Your place in life and
you'll never get any higher,

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:02.190
because you're not born into
a certain kind of hierarchy.

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:04.940
It's changed now because,
you know, the world changes.

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:07.530
But kitchens-- the
difference is very

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:09.020
much like that in a kitchen.

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:10.390
You work for the right people.

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:12.130
And then you've
got the totem pole.

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:14.210
Here, the refreshing
thing is it really

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:19.069
is-- you make it on your
own work for the most part.

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:22.410
But there's a big
difference there.

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:22.910
Europe.

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:25.109
I think it's changing
more now, in regards

00:17:25.109 --> 00:17:27.940
to more young chefs doing
their own personal style, which

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:29.710
is great.

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:32.430
And the world is obviously
a much bigger place

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:33.290
in terms of that.

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:35.240
There's more options now.

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:38.467
So kitchens have definitely
changed a lot, for the better.

00:17:38.467 --> 00:17:40.550
JACI BADZIN: What about
when you came to New York?

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:43.730
What was one of the biggest
surprises or biggest challenges

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:51.680
that you faced as a non-American
in a New York kitchen?

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.620
PAUL LIEBRANDT:
Well, A, my accent.

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:58.830
And vice-- and I talk about
this in the book-- vice versa.

00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:04.070
Me understanding the
American terminology,

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:06.390
especially working with
people from California

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:10.690
who would have this very sort
of bro-speak kind of way, which

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:12.950
I had no idea what
they were saying.

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:15.240
I remember there's a gentleman
that I worked at Poulet

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.844
and he was working on
this side of the stove.

00:18:18.844 --> 00:18:20.510
I was working on this
side of the stove.

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:25.460
And he would look at me and say,
hey, guy, can I take my guy,

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:27.155
and write it in your guy?

00:18:27.155 --> 00:18:30.880
When I [STAMMERING]-- like what?

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:33.770
That translated into can
I take this piece of lamb

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:36.764
and braise it in the
choux that you're making?

00:18:36.764 --> 00:18:39.180
I didn't know that, because
everyone else seemed to, but I

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:39.830
didn't.

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:40.330
True story.

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:41.038
JACI BADZIN: Wow.

00:18:41.038 --> 00:18:41.990
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Yeah.

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:43.156
But little things like that.

00:18:43.156 --> 00:18:46.730
And my terminology-- so
that actually sounds silly,

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:49.091
but when you're in a
kitchen, it's quick.

00:18:49.091 --> 00:18:49.590
Like this.

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:50.390
All the time.

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:52.470
And you've got to be very
sharp and on the ball.

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:54.950
And a lot of it is
sensibility, like I say,

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:58.480
where you have a good team of
guys and girls in the kitchen.

00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:59.540
And there's that look.

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.020
It's that sensibility.

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:02.250
It's a nod.

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:04.900
And you know, if there's
course adjustments--

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:06.690
service is like going to war.

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:09.670
You plan, but as soon as you
go into it, things change.

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:10.740
You have to adapt.

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:15.530
So I think that was
actually, for me, a big one.

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:18.700
And also people eat
very quickly here,

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:21.210
as opposed to Europe,
because in Europe, you

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:23.630
go to a fine restaurant,
you're there for the night.

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:24.520
Right?

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:26.510
Three, four hours-- normal.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:27.810
And that's part decor.

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:29.800
Here, it's hour
and a half, bang.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:30.490
You want to go.

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:32.320
And the volume aspect.

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.590
Fine dining in Europe-- you
go to a beautiful restaurant.

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:38.020
It's 30 covers, 30
people, 40 people.

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:39.040
That's it.

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:41.546
Here, it was like
100 plus people.

00:19:41.546 --> 00:19:42.670
I'm like, how do you do it?

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:44.830
Organization.

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:45.920
That's how you do it.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.497
So I think that was a
big one, big one for me.

00:19:48.497 --> 00:19:50.330
JACI BADZIN: That's
really interesting thing

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:54.840
about that differentiation and
then also-- I mean, it is true.

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.710
I forget how fast we eat.

00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:59.870
Sometimes in New York, a
little bit slower, maybe.

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:03.740
But yeah, it is a definite
different experience,

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:05.680
which translates to
the kitchen in such

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.638
a completely different
way, in terms of covers.

00:20:07.638 --> 00:20:11.100
PAUL LIEBRANDT: You have to
work in a very different way.

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:14.370
JACI BADZIN: So kind of
talking more about present,

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:18.870
do you feel that dining in
general is being repositioned?

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:21.450
PAUL LIEBRANDT: As far as--

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:24.530
JACI BADZIN: Fine dining,
more of casual dining.

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:27.950
Do you think that there's
still a place for fine dining?

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:29.676
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Of course.

00:20:29.676 --> 00:20:30.175
Absolutely.

00:20:30.175 --> 00:20:32.550
JACI BADZIN: And if so, how
is it being redefined though.

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:35.330
PAUL LIEBRANDT: You
know, this is the thing.

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:38.790
In any form, there's
a building block.

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:41.960
So art, there's a building
block of fine art.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.690
Music, same thing.

00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:51.060
Winemaking, the folks at
Petrus make Petrus wine

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:53.780
the same way that they
did 100 years ago.

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:58.580
Is it going to go out of
fashion 50 years from now?

00:20:58.580 --> 00:20:59.324
I don't think so.

00:20:59.324 --> 00:21:01.740
I think it's going to be harder
for them with the climate.

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:04.700
But I think it's not going
to go out of fashion.

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:07.350
The way I look upon it is
like any great art form,

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:09.410
let's say, like
opera, for example.

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:11.185
100 years ago, people
went to the opera.

00:21:11.185 --> 00:21:12.560
When they went to
the opera, they

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.960
wore top hat, white
gloves, tails, cane,

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.510
because that's what you did
when you went to the opera.

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:22.907
You go to the same opera here
that was playing 100 years ago,

00:21:22.907 --> 00:21:24.740
people don't want wear
gloves and a top hat.

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:26.698
But they'll put on a suit
and they'll enjoy it.

00:21:26.698 --> 00:21:30.120
But they still want the
same feel, the sensibility.

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.130
They want the same
idea that they're

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:35.450
going to see something which
is classic and beautiful.

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:36.880
Fine dining is the same.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.670
I think there will
always be room

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:42.430
for well prepared,
good ingredients

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:47.040
and expertly crafted
product, like a sports car,

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.010
like anything.

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:48.920
There's room for it.

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:52.350
But how people approach it and
how they want to experience

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:55.030
it is different.

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:56.300
You talk about fine dining.

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:58.424
I think it's very interesting
that you look at now,

00:21:58.424 --> 00:22:03.280
the younger people experience
fine dining at an earlier age

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.510
now than they did,
let's say, 40 years ago,

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:08.690
where if you went to a
fine dining restaurant,

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:10.107
of like a Michelin
three-star, you

00:22:10.107 --> 00:22:11.606
would look at the
dining room and it

00:22:11.606 --> 00:22:13.100
would be a certain age group.

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.950
It would be an older
clientele, because that

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:17.490
was what could afford it.

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:22.100
And that was what was deemed
as like that's what you do.

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:25.784
Nowadays, the dynamic's changed.

00:22:25.784 --> 00:22:27.700
Younger people have more
money in their pocket

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:30.420
than they do 50 years ago.

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:31.650
They can afford it.

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:34.070
And people want to
experience that.

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:38.850
And so the way that you
change your new rhythm of how

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:41.810
you do a restaurant of
the style that we do

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:47.510
is you got to make it seem
attractive to a younger

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:50.200
clientele, to a more worldly
clientele, because people

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.710
travel around the
world now solely

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:54.640
for gastronomic experiences.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:55.520
You go on holiday.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.590
You have eating experiences.

00:22:57.590 --> 00:23:01.770
So if you go to Hong Kong or
Asia-- I mean, I do it too.

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:04.150
You make a list of the
restaurants you want to go to,

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:08.911
as opposed to maybe 50 years
ago, it was sites or a museum.

00:23:08.911 --> 00:23:09.660
Do you understand?

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:10.670
JACI BADZIN: It's very true.

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:11.295
That's so true.

00:23:11.295 --> 00:23:13.450
PAUL LIEBRANDT: So
the dynamic of how

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:18.640
we produce what we produce, how
we do it, the setting the feel,

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:21.810
the tone, the touch, all of it,
we have to move with the times.

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:23.980
And I think there's
nothing wrong with that.

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:25.320
That's normal.

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.670
So it's not a question of
that fine dining's dying.

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:29.600
It's not a question that
people don't want it.

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.860
It's a question of
how you approach it,

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:33.720
how you deliver it.

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:37.020
A nicely cooked piece of fish
is still a nicely cooked piece

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:39.890
of fish that people can enjoy.

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:44.605
It's a question
that a lot of people

00:23:44.605 --> 00:23:46.570
would probably disagree with me.

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:49.002
But that's the way I see it.

00:23:49.002 --> 00:23:49.940
And it's a good thing.

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:51.230
It's a relevant thing.

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:53.352
You know, it's forward thinking.

00:23:53.352 --> 00:23:54.810
JACI BADZIN: Do
you see this more--

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:58.250
do you see it being
redefined on a global scale

00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:01.004
or do you think that it's
going to be national,

00:24:01.004 --> 00:24:02.420
that what we could
see in New York

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:05.210
is going to be vastly different
than what we'd see in London?

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:05.790
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Oh, no, no, no.

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:06.687
It's a global.

00:24:06.687 --> 00:24:07.270
It's a global.

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:09.180
If you travel around
the world and you eat,

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:11.330
you see that what
people do in London

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:15.570
is echoing of what we do here
in New York, and vice versa.

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:18.795
And you go to Hong Kong,
you see restaurants

00:24:18.795 --> 00:24:21.920
that are echoing what is
happening in Spain or France.

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.340
And it's a global thing.

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:28.530
It's not one particular
part of the world or city.

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:30.960
What I think is
very interesting is

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:34.420
different cultures and
different ways of eating

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:35.910
and the sort of
cross pollination

00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:39.340
when it comes to a style
of cuisine blending

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:41.190
with a French-style cuisine.

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:45.060
For example, Ferran
Adria with elBulli

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:49.530
and the whole Spanish movement
of very molecular, very

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:52.990
technique-driven, very
almost pastry-driven style

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:56.010
of cooking, redefining the
entire way that we organize

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:59.340
our kitchens ourselves
and how we approach food

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:01.840
and taking away
the dogmatic view

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:04.340
of a French-style of eating.

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:07.880
Now it's morphed into
a Nordic kind of thing.

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.530
And the next one is going
to be South America.

00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:13.900
And that brings a new
world to us as chefs

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:17.710
and to customers, because that
makes ingredients, for example,

00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:23.330
in the Amazonian basin,
which it is becoming

00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:26.660
and will be the next big global
trend available to people

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:30.410
globally, which
people had no idea.

00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:32.010
I doubt most people--
I mean, maybe

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:35.122
you have, but have had
fresh cashew nut pulp.

00:25:35.122 --> 00:25:36.080
JACI BADZIN: I haven't.

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:38.034
Anybody here?

00:25:38.034 --> 00:25:40.200
PAUL LIEBRANDT: It's unlike--
you can't describe it.

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.190
It doesn't taste
anything like the nut.

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:45.260
But it's one thing which
is very, very specific

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:46.650
to that part of the world.

00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:48.670
Things like this,
which-- it's great.

00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:49.420
It's a good thing.

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:50.170
It's how we learn.

00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:52.690
It's how food evolves.

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:54.970
And I think it's a
really exciting time.

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:56.910
JACI BADZIN: That's
very, very true.

00:25:56.910 --> 00:25:59.372
I want to try that, for sure.

00:25:59.372 --> 00:26:00.830
Think we can get
it here at Google?

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:02.750
PAUL LIEBRANDT: I'm sure
Google can source it.

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:04.791
JACI BADZIN: [LAUGHS] I
bet Google can source it.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:09.100
So in this digital
age, how do you

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:11.800
see technology changing
the way you cook

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.270
and how you approach food?

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:15.980
Do you see it having
any effects on how

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:19.190
the kitchen is run concurrently?

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:21.200
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Absolutely.

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:24.997
Technology has always gone
hand in hand with cooking,

00:26:24.997 --> 00:26:27.455
whether it be the hard equipment
that we use in the kitchen

00:26:27.455 --> 00:26:31.700
or whether it be the precision
elements like sous vides,

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:33.430
for example.

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:37.430
The apparatus to get
good consistent results

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:38.830
is now more affordable.

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:40.860
It's easy to use.

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:44.290
| I think that right there
is technology working

00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:47.730
for the betterment
of us as chefs.

00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:49.810
And then we pass our
results on to the consumer.

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:53.960
So they have experience in
the hands of a skilled chef.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:58.960
I think what is very interesting
is the sensory aspect of dining

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:02.210
and technology and how that
translates to the future,

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:04.910
and how it will
translate to the future.

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:10.990
Andoni just at Madrid
Fusion presented on this app

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:13.070
that you can smell.

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:13.830
JACI BADZIN: Wow.

00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:15.170
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Like scratch
and sniff kind of thing

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:15.947
on your phone.

00:27:15.947 --> 00:27:16.780
JACI BADZIN: No way.

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:17.650
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Yeah.

00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:20.316
That you can plug it in, and you
can scratch it and it will give

00:27:20.316 --> 00:27:23.102
you smells like when
you're reading a book.

00:27:23.102 --> 00:27:25.060
I'm not saying that we're
all going to do that,

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:28.970
but I think at least it's
an interesting idea, that

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:30.990
can morph into something else.

00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:34.070
I think if you look at, let's
say, the espuma kind of stuff,

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:37.970
a siphon, like a
cream dispenser.

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:40.430
20 years ago, Ferran
was the first guy really

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:41.980
to really utilize that.

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:45.190
A whipped cream dispenser with
a cartridge which you put in,

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:47.970
which was used for whipped
cream, and flavor it, and then

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:50.890
doing hot and cold
and different things.

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:53.100
It's a whip cream dispenser.

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:56.300
Nowadays, any modern
kitchen globally has one.

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:59.320
Because it's the same
as a pot or a pan.

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.270
You have to have
one, because it's

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:05.030
become part of that
necessary apparatus.

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:07.510
So I think that was
technology right there,

00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:08.700
and how it led into.

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:13.330
Sous vide is becoming or has
become, in every modern kitchen

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:14.860
around the globe,
the same thing.

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:18.130
So it's very, very important.

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:20.000
We use it, always have done.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.410
I think it's important.

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:25.110
But ultimately, the best
technology is what's in here.

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:25.920
And what--

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:27.060
JACI BADZIN: What's
there and here.

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:27.893
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Yes.

00:28:27.893 --> 00:28:29.440
Exactly.

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:33.540
JACI BADZIN: So along
the lines of technology,

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:36.420
not so much
technically speaking,

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:40.790
but this film-- I want to
bring up the film that you did.

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:43.800
And the documentary
that was made about you

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:47.420
and the current day and age,
how everything is so real time,

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:50.430
and everyone wants
to be on TV or film,

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:55.380
or have that kind of fame after
you, if you will, celebrity.

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:58.400
What would you tell them
about your experience

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.820
of being in an HBO documentary?

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:09.150
Did it have any effect on your
life as a chef, on your career?

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:13.160
Was there parts of it that
you wish would not have been--

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.610
PAUL LIEBRANDT:
First, let me explain,

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:20.560
because we did this documentary
but A, when we started

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:22.850
filming-- the director,
Sally, started filming,

00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:25.510
it was never meant
to be a documentary.

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:28.920
It was simply she's
a documentary maker,

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:30.100
and she just wanted to film.

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:33.110
It wasn't a grand scheme of
compiling everything and making

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:34.150
a movie.

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:38.080
She just was interested
in-- she didn't really know.

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:41.372
And it went on for
years and years.

00:29:41.372 --> 00:29:42.830
And I mean like
five years into it,

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:44.538
I forgot that we're
even doing something.

00:29:44.538 --> 00:29:47.550
I was just-- that's Sally.

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:49.460
She's filming.

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:52.130
One day she'll do something
with the 500 hours of footage

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:53.260
she has.

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:55.301
Ava and her classmates
talk about the fives years

00:29:55.301 --> 00:29:56.640
compiled it into a movie.

00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:02.790
And HBO saw it as
a pre-screening

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:03.900
and bought it and sold it.

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:06.010
So we didn't start
out-- and there

00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:09.100
was no plan to say this
is going to be on TV,

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:11.300
and we want to be
famous or none of that,

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:15.910
which is very different
from Food TV, so you speak.

00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:19.330
And I don't strive
for that personally.

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:20.836
So I think there's
a balance there.

00:30:20.836 --> 00:30:21.710
There's a difference.

00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:24.460
Again, we made a movie,
and it was really

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:28.120
a story about a young
person in a big city--

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:32.440
and it could be someone who's
in any industry, especially

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:36.301
any creative industry, artist or
musician or actor or whatever--

00:30:36.301 --> 00:30:38.800
and the trials and tribulations
of just living life and that

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:40.280
was it.

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:42.285
And so it was like
in a narrative.

00:30:42.285 --> 00:30:45.306
I thought they did a
fantastic job on it.

00:30:45.306 --> 00:30:51.840
And I think that it-- I wouldn't
say changed my life at all.

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:55.710
We get recognized a lot,
which is sometimes fun

00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:57.460
and sometimes not.

00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:00.290
But I think more than
that, I'm happy to share

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:02.850
my life and my story
with other people

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:06.540
out there in the world who,
as when we put the movie out,

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:07.650
I find are very similar.

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:09.650
There's a lot of people
out there globally.

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:11.240
And we toured with
the movie-- Europe

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:14.010
and South America and Australia.

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:18.180
And there's a lot of symbiotic
things with other people

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:20.110
other cultures,
other profession.

00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:23.540
They can say, hey, I
thought it was just me.

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:25.550
I'm in that position now.

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:28.180
How do you, and
looking at the film,

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:33.080
help them give them inspiration
to-- maybe, I don't know,

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:35.770
go through the door that they
were not willing to go through.

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:39.450
So for me, that's the
most important part of it.

00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:41.600
And a young chef
that's saw it and said,

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:45.430
you've inspired me to
want to do this and really

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:46.682
do it for a living.

00:31:46.682 --> 00:31:47.890
I was having second thoughts.

00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:49.598
It's a hard business,
that kind of thing.

00:31:49.598 --> 00:31:54.880
And if anything, I think that
is the bigger payoff for me,

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.520
personally.

00:31:56.520 --> 00:32:00.560
I think that's nice,
giving back, you know.

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:04.400
JACI BADZIN: So you have
done a movie, written a book.

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.850
You've been working
in restaurants

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:09.160
since you were 14, 15.

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:12.140
You were a DJ.

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:14.480
What could possibly be next?

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:16.370
What is next?

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:18.990
PAUL LIEBRANDT:
Well, I'm training

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:20.722
to be an amateur
barber, actually.

00:32:20.722 --> 00:32:21.555
JACI BADZIN: Really.

00:32:21.555 --> 00:32:23.055
PAUL LIEBRANDT: No,
I'm [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:23.055 --> 00:32:24.260
I'm just joking.

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:26.532
JACI BADZIN: I was
like, naturally.

00:32:26.532 --> 00:32:28.990
And you're going to spin the
music in your barber shop too.

00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:31.460
PAUL LIEBRANDT: I know,
whilst frying some eggs.

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:35.670
You know, look,
ultimately, I'm a chef.

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:38.180
I'm a cook is the
way I view myself.

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:42.270
I get a thrill every
day when I-- and I have

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:45.410
my guys here and my girls
there, and they'll tell you,

00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:48.100
I get that thrill of
walking in and standing next

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:51.040
to them, and the touch, the
taste, the feel and cooking

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:54.790
and in seeing the plate go out
and looking at the customer

00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:57.870
and seeing their reaction and
the emotion in that first taste

00:32:57.870 --> 00:33:01.085
and the smell and the smile,
and that kind of sit back

00:33:01.085 --> 00:33:01.710
and they think.

00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:03.540
And then you see it.

00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:07.700
You see it when you feed someone
and the joy you can bring.

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:10.404
That is my goal is to
continue doing that,

00:33:10.404 --> 00:33:12.070
because that's the
business that I'm in.

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.150
If the barber thing
takes off, I don't know.

00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:22.350
But I think ultimately,
I'm a cook at heart.

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:24.940
I'm just a cook.

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:27.000
JACI BADZIN: Well, a
very skilled and amazing

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.204
artistically-crafted
cook at that.

00:33:30.204 --> 00:33:32.120
So I've just got a couple
more questions here.

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:35.930
And we're going to open it up
for Q&amp;A just a couple minutes,

00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:37.320
and there's mics
in the audience.

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.820
Anybody have any questions?

00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:42.810
So I like to wrap
up these interviews

00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:47.630
with a "finish this
sentence" style of approach.

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:49.365
So I've got a
couple here for you.

00:33:49.365 --> 00:33:50.440
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Please.

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:53.030
JACI BADZIN: Today is
Abraham Lincoln's birthday.

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:55.170
If you were to cook
him a birthday dinner,

00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:56.496
what would it be?

00:33:56.496 --> 00:33:58.996
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Well, it would
have to be something British,

00:33:58.996 --> 00:33:59.870
wouldn't it?

00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:02.462
Maybe like a revolutionary
hot pot or somebody like that.

00:34:02.462 --> 00:34:03.662
JACI BADZIN: I like that.

00:34:03.662 --> 00:34:05.120
PAUL LIEBRANDT: A
red coat hot pot.

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.453
JACI BADZIN: A red coat hot pot.

00:34:06.453 --> 00:34:07.530
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Yeah.

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:09.730
JACI BADZIN: I think
you should do it.

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:13.530
The bank or music that best
represents your food is?

00:34:16.927 --> 00:34:17.760
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Two.

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:19.810
Nine Inch Nails, The Cure.

00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:21.270
JACI BADZIN: Nice.

00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:23.917
Your favorite American food is?

00:34:23.917 --> 00:34:25.125
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Lobster roll.

00:34:25.125 --> 00:34:26.020
JACI BADZIN: Oh,
that's a good one.

00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:27.019
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Oh yeah.

00:34:27.019 --> 00:34:27.969
A warm lobster roll?

00:34:27.969 --> 00:34:29.260
JACI BADZIN: You like the warm?

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:30.310
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Oh, yeah.

00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:31.500
JACI BADZIN: I like them both.

00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:33.791
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Slightly
toasted, little bit of butter,

00:34:33.791 --> 00:34:38.110
soft bun, sweet, slightly briny
lobster fresh out of the ocean,

00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:39.110
little bit of mayo-- oh!

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:40.485
JACI BADZIN: You're
really making

00:34:40.485 --> 00:34:41.866
me want a lobster
roll right now.

00:34:41.866 --> 00:34:42.852
PAUL LIEBRANDT: I'm
leaving, I'm leaving.

00:34:42.852 --> 00:34:43.840
That's it.

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:45.030
JACI BADZIN: Let's book
over to Chelsea Market.

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:45.390
PAUL LIEBRANDT: I'm going
to go to that lobster

00:34:45.390 --> 00:34:46.520
place in Chelsea Market.

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:48.840
JACI BADZIN: Exactly.

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:51.830
Your favorite DJ is?

00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:54.115
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Carl Cox,
DJ Hype, two of them.

00:34:54.115 --> 00:34:54.540
JACI BADZIN: Yes, so good.

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:57.130
PAUL LIEBRANDT: That's like
very old school British DJs.

00:34:57.130 --> 00:34:58.150
JACI BADZIN: So good.

00:34:58.150 --> 00:34:59.440
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Very good.

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:02.330
JACI BADZIN: Your favorite
type of cuisine to eat?

00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:03.580
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Japanese food.

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:08.260
JACI BADZIN: What is
your favorite restaurant

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:10.004
that people should know about?

00:35:10.004 --> 00:35:11.920
PAUL LIEBRANDT: That
people should know about.

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:13.662
JACI BADZIN: That you're
willing to let people in on.

00:35:13.662 --> 00:35:14.495
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Hmm.

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:18.410
Anywhere globally or just--?

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:19.310
JACI BADZIN: Sure.

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:19.570
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Globally.

00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:20.020
JACI BADZIN: Globally.

00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:22.590
If it's going to be on
YouTube, let's let people know.

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:23.940
PAUL LIEBRANDT: I see.

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:29.480
OK, well, I think
personally, because it

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:33.044
has such a big impact with
me, Pierre Gagnaire in Paris.

00:35:33.044 --> 00:35:33.960
JACI BADZIN: Gagnaire.

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:36.720
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Pierre--
thank you-- Pierre Gagnaire

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:41.940
because that man redefined the
way I think about what I do.

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:44.600
So I would say for me
that's closest to my heart.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:45.779
Magic, real magic.

00:35:45.779 --> 00:35:47.320
JACI BADZIN: Is
there a specific dish

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.150
that people should get there?

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:49.286
PAUL LIEBRANDT: No, it
changes all the time.

00:35:49.286 --> 00:35:50.570
JACI BADZIN: OK.

00:35:50.570 --> 00:35:53.440
I'm adding that to my list
of places to eat when I got.

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:55.670
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Please.

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:59.040
JACI BADZIN: And the last
question is let's say,

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:01.616
you've just finished
a grueling day.

00:36:01.616 --> 00:36:03.430
You're tired, you're exhausted.

00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:05.170
What do you eat at
the end of the shift?

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:07.270
And what do you drink
more importantly?

00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:09.410
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Drink water.

00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:10.320
JACI BADZIN: Water?

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.760
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Water.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:18.210
And I would say to
eat, I like sushi.

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:21.090
Yeah, sashimi and sushi at
1 o'clock in the morning

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:23.520
is the perfect time.

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:24.940
It really is.

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:27.300
JACI BADZIN: That's
good to know.

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:28.300
Well, thank you so much.

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:31.360
If anybody has any questions,
we're going to open it.

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:32.489
I think you're up.

00:36:32.489 --> 00:36:33.030
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:35.310
First I want to say thank you.

00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:39.030
The Elm was somewhere in my top
four favor meals of last year.

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:40.987
It's really difficult
to actually order those,

00:36:40.987 --> 00:36:43.570
but it was absolutely wonderful,
and I hope to come back soon.

00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:45.430
PAUL LIEBRANDT:
Thank you very much.

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:46.820
AUDIENCE: And normally,
every chef that comes here,

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:47.950
I ask them whether
or not they consider

00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:49.592
themselves a craftsman
or an artist?

00:36:49.592 --> 00:36:50.800
But you've already took that.

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:54.010
So my back-up question is what
is your favorite ingredient

00:36:54.010 --> 00:36:55.890
that you don't get
to use often, either

00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:58.170
whether it's because the
general public dislikes it,

00:36:58.170 --> 00:36:59.685
it's scarce, it's too expensive?

00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:07.260
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Personally
speaking, I think,

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:10.910
shellfish and fish for me
are my favorite ingredients

00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:11.580
to work with.

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:20.540
And of that, I would say there's
a species of lobster called

00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:24.940
a cigar de mer, which is not a
very widely used lobster, which

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:26.840
you get from the Mediterranean.

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:29.360
And it's a known as
a slipper lobster.

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:32.070
It's very expensive,
very seasonal.

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:35.230
I only ever used it in
France at Pierre Gagnaire.

00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:38.300
And it's a very rare
item, but the flavor

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:39.870
is like eating vanilla.

00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:41.920
It's stunning.

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:43.480
So that would be one of them.

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:44.428
Yes.

00:37:44.428 --> 00:37:46.800
JACI BADZIN: Nice.

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:48.754
Well, thank you so much,
Chef, for coming in.

00:37:48.754 --> 00:37:49.920
PAUL LIEBRANDT: My pleasure.

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:51.590
JACI BADZIN: It was such a
pleasure to have you here.

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:52.673
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Thank you.

00:37:52.673 --> 00:37:54.470
JACI BADZIN: And I want to--

00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:57.690
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:57.690 --> 00:38:00.710
JACI BADZIN: Chef has agreed
to sign some books at the end.

00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:02.950
So you guys are
welcome to come up,

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:05.570
and we'll conclude the speech.

00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:07.450
PAUL LIEBRANDT:
Thank you very much.
