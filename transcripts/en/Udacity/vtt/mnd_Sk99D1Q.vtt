00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.820
Okay, so here I am, at the original
design of the class Movie,

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.730
to figure out the next thing
we have to do with our code.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.860
So thus far, what we have done
is define the class Movie and

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.160
taken care of all of the instance
variables we want to remember.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.180
We also designed a couple of
instances of the class Movie,

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.450
namely Toy Story and Avatar.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.540
The one thing we still haven't done is
define this function show_trailer().

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.640
Now, this function as its name suggests,
will open a browser and

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.680
play the trailer of a movie.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.720
So essentially,

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.540
what we want to do is run a line of
code like this: avatar.show_trailer().

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.840
And when that runs, we want it to
play the trailer of the movie Avatar.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.070
By the way, a function that
is defined inside a class and

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.230
is associated with an instance
is called an instance method.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.200
That is another new word for our list.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.710
More on these new vocabulary words soon.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.120
First, let's define show_trailer().
