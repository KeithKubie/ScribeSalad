From the library of Congress in Washington DC

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.090
You know I was just I was up early this morning and wandering around the city and just

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.180
being amazed once again about what a beautiful and impressive city it is and

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:26.559
Just hoping that we can all get together and start doing beautiful and impressive things here in terms of our representatives

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.840
I'm trying

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.079
there's nothing more important to me than then the books that I write for kids young people ETC and

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:37.449
And the reason I write these books

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.839
The reason I came here even though I'm going to talk mysteries later on but [I] didn't come for that is

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.630
That I think the best way to get kids reading is given them books. They'll love it's kind of common sense

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.690
and

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:53.870
I

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.870
I don't think it happens

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.779
enough in [in] some of the schools

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.148
And I don't think it happens enough in a lot of our homes. I have a friend good friend

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.719
who

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:10.538
His wife died he wound up racing is the two boys and they really turned out great

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.699
But it never occurred to him that it was his [job] to

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.499
Go out and and find books for his boys that they would love

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:25.898
I was not a big reader as a kid although. I was a very good student

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.649
The school's I went to I guess with [the] wrong books in our hands in my hands anyway

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:35.559
I still don't like silas Marner

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:41.859
I have an 11 year old jack and Jack. It didn't particularly like to read though

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:45.428
He was a good student as well. Jack is is is very bright and creative

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:50.888
He's 11 now at five year oat an illustrated book called death of the butterfly catcher

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:58.689
Butterfly Catcher gets on a plane travel temper [around] the world doesn't catch a butterfly gets on a boat travels

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:00.689
You only half of the world doesn't catch a butterfly

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:05.589
Gets on a train when Jack was five. He loved trains catches the butterfly

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:09.309
Steps off the train gets hit by a train going the other way

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.039
death of the Butterfly catcher

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.380
butterfly flies away

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.290
but as

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.290
Smart as he as he as he kind of is he didn't real

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.129
Like to read that much so my wife sue and what we did is when he was 8

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:32.859
we went out and found about a dozen books that we thought he would like Percy Jackson and Hatchet and the warrior Series ETC and

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.499
We told Jack you don't have to mow [the] lawn

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.569
but you do have to read every day for at least half an hour as much as you want to and

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.439
the first summer Jack's response was do I have to and

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.540
Then we did the same thing the second summer and Jack's response that summer was okay. That's fine

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.220
By the third summer Jack were at a dozen books including to kill a mockingbird

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.370
when he was 10, and this past summer he read God knows how many books including huckleberry finn and

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.260
The secret for us is soo suan eyes. We made it our responsibility

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.189
To find books that we knew he was going to love

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.859
About a year ago a year and a half ago. I started a website to help

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.150
Not to try to teach people or lecture to [Livermore]

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:25.089
Whatever. It was just to help parents and grandparents and school librarians and teachers and kids

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.450
To find books that would turn them on

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.719
On this site. It's called Read kiddo read calm and on that site

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.630
There's nothing but kind of books that are going to turn kids on

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:44.499
That are also fairly well worthwhile they're divided into you know one to six year olds and then

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.219
transitional books and then page Turners and then books that are harder, but worth the effort and

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.339
I've done a bunch of interviews on the site with Jeff Kinney and Rick Riordan and Julie Andrews

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.190
John Jessica, who I just met here. Who's a terrific? I sherman Alexie [carl], hiaasen

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.339
And finally I I I'm writing books for kids a lot of a maximum ride is one series

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:17.888
It's about some kids with Wings

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.769
but what it's really about is kids taking responsibility for their actions and

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.689
And learning to be responsible for one another that's that's what I think it's about

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.490
There is a movie coming and and I think the people who are involved with it are

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:40.329
Are really first-rate avI arad is producing an avI produced Spider-Man and x-Men and iron man

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.759
[and] he really cares about doing these things well

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.979
they have a script from don Payne who was the head writer on the simpsons for eight years and

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:54.219
He's really a funny and good writer. I think the script is great and then Catherine hardwicke who?

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:02.320
Directed Twilight is directing it so it's a really really good group, and I have the highest hopes for the movie

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.649
Which of course is very visual because there's a lot of flying in it?

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.329
the second series which you may not be as familiar with is called Daniel x and

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.430
Daniel has the greatest superpower of all which is he can create with his imagination

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:24.429
so that series is really about using [your] imagination to overcome impossible odds and

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:28.509
girls Like Daniel but but boys Love Daniel and

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.139
That's the hardest thing of all I think to write a series

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.989
That boys will love obviously Jeff Kenny's done a great job with that with Wimpy Kid

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.229
and that's what I tried to do with with Daniel x

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:47.229
My son Jack gave me the highest praise when he said dad you finally got one right?

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:55.150
About daniel x and then because I'm a busy bee in a nut case. I have witch in Wizard coming out in the fall and

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:01.329
Once again this the idea for that I find kind of irresistible which is imagine if you woke up one morning

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:06.970
And all the freedoms you took for granted all the things you really loved music art

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.329
Books movies were but she is so good

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.030
Because I talk fast man

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.550
that's what happens to the brother and sister who are the main characters in witch in Wizard and

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.220
Who happened to be a witch in Wizard?

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:28.170
So who has questions, and I don't have answers, but I can fake it

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:35.280
Yes, but I will do it right go ahead. We don't have time. We're too fast for that

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.870
Question is am I going to continue the maximum ride series?

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:51.039
Yeah, as I said Jack is 11, and he grows out of his shoes real fast

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.980
Oh, I got to keep ya maximum ride will keep going on for a while

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.099
I think I know where it ends, but I'm not sure

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:58.790
Yeah

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:00.710
What color is Max's hair?

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:07.569
What color is Matt because it changes what she changes the lies you know she dyes her hair she's kind of a contemporary girl

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:13.569
It's been blonde. It's ben brown. It's been read. I'd say what color do you want it to be?

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:16.970
Yeah

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:22.869
Um what's your favorite maximum ride book? What's my favorite maximum ride book? I you know that's hard for me

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:31.150
I'm always partial to the first one because it's new and it was hard and so I love the angel experiment. I really like Max

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:38.349
The last one and I you know I the next one that I that that I just finished is I think is pretty good

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:40.350
Too, what do you want?

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.369
Um who's playing Max in the movie who's Gonna Play [Maxon] movie?

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:50.679
We don't know yet from what I understand and this is in gospel, but I not for Max

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.419
But I think nudge might be will Smith's daughter. I think yeah cool

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:59.650
I jumped out that don't take that one to the but I that's the rumor yeah

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:04.659
What is the maximum you like soccer coming out? Yes? Yeah, let me ask you a question

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:08.320
Are you better now, or when you were like five?

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:14.229
You're better when you were five, but that throws that thing out okay? What's your question?

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:19.270
Oh, when is the maximum ride movie coming out when is the Maximum ride movie coming out?

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:20.450
I'm not sure

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:24.789
It's complicated because there are a lot of special effects because they have so far

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:28.119
They haven't been been able to find any kids who actually fly yeah

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:32.200
Matts you can get in trouble down here. You spoke nationally

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:37.030
She's supposed to wear go ahead one spired you to write Maximum ride. What inspired me um

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:41.590
I've always been you know look I want to lift off. You know

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:49.059
I we have these feet of clay and so that's always interested me the notion of flying the notion of being able to rise above

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:53.320
The limitations that we have as human beings. I think that's a piece of it yep

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.459
What tips would you get to aspiring writer um?

00:08:58.309 --> 00:09:01.358
What it would advise we get to it to aspiring Writers I?

00:09:02.839 --> 00:09:05.318
Just keep doing it over and over and over again

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:12.299
when you finish, whatever whether it's a short story or

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:14.200
novel

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:18.239
Don't just sit down and write the next one just keep doing it you'll keep getting better

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.299
It's like anything else except for that one guy in soccer

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:29.310
Yeah, can we expect a daniel x movie when do I expected Daniel x movie? I don't know the guy who did

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:32.020
and

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:35.639
The trucks it turn into monsters. Whatever he did the producer

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:42.840
Transformers he's messing around with it. I tard to say with Hollywood because they they sort of make up stuff

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:46.620
Yeah, I'm not sure is the answer yep. What inspired you to become a writer?

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:49.170
What inspired me to become a writer ah?

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:51.550
let's see I

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:55.109
As I said I wasn't a huge writer as a kid a reader as a kid

00:09:55.110 --> 00:10:00.270
And I worked my way through college at a mental hospital, and I worked a lot of night shifts

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:01.560
And I had a lot of free time

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:02.970
I started reading like crazy

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:05.010
And then I started scribbling

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:09.840
and I loved it and somebody said you're lucky if you find something you love and

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:15.210
Then it's a miracle if somebody will pay you to do it, so I love doing it. I do it every day

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:19.289
I did it before I came here in the morning, and it's just a trip for me

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:23.580
Yeah, how'd you choose to write about bird people? How did I write about bird people?

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:26.699
How did you choose to write about them instead of a different I?

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.369
said part of it was just a fascination with

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:36.210
With flying and actually my family to my sisters have wings and can fly so that got me going on it

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:37.960
football

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:42.299
Um how'd you get the idea of writing Daniel x?

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:48.839
how did I get the idea of writing Daniel x um I guess I just liked [the] idea of

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:55.379
somebody who could solve problems with their imagination that was part of it, then I like the idea of

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.909
This kid who's there? And he's hunting aliens on the earth you probably don't know that

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:04.500
They're aliens all over the place, but there are you probably met a few and didn't know it. Yeah

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:06.990
Have you ever thought of anything where?

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.050
the Maximum Ride characters and the Daniel

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:14.890
Have interaction have I ever thought of combining two Daniel, Lexington Maximum ride

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.560
The trick is Hollywood

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.009
When you sell something there they go, oh

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:26.679
If adding anything that shows up at a maximum ride book we own now. So you have to be care

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:27.340
I did the same thing

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.230
I initially I do mysteries

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:33.880
And I was going to put the woman to murder club and an [alex] [cross] thing and they said oh if you do that well

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.840
On the woman's murder club, so you wind up not being able to do which is kind of crazy. Yeah

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:43.150
What did you think of the maximum ride manga book that came out? What did I [think] of the manga?

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:46.269
I thought it was pretty cool. I thought it was pretty the manga book

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:52.150
I thought they did a nice job without the drawings were very good. I think she's really talented the second one

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:53.810
I think is coming out

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:56.109
Soon do you know I'm not sure?

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:58.810
Yeah, I

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:03.999
[proved] yeah, what's your favorite children's book? What's my favorite children's book?

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.020
I

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:11.350
Don't know I use a lot of them. I lay a wrinkle in time

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:19.239
I yeah, there's just times. I like their reardon's that the percy stuff. I like

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:22.510
Wimpy kid I like

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:29.379
Well, I mean to kill a mockingbird is in the children's book but but it I think it's a book at a certain point

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:34.300
Which is which is one of my favorites for I think I read it when I was 12 or 13

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:40.270
Yeah, did you do a lot of research when you were coming up with the burgh kids. I did yes, I did

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:42.270
I wrote an adult novel

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:47.469
initially with with a flying girl and I talked to

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:51.009
Just so many scientists about the possibilities

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:53.680
And they all said that not that

00:12:53.960 --> 00:13:00.670
But things like that will happen in our lifetime with because of the advancements in the and what can what can happen with biotech?

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:04.660
Yeah, this side is a this is a better side. I'm telling you manic moves

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:05.650
Yeah

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:09.819
Who's your favorite author when you were kid pardon me who was your favorite author when you were a kid?

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:12.130
Who's my favorite author when I was a kid?

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:23.529

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.120
Hollister

00:14:57.810 --> 00:14:59.899
Hollister California is open for

You've been warned. What was my inspiration for you've been warned. Oh, you've been warned

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.920
a little bit of Catholic childhood

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:22.099
Scary stuff about hell things like that

He's working anymore ability that the guy that played edward and the guy that played bella are going to be max and fang

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:44.269
Is there any possibility that the characters from Twilight the two main characters will be max and fang I doubt it

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:48.740
I think there's been a little bit of talk about the guy who played Edward being fag

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:53.329
I'm not this isn't my talk I no yes no no

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.890
Yes

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:57.890
No, I it's not in our control

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:01.579
Hollywood just does what they do. They don't bury

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:06.050
They and I must say avi the producer has been terrific

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:10.219
he does involve me more than I've been involved in the past but

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:16.189
I have a lot of funny Hollywood stories this isn't the place yeah too much cursing

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:20.420
Crying weeping yeah is Iggy ever going to get his sight back

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.500
Is Iggy ever going to get a sight back? Well? He's had flashes now

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:30.649
He's seeing a little bit more which I don't stan but I take his word for it. Yeah

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:36.829
My son Jackson is a huge fan and he's read all your books and a lot of the other popular books out right now I?

00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:39.169
Was thinking to call him my son Jack Jackson

00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:44.299
But then I go Jackson Patterson sounds like a receiver for the Oakland Raiders or something so I?

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:45.260
Yeah

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:49.309
Uh do you have a recommendation you mentioned your son reading to kill a mockingbird?

00:16:49.769 --> 00:16:53.989
When it's appropriate for that next level of reading. I think people need to figure that out for themselves

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:57.529
I mean, you know your kids, and you got to figure out when they're ready and

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:04.969
Jack was he's you know he's systems very sophisticated now. I don't you know Iii think that parents

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:10.970
I think I do to think one thing that's kind of weird with parents are sometimes is they'll do this age appropriate thing

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:16.548
Or great appropriate its age. I think is the issue and you just need to know your kids

00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:22.369
But they'll send their kids to any freakin movie and then ago is this age appropriate yeah

00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:25.729
Give me a break. Yeah, you know killing gnomes

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:30.799
Thousands of them is as bad as you know somebody dies in a book yeah

00:17:31.049 --> 00:17:35.149
Could you tell something about your process when you write like from the very beginning today?

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.599
Tell something about the process when I write well, okay, this is important

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:43.160
I think for any kids here and and you hear this all the time in school

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:48.619
And you don't listen and I didn't listen when I was your age II other when they say outline outline

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:55.040
Outline Outline Outline outline outline. It makes everything easier. You'll get better grades

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:58.579
It will go faster. It will go faster

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:05.510
You will write a better piece you will get a better grade outline so the first step in terms of my writing is Outline I?

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:10.640
Will spend a long time. I'll rewrite the outline five six seven times for any of the max books

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:16.760
And then I write a lot of drafts. I don't I never get stuck

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.219
I just keep going if I'm not getting a chapter

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:23.510
I just move on and I'll get it the next time around and I and I write a lot of drafts

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:26.599
Confidence, obviously helps say ignatius your back

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:29.000
How long does it take you to write a book?

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.369
I want to take me to write a book usually a year, but I'm but I work on a lot at the same time

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:38.709
Yes, sir. What's your favorite genre? What's my favorite Genre?

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:42.930
geography, no I

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:49.170
Don't you know I like I like a lot of kinds of books as I said I like Michael connelly mystery stuff

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:53.399
I like a lot of the why a books. I'm reading it and I

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:58.769
Like occasionally like a love story. I don't I don't I don't think I have a genre

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:01.740
I don't like war stories too much

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.270
I don't know why but I don't yeah

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:10.650
I just wanted to thank you because your books between the adult and the children books have served as real connection between

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:17.309
My son, st.. Ignatius in his papa how great they really thank you for for bringing that up and

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.640
one of the reasons

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:28.289
One of the reasons that I started writing for younger people although a lot of adults read the books as well is

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:30.190
I

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:36.899
Would come to signings and people would come up and and go you got my kid reading and a lot of times

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:42.120
they'd have tears in her eyes because it's a huge deal for a lot of parents if the kids aren't reading it really is a

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:45.929
It's a big deal and just go back to what I said before, but if you're having a problem

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:49.259
You got to find books that they're going to like and that doesn't mean

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:56.130
You know my kid likes baseball there for a baseball book if it's a baseball book you got to find a good one

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:59.820
It's got to be stuff where they're getting that's why I'm read kiddo read

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:07.110
We're I've tried to make sure that all the books there are good ones, and there's write-ups not not critiques, but right up

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:11.999
So you can tell what the books are about and it will take you about five minutes to decide whether the site is for you

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.400
Or not yet. When's the next maximum ride book coming next maximum Ride book. I believe is March

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:21.509
Yeah, could you just take a few minutes to explain?

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:24.030
How you broke into publishing and sold your first manuscript?

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:27.509
Could I take a few minutes to in terms of how I broke into publishing

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:32.009
Okay, interesting for anybody who writes books and wants to write books

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.610
I wrote the first novel when I was

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:41.370
25 or 26 at Thomas Barrowman number it got turned down by 31 publishers

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:47.130
It then won an edgar is the best American first first American mystery of the year

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:50.280
So if you get turned down don't worry about it

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:54.779
Because you might have written a good book and they said before go write another one

00:20:56.169 --> 00:20:59.638
but the other thing about about turndowns is I

00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:06.538
Remember in the beginning you would get back you know 20 or so letters everyone would have a different point of view

00:21:07.179 --> 00:21:09.719
so they're all thinking different things and

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:14.370
but don't worry about it and keep writing if you love to do it yep is the witch in Wizard Book and

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:16.570
Going to be part of a series

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:18.899
The ways in which wish it was Adam

00:21:20.139 --> 00:21:23.819
Is the witch and Wizard book going to be part of a series? Yes?

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:26.580
I'm already

00:21:26.619 --> 00:21:29.639
Two thirds of the way through the second book yeah

00:21:30.669 --> 00:21:32.969
Do you base your character is off anyone you know?

00:21:33.279 --> 00:21:38.189
as I [said] might the two sisters of mine who have wings the question was do I yeah uh

00:21:40.509 --> 00:21:42.190
Mostly no

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:43.419
No

00:21:43.419 --> 00:21:47.579
Yeah, so can you tell us anything about the next Maximum Ride book?

00:21:48.159 --> 00:21:52.439
Can I tell you anything about the next Maximum Ride book?

00:21:54.519 --> 00:21:57.329
Yeah, fang and Max are

00:21:58.929 --> 00:22:02.668
really like each other, but they get pulled apart and

00:22:03.879 --> 00:22:05.679
Angel has

00:22:05.679 --> 00:22:12.778
Said that fang will be the first one to die an angel is never wrong, but we hope she's wrong this time

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:16.350
How's that? Yeah? What impact?

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:25.889
You guys stay up at the mic because I what impact do you expect your books to have one kids?

00:22:27.429 --> 00:22:29.579
On kids, uh-huh?

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:36.149
What impact do I hope do [I] [helped] my books will have my kids I?

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:42.329
hope and this is why I did this that obviously I write books that are very popular and

00:22:42.879 --> 00:22:44.879
My hope is that

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:49.259
Look [there] million to kitchen in this country who have never read a book they liked that

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:51.519
is a disaster

00:22:51.519 --> 00:22:56.489
Because that means that they're not going to read much. I mean if you go through life

00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:59.369
You know anything that you don't you don't like broccoli? You don't eat broccoli

00:22:59.369 --> 00:23:03.239
You know so if you've had bad experiences with books it's not a good thing

00:23:03.369 --> 00:23:09.659
So I'm hoping that my books will give kids good experiences with with books. They will then read other books

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:12.809
And they'll continue to deal for the rest of their lives

00:23:12.809 --> 00:23:17.849
And it will be in different levels as I said you know I like Michael connelly I like

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:23.999
Young adult books I like James joyce so my reading love my reading of books is at different levels

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:31.140
And I hope that's what happened to to a lot of kids because of their having experienced some of my books yeah

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:32.950
I

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:35.400
Love all the adult books you're in which one is your favorite?

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:40.919
Out of all the adult books I've written which ones are my favorites. I you know I'm I'm I'm

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:44.220
Happy that I created alex cross as a character

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:51.480
Michael Bennett whose it that's another series. I have I really love him as a character. I don't know that

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:57.630
I have you know I like Susanna's diary for Nicholas. Which was a love story. They really are a lot a honeymoon

00:23:57.630 --> 00:23:59.939
I think is a really good mystery. So there I

00:24:01.059 --> 00:24:03.059
Don't like season the machete at all

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:05.820
So I it's a mixed bag no

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:11.460
I don't have any favorite favorite I do a season of machetes definitely what I dislike the most yeah um

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:13.949
What's your favorite series that you've written?

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:17.070
Yes, I was just saying

00:24:18.309 --> 00:24:19.990
I

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:26.400
There a lot about me in this I can't really pick even in this grouping maximum ride

00:24:26.919 --> 00:24:29.219
Daniel axe witch and Wizard, they're all very different

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:32.309
I'm happy with the way they're going

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:40.079
And I I'm actually doing a book now to book series about Middle school, and it's really juicy

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:44.880
I'll tell you yeah, yeah, I noticed that such as you know. What goes on there now

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:49.439
The world is going to know yeah some of your adult novels you have cold Riders or partners

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:55.710
Yeah, why do you want to be a co-writer? Maybe sure why not? How do you choose are they really you ready the

00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:59.339
We're gonna alternate words. Why?

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:05.189
Are you just trying to help other riders? Are they really helping you or what's that? Oh, I I got it

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:11.700
I got into the co-writing thing by accident a friend of mine writes a lot articles for the New York times and we were out

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.129
Golfing one day, and we sat down

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:19.409
Afterwards and then we were talking and I de scoffs to and I started talking about it

00:25:19.409 --> 00:25:23.279
And I said let's try to write it together. It was really a lot of fun and

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:27.660
What I won, I could never write all the stories. I have in my head

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:33.689
I just thought wouldn't have the time to do it and I find with the co-writers that

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:41.669
and you know almost all television shows not all you know I written like teams a lot of movies are and

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:46.980
You wind up getting a nice mix of talents, and you know my strength is storytelling?

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:52.740
my weakness is the patients with with craft, so

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:59.939
You know I'm not the greatest stylist in the world. I could be better if I if I wrote one book a year

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:05.880
So it's a nice mix for me all right. [thank] you. Yeah

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:10.439
How do you feel about being included in the poker game on castle?

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:14.849
How did I feel about being in a poker game and castle? It was great. It was a lot of fun

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:19.709
I thought it came off nicely. They did a nice job. They cut nice pieces of me in there

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:22.829
This is a TV show that I was in but inviting me back

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:26.939
But I say, it's just too hard for me to go all the way out

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:30.090
It's three days and you know so I didn't go back, but I really enjoyed it

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:30.990
And I think it's a good show

00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:36.299
It's a good writer that put it together yep, what is the ambience of when you write your surrounding?

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:38.490
What's the ambience of when I right?

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:41.080
There's angels

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:44.069
and fly um I

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:47.880
Aren't all over the place now. I i have been all well

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:52.229
I'll tell you what I mean my office, it's it's sort of big it looks out on the water

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:56.010
And I have a table that goes not a table

00:26:56.010 --> 00:27:01.260
but a shelf that goes all the way around their bookshelves on top and a shelter goes all the way around the room and

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:08.130
It's filled with manuscripts things that I'm working on outlines and right now. They're 27 so it's in Madhouse

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:10.530
I said I was a nutcase earlier, and I'm not kidding

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:16.589
Yeah, it's Casanova coming back, and we'll cross captures Captain over coming back, and we'll cross catch him I

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:18.880
Didn't he die?

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:22.920
Didn't I I don't know yeah? Do you know I would have you seen him

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:27.719
I yeah, I thought he was dead, but maybe not okay. I will say maybe

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:34.200
Yeah, how many books have you wrote? [I] don't know how many books have I written?

00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:39.209
60 maybe how many of you written?

00:27:40.809 --> 00:27:43.649
nine yet one is for A

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.559
Few pages all right, okay?

00:27:46.559 --> 00:27:51.928
Well that's how it starts if you write a page a day at the end of the year you'll have a book

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:58.739
Yeah, so how did you feel when you looked at the check for movie rights for your book?

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:01.170
How do I feel when I look at the checks?

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:03.450
for the movie rights to my book

00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:06.630
You know it's still one. It's fun

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:12.449
To it remains kind of unreal to me, and that's probably why it's fun

00:28:13.059 --> 00:28:19.709
We have a choice more [parts] unreal, huh? We love that. You're getting rewarded. Yeah that way title I

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:26.939
It was always fun. It was fun when I wasn't making anything it was fun when I wasn't fun to be turned down initially

00:28:28.179 --> 00:28:30.209
But it was it's always been fun to write the books

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:32.880
Are we good?

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:35.730
