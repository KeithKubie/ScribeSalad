00:00:06.762 --> 00:00:11.233
Aristotle famously said,
"Nature fears of empty space"

00:00:11.233 --> 00:00:16.017
when he claimed that a true vacuum, 
a space devoid of matter, could not exist

00:00:16.017 --> 00:00:19.105
because the surrounding matter
would immediately fill it.

00:00:19.105 --> 00:00:21.994
Fortunately, he turned out to be wrong.

00:00:21.994 --> 00:00:25.010
A vacuum is a key component
of the barometer,

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.492
an instrument for measuring air pressure.

00:00:27.492 --> 00:00:30.107
And because air pressure 
correlates to temperature

00:00:30.107 --> 00:00:32.032
and rapid shifts in it can contribute to

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:35.643
hurricanes, tornadoes 
and other extreme weather events,

00:00:35.643 --> 00:00:38.156
a barometer is one of the
most essential tools 

00:00:38.156 --> 00:00:41.840
for weather forecasters and scientists alike.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.766
How does a barometer work,
and how was it invented?

00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:46.448
Well, it took awhile.

00:00:46.448 --> 00:00:49.741
Because the theory of Aristotle 
and other ancient philosophers

00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:54.986
regarding the impossibility of a vacuum
seemed to hold true in everyday life,

00:00:54.986 --> 00:00:59.040
few seriously thought to question it
for nearly 2,000 years --

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.541
until necessity raised the issue.

00:01:01.541 --> 00:01:05.550
In the early 17th century,
Italian miners faced a serious problem

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.442
when they found that their pumps
could not raise water 

00:01:08.442 --> 00:01:10.822
more than 10.3 meters high.

00:01:10.822 --> 00:01:14.883
Some scientists at the time,
including one Galileo Galilei,

00:01:14.883 --> 00:01:20.310
proposed that sucking air out of the pipe
was what made water rise to replace the void.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.606
But that its force was limited and could lift
no more than 10.3 meters of water.

00:01:25.606 --> 00:01:28.523
However, the idea of a 
vacuum existing at all

00:01:28.523 --> 00:01:30.728
was still considered controversial.

00:01:30.728 --> 00:01:33.647
And the excitement over 
Galileo's unorthodox theory,

00:01:33.647 --> 00:01:38.231
led Gasparo Berti to conduct a simple
but brilliant experiment

00:01:38.231 --> 00:01:40.213
to demonstrate that it was possible.

00:01:40.213 --> 00:01:42.402
A long tube was filled with water

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:46.321
and placed standing in a shallow pool 
with both ends plugged.

00:01:46.321 --> 00:01:48.948
The bottom end of the tube 
was then opened

00:01:48.948 --> 00:01:51.429
and water poured out into the basin

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:56.096
until the level of the water remaining 
in the tube was 10.3 meters.

00:01:56.096 --> 00:02:00.017
With a gap remaining at the top,
and no air having entered the tube,

00:02:00.017 --> 00:02:04.401
Berti had succeeded in
directly creating a stable vacuum.

00:02:04.401 --> 00:02:08.497
But even though the possibility 
of a vacuum had been demonstrated,

00:02:08.497 --> 00:02:11.411
not everyone was satisfied 
with Galileo's idea

00:02:11.411 --> 00:02:14.463
that this empty void 
was exerting some mysterious

00:02:14.463 --> 00:02:16.943
yet finite force on the water.

00:02:16.943 --> 00:02:20.973
Evangelista Torricelli, 
Galileo's young pupil and friend,

00:02:20.973 --> 00:02:23.676
decided to look at the problem
from a different angle.

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:27.017
Instead of focusing on the 
empty space inside the tube,

00:02:27.017 --> 00:02:30.390
he asked himself,
"What else could be influencing the water?"

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.328
Because the only thing in contact 
with the water was the air surrounding the pool,

00:02:34.328 --> 00:02:38.159
he believed the pressure from this air
could be the only thing preventing

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:41.247
the water level in the tube
from dropping further.

00:02:41.247 --> 00:02:45.151
He realized that the experiment 
was not only a tool to create a vacuum,

00:02:45.151 --> 00:02:47.288
but operated as a balance

00:02:47.288 --> 00:02:50.681
between the atmospheric pressure
on the water outside the tube

00:02:50.681 --> 00:02:53.895
and the pressure from the
water column inside the tube.

00:02:53.895 --> 00:02:58.534
The water level in the tube decreases
until the two pressures are equal,

00:02:58.534 --> 00:03:02.342
which just happens to be
when the water is at 10.3 meters.

00:03:02.342 --> 00:03:04.655
This idea was not easily accepted,

00:03:04.655 --> 00:03:07.553
as Galileo and others 
had traditionally thought

00:03:07.553 --> 00:03:12.064
that atmospheric air has no weight
and exerts no pressure.

00:03:12.064 --> 00:03:14.898
Torricelli decided to 
repeat Berti's experiment

00:03:14.898 --> 00:03:16.851
with mercury instead of water.

00:03:16.851 --> 00:03:20.168
Because mercury was denser, 
it fell farther than the water

00:03:20.168 --> 00:03:23.994
and the mercury column stood
only about 76 centimeters tall.

00:03:23.994 --> 00:03:28.245
Not only did this allow Torricelli to make
the instrument much more compact,

00:03:28.245 --> 00:03:32.341
it supported his idea that weight
was the deciding factor.

00:03:32.341 --> 00:03:37.891
A variation on the experiment used two tubes
with one having a large bubble at the top.

00:03:37.891 --> 00:03:42.136
If Galileo's interpretation had been correct,
the bigger vacuum in the second tube

00:03:42.136 --> 00:03:45.805
should have exerted more suction
and lifted the mercury higher.

00:03:45.805 --> 00:03:48.840
But the level in both tubes was the same.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.085
The ultimate support for Torricelli's theory
came via Blaise Pascal

00:03:53.085 --> 00:03:56.308
who had such a mercury tube
taken up a mountain

00:03:56.308 --> 00:03:58.278
and showed that the mercury level dropped

00:03:58.278 --> 00:04:02.031
as the atmospheric pressure
decreased with altitude.

00:04:02.031 --> 00:04:05.451
Mercury barometers based on 
Torricelli's original model

00:04:05.451 --> 00:04:10.366
remained one of the most common ways
to measure atmospheric pressure until 2007

00:04:10.366 --> 00:04:13.623
when restrictions on the use of
mercury due to its toxicity

00:04:13.623 --> 00:04:16.853
led to them no longer
being produced in Europe.

00:04:16.853 --> 00:04:18.932
Nevertheless, Torricelli's invention,

00:04:18.932 --> 00:04:22.076
born of the willingness to question
long accepted dogmas

00:04:22.076 --> 00:04:25.802
about vacuums and the weight of air,
is an outstanding example

00:04:25.802 --> 00:04:29.077
of how thinking outside of the box
-- or the tube --

00:04:29.077 --> 00:04:30.589
can have a heavy impact.
