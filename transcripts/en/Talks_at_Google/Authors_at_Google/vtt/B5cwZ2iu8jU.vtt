00:00:08.157 --> 00:00:09.240
SACHIT EGAN: OK, everyone.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.560
Welcome to Talks at Google.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.690
My name is Sach Egan.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.678
And I'm really excited and
honored to be your host today.

00:00:14.678 --> 00:00:16.219
A lot of folks here
in Mountain View.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:17.300
So thanks for coming out.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.584
Good afternoon to you all.

00:00:18.584 --> 00:00:20.000
I know we've got
a lot of Googlers

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.291
tuning in around the country
and even around the world.

00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:24.046
So good day to you as well.

00:00:24.046 --> 00:00:25.670
I'll introduce Dr.
Hanscom in a minute.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.336
But first I'll just
begin by telling you

00:00:27.336 --> 00:00:29.893
that, like many folks in this
room, I suffer from back pain.

00:00:29.893 --> 00:00:31.850
And I have for a few years.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.440
And a few years ago, I
finally decided, hey,

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.021
I want to think about surgery.

00:00:36.021 --> 00:00:38.270
I went to all the top clinics
throughout the Bay Area,

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.310
and every single one
recommended surgery immediately.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.920
So I was even
scheduled, I think,

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.730
two or three times within
that same week to get surgery.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.630
I had heard about
Dr. Hanscom's book.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:50.630
And so I picked that up.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.040
I read it in about a week.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.169
And it immediately became a top
three favorite book all time

00:00:55.169 --> 00:00:56.960
for me for a lot of
reasons that don't even

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.280
have to do with back pain.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.190
So I'm sorry we're out of
the free books in the back,

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.860
but I definitely encourage
you to check it out.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.050
So Dr. Hanscom will
talk a little bit more

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.570
about his method, which is
also available on his website

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.000
backincontrol.com.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.640
But I should also let you
know that Dr. Hanscom is

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.620
a board certified
orthopedic surgeon

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.750
with Swedish Neuroscience
specialists based out

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:18.830
of Seattle.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.070
And his work focuses complex
spine deformities and issues

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.900
in all areas of the spine.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.360
A lot of his practice, as
he'll probably mention,

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.000
is with folks who have had
multiple previous surgeries

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.320
and are still having problems.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.680
So he's got a really cool story
personally himself and also

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.476
in his work that he'll share.

00:01:35.476 --> 00:01:37.850
Without further ado, a round
of applause for Dr. Hanscom,

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:38.350
please.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.682
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:45.360
DAVID HANSCOM: Thank you, Sach.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.580
I want to thank you very
much for having me come up.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.650
I met him about a
year ago, I think.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.474
And he was not
necessarily a believer

00:01:51.474 --> 00:01:53.140
in what we were talking
about initially.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.560
In fact, I remember the
conversation very well.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.770
But it's a up-and-down process.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:59.800
It's not hard.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.125
It's very consistent
with time and repetition.

00:02:02.125 --> 00:02:04.710
You'll see pretty quickly
this is a programming issue.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.820
That's it.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.280
Pain originates in the brain.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.980
I have some good news, and I
have some bad news for you.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.850
The bad news is that probably,
I estimate, 70% of spine surgery

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.035
should never be done.

00:02:20.035 --> 00:02:23.170
And Sach's story is
typical right now

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.620
in the American medical
culture, and it's actually

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.110
damaging people and creating
disability and pain,

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.054
not solving it.

00:02:32.054 --> 00:02:33.720
I think the medical
profession right now

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.320
is a major factor in creating
disability and chronic pain.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.360
The good news is that
the neuroscience research

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.550
has revealed to us the
answer to the problem.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.520
So it turns out that chronic
pain is very solvable.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.890
I've watched hundreds of
patients go to pain free.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.780
These are very simple,
self-directed measures.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.061
I'd like to introduce you to
one of my successes, Dr. Mark

00:02:53.061 --> 00:02:53.560
Owens.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.780
And this is his video.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.093
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:03:13.362 --> 00:03:16.380
- Broke my back in two
places, and crushed

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.660
my entire left chest in,
and punctured my lung.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.050
Had to be medevacked
to Kalispell Medical

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:29.490
Center in Montana, where they
fused my spine from my thoracic

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.690
9 to lumbar 2.

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.240
The pain got worse and worse.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.640
And I had to take more and more
opiates to control the pain.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.802
Got so bad that I couldn't
stand it any longer.

00:03:44.204 --> 00:03:51.490
They fused my lumber
2 to my lumbar 3.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:58.630
Everything from Norco to
OxyContin, oxycodone, Ultram,

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:04.630
muscle relaxers, sleeping
aids because I couldn't sleep,

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:10.410
and the pain wouldn't go away.

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.085
You become socially
isolated by your pain

00:04:14.085 --> 00:04:17.175
because people don't want
to see you suffer like that.

00:04:17.175 --> 00:04:21.910
Pain probably went from
7 to 10 all the time.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.220
The times it was so bad
I couldn't stand it,

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.710
I would just--

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.230
frankly, I got to a point
where I wanted to die.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.730
It was--

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:30.230
- Wow.

00:04:35.065 --> 00:04:39.950
- Well, finally, I went to a
surgeon in Spokane, Washington.

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.764
And they breezed into
the room and said

00:04:42.764 --> 00:04:44.430
they'd look at my
charts and everything.

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.380
And the only thing that
was going to do me any good

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.885
was [LAUGHS] what he called
the Blue Plate Special.

00:04:51.885 --> 00:04:54.320
He said, it's going
to take two surgeries.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.350
It'll take probably at least a
full day and probably two days.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.380
And we got to break
your back in two places.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.380
We're going to clean out all the
stenoses in your spinal canal

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:10.250
and in your nerve root canals,
and on, and on, and on.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.190
In the end, he said we're going
to fuse you from your collar

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.750
bone to your hips.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.275
And I said, but I'm--

00:05:18.275 --> 00:05:20.810
he said, it's not a good option.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.260
But he said it's the only
one that will work for you.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.010
Your back's a mess.

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.280
I need another opinion.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:31.190
And so I got an
appointment with Dr. David

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:37.470
Hanscom at Swedish Medical in
Seattle and went to see him.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.810
He said I see
nothing in your spine

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.210
that would cause
the pain you feel.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.390
It's like the phantom
wound syndrome.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.870
Amputees often
feel the same pain

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.685
after a limb that
is giving them pain

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:55.500
is amputated as they did
before they lost the limb.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.750
And it's, again, the
rewiring of the brain.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.430
He said, what I'm
pioneering, along

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:05.730
with some other
physicians, a program that

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:12.000
will provide an alternative to
having yet more spinal fusions.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.120
And he explained that only
around 15% to 30%, at the most,

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.420
of spinal fusions are ever
successful in alleviating pain,

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.640
even over the near term,
let alone the long term.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.646
And so he said, I would
like you to try my program.

00:06:30.646 --> 00:06:33.690
I said, well, what
does it consist of?

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.230
And he said, well, the
first thing you can do

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.035
is read my book on the subject.

00:06:39.035 --> 00:06:41.340
But he said, immediately,
you can start what

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.820
we call expressive writing.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.280
And I said, well, what is that?

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.460
And he said, well, you sit
down 15 minutes in the morning

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.470
and 15 minutes at night
and you write down

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:57.510
every negative thought you have
about anything in long hand,

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:59.010
and you tear it up.

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:00.870
And you throw it away.

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:02.795
And I said, what?

00:07:02.795 --> 00:07:04.952
[LAUGHING]

00:07:04.952 --> 00:07:07.080
First of all, I said, that
sounds like snake oil.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.440
I was really honest about it.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.780
I said, I'm a career scientist.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.960
And I'm taught to be
a critical thinker,

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.540
and by nature, skeptical anyway.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:19.000
So I frankly think this
sounds like snake oil.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.780
And he said, wait and think
what you want, he said politely.

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.500
But he said, you can always
be filleted like a salmon.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.386
[LAUGHING]

00:07:25.386 --> 00:07:27.950
And he said, there'll be plenty
of surgeons who will do that,

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:29.580
but I won't.

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:37.260
And he said, or you can try this
technique and the whole program

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.460
eventually.

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:43.090
I said to my friend, this
really sounds unbelievable.

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:48.160
And I said, like the doctor
said, I can always be filleted.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.700
I'll just try it.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:54.280
So we drove down the coast from
Seattle and stayed in a motel

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.390
at night.

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:58.860
And that night, I
actually did some

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.700
of this so-called
creative writing.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:08.600
And I woke up the next
morning, and the pain

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.940
I had been feeling, which--

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:12.830
maybe I should back up a little.

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:14.300
When you live with
pain like this,

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.758
it's like you have
a leech attached

00:08:15.758 --> 00:08:19.340
to your body or a monkey on your
back that you can't get rid of.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.350
It's always there.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:24.360
You're always thinking about it.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.710
You don't realize,
but it preoccupies

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:29.800
every aspect of your being.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.960
I woke up that morning after
doing this first session

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:33.870
of creative writing.

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:36.890
And the first thing I
noticed is that I didn't

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:41.750
have that monkey, that leech.

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:44.670
And at first, I'd
forgotten I'd even

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:47.070
done the negative writing,
or the creative writing,

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:48.730
the night before.

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:51.972
And I thought what's
going on here?

00:08:51.972 --> 00:08:52.935
This is great.

00:08:52.935 --> 00:08:53.655
It still hurts.

00:08:53.655 --> 00:08:56.510
But it's nothing like it was.

00:08:56.510 --> 00:09:00.170
To make a long story short,
after another 24 hours,

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:06.750
I was 85% pain
free, 85% pain free.

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:13.220
And today, what, three
years later more or less,

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.740
yes, I have pain.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:18.700
But it's pain that's easily
controllable with a Tylenol.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.210
And sometimes I'll go
through three weeks or more

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:23.976
without even taking a Tylenol.

00:09:23.976 --> 00:09:28.860
And I'm living a reasonably
normal life, a fairly active

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:33.486
life-- riding horses,
chainsawing and cutting wood,

00:09:33.486 --> 00:09:35.595
again, doing physical things.

00:09:35.595 --> 00:09:36.560
[ENGINE ROARS]

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.470
And they do make my
back uncomfortable.

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:42.510
But I don't have this
debilitating, crippling pain.

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:47.910
Basically, by visiting Dr.
Hanscom, I got my life back.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:51.389
[END PLAYBACK]

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.830
DAVID HANSCOM: I mean,
he had chronic pain

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:05.170
for nine solid years.

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:08.100
He had sought every
imaginable cure possible.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.120
He had seen over 30 physicians.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.640
He had two high level
surgeons recommend a fusion

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.800
from his neck to his pelvis.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.950
The complication rate of
that operation is about 70%

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.565
with half of those being major.

00:10:19.565 --> 00:10:21.940
The chance of actually solving
his pain with that surgery

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.560
is about 20% to 25%.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.100
So within six weeks,
he was pain free.

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.890
He and I have become good
friends along with my wife.

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:31.390
And he's fine.

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:33.130
He lives a normal life.

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:35.950
And if any of us did half the
work that he did at age 72,

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:37.510
our backs would be killing us.

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:39.640
He's fine.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.310
So visualize what his
life would have been like

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:47.516
if he'd had that 12 hours of
surgery, high dose narcotics.

00:10:47.516 --> 00:10:48.890
It would have been
a big problem.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:17.700
So the purpose of my
talk today is to show you

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:20.070
that this is not magic.

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:21.940
This is not a belief system.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.600
This is basically every human
being has their own capacity

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.610
to heal, every one of us.

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:29.990
From an evolutionary standpoint,
that would make sense, right?

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:34.529
The key is Mark somehow quickly
found his capacity to heal.

00:11:34.529 --> 00:11:35.820
I hear this story all the time.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.514
This is not an unusual story.

00:11:37.514 --> 00:11:39.430
I've watched hundreds
and hundreds of patients

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:41.860
go to pain free, not
managing the pain,

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.940
but actually solving the pain.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.305
So it is my belief--

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:53.740
and I'm sort of a technophobe.

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.440
I have to tell you this.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.610
But I believe that one of
the most basic needs that

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:01.080
makes us human is to be
in charge of our destiny

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.474
with a sense of worth.

00:12:02.474 --> 00:12:04.890
Successfully treating patients
suffering from chronic pain

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:07.770
requires reconnecting them with
their vision and their purpose

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:08.910
in life.

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:10.710
When you're in chronic
pain and suffering,

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:12.615
you become completely
disconnected.

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:20.350
So what happened to Mark?

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:23.650
So as a physician, when we
walk into the office, when

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:26.070
we give lectures ever
since I've been a resident,

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:28.400
there is quote,
"the ideal patient."

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.090
That means they're employed.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:32.140
They're not on disability.

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:32.890
They're motivated.

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:33.370
They're smart.

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:34.203
They're intelligent.

00:12:34.203 --> 00:12:35.170
He was all of those.

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:36.620
OK?

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:38.582
What happened?

00:12:38.582 --> 00:12:40.290
And so what we do as
surgeons-- we think,

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:42.081
well, we can figure
this out in the clinic.

00:12:42.081 --> 00:12:44.525
But remember, we're
on a volume schedule.

00:12:44.525 --> 00:12:46.100
We're in a busy clinic.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:48.980
We have 10 to 15 minutes,
maybe half an hour at the most.

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:52.160
And remember, two surgeons made
a diagnosis, a recommendation,

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:56.431
for a 12-hour surgery on the
first visit, the first visit.

00:12:56.431 --> 00:12:56.930
OK?

00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:59.240
That's a big deal.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:03.410
Sach had recommendations
for surgery for back pain.

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:06.139
Were this on the first
visit also many times?

00:13:06.139 --> 00:13:07.930
And often patients come
to me saying, well,

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:10.420
their surgeons really had an
urgency to do this operation.

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:14.670
They try to sign them up
right there in the office.

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:16.932
So the research has two
papers-- this is one of them--

00:13:16.932 --> 00:13:18.390
where surgeons
actually-- it's been

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:22.590
documented that surgeons have a
limited ability to assess risk.

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:25.410
So the DRAM is a risk
assessment score--

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:28.180
Depression, Anxiety, which
is called somatization, where

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.300
you can't focus on your body.

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.670
So they gave this test to
a 125 orthopedic patients

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:34.560
prospectively.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.990
And they identified
54 patients at risk.

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:40.636
And 35 of those patients
were actually distressed.

00:13:40.636 --> 00:13:42.260
So then they asked
the surgeons to rate

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.750
their patients
about how much risk

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:49.040
this person was, they were
correct 26% of the time.

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.191
That's it.

00:13:50.191 --> 00:13:52.190
And it didn't matter if
you're a medical student

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:54.050
or a senior attending.

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:56.165
They couldn't tell in
clinic who was at risk.

00:13:56.165 --> 00:13:56.790
Couldn't do it.

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:05.210
So with Mark, what the
physicians didn't see

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:08.060
is that he had been in
Africa for 23 years.

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:09.530
He was very idealistic.

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:11.960
He went off into the
wilderness with his wife,

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.400
without even a gun.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.250
The animals were so
wild that they had never

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:18.140
even seen a human being.

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:19.250
But he's idealistic.

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:21.699
He didn't understand the risk.

00:14:21.699 --> 00:14:23.990
So the corruption he was
dealing with with the poachers

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.698
was unbelievable.

00:14:24.698 --> 00:14:27.140
It went all the way to the top.

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:30.020
He's flying helicopters and
airplanes without navigation.

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:31.520
He had bad weather.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:35.060
His wife never knew if he
was coming back or not.

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:39.510
And he had three
assassination attempts.

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:41.360
That's stress.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:45.920
Then he came home and
bought a 700-acre ranch

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:49.075
and created a preserve for
grizzly bears and wolves,

00:14:49.075 --> 00:14:50.450
which, of course,
didn't make him

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:53.370
incredibly popular with the
local ranchers, et cetera.

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:55.130
So stress continued.

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:57.080
But see, for someone
like Mark and myself,

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.400
and I'm guessing most of
the people in this room,

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.154
the stress is just
what you do, right?

00:15:01.154 --> 00:15:02.570
I mean, isn't it
one of our badges

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:04.160
of honor that we just do stress?

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.250
So Mark didn't think that
was a problem except it's

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:09.350
been documented over
and over and over

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:12.080
again, over 100
years by the way,

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.065
that your body doesn't lie.

00:15:14.065 --> 00:15:15.440
So even though
you intellectually

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.360
suppress the stress and
keep plowing forward--

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:17.870
you're tough.

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:18.578
You're resilient.

00:15:18.578 --> 00:15:19.670
You can take it.

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:22.220
Again, that's a badge of honor,
particularly for surgeons.

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:23.900
We're suppressing
things like crazy.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.330
And our body is
creating symptoms.

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:32.270
So I want to explain to you the
basic neurophysiology before I

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:34.930
go into the rest of this story
about what happened to Mark.

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:37.470
As I [INAUDIBLE] the neural
system as a junction box.

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:40.640
And every one of us in
this room, every second

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:44.340
is interpreting sensory input
to figure out what's going on--

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:48.155
the temperature, the shape
of the chair, the doors.

00:15:48.155 --> 00:15:50.400
The only reason your brain
says that's a chair--

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:50.900
I'm sorry.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:53.480
The only reason you
recognize that's a chair

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.540
is your brain's taking visual
signals, unscramble those.

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:58.249
And said that's a chair.

00:15:58.249 --> 00:15:59.290
Well, that's a chair too.

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:00.980
That's a different chair.

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:03.390
So your brain is comparing
everything every second.

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:05.090
Same thing with pain.

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:09.994
This is not painful only because
my brain says it's not painful.

00:16:09.994 --> 00:16:11.660
So the sum total of
the nervous system I

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:15.560
call the junction box,
so all these senses--

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.240
our vision, touch,
feel, sound, taste,

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.425
smell, with the
obvious various organs.

00:16:19.425 --> 00:16:22.910
But there's nothing about your
nose that can smell anything.

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:26.200
If you disconnect the
nose from the brain,

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.270
they're just receptors.

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:27.770
That's it.

00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:29.956
Your brain has to
unscramble the signals.

00:16:29.956 --> 00:16:32.330
There's also another sensation
we don't think about much.

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:35.780
It's called interoception,
where if your stomach's full,

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:37.880
bladder's full,
et cetera, you're

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.460
body's also sensing
those sensations also.

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:42.530
The sum total of
these every second

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:44.067
is competing for attention.

00:16:44.067 --> 00:16:45.650
On the other side,
there's going to be

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:52.570
a total of either pleasant,
neutral, or unpleasant.

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:56.265
And if it's
pleasant, your body's

00:16:56.265 --> 00:16:59.360
going to secrete reward
chemicals like oxytocin,

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:03.490
serotonin, dopamine, the value
type drugs, the GABA drugs.

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:07.640
And if it's unpleasant, your
body is going to be tight,

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.659
tense, trying to avoid danger.

00:17:09.659 --> 00:17:11.450
It's going to secrete
adrenaline, cortisol,

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:14.170
endorphins, histamines,
different stress chemicals.

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:16.036
Then you feel anxiety.

00:17:16.036 --> 00:17:22.160
When we feel the positive
drugs, you feel relaxed, right?

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.200
It's not just I feel relaxed.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.180
You actually feel relaxed.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.010
When you feel the
unpleasant chemicals,

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:30.980
you actually feel anxiety.

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:34.010
Therefore, anxiety is
simply a chemical reaction

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:34.980
to the environment.

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:36.922
That's it, end of the story.

00:17:36.922 --> 00:17:39.380
The reason it's so critical to
understand anxiety is simply

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:41.140
chemical response
to the environment

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.990
is that the unconscious brain,
which every living creature

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:47.640
has, is a million times
stronger than the human brain,

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:48.920
than the consciousness.

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.920
The unconscious brain is
a million-to-one ratio

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:54.455
of unconscious reactions
to the conscious brain.

00:17:54.455 --> 00:17:55.330
So you can't stop it.

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:56.507
You can't control it.

00:17:56.507 --> 00:17:58.340
So anxiety's part of
an unconscious survival

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:01.250
reflex that you can't control.

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:01.750
What

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:04.270
Happens is your body, they
way your brain's programmed

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:06.930
evolutionary-wise is that your
behavior is governed in a way

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:09.430
where you stay in a range where
you're not looking at bright

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:11.600
lights--

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.350
that was not--
that was a mistake.

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:16.330
Or you're not putting
your hand on hot stoves

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:17.955
because your body
says that's a danger.

00:18:17.955 --> 00:18:19.871
So the nociceptive system,
or the pain system,

00:18:19.871 --> 00:18:21.460
actually keeps you out of pain.

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:23.440
It doesn't produce pain, OK?

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.570
So that's why the
whole behavior's

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:28.940
gauged around sensory input.

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:30.470
So why is it so persistent?

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:33.330
OK, you avoid the
behaviors, et cetera.

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:34.650
You stay in a neutral range.

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:36.750
Why is it so persistent?

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:40.170
So the problem is that--

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:42.660
Shakespeare may have been
the first neuroscientist,

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:45.490
where he pointed out, "There
is nothing either good or bad,

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:47.430
but thinking makes it so."

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:52.030
So humans have a major
problem called consciousness.

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:54.806
We're the only species
to have consciousness.

00:18:54.806 --> 00:18:56.680
The recent neuroscience
research the last two

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:58.554
years has been stunning
because what it shows

00:18:58.554 --> 00:19:01.350
is that thoughts go to the
same area of the brain,

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:04.840
you get the same
chemical response.

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:07.950
So pleasant thoughts give
you reward chemicals.

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:09.280
You feel relaxed.

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.560
Unpleasant thoughts give
you unpleasant chemicals

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:14.300
and anxiety.

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:16.300
But there's a major problem.

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:19.290
You can't escape your thoughts.

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:22.630
So no matter who
you're talking to,

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:24.085
people say, I'm not anxious.

00:19:24.085 --> 00:19:26.210
And actually, that was me
until I was 38 years old.

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:27.370
I'm not anxious.

00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:29.786
Because you are so good at
masking it, and not recognizing

00:19:29.786 --> 00:19:32.690
it, and not acknowledging it
that we think it's not there.

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:35.570
Every living
creature has anxiety.

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:38.070
Again, thoughts are a problem.

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:39.389
So we separate the thoughts.

00:19:39.389 --> 00:19:40.680
They get worse as we get older.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.449
Again, it's a programming issue.

00:19:42.449 --> 00:19:44.740
We have all sorts of masking
behaviors like addictions,

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:48.140
and one of my favorite
ones is being a workaholic.

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:50.671
And I like to think
that's not an addiction.

00:19:50.671 --> 00:19:51.920
I told my daughter what it is.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.990
Look, I'm not a workaholic.

00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.920
She goes, really?

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:55.500
I go, yeah.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.989
I said, I really,
really enjoy what I do.

00:19:57.989 --> 00:20:00.030
And she looked at me and
goes, well, every addict

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:01.080
likes their drug.

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:03.320
So OK, OK, touché.

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:03.990
There you go.

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:06.000
Nothing like having kids, right?

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.600
And then suppressing
is what I did.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.350
That's how I became a
major spine surgeon.

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:11.490
I went to one of the top spine
fellowships in the world.

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:12.340
I didn't have anxiety.

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:13.710
I didn't get there
by having anxiety.

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:16.460
I'd get there by suppressing it
at the level you can't imagine,

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:17.335
and just bring it on.

00:20:17.335 --> 00:20:19.876
And I'm guessing a lot of people
in this room have the same--

00:20:19.876 --> 00:20:22.380
I use the word gunner
mode-- of just bring it on.

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:22.950
Right?

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:25.290
I can take this.

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:28.260
The problem is with repetition,
whether you suffer, suppress,

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:32.340
or mask, you get this repetition
going where these pathways

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:34.450
or circuits become
programmed in your brain

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:36.160
and they become permanent.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.220
So it's just like
riding a bicycle.

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:40.110
Once you know how
to ride a bicycle,

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:43.230
how do you unlearn
how to ride a bicycle?

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:45.537
The skill can drop down
with disuse, but all of us

00:20:45.537 --> 00:20:48.120
know how to ride a bicycle that
learned how to ride a bicycle.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:57.032
Then the pain circuits are
reinforced with repetition.

00:20:57.032 --> 00:20:59.240
There is a book I have people
read called "The Talent

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:02.180
Code," which is about artists,
athletes, and musicians.

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:04.370
With deep repetition,
you actually

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:07.170
learn neurological
circuits that are repeated.

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:09.020
But there's very
specific repetitions

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:10.340
over very specific moves.

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:12.380
It's how you learn genius.

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:15.330
So pain pathways are like that
in that they're very specific.

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:17.120
They're coming from
one part of the body.

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.070
The repetition is very fast.

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:21.549
So they become reinforced and
permeate very quickly, much

00:21:21.549 --> 00:21:23.840
faster than a professional
athlete or musician learning

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:24.569
a skill.

00:21:24.569 --> 00:21:26.360
And so they get reinforced
with repetition.

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.710
It's a programming problem.

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:30.550
So then you have a
situation now where

00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:32.749
you can't escape your thoughts.

00:21:32.749 --> 00:21:34.290
If somebody has a
different approach,

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:36.270
let me know, between suffer,
suppressing, and masking.

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:38.070
I've actually asked
audiences for decades,

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:40.160
and not gotten an
answer to that.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.490
That's all we know how to do.

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:45.610
So what happens is, you're in
a continuous chemical assault.

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:48.600
The research terms called
"Unpleasant Repetitive

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.140
Thoughts," URTs.

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:53.940
So what's happening is
that everybody in this room

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:57.720
is under a greater or lesser
degree of an adrenaline storm.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.790
We're being assaulted by
our own body chemistry.

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:01.470
And it gets worse
as you get older.

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:06.270
So then the problem
becomes even worse

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:09.690
because what would
happen to your anxiety

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:11.610
if you held your
hand over a stove?

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:13.610
It would go up, right?

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:16.230
And what would you do?

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:17.050
OK.

00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:19.660
So what would happen to your
anxiety if I took your hand

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.720
and grabbed it and forced you
to hold it over the stove?

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:25.088
What would be your
next reaction?

00:22:25.088 --> 00:22:27.220
Yeah, you would be angry, right?

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:31.000
So it turns out that anxiety
and anger are the same thing.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.710
So it's a survival response.

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:34.870
The antidote to
anxiety is control.

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:37.830
You either control a situation,
or avoid it to control it,

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:41.950
anxiety assault. When
you're trapped by anything,

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:45.940
your body kicks in more
chemistry to solve the problem.

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:49.160
So basically, anger is
anxiety on steroids.

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:52.750
It's just it cranked
up the body chemistry.

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:56.190
So we're trapped by our
thoughts, a problem.

00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:58.650
Then you get trapped by
your pain, another problem.

00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:00.690
Both are equally a problem.

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:01.700
And what happens--

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:03.949
Dr. Sarno years ago
called this the rage.

00:23:03.949 --> 00:23:05.490
And what happens,
your body is really

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:06.531
full of stress chemicals.

00:23:06.531 --> 00:23:09.090
I'm using just adrenaline as
one of the representations

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:10.890
of the stress chemicals
because we all know

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:12.780
what adrenaline is all about.

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:15.210
But you have this really
high level of adrenaline

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:16.790
by being trapped by anything.

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:20.150
Circumstances, finances,
relationships, pain, thoughts,

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:21.830
whatever they are,
when you're trapped,

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:23.510
your body's cranked up.

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:25.745
Right?

00:23:25.745 --> 00:23:28.120
So what happens is like driving
your car down the freeway

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:30.120
in a low gear,
second or third gear.

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.587
Your engine, your RPMs
are 5,000, 6,000 7,000.

00:23:32.587 --> 00:23:33.920
You're driving down the freeway.

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:34.870
What happens?

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:38.590
It's going to break down.

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:40.030
So what happens
in the human body

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:42.730
is that every organ
system is now bathed

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:44.570
in a chemical environment.

00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:48.460
And what happens is that
there's over 30 symptoms

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:51.070
of a cranked-up nervous system.

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:53.850
This is probably a
conservative list--

00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:57.280
migraine headaches,
tinnitus, burning sensations

00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:02.250
around the body, anxiety/panic
attacks, insomnia, depression,

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:06.810
PTSD, chronic tendinitis,
obsessive thought patterns,

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:10.560
irritable bowel syndrome,
obsessive compulsive disorder,

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:14.340
acid reflux, different back
pains, neck pains, chest pains,

00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:19.500
skin rashes, itchiness in
the scalp, tension headaches,

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:24.130
heart sensations, eating
issues, and spastic bladder.

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:25.560
This is not a complete list.

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:28.260
But I just want you to stop for
a second to think about this.

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:29.727
OK, your body's cranked up.

00:24:29.727 --> 00:24:31.060
You're trapped by your thoughts.

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:32.235
You're trapped by your pain.

00:24:32.235 --> 00:24:33.360
You're trapped by your job.

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:37.470
Whatever it is you're trapped
by, you're not very happy.

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:41.710
So the chemical consequences
of being trapped are high.

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:44.980
Remember, each organ system
secretes its own chemicals.

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:47.700
Each organ system's going
to respond in its own way.

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:49.200
That's why there's
so many symptoms.

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:53.894
So what happened to Mark?

00:24:53.894 --> 00:24:56.060
OK, so normally, it sounds
like it'd be operational.

00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:57.020
He broke his back.

00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:58.910
He got thrown from a horse.

00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:02.630
He almost froze to death the
night before, et cetera, right?

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:04.796
So it sounds like, well,
you know chronic pain could

00:25:04.796 --> 00:25:07.150
be sort of logical, right?

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:08.110
No?

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:09.730
Big injury, big surgery.

00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:12.220
So I do this surgery every week.

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:15.040
The normal post-operative
course is two days

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.490
of misery, a week in between.

00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:21.460
By two weeks, the surgical pain
is gone, and by three months,

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:23.142
people are fine.

00:25:23.142 --> 00:25:25.600
So you see the bruising on his
side there from broken ribs.

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.210
He's got a nicely
healed surgical scar.

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:31.750
So if this had happened
20 years earlier,

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:33.670
the chances of him
going into chronic pain

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:35.290
would have been almost zero.

00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:38.140
This is not the normal
post-operative course.

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:39.835
So what happened?

00:25:39.835 --> 00:25:42.210
So there's a paper out of
Chicago, which was fascinating.

00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:46.770
It was published in 2013.

00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:48.780
They took a group of volunteers.

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:51.270
They did these research
MRI scans on the brain.

00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:54.030
They found out
that with back pain

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:56.910
that there's a certain part
of the brain that lights up

00:25:56.910 --> 00:25:58.390
every time, consistent.

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:01.270
It's called the
nociceptive center.

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:03.140
So they took patients,
or volunteers,

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:05.115
who had back pain for
less than two months.

00:26:05.115 --> 00:26:07.931
And they saw that the pain
center lit up like it should.

00:26:07.931 --> 00:26:09.680
Then they took people
who had chronic back

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:12.980
for more than 10 years, and
the pain center was quiet.

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:15.230
There's no activity in the
pain center on these people

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:17.390
with chronic back pain.

00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:20.150
Guess where the center
of activity was?

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:21.890
There's an emotional center.

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:24.674
And it completely shifted
from the emotional center--

00:26:24.674 --> 00:26:26.840
sorry-- from the pain center
to the emotional center

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:28.203
in about 12 months.

00:26:28.203 --> 00:26:31.460
It happened to every
patient, every time.

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:33.250
So we all know about
phantom limb pain,

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:34.765
which is fascinating.

00:26:34.765 --> 00:26:36.670
And from medical school
on, it's been sort of

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:38.380
glossed over in my training.

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:39.970
This is a big deal.

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:41.110
I'm an orthopedic surgeon.

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:42.760
I've done many amputations.

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.400
It's sort of a disturbing
process to take a limb

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:46.810
and put it into a bucket.

00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:48.570
So you know where the
pain's coming from.

00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:50.560
It's completely gone.

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:54.770
Over half the patients feel the
leg, and they feel the pain.

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:56.290
What's wrong with that picture?

00:26:56.290 --> 00:26:58.720
That's a big deal.

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.720
So what happens is that
the pain is still there,

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.094
with the back
pain, for instance.

00:27:02.094 --> 00:27:04.230
But again, it can happen
in any part of the body.

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:08.370
The pain is still there,
but it's a different driver.

00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:10.260
So instead of being
the pain center,

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:12.930
it's now the emotional center.

00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:14.610
The other thing I
illustrate a lot with

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:18.681
is that when you turn a light
switch on, where's the light?

00:27:18.681 --> 00:27:19.430
It's at the light.

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:20.430
It's not at the switch.

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:21.270
Right?

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:22.410
So when the pain
center in the brain

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:25.034
is turned on, whether it's from
an emotional source in the pain

00:27:25.034 --> 00:27:28.300
center, the pain is going to
be here, not in your brain.

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:36.050
So we know there's plenty of
risk factors for poor outcomes.

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:39.580
There is younger
age, being female,

00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:43.030
the length of the pain,
the severity of the injury,

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:46.120
anxiety, depression,
catastrophizing, fear

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.770
avoidance, high dose narcotics.

00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:52.360
All those are major risk--
oh, sleep, that's a huge one.

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:55.667
Those are all major risk factors
for poor surgical outcomes.

00:27:55.667 --> 00:27:57.250
And I've known that
for over 30 years.

00:27:57.250 --> 00:27:59.560
This has been in the medical
literature for over 60 years.

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:00.800
It's been there a long time.

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:01.732
We know this.

00:28:01.732 --> 00:28:03.190
From medical school
on, we're told,

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:05.500
if you take a patient
who's stressed out--

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:07.709
they don't talk about the
body chemistry, by the way.

00:28:07.709 --> 00:28:08.958
By they way, I'm just curious.

00:28:08.958 --> 00:28:11.130
How people learned about
adrenaline in high school?

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:11.690
Can you raise your hands?

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:12.410
I'm just curious.

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:13.070
OK.

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:15.500
So that, to me, that's
why I'm a little perplexed

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.340
that the medical
system has missed this

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:19.340
because when you're under
stress for any reason,

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:21.920
your body's full of adrenaline.

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:25.370
So the research paper out of
Baltimore showed that only 10%

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:28.046
of orthopedic surgeons
and neurosurgeons

00:28:28.046 --> 00:28:29.420
were assessing
these risk factors

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:31.550
before they did surgery.

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:32.552
And guess what?

00:28:32.552 --> 00:28:34.010
The outcomes were
all over the map.

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:35.510
In fact, the outcomes
were very bad

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:38.251
when these risk factors
weren't addressed.

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.970
So the definition of
chronic pain, now--

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:50.180
this is from Chicago,
but neuroscience centers

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:53.100
around the world have come
to this common definition

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:55.370
that chronic pain is an
"imbedded memory that

00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:58.970
becomes linked with more
and more life experiences,

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:00.395
and the memory can't be erased."

00:29:02.372 --> 00:29:04.330
And there's another saying
that neuroscientists

00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:07.130
have that neurons that fire
together wire together.

00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:10.120
So if you have back
pain when you climbed

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:13.000
a certain set of steps,
again, every time you

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.574
climb those steps, your
brain links that with pain.

00:29:17.574 --> 00:29:18.990
So this is not
psychological, this

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:21.535
is simply a direct link
with a chemical response.

00:29:21.535 --> 00:29:25.210
It has nothing to
do with psychology.

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:28.690
So again, I'm going to ask
people to raise their hands.

00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:30.790
How many people
are given the idea

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:32.710
that surgery is the
definitive solution?

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:34.960
Is that a common belief
amongst this crowd?

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.640
A little bit.

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:37.776
So in doctors, it is.

00:29:37.776 --> 00:29:40.276
I mean, when I first started
my training for the first seven

00:29:40.276 --> 00:29:42.220
or eight years, I felt
like as a surgeon,

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:43.690
you've suffered for a long time.

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:46.180
I felt obligated,
literally obligated,

00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:47.990
to find a solution
to your problem.

00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:49.690
What else do you do?

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:50.960
You've tried everything else.

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.685
And so no matter
what happens, you're

00:29:53.685 --> 00:29:55.810
going to try to find a
reason to solve the problem.

00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:57.630
Right?

00:29:57.630 --> 00:30:00.670
Well, really?

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:03.890
So here's some of the data.

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:07.750
So the problem is, you're
using a structural solution

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:09.590
for a neurological diagnosis.

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:11.210
You're way off target.

00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:12.310
It can't work.

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:13.180
It just can't work.

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:13.804
And guess what?

00:30:13.804 --> 00:30:16.380
It doesn't work.

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:21.300
So the analogy I like to use is
that I'm going to the dentist

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:23.910
with a cavity that's painful.

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:25.170
You know where the problem is.

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:27.060
The dentist either
pulls the tooth

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:28.770
or fills the cavity or crown.

00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:29.460
Problem solved.

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:29.959
Right?

00:30:29.959 --> 00:30:32.700
Happens almost 100% of the time.

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:35.324
But if you go to the
dentist with mouth pain,

00:30:35.324 --> 00:30:36.990
and you don't know
where the problem is,

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:39.060
and you start filling
teeth, pulling teeth,

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:43.020
whatever, the chances of
success are very, very low.

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:45.360
With back pain, we
actually don't know

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:46.524
where the pain coming from.

00:30:46.524 --> 00:30:48.440
We know where the pain's
coming from literally

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:51.680
15% of the time, 1-5.

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:54.232
So you start doing these
big procedures on something

00:30:54.232 --> 00:30:55.940
that you don't know
what the solution is.

00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:58.000
Spine surgery has a
terrible reputation.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.570
And it actually is deserved.

00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:03.380
So surgery works extremely
well for a structural problem.

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:04.700
I do lots of surgery.

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:07.200
We have a high success rate,
but I can see what we're doing.

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:10.480
You can't fix something
you can't see.

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.230
What I didn't know
until a few years ago--

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:14.654
and this data has actually
been around for a while--

00:31:14.654 --> 00:31:17.070
is that when you have chronic
pain in your nervous system,

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:20.040
and you do surgery in
another part of the body,

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:25.072
you can create chronic
pain in the new body part.

00:31:25.072 --> 00:31:26.780
So let's take our
hernia repair, which is

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:28.360
a very straightforward surgery.

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:30.620
And say you've had chronic
neck pain for five years.

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:32.540
The hernia goes beautifully.

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:34.580
You can induce chronic
pain at the hernia site

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:37.360
between 5% to 60% of the time.

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:41.780
And up to 4% of the time,
it can become permanent.

00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:43.160
Surgeons aren't taught this.

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:44.150
I wasn't.

00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:46.400
Patients aren't really
told that chronic pain

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.230
can be a complication of a
simple, well-performed surgery.

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:50.280
And it's a big deal.

00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:57.615
So in defense of
the surgeons, when

00:31:57.615 --> 00:31:59.760
we talk about a
Blue Plate Special,

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:02.740
that's all we're trained to do.

00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:05.360
And we're not really
taught about chronic pain.

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:07.000
We're not taught
about sleep, stress.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.950
Actually, we sort
of know about it.

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:11.220
But then surgeons, the way
we become compartmentalized

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:14.160
as specialists, we're
responsible for this part

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.440
of the problem, but not the
whole part of the problem.

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:18.250
And so there's been
a real disconnect.

00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:20.789
So the physicians
are well-intentioned,

00:32:20.789 --> 00:32:23.080
but the business of medicine
has made it very difficult

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:25.180
for us to actually take
time to talk to and listen

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:27.400
to the patients.

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:32.440
So with Mark's situation, I will
admit that that first visit,

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:35.200
I did not know his background.

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.210
But it was easy for him
because I never, ever

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:39.520
make a surgical decision
on the first visit, ever.

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:40.330
I don't know you.

00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:41.260
You don't know me.

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:42.790
I don't know the circumstances.

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:45.094
The last 10 years,
I have learned a lot

00:32:45.094 --> 00:32:46.510
that when people
are under stress,

00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:48.550
the body chemistry
changes, and symptoms

00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:50.959
start arising that
had not arisen before.

00:32:50.959 --> 00:32:52.750
So with Mark, it was
actually pretty simple

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:56.290
because he did not
have a surgical lesion.

00:32:56.290 --> 00:32:59.980
How many people here have been
told that degenerative disc

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:01.220
disease is a problem?

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:02.530
Anybody heard that?

00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:03.790
OK.

00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:06.530
So we don't know where back pain
comes from most of the time.

00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:08.980
But we actually know--

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:11.800
it's been well-documented--
that arthritis,

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.830
bulging disc, herniated
disc, degenerative

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:16.800
disc actually don't cause pain.

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:19.060
They are not a source of pain.

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:20.538
Is that surprising to anybody?

00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:25.360
It's a problem because
your spine becomes stiffer.

00:33:28.135 --> 00:33:30.310
But it's been well-documented
that it is not

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:32.460
a source of pain yet.

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:37.110
It is a reason to do surgery
on over 500,000 people per year

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:38.360
right now.

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:40.140
They estimate by
2020, it will be

00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:42.844
up over a million people per
year getting spine fusions.

00:33:42.844 --> 00:33:44.010
So with Mark, it was simple.

00:33:44.010 --> 00:33:45.630
He's got some disc degeneration.

00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:48.060
He had some arthritis
here, here, here, and here.

00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:50.330
Here's his rods down
in through here.

00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:54.120
Let me just point up to there.

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:54.933
There's no real--

00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:01.160
Anyway, he has his
arthritis on left side.

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:03.140
He's got some
narrowing of the disc.

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:03.809
And that's fine.

00:34:03.809 --> 00:34:05.600
So that's a normal
spine for somebody who's

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:07.535
68 years old, flat-out normal.

00:34:07.535 --> 00:34:11.861
OK, if anyone of you had a MRI
scan of your spine, especially

00:34:11.861 --> 00:34:14.110
those without pain, you're
going to have degeneration.

00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:16.560
It is not a source of pain.

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:18.659
So Mark's case was
pretty simple for me.

00:34:18.659 --> 00:34:20.420
So I'm just picking
one study out of many.

00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:22.730
This was done in 2006
out of Stanford here.

00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:25.159
They took patients who had
an unstable spine, actually

00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:27.770
moving back and forth
about 4 millimeters, what

00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:31.310
surgeons consider a source
of pain, and they fused them.

00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:34.380
They found out the
success rate was 72%

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:37.415
at two years, which, to me,
is lower than it should be.

00:34:37.415 --> 00:34:39.380
To me, it should be 100%.

00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:41.060
But then they did
this disc study,

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:42.230
where they inject a
dye into the disc.

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:44.389
If the disc was painful,
then they would fuse it.

00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:46.150
They did one level fusions.

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:50.880
They found out the success
rate was 27% percent.

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:54.000
Other papers show 15%, 22%, 24%.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.199
There's not one
paper, not one paper

00:34:56.199 --> 00:34:58.840
that says that a fusion
works for back pain.

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:00.530
Not one.

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:04.040
Surgery now is a $13
billion a year industry.

00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:11.910
So I stopped doing surgery
in 1993 for back pain.

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:14.460
I quit doing fusion
for back pain in 1993.

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:15.680
But I didn't know what to do.

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:16.221
What do I do?

00:35:16.221 --> 00:35:17.250
So I was a surgeon.

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:18.420
I was trained to do fusions.

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:21.870
I felt guilty if I didn't find
a reason to do the fusion.

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:24.100
And so what happened, I
learned it the hard way.

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:28.770
So I became a chronic pain
sufferer for over 15 years.

00:35:28.770 --> 00:35:30.750
That's how this book
evolved was my own ordeal

00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:32.700
with chronic pain.

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:36.900
And I had 16 of those
symptoms I mentioned before.

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:39.420
I had ringing in my ears,
burning feet, skin rashes,

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:41.820
itching scalp,
insomnia, anxiety, OCD.

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:43.410
You name it, I had it.

00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:45.940
I had no idea what
was going on, no idea.

00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:47.800
And nobody could tell me.

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:48.810
So I became desperate.

00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:50.040
I had no hope.

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:52.180
I didn't know what was going on.

00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:54.707
And by pure luck, I ran
across this recommendation

00:35:54.707 --> 00:35:56.790
by Dr. David Burns-- here
at Stanford, by the way.

00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:59.130
And he and I have become
pretty good friends.

00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:02.830
And Jeff has been nice enough
to introduce me to him again.

00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:05.170
David Burns wrote a book
called "Feeling Good."

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:08.110
And David Burns said
to start writing.

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:10.160
So I started writing
his technique.

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:13.710
And I initially thought it was
the book, but I later found out

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:15.510
was actually the writing.

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:18.420
There's over 300 research
papers that document

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:21.600
that expressive writing,
different forms of it, work.

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:24.750
They break up all
sorts of pain cycles.

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:25.860
Performance goes up.

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:26.930
Grades go up.

00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:28.140
Asthma improves.

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:29.250
Skin heals faster.

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:30.180
It's unbelievable.

00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:32.250
And nobody knows why it works.

00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:33.630
But there's way
more data on this

00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:37.380
than there is on spine surgery.

00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:40.042
So basically, it's
on my website.

00:36:40.042 --> 00:36:42.250
You simply write down your
thoughts and tear them up.

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:44.150
And you tear them
up for two reasons.

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:46.410
First of all, you can't
not control your thoughts,

00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:47.802
but you can separate from them.

00:36:47.802 --> 00:36:50.260
You've heard the philosophers
say for centuries that you're

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:53.534
not your thoughts, and they
use meditation to separate.

00:36:53.534 --> 00:36:55.200
I call this mechanical
meditation, where

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:57.040
you write down your thoughts.

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:59.280
There's a space between
you and your thoughts.

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:02.250
That space is now connected
with vision and feel, which is

00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:04.181
part of the unconscious brain.

00:37:04.181 --> 00:37:06.430
And the reason why you rip
them up is for two reasons.

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:07.638
One is to write with freedom.

00:37:07.638 --> 00:37:09.972
And by the way, it can be
positive or negative thoughts.

00:37:09.972 --> 00:37:12.304
Most of the research has been
done on negative thoughts,

00:37:12.304 --> 00:37:13.680
but it doesn't really matter.

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:15.429
But the other reason
that you rip them up,

00:37:15.429 --> 00:37:17.250
which is more important,
is that if you

00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:19.500
want to analyze and
fix these things,

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:21.900
where is your attention?

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:24.370
It's on your thoughts.

00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:25.930
So I still do it,
20 years later.

00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:28.580
If I quit doing my
writing exercises,

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:31.004
the first thing that happens
is my wife asks me, she goes,

00:37:31.004 --> 00:37:32.670
honey, have you been
doing your writing?

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:33.204
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:33.204 --> 00:37:34.870
Because we tend both
to get a little bit

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:37.450
snappy when we don't do
it because we get anxious.

00:37:37.450 --> 00:37:38.920
And I don't sleep as well.

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:40.960
These little skin rashes pop up.

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:43.570
So about two weeks almost to
the day, if I quit my writing

00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:45.250
exercises, which I
do maybe one or two

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:46.610
minutes is all it takes--

00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:47.860
it's like brushing your teeth.

00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:50.000
It's really simple.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.375
So with neuroplasticity,
you want

00:37:51.375 --> 00:37:55.534
to do awareness, separation,
then you want to redirect.

00:37:55.534 --> 00:37:57.700
It's like directing a river
into different channels.

00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:00.158
You want to come off the pain
circuits into a different set

00:38:00.158 --> 00:38:00.850
of circuits.

00:38:00.850 --> 00:38:02.980
So it's things like
visualization, good food,

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:04.550
good wine, good friends.

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:08.780
Meditation, that's the
re-visualization tool.

00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:13.930
So you have a situation now
where you have chronic pain.

00:38:13.930 --> 00:38:16.030
You have an adrenalized
nervous system.

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:18.540
You can't escape your thoughts.

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:20.190
Surgery is not going to work.

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:22.770
These are permanent pathways.

00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:26.195
Doesn't sound that good, right?

00:38:26.195 --> 00:38:27.570
And the harder
you try to fix it,

00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:30.650
your attention's on the
pathways, it makes it worse.

00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:31.990
So it is a solvable problem.

00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:34.870
But you have to first understand
the traditional ways of solving

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:37.669
it can't and don't work.

00:38:37.669 --> 00:38:39.460
So I'll just give you
couple of principles.

00:38:43.504 --> 00:38:45.170
So why is chronic
pain so hard to treat?

00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:50.090
Well, again, we're using
a structural intervention

00:38:50.090 --> 00:38:51.495
for a neurological problem.

00:38:51.495 --> 00:38:52.620
So we're treating symptoms.

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:54.280
We're not treating
the real cause.

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:57.709
We're doing surgery,
injections, medications.

00:38:57.709 --> 00:38:59.250
And what's fascinating
and disturbing

00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:01.560
both is that most
of interventions

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:05.550
we do for chronic pain have
been documented not to work.

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:07.750
There's no data supporting
epidurals for back pain.

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:11.340
There's no data supporting
facet rhizotomies for back pain.

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:12.370
We know about opioids.

00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:13.540
That's a big problem.

00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:16.290
So everything we do in the
medical profession right now

00:39:16.290 --> 00:39:18.190
has actually been
documented not to work,

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:20.370
including spine surgery.

00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:22.249
We don't have the
diagnosis correct.

00:39:22.249 --> 00:39:24.540
Even though that neuroscience
has shown us a diagnosis,

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:27.070
this has not penetrated
mainstream medical thinking.

00:39:28.942 --> 00:39:30.400
And the other
problem is that we've

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:33.790
been throwing simplistic
random solutions

00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:35.234
to a complicated problem.

00:39:35.234 --> 00:39:37.900
I know everybody in this room is
used to dealing with complexity

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:39.191
and trying to solve complexity.

00:39:39.191 --> 00:39:39.692
Right?

00:39:39.692 --> 00:39:41.190
I had a friend of
mine introduced me

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:42.150
to complexity theory.

00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:44.080
And I'll admit, I
only know the term.

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:45.560
But chronic pain's complicated.

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:48.730
There's multiple things
that affect chronic pain.

00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:51.510
So we're randomly throwing this
at it, throwing this at it,

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:52.630
and it can't work.

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:54.210
So it's like fighting
a forest fire.

00:39:54.210 --> 00:39:56.530
It takes multiple strategies
to contain this blaze.

00:39:56.530 --> 00:39:57.400
Right?

00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.680
A fire hose isn't
going to do it.

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:01.480
Bulldozers alone
aren't going to do it.

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:04.170
This is a multi-pronged
approach to solve it.

00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:05.320
And everything counts.

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:11.560
So what happens with
this relentless thought

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:14.199
assault, routinely
adrenalized, we

00:40:14.199 --> 00:40:16.490
have these unpleasant thoughts,
the adrenalized nervous

00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:16.990
system--

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:21.150
and the two strategies
or two principles

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:23.358
behind solving the problem
is to simply de-adrenalize

00:40:23.358 --> 00:40:24.464
the nervous system.

00:40:24.464 --> 00:40:26.130
So everybody, just
sit back for a second

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:27.710
and drop your shoulders.

00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:30.170
Just feel the chair you're in.

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:31.720
That's it.

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:34.462
So what you've done is you've
simply switched sensory input.

00:40:34.462 --> 00:40:35.920
Instead of being
on racing thoughts

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:37.570
or unpleasant
sensations, you just

00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:38.830
went to a different sensation.

00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:40.205
That's it, three
to five seconds,

00:40:40.205 --> 00:40:43.120
I call it active meditation
to decrease the adrenaline

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:44.200
just a little bit.

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:46.060
You do it repetitively
throughout the day.

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:47.851
It keeps the adrenaline
levels coming down.

00:40:47.851 --> 00:40:49.630
It eventually becomes
somewhat automatic.

00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:51.920
I like to do it more as
my personal commitment.

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:54.260
And the other principle
is called neuroplasticity,

00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:55.635
which remember,
I said awareness,

00:40:55.635 --> 00:40:58.120
separation, redirecting, again,
like redirecting your river

00:40:58.120 --> 00:40:59.980
to a different channel.

00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:02.830
And that's awareness,
separation, reprogramming.

00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:05.470
And so that's the
second principle.

00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:07.210
The third one is shifting.

00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:09.080
So pain pathways are permanent.

00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:10.530
You can't solve them.

00:41:10.530 --> 00:41:12.280
So the [INAUDIBLE]
allows you to separate,

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:17.190
and then you redirect so you
can shift onto play pathways.

00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:21.660
And those of you in chronic
pain probably, I suspect,

00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:23.220
the life isn't
nearly as much fun

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:25.640
as it used to be before
you had chronic pain.

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:26.140
Right?

00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:28.000
It's a problem.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.090
So you can't solve chronic
pain because if you

00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:32.310
quit using those
pathways, they start

00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:34.520
to atrophy just like any skill.

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:37.170
If you start reinforcing the
creative, enjoyable pathways,

00:41:37.170 --> 00:41:38.562
they start to grow.

00:41:38.562 --> 00:41:40.770
At some tipping point, people
come off these pathways

00:41:40.770 --> 00:41:42.820
and go onto the
pleasant pathways.

00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:44.851
It's very, very consistent.

00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:50.700
So what we do, we tend to run
from pain. tend to fight it,

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:51.540
whatever.

00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:53.050
And the essence
of the problem is

00:41:53.050 --> 00:41:55.740
the more you fight and
try to treat chronic pain

00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:57.574
and just try to
conquer it-- again,

00:41:57.574 --> 00:41:58.740
it's a million-to-one ratio.

00:41:58.740 --> 00:41:59.499
You can't do it.

00:41:59.499 --> 00:42:01.540
You actually give it more
neurological attention.

00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:03.550
And it's a problem.

00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:06.190
So the essence of the solution
is becoming comfortable--

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:07.320
again, a learned skill--

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:10.260
with uncomfortable sensations,
whether they're thoughts,

00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:12.180
anxiety, anger.

00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:14.070
You've got to be OK being angry.

00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:16.110
You got to be OK being anxious.

00:42:16.110 --> 00:42:19.140
And you just train your
body just not to react.

00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:21.880
You notice, as you start
decreasing the adrenaline,

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:24.030
the body's nerve
conduction improves.

00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:25.950
So the anxiety
drops dramatically.

00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:28.560
That's the most fun part of
this process, by the way.

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:31.510
And then the pain
starts to improve.

00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:35.050
So we call this
the ring of fire.

00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:37.570
We're trained to avoid anxiety.

00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:40.350
So the red ring represents
anger, anxiety, disgust,

00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:41.555
vulnerability, et cetera.

00:42:41.555 --> 00:42:43.094
And we hate it.

00:42:43.094 --> 00:42:44.510
This is a survival
center feeling.

00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:47.020
So what we do is we
spend a lifetime trying

00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:51.010
to achieve, accomplish, own,
experience, whatever it is,

00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:54.550
to stay in this blue ring
to avoid the red ring.

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:57.749
So look at this when you go
home-- it's on the website--

00:42:57.749 --> 00:42:58.540
and think about it.

00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:01.132
I realized at one point,
I spent my entire life

00:43:01.132 --> 00:43:01.840
in the blue ring.

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:03.880
And I would touch the red
ring and pop right out

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:04.830
into the blue ring.

00:43:04.830 --> 00:43:07.080
I was so much in the blue
ring, I actually didn't even

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:08.690
know the red ring existed.

00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:12.070
So when I, by force, was forced
to go through the red ring

00:43:12.070 --> 00:43:14.980
into the center is you become
comfortable with uncomfortable

00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:19.780
feelings, where you end up is in
the green, which is the center,

00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:21.220
safe, content.

00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:24.140
And you're not
burning adrenaline.

00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:26.840
And I probably have triple the
energy I had in high school,

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:28.923
and I had plenty back then
because I'm not burning

00:43:28.923 --> 00:43:31.700
adrenaline all the time.

00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:33.440
So we're taught you
can have it all.

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:34.460
Right?

00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:36.560
We have all these opportunities.

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:40.010
And the problem is you
cannot run your mind.

00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:42.616
So what we are taught
to do is that we're

00:43:42.616 --> 00:43:44.240
trying to make
ourselves better people,

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:46.370
and it's like climbing
a huge mountain.

00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:49.370
At the top of this mountain,
there's a better you.

00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:50.810
And so you learn.

00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:51.820
You become enlightened.

00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:52.570
You meditate.

00:43:52.570 --> 00:43:55.170
You do mindfulness,
all this type of stuff,

00:43:55.170 --> 00:43:56.644
but there's no top
to the mountain.

00:43:56.644 --> 00:43:59.060
You tell me you have an ideal
picture of who you should be

00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:00.730
or could be in your
brain, and you're

00:44:00.730 --> 00:44:03.977
climbing and climbing and
climbing, but there's no top.

00:44:03.977 --> 00:44:05.810
So what you do, as
[INAUDIBLE],, if you just

00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:08.290
picture a bunch of balloons
tied to a railing, what

00:44:08.290 --> 00:44:11.900
the tools do, they
cut the strings.

00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:15.957
And pretty soon, you get to
take off, which takes no energy.

00:44:15.957 --> 00:44:16.790
And where do you go?

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:17.420
There's no place to go.

00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:18.711
You don't have to go any place.

00:44:18.711 --> 00:44:20.740
You're just there.

00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:23.410
And what happens, you
get to be creative again.

00:44:23.410 --> 00:44:26.600
Pain becomes sort
of a distant memory.

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:28.316
And you're free.

00:44:28.316 --> 00:44:31.430
So you can't solve chronic pain.

00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:33.830
These are permanent,
unconscious survival skills,

00:44:33.830 --> 00:44:37.247
but you can move into
a different realm.

00:44:37.247 --> 00:44:39.455
So the details are all in
my book, "Back in Control--

00:44:39.455 --> 00:44:41.379
a Surgeon's Roadmap
Out of Chronic Pain."

00:44:41.379 --> 00:44:43.670
And I learned this the hard
way, literally a millimeter

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:44.776
at a time.

00:44:44.776 --> 00:44:46.400
Then the website I
recommend, actually,

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:49.145
people hop on first and
just go to stage one.

00:44:49.145 --> 00:44:52.410
And you'll see a sequence that,
over the next six to 12 months,

00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:54.500
as you start walking
through this sequence,

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:56.950
it's not a fixing process.

00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:57.980
It's not a formula.

00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:00.100
It's not a one, two,
three, and you're fixed.

00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:04.460
But it's a set of concepts,
a framework, that breaks pain

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:06.170
into its different parts.

00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:09.230
It allows you to address
each part on your own terms.

00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:10.139
You take control.

00:45:10.139 --> 00:45:12.680
And there's some tipping points,
and then we go to pain-free.

00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:16.827
And it's very, very consistent.

00:45:16.827 --> 00:45:17.660
Thank you very much.

00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:18.800
Appreciate your time.

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:21.680
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:26.345
SACHIT EGAN: You have time
for a Q&amp;A, right, Dr. Hanscom?

00:45:26.345 --> 00:45:26.750
DAVID HANSCOM: Pardon?

00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:27.980
SACHIT EGAN: You have time
for a question and answer?

00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:28.835
DAVID HANSCOM: Absolutely.

00:45:28.835 --> 00:45:29.360
SACHIT EGAN: OK.

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:30.443
I'll just kick things off.

00:45:30.443 --> 00:45:31.645
I've got one from New York.

00:45:31.645 --> 00:45:32.975
DAVID HANSCOM: OK.

00:45:32.975 --> 00:45:35.391
SACHIT EGAN: And the question
is, "Does your approach work

00:45:35.391 --> 00:45:36.530
for all kinds of back pain?

00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:38.000
And if not, can
you give examples

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.489
where it doesn't work as well?"

00:45:39.489 --> 00:45:41.030
DAVID HANSCOM: So
we found out that--

00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:43.850
I used to think that surgical
lesions like spinal stenosis

00:45:43.850 --> 00:45:46.142
and bone spurs had to
have surgery to solve it.

00:45:46.142 --> 00:45:47.600
It turns out that
it doesn't matter

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:48.914
where the pain comes from.

00:45:48.914 --> 00:45:51.330
So if it's structural problem
or not a structural problem,

00:45:51.330 --> 00:45:52.080
it doesn't matter.

00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:54.890
So the answer is yes, it
works for any type of pain.

00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:58.804
What we do, though, we do what
we call a pre-hab process.

00:45:58.804 --> 00:46:00.470
And if you're my
patient, look, maybe we

00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:02.242
do surgery on your back.

00:46:02.242 --> 00:46:03.700
We're going to calm
you down first.

00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:05.640
And our outcomes have
been spectacular.

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:07.850
So yeah, the
solution-- so actually,

00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:10.820
now, almost 100 patients
that were on the schedule

00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:13.940
to have surgery, they came
in for their final visit,

00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:15.230
they canceled their surgery.

00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:16.505
The pain went away.

00:46:16.505 --> 00:46:18.130
So that has been
completely unexpected.

00:46:18.130 --> 00:46:20.850
So it's actually been
devastating to my practice.

00:46:20.850 --> 00:46:22.475
So it's a little
awkward at this point.

00:46:22.475 --> 00:46:23.849
SACHIT EGAN: That's
good to hear.

00:46:23.849 --> 00:46:25.380
I guess a follow-up
would be-- this

00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:28.470
is something that I
haven't asked you before.

00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:31.160
There's a certain level of
anxiety that's perhaps natural.

00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:33.980
It's not the kind that you
would go see a therapist for,

00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:35.686
that somebody would
say is abnormal.

00:46:35.686 --> 00:46:36.560
DAVID HANSCOM: Right.

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:38.851
SACHIT EGAN: At what point
do you have a patient maybe,

00:46:38.851 --> 00:46:42.920
and you might not want to do
surgery on them because they

00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:45.680
don't have a problem in their
spine that warrants surgery.

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:47.449
You can tell that
they're anxious,

00:46:47.449 --> 00:46:48.740
but it's an appropriate amount.

00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:50.281
Like, do you have
something you would

00:46:50.281 --> 00:46:51.890
say to those types of people?

00:46:51.890 --> 00:46:52.310
DAVID HANSCOM:
Well, first of all,

00:46:52.310 --> 00:46:54.360
if you didn't have
anxiety, you would die.

00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:56.420
So this is not about
getting rid of anxiety.

00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:58.080
It's not about
suppressing anxiety.

00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:00.430
It's being comfortable to
use the cues to actually take

00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:01.700
safe action.

00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:03.530
So I mean, there's
no definition of when

00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:05.060
anxiety becomes a problem.

00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:07.630
In other words, if
it's disruptive to you,

00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:08.540
then it's a problem.

00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:09.134
Right?

00:47:09.134 --> 00:47:11.300
So again, it's not trying
to solve it or control it.

00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:12.820
It's simply letting it go.

00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:15.320
And I talk about moving
forward with your pain, which

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:15.944
means anxiety.

00:47:15.944 --> 00:47:18.110
By the way, I didn't make
this clear in the lecture.

00:47:18.110 --> 00:47:20.485
Mental pain and physical pain
are processed the same way.

00:47:20.485 --> 00:47:21.950
Anxiety is the pain.

00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:22.827
OK?

00:47:22.827 --> 00:47:24.910
So you're not trying to
get rid of it or solve it.

00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:27.050
But as you quit
paying attention to it

00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:30.740
and trying to do battle with
it, it simply starts to atrophy.

00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:32.830
And so yeah, anxiety is
something that's life.

00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:33.704
Anger's part of life.

00:47:33.704 --> 00:47:35.280
You're not going
to get rid of that.

00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:36.238
SACHIT EGAN: Thank you.

00:47:38.456 --> 00:47:42.195
AUDIENCE: Hi, your
comments about adrenaline

00:47:42.195 --> 00:47:44.320
makes me reall curious,
because from my experience,

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:46.420
I've found that
adrenaline actually

00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:52.360
helps with the pain in the sense
that it washes it out or makes

00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:53.800
me forget about it.

00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:56.406
Is that because I'm on
the blue ring, let's say?

00:47:56.406 --> 00:47:57.258
DAVID HANSCOM: Yep.

00:47:57.258 --> 00:47:58.540
AUDIENCE: There you go.

00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:00.460
DAVID HANSCOM: But let
me talk about that.

00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:02.230
I mean, 20 years ago, I
had a patient come in who,

00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:03.438
we'd talk about this process.

00:48:03.438 --> 00:48:04.960
I didn't have a
project back then,

00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:06.220
but I had some
sense that there's

00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:07.310
some things going on here.

00:48:07.310 --> 00:48:08.814
So he was an
incredibly angry guy.

00:48:08.814 --> 00:48:09.730
Not that you're angry.

00:48:09.730 --> 00:48:10.240
I don't know you.

00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:12.200
But let's just take
perfectionism for a second.

00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:14.000
All of us have high
standards, right?

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.060
We think that's the
right thing to do.

00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:17.518
Well, the problem
is that genealogy

00:48:17.518 --> 00:48:19.867
of anger, where you have a
situation that you blame,

00:48:19.867 --> 00:48:21.700
that you're a victim,
and then you're angry.

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:24.540
So with perfectionism, which
is being self-critical,

00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:26.920
you have perfection which
you'll never achieve.

00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:29.370
So you're either unhappy with
the situation or yourself

00:48:29.370 --> 00:48:30.750
of being less than perfect.

00:48:30.750 --> 00:48:32.916
So you're always a victim,
you're always frustrated,

00:48:32.916 --> 00:48:34.972
and you're always
angry, frustrated.

00:48:34.972 --> 00:48:36.430
So Dr. Burns pointed
out the delta,

00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:38.620
or the difference
between reality

00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:40.886
and your vision of perfection--
sorry-- your vision

00:48:40.886 --> 00:48:44.240
of perfection and reality is how
unhappy you're going to become.

00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:45.620
So what happens
in that situation

00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:47.130
is you're always adrenalized.

00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:49.450
So what happens is, I used
to be quote, "successful."

00:48:49.450 --> 00:48:50.504
Right?

00:48:50.504 --> 00:48:52.420
I went to the top, top
level spine fellowship.

00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:54.772
I was successful, made
money, had a beautiful house.

00:48:54.772 --> 00:48:56.980
And the same adrenaline drug
that took me up the hill

00:48:56.980 --> 00:48:59.420
took me right down
the other side.

00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:02.870
It's hard to let go of because
we're used to adrenaline.

00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:05.540
It does quote, "make us
successful" on paper.

00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:07.130
I also have 19
medical colleagues

00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:08.600
who died from suicide.

00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:12.050
Doctors have double the suicide
rate of the average population.

00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:13.970
And suicide is not a
depression response.

00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:17.450
It's an anger response
because anger is destructive.

00:49:17.450 --> 00:49:20.840
The ultimate act of destruction
is self-destruction.

00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:24.396
So I can give you hundreds of
stories of most my colleagues,

00:49:24.396 --> 00:49:25.520
of people self-destructing.

00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:28.150
Is that successful?

00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:34.110
So yeah, you can get a lot done
with adrenaline, and we do.

00:49:34.110 --> 00:49:37.090
But does it give you a relaxing,
content, fulfilled life?

00:49:37.090 --> 00:49:38.422
That's the question.

00:49:38.422 --> 00:49:39.130
AUDIENCE: Got it.

00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:39.630
Thank you.

00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:44.040
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks, Doctor.

00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:46.290
I wanted to know-- so if,
let's say, a person has

00:49:46.290 --> 00:49:48.600
chronic pain, how to
they diagnose whether it

00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:51.180
is structurally or mentally.

00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:53.669
DAVID HANSCOM: So
again, this holds

00:49:53.669 --> 00:49:55.710
for all pain, migraine
headaches, whatever it is.

00:49:55.710 --> 00:49:58.680
So since I've taken
the pain project,

00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:00.420
I'm hyper about
doing the work-up.

00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:02.919
In other words, I'll make sure
it's not a tumor or infection

00:50:02.919 --> 00:50:04.450
or something
causing the problem.

00:50:04.450 --> 00:50:05.640
But what I'm seeing
with these patients

00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:08.160
with surgical problems, those
weren't structural problems.

00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:10.110
And historically, I would have
done surgery in a heartbeat,

00:50:10.110 --> 00:50:11.730
even by my
conservative standards.

00:50:11.730 --> 00:50:13.390
And they would have
done pretty well,

00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:14.820
but some of them wouldn't.

00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:17.070
So what happens-- I tease
my fellows about this--

00:50:17.070 --> 00:50:18.945
when was last time you
saw a surgical failure

00:50:18.945 --> 00:50:19.770
in my practice?

00:50:19.770 --> 00:50:20.910
And they don't.

00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:23.160
For elective surgery, we go
through this rehab process

00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:24.420
before surgery.

00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:26.770
Patients' outcomes
are spectacular.

00:50:26.770 --> 00:50:29.250
We have this whole group of
patients, even with bone spurs,

00:50:29.250 --> 00:50:31.140
that are cancelling the surgery
because their pain disappeared.

00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:33.181
It wasn't because they
were living with the pain.

00:50:33.181 --> 00:50:34.480
The pain actually disappeared.

00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:35.490
So I'm actually shocked.

00:50:35.490 --> 00:50:36.331
I had no idea.

00:50:36.331 --> 00:50:38.580
Every time that happens,
which happens every week now,

00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:39.460
I just shake my head.

00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:40.920
I'm going, what's going on?

00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:42.465
So it's been very interesting.

00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:48.860
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
coming to talk with us.

00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:50.780
I noticed that throughout
your presentation,

00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:52.250
at no point in
time you mentioned

00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:54.500
the idea of physical
therapy or any form

00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:55.790
of chiropractic intervention.

00:50:55.790 --> 00:50:56.480
DAVID HANSCOM: Right.

00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:58.640
AUDIENCE: I'm a big supporter
of Dr. Stuart McGill,

00:50:58.640 --> 00:50:59.510
and I've read most of his--

00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:00.020
DAVID HANSCOM: Who?

00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:00.950
AUDIENCE: Dr. Stuart McGill.

00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:01.400
DAVID HANSCOM: Yeah.

00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:02.810
AUDIENCE: Yeah, and so I've
read most of his major works,

00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:05.350
and he's very much so on
supporting and stabilizing

00:51:05.350 --> 00:51:06.020
the spine--

00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:06.440
DAVID HANSCOM: Right.

00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:07.760
AUDIENCE: --and just
getting comfortable

00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:09.926
in certain positions, and
then expanding from there.

00:51:09.926 --> 00:51:11.900
I was curious on your
thoughts on his work,

00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:15.520
and why you haven't been a
proponent of physical therapy.

00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:16.520
DAVID HANSCOM: Oh, I am.

00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:18.350
So I've picked up the
forest fire section.

00:51:18.350 --> 00:51:20.309
Normally, when I give
this talk-- my goal today

00:51:20.309 --> 00:51:22.808
is to create this paradigm shift
that you can heal yourself.

00:51:22.808 --> 00:51:23.930
I hope that came through.

00:51:23.930 --> 00:51:25.790
So it turns out that you have
to address all your variables

00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:28.060
at once with sleep, stress,
medication management,

00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:30.117
but physical condition is huge.

00:51:30.117 --> 00:51:31.700
So I'm a proponent
of the weight room.

00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:34.580
I like acupuncture,
chiropractic, physical therapy.

00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:36.830
It's been a wonderful thing
for my physical therapists

00:51:36.830 --> 00:51:39.590
because they do their thing,
but the book and the process

00:51:39.590 --> 00:51:41.880
takes care of the sleep,
the stress, whatever it is.

00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:44.360
So no, physical therapy is
a huge part of the deal.

00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:47.420
Remember, everything works
in chronic pain a little bit,

00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:49.430
but nothing works by itself.

00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:51.580
So sleep could be 25%-30%.

00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:53.711
Stress management
could be another 30%.

00:51:53.711 --> 00:51:55.460
Physical therapy could
be another 20%-25%.

00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:58.457
So when you start adding
these things together,

00:51:58.457 --> 00:51:59.540
it makes a big difference.

00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:01.090
So you're in good
physical shape.

00:52:01.090 --> 00:52:02.470
So physical therapy,
probably for you,

00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:04.180
is not as important as
some of these other things

00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:05.960
that people who are
grossly out of shape.

00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:08.800
So everybody has different,
I use the word "formula,"

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:10.750
because everybody is different.

00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:12.470
So by definition,
if you're unique,

00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:15.350
and I'm unique, which we
are, then the only person

00:52:15.350 --> 00:52:17.950
who can solve my problem
is going to be me.

00:52:17.950 --> 00:52:19.284
I can't get inside your brain.

00:52:19.284 --> 00:52:20.700
So yeah, the
physical conditioning

00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:22.510
is a huge, huge
factor in this thing.

00:52:22.510 --> 00:52:23.790
And that's all in the book.

00:52:23.790 --> 00:52:24.650
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:25.483
DAVID HANSCOM: Yeah.

00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:29.370
AUDIENCE: Thanks so
much for your talk.

00:52:29.370 --> 00:52:33.280
I can confirm that taking
stress out of your life

00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:34.480
gets rid of chronic pain.

00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:36.270
I had lower back pain for years.

00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:39.580
And once I started taking
out a bit stress of my life

00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:43.960
and don't take work as
seriously, to a certain extent,

00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:44.680
really helped me.

00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:45.544
DAVID HANSCOM: Good.

00:52:45.544 --> 00:52:46.960
AUDIENCE: I have
a question around

00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:50.394
adrenalin because it's like--

00:52:50.394 --> 00:52:53.230
the talk about adrenaline
slightly confused me

00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:56.880
because what is the right
level of adrenaline?

00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:59.590
Or maybe, what's the
difference between adrenaline

00:52:59.590 --> 00:53:00.850
and dopamine?

00:53:00.850 --> 00:53:04.040
Because for example,
if I do a sport,

00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:06.790
I get an adrenaline rush, but
the outcome is successful.

00:53:06.790 --> 00:53:09.069
I mean, I have a dopamine rush.

00:53:09.069 --> 00:53:10.360
Like, what's the right balance?

00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:13.120
Because now I'm a bit
afraid to expose myself

00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:15.760
to too much adrenaline,
and so I don't

00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:17.020
know what the right level is.

00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:19.630
DAVID HANSCOM: So I wish
I had more time here.

00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:22.030
My wife and I do workshops
together over a three or four

00:53:22.030 --> 00:53:22.550
day period of time.

00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:24.466
By the way, we're doing
a workshop in New York

00:53:24.466 --> 00:53:27.040
this June 29 through July
1, a three-day workshop.

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:28.844
It'll be on my
website here shortly.

00:53:28.844 --> 00:53:30.760
The reality is we don't
really know the answer

00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:31.970
to that question.

00:53:31.970 --> 00:53:33.820
And so the goal
here isn't trying

00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:35.110
to control things around you.

00:53:35.110 --> 00:53:36.735
In other words, I
put that ring of fire

00:53:36.735 --> 00:53:38.290
out there because
what happens, you

00:53:38.290 --> 00:53:40.270
become comfortable going back
and forth through the rings.

00:53:40.270 --> 00:53:42.210
So the amount of
adrenaline doesn't matter.

00:53:42.210 --> 00:53:44.830
So I probably have five
times the stress on my plate

00:53:44.830 --> 00:53:48.050
right now than I had when
I broke 20 years ago.

00:53:48.050 --> 00:53:49.960
So what happens is you
just train your brain

00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:51.415
not to be adrenalized
when you deal with stress.

00:53:51.415 --> 00:53:53.110
Because remember,
stress, by definition,

00:53:53.110 --> 00:53:56.020
is a threat, which
is always adrenaline.

00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:58.696
Otherwise, it wouldn't
be stress, right?

00:53:58.696 --> 00:54:00.070
So what you do is
a lot of things

00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:01.360
that we perceive as stress--

00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:03.400
stress, which our
thoughts are, a lot of it

00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:04.620
is perceived stress--

00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:07.470
you start training your brain
just to have less adrenaline.

00:54:07.470 --> 00:54:10.420
And so you quit avoiding stress.

00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:12.540
You really can just
process almost anything.

00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:13.390
And I fail.

00:54:13.390 --> 00:54:15.760
We have some pretty
bad weeks and stuff.

00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:18.370
So I always tell my patients,
learn how to fail well,

00:54:18.370 --> 00:54:19.912
because these pathways
are permanent.

00:54:19.912 --> 00:54:21.494
You're always going
to be adrenalized.

00:54:21.494 --> 00:54:23.080
You always kick
these things back up.

00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:25.900
But you just process them more
quickly and more efficiently.

00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:27.690
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:54:27.690 --> 00:54:31.130
DAVID HANSCOM: I guess
one last question?

00:54:31.130 --> 00:54:33.290
AUDIENCE: Going back
to the physical side,

00:54:33.290 --> 00:54:35.780
if you are working on
your back, whether it

00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:38.180
be massage or physical
activity, anything

00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:39.770
in particular that
you do recommend,

00:54:39.770 --> 00:54:42.080
either massage-wise
or specific exercises

00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:43.440
to strengthen the back?

00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:44.460
DAVID HANSCOM: Yeah,
I like them both.

00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:45.860
I mean, I think that
things like massage,

00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:47.590
for instance, gives you a
different set of sensations.

00:54:47.590 --> 00:54:50.420
So I think there's, first of
all, a relaxation effect which

00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:51.770
decreases the adrenaline.

00:54:51.770 --> 00:54:54.230
But you're also substituting
the neurological impulses

00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:56.480
on the part of the
body that's painful.

00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:57.680
I love the weight room.

00:54:57.680 --> 00:54:59.800
Obviously strengthening
and conditioning helps.

00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:02.660
It also gives you a mental
approach that's proactive,

00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:03.327
pushing weights.

00:55:03.327 --> 00:55:04.826
But also, I think
what you're doing,

00:55:04.826 --> 00:55:07.100
you're substituting,
again, different impulses

00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:09.135
from that part of the
body than pain impulses.

00:55:09.135 --> 00:55:10.760
So the weight room
to me is a big deal,

00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:13.080
Pilates is a big deal.

00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:15.700
So all those things
become somatic tools.

00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:17.450
That's what our workshops
are, by the way,

00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:20.450
are somatic workshops,
connecting thoughts

00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:21.840
with physical sensations.

00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:23.870
I think that exercise is
one way of substituting

00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:26.777
different sensations
from the pain sensations.

00:55:26.777 --> 00:55:27.610
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:55:27.610 --> 00:55:28.620
DAVID HANSCOM: Yeah.

00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:30.020
Sach, I guess that's it.

00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:31.220
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:32.770
So thank you.
