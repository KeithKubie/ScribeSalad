00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.682
- Mike isn't sure how to add 189 + 608,

00:00:04.682 --> 00:00:06.982
help Mike by choosing an addition problem

00:00:06.982 --> 00:00:10.650
that is the same as 189 + 608.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.287
Now let's look at these choices.

00:00:12.287 --> 00:00:15.722
Let's just start with this first choice,

00:00:15.722 --> 00:00:19.890
actually all of these choices start with having 1 hundred,

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.340
they all have 1 hundred, so where do we see 1 hundred here?

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.125
Well in 189, we have a 1 in the hundreds place,

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:30.966
so this right over here, that is one 1 hundred,

00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:35.284
100, and then all of the choices actually have 6 hundreds,

00:00:35.284 --> 00:00:38.894
6 hundreds, 6 hundreds, where are they getting that from?

00:00:38.894 --> 00:00:42.540
Well in 608, the 6 is in the hundreds,

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.385
so that 6, represents 6 hundreds,

00:00:45.385 --> 00:00:48.422
6 hundreds, so that's where they got the 1 hundred,

00:00:48.422 --> 00:00:51.943
and the 6 hundreds from, and then all of them have 8 tens,

00:00:51.943 --> 00:00:53.870
so they're actually all looking pretty similar,

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.564
up to that point, they all have 8 tens, 8 tens, 8 tens,

00:00:56.564 --> 00:00:57.992
where do they get that from?

00:00:57.992 --> 00:01:01.486
Well in 189, this 8 is in the tens place,

00:01:01.486 --> 00:01:04.702
so it represents 8 tens,

00:01:04.702 --> 00:01:08.103
8 tens, and then what else do they have?

00:01:08.103 --> 00:01:09.426
Well this is where they all start

00:01:09.427 --> 00:01:12.810
to be a little bit different, so let's go one by one.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.251
So this next one then has 9 ones,

00:01:17.251 --> 00:01:19.886
9 ones, where are they getting that from?

00:01:19.886 --> 00:01:23.822
Well in 189, the 9 is in the ones place,

00:01:23.822 --> 00:01:26.968
so it's reasonable to write 9 ones,

00:01:26.968 --> 00:01:30.509
and then finally, they have 8 ones.

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.228
8 ones, where do they get that from?

00:01:32.228 --> 00:01:35.547
Well in 608, the 8 is in the ones place,

00:01:35.547 --> 00:01:39.783
so it's 8 ones, so this first choice is looking quite good.

00:01:39.784 --> 00:01:40.783
Now you might be saying,

00:01:40.783 --> 00:01:43.630
'Okay, we took into account, all of these digits,

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.898
except for this 0 over here, how come we didn't,

00:01:45.898 --> 00:01:48.744
how come there's a 0 here in the tens place?'

00:01:48.745 --> 00:01:50.848
Well that would just be 0 tens,

00:01:50.848 --> 00:01:53.158
0 tens, which is just zero,

00:01:53.158 --> 00:01:55.133
so it's not going to change the value of this,

00:01:55.133 --> 00:01:57.464
so this first choice is indeed the same,

00:01:57.465 --> 00:02:00.762
as the original addition problem.

00:02:00.762 --> 00:02:04.100
If we want to see where the other ones break down,

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.570
this one has 8 tens written twice, we only have one,

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.721
we have an 8 tens here, but this 8 is in ones,

00:02:10.722 --> 00:02:13.683
so this should say 'ones', right over here,

00:02:13.683 --> 00:02:17.370
and this choice, we have the 8 ones,

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.360
but this 9 right over here, this is ones,

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.577
this isn't tens, so this should be 'ones'.

00:02:21.577 --> 00:02:23.899
So that's why we wouldn't pick either of those.

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:27.877
Let's do another one of these, or related type of problem.

00:02:27.877 --> 00:02:29.969
Which addition problem is the same as

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:33.939
525 + 379?

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:35.322
Let's just break it down.

00:02:35.322 --> 00:02:38.898
So we have a 5 in the hundreds place,

00:02:38.898 --> 00:02:41.555
so that would be 500,

00:02:41.556 --> 00:02:44.481
and then we have a 3 in the hundreds place,

00:02:44.481 --> 00:02:48.528
so + 300,

00:02:48.528 --> 00:02:51.738
then we have a 2 in the tens place,

00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:53.641
so it's two 10, or 20,

00:02:53.641 --> 00:02:56.542
and then we have a 7 in the tens place,

00:02:56.543 --> 00:03:01.408
so that's + 70, and then last but not least,

00:03:01.408 --> 00:03:05.660
we have a 5 in the ones place, so that's just going to be 5,

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.839
and then we have a 9 in the ones place,

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:10.299
so that's just going to be equal to 9.

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:11.438
So which of these choices

00:03:11.438 --> 00:03:14.259
is the same of what I just wrote over here?

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:19.530
500 + 300, so this first choice has no 500 or 300,

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:20.191
so we can rule that out.

00:03:20.191 --> 00:03:24.920
500 + 300 + 20 + 70 + 5 +9,

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.437
that's exactly what I wrote down.

00:03:26.437 --> 00:03:30.221
This last choice breaks down, they wrote 90 instead of 9,

00:03:30.221 --> 00:03:33.797
and then they wrote 5, and then they wrote 7, instead of 70.

00:03:33.797 --> 00:03:37.859
That 7 is in the tens place, it's not in the ones place,

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.770
we ruled that one out as well.
