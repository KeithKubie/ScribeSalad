And as you can hear outside,
there is some books for sale

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.880
and some folks signing those books.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.350

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.130
[ Applause ]

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.170
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: Thank you
so much for that introduction

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.750
and thank you also for being here

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.220
for this panel called
Organizing Founders.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.880
It is my pleasure to be here with
old friends and with new friends.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.120
I just met Michael Datcher
today and so happy to meet him.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.420
I knew him through his work,
but I got an opportunity

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.490
to meet him in the flesh.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.110
And to my wintergreen
women, my beautiful sisters,

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.000
Toi Derricotte and Sharan Strange.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.010
It's just wonderful to be here.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.910
I'm Joanne Gabbin and
I'm the director

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.940 position:56%
of the Furious Flower Poetry Center.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.450
And, you know, I was sitting here I
was listening to Marita [phonetic]

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:11.440
and I was thinking I too am
old enough to have been touched

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:18.390
by not only Cave Canem, but
also the Black Arts Movement.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:25.730
In fact, the people who
nurtured me nurtured the people

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.550
who are the architects of
the Black Arts Movement.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.800
And I want to spend a moment
to just raise their names.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.010
Hoyt Fuller of the black world.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.110 position:56%
Gwendolyn Brooks, Margaret Burroughs

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.830
who was the founder
of the DuSable Museum.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:57.630
Sterling Brown who was the first
Poet Laureate of the District

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.680
of Columbia right here
in Washington, DC.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.700
And George Kent who was my mentor,
who is one of the finest scholars

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.410
of the last hundred
years who encouraged me

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:23.710
to study Gwendolyn Brooks and
Langston Hughes and Sterling Brown.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.040
So these were people who
nurtured the people we now know

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:35.470
as Sonja Sanchez and Haki
Madhubuti and Amiri Baraka

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.380
and Etheridge Knight and
the list goes on and on.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:45.160
But I want to get right into these
introductions so that you can hear

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:51.820
from these fabulous people, hear
their poetry, hear their comments

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.170
and then we want to have enough
time at the end to engage you

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.270
in a conversation with them.

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:08.280
Michael Datcher did his
undergraduate work at UC Berkeley

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.810
and his graduate work at
UCLA and UC Riverside.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:21.630
He also just completed
his PhD at UC Riverside.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.970
He is the author of the critically
acclaimed historical novel Americus

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.440
and he's also the author
of the bestseller,

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.090
New York Times bestseller
Raising Fences.

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:43.060
Fortunately that book has
film rights on it optioned

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.560
by actor Will Smith's
Overbrook Productions.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:54.420
He is the coeditor of Tough Love,
the Life and Death of Tupac Shakur.

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.220
He also has a play by
the name of Silence

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.850
which was commissioned
by the Getty Museum.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:08.180
He is the cohost of the weekly
public affairs news magazine

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:18.450
Beautiful Struggle that is heard
on 90.7 FM KPFK in Los Angeles.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.510
His writing is widely
anthologized, including appearances

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.080
in what makes a man
brown sugar, soul fires,

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.130
testimony, and another city.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:39.990
He has also curated and/or
participated in the Brooklyn Museum

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:45.240
of Art, the Museum of
Contemporary Art, the Hammer Museum

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.740
and other art institutions.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.630
We are especially interested in
hearing about the World Stage,

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.580
a literary organization

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:00.230
that sponsored the
Anansi Writers Workshop.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:05.510
So you will hear from him
first, let's welcome him.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:14.180
[ Applause ]

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.480
&gt;&gt; Michael Datcher: Thank
you all for being here

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:21.610
and supporting black
letters and black excellence.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.790
I'll begin my comments with
an excerpt from an interview

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.500
by the founder of the World
Stage, the cofounder Kamau Daaood

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.500
who was speaking about his
understanding of the role of poets

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.910
and poetry inside of communities.

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:40.840
Daaood is a veteran of
the Watch Writers Workshop

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:46.680
that you may have heard of as a
part of the Black Arts Movement.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.520
He was also a part of the
Pan-Afrikan Peoples Arkestra,

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:57.030
which was led by the great composer
and pianist Mr. Horace Tapscott.

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.360
He was the lead poet in
that particular organization

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.470
and this is the quote about
again the role of artists

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.580
and poets in communities.

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.520
Quote, I am a devout poet.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.160
I believe that right words offered

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.140
in the right way can be
music holding us together

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:22.770
when we can speak the language of
essence, we will be able to commune

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:27.400
in the space miles above
dogma in the confines

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.960
of individual traditions.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.950
And we can develop into
evolved human beings capable

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:39.640
of radiating profound love,
light and service to others.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:45.080
I believe wholeheartedly that
art in a community is noble work

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.250
that fosters beauty and
meaning into our lives,

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:52.380
that art is vital and necessary.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:56.190
I believe in the sacredness
of breathing.

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:59.930
I'll now read a poem developed
in that writing workshop

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:01.820
which meets every Wednesday night.

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:05.270
This poem is one of my own,
it's called the execution

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:11.130
of Michael Brown and
dot dot dot one.

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:17.870
Unarmed white men don't catch
gunfire from riffle armed cops,

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:22.010
instead their empty palms wave
and pick winning raffle tickets

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:24.160
from the policeman's ball.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:30.550
But black hands are magic, wallets
transform to firearms in the blink

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:32.440
of a whaling mother's eye,

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:37.830
in the enchanting flash
of a service revolver.

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:44.720
Black fingertips spin two 45's like
an old-school ballistic DJ flight

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:49.340
of hand too exquisite
for the veiled eye,

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:53.430 position:56%
only visible in the cold of silence.

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:59.650
But come Sunday pistols are
missing imaginary planks in the eye

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:01.850
of the beholder of the bash.

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:08.100
If you a speck in a brother's eye
it must be a glint from a handgun,

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:13.790
pluck it out, ask questions
later at the inquest.

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:18.890
Let his unborn son cross-examine
the city's executioner,

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:23.180
let the womb question the
state, the Constitution.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:31.960
Let his unborn son ask will black
magic make me disappear too.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:35.820
Ferguson is [inaudible],
a slave schooner

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.320
in a recycled Hennessey bottle.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:45.410 position:56%
Sails are raised hands of surrender,
a loaded badge finds him guilty

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:48.830
of harboring illegal dreams.

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:54.430
The bottle's waste constricts into
an hourglass meat grinder flips,

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:59.900
Michael Brown slides and tumbles
down a tunnel of no return.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:05.010
Time only moves backwards
when historians connect dots

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:12.970
like drunk demonologists or when
a sunken face mother whispers,

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:17.340
I wish the magic bullet
would've hit me too.

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.150
Thank you.

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:24.230
At the World Stage we try to
follow the spirit and dictates

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:27.210
of Mr. Kamau Daaood
who is our founder

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.380
and also his cofounder
Billy Higgins.

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:31.540
If you are jazz fan
you may know the name.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:35.660
Billy Higgins was the house
drummer in many ways for Blue Note,

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:40.350
the great jazz label here in New
York or Manhattan [inaudible],

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:45.240
around the way in New York
[inaudible] oftentimes.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:49.030
And so in many ways
we really are trying

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:51.640
to address the present
historical moment

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.740
and this also links us back
to the 1960's movement.

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:56.160
As we know that in this time

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:00.590
of really virulent
anti-blackness we can imagine,

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:04.900
if you can imagine animus scale as
Mel White does where there's kind

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.320
of a hierarchy of aliveness
or animus.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.970
At the very bottom there may
be a rock and then some algae

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:14.710
and the maybe a cat or a dog or
reverse if you're a dog person

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:16.730
on up, you know, to people.

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:20.840
And the lower part of the human
animus scale are probably black men

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.140
and black women.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:27.040
We have the least power to create
and produce change to alter this.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.750
And at the very top we
probably find white men.

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:32.730
And at the surface --
at the current level

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:36.060
of animus black folk
can be killed by someone

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:38.940
and the killer can
suffer no consequence

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.820
because our lives are devalued,
we have so little animus,

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:43.950
a little aliveness and respect

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:45.830
in this modern present
historical moment

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:49.500
that our lives are embodied
subjects don't matter enough

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:54.350
to even require the shooter,
the violator to go to prison

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:56.910
or to even have a trial oftentimes,

00:11:56.910 --> 00:12:00.070
which is really very
frustrating and ridiculous.

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:03.750
And so we believe that art can
make a change, art can change that.

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:07.190
Through art and through literature
in particular that we can use art

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:09.920
to elevate the animus of people.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.490
When you begin to tell your
own stories about your family,

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:14.260
about your mother,
about your mentors,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:18.820
about your children you write
yourself into existence.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:22.150
And the power of writing own
narrative imagine any bookstore,

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:26.110
a Barnes &amp; Noble or Borders or
Library of Congress when you

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:28.100
and you pour that book from a shelf

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:29.960
or all those books
are someone's stories.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.740
It could be a nonfiction narrative,
it could be a book of poetry,

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:34.580
it could be an imagine narrative.

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.380
What if you could tell
your own story?

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.550
What's implied about having so many
books in a library for example,

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:42.090
like ours here at the
Library of Congress is

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:45.360
that those lives were
worthy of documentation,

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.130
worthy of a of a memoir,
worthy of a book of poems.

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:51.740
What if black folks who
have a lower animus begin

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:54.630
to tell their own stories
and that's the power

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:56.780
of art we find in Los Angeles.

00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:00.670
When I got involved in 93 we began
to find creative ways to use art

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:02.820
to reach people in our
neighborhood, in our community.

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:06.120
So we would -- I live in
LA and we live right off

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.460
of Crenshaw Boulevard, there's a
neighborhood called Leimert Park,

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:12.270 position:56%
it's the center of black art and
political organizing in Los Angeles.

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:14.740
It's also, you know, it's a
black working poor neighborhood

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:17.710
so we have gangsters, many of
them, we have drug dealers,

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:20.720
many of them, we have black drama.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:24.140
So we would go every Friday night
in the beginning especially in 93,

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:29.740 position:56%
we'd go to a corner on 43rd off
Crenshaw with a few poets, a drummer

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:32.820
and a milk crate and we would
get up and we would do poetry,

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:35.750 position:56%
we called it guerilla as in G-U-E-R.

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:38.710
Guerilla poetry live, we
start playing our drums

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:41.460
and kicking our poetry on the
street of Crenshaw Boulevard.

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.350
And of course invariably we
would have a drug dealer come by,

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:47.720
this is in 93 when
crack was ramped in LA.

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:50.760
Who are you people they
would kind of sweat us,

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.570
but we would say we're poets,

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:55.980
we're beginning a poetry
workshop, please come.

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:59.580 position:56%
And over a course of months of doing
this they begin to actually come

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:02.220
to a writing workshop
featuring poets.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:07.010
So try to imagine in LA gangsters
and folks who are engaging

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:10.850
in underground illicit commerce
coming to your poetry workshop.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:17.290 position:56%
It was for us, it was a time to not
dehumanize and make enemies of those

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:19.480
who look like us because
oftentimes in black neighborhoods

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:23.660
who are drug dealers or the
gangers are the outsiders

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:24.960
for everyone in that neighborhood.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.540
So we try to find a way to
bring them inside the community

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.680
by using art and by using poetry.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:35.200
So we know the power of art
and poetry to transform lives.

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.930
And my own personal narrative,
I went to undergrad at Berkeley

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:41.570
and my mentors were June
Jordan and Barbara Christian,

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:44.200
the great scholar and theorist.

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.970
And I was in a very corporate track
as an undergraduate because I came

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:49.790
from a very, very poor family,
I wanted to go make money

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:52.220
for my family and I took as a lark,

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.720
as an elective I took
Jean Jordan's poetry

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:59.990
for the people course one semester
the same quarter I Dr. Christian's

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:01.370
course on literature.

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:05.120
And being in those courses
literally changed my entire view

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.580
of myself, but also life itself.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:09.170
One day Barbara turned to
me, I would go to her house

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:10.470
and she would send me to go buy rum

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:13.480
which is probably inappropriate,
but to go buy rum.

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.600
And we would go to her house
and we'd talk politics late

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.720
into night almost every
single weekend.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:22.200
And she turned to me one day
and she said, she shook me

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:28.680 position:56%
and she says Michael, you are going
to be somebody with such conviction,

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:34.130
with such a force, I mean she shook
me you're going to be somebody.

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.590
But I actually believed it myself.

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:40.340
I began to believe it
myself, so I know the power

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:41.690
of someone believing in you.

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:45.090
And you can believe in folks who
may be doing in your neighborhoods

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:47.840
that are not progressive
or productive,

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.130
but you can still find
a way to believe in them

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:51.430
if there's an access route.

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:54.480
And our access route
was art, it was poetry.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.360
At the World Stage we offer
a seven days of program.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:00.320
We have drumming, African drumming,
we have poetry, we have jazz,

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.770 position:56%
we have a jazz [inaudible] for kids,
we have -- it's a crazy program.

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:06.360
Go to the worldstage.org
for more information.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:10.070
And use these really inexpensive
five bucks per workshop

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:11.960
for like the top people
in the world.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:14.420
Marcellis comes through,
all those cats come through,

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.360
Pharoah Sanders is
always coming through.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.750
The biggest names in jazz
because we have Billy Higgins

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:22.040
as our founder come to the
World Stage and kick their work

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.270
and of course the poets as well.

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:27.890
As my time probably is wrapping up
here where's my -- how am I doing?

00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:29.190
We're doing great.

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:32.820
And so we believe in the
power and the efficacy of art

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:34.740
to actually impact neighborhoods.

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:37.380
Too often as we know when
there's a financial crisis,

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:41.680
when there's a budget constraint
what gets cut first, the arts?

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:46.680
That is a horrible shortsighted way
to approach living in a society.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.490
Because when you begin to take art

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:51.690
from neighborhoods you take
imagination from kids' lives.

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:53.670
Imagination from adults' lives.

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:58.390
When you lack imagination you go
to the lowest common denominator

00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:02.320
which is violence, which is
misogyny, which is homophobia,

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:05.500
which is trying to
imagine being a man

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.590
and a definition that's
this narrow right.

00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:12.770
It's not an expansiveness when
there is a lack of imagination.

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:16.610
So we believe that through art,
through jazz, through literature,

00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:18.770
through poetry, through
children being exposed

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:20.910
to poets in their everyday life.

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:22.580
If you can make for
children in particular,

00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:25.700
if you can make art
attractive or in our vernacular

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:27.760
if you can make art cool right.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:31.230
So we thought a lot about how do we
make art cool enough for a gangster

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:36.360 position:56%
to come to our workshop, for the guy
selling literally our corner crack

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:37.660
cocaine literally.

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:39.890
How do we make it cool enough
so we can get together?

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:42.190
So we begin to all wear
black leather jackets.

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:45.850
It was a small thing, we're
searching for straws right,

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:48.590
we're just -- let's all get
leather jackets and we'll go

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:50.350
out to the corner and
we'll kick our poetry.

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:53.570
I know very simplistic,
very kind of yeah,

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:56.640
not really sophisticated,
but it helped right.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.820
And so to be able to walk
and talk and be around folks

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:02.870
in the neighborhood who are just
open to us as other members living

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:06.410
in that neighborhood who happens
to do poetry it allowed poets

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:08.390
to have certain type of
respect in the neighborhood

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:12.160 position:56%
where we weren't getting shot, which
happened a bit in our neighborhood

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:15.770
or robbed, mugged or
approached to buy cocaine

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:18.330
from our fellow neighbors.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:22.500
But I'll say lastly in closing is
that if you can imagine a world

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:28.390 position:56%
as Dr. Edwards, one of my colleagues
has a great quote about her vision

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:32.770
for literature and
she says oftentimes

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:38.100
that as you relate
literature to imagination.

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.690
She says that, her
name is Dr. Edwards,

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:43.030
she says literature is a repository

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:46.620
for conscious stories
and alternative visions.

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:50.430
Narrative is a dialogic site
for reimagining possibilities.

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:54.470 position:56%
So her whole goal was to try to find
a way to reimagine the possibility

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:57.320
for the drug dealer,
for the gangster,

00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.440
for the rolling 40's
Crip in our neighborhood.

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:04.250
And we thought our best route is to
use what we know best which is art

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:08.620
and to find a creative way to
make it cool, make it attractive,

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:11.690
but most importantly
make it excellence.

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:15.090
We found that when you write
in an excellent fashion.

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:17.090
[Inaudible] a rigorous workshop,

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:20.330
a component people
are going to feel it.

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:23.580
So in our workshop we have
an hour workshop first

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.910 position:56%
where people bring works in progress

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:28.660
in a very intense tough
resolve like environment.

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:30.850
Then we have a featured reader,
someone who has a book out

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:33.640
or famous poet comes into
town flies in for a half hour

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:35.260
and the last hour is an open mic.

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.190
But in that first part

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:41.100
of the workshop all the poets bring
their work first to the workshop

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.660
and get some very, very tough love.

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:46.360 position:56%
Even my poem I read today was a
workshop in that particular workshop

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:49.690
and I got lots of tough
love believe me all right.

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:53.500
Even today going to my own workshop
I am nervous climbing that stage

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:56.370
because people are
so -- I'm not joking.

00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:59.860
People are not playing and
if you come with a poem

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:05.840
that is offensively not
crafted people talk bad

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.550
about you and your parents.

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:09.510
Thanks for listening.

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:15.040
[ Applause ]

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.590
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: Well Michael,
we're not going to talk bad

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:19.250
about you, but we are going to
talk back at you because we want

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:21.890
to know more and so
save your questions

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:24.870
for the question and answer period.

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:27.620
You remind me of something

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:32.420
that Gwendolyn Brooks did
back in the late 60's.

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:35.640
She had a workshop with
a black peace donation.

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:36.940
&gt;&gt; Michael Datcher: That's right.

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:38.240
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: In Chicago.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.540
Yes indeed.

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:40.840
&gt;&gt; Michael Datcher: That's right.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.140
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: Next speaker.

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:47.610

the University of Tennessee, and now
she is teaching at Spelman College.

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:57.030
&gt;&gt; Michael Datcher: Nice.

00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:59.090
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: Her poems and
essays have appeared in journals

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:02.120
and anthologies, you
will find her everywhere

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:04.580
so I will not list all of those.

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:07.760
I will say here Sharan Strange.

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:09.560
&gt;&gt; Michael Datcher: Nice.

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:16.370
[ Applause ]

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:19.170
&gt;&gt; Sharan Strange: You
don't need to cut it short.

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:22.540
Thank you so much Joanne.

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:25.540
I love Joanne Gabbin.

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:30.800
Thank you so much to the Library
of Congress, to the Folger.

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:36.830
Good to be back in DC I lived
here for many years and I miss it.

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:40.480
I miss the DC that I
lived in I should say,

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.780
you all know what I mean.

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:45.870
But anyway, it's so wonderful to
be here and to see old friends

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:51.530
and new friends and just to be able
to have this opportunity to talk

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:54.030
about the Dark Room Collective
and there's so much to say

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:58.020
that I couldn't possibly say it
in 10 minutes, but I have notes

00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:01.370
so that I can try to
get in as much as I can.

00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:06.250
We were asked to share a meaningful
poem or quote or prose excerpt

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:10.540
as some kind of an epigraph for
our presentation and it was hard

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:12.240
for me to choose just one.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:16.830
So I'm going to share a few brief
things without comment and trust

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:18.290
that you will see how they relate

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:22.460
to my remarks today
about the Dark Room.

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:25.040
I wanted to read this
Gwendolyn Brooks poem

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:28.270
and I think it might take a little
too long so I won't read it,

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:31.890
but I'll just for those of you
who are familiar with the poem

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:36.700
that I feel that it is fitting
for what I wanted to share today.

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:39.000
And actually if there's
time later maybe I will,

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.380
it's called A Boy Died in my Alley.

00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:53.370 position:56%
But instead I'm going to share Young
Soul by Amiri Baraka and of course,

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:57.590
you'll hear the echoes of
Brooks in these opening lines.

00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:08.260
First feel then feel then read
or read then feel then fall

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:11.700
or stand where you already are.

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:15.500
Think of yourself and
the other selves.

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:18.480
Think of your parents,
your mothers and sisters,

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:24.250
your bent slick father then
feel or fall on your knees

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:27.840
if nothing else will move you.

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:31.990
Then read and look deeply into
all matters come close to you.

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:37.610
City boys, countrymen make
some muscle in your head,

00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:41.510
but use the muscle in your heart.

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:48.050
[ Applause ]

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:53.840
And then I'll just read an
excerpt of his poem Ka Ba.

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.930
Our world is full of sound.

00:24:55.930 --> 00:25:01.000
Our world is more lovely than
anyone's though we suffer

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.960
and kill each other and
sometimes fail to walk the air.

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:10.710
We are beautiful people with
African imaginations full of masks

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:15.840
and dances and swelling chance with
African eyes and noses and arms.

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:20.600
Though we sprawl in great chains
in a place full of winters

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:23.150
when what we want is sun.

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:27.120
We have been captured and
we labor to make our getaway

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:30.810
into the ancient image,
into a new correspondence

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:33.780 position:56%
with ourselves and our black family.

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:35.760
We need magic now.

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:39.900
We need the spells to
raise up, return, destroy

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:45.210
and create what will
be the sacred word.

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:48.510
And finally, this brief
excerpt from Ruminations

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:52.470
and Reflections by Sonia Sanchez.

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:56.430
The most fundamental truth
to be told in any art form,

00:25:56.430 --> 00:26:01.210
as far as Blacks are concerned
is that America is killing us.

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:07.660
But we continue to live and
love and struggle and win.

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:11.840
I still believe that the age for
which we write is the age evolving

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:16.340
out of the dregs of the 20th
century into a more human age.

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:21.240
Therefore, I recognize that my
writing must serve a dual purpose.

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.860
It must be a clarion
call to the values

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:27.390
of change while it also
speaks to the beauty

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:30.510
of a non-exploitative age.

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:37.040
[ Applause ]

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:40.740 position:56%
With Black Lives Matter we come back
to the old and persistent framework

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:43.750
of black ontology in
the United States.

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:46.950
The glaring reminder of
what do boys characterize

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:49.310
as the Sisyphus syndrome.

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:52.400
It continues to be for
us a question of being

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:56.670
and nonbeing quite literally so.

00:26:56.670 --> 00:27:01.510
Not a matter of whether we exist,
but of how viable is that existence

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:05.910
if it is always framed by the
question of whether we ought to

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:10.290
and for how long and on
what contingent terms.

00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:14.290
Black Lives Matter extends
the implicit declaration

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:19.460
of our viability found in the
slogan, we shall overcome.

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:25.320
But it also worries that basic
presumption when the onus

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:30.940
of legitimizing that viability is
thrust onto us Blacks circling back

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:36.310
to the tropes of an earlier age
is chastened in our language even

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:40.910 position:56%
as we grapple with the continuing
onslaught of white racist aggression

00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:44.550
as the boulder comes down
upon our heads once more

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:48.250
and we push it up yet again.

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:53.800
We've moved from the solidity
authority of black power which said

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:59.780 position:56%
to us Blacks, no matter who else was
listening here it is and it is ours

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:05.470
and let us see what it has
wrought and might yet produce.

00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:09.310
Almost 30 years ago when a
small group of aspiring writers

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:10.680
and artists came together

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:15.100
in a project called the Dark
Room Collective we were operating

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:20.710
under the spell of a devotion to
black lives and voices and art cast

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:24.770
by those literary elders and
ancestors who had paved the way

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:29.930
with not just their works, but the
consciousness to be boldly in love

00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:34.360
with blackness and cognizant of
the social and political demands

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:40.010
of history and the contemporary
moment on black lives.

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:43.760
We meant the Dark Room to be a
space that celebrated the ways

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:48.830
in which we could be free of our
constrictions, meaning ourselves

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:51.340
and our audiences alike
in such a way

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:54.830
that at the very least we can begin
to see each other more clearly

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:57.330
and support the ground,

00:28:57.330 --> 00:29:01.700
a non-exploitative ground
upon which to relate.

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:07.460
A yearning toward total life, the
language we put to it borrowing

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:10.850
that phrase from Clarence Major.

00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:14.730
We didn't profess so much of
politics of blackness so much

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:18.240
as a politics of community
built on acknowledgment

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:21.440
of our literary forebears
and forging bonds

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.750
of generational dialogue
and mentorship.

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:29.380
As the official Dark Room
history goes James Baldwin's death

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:31.450 position:56%
or more specifically, our pilgrimage

00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:35.660
to his funeral was the
genesis of the Dark Room.

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:39.990
But Amiri Baraka really was the
prompt as it was he who urged us

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:42.450
to go to Baldwin's funeral.

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:46.060
In an essay I wrote many years ago

00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:50.870
for Mosaic Literary Magazine I
said this about that experience

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:53.290
of attending Baldwin's funeral.

00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:56.990
Our sorrow was suffused
with a kind of energy,

00:29:56.990 --> 00:30:02.000
a desire to make something positive
out of loss and so we resolved

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.080
that we wouldn't let another of our
literary elders get away from us.

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:10.830
In traditional black culture elders
are always teachers, role models.

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:13.250
Through his writings and
activism, his humanism

00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:15.740
and his vision Baldwin
had given us an example

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:18.210
of passionate engagement with life.

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:21.170
Like the reels of West
African culture he

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:23.070 position:56%
and other black writers bear witness

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:25.330
to our collective struggles
and survival.

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:29.560
And like countless other writers
before them they have made vital

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.720 position:56%
contributions to American literature

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:34.130
and the African-American
artistic tradition,

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:37.870
as well as the global
literary tradition.

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:41.130
We wanted to affirm the
sustaining value of the commitment

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:44.000
and acknowledge our debt to them.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.200
My housemate Thomas Sayers
Ellis and I began to make plans

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:51.380
to formally connect with and honor
other still living black writers

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:55.360
whom we dubbed our
living literary ancestors.

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:57.310
We were already involved
in a project

00:30:57.310 --> 00:31:00.470
of building an extensive library
of writings by black authors

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:03.300
of the diaspora, including
first editions

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:05.300
and out-of-print publications.

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:09.360
We had named it the Dark Room
a Collection of Black Writing

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:12.200
because it was housed in a
former photographing darkroom

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:15.660
on the third floor of the
old Victorian house we shared

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:17.970
with other artists and students.

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:20.440
The words were already
emblazoned on the door

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:25.470
and we liked the pun it provided
on a room full of black books.

00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:29.930
The metaphor of a darkroom was also
apt a place where images develop,

00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:35.950
brought forth in darkness
into light, incubator womb.

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:40.640
Only afterwards did we realize the
affinity with the dark tower named

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:43.220
after County Collins'
poem The Gathering

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:47.480
of Harlem Renaissance Artists
in A'Lelia Walker's salon.

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:51.530
So in truth and in many ways
unconsciously too we had tapped

00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:53.490
into a continuum of historical

00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:58.340
and contemporary experiential
energy rooted in a consciousness

00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:01.880
of the beauty of our existence
and the commitment to Harold

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.840
and take sustenance from it.

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.650
In terms of the Black Arts
Movement we have an ethos

00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:11.750 position:56%
of African centered consciousness
by which to dispel the misconception

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:14.480
of self, the psychic homelessness

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:19.350 position:56%
as philosopher Lewis Gordon puts it
concerning the existential condition

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:21.910
of Blacks in Western culture.

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:25.210
Here I think too of Baraka's
language in referring

00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:28.290
to the importance of the
image in black consciousness.

00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:33.160
He refers to having the integrity
of those captured Africans.

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:36.620
And also I think of Sonia
Sanchez's discussion of the artist

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:39.070
as a creator of social values.

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:42.810
So with the Black Arts Movement
we get this will and this sense

00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:49.310
of responsibility to create and
to create within a space of home.

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:52.100
So that became I think the
framework for how we thought

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:55.590
about the black literary
tradition in the Dark Room.

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:59.980
How the project became meaningful
to us in terms of placing ourselves

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:03.520
in relationship to the writers
who had paved the way for us

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:08.600
or as my cofounder colleague
Thomas put it, who we owed

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:11.830 position:56%
and how we could extend their reach.

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:14.740
In our mission and methods
we were emulating their ethos

00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:16.770
of fostering community.

00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:19.850
So for us the Dark Room reading
series had to be homegrown

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:23.080
and grassroots, so to speak,
independent of settings

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:24.680
such as academic institutions

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:28.030
of bookstores even
and initially it was.

00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:33.370
We held a series in our living
room, we opened the doors

00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:37.250
and invited the community in and
it was publicized pretty much

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:41.830
by word-of-mouth and small flyers
and later go-go style posters,

00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:46.350
which is an homage to
Thomas's DC background.

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:49.880
But we put them up all
around town in barbershops,

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:51.980
in libraries, in stores, etcetera.

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:55.150
In other words, we wanted
to have it in our home

00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:57.030
so that people could
feel comfortable,

00:33:57.030 --> 00:34:00.840 position:56%
they could feel at home in our home.

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:03.810
We acknowledged the
generational bonds of community

00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:07.770
by pairing elder establish
writers with emerging ones

00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:11.130
and through this we aim to
highlight the implicit dialogue

00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:14.230
between the two readers'
works as well.

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:17.970
This was important too because the
pairings were meant to acknowledge

00:34:17.970 --> 00:34:22.860
and promote too we hoped the
inherent mentorship of the elders

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:26.210
that we have within
Afrocentric tradition.

00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:29.090
Often the direct influence
of the elder writer's work

00:34:29.090 --> 00:34:31.300 position:56%
on the emerging writer was the basis

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:35.280
for pairing the two
in the reading series.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:39.090
Also significantly we
added elements as hallmarks

00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:43.150 position:56%
of a specific cultural understanding
of ourselves and our audience.

00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:47.740
As a matter of cultural
specificity we added a jazz band,

00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:49.920
the Roxbury Blues Aesthetic.

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:52.820
Roxbury along with
parts of Dorchester

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:56.510
and Mattapan being the heart
of Boston's black community.

00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:59.870
Along with incorporating music
into the series we displayed art

00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:04.850 position:56%
by local black artists, students,
as well as more established artists.

00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:07.800
Bringing us all together and
often sharing meals together

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:11.050
after the readings solidified
a sense of community,

00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:14.520
family even that happened
on both sides.

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:16.870
And I'm thinking now
specifically of the time

00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:20.620
that we hosted Ntozake Shange
at the Dark Room and she came

00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:24.890
in travel weary and went
straight upstairs to take a nap.

00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:27.210
But before she came to
town she had asked us

00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:31.750
to find an old friend whom she
wanted to drum at her reading.

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:35.320
She gave us one name, his
artist name that he'd been known

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:39.970
by way back in the day and my
cofounder colleague Janice Lowe,

00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:44.160
who is also a musician as well,
took on the task of finding him

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:48.620 position:56%
and it wasn't easy because we didn't
know whom to ask or where to look.

00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:50.980
But she found him and
that made us so happy

00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:54.370
because we didn't want
to let Ntozake down.

00:35:54.370 --> 00:35:57.980
And then several years later when
the collective had starting going

00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:00.520
on the road to read together
and forge connections

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:05.100
in other communities with other
tribes of writers we were invited

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:09.240
to read at the Painted Bride in
Philly in Ntozake's neighborhood

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:11.250
and she put us all up at her house

00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:13.710
and there must've been
at least five of us.

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:16.500
But she put us all up at her
house and she introduced us

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:18.510
to the Painted Bride audience.

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:21.060
And it was like this
beautiful moment of community

00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:24.030
and mentorship coming full circle.

00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:27.550
It was also wonderful to
be invited as a collective

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:31.680
to Furious Flower One in
1994 by Joanne Gabbin.

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:34.720
I remember the warmth
and enthusiasm.

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:36.520
Yes.

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:39.040
[ Applause ]

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:42.670
The warmth and enthusiasm of
that watershed event and again,

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:46.210
as with Baldwin's funeral, the
heady feeling of being participant

00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:49.420
or witness to this historic moment.

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:53.430
It also felt like being at a huge
black literary family reunion

00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:57.100 position:56%
where you reconnected with relatives
you hadn't seen for a long time

00:36:57.100 --> 00:37:01.580
or met cousins, aunts, uncles
you didn't know you had.

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:04.510
The Dark Room Collective was
given a place at the table

00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:08.570
with our literary elders, mentors
and other peers and it felt

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:10.530
like real affirmation of our work

00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:14.960
of creating literary community
and our voices as poets.

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:17.530
The conference was
dedicated to Gwendolyn Brooks,

00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:20.410
one of my literary
heroes and it turned

00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:22.720
out to be the last time
I saw her in person

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.830
and heard her read her
work before she died.

00:37:24.830 --> 00:37:31.960
One of the rituals we incorporated
into the collective readings

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:35.910
on the road was to open our
readings by sharing a poem

00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:40.650
by a literary ancestor or elder
before we read our own work.

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:44.850
I think of it now as a riff
on the pouring of libation.

00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:51.120
Again that acknowledgment
of who we O-W-E-D and O-D-E

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:52.860
if I can make ode a verb.

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:59.540
So I'll conclude with this response
to the question of what we see

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:03.130
as the value of our endeavors
or at least how I hope

00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:05.820
that our work will be recognized.

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:09.250
The Dark Room affirmed and
perpetuated the vital notion

00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:14.060 position:56%
of community among artists of color,
writers, visual artists, musicians,

00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:18.360
filmmakers, as well as the
enduring power and significance

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.620
of our cultural traditions.

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:23.980
We foster relationships among
artists across differences

00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:29.850
in career, status, generational
affiliation, geography, poetics.

00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:34.800
We advocated making room for more
voices, as many voices as possible

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.810
in the national literary landscape

00:38:36.810 --> 00:38:41.080
and particularly more room
for marginalized voices.

00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:44.700
And we especially supported
exploration and celebration

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:47.000
of the black literary tradition.

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:57.080 position:56%
Varied and multifaceted as it is and
we catalyzed others to do likewise.

00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:58.880
Thank you.

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:07.150
[ Applause ]

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:11.820
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: You know,
I do remember that in 1994

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:14.640
when they came as babies.

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:22.530
Can you imagine and they came
under the title fisted reading

00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:26.660
and if nothing else they were
channeling the Black Arts Movement

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:30.630
by fisted reading and look
what they have become.

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:35.640 position:56%
Sharan Strange, Thomas Sayers Ellis,

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:42.320
Kevin Young at Emory
curing a whole archive

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:44.270
down there and writing books.

00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:50.060
And Natasha Trethewey who
was the past Poet Laureate

00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:54.040
of the United States
and Major Jackson.

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:59.370
They were so young that I had
the nerve to title their section

00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:01.330
of the documentary the [inaudible].

00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:06.040
You remember that's
-- you were out there?

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.610
&gt;&gt; Sharan Strange: That
was so meaningful to us.

00:40:07.610 --> 00:40:10.940 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: You were out
there yeah and it was amazing to see

00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:13.320
and it's amazing to see the growth.

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:17.660
But now since we are all
as Eugene Redmond said,

00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:23.120
slipping into elderhood
we put the elder last.

00:40:24.350 --> 00:40:25.650
This amazing woman.

00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:36.320
Yes mam. This amazing woman Toi
Derricotte who is the author

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:39.290
of the Undertaker's Daughter

00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:44.810
and four earlier collections
including Captivity, Tender.

00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:50.290
Tender was the winner of the
1998 Patterson Poetry Prize.

00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:53.540
Her literary memoir,
the Black Notebooks,

00:40:53.540 --> 00:41:00.210
received the 1998 Anna Steele
Wolf Book Award for nonfiction

00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:03.430
and was a New York Times
notable book of the year.

00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:06.780
Her honors include so, so many,

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:09.880
I'm not going to list them all
you have some of them there.

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:16.300
But we know her as the cofounder
and mother of Cave Canem.

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:21.200
She'll tell you about how
Cave Canem came to be,

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.500
so I won't tell you that.

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:29.100
But I must say I was honored early
on to be on the organizing board

00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:32.020
of Cave Canem, to see it grow

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:35.970
for at least eight years
they kept me on the board.

00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:40.350
And I could see how
these young people.

00:41:40.350 --> 00:41:41.650
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] let you go.

00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:44.960
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: Who were
coming into Cave Canem

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:49.440
as fellows were leaving
with motivation,

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:53.440
were leaving with inspiration
to go on and do great things.

00:41:53.440 --> 00:42:00.720
And all you have to do is read the
list of books in poetry in America

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:02.020
and you will see their name.

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:07.510
So let's have a rousing applause
for our elder Toi Derricotte.

00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:23.510
[ Applause ]

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:27.840
&gt;&gt; Toi Derricotte: Oh
what a beautiful city,

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:37.710
oh what a beautiful city,
oh what a beautiful city,

00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:46.730
12 gates to the city, hallelujah.

00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:52.780
There's three gates in the
north, which way is the north?

00:42:52.780 --> 00:43:02.260
There's three gates in the south,
there's three gates in the east

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:06.200
and three gates to the west.

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:12.220
That makes 12 gates to
the city hallelujah.

00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:22.630
Come on oh, oh, oh what
a beautiful city, oh, oh,

00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:26.270
oh what a beautiful city.

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:36.700
Oh, oh, oh what a beautiful city
12 gates to the city hallelujah.

00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:41.920
Gates, these are the gates
and I think that, you know,

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:46.140
like Lead Belly in 1912
or whenever that was.

00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:52.270
For me as I get to be an
elder I'm really an elder,

00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:54.710
but not until my next book comes

00:43:54.710 --> 00:44:01.460
out which is called I
didn't -- oh wait a minute.

00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:06.940
I didn't know how to be, I
didn't enjoy being beautiful

00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:09.980
until I was an old woman.

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:13.160
So yeah I'm getting to that.

00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:20.540
But the older I get the more I
see this process as not a movement

00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:23.460
and by the way, when I
saw that we're listed

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:27.720
with the Black Arts
Movement I was like what,

00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:32.350
Cave Canem is on the same bill
as the Black Arts Movement

00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:33.940
like the Harlem Renaissance.

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:41.540 position:56%
It's like what, it's amazing because
certainly we didn't start out,

00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:45.590
you know, we just wanted
a few people to sit around

00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:48.710
and help each other
be poets, you know.

00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:55.950
But I see it more and more as I
get older as a circle and I see us

00:44:55.950 --> 00:45:04.790
as all 12 gates, you know,
gates to that circle.

00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:09.220
Maybe we're around Congo
Square, we're in New Orleans

00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:14.480
where all those slaves on Sunday
could get together and drum

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:17.890
and that was where
the music came from.

00:45:17.890 --> 00:45:20.580
They didn't necessarily
speak the same language,

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:23.090
but that communication.

00:45:23.090 --> 00:45:31.950
And so okay for me it started
really, it's all about love.

00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:39.400
It's about moving toward what
loves you and what you love,

00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:46.990 position:56%
that's what the journey is about
for me and figuring out who that is.

00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:53.130
And, you know, I didn't grow
up in Harlem or New York,

00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:58.220
I never read a black poet in
grade school, high school.

00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:02.260
I was in Detroit, we
were a factory town,

00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:06.450 position:56%
we were a middle-class black family.

00:46:06.450 --> 00:46:14.950
I had a hamburger with Langston
Hughes when I was 15 years old.

00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:19.530
I didn't know who Langston
Hughes was.

00:46:19.530 --> 00:46:24.500
Oliver LaGrone who was a sculptor
in Detroit I became his friend,

00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:27.900
his daughter, Joy LaGrone,
arrived from where --

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:33.170
she had run away from home when
she was 14 and came back to Detroit

00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:36.430
with the Flowers of Evil
under one arm and high heels

00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:39.750
on and she looked gorgeous.

00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:43.850
And we became close friends
and Langston used to stay

00:46:43.850 --> 00:46:46.430
at Oliver's house when
he came in town.

00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:50.260
And I just remember Joy and I were
like this we've got to get going,

00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:52.410
we got to get out on
the street, you know,

00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:58.120
and it was beatnik
time for us, you know.

00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:01.480
And Oliver made us hamburgers
and Langston and we --

00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:05.030
I just remember very clearly
that he liked whole-wheat bread

00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:07.450
because he said that
was really healthy.

00:47:07.450 --> 00:47:11.280
And, you know, in Detroit we
didn't know from whole-wheat bread

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:14.960
at the time, you u know, so I
really paid attention to that.

00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:19.510
You know, so but that
was mystical for me okay,

00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:24.030
somebody touches your
life boom, you know,

00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:27.060 position:56%
you don't have to know, it happened.

00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:37.650 position:56%
And then so on from there, you know,
there was Billie Holiday, you know,

00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:42.340
I'm 14 years old and I'm
wondering if I'm the only person

00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:45.120
in my universe, you
know, for those 14 years

00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:47.810 position:56%
and then I hear Billie Holiday sing.

00:47:47.810 --> 00:47:51.810
And I say there's somebody out
there that speaks my language.

00:47:51.810 --> 00:47:58.300 position:56%
I'm not alone, I mean she was Billie
Holiday on a record, but I knew,

00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:02.400
you know, if I just kept
looking there'd be somebody

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:04.690
out there like Billie Holiday.

00:48:04.690 --> 00:48:09.290
And I looked for that all my
life and I found it, you know,

00:48:09.290 --> 00:48:15.900
especially in Cave Canem
because the circle.

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:19.250
Okay so just to tell you this
because we don't have forever,

00:48:19.250 --> 00:48:24.120
but the lives that have
touched me to get me

00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:28.260
to Cave Canem was getting --

00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:33.350
when I submitted my first book
getting an actual letter or note

00:48:33.350 --> 00:48:37.460
from Dudley Randall that
said, I really like your book,

00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:42.630
but I'm not publishing anymore,
send it Naomi Long Madgett.

00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:46.360
I was like what.

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:51.640 position:56%
Then, you know, sending it to Naomi
and Naomi not only accepted my book,

00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:58.790
but she was in a traffic accident
and in those days you set type,

00:48:58.790 --> 00:49:03.500
linotype or whatever
by hand and she was

00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:14.140
in traction setting my book
okay, that's Naomi Long Madgett.

00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:21.840
It was meeting Gwendolyn Brooks
and writing Gwendolyn Brooks

00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:24.070
and saying how good
it was to meet her

00:49:24.070 --> 00:49:28.490
and she wrote me back welcoming me

00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:34.450
into the poetry community,
Gwendolyn Brooks.

00:49:34.450 --> 00:49:40.840
Okay, I had a some kind of
an aunt she was the sister

00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:44.000
of my mother's second husband
and she's very beautiful,

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:50.250
Mary Jane Hewitt, and Maya,
Maya's not alive anymore,

00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:52.450
but she was Maya's best friend.

00:49:52.450 --> 00:49:56.420
And she came to stay with me and
she said, I'm going to take you

00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:59.430
to Maya Angelou's for
a cocktail party what.

00:49:59.430 --> 00:50:05.560
So I got this cocktail party and
I'm like hiding in the corner.

00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:14.710
There's Baraka there,
there's, you know, Haki,

00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:21.290
there's Raymond Patterson, there
are all these great writers

00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:27.240
that I had just, you know,
started to learn about in New York.

00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:32.590
And I was so shy and I remember
Baraka just like hey sister,

00:50:32.590 --> 00:50:37.050
you know, and he was so formidable,
you know, and scary to me.

00:50:37.050 --> 00:50:42.930
You know, because I don't
like to argue so, you know,

00:50:42.930 --> 00:50:47.840
just like okay please don't
yell at me or something.

00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:53.840
And he was so kind, truly
compassionate, you know,

00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:58.560
he was always that way on
a personal intimate level.

00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:02.990
He was just a compassionate
kind man.

00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:09.230
So Audrey Lord she was
my mentor, you know,

00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:11.550
when I was writing the
Black Notebooks and it was

00:51:11.550 --> 00:51:18.260
such a scary subject to explore,
you know, self-loathing and fear

00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:24.060
and stuff and relating it to
being a light-skinned black woman.

00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:26.350
Audrey Lord said, you
write that book girl,

00:51:26.350 --> 00:51:30.720
you know, do not be afraid.

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:38.190
And if you have one person, you
know, you can go forward, you know.

00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:42.320 position:56%
Etheridge Knight one time he came to
a reading I was doing at this dive

00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:49.150
in New York and he walked in with
Galway Kinnell and Robert Bly

00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:52.790
and I was the next reader.

00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:55.360
And I was like oh my
God I'm the next reader

00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:57.410
and there they are
sitting in the front row.

00:51:57.410 --> 00:52:00.390
And the guy before me Sean Ferrer
[assumed spelling] said I'm here

00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:02.890
to introduce Toi Derricotte,
but first I'm going

00:52:02.890 --> 00:52:05.020
to read a few of my poems.

00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:10.280
And he read for 45 minutes and
they got up and walked out.

00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:14.820 position:56%
But I did get to meet Etheridge
later, he used to come to New Jersey

00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:18.390
and hang out with my
friend, Madeline Bass

00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:24.390 position:56%
and was truly loving and kind to me.

00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:27.010
Nikki in my first reading
I won a little prize

00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:31.400
and I was the warmup act
for her at the new school.

00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:38.910
And she read Nikki-Rosa and,
you know, it changed my life.

00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:44.570
But the best thing I ever did with
Nikki Giovanni is played bidwiz

00:52:44.570 --> 00:52:48.640
because she's like, she's on that.

00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:53.430
I swear she's not here, I swear
I beat her at one hand I swear,

00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:55.770
but don't tell her I said that.

00:52:55.770 --> 00:53:01.930
And then the Dark Room
Collective invited me,

00:53:01.930 --> 00:53:07.650 position:56%
I said why are they inviting me,
you know, and you were so kind to me

00:53:07.650 --> 00:53:12.900
and you really understood my work
and really asked me questions

00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:16.400
that made me know these
people really studied it,

00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:17.700
they took it seriously.

00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:23.470
You know, I was like and of
course, Joanne and Wintergreen

00:53:23.470 --> 00:53:26.780
which I told her at the time
had shifted the universe

00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:31.460
because then there were all
kinds of black people there.

00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:37.030
It was like whoa there's so many
poets, different kinds of poets,

00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:38.330
you know, and how are we all going

00:53:38.330 --> 00:53:42.160
to get along, you know,
and everybody.

00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:49.770
So okay, so Cave Canem I've
got two minutes to tell you.

00:53:49.770 --> 00:53:53.300
I never read a black
poet in college.

00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:57.630
Whenever I would teach I
was always the only one.

00:53:57.630 --> 00:54:02.950
At a place I was teaching Squaw
Valley I met Cornelius Eady.

00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:09.000
We started talking about being
the only one, being marginalized

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.550
and what it felt like and what
it was doing to our writing.

00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:21.110
When I was at NYU in 1985 I told
Galway Kinnell that I was black.

00:54:21.110 --> 00:54:25.150 position:56%
I really hadn't said anything, you
know, in the big literature classes.

00:54:25.150 --> 00:54:31.030
Why would I tell anybody anyway,
but my counselor had also said

00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:33.350
when I said why haven't
we read any black people?

00:54:33.350 --> 00:54:38.460
He said because we
don't go down that low.

00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:41.240
So it was like these
are the kinds of things

00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:43.760
that just kind of barrage you.

00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:47.440
But only, I told Galway I said how
can we get some black people here

00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:50.540
and he said you think of something
and you come and tell me and I did.

00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:53.630
I said well I was teaching in
the poets in the school program,

00:54:53.630 --> 00:54:56.010
so I said can we bring
some high school students

00:54:56.010 --> 00:54:57.310
in during the summer.

00:54:57.310 --> 00:54:58.610
He said yeah sure.

00:54:58.610 --> 00:55:03.560
So we went and spoke to the
head of the English department

00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:06.940
and of course it didn't go, but
he really defended the program.

00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:09.680
But I had that in my mind.

00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:11.790
And then when I met Cornelius

00:55:11.790 --> 00:55:18.190
and Sarah we were doing
a workshop together

00:55:18.190 --> 00:55:21.430
and at the workshop I had
a few of my black students

00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:25.990
and the workshop went south
and the black students

00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:31.290
and the white students started to
sit in different parts of the room.

00:55:31.290 --> 00:55:35.560
And I remember walking into
that room and seeing Sarah

00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:38.510
and Cornelius walk over
to the black students.

00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:47.660
And I say yeah, these are my guys,
you know that trust was there.

00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:53.210
And then we started talking about
more things and we had a vacation

00:55:53.210 --> 00:55:55.640
that next year and when we were

00:55:55.640 --> 00:56:02.910
in Capri I asked him Cave
Canem was only an idea.

00:56:02.910 --> 00:56:10.080
If someone hadn't said yes it
would've still been an idea today.

00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:16.840
So it wasn't like a monument
it was just a tiny thing.

00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:20.500
When he said yes the ball started
rolling because then immediately

00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:22.610
where are we going
to have it, you know,

00:56:22.610 --> 00:56:24.010 position:56%
where are we going to get the money.

00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:26.440
Sarah said let's do it
out of our own pockets.

00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:29.630
I said where can we have it and
then I remembered my friend Father

00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:32.290
Francis had a monastery
and he said come on up

00:56:32.290 --> 00:56:34.780
to the monastery, call him Italy.

00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:41.540
You know, how mystical and
so that's what I want to talk

00:56:41.540 --> 00:56:46.210
about the mysticality of black
connections and the circle.

00:56:46.210 --> 00:56:48.010
Thank you.

00:56:48.010 --> 00:56:54.060
[ Applause ]

00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:55.360
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: Since
I'm on camera

00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:57.960
and I have this opportunity
I want to tell you

00:56:57.960 --> 00:57:00.830
where the seed was planted.

00:57:00.830 --> 00:57:05.990
The seed of the idea because
Toi called me two weeks

00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:13.110
after Furious Flower in 1994 and
she said, Joanne do you understand

00:57:13.110 --> 00:57:17.530
that these young people
stayed up all night

00:57:17.530 --> 00:57:21.420
in what was a Howard Johnson's
remember you told me that?

00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:25.410
Howard Johnson's hotel and they
were reading to one another

00:57:25.410 --> 00:57:27.280
and they were supporting
one another.

00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:28.580
&gt;&gt; Toi Derricotte:
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:57:28.580 --> 00:57:31.560
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: Yeah, yeah
and I want to document this.

00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:33.110
&gt;&gt; Toi Derricotte: yeah, yeah.

00:57:33.110 --> 00:57:36.590
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: And she
said we have to do something,

00:57:36.590 --> 00:57:41.890
we have to do something to
give these young people a forum

00:57:41.890 --> 00:57:45.790
in which they can talk to one
another about their poetry

00:57:45.790 --> 00:57:50.310
because it's not happening really
in some of our MFA programs.

00:57:50.310 --> 00:57:51.610
&gt;&gt; Toi Derricotte: Oh yeah.

00:57:51.610 --> 00:57:54.080
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: You said that
and we talked for about two hours

00:57:54.080 --> 00:58:00.890
and then in 1996, Cave
Canem is born.

00:58:00.890 --> 00:58:06.460
It wouldn't have happened
without Cornelius Eady and Sarah.

00:58:06.460 --> 00:58:07.760
&gt;&gt; Toi Derricotte: That's right.

00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:09.060
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: Micklem.

00:58:09.060 --> 00:58:10.360
&gt;&gt; Toi Derricotte: That's right.

00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:11.740
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: Who were
there in Italy to say yes,

00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:14.590
we can do this financially.

00:58:14.590 --> 00:58:18.420
But what was in her head.

00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:19.720
&gt;&gt; Toi Derricotte:
Working for a long time.

00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:21.900
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: Had been working
for a long time and she had sort

00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:26.990
of said, this is what we need
to do and it came to fruition.

00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:32.250
And so in 1998 when she asked me
to be on the board I reminded her

00:58:32.250 --> 00:58:35.060
that yeah, I was there
when it all started.

00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:36.970
&gt;&gt; Toi Derricotte: Well, you know,
and it's that too I just want

00:58:36.970 --> 00:58:43.950
to talk about, you know, who do
you go to talk about your ideas.

00:58:43.950 --> 00:58:49.690
Who helps you with your
vision, you know, and Joanne,

00:58:49.690 --> 00:58:52.760
if you ever need help
with your vision,

00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:55.200
what's your phone number Joanne?

00:58:56.420 --> 00:58:58.800
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: All right,
now you all get ready.

00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:05.880
In honor of Sonia Sanchez
who could not be here today

00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:10.820
because of a family issue we
have to remember that at the end

00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:13.900 position:56%
of every presentation she would say,

00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:16.270
especially after the
powerful presentations

00:59:16.270 --> 00:59:20.600
that we heard before this one
and these powerful presentations

00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:26.480
of organization that in
this particular time we have

00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:36.440
to assume Rachel and Tony
an attitude of resistance

00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:39.080
and Marilyn's back
there and Marilyn.

00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:44.560
We have to assume an
attitude of resistance.

00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:46.390
So to get us ready

00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:49.310
for the question-and-answer
period I want you to say

00:59:49.310 --> 00:59:51.290
as Sonia would say, resist.

00:59:51.290 --> 00:59:52.590
&gt;&gt; Resist.

00:59:52.590 --> 00:59:53.890
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: Resist.

00:59:53.890 --> 00:59:55.190
&gt;&gt; Resist.

00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:56.490
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: Resist.

00:59:56.490 --> 00:59:57.790
&gt;&gt; Resist.

00:59:57.790 --> 00:59:59.090
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: Resist
and I want you to remember

00:59:59.090 --> 01:00:06.740
that Lucille Clifton would say,
every day something has tried

01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:11.900
to kill me, but has failed.

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:13.200
&gt;&gt; Michael Datcher: Right.

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:14.500
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: And
I want you to remember

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:22.680
that Gwendolyn Brooks would
say, we are our business,

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:29.990
we are our harvest and our bond.

01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:31.420
Wouldn't she say that?

01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:32.720
&gt;&gt; Michael Datcher: Indeed.

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:34.660
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: So in these times
we have to remember those things.

01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:39.080
We have to remember those
strong women who every day

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:43.680
through their poetry, through
their lives help us to keep going.

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:50.560
Another strong woman said Sharon in
this wonderful poem I'm just going

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:51.860
to read a little part of it.

01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:58.820 position:56%
In praise of wisdom that was written
in homage to Gwendolyn Brooks

01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:05.160
and it ends like this, with
untamed hunger for the harvest,

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:14.270
unafraid of no astute aboriginal
who penetrates still the chaos

01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:19.300
and them clamor, who
crafts our mutual estate.

01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:26.740
What I want to start with is
I want each of you to look

01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:34.000
at what is this harvest that
you see that we can reap now.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:39.330
Even now when our country seems
to be more embroiled than ever

01:01:39.330 --> 01:01:44.100
in the chaos of dysfunctional
politics and the clamor

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:53.590 position:56%
of the unjust and hate filled
people what is it that poetry can do

01:01:53.590 --> 01:02:00.740
in honor of the resistance that
we have been taught by people

01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:06.860
like Sonia Sanchez and Nikki
Giovanni and Amiri Baraka

01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:11.150
and Etheridge Knight
and Haki Madhubuti.

01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:14.770
What is it, what is the harvest?

01:02:14.770 --> 01:02:19.520
And I know -- that was my last
question, but you all did so well

01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:23.520
in your presentations I don't have
to ask the first few questions.

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:26.390
I want to start with that and
then I want you all to get ready.

01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:27.690
&gt;&gt; Michael Datcher: I'll start.

01:02:27.690 --> 01:02:31.450
I just want to comment
-- echo Toi's comment

01:02:31.450 --> 01:02:32.750
that it's all about the love.

01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:35.260
I was thinking about the earlier
panel and then our panel tonight

01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:39.940
as people were commenting
upon folks we impacted them.

01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:43.600
Toi talked about Langston Hughes,
Sharon talked about Shange,

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:46.660
I talked about Barbara Christian,
Tony talked about [inaudible]

01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:49.250
and then Miss Nelson talked
about Etheridge Knight.

01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:55.660
We have all been impacted by people
who loved us enough to make a stand

01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:58.570
for us, to reach out
to us, to do something

01:02:58.570 --> 01:03:00.480
and to take some action, you know.

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:04.820 position:56%
Love for me is a verb it's an action
word and the folks in our lives

01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:08.690
who were mentors, folks who
took their busy time to reach

01:03:08.690 --> 01:03:10.560
out to those who were
not quite as developed,

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:13.400
not quite as well-known
or even talented.

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:17.580
But they loved us enough to do
something and that to me seems

01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:21.790
to be how we create, expand
and harvest that which is

01:03:21.790 --> 01:03:27.930
out here is us deciding to be that
mentor, that concerned citizen,

01:03:27.930 --> 01:03:32.050
that concerned neighbor and to
love ourselves enough to love those

01:03:32.050 --> 01:03:34.840
who look like us and those
who don't, but who are allies

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:39.210
to reach a helping hand in the
spirit of love and in fellowship.

01:03:39.210 --> 01:03:40.510
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: Beautiful.

01:03:40.510 --> 01:03:41.810
Yeah Sharon.

01:03:41.810 --> 01:03:46.300
&gt;&gt; Sharan Strange: I like to talk
to my students about the notion

01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:50.860 position:56%
of bearing witness that that's what
art does right, that's the function.

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:55.050
And what to bear witness
though sometimes

01:03:55.050 --> 01:03:59.280
as Brooks again, I'll quote Brooks.

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:04.290
That art urges right,
it urges voyages,

01:04:04.290 --> 01:04:07.720
but also it hurts she
says art hurts.

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:14.800
And so you have to be open and
courageous in terms of that process

01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:18.250
of bearing witness and so
when you said the harvest,

01:04:18.250 --> 01:04:21.250
I was like the harvest
like you said, it's love

01:04:21.250 --> 01:04:28.090
but it's the heart right, it's not
losing connection with the heart

01:04:28.090 --> 01:04:32.040
and even when it's painful.

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:37.290
We have to be courageous enough to
remain vulnerable to one another

01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:43.510
in our barest most elemental
state of being human.

01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:45.060
&gt;&gt; Michael Datcher: That's right.

01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:47.900
&gt;&gt; Sharan Strange: Because if we
lose that we've lost everything

01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:51.720
and I think that's the problem

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:55.370
that the oppressor has
yet to recognize right.

01:04:55.370 --> 01:05:02.290
That they've lost something most
fundamental no matter how powerful

01:05:02.290 --> 01:05:04.720
they may seem, no matter
how powerful

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:07.850 position:56%
and enduring their systems may seem.

01:05:07.850 --> 01:05:14.210
And so we bear that responsibility
as artists in giving witness,

01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:16.900
but we also expose ourselves

01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:22.250
in the most frightening
ways, you know, to that hurt.

01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:27.650
But it's that basis of
connection as well because empathy

01:05:27.650 --> 01:05:30.600
without empathy right,
there is no love.

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:31.960
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: That's right.

01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:34.860 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sharan Strange: And so I think we
have to keep that ever most in mind

01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:37.840
that the real harvest
is love as you said,

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:40.720
but the path to that is empathy.

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:43.510
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: Beautiful,
beautiful.

01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:48.160
[ Applause ]

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:52.050
&gt;&gt; Toi Derricotte: I think
for me I was thinking why now,

01:05:52.050 --> 01:06:05.410
why are these great poets writing
all these books and why this fury

01:06:05.410 --> 01:06:10.710
of desire to write and
write poetry and articulate.

01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:14.940
This certainly wasn't
felt in my growing up.

01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:19.460
I had a friend, a white friend,
a very close friend we were

01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:26.350
at a coffee shop and
there was a canister

01:06:26.350 --> 01:06:30.800
of biscotti clear on the counter.

01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:42.170
And I ordered my cortado and I was
standing looking at the barista

01:06:42.170 --> 01:06:48.380
and he was facing me
and I knew this barista,

01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:53.220
I knew this particular
barista was mean.

01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:55.840
And people were like scared of him.

01:06:55.840 --> 01:07:01.020
Have you ever met a barista, it's
like oh you might be scared to ask

01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:04.940
for a cup of coffee from him, you
know, like really give it to me.

01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:09.310
It was like you had to
pass a test or something.

01:07:09.310 --> 01:07:14.250 position:56%
And the friend, my white male
friend, as we were talking he turned

01:07:14.250 --> 01:07:22.990
around and opened the
canister of biscotti,

01:07:22.990 --> 01:07:25.820
pulled out a biscotti
and started eating it.

01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:30.560
And I was looking at
the face of the barista.

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:33.140
His face started to
go through this --

01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:37.300
I thought he was going to
bust, you know, his brain out.

01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:43.780
He was like and then I saw him
look at the man, the man's back

01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:48.350
and then he composed his face.

01:07:48.350 --> 01:07:53.610 position:56%
If that had been me he probably, you
know, he would have jumped all over.

01:07:53.610 --> 01:07:57.030
But he saw this was
a tall white man.

01:07:57.030 --> 01:08:00.280
So but what I want to
say is that I saw that

01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:05.840
and I think that's
double consciousness.

01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:11.380
He was totally not aware,
it could matter less to him.

01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:16.320
That man didn't matter what he got
his thing and that's how life is,

01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:18.740
you know, he gets his thing.

01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:21.340
But what I thought
is that, you know,

01:08:21.340 --> 01:08:29.110
women for many reasons some people
have to just walk around thinking,

01:08:29.110 --> 01:08:34.830
you know, can I get this thing
out of this jar or, you know,

01:08:34.830 --> 01:08:38.830
how am I going to get that
thing out of that jar.

01:08:38.830 --> 01:08:44.680
And it's really sad, but I
think the thing that's good

01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:50.460
about it is there's maybe a
complexity that I can go home

01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:51.980
and sit down and write about

01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:56.250
and maybe that's why
writing is important to me.

01:08:56.250 --> 01:09:02.690
Because I can look at things
and add dimensions that

01:09:02.690 --> 01:09:03.990
and I really think that's one

01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:08.400
of the reasons why black people
right now are writing these great

01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:11.470
things they're writing
because they're just looking

01:09:11.470 --> 01:09:15.680
at things from their ancestors.

01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:20.930
You know, they're carrying a vision
of a very complex American scene

01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:25.150
and that's coming out
in the work now.

01:09:25.150 --> 01:09:30.440
I think my mother had it, it's
nothing new that double vision,

01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:35.490
but for some reason and I really
don't know why the language

01:09:35.490 --> 01:09:39.810
and the poetry is there now
in a way it never was before.

01:09:39.810 --> 01:09:44.530 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sharan Strange: I was also just
going to add too in terms of talking

01:09:44.530 --> 01:09:48.640
about that harvest because I think
when we're talking about love,

01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:51.150
you know, we're talking about
it in the context of liberation.

01:09:51.150 --> 01:09:52.450
&gt;&gt; Michael Datcher: That's right.

01:09:52.450 --> 01:09:56.150
&gt;&gt; Sharan Strange: So I just wanted
to be clear that that's the context

01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:59.260
that I'm talking about and that
it's understood in that way

01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:05.260
so that we have more and
more writers producing

01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:06.560
and black writers producing.

01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:10.960
And it feels like there's something
even as the again, you know,

01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:14.390
that metaphor of the Sisyphus
syndrome, even as more

01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:17.180
and more comes down
upon our heads right,

01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:20.970
there's at the same time this kind
of opening up, I think this kind

01:10:20.970 --> 01:10:24.280
of bursting forth of this energy.

01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:28.920 position:56%
And, you know, so that
counterforce of the quest, the urge,

01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:33.300
the thrust for liberation
I think is that harvest.

01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:34.600
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: Yeah.

01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:36.350
&gt;&gt; Sharan Strange: Yeah
and that will free us all.

01:10:36.350 --> 01:10:39.650
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: Exactly
and there was that feeling

01:10:39.650 --> 01:10:45.230
in 1970 at Roosevelt University.

01:10:45.230 --> 01:10:50.170
I was a new PhD, no I
was a new PhD candidate,

01:10:50.170 --> 01:10:53.990
but I had just gotten my
Masters and they wanted someone

01:10:53.990 --> 01:11:00.300
to teach a course called
Revolutionary Black Consciousness

01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:02.680
and I signed on.

01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:07.500
And green out of the
University of Chicago.

01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:16.350
So three months in and I'm teaching
Black Fire edited by Amiri Baraka

01:11:16.350 --> 01:11:22.450
and Larry Neal and I'm Xeroxing
everything I can get my hands

01:11:22.450 --> 01:11:28.820
on just like Sonia did five
years before out in California.

01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:34.890
So I go get lunch at the faculty
cafeteria and so a colleague comes

01:11:34.890 --> 01:11:37.040
up to me and says, are you

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:42.140
that teacher whose teaching
the black literature course

01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:44.540
and I said yes.

01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:48.670
He said to me well, you know, we
almost got Gwendolyn Brooks to come

01:11:48.670 --> 01:11:53.950
to Roosevelt University and
I said whoa what happened,

01:11:53.950 --> 01:11:57.770
could you not pay her what
she wanted or whatever.

01:11:57.770 --> 01:12:02.820
And he said no, the
faculty turned her down.

01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:08.670
This was in 1970, she had
already won the Pulitzer,

01:12:08.670 --> 01:12:12.740
first African-American to
win the Pulitzer in 1950.

01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:18.090
And my heart sunk.

01:12:18.090 --> 01:12:23.480
I said I'm sitting in this
place, I'm speaking to students,

01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:27.100
25 or so students and she couldn't.

01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:33.110
So I made it up in my mind
that every time I transferred

01:12:33.110 --> 01:12:40.050
to a college or university I would
invite Gwendolyn Brooks to come.

01:12:40.050 --> 01:12:45.410
So that's why she went to
Chicago State and she read there.

01:12:45.410 --> 01:12:50.290
When I went to Lincoln University
I brought her there in 1977

01:12:50.290 --> 01:12:55.210
and we sat down, she and Dudley
Randall and [inaudible] roots.

01:12:55.210 --> 01:13:03.230
And in 1986 just one year after
I got to JMU she came again.

01:13:03.230 --> 01:13:09.030
So you can see how love, the
love that deals with liberation

01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:13.600
because I knew that was the
political act of slavery.

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:18.930 position:56%
They were keeping her in her place
even though this is a renowned woman

01:13:18.930 --> 01:13:22.690
and she was also poet
laureate of Illinois.

01:13:22.690 --> 01:13:28.110
So if any of you want to know
how Furious Flower happened,

01:13:28.110 --> 01:13:32.940
it was because I decided in 1993

01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:36.180
that I would invite her
[inaudible] one more time

01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:41.120
and she said she wouldn't come in
1993, but she would come in 94.

01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:42.420
&gt;&gt; Toi Derricotte: Oh I remember.

01:13:42.420 --> 01:13:46.970
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: So what happened,
all these people just said okay

01:13:46.970 --> 01:13:50.890
if Gwendolyn Brooks is
coming I want to be there.

01:13:50.890 --> 01:13:56.600 position:56%
So the young people Sharon and Major
and Kevin and the older people,

01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:58.290
Eugene and Michael Harper.

01:13:58.290 --> 01:14:01.300
In fact, Michael Harper rest

01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:06.670
in peace Michael is the one
we've most recently lost.

01:14:06.670 --> 01:14:10.590
He says Joanne, what
are you trying to do,

01:14:10.590 --> 01:14:12.560
set off a cannon or something.

01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:15.120
You're going to have all
these people who don't

01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:17.050
like each other coming together.

01:14:17.050 --> 01:14:21.590
I said Michael this is
about the love the poetry,

01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:25.310
this is about the love of people
being free, this is about the love

01:14:25.310 --> 01:14:28.100
of people mentoring other people.

01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:30.900
And what do we when we
got to Furious Flower

01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:35.010
in 1994 we had a lovefest
around poetry.

01:14:35.010 --> 01:14:36.320
Yes we did.

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:38.740
All right, you ready?

01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:44.440
Okay, who wants to speak first?

01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:48.710
Yes mic, someone has a mic.

01:14:48.710 --> 01:14:51.010
Yes.

01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:00.500
Okay here, we have one
over here, one over here.

01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:07.830
Stand up and say your name please.

01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:10.170
&gt;&gt; Hello, hi I'm Evelyn.

01:15:10.170 --> 01:15:15.920
My question I think is
mostly for is it Toi?

01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:19.780
Have you ever considered
having like an online component

01:15:19.780 --> 01:15:22.210
of Cave Canem like because I know?

01:15:22.210 --> 01:15:23.800
&gt;&gt; Toi Derricotte: Would
you like to be on our board?

01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:26.440
&gt;&gt; Yes I would.

01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:29.400
&gt;&gt; Toi Derricotte:
We're talking about all

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:32.040
that because it's a very
different organization

01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:34.480
than it was 20 years ago
when we were all sitting

01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:37.720
around Cornelius Eady's
coffee table.

01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:42.690
We have an office in New York,
we have 400 graduates all

01:15:42.690 --> 01:15:47.090
over the country, including
people like Rachel Eliza

01:15:47.090 --> 01:15:52.540
and other Cave Canem fellows
would you stand up today please.

01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:55.500
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: Kamilah Aisha
Moon, Anya, oh my goodness.

01:15:55.500 --> 01:16:05.640
All right, fabulous.

01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:09.040
&gt;&gt; Toi Derricotte: I mean
people are changing the world

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:11.770
and so there you have those
circles again, you know,

01:16:11.770 --> 01:16:16.100
because you have a person that
goes there, but then they go

01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:19.370
and they do what you're
doing, you know.

01:16:19.370 --> 01:16:22.590
And that's the way it works.

01:16:22.590 --> 01:16:26.260
So yeah, but we need
the money to do that.

01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:27.560
Got a check?

01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:33.120
You know, but that's the thing we
are totally reorganizing now I'm

01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:34.420
just making a joke.

01:16:34.420 --> 01:16:37.560
I didn't really, well I
did sort of mean that.

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:45.840
But we are rethinking what our
goals should be right now and so

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:50.230
in some ways we sort of
did our mission, you know,

01:16:50.230 --> 01:16:55.810
because these guys, you know, it'll
never stop, it'll always be circles

01:16:55.810 --> 01:16:58.300
and circles and circles
you can't stop it.

01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:04.140
But so what do we do
now and so thank you.

01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:09.270
There's the president of our
board right now is Jackie,

01:17:09.270 --> 01:17:13.440
so we were talking about this
and we'll figure it out right.

01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:14.740
Thanks so much.

01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:18.640
Why you would take
a class like that?

01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:21.360
Hey, would you pay for it?

01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:25.920
Now the thing about Cave Canem is
you get a scholarship when you go

01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:29.190
and the reason why we did that
is because we didn't want people

01:17:29.190 --> 01:17:32.370
to be able to buy their way in.

01:17:32.370 --> 01:17:36.760
So you only -- we get
like 300 applicants a year

01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:40.310
for like 20 spaces, it's
really hard to get it in.

01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:43.430
We didn't design it that
way, but it just turns

01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:47.480
out people really want to be there.

01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:54.430
But it was always about the work,
I mean but how you can do the work

01:17:54.430 --> 01:17:59.140
without love and a
place to talk, you know.

01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:02.140
So it's a great idea.

01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:05.710
Chalk that up, thank you.

01:18:05.710 --> 01:18:09.490
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: Jackie, stand up.

01:18:09.490 --> 01:18:11.900
The now director of.

01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:13.200
&gt;&gt; Toi Derricotte: The
president of our board.

01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:16.130
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: The president
of the board of Cave Canem

01:18:16.130 --> 01:18:22.880
and I met Jackie so long ago,
absolutely fabulous poet so yeah.

01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:24.180
&gt;&gt; Toi Derricotte:
And a fiction writer.

01:18:24.180 --> 01:18:25.980
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: Let's
recognize Jackie.

01:18:25.980 --> 01:18:31.510

there's always tough love
there, it's always in love.

[ Inaudible Comment ]

01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:56.230
Yeah we do our best for sure.

01:18:56.230 --> 01:18:58.530
Sure, thank you Jackie.

01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:03.380
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: Yes
over here please.

01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:10.390
&gt;&gt; Thanks, thank you everybody
for everything that you hear today

01:19:10.390 --> 01:19:14.680 position:56%
and special thanks to my new
colleague, the Smithsonian attorney,

01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:17.070
Vicki Brown, for telling
me about this program.

01:19:17.070 --> 01:19:18.840
I had the ticket for this evening,

01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:21.030
but I didn't know about
this presentation.

01:19:21.030 --> 01:19:23.900
I'm going to make this quick, it's
going to sound like a commercial,

01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:26.220
but I'm a historian and
it won't be a lecture.

01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:31.990
I'm editing a journal and a call
for submissions has this title,

01:19:31.990 --> 01:19:34.900
the revolution is now being
televised and tweeted.

01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:39.430
Black protest preaching
and re-presentations

01:19:39.430 --> 01:19:42.400
from the Black Arts Movement
to Black Lives Matter.

01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:47.140 position:56%
And I just felt compelled to do that
because by far my favorite decade

01:19:47.140 --> 01:19:50.990
of the 20th century is the
1920s, pushing it to the 1930's

01:19:50.990 --> 01:19:55.360
for the Harlem Renaissance,
but it's young women especially

01:19:55.360 --> 01:20:01.230
who are forcing me to rethink
how I see myself as an educator.

01:20:01.230 --> 01:20:04.680 position:56%
It's especially in this digital age.

01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:07.340
And I got to tell you I had to
go back and revise the language

01:20:07.340 --> 01:20:13.010
in this call for submissions
because say her name.

01:20:13.010 --> 01:20:14.310
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: Say her name.

01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:18.790
&gt;&gt; I realized that in this
I hadn't mentioned the name

01:20:18.790 --> 01:20:24.750
of a single black female
writer last week.

01:20:24.750 --> 01:20:28.160
I had to fix that because I
didn't want Nikki Giovanni

01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:31.310
to take me to task this evening.

01:20:31.310 --> 01:20:33.890 position:56%
But I'm so glad are you here Rachel?

01:20:33.890 --> 01:20:39.330
I'm so glad that Rachel included
the video in her presentation

01:20:39.330 --> 01:20:40.870
because I'm from Cleveland, Ohio.

01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:46.480
I have a 12-year-old son,
grandson that is, his dad is 31.

01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:49.850
But he lived in the same
neighborhood as Tamir Rice.

01:20:49.850 --> 01:20:53.610
And every time I watch
that video online okay

01:20:53.610 --> 01:20:55.250
because I'm not a big television.

01:20:55.250 --> 01:20:59.650
Every time I watch that video
it does something to me.

01:20:59.650 --> 01:21:03.250
But in this digital age we
need that online community

01:21:03.250 --> 01:21:05.880
and it's young women
who are teaching me

01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:09.970
that you don't need money for that
you need a twitter account maybe,

01:21:09.970 --> 01:21:12.350
you need a Facebook page perhaps,

01:21:12.350 --> 01:21:14.830
maybe you need a blog,
a word press blog.

01:21:14.830 --> 01:21:19.130
But there are a lot of things that
people can do to build community

01:21:19.130 --> 01:21:24.520
and I think at the same time
to share the power and the love

01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:30.230
that the arts happen to
foster in the academy and also

01:21:30.230 --> 01:21:31.530
in the surrounding community.

01:21:31.530 --> 01:21:33.580
So I'm just wondering am
I the only one, you know,

01:21:33.580 --> 01:21:36.260
who felt that conviction?

01:21:36.260 --> 01:21:40.150
You know that it's young women
especially in this day and age,

01:21:40.150 --> 01:21:44.790 position:56%
not just with Black Lives Matter and
what's happening to young black men,

01:21:44.790 --> 01:21:49.300
but also that we have to
say her name and understand

01:21:49.300 --> 01:21:53.350
that it still matters to be
black and female in this society.

01:21:53.350 --> 01:21:58.990
So I'm just wondering if there
are any reaction from the panel.

01:21:58.990 --> 01:22:00.290
&gt;&gt; Toi Derricotte: Amen.

01:22:00.290 --> 01:22:01.880
&gt;&gt; Michael Datcher: Amen is right.

01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:04.180
&gt;&gt; Sharan Strange: Yeah.

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:09.790 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: Well, you know, I
think it's really important to speak

01:22:09.790 --> 01:22:12.960
to that and I think
that you are on it.

01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:17.540
You know, if you use the
digital resources that you have,

01:22:17.540 --> 01:22:23.600
then you bring women and
girls into the dialogue

01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:25.970
because of course they're
on their phones,

01:22:25.970 --> 01:22:29.350
they're on their devices
like everyone else.

01:22:29.350 --> 01:22:33.130
But certainly that particular
theme is really so apropos

01:22:33.130 --> 01:22:36.390
and I really hope you
have good success with it.

01:22:36.390 --> 01:22:42.340
I'm just forced to
tell this story just

01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:44.250
because you brought up Tamir Rice.

01:22:44.250 --> 01:22:48.490
I cannot help but tell this
story, it's like that albatross

01:22:48.490 --> 01:22:50.600
around your neck, you know.

01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:54.840 position:56%
But I was in Cleveland and I had
the day in Cleveland just a free day

01:22:54.840 --> 01:23:00.780
and I was on the subway
going back to my hotel

01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:04.820
and I saw these little boys and
they were playing in the subway.

01:23:04.820 --> 01:23:08.730
And one was clearly the
leader of the other three

01:23:08.730 --> 01:23:10.370
and he was 17 I found out.

01:23:10.370 --> 01:23:15.620 position:56%
He sort of looked like Malcolm X, he
had his coloring and his read hair.

01:23:15.620 --> 01:23:19.350
And after and it was
really the two days

01:23:19.350 --> 01:23:23.600
or three days after Freddie Gray.

01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:28.790
And I had gone out of Baltimore
which was under curfew and it was

01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:34.720
on my mind that our black
boys are under attack.

01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:38.130
And so I just went up to them
and I just started talking

01:23:38.130 --> 01:23:44.450
about basketball and apparently
they liked me and they said,

01:23:44.450 --> 01:23:49.070 position:56%
well which way are you going mam and
I said I think I'm going your way.

01:23:49.070 --> 01:23:51.650
So they were jostling
the set next to me.

01:23:51.650 --> 01:23:55.850
And so one sat next to me and
the oldest one sat next to me

01:23:55.850 --> 01:24:00.100
and he said as we were
riding, Miss did you hear

01:24:00.100 --> 01:24:03.370
about Tamir Rice and I said yes.

01:24:03.370 --> 01:24:05.720
He said I'll show you
where he was shot.

01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:10.120
And as we were going down on
the train he says right up there

01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:13.310
and then he looked at me.

01:24:13.310 --> 01:24:15.630
And Michael, I will
never ever forget it

01:24:15.630 --> 01:24:21.760
and it makes me work harder in
terms of what we do as poets.

01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:28.640
But he said to me, why did he bring
that toy gun in the playground

01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:35.690
and he said that was his friend
and he was blaming his friend

01:24:35.690 --> 01:24:40.360
for having a toy gun
on the playground.

01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:46.580
And that look Toi of resignation
in his eyes just killed me

01:24:46.580 --> 01:24:54.460
because our children are growing up
feeling responsible for the hatred

01:24:54.460 --> 01:24:58.500
and the violence that
they are receiving.

01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:04.880
So it just makes me
cry to think about him.

01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:08.780
And so when Gwendolyn Brooks talks

01:25:08.780 --> 01:25:12.350
about the harvest that's
what she's talking about.

01:25:12.350 --> 01:25:16.000
We have to reclaim
these young people

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.130
and reclaim them through the word.

01:25:18.130 --> 01:25:20.430
We have time for one more question.

01:25:20.430 --> 01:25:22.000
&gt;&gt; Michael Datcher: I just want to
respond to that just for a second

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.450
because it was so powerful, wow.

01:25:24.450 --> 01:25:29.020
As I was saying earlier about this
animus scale and who has children,

01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:30.540
by a show of hands
who has kids here?

01:25:30.540 --> 01:25:32.300
If you're a parent you know

01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:34.440
that kids learn primarily
through what they see.

01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:37.870
You can talk to your kid until
you turn blue in the face,

01:25:37.870 --> 01:25:41.660
but a child for the most part is
going to learn by what they see.

01:25:41.660 --> 01:25:44.850
And because the adults
so often do not feel good

01:25:44.850 --> 01:25:47.140
about their positioning
on that animus scale

01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:50.230
that our children see it and
begin to value their own lives

01:25:50.230 --> 01:25:53.040
in a less way, in a way
that is counterproductive.

01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:56.930
So a young boy who is talking
about a 12-year-old kid playing

01:25:56.930 --> 01:26:02.520
with a toy gun who is shot within
two seconds of an officer arriving

01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:06.880
at a park in a state that's an
open carry state where it's legal

01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:10.250
to carry a gun in Ohio,
it's an open carry state.

01:26:10.250 --> 01:26:14.520
You can have a gun shown in
Ohio right, you can carry it

01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:16.850
in public it's an open
carry state so to say.

01:26:16.850 --> 01:26:21.100
But there was no asking for
a permit to carry a gun.

01:26:21.100 --> 01:26:23.430
There was no hey, do you have
a permit for that gun sir.

01:26:23.430 --> 01:26:27.620
It was I drive up and I
kill you in two seconds.

01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:30.270
And for another young black
boy to know that story

01:26:30.270 --> 01:26:32.480
and to have seen the video
I'm sure many, many times,

01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:37.520
but to blame the victim it shows
you the lack of respect in honoring

01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:39.730
that person [inaudible]
a young child is seeing.

01:26:39.730 --> 01:26:43.470
And the adults this goes back
to my reoccurring theme for us,

01:26:43.470 --> 01:26:48.480
how do we begin to make the
harvest better and more effective.

01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:51.750
It begins at home in our own
lives doing the internal work

01:26:51.750 --> 01:26:53.100
of valuing ourselves.

01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:56.030
However, you do that whether you're
meditating, praying, doing yoga,

01:26:56.030 --> 01:26:59.980
writing poetry or riding the bus
and talking to young black kids.

01:26:59.980 --> 01:27:02.130
Do something to work on yourself

01:27:02.130 --> 01:27:05.410
because when your kids see you
they know that black lives matter.

01:27:05.410 --> 01:27:10.290
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: Beautiful.

01:27:10.290 --> 01:27:12.430
We have time for one more
question or one more,

01:27:12.430 --> 01:27:15.020
yes one more comment or question.

01:27:15.020 --> 01:27:16.320
Yes.

01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:20.520
&gt;&gt; Thank you all of
you this is wonderful.

01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:24.450
This question first is for Michael,
but it's also for everybody.

01:27:24.450 --> 01:27:28.490 position:56%
I have been a witness to the work at
the world stage for many, many years

01:27:28.490 --> 01:27:35.010
and it's true that in that
room everybody is there,

01:27:35.010 --> 01:27:36.850
everybody from the
community is there.

01:27:36.850 --> 01:27:40.200
And because of that spirit of love
and that sign that's on the front

01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:43.510
of the podium, which I can't
believe you haven't talked

01:27:43.510 --> 01:27:50.060
about basically it's
like no BS basically.

01:27:50.060 --> 01:27:52.320
Because of everybody being called

01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:56.190
to be authentic there's a
spirit of family in the room.

01:27:56.190 --> 01:27:57.490
&gt;&gt; Michael Datcher: Absolutely.

01:27:57.490 --> 01:28:03.800
&gt;&gt; And an honesty in the stories
that are being shared and learning

01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:08.250 position:56%
and understanding of people you
might not know, might not really sit

01:28:08.250 --> 01:28:12.110
down and talk with and
that space was created.

01:28:12.110 --> 01:28:18.190
So for me it's a magical
space because the walls seem

01:28:18.190 --> 01:28:20.700
to make room for the love.

01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:24.850 position:56%
And when I leave I'm always changed.

01:28:24.850 --> 01:28:28.900
So my question for all of
you is how has this work,

01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:32.740
how has this founding work
affected not only the communities,

01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:35.040
but how has it affected your lives?

01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:36.340
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: Beautiful.

01:28:36.340 --> 01:28:37.640
&gt;&gt; Michael Datcher: I'll
let someone else speak first

01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:39.440
because I spoke last.

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:43.040
[ Inaudible Comment ]

01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:44.760
That's right.

01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:47.350
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: How has
it affected your lives?

01:28:47.350 --> 01:28:52.740
I'll say one thing and
let Toi start after that.

01:28:52.740 --> 01:28:58.320
In Cave Canem on the very
first night that they're there

01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:05.750
for the weeklong workshop they all
introduce themselves in a circle

01:29:05.750 --> 01:29:10.130
and say why they are in this space

01:29:10.130 --> 01:29:12.610
and what this particular
space means to them.

01:29:12.610 --> 01:29:17.830
And it's so moving it makes
me choke up, you know,

01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:21.660
to hear that for the first time

01:29:21.660 --> 01:29:27.510 position:56%
in their lives they find a protected
space in which to do their work.

01:29:27.510 --> 01:29:28.810
So Toi.

01:29:28.810 --> 01:29:31.810
&gt;&gt; Toi Derricotte: Yeah and
I remember the first year

01:29:31.810 --> 01:29:35.100
as we were going around a man said,

01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:39.730
this is the first place I've ever
been able to take off my defenses.

01:29:39.730 --> 01:29:41.030
&gt;&gt; Michael Datcher: Wow.

01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:43.820
&gt;&gt; Toi Derricotte: In my life
and it just like, you know,

01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:45.270
like he was in a bulletproof vest

01:29:45.270 --> 01:29:48.650
that suddenly dropped
to the floor you know.

01:29:48.650 --> 01:30:01.080
For me I'm so proud and I'm so in
love and I sort of feel I've done,

01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:05.110
I know I've done something
really surprising.

01:30:05.110 --> 01:30:12.740
And something that, you know,
makes me very joyful, very joyful.

01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:18.490
When I'm with the Cave
Canem people I'm happier

01:30:18.490 --> 01:30:23.010
than I am in any time in my life.

01:30:23.010 --> 01:30:28.830
But I still struggle with
depression and self-hate,

01:30:28.830 --> 01:30:34.190
these are still things
I deal with every day.

01:30:34.190 --> 01:30:40.830
You know, but in another
way, you know,

01:30:40.830 --> 01:30:44.060
when we think about these
circles in our lives, you know,

01:30:44.060 --> 01:30:49.280
sometimes things wouldn't
happen unless you had to fight

01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:54.200
and figure things out and
invent things you know.

01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:59.490
And so I don't know why I
think about people like Lucille

01:30:59.490 --> 01:31:01.530
who suffered so much in her life.

01:31:01.530 --> 01:31:06.930
You know, but hey look at what
Lucille did with it, you know.

01:31:06.930 --> 01:31:10.440
So this doesn't all mean your
problems go away, you know,

01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:15.490
but it means that, you know,
you get love and you get

01:31:15.490 --> 01:31:18.180
to do your work and, you know,
and that's what it's all about.

01:31:18.180 --> 01:31:21.550
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: That's
beautiful, that's beautiful.

01:31:21.550 --> 01:31:22.850
&gt;&gt; Sharan Strange: I would just say

01:31:22.850 --> 01:31:27.050
that the experience
makes you remember

01:31:27.050 --> 01:31:30.570
that you are part of
something larger.

01:31:30.570 --> 01:31:35.220 position:56%
That the work is about something
larger, something greater, you know,

01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:39.810
working within collectivity
you have to as Baraka says,

01:31:39.810 --> 01:31:42.770
think of yourself and
the other selves.

01:31:42.770 --> 01:31:51.490
And when Baraka came to Spelman
in 2008 he asked just a couple

01:31:51.490 --> 01:31:52.790
of questions of the students.

01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:57.840
He asked them to think
about their history

01:31:57.840 --> 01:32:00.670
and what is their relationship
to that history

01:32:00.670 --> 01:32:04.600
and then what is their
relationship to their community

01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:09.580
and what ultimately do
you intend to become.

01:32:09.580 --> 01:32:11.940
And so I think doing this kind

01:32:11.940 --> 01:32:15.980
of work collectively raises
those questions, you know,

01:32:15.980 --> 01:32:19.220
raises the question of
the larger, the greater.

01:32:19.220 --> 01:32:23.160
And so it makes me crave community

01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:29.310
and as a teacher it also challenges
me to have my students think

01:32:29.310 --> 01:32:32.690
in those terms too because
the vital, the vital work,

01:32:32.690 --> 01:32:36.560
the vital human work
is collective work.

01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:39.820
It's self-work, but
it's also collective,

01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:41.520
ultimately it's for the collective.

01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:47.920
So that work I think keeps me
centered in that kind of ethos

01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:52.710
and having that as a kind of
standard to know when I have failed

01:32:52.710 --> 01:32:58.240 position:56%
and to know that I need to keep
challenging myself and keep working.

01:32:58.240 --> 01:33:02.720
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: I want
you to have the last word.

01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:06.180
&gt;&gt; Michael Datcher:
All right, thanks.

01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:08.840
Thank you Ruth for that question.

01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:14.290
And you're right being around
the world stage is a very

01:33:14.290 --> 01:33:15.650
rewarding experience.

01:33:15.650 --> 01:33:18.390
And for me I just fall
in love with black people

01:33:18.390 --> 01:33:22.550
and the black experience and I
need that because so much of life

01:33:22.550 --> 01:33:24.430
as we know if you're an
African-American walking

01:33:24.430 --> 01:33:28.020
around in black skin
is very complicated.

01:33:28.020 --> 01:33:30.670
If I walk into a room, I'm
a professor of English,

01:33:30.670 --> 01:33:33.230
I have primarily as you can
imagine white colleagues.

01:33:33.230 --> 01:33:37.240
When I walk into a room the
room changes every time.

01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:42.910
I could tell you so many disturbing
stories, it's so damaging,

01:33:42.910 --> 01:33:45.810
it's so damaging that you have to,

01:33:45.810 --> 01:33:49.710
I have to work really
hard to love myself.

01:33:49.710 --> 01:33:52.860
And when I see beauty in black
environments like the World Stage,

01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:55.300
although it could be a very tough
space to be honest when it's

01:33:55.300 --> 01:33:57.480
about the craft because
people are very,

01:33:57.480 --> 01:33:59.700
very serious about
their craft there.

01:33:59.700 --> 01:34:04.550 position:56%
Although it can be very tough it's
such a beautiful space to see people

01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:06.810
from across the spectrum
of the black community.

01:34:06.810 --> 01:34:10.420
I mean literally gangsters,
prostitutes, professors,

01:34:10.420 --> 01:34:15.920
everyday people having high level
discourse about life and beauty

01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:17.300
and humanity and politics.

01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:22.050
It's very invigorating because
it says that you are alive.

01:34:22.050 --> 01:34:24.870
Folks who are saying to us
that you're less a human

01:34:24.870 --> 01:34:26.930
or that you somehow
are less valuable.

01:34:26.930 --> 01:34:31.680
Being there I see that it's a
lie, we are beautiful and I need

01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:34.170
to be reminded that
we are beautiful.

01:34:34.170 --> 01:34:38.170
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: And you
have been just an absolutely

01:34:38.170 --> 01:34:39.790
beautiful audience.

01:34:39.790 --> 01:34:47.100
I challenge you to go out and
organize in your own community.

01:34:47.100 --> 01:34:48.400
&gt;&gt; Michael Datcher: That's right.

01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:49.870
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: Organize
your own literary groups.

01:34:49.870 --> 01:34:51.170
&gt;&gt; Michael Datcher: That's right.

01:34:51.170 --> 01:34:55.410
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: Organize book
clubs, organize writing workshops,

01:34:55.410 --> 01:35:03.240
organize political meetings,
organize and that's the message

01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:07.540
that Baraka always gave, organize.

01:35:07.540 --> 01:35:12.090
You can be the architect
of your own movement.

01:35:12.090 --> 01:35:13.390
&gt;&gt; Michael Datcher: That's right.

01:35:13.390 --> 01:35:14.850
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: Your own group

01:35:14.850 --> 01:35:18.110
that will do something
positive in your community.

01:35:18.110 --> 01:35:24.860
I'm talking about everybody and
because really that's the legacy

01:35:24.860 --> 01:35:30.570
that we have inherited as children
of the Black Arts Movement.

01:35:30.570 --> 01:35:32.160
So thank you for being here.

01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:33.460
&gt;&gt; Michael Datcher: Thank you.

01:35:33.460 --> 01:35:34.760
&gt;&gt; Joanne Gabbin: I
enjoyed it so much.

01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:38.730
Give our panelists a rousing
applause, rousing applause.

01:35:40.390 --> 01:35:45.110
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
