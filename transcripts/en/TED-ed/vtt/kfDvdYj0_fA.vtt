00:00:07.503 --> 00:00:10.979
When trains began to shuttle people 
across the coutryside,

00:00:10.979 --> 00:00:14.325
many insisted 
they would never replace horses.

00:00:14.325 --> 00:00:18.813
Less than a century later, people 
repeated that same prediction about cars,

00:00:18.813 --> 00:00:20.101
telephones,

00:00:20.101 --> 00:00:20.912
radio,

00:00:20.912 --> 00:00:21.721
television,

00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:22.672
and computers.

00:00:22.672 --> 00:00:25.269
Each had their own host of detractors.

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:29.131
Even some experts 
insisted they wouldn’t catch on.

00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:32.688
Of course, we can’t predict exactly 
what the future will look like

00:00:32.688 --> 00:00:35.122
or what new inventions will populate it.

00:00:35.122 --> 00:00:36.679
But time and time again,

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:40.243
we’ve also failed to predict 
that the technologies of the present

00:00:40.243 --> 00:00:42.019
will change the future.

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:47.069
And recent research has revealed 
a similar pattern in our individual lives:

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:50.619
we’re unable to predict change 
in ourselves.

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:55.691
Three psychologists documented
our inability to predict personal change

00:00:55.691 --> 00:01:00.429
in a 2013 paper 
called, “The End of History Illusion.”

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:04.278
Named after political scientist 
Francis Fukuyama’s prediction

00:01:04.278 --> 00:01:07.367
that liberal democracy 
was the final form of government,

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:09.986
or as he called it, “the end of history,”

00:01:09.986 --> 00:01:14.165
their work highlights the way 
we see ourselves as finished products

00:01:14.165 --> 00:01:16.314
at any given moment.

00:01:16.314 --> 00:01:21.966
The researchers recruited over 
7,000 participants ages 18 to 68.

00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:26.123
They asked half of these participants to
report their current personality traits,

00:01:26.123 --> 00:01:27.054
values,

00:01:27.054 --> 00:01:28.590
and preferences,

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.347
along with what each of those metrics 
had been ten years before.

00:01:33.347 --> 00:01:36.949
The other half described those features 
in their present selves,

00:01:36.949 --> 00:01:40.712
and predicted what 
they would be ten years in the future.

00:01:40.712 --> 00:01:42.064
Based on these answers,

00:01:42.064 --> 00:01:44.911
the researchers then calculated 
the degree of change

00:01:44.911 --> 00:01:48.502
each participant reported or predicted.

00:01:48.502 --> 00:01:51.038
For every age group in the sample,

00:01:51.038 --> 00:01:54.495
they compared the predicted changes 
to the reported changes.

00:01:54.495 --> 00:01:58.648
So they compared the degree to which 
18-year-olds thought they would change

00:01:58.648 --> 00:02:03.059
to the degree to which 28-year-olds 
reported they had changed.

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:05.448
Overwhelmingly, at all ages,

00:02:05.448 --> 00:02:09.079
people’s future estimates of change 
came up short

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:13.240
compared to the changes 
their older counterparts recalled.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.063
20-year-olds expected 
to still like the same foods at 30,

00:02:17.063 --> 00:02:20.472
but 30-year-olds no longer 
had the same tastes.

00:02:20.472 --> 00:02:25.060
30-year-olds predicted they’d still 
have the same best friend at 40,

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.187
but 40-year-olds 
had lost touch with theirs.

00:02:28.187 --> 00:02:32.357
And 40-year-olds predicted 
they’d maintain the same core values

00:02:32.357 --> 00:02:35.492
that 50-year-olds had reconsidered.

00:02:35.492 --> 00:02:39.254
While older people changed less 
than younger people on the whole,

00:02:39.254 --> 00:02:43.655
they underestimated 
their capacity for change just as much.

00:02:43.655 --> 00:02:47.649
Wherever we are in life,
the end of history illusion persists:

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:52.923
we tend to think that the bulk 
of our personal change is behind us.

00:02:52.923 --> 00:02:54.687
One consequence of this thinking

00:02:54.687 --> 00:02:58.294
is that we’re inclined to overinvest 
in future choices

00:02:58.294 --> 00:03:00.800
based on present preferences.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.267
On average, people are willing 
to pay about 60% more

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:07.934
to see their current favorite musician 
ten years in the future

00:03:07.934 --> 00:03:12.468
than they’d currently pay to see their 
favorite musician from ten years ago.

00:03:12.468 --> 00:03:15.676
While the stakes involved
in concert-going are low,

00:03:15.676 --> 00:03:18.280
we’re susceptible 
to similar miscalculations

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.191
in more serious commitments,

00:03:20.191 --> 00:03:21.254
like homes,

00:03:21.254 --> 00:03:22.304
partners,

00:03:22.304 --> 00:03:23.652
and jobs.

00:03:23.652 --> 00:03:26.144
At the same time, 
there’s no real way to predict

00:03:26.144 --> 00:03:28.772
what our preferences 
will be in the future.

00:03:28.772 --> 00:03:30.593
Without the end of history Illusion,

00:03:30.593 --> 00:03:33.615
it would be difficult 
to make any long-term plans.

00:03:33.615 --> 00:03:38.106
So the end of history illusion 
applies to our individual lives,

00:03:38.106 --> 00:03:40.109
but what about the wider world?

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:45.146
Could we be assuming that how things 
are now is how they will continue to be?

00:03:45.146 --> 00:03:47.759
If so, fortunately,
there are countless records

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:52.293
to remind us that the world does change,
sometimes for the better.

00:03:52.293 --> 00:03:55.176
Our own historical moment 
isn’t the end of history,

00:03:55.176 --> 00:03:59.485
and that can be just as much a source
of comfort as a cause for concern.
