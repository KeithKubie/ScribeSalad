00:00:00.245 --> 00:00:01.059
- [Voiceover] Pause this video

00:00:01.059 --> 00:00:03.101
and see if you can subtract this magenta

00:00:03.101 --> 00:00:06.502
rational expression from this yellow one.

00:00:06.502 --> 00:00:08.406
Alright, now let's do this together.

00:00:08.406 --> 00:00:09.928
And the first thing that jumps out at you

00:00:09.928 --> 00:00:11.101
is that you realize these don't

00:00:11.101 --> 00:00:12.563
have the same denominator and you would

00:00:12.563 --> 00:00:14.118
like them to have the same denominator.

00:00:14.118 --> 00:00:16.148
And so you might say,
well, let me rewrite them

00:00:16.148 --> 00:00:18.584
so that they have a common denominator.

00:00:18.584 --> 00:00:20.710
And a common denominator that will work

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.710
will be one that is divisible
by each of these denominators.

00:00:26.142 --> 00:00:28.163
So it has all the factors of each

00:00:28.163 --> 00:00:29.799
of these denominators and lucky for us,

00:00:29.799 --> 00:00:32.260
each of these denominators
are already factored.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.245
So let me just write
the common denominator,

00:00:34.245 --> 00:00:37.462
I'll start rewriting
the yellow expression.

00:00:37.462 --> 00:00:39.237
So, you have the yellow expression,

00:00:39.237 --> 00:00:40.200
actually, let me just make it clear,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.186
I'm going to write both, the yellow one,

00:00:42.186 --> 00:00:45.600
and then you're going to
subtract the magenta one.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.743
Whoops. I'm saying yellow
but drawing in magenta.

00:00:49.743 --> 00:00:52.901
So you have the yellow expression

00:00:52.901 --> 00:00:54.202
which I'm about to rewrite, actually,

00:00:54.202 --> 00:00:55.263
I'm going to make a longer line,

00:00:55.263 --> 00:01:00.263
so the yellow expression
minus the magenta one,

00:01:02.391 --> 00:01:06.013
minus the magenta one, right over there.

00:01:06.013 --> 00:01:07.673
Now, as I mentioned, we
want to have a denominator

00:01:07.673 --> 00:01:09.716
that has all, the common
denominator has to have,

00:01:09.716 --> 00:01:12.537
be divisible by both,
this yellow denominator

00:01:12.537 --> 00:01:14.313
and this magenta one.

00:01:14.313 --> 00:01:19.270
So it's got to have
the Z plus eight in it.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.635
It's got to have the 9z minus five in it.

00:01:23.635 --> 00:01:25.912
And it's also got to have both of these.

00:01:25.912 --> 00:01:28.813
Well, I already, we already
accounted for the 9z minus five.

00:01:28.813 --> 00:01:33.813
So it has to have, be divisible
by Z plus six. Z plus six.

00:01:35.234 --> 00:01:36.928
Notice just by multiplying the denominator

00:01:36.928 --> 00:01:40.387
by Z plus six, we're not
divisible by both of these factors

00:01:40.387 --> 00:01:43.929
AND both of these factors
because 9z minus five

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:46.831
was the factor common to both of them.

00:01:46.831 --> 00:01:47.887
And if you were just dealing with numbers

00:01:47.887 --> 00:01:49.628
when you were just adding
or subtracting fractions,

00:01:49.628 --> 00:01:52.530
it works the exact same way.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.667
Alright, so what will
the numerator become?

00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:58.312
Well, we multiply the denominator times

00:01:58.312 --> 00:01:59.729
Z plus six, so we have to do the

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.470
same thing to the numerator.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.672
It's going to be negative Z
to the third times Z plus six.

00:02:05.672 --> 00:02:07.436
Now let's focus over here.

00:02:07.436 --> 00:02:09.932
We had, well, we want
the same denominator,

00:02:09.932 --> 00:02:13.392
so we can write this as Z plus eight

00:02:13.392 --> 00:02:18.392
Z plus eight times Z plus six,

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:24.499
times Z plus six times 9z minus five.

00:02:29.935 --> 00:02:31.514
And these are equivalent.

00:02:31.514 --> 00:02:33.371
I've just changed the order
that we multiply in it,

00:02:33.371 --> 00:02:35.077
that doesn't change their value.

00:02:35.077 --> 00:02:39.639
And if we multiplied the, so
we had a three on top before

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:42.135
and if we multiply the
denominator times Z plus eight,

00:02:42.135 --> 00:02:47.135
we also have to multiply the
numerator times Z plus eight.

00:02:48.181 --> 00:02:49.364
So there you go.

00:02:49.364 --> 00:02:52.047
And so, this is going to be equal to,

00:02:52.047 --> 00:02:54.287
this is going to be equal
to, actually, I'll just make

00:02:54.287 --> 00:02:58.188
a big line right over here.

00:02:58.188 --> 00:03:00.545
This is all going to be equal to.

00:03:00.545 --> 00:03:02.947
We have our, probably
don't need that much space,

00:03:02.947 --> 00:03:06.046
let me see, maybe that,
maybe about that much.

00:03:06.046 --> 00:03:08.102
So I'm going to have the same denominator

00:03:08.102 --> 00:03:10.343
and I'll just write it
in a neutral color now.

00:03:10.343 --> 00:03:15.343
Z plus eight times 9z minus
five times Z plus six.

00:03:20.035 --> 00:03:23.496
So over here, just in this blue color,

00:03:23.496 --> 00:03:26.339
we want to distribute this
negative Z to the third.

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:30.924
Negative Z to the third times
Z is negative Z to the fourth.

00:03:30.924 --> 00:03:35.924
Negative Z to the third times
six is minus 6z to the third.

00:03:37.238 --> 00:03:39.652
And now this negative
sign, right over here,

00:03:39.652 --> 00:03:42.938
actually, instead of saying negative Z,

00:03:42.938 --> 00:03:44.413
negative of this entire thing,

00:03:44.413 --> 00:03:48.313
we could just say plus
the negative of this.

00:03:48.313 --> 00:03:49.649
Or another of thinking about it,

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:54.129
you could view this as negative
three times Z plus eight.

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:55.859
So we could just distribute that.

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.298
So let's do that.

00:03:57.298 --> 00:04:02.298
So negative three times Z is negative 3z

00:04:02.975 --> 00:04:07.975
and negative three times
eight is negative 24.

00:04:08.037 --> 00:04:09.116
And there you go.

00:04:09.116 --> 00:04:11.752
We are, we are done.

00:04:11.752 --> 00:04:13.295
We found a common denominator.

00:04:13.295 --> 00:04:14.353
And once you have a common denominator,

00:04:14.353 --> 00:04:17.056
you could just subtract
or add the numerators,

00:04:17.056 --> 00:04:20.388
and instead of doing this
as minus this entire thing,

00:04:20.388 --> 00:04:23.187
I viewed it as adding and then having

00:04:23.187 --> 00:04:24.886
a negative three in the numerator,

00:04:24.886 --> 00:04:26.721
distributing that and then these,

00:04:26.721 --> 00:04:28.021
I can't simplify it any further.

00:04:28.021 --> 00:04:29.227
Sometimes you'll do one of these types

00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:30.469
of exercises and you might have

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:33.929
two second-degree terms
or two first-degree terms

00:04:33.929 --> 00:04:35.601
or two constants or something like that

00:04:35.601 --> 00:04:37.121
and then you might want
to add or subtract them

00:04:37.121 --> 00:04:40.128
to simplify it but here, these
all have different degrees

00:04:40.128 --> 00:04:45.128
so I can't simplify it any
further and so we are all done.
