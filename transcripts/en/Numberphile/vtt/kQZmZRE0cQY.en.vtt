00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.400
JAMES GRIME: We're going to try
out a little mathematical

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.200
trick with you today, Brady.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.880
It's nothing special.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.290
I mean, it's nothing new.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.950
But we'll try it out.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.430
I'm going to ask you to pick
a number between 1 and 30.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.270
Don't say it out loud,
but pick a number

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.930
between 1 and 30.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.290
Have you done that?

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:18.190
OK.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.260
BRADY HARAN: So we'll put
it on the screen, right?

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.600
JAMES GRIME: Yes.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.490
BRADY HARAN: There it is.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.990
JAMES GRIME: Yeah, great.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.840
So we put it on the screen,
and the guys at

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:23.750
home can play along.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.670
OK, so we're going to
use Brady's number.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.670
I don't know what his number
is at the moment, but I'm

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.590
going to hold up these cards.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.369
And they have numbers
on them, of course.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.380
If you see your number,
let me know.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.550
Say yes.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.070
And if you don't see your
number, say no.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.000
Say pass, something like that.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.210
OK, so let me know.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.060
BRADY HARAN: Yes

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.660
JAMES GRIME: Yes.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:45.420
Do you see your number?

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.270
BRADY HARAN: No.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.950
JAMES GRIME: No.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.280
Do you see your number?

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.330
BRADY HARAN: No.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.800
JAMES GRIME: No?

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.920
Do you see your number?

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.810
BRADY HARAN: No.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:55.255
JAMES GRIME: No.

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:56.910
Do you see your number?

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:57.830
BRADY HARAN: Yes.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:58.880
JAMES GRIME: Yes.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.130
Do you see your number?

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.240
BRADY HARAN: Yes.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.550
JAMES GRIME: Yes.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.540
Are we back at the beginning?

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.800
BRADY HARAN: Yes.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.200
JAMES GRIME: Yes.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.560
OK, so in that case, we're
back at the beginning.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.740
I can stop.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.710
So I know that your number
was 17, is that right?

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.170
BRADY HARAN: Yes.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.760
JAMES GRIME: Yes, right.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.240
So now, how did we do that?

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.340
It is an old trick, but if you
haven't seen it before, what

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.140
you do is I know which was
Brady's number because I was

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.190
adding up the numbers in
the top left corner.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.240
And now look at the
top left corners.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.610
I actually do it this way.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.600
If I spread out the cards,
they all have different

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.760
numbers on them.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.960
But look at the top
left corner.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.135
Now if you notice, the
top left corner are

00:01:38.135 --> 00:01:39.850
all powers of 2.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.170
Starting from 1, they're
powers of 2.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.190
So 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.080
Though 1 is a power of 2, it's
2 to the power of 0.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.330
I knew what Brady's number was
going to be because I added on

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.960
these left numbers for each
one he said yes for.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.180
So Brady said yes to this one.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.170
The red one.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.980
And he said yes to this
one, the blue one.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.620
And he said no to the others.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.490
And I knew that I could add
those two numbers together,

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.780
the 1 and the 16.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.670
And they added Brady's
secret number.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.510
Now the point is, every number
can be written as a sum of

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.720
powers of two.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.650
That's the point.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.400
So whatever number you pick,
these have been designed so

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.800
that if you add up the powers of
two, it will give you your

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.650
secret number.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.375
Let me show you what I mean.

00:02:33.375 --> 00:02:37.960
If I write down the powers
of two, so I just

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.220
start with a 1, though.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.620
I am going to write
it right to left.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.315
So 2, 4, 8, 16.

00:02:46.315 --> 00:02:46.760
OK.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.690
And we'll pick a number like,
I don't know, 20.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.440
Now, which of these two do
I need to use to make 20?

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.700
Which do I need to add on?

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.780
I'm going to use the
16 and the 4.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.860
I've written a 1 here to
indicate I'm using

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.140
the 16 and the 4.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.000
Don't use the rest.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.780
I'm going to write a 0 to show
that I don't use the rest.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.570
Now, this is binary.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.990
This is the famous binary,
which computers use.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.080
It's the count.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.270
I'm going to give you
a twist to this.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:14.970
I'm going to show you a new
way to do this trick.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.870
A less well known way
to do this trick.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:17.550
Let's try it out.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:18.920
I've got a new set
of cards here.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.490
This is a less well known
version of the trick.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:22.510
Same trick.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:23.955
Shall we do it in
the same way?

00:03:23.955 --> 00:03:24.310
BRADY HARAN: Yeayh.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.360
JAMES GRIME: All right, so
here's my cards again.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.480
You're going to pick
a number, of

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.040
course, keep it to yourself.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.860
But we can put it on the screen,
everyone can play.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:31.920
Have we done that?

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:32.420
BRADY HARAN: Yeah.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.010
JAMES GRIME: OK.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.500
Right.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.810
So hopefully we'll
do this again.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.130
OK, tell me yes and no when
you have your number.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.986
OK, yes?

00:03:41.986 --> 00:03:42.860
BRADY HARAN: No.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.150
JAMES GRIME: Sorry,
no for that one.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.210
BRADY HARAN: No.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.482
JAMES GRIME: No for that one.

00:03:50.482 --> 00:03:51.400
BRADY HARAN: No.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.920
JAMES GRIME: No for that one.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.920
BRADY HARAN: No.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.140
JAMES GRIME: No for that one.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.130
BRADY HARAN: Yes.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.178
JAMES GRIME: Yes for that one.

00:04:01.178 --> 00:04:02.070
BRADY HARAN: No.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.966
JAMES GRIME: No for that one.

00:04:03.966 --> 00:04:05.190
BRADY HARAN: No.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.910
JAMES GRIME: No for that one.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.220
Did you pick 8?

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.580
BRADY HARAN: Yes.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.310
JAMES GRIME: He picked 8.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.250
He picked this one on his own.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.595
OK.

00:04:10.595 --> 00:04:13.220
Now, did you notice
what the top left

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.840
numbers were this time?

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.440
They weren't the powers
of 2 this time.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.750
Did you notice what they were?

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.300
They were Fibonacci numbers.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.650
I can tell you that we
can do the same trick

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.210
using Fibonacci numbers.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.240
What I mean is, we can write
every number as a sum of

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.905
Fibonacci numbers as well,
like we did with binary.

00:04:31.905 --> 00:04:33.820
Let me try it out.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.490
So let's write out the
Fibonacci numbers.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.030
There's 1.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.630
There's 2.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.800
There is 3.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.510
And there's 8.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:44.480
No, there's 5.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.930
Get that right, James.

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.355
And then there's 8.

00:04:47.355 --> 00:04:49.541
Then there's 13.

00:04:49.541 --> 00:04:51.600
And 21?

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.410
Shall I go up to 21?

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:53.530
There we go.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:54.990
Right.

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.090
Now, let's pick a number.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.054
What shall we pick?

00:04:58.054 --> 00:04:58.950
BRADY HARAN: 19?

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:59.640
JAMES GRIME: 19.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.070
So I'm going to pick
the number 19.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.700
What do I need to make 19?

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.900
Let's use the 13, because that's
quite a big number.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.440
And wow, 6 now.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.820
So a 5 and a 1.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.970
So I've written 1's to
indicate what to use.

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.440
I'm going to write 0's
everywhere else.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.320
And again, it looks
like a binary sum.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.230
It's looks like my binary
is a binary sum.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.680
It uses 1's and 0's, but this
time the 1's indicate which

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.940
Fibonacci number to
add together.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.970
Using this idea, you can make
any number you want using

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:32.480
Fibonacci numbers.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.980
And if you don't use consecutive
Fibonacci numbers,

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.710
so here I used a 5.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.266
Now I could have used,
instead of 5, I could

00:05:39.266 --> 00:05:40.720
have done 2 and 3.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.130
Well, if I don't use consecutive
ones, it's unique.

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.460
So there's only one
way to do this.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.460
So you can do this trick with
Fibonacci, but now I'm going

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.570
to add an extra twist to this.

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.420
Because although I don't have
the cards for you, I'm afraid,

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:59.090
you can do this trick again
with prime numbers.

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.800
Every number can be written
as a sum of

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.400
prime numbers, as well.

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.980
So I'll show you how I made
those cards, then.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.420
And then everyone
can make them.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:12.560
Because you can make
them at home.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.930
So I'll use the powers
of 2 card.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.490
I'll show you how
to make them.

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.310
And then if you learn this, you
can make your Fibonacci

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.430
ones as well.

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:28.980
I started with the powers of
2 in the top left corner.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.580
Now I said, OK, I've got 1.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.310
I've got 2.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:33.370
3.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:37.385
Well, to make three, it has to
be on this card and on this

00:06:37.385 --> 00:06:41.050
card, because those numbers
add up to 3.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.230
So you write down
your 3 at that.

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:44.280
4 is here.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.220
Great.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:46.520
5.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.000
Well, how do I make 5?

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.005
1 and 4?

00:06:51.005 --> 00:06:55.750
So I have to write the 5 on
the 1 and the 4 card.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:59.090
Then the 6, well,
it's 4 and 2.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.760
So I have to write the
6 here and here.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.180
So let's go back
to Brady's 17.

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.750
As we know that 17 is, well,
think about the powers of 2.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.320
16 plus 1 would do it.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:16.080
And that's why I wrote 17 here
on the 16 card, and I wrote 17

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.820
here on 1 card.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.580
That's how I made them.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.170
Now, that fact that you can do
it with Fibonacci numbers is

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:23.270
not obvious.

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:24.930
It's called Zeckendorf's
theorem.

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:26.350
That's quite a cool name.

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:27.860
But it's actually misnamed.

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:32.520
The first guy who came up with
this was called Lekekeke, and

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.330
that was his name.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.240
That's fun that everyone
can enjoy.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.790
Lekekeke.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:40.970
The prime version of it is
also another surprise.

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.320
And altogether, if you want to
know how to do it in general,

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.970
it's called Brown's Criterion.

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:48.750
These aren't the only
sequences for

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:49.690
which this works for.

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:51.060
But they're the pretty
cool ones.
