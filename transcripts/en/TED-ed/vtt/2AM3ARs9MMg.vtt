00:00:13.505 --> 00:00:16.176
Are you familiar with the word symbiosis?

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.925
It's a fancy term for a partnership
between two different species,

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.576
such as bees and flowers.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.065
In a symbiosis, both species
depend on each other.

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:27.476
I want to tell you
about a remarkable symbiosis

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.876
between a little bird,
the Clark's nutcracker,

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.865
and a big tree, the whitebark pine.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.038
Whitebark grow in the mountains
of Wyoming, Montana

00:00:35.062 --> 00:00:36.436
and other western states.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.444
They have huge canopies
and lots of needles,

00:00:39.468 --> 00:00:42.444
which provide cover and shelter
for other plants and animals,

00:00:42.468 --> 00:00:45.345
and whitebark feed the forest.

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:47.464
Their cones are packed with protein.

00:00:47.488 --> 00:00:50.043
Squirrels gnaw the cones
from the upper branches

00:00:50.067 --> 00:00:51.360
so they fall to the ground,

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:54.345
and then race down to bury them
in piles, or middens.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.676
But they don't get to keep all of them;

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.821
grizzlies and black bears
love finding middens.

00:00:59.845 --> 00:01:03.096
But there's more to a symbiosis
than one species feeding another.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.692
In the case of the Clark's nutcracker,
this bird gives back.

00:01:06.716 --> 00:01:09.501
While gathering its seeds,
it also replants the trees.

00:01:10.059 --> 00:01:12.830
Here's how it works:
using her powerful beak,

00:01:12.854 --> 00:01:15.286
the nutcracker picks apart
a cone in a treetop,

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.765
pulling out the seeds.

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:19.645
She can store up to 80 of them
in a pouch in her throat.

00:01:19.669 --> 00:01:21.261
Then she flies through the forest

00:01:21.285 --> 00:01:23.095
looking for a place to cache the seeds

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.285
an inch under the soil
in piles of up to eight seeds.

00:01:26.309 --> 00:01:30.140
Nutcrackers can gather
up to 90,000 seeds in the autumn,

00:01:30.164 --> 00:01:32.541
which they return for
in the winter and spring.

00:01:32.565 --> 00:01:34.118
And these birds are smart.

00:01:34.142 --> 00:01:36.064
They remember where all those seeds are.

00:01:36.088 --> 00:01:38.126
They even use landmarks
on the landscape --

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.473
trees, stumps, rocks --

00:01:40.497 --> 00:01:43.135
to triangulate to caches
buried deep under the snow.

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.793
What they don't go back and get,
those seeds become whitebark.

00:01:47.921 --> 00:01:50.802
This symbiosis is
so important to both species

00:01:50.826 --> 00:01:54.063
that they've changed,
or evolved, to suit each other.

00:01:54.534 --> 00:01:57.200
Nutcrackers have developed
long, tough beaks

00:01:57.224 --> 00:01:59.460
for extracting seeds from cones,

00:01:59.484 --> 00:02:02.060
and whitebarks' branches all sweep upwards

00:02:02.084 --> 00:02:03.788
with the cones at the very ends,

00:02:03.812 --> 00:02:06.982
so they can offer them
to the nutcrackers as they fly by.

00:02:07.006 --> 00:02:08.649
That's a symbiosis:

00:02:08.673 --> 00:02:11.975
Two species cooperating to help
each other for the benefit of all.
