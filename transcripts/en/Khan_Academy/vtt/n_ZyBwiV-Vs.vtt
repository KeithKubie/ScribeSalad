00:00:00.206 --> 00:00:01.039
- [Instructor] In the last video,

00:00:01.039 --> 00:00:03.756
I started discussing the
Second Great Awakening,

00:00:03.756 --> 00:00:08.317
which was this era of
increased religious fervor,

00:00:08.317 --> 00:00:10.109
religious conversion,

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:14.061
and religiously inspired social action

00:00:14.061 --> 00:00:17.128
that happened in the early 19th century

00:00:17.128 --> 00:00:18.626
of the United States' history,

00:00:18.626 --> 00:00:21.126
so approximately 1790 to 1850,

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:24.657
although I'd say that
the height of this time

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:27.773
was from about 1820 to 1840.

00:00:27.773 --> 00:00:29.872
And the Second Great Awakening involved

00:00:29.872 --> 00:00:32.651
circuit riders, who were preachers

00:00:32.651 --> 00:00:35.691
without their own congregation going out,

00:00:35.691 --> 00:00:38.748
setting up these camp meetings,

00:00:38.748 --> 00:00:41.576
where they would preach
to thousands of people

00:00:41.576 --> 00:00:45.458
about a very emotional
version of Christianity.

00:00:45.458 --> 00:00:48.541
This included encouraging individuals

00:00:49.695 --> 00:00:52.146
to give up their ways as sinners

00:00:52.146 --> 00:00:56.248
and to work for the
creation of heaven on Earth.

00:00:56.248 --> 00:00:58.882
But when we think as historians,

00:00:58.882 --> 00:01:00.215
it's not enough just to say,

00:01:00.215 --> 00:01:03.606
okay, there was an explosion of religion

00:01:03.606 --> 00:01:06.828
in American culture in
the early 19th century.

00:01:06.828 --> 00:01:08.108
Instead we want to say

00:01:08.108 --> 00:01:12.536
what conditions in American
life led to this explosion?

00:01:12.536 --> 00:01:15.657
Why did this major cultural change happen?

00:01:15.657 --> 00:01:18.147
So let's explore some of what was going on

00:01:18.147 --> 00:01:20.017
in the early 19th century

00:01:20.017 --> 00:01:23.774
that led people to reinterpret religion.

00:01:23.774 --> 00:01:25.856
As I described in the last video,

00:01:25.856 --> 00:01:29.326
the Second Great Awakening
is part of this larger web

00:01:29.326 --> 00:01:32.468
of cultural, social,
and political movements

00:01:32.468 --> 00:01:33.921
and economic movements

00:01:33.921 --> 00:01:36.665
that are going on in this time period.

00:01:36.665 --> 00:01:38.853
Historians have spent a lot of time

00:01:38.853 --> 00:01:42.294
trying to figure out what
was going on in American life

00:01:42.294 --> 00:01:47.293
that led to this sudden
reemergence of religious devotion.

00:01:47.293 --> 00:01:51.346
So let's explore more
on this side of our web

00:01:51.346 --> 00:01:54.445
and I have two maps
for us to explore here.

00:01:54.445 --> 00:01:57.028
One is a map of the Erie Canal.

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.858
And this canal, which
allowed goods and crops

00:02:01.858 --> 00:02:04.549
and all sorts of things to be transported

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.897
from western New York down
to the Port of New York City,

00:02:08.897 --> 00:02:11.459
and this is kind of the area
that we're looking at here.

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.228
Let's see if I can make
it a little more obvious.

00:02:15.228 --> 00:02:19.395
So this is a blow-up of that
little region right there.

00:02:20.401 --> 00:02:23.151
This canal was completed in 1825.

00:02:24.128 --> 00:02:26.967
And I tell you this not just
because canals are awesome,

00:02:26.967 --> 00:02:28.293
although they are,

00:02:28.293 --> 00:02:31.430
but because the Erie Canal
is a really important moment

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.907
in what's called the Market Revolution.

00:02:33.907 --> 00:02:36.535
Now, I'll go more into
the Market Revolution

00:02:36.535 --> 00:02:38.137
in another video,

00:02:38.137 --> 00:02:40.293
but what's important about
the Market Revolution

00:02:40.293 --> 00:02:45.192
is that it's this time when
how Americans did business

00:02:45.192 --> 00:02:47.004
and their social interactions

00:02:47.004 --> 00:02:48.799
with people that they did business with

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:50.543
really changed a lot.

00:02:50.543 --> 00:02:52.382
So there are a couple important aspects

00:02:52.382 --> 00:02:54.123
of the Market Revolution.

00:02:54.123 --> 00:02:57.534
One of these is a revolution
in transportation,

00:02:57.534 --> 00:02:59.867
which includes the invention

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.996
and slow expansion of railroads,

00:03:04.831 --> 00:03:07.163
canals, like the Erie Canal,

00:03:07.163 --> 00:03:08.878
steamships.

00:03:08.878 --> 00:03:12.196
And steamships let you do things like

00:03:12.196 --> 00:03:14.388
go the wrong way up the Mississippi River

00:03:14.388 --> 00:03:16.903
and look at all the farmland that leads

00:03:16.903 --> 00:03:19.647
to this Port of New Orleans here.

00:03:19.647 --> 00:03:22.615
So these new forms of transportation

00:03:22.615 --> 00:03:25.219
make it much easier for farmers

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:27.552
and people who produce goods

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.967
to get those goods to distant markets.

00:03:34.955 --> 00:03:38.593
So if you're a farmer here in Buffalo,

00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:43.009
now, instead of only being
able to sell your apples,

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:46.572
say, to people who live
within a certain radius

00:03:46.572 --> 00:03:49.176
before your apples go
bad, you can just put them

00:03:49.176 --> 00:03:52.559
on a nice little barge on the Erie Canal

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:54.064
and send them down to New York City

00:03:54.064 --> 00:03:55.430
within a number of days.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.263
Likewise, if you're
farming wheat in Missouri,

00:04:00.112 --> 00:04:02.689
you don't have to sell
to just people in here.

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:04.942
You can now sell to people

00:04:04.942 --> 00:04:07.048
all the way down in New Orleans.

00:04:07.048 --> 00:04:07.881
And that means you can also

00:04:07.881 --> 00:04:09.930
even sell to people
internationally, right?

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.957
These are the big ports,

00:04:11.957 --> 00:04:15.290
New York City, Philadelphia, Charleston.

00:04:16.663 --> 00:04:18.348
So as a producer of goods,

00:04:18.348 --> 00:04:21.171
you are not just part
of a small local market.

00:04:21.171 --> 00:04:23.670
You're now part of an
international market.

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.603
And it also means you're gonna
need ways of communicating

00:04:26.603 --> 00:04:28.328
with people who are far away,

00:04:28.328 --> 00:04:30.995
like the telegraph, for example.

00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:33.867
But one more anxious aspect

00:04:33.867 --> 00:04:36.222
of this new kind of market-based system

00:04:36.222 --> 00:04:38.860
is that you're no longer doing business

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.363
quite so much with people that you know.

00:04:41.363 --> 00:04:45.530
So you might correspond only
by letter or by telegram

00:04:47.106 --> 00:04:50.669
to the main buyer for your crops.

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:52.523
And likewise, someone
who's buying those crops

00:04:52.523 --> 00:04:55.672
might only be able to correspond distantly

00:04:55.672 --> 00:04:57.713
with the person who's producing them.

00:04:57.713 --> 00:04:59.718
So this personal relationship

00:04:59.718 --> 00:05:04.227
between people who are
exchanging goods and services

00:05:04.227 --> 00:05:08.098
starts to erode and that's very anxious

00:05:08.098 --> 00:05:09.944
for a lot of people.

00:05:09.944 --> 00:05:11.123
How do you know that the person

00:05:11.123 --> 00:05:13.521
on the other end of your transaction

00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:16.063
isn't going to con you in some way?

00:05:16.063 --> 00:05:18.362
You see this a lot in this time period.

00:05:18.362 --> 00:05:20.382
The United States also starts to urbanize

00:05:20.382 --> 00:05:23.470
and there's lots of writing
about how people worry

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.606
that the people that they're
passing on the street

00:05:25.606 --> 00:05:28.935
might be con men or
otherwise out to get them.

00:05:28.935 --> 00:05:31.330
You know, in many ways,
up until this time,

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.963
the United States had
something of a barter economy.

00:05:34.963 --> 00:05:37.575
If you look at people's personal ledgers,

00:05:37.575 --> 00:05:41.595
you know, everybody
kept a very detailed log

00:05:41.595 --> 00:05:46.113
of what they had given to
whom and who they owed what.

00:05:46.113 --> 00:05:49.059
In an average day, somebody might give you

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:51.802
a carton of eggs on credit

00:05:51.802 --> 00:05:55.969
and you might build a log
cabin for somebody on credit

00:05:56.827 --> 00:06:00.577
because there was this
mutual community system

00:06:00.577 --> 00:06:04.301
of giving and owing that
everyone had a notion

00:06:04.301 --> 00:06:07.666
could be enforced, at
least through social mores.

00:06:07.666 --> 00:06:09.897
Now, as people begin dealing distantly,

00:06:09.897 --> 00:06:12.653
those social mores don't exist

00:06:12.653 --> 00:06:14.523
and it makes people really nervous.

00:06:14.523 --> 00:06:16.813
The other aspect of this Market Revolution

00:06:16.813 --> 00:06:18.306
that I think is pretty important

00:06:18.306 --> 00:06:20.574
is, in this time period,
more and more people

00:06:20.574 --> 00:06:23.071
start working for wages

00:06:23.071 --> 00:06:26.124
as opposed to being subsistence farmers.

00:06:26.124 --> 00:06:28.550
So, you know, in the
early Colonial period,

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.767
most people worked, it's
kind of a family unit.

00:06:31.767 --> 00:06:35.498
Various tasks might be assigned
to various family members,

00:06:35.498 --> 00:06:38.100
but one way or another,
everybody worked in the home.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.830
Now, as factories start to spring up

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.722
as part of the Market Revolution,

00:06:42.722 --> 00:06:45.978
people are going to work for wages

00:06:45.978 --> 00:06:49.502
and typically involves
a man leaving the home

00:06:49.502 --> 00:06:51.221
and the woman remaining in it.

00:06:51.221 --> 00:06:53.878
So we get what was known
as the cult of domesticity,

00:06:53.878 --> 00:06:56.850
where women are the guardians of the home

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:59.451
and the moral guardians of their families

00:06:59.451 --> 00:07:02.900
and men go out into the
cruel world and toil away

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.247
for their daily bread.

00:07:04.247 --> 00:07:05.717
So why does that matter?

00:07:05.717 --> 00:07:06.959
Well, one reason that it matters

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:10.372
is because people are now
no longer their own bosses.

00:07:10.372 --> 00:07:12.397
Somebody else is the boss of that person.

00:07:12.397 --> 00:07:15.249
And they only have so much motivation

00:07:15.249 --> 00:07:16.913
to get something done, right?

00:07:16.913 --> 00:07:19.548
If your whole family's subsistence depends

00:07:19.548 --> 00:07:22.619
on you making sure that you
get this crop in on time,

00:07:22.619 --> 00:07:24.220
you're gonna make sure it happens.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.543
But if you're just being paid by the hour

00:07:26.543 --> 00:07:29.954
to run a spindle at a textile factory,

00:07:29.954 --> 00:07:32.312
how much money your boss
makes off your labor

00:07:32.312 --> 00:07:34.327
isn't really your concern.

00:07:34.327 --> 00:07:36.592
And so there's a lot of anxiety

00:07:36.592 --> 00:07:41.310
around making what had been
basically a farming nation

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.334
into an industrial nation.

00:07:43.334 --> 00:07:47.688
How does one behave as
a worker in a factory

00:07:47.688 --> 00:07:50.499
and how does one, as a factory owner,

00:07:50.499 --> 00:07:54.401
make sure that you have
a sober, intelligent,

00:07:54.401 --> 00:07:58.424
hard-working, but not too rowdy workforce?

00:07:58.424 --> 00:08:01.400
So both of these innovations,

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.691
the relationship between
buyers and sellers

00:08:04.691 --> 00:08:06.442
in distant markets,

00:08:06.442 --> 00:08:07.343
and the relationship

00:08:07.343 --> 00:08:10.542
between factory owners and factory workers

00:08:10.542 --> 00:08:13.501
create anxiety about
how you're going to know

00:08:13.501 --> 00:08:14.834
people are good,

00:08:16.078 --> 00:08:17.575
how you're going to know that people

00:08:17.575 --> 00:08:20.312
are holding up their end in society.

00:08:20.312 --> 00:08:25.067
And one way to promote
that is through religion,

00:08:25.067 --> 00:08:27.242
which tells you not to be a sinner,

00:08:27.242 --> 00:08:29.109
which tells you to do a good job,

00:08:29.109 --> 00:08:32.722
which tells you to be a
productive member of society

00:08:32.722 --> 00:08:34.349
and work for the common good,

00:08:34.349 --> 00:08:36.272
and promote your moral compass.

00:08:36.272 --> 00:08:37.620
Now, that's just one explanation

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.572
for why the Second Great Awakening

00:08:39.572 --> 00:08:41.106
took off in this time period.

00:08:41.106 --> 00:08:43.857
And you can tell, it's
kind of a grim one, right,

00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:46.349
in terms of promoting religion

00:08:46.349 --> 00:08:48.727
basically to keep people in line.

00:08:48.727 --> 00:08:51.185
But that's not the only
possible explanation

00:08:51.185 --> 00:08:54.567
for why the Second Great
Awakening may have happened.

00:08:54.567 --> 00:08:56.624
There are also a bunch of social changes

00:08:56.624 --> 00:08:59.295
in this time period that could be

00:08:59.295 --> 00:09:03.168
serious contributors to
this explosion of religion.

00:09:03.168 --> 00:09:07.550
Now, one of these was just
westward expansion in general.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:10.467
So as the United States moved west,

00:09:11.813 --> 00:09:14.056
the rate of western expansion, really,

00:09:14.056 --> 00:09:16.248
actually increased in this time period.

00:09:16.248 --> 00:09:19.813
So about 1790, the center
of American population

00:09:19.813 --> 00:09:21.944
was about here, right?

00:09:21.944 --> 00:09:24.959
So let's think about both north and south,

00:09:24.959 --> 00:09:27.513
east and west, where people lived.

00:09:27.513 --> 00:09:29.889
If you kind of totaled them all up

00:09:29.889 --> 00:09:31.928
and put a dot right in the middle

00:09:31.928 --> 00:09:33.222
of where everybody lived,

00:09:33.222 --> 00:09:35.607
it would just be right here
kind of on the Eastern Seaboard,

00:09:35.607 --> 00:09:38.220
as everyone's pretty close to the coast.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:42.387
By 1840, the center of
population was way over here.

00:09:45.007 --> 00:09:47.608
So just think, if this is all the people

00:09:47.608 --> 00:09:51.017
who had to live there to be
on either side of that line,

00:09:51.017 --> 00:09:52.498
think of how many people have to be

00:09:52.498 --> 00:09:55.143
on either side of this line

00:09:55.143 --> 00:09:58.568
for the population to have
its center right there.

00:09:58.568 --> 00:10:02.184
So people have really spread
out in this time period.

00:10:02.184 --> 00:10:05.917
Where before, there was kind
of this east coast elite

00:10:05.917 --> 00:10:06.945
where all the money was,

00:10:06.945 --> 00:10:08.874
now the Market Revolution has meant

00:10:08.874 --> 00:10:12.248
that people who live along these byways,

00:10:12.248 --> 00:10:16.044
live along rivers and
canals and railroads,

00:10:16.044 --> 00:10:17.226
those towns are gonna start

00:10:17.226 --> 00:10:19.710
having people in them with some money.

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:22.434
And so the middle class expands

00:10:22.434 --> 00:10:26.197
and the amount of people
who have the vote expands.

00:10:26.197 --> 00:10:29.979
So it's really a time of
expanding democracy in general,

00:10:29.979 --> 00:10:33.344
both in terms of wealth and
in terms of political power.

00:10:33.344 --> 00:10:35.888
And so you can see why a religion

00:10:35.888 --> 00:10:39.142
like that promoted in the
Second Great Awakening,

00:10:39.142 --> 00:10:41.633
the Baptists, the Methodists,

00:10:41.633 --> 00:10:44.578
that said anyone can have
a relationship with God,

00:10:44.578 --> 00:10:46.022
would become more popular

00:10:46.022 --> 00:10:48.408
as more and more people started to kind of

00:10:48.408 --> 00:10:50.650
take their own fates in
their own hands, right?

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:53.967
This is the time of the rugged individual,

00:10:53.967 --> 00:10:56.740
a very popular idea that one, you know,

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.399
pulled oneself by the bootstraps

00:10:59.399 --> 00:11:01.428
and that's the pioneering spirit.

00:11:01.428 --> 00:11:04.647
So very characteristic American values

00:11:04.647 --> 00:11:07.904
that went into making a type of religion

00:11:07.904 --> 00:11:09.956
with more individuality,

00:11:09.956 --> 00:11:12.670
with more possibilities for more people

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:15.839
much more popular in this time period.

00:11:15.839 --> 00:11:16.763
And there's one case of this

00:11:16.763 --> 00:11:18.497
that I think is really interesting

00:11:18.497 --> 00:11:20.587
and it's in western New York.

00:11:20.587 --> 00:11:24.442
So in western New York,
there's the town of Rochester.

00:11:24.442 --> 00:11:28.250
And Rochester is really like a boomtown.

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:29.730
It's along the Erie Canal,

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:32.013
as we saw in the previous map.

00:11:32.013 --> 00:11:33.854
And Rochester becomes, kind of,

00:11:33.854 --> 00:11:37.525
almost the epicenter of
new religious movements

00:11:37.525 --> 00:11:38.837
in this time period.

00:11:38.837 --> 00:11:41.754
So within this radius of Rochester,

00:11:43.781 --> 00:11:48.081
people called this the
burned-over district

00:11:48.081 --> 00:11:52.473
because there were so
many religious revivals

00:11:52.473 --> 00:11:53.570
in this time period,

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:55.439
that it was like the whole district

00:11:55.439 --> 00:11:57.150
was burned over with hellfire,

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:58.541
these preachers coming past

00:11:58.541 --> 00:12:00.817
and talking about the apocalypse.

00:12:00.817 --> 00:12:02.703
And so we'll get to talking more

00:12:02.703 --> 00:12:04.212
about some of the religious movements

00:12:04.212 --> 00:12:05.760
that come out of this,

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.497
but within just a couple
of miles of Rochester,

00:12:09.497 --> 00:12:11.997
the Oneida Community was born.

00:12:13.632 --> 00:12:16.632
Spiritualism, which was the religion

00:12:17.645 --> 00:12:21.284
that's kind of based
around seances was born.

00:12:21.284 --> 00:12:24.686
The Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-Day Saints,

00:12:24.686 --> 00:12:26.769
often called the Mormons,

00:12:28.499 --> 00:12:31.706
their religion was born outside Rochester.

00:12:31.706 --> 00:12:34.479
Even the Shakers were founded

00:12:34.479 --> 00:12:36.911
in upstate New York, near Albany.

00:12:36.911 --> 00:12:38.628
So I think it's noteworthy that,

00:12:38.628 --> 00:12:41.128
as new communities, new people

00:12:42.504 --> 00:12:46.518
are gaining prominence
through the Market Revolution,

00:12:46.518 --> 00:12:49.267
along with them comes a
new religious movement.

00:12:49.267 --> 00:12:51.937
And we'll talk more about what the impact

00:12:51.937 --> 00:12:55.101
of this new religious movement
was on American society

00:12:55.101 --> 00:12:56.332
in the next video.
