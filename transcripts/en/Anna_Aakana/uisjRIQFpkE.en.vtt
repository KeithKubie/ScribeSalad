00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:06.100
 I am thinking about death a lot, whether it is my sister's suicide and my question about what happened to her, 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.840
 Or just a theoretical for people around me and my knowledge that we are all temporary, 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.780
 - "O hell, there is an insect in the water" - "One day, we will all become an insect in water" 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.680
 Or ask me how I will die. 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.400
 "Know when you can go to your home ..." 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.440
 "Just for fun." 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.160
 "This is the last face I will see." 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.800
 I think the awareness of death helps you to truly live because it puts everything in your perspective. 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.100
 Do not care about small things too much, encourage you to do what you really want to do, 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.420
 You begin to measure your happiness relative to your experiences, and how satisfied you are with your relationships. 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.780
 Of course it is sometimes more than bear and lead you to lie down on your bed 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.900
 She wonders about the meaning of all this, but it has affected my life in beautiful ways. 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.420
 Thinking about death made me feel more present 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.800
 Because it is a reminder that you can not guarantee tomorrow. 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.660
 It makes me want to be a more sympathetic and generous person 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.380
 Because when you have the idea of ​​your death you should ask yourself: 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.360
 What impact do I want to leave in this world? 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.620
 How do I want to measure my values ​​and what will make my life meaningful? 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.460
 And to know how I am not permanent and small compared to the greatness of the universe 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.380
 Somewhat I have come to a conclusion that I consider my life successful 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.560
 If you make a meaningful and inspiring art for people, if you help as many animals and people as possible, 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.800
 And whether I have an emotional relationship that is full of love with my friends and family. 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.460
 The manic intensity of death at a young age prompted me to make a philosophy about life, 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.100
 And I encourage you to do the same thing. 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.900
 Is just one sentence you can follow throughout your life, is like your expression of a hypothesis 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.420
 Or logo that is in line with you you can refer to it time after time when 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.240
 Life's tricks fool you into thinking you're going to be lost forever. 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.240
 But you will not. 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.840
 My slogan, which he used for 15 years, is "I love, so I am." 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.260
 Let me know what is the philosophy of your life, I would love to hear it 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.960
 I'm Okana, stay ... 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.300
