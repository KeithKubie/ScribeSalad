00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:05.350
A couple of videos ago we
introduced the idea of the

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.240
length of a vector.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.210
That equals the length.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.560
And this was a neat idea because
we're used to the

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.720
length of things in two- or
three-dimensional space, but

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.730
it becomes very abstract when
we get to n dimensions.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.250
If this has a hundred
components, at least for me,

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.210
it's hard to visualize a hundred
dimension vector.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.410
But we've actually defined
it's notion of length.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.900
And we saw that this is actually
a scalar value.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.270
It's just a number.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.530
In this video, I want to attempt
to define the notion

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.125
of an angle between vectors.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.880
As you can see, we're building
up this mathematics of vectors

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.495
from the ground up, and we can't
just say, oh, I know

00:00:51.495 --> 00:00:53.590
what an angle is because
everything we know about

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.410
angles and even lengths, it
just applies to what we

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.650
associate with two- or
three-dimensional space.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.230
But the whole study of linear
algebra is abstracting these

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.010
ideas into multi-dimensional
space.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.240
And I haven't even defined what
dimension is yet, but I

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.030
think you understand that idea
to some degree already.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.020
When people talk about one or
two or three dimensions.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.020
So let's say that I have some
vector-- let's say I have two

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.530
vectors, vectors a and b.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.460
They're nonzero and they're
members of Rn.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.790
And I don't have a notion of
the angle between them yet,

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.430
but let me just draw them out.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.390
Let me just draw them as if
I could draw them in two

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.870
dimensions.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.960
So that would be vector
a right there.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.400
Maybe that's vector
b right there.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.980
And then this vector right
there would be the

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.810
vector a minus b.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.050
And you can verify that just the
way we've learned to add

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.200
and subtract vectors.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.310
Or you know, this is
heads to tails.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.840
So b plus a minus b is of
course, going to be vector a.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.490
And that all just
works out there.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.050
To help us define this notion
of angle, let me construct

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.345
another triangle that's going
to look a lot like this one.

00:02:12.345 --> 00:02:17.470
But remember, I'm just doing
this for our simple minds to

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.140
imagine it in two dimensions.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.030
But these aren't necessarily
two-dimensional beasts.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.000
These each could have a
hundred components.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.555
But let me make another
triangle.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.440
Well, it should look similar.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.000
Say it looks like that.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.040
And I'm going to define the
sides of the triangles to be

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.090
the lengths of each
of these vectors.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.250
Remember, the lengths of each of
these vectors, I don't care

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.460
how many components there
are, they're just

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.680
going to be your numbers.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.980
So the length of this side right
here is just going to be

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.530
the length of a.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.580
The length of this side right
here is just going to be the

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.695
length of vector a
minus vector b.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.780
And the length of this side
right here is going to be the

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.010
length of vector b.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.990
Now the first thing we want to
make sure is that we can

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.500
always construct a triangle
like that.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.940
And so under what circumstances
could we not

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.280
construct a triangle
like this?

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.550
Well we wouldn't be able
construct a triangle like this

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.820
if this side.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.410
if b, if the magnitude-- so
let me write this down.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:20.710
It's kind of a subtle
point, but I want to

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.520
make this very clear.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.810
In order to define an angle, I
want to be comfortable that I

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.300
can always make this
construction.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.680
And I need to make sure that--
let me write reasons why I

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:39.490
couldn't make this
construction.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:45.310
Well what if the magnitude of
b was greater than, or the

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.450
length of vector b was greater
than the length of vector a

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.760
plus the length of
vector a minus b?

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.260
In two dimensions, I could never
draw a triangle like

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.950
that then because you would
have this length plus this

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.680
length would be shorter than
this thing right here.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.010
So you could never
construct it.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.200
And I could do with
all the sides.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.470
What if this length was larger
than one of these two sides?

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.080
Or what if that length
was larger than one

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.760
of those two sides?

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.300
I could just never draw
a two-dimensional

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.560
triangle that way.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.800
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to use the triangle--

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.544
the vector triangle inequality
to prove that each of these

00:04:21.544 --> 00:04:27.560
sides is less than or equal to
the sum of the other sides.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.540
I could do the same thing.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.620
Let me make the point clear.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.500
I could show that if a, for
whatever reason, was greater

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:39.190
than the other sides plus b,
then I wouldn't be able to

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.990
create a triangle.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.020
And the last one of course is
if a minus b, for whatever

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.200
reason, was greater than the
other two sides, I just

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.310
wouldn't be able to draw
a triangle in a plus b.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.590
So I need to show that for any
vectors, any real vectors--

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.770
nonzero, real vectors that are
members of Rn-- that none of

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.180
these can ever happen.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.970
I need to prove that none
of those can happen.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.580
So what does the triangle
inequality tell us?

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.680
The triangle inequality tells
us that if I have the sum of

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:12.250
two vectors, if I take the
length of the sum of two

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:18.400
vectors, that that is always
going to be less than-- and

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.360
these are nonzero vectors.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.710
This is always going to be less
than or equal to the sum

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.510
of each of their individual
lengths.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.020
So let's see if we can
apply that to this

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.930
triangle right here.

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:41.250
So what is the magnitude,
the length of a?

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.780
Well I can rewrite vector a.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.110
What is vector a equal to?

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:53.380
Vector a is equal to vector
b plus vector a minus b.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.450
I mean I'm just rewriting
the vector here.

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.970
I'm just rewriting a here as a
sum of the other two vectors.

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:00.910
Nothing fancy there.

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:02.790
I haven't used the triangle
inequality or anything.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.060
I've just used my definition
of vector addition.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.630
But here now, if I put little
parentheses here, now I can

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:10.820
apply the triangle inequality.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:11.760
And I say, well,
you know what?

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.440
This is going to be, by the
triangle inequality, which

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.180
we've proved, it's going to be
less than or equal to the

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.740
lengths of each of
these vectors.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:27.410
Vector b plus the length
of vector a minus b.

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:31.400
So we know that the length of a
is less than the sum of that

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.560
one and that one.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.980
So we don't have to worry about
this being our problem.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.270
We know that that is not true.

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.610
Now let's look at b.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.040
So is there any way that I can
rewrite b as a sum of two

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.790
other vectors?

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:47.650
Well sure.

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:55.800
I can write it as a sum of a
plus, let me put it this way.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.610
If that vector right there is a
minus b, the same vector in

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:03.720
the reverse direction is going
to be the vector b minus a.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:10.770
So a plus the vector
b minus a.

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:11.890
That's the same thing as b.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.290
And you can see it right here.

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:14.580
The a's would cancel
out and you're just

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:15.990
left with the b there.

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.710
Now by the triangle inequality,
we know that this

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:25.960
is less than or equal to the
length of vector a plus the

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.350
length of vector b minus a.

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:31.930
Now you're saying hey, Sal,
you're dealing with b minus a.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.200
This is the length
of a minus b.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.630
And I can leave this for you
to prove it based on our

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:45.400
definition of vector lengths,
but the length of b minus a is

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:50.830
equal to minus 1 times
a minus b.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:54.050
And I'll leave it to you
to say that look,

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:57.250
these lengths are equal.

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.780
Because essentially-- I could
leave that, but I think you

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:05.030
can take that based on just the
visual depiction of them

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:07.510
that they're the exact same
vectors, just in different

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:07.930
directions.

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:09.850
And I have to be careful with
length because it's not just

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:10.780
in two dimensions.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:14.290
But I think you get the idea and
I'll leave that for you to

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:16.450
prove that these lengths
are the same thing.

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:18.850
So we know that b is less
than the length

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:20.270
of those two things.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:25.000
So we don't have to worry about
that one right there.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.595
Finally, a minus b.

00:08:28.595 --> 00:08:35.919
The magnitude or the length
of vector a minus b.

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:41.940
Well I can write that as the
length of-- or I can write

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:46.140
that as vector a plus
vector minus b.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.610
If we just put a minus b right
there and go in the other

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:55.560
directions, we could say minus
b, which would be in that

00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:01.550
direction plus a would give
us our vector a minus b.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:02.680
Actually, I don't even
have to go there.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:03.650
That's obvious from this.

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:06.040
I just kind of put the negative
in the parentheses.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.260
Well the triangle inequality,
and this might seem a little

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.050
mundane to you, but it really
shows us that we can always

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:13.970
define a regular planar triangle
based on these

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.430
vectors in this way.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:19.070
It tells us this is less than or
equal to the length of our

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:24.150
vector a plus the length
of minus b.

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:26.680
And I just said and you could
prove it to yourself, that

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.660
this is the same thing
as the length of b.

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:32.130
So we just saw that
this is definitely

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:32.870
less than those two.

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:34.480
This is definitely less
than those two.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.290
And that is definitely
less than those two.

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:40.130
None of the reasons that would
keep us from constructing a

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:41.080
triangle are valid.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.710
So we can always construct a
triangle in this way from any

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:48.340
arbitrary nonzero
vectors in Rn.

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.260
We can always construct this.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:57.390
Now, to define an angle, let
me redraw it down here.

00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:00.820
Let me redraw the vectors, maybe
a little bit bigger.

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.920
That's vector a.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.390
This is vector b.

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:07.680
And then let me just
draw it this way.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.300
This is the vector
right there.

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:12.170
That is the vector a minus b.

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:14.360
And we said we're going to
define a corresponding

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:18.910
regular, run of the mill,
vanilla triangle whose lengths

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:22.600
are defined by the lengths
of the vectors,

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.710
by the vector lengths.

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:26.900
So this is the length
of b, that side.

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:31.340
This is the length
of a minus b.

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:33.890
And then this is the
length of a.

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:37.370
Now that I know that I can
always construct a triangle

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:41.080
like this, I can attempt to
define-- or actually, I will

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:45.480
define my definition of an angle
between two vectors.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.860
So we know what an angle
means in this context.

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:52.040
This is just a regular, run of
the mill, geometric triangle.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:55.430
Now, my definition of an angle
between two vectors I'm going

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:59.120
to say-- so this is what
I'm trying to define.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.900
This is what I'm going
to define.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.860
These can have arbitrary number
of components, so it's

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:04.720
hard to visualize.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:09.500
But I'm going to define this
angle as the corresponding

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:13.900
angle in a regular, run of the
mill triangle where the sides

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.460
of the run of the mill triangle
are the two vectors

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:19.420
and then the opposite side is
the subtraction, is the length

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:21.720
of the difference between
the two vectors.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.560
This is just the definition.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.935
I'm defining this, the angle
between two vectors in Rn that

00:11:28.935 --> 00:11:32.210
could have an arbitrary number
of components, I'm defining

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:36.770
this angle to be the same as
this angle, the angle between

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:40.860
the two sides, the two lengths
of those vectors in just a

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:43.380
regular, run of the
mill triangle.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.560
Now, what can I do with this?

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.300
Well, can we find a relationship
between all of

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.230
these things right here?

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:50.780
Well sure.

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:53.910
If you remember from your
trigonometry class, and if you

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:56.810
don't, I've proved it
in the playlist. You

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:58.060
have the law of cosines.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.860
And I'll do it with an arbitrary
triangle right here

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:06.320
just because I don't want
to confuse you.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:12.040
So if this is side a, b, and c
and this is theta, the law of

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:17.140
cosines tells us that c squared
is equal to a squared

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:23.080
plus b squared minus 2ab
cosine of theta.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.220
I always think of it as kind
of a broader Pythagorean

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:29.000
theorem because this
thing does not have

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.460
to be a right angle.

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:31.640
It accounts for all angles.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.100
If this becomes a right angle,
then this term disappears and

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.130
you're just left with the
Pythagorean theorem.

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:37.050
But we've proven this.

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:41.200
This applies to just regular,
run of the mill triangles.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.870
And lucky for us, we have a
regular, run of the mill

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.080
triangle here.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.580
So let's apply the law
of cosines to this

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.650
triangle right here.

00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:53.950
And the way I drew it,
they correspond.

00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:56.900
The length of this
side squared.

00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:03.420
So that means the length
of a minus b squared.

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.290
Length of vector a minus vector
b, that's just the

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:07.160
length of that side.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.490
So I'm just squaring
that side.

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:16.790
It equals the length of vector
b squared plus the length of

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:23.150
vector a squared minus 2 times
the length of-- I'll just

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:27.150
write two times length of vector
a times the length of

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:31.360
vector b times the cosine of
this angle right here.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.940
Times the cosine
of that angle.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:35.650
And I'm defining this angle
between these two vectors to

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:37.630
be the same as this
angle right there.

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:40.790
So if we know this angle, by
definition, we know that angle

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:41.970
right there.

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:45.210
Well, we know that the square
of our lengths of a vector

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:47.525
when we use our factor
definition of length, that

00:13:47.525 --> 00:13:50.960
this is just the same thing as
a vector dotted with itself.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:58.080
So that's a minus
b dot a minus b.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.530
It's all going to be equal to
this whole stuff on the

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:01.370
right-hand side.

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:02.780
But let me simplify
the left-hand

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:04.230
side of this equation.

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:10.350
a minus b dot a minus b, this is
the same thing as a dot a--

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:15.180
those two terms--
minus a dot b.

00:14:18.065 --> 00:14:20.650
And then I have minus b dot a.

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.390
Those two terms right there.

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:29.010
And then you have the
minus b dot minus b.

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:32.530
That's the same thing
as a plus b dot b.

00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:34.260
Remember, this is just a
simplification of the

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:35.640
left-hand side.

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:36.850
And I can rewrite this.

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:42.010
a dot a, we know that's just
the length of a squared.

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:44.210
a dot b and b dot a are
the same thing, so

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:45.460
we have two of these.

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:51.400
So this right here, this term
right there will simplify to

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:57.370
minus 2 times a dot b.

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:00.090
And then finally, b dot b.

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:03.120
We know that that's just the
length of b squared.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.700
I just simplified or maybe I
just expanded-- that's a

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:06.650
better word.

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:09.680
When you go from one term here
to three terms, you can't say

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:10.680
you simplified it.

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.400
But I expanded just the
left-hand side and so this has

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.520
to be equal to the right-hand
side by the law of cosines.

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:21.570
So that is equal to-- I almost
feel like instead of rewriting

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:23.130
it, let me just copy
and paste it.

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:29.490
What did I just do?

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:33.240
Copy, edit.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.620
Copy and paste.

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:36.810
There you go.

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:37.870
I don't know it that
was worth it.

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:40.350
But maybe I saved a little
bit of time.

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:44.810
So that is equal to
that right there.

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:46.170
And then we can simplify.

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:48.610
We have a length of a
squared here, length

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:49.590
of a squared there.

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:51.040
Subtract it from both sides.

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:54.270
The length of b squared here,
length of b squared there.

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:56.120
Subtract it from both sides.

00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:00.000
And then, what can we do?

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.770
We can divide both sides by
minus 2 because everything

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:04.100
else has disappeared.

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:08.960
And so that term and that term
will both become 1's.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:16.470
And all we're left with is the
vector a dot the vector b.

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:18.490
And this is interesting because
all of a sudden we're

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:19.860
getting a relationship
between the dot

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:21.200
products of two vectors.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.460
We've kind of gone away from
their definition by lengths.

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:29.740
But the dot product of two
vectors is equal to the

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:36.550
product of their lengths,
their vector lengths.

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:39.110
And they can have an arbitrary
number of components.

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:43.450
Times the cosine of the
angle between them.

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:46.300
Remember, this theta, I said
this is the same as when you

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:48.490
draw this kind of analogous,
regular triangle.

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:50.530
But I'm defining the angle
between them to

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:52.230
be the same as that.

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:56.610
So I can say that this is
the angle between them.

00:16:56.610 --> 00:17:00.290
And obviously, the idea of
between two vectors, it's hard

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:02.110
to visualize if you go beyond
three dimensions.

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:04.289
But now we have it at least,
mathematically defined.

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:11.310
So if you give me two vectors we
can now, using this formula

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:14.920
that we've proved using this
definition up here, we can now

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:19.410
calculate the angle between
any two vectors using this

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:20.510
right here.

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:28.319
And just to make it clear, what
happens if a is a-- and

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:30.270
maybe it's not clear from that
definition, so I'll make it

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:36.020
clearer here that by definition,
if a is equal to

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:40.660
some scalar multiple of b where
c is greater than 0,

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:46.190
we'll define theta
to be equal to 0.

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:50.000
And if c is less than 0, so a is
collinear, but goes in the

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.330
exact opposite direction, we'll
define theta to be equal

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:55.440
to 180 degrees.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.080
And that's consistent with what
we understand about just

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.620
two-dimensional vectors.

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:03.220
If they're collinear and
kind of the scalar

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:03.790
multiples the same.

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:07.460
That means a looks something
like that and b looks

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:08.940
something like that.

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:10.810
So we say oh, that's
a 0 angle.

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:15.010
And if they go the other way,
if a looks something like--

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:16.870
this is the case where a is
just going in the other

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:18.130
direction from b.

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:21.540
a goes like that and b goes like
that, we define the angle

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:24.310
between them to be
180 degrees.

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:26.690
But everything else is pretty
well defined by

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:27.750
the triangle example.

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:29.880
I had to make the special case
of these because it's not

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.620
clear you really get a triangle
in these cases

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:34.870
because the triangle
kind of disappears.

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:38.320
It flattens out if a and b are
on top of each other or if

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.940
they're going in the exact
opposite direction.

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:45.150
So that's why I wanted to make
a little bit of a side note

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:47.080
right there.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:53.130
Now, using this definition of
the angle between the vectors,

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:57.440
we can now define the idea
of perpendicular vectors.

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.660
So we can now say perpendicular
vectors-- this

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:06.100
is another definition-- and
this won't be earth

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:09.220
shattering, but it kind of is
because we've generalized this

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:11.570
to vectors that have an
arbitrary number of

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:12.000
components.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.590
We're defining perpendicular
to mean the theta between--

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:22.890
two vectors a and b are
perpendicular if the angle

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:29.520
between them is 90 degrees.

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:30.550
And we can define that.

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:34.880
We can take two vectors,
dot them.

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.110
Take their dot product.

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:38.660
Figure out their two lengths and
then you could figure out

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:39.760
the angle between them.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.080
And if it's 90 degrees.

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:45.460
you can say that they are
perpendicular angles.

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:47.880
And I want to be very clear here
that this is actually not

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.640
defined for the 0 vector
right here.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:57.240
So this situation right here,
not defined for the 0 vector.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.660
Because if you have the 0
vector, then this quantity

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:02.760
right here is going to be 0 and
then this quantity right

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:03.810
here is going to be 0.

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:06.600
And there's no clear definition
for your angle.

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:11.300
If this is 0 right here, you
did 0 is equal to 0 times

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:12.940
cosine of theta.

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:15.610
And so if you wanted to solve
for theta you'd get cosine of

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:19.810
theta is equal to 0/0,
which is undefined.

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:29.200
But what we can do is create a
slightly more general word

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.300
than the word perpendicular.

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:35.530
So you have to have a defined
angle to even talk about

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:36.400
perpendicular.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:39.010
If the angle between two vectors
is 90 degrees, we're

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:43.170
saying by definition, those two
vectors are perpendicular.

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:46.360
But what if we made the
statement and we can-- if you

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:48.460
look at them, if the angle
between two vectors is 90

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:51.190
degrees, what does that mean?

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:53.180
So let's say that theta
is 90 degrees.

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:56.370
Let me draw a line here.

00:20:56.370 --> 00:20:58.060
Let's say that theta
is 90 degrees.

00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:00.420
Theta is equal to 90 degrees.

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:02.260
What does this formula
tell us?

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:07.960
It tells us that a dot b is
equal to the length of a times

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:12.450
the length of b times cosine
of 90 degrees.

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:14.180
What's cosine of 90 degrees?

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:15.220
It's 0.

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:18.610
You can review your unit circle
if that doesn't make a

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:18.850
lot of sense.

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:21.070
But that is equal to 0, so this
whole term is going to be

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:22.370
equal to 0.

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:27.400
So if theta is equal to
90 degrees, then a dot

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:31.220
b is equal to 0.

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:36.320
And so this is another
interesting takeaway.

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:45.690
If a and b are perpendicular,
then their dot product is

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:49.020
going to be equal to 0.

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:52.330
Now if their dot product is
equal to 0, can we necessarily

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:54.470
say that they are
perpendicular?

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:59.120
Well what if a or b
is the 0 vector?

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:02.820
The 0 vector-- let me call
it z for 0 vector.

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:04.070
Or I could just draw.

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:10.590
The 0 vector dot anything is
always going to be equal to 0.

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:12.970
So does that mean that the 0
vector is perpendicular to

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:13.670
everything?

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:14.570
Well no.

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:19.320
Because the 0 vector I said, we
have to have the notion of

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.550
an angle between things in
order to use the word

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:22.170
perpendicular.

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:25.340
So we can't use the 0 vector.

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:28.280
We can't say just because two
vectors dot products are equal

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.200
to 0 that they are
perpendicular.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.460
And that's because the 0 vector
would mess that up

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:34.500
because the 0 vector
is not defined.

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:38.810
But if we say, and we have been
saying, that a and b are

00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:47.660
nonzero, if they are nonzero
vectors, then we can say that

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:50.350
if a and b are nonzero and their
dot product is equal to

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:52.370
0, then a and b are
perpendicular.

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:54.190
So now it goes both ways.

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:56.960
But what if we just have this
condition right here?

00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:00.440
What if we just have the
condition that a dot b is

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:01.200
equal to 0?

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:05.040
It seems like that's kind of
just a simple, pure condition.

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.740
And we can write a
word for that.

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:08.790
And these words are often used
synonymously, but hopefully

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:10.480
you understand the
distinction now.

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:17.110
We can say that if two vectors
dot product is equal to 0, we

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:18.930
will call them orthogonal.

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:29.250
As I always say, spelling
isn't my best subject.

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:30.880
But this is kind
of a neat idea.

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:36.010
This tells us that-- well, that
all perpendicular vectors

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:37.690
are orthogonal.

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:50.780
And it also tells us that the
0 vector is orthogonal to

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:52.460
everything else.

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:55.570
To everything, even to itself.

00:23:55.570 --> 00:23:57.860
The 0 dot 0 vector
you still get 0.

00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:59.820
So by definition,
it's orthogonal.

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:03.080
So for the first time probably
in your mathematical career,

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:06.110
you're seeing that the words--
you know, every time you first

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:08.220
got exposed to the words
perpendicular and orthogonal

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:10.950
in geometry or maybe in physics
or wherever else, they

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:13.200
were always kind of
the same words.

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:16.230
But now I'm introducing a nice,
little distinction here

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:17.880
and you can kind of be a little

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:19.610
smart aleck with teachers.

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:22.040
Oh, you know, it's perpendicular
only is the

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:24.810
vectors aren't-- if neither
of them are 0 vector.

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:27.290
Otherwise, if their dot product
is 0, you can only say

00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:28.250
that they're orthogonal.

00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:29.730
But if they're nonzero you
could say that they're

00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:31.105
orthogonal and perpendicular.

00:24:31.105 --> 00:24:33.280
But anyway, I thought that I
would introduce this little

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:35.455
distinction for you in case you
have someone that likes to

00:24:35.455 --> 00:24:37.050
trip you up with words.

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:39.900
But it also I think highlights
that we are building a

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:42.310
mathematics from the ground up
and we have to be careful

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:43.270
about the words we use.

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:46.040
And we have to be very precise
about our definitions.

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:47.770
Because if we're not precise
about our definitions and we

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:50.200
build up a bunch of mathematics
on top of this and

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:53.260
do a bunch of proofs, one day we
might scratch our heads and

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:55.040
read some type of
weird ambiguity.

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:57.660
And it might have all came out
of the fact that we weren't

00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:01.110
precise enough in defining what
some of these terms mean.

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:03.470
Well anyway, hopefully you
found this useful.

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:06.650
We can now take the angle or we
can now determine the angle

00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:09.340
between vectors with an
arbitrary number of

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:10.590
components.
