00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.370
NARRATOR: At the start of the
1900s,

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.630
Americans couldn't even envision
a future that included trucks.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.070
If you think about the
early part of the 1900s,

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.730
we were still in the
horse and buggy era.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.800
NARRATOR: Between actual
horses and iron horses,

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.130
our hauling needs were met.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.000
Adding an automotive option
seemed an absurd indulgence.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.430
Keep in mind, at that
point, the automobile

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.330
was a very sophisticated thing,
and rich people had them.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.330
NARRATOR: But the auto
world would soon give rise

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.470
to two familiar names
who would become

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.200
the first titans of trucks.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.430
And their battles of innovation
began early, when one of them

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.970
first made vehicles affordable.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.370
His name was Ransom E. Olds.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.130
ROBERT GABRICK: Ransom E. Olds
is one of these self made men,

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.770
who starts out working
in the machine shop

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.070
and becomes very successful
in the development of engines

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.570
and, of course, the motor car.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.830
JEFF GLUCKER: He was a very
smart guy, ahead of his time.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.400
I think at one point, he had
11 prototype vehicles made over

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.570
the course of like a few years.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.270
There was a gas one, a steam
one, and even an electric one.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.000
NARRATOR: But in 1904, Ransom's
relations with his investors

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.670
soured, forcing him to walk away
from the company he founded.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.170
So he left Oldsmobile behind,
and formed a new company,

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.270
using his initials
as the name, REO.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.570
He was the only Detroit
manufacturer to have two

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.330
car companies named after him.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.770
NARRATOR: Ransom Olds
was now in position

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.100
to become a godfather
of the truck industry,

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.130
but he wasn't yet
ready to strike.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.870
It was the other soon to be
titan who fired the first shot

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.470
in the truck wars, Henry Fold.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.000
Ford first began
making cars in 1901,

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.530
joining a booming
industry that saw

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.070
the number of autos on
the road go from 8,000

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.100
in 1900 to 78,000 in 1905.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.530
Ford, sensing an
opportunity, tried

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.830
to get a jump on the
market for a light duty

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.830
truck with the Model E.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.700
The Model E delivery car
was Ford's first real attempt

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.100
at like a commercial vehicle.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.200
It was about $950 in 1905,
which was a lot of money.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.300
And they really only
sold 10 of them.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.470
So it wasn't exactly a triumph.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.600
NARRATOR: Ford would
lick his wounds,

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.600
learn from his mistakes, and go
on to perfect his passenger car

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.930
design with the iconic Model T.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.570
REPORTER: In 1909 came
the revolutionary Model T.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.500
1,700 were produced in that
first year, a miracle of

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.630
mass production for the time.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.530
NARRATOR: Ford stormed to
the top of the car world.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.130
But his earlier Model E flop
made him gun shy of entering

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.730
the truck market again.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.100
So his customers started
doing it themselves,

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.100
kickstarting a truck
modding scene that's

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.630
still going strong today.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.430
Ford was convinced that
all America needed to get by

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.170
was the Model T. He was wrong.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.770
ERIC NOBLE: It was
farmers saying,

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.530
old Bessie can only
go 12 miles today.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.270
I need to go 15 or 20.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.570
What I want to do is take the
bed off the back of my farm

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.830
wagon, and I'm going to
just figure out how to put

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.430
that on the back of my Model T.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.630
MATT ANDERSON: Americans
are an inventive bunch.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.000
And if we want something,
we'll find a way to get it,

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.430
whether we have to go to
someone to build it for us,

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.230
or whether we just have
to build it ourselves.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.430
NARRATOR: Yet, despite the
obvious demand for trucks,

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.100
Henry Ford still wasn't
ready to jump in.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.170
Instead, he would be
beaten to the punch

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.370
once again by a familiar
competitor, Ransom Olds, whose

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.100
breakthrough design was
arguably the most influential

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.270
civilian truck of all time.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.500
In 1915, the REO Motor Company
released the iconic REO

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.500
Speedwagon, scoring the first
major victory in the battle

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.870
for truck supremacy.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.400
And while most autos were
stuck at the piddling industry

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.800
standard of 15 miles per
hour, the Speedwagon was

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.700
20% faster, earning its name.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.300
It was also one of
the first trucks

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.530
to sport an electric
starter and pneumatic tires.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.700
Combine those game changing
upgrades with its quickness,

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.730
and the Speedwagon blew
the doors open on what

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.970
a civilian truck could be.

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.900
STACEY DAVID: Crank
starting a car,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.770
you know how you get on a car
now, and you hit the starter

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.570
and you let it wind, think
of that with your arm.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.930
If it kicks back and
you're not ready for it,

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.170
it can break your arm.

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:20.930
It is not something that
you just do on a whim.

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.200
JASON TORCHINSKY:
Utility vehicles

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.800
and hauling vehicles before
then had hard rubber tires.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.730
So pneumatic tires made
the ride softer and better.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.900
And if you had cargo
that was fragile,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.300
it was that much less shock
that you'd have on it.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.930
NARRATOR: The Speedwagon
came out of the gate

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.300
with approximately 13,000
units in annual sales,

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.100
an impressive mark
considering its hefty price

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.370
of around $1,000.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.400
It would also evolve
into numerous models,

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.900
from fire duty to farm duty,
over an impressive 38 year

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.870
run proving that trucks
were here to stay.

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.770
