00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:01.801 align:start position:0%
Hey, Dad.

00:00:01.834 --> 00:00:03.936 align:start position:0%
I have a really
exciting idea, okay?

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:05.505 align:start position:0%
You seem pretty
lonely in here,

00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:07.974 align:start position:0%
and something pretty
exciting is going on

00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:10.043 align:start position:0%
just across the road
over there.

00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:11.677
Uh...

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.982
Dad, don't you want
to lead a five-star life?

00:00:16.015 --> 00:00:20.086 align:start size:75% position:25%
Yeah, um...I am worried.

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.090 align:end position:100%
You know, worried
is not the right word.

00:00:24.123 --> 00:00:27.260 align:start size:50% position:50%
I'm wondering...

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:29.195 align:end position:100%
slash worried
that this might turn out

00:00:29.228 --> 00:00:34.734 align:end position:100%
like the model-airplane
club sophomore year.

00:00:34.767 --> 00:00:36.869
This isn't gonna be
anything like that, Dad.

00:00:36.902 --> 00:00:40.039
For one thing, my followers
love me out there.

00:00:40.072 --> 00:00:42.408
(Forrest voice-over)
It was a low blow for my father
to bring up

00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:45.445
my disastrous leadership
of Model Airplane Club.

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:47.447
Now I was determined
to prove to him

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.183
that I could lead a cult
as well as anyone.

00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:54.554
I began following the wisdom

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:57.723
of cult leaders
who had succeeded before me.

00:00:57.756 --> 00:01:00.293
First, I granted myself
the extraordinary power

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:03.162
of absolving the sins
of my followers.

00:01:03.195 --> 00:01:05.731 align:end position:100%
Who else has a burden
to unleash?

00:01:05.764 --> 00:01:08.234 align:end position:100%
I stole money from
the pension fund at work.

00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:10.570 align:start size:69% position:31%
The stars absolve you!

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:13.506
(all)
One, two, three, four, five!

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:16.275
I cheated on my husband
with a total stranger.

00:01:16.308 --> 00:01:18.578 align:end position:100%
The stars definitely
absolve you.

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:21.747
(all)
One, two, three, four, five!

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.382
I hit a homeless man
with my car,

00:01:23.415 --> 00:01:24.884
and I just kept driving.

00:01:24.917 --> 00:01:28.087
- Seriously?
- Yeah, I did.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.656 align:start size:69% position:31%
The stars absolve you!

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.593
(all)
One, two, three, four, five!

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:36.162 align:end position:100%
My children,
I have taken your sins

00:01:36.195 --> 00:01:38.331 align:end position:100%
and transgressions
and crimes,

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:40.233 align:start size:59% position:41%
and I have banished
them into the deep,

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:41.934 align:start size:59% position:41%
dark void of space.

00:01:41.967 --> 00:01:44.670
- We are free!
- [cheers and applause]

00:01:44.703 --> 00:01:48.274
(Forrest voice-over)
Then, to keep everyone focused
on me and being more like me,

00:01:48.307 --> 00:01:50.076
I instituted a new uniform.

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:52.111
- Here.
- We have a new uniform!

00:01:52.144 --> 00:01:53.446
(Forrest voice-over)
And a reward system.

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.348
As you earn each level,

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:57.416
you will get a new piece
of clothing.

00:01:57.449 --> 00:02:00.052
The first level
of achievement is shirts.

00:02:00.085 --> 00:02:01.888 align:start size:78% position:22%
Th second level is pants.

00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:03.856 align:end position:100%
Let's hope you get
to that one soon.

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:07.793 align:end position:100%
The third level is jacket.
The fourth level is tie.

00:02:07.826 --> 00:02:12.198 align:end position:100%
And level five--the glasses
of enhanced sight.

00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:14.133
(Forrest voice-over)
And it was all working
beautifully.

00:02:14.166 --> 00:02:16.302
(Forrest)
Congratulations.
You've attained Shirt Level.

00:02:16.335 --> 00:02:17.937
(Forrest voice-over)
Two months into our time
together,

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.139
the members
of my rapidly growing family

00:02:20.172 --> 00:02:22.775
were beginning
to treat me like a messiah.

00:02:22.808 --> 00:02:24.177
[applause]

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.978
And I liked being a messiah.

00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:28.281 align:end position:100%
Cosmic Father, this is all
I have in the world,

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:30.783 align:end position:100%
made out to you
in a cashier's check.

00:02:30.816 --> 00:02:32.652
- Congratulations.
- Yes, indeed.

00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:35.855 align:start position:0%
Cosmic Father,
it's my father's old watch.

00:02:35.888 --> 00:02:37.323 align:start position:0%
You're my father now.

00:02:37.356 --> 00:02:40.693
- One, two three--
(all) Four, five.

00:02:40.726 --> 00:02:42.461 align:start size:22% position:78%
Rachel?

00:02:42.494 --> 00:02:44.864 align:end position:100%
You haven't surrendered
your assets to the movement yet.

00:02:44.897 --> 00:02:47.833 align:end position:100%
I just don't think I can,
Cosmic Father.

00:02:47.866 --> 00:02:49.535 align:end position:100%
Well, I would hate
for anyone to find out

00:02:49.568 --> 00:02:53.306 align:end position:100%
about the man that you
hit with your car.

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:55.041 align:end position:100%
A cashier's check
will be just fine.

00:02:55.074 --> 00:02:57.877
(all)
One, two, three, four, five.
