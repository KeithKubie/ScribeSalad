00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640
- [Voiceover] We've already payed a lot of attention

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.448
to the molecular structure of DNA.

00:00:03.448 --> 00:00:06.435
In fact right depicted in front of us, we have two strands

00:00:06.435 --> 00:00:09.280
of DNA forming a double helix,

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.733
and we can look at the telltale signs that this is DNA.

00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:15.619
In particular, we can look at the five-carbon sugar

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:17.081
on it's backbone.

00:00:17.081 --> 00:00:19.174
We see, and let's actually number the carbons.

00:00:19.174 --> 00:00:24.102
This is 1', 2', 3', 4', 5'.

00:00:24.902 --> 00:00:27.057
We can see on the 2' carbon

00:00:27.057 --> 00:00:29.028
we don't have an oxygen attached to it.

00:00:29.028 --> 00:00:31.080
We don't have a hydroxyl group attached to it,

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.761
and because of that, we know that this is not ribose.

00:00:33.761 --> 00:00:37.906
This is deoxyribose. This right over here is deoxyribose.

00:00:37.906 --> 00:00:40.141
And these two are also deoxyribose,

00:00:40.141 --> 00:00:42.294
so that tells us that we have two strands

00:00:42.294 --> 00:00:46.037
of DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid.

00:00:46.037 --> 00:00:47.577
So let me write this down.

00:00:47.577 --> 00:00:49.746
This part of the chain,

00:00:49.746 --> 00:00:53.245
this is derived from a deoxyribose being attached

00:00:53.245 --> 00:00:56.281
to phosphate groups and a nitrogenous base.

00:00:56.281 --> 00:01:01.011
So deoxyribose.

00:01:02.811 --> 00:01:04.721
So, what would we have to do if we wanted,

00:01:04.721 --> 00:01:06.225
instead of viewing this

00:01:06.225 --> 00:01:10.105
as two strands of DNA in a double helix formation,

00:01:10.105 --> 00:01:14.068
how would we have to edit the left hand strand,

00:01:14.068 --> 00:01:15.591
if instead we wanted to imagine

00:01:15.591 --> 00:01:18.029
that the left hand strand is a messenger RNA

00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:21.341
being generated during transcription

00:01:21.341 --> 00:01:24.429
with a single strand of DNA here on the right?

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:28.758
Well, to turn this into RNA, or to make it look like RNA,

00:01:28.758 --> 00:01:32.637
on the 2' carbon, well, we want to turn the deoxyribose

00:01:32.637 --> 00:01:35.360
into just ribose, so we would want to add

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.236
a hydroxyl group right over here.

00:01:40.236 --> 00:01:42.257
So I add a hydroxyl group over there,

00:01:42.257 --> 00:01:45.787
actually do the hydrogens in white.

00:01:45.787 --> 00:01:48.377
So add one hydroxyl group there,

00:01:48.377 --> 00:01:49.724
and I want to do on all the sugars

00:01:49.724 --> 00:01:51.660
on the left strand's backbone

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.012
if I want this to be a single strand of RNA,

00:01:55.012 --> 00:01:57.270
and RNA tends to be single stranded.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.854
So oxygen, and then a hydrogen.

00:02:01.854 --> 00:02:05.639
So adding this hydroxyl group instead of

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:09.473
just having another hydrogen,

00:02:09.473 --> 00:02:12.456
this tells us that this sugar is no long deoxyribose.

00:02:12.456 --> 00:02:13.766
This is ribose.

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:18.906
So we now have ribose in our backbone,

00:02:19.216 --> 00:02:21.240
which is a telltale sign that

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.122
at least now we have the backbone of RNA, ribonucleic acid,

00:02:25.122 --> 00:02:28.678
versus DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid.

00:02:28.678 --> 00:02:31.989
Now, you might think we're done, but we're not quite done,

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.667
because the nitrogenous bases on RNA are slightly different

00:02:35.667 --> 00:02:38.755
than the nitrogenous bases on DNA.

00:02:38.755 --> 00:02:43.536
On DNA, your nitrogenous bases are

00:02:43.536 --> 00:02:48.316
Adenine, Guanine.

00:02:48.316 --> 00:02:52.800
Adenine and Guanine are the two ringed nitrogenous bases.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.664
Right over here, this is Adenine.

00:02:54.664 --> 00:02:56.288
This is Guanine.

00:02:56.288 --> 00:03:01.116
And you also have Cytosine

00:03:01.116 --> 00:03:06.056
I'm gonna do these all in different colors.

00:03:06.056 --> 00:03:11.066
Cytosine and Thymine.

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:12.956
And this right over is Cytosine,

00:03:12.956 --> 00:03:14.596
and this is Thymine,

00:03:14.596 --> 00:03:18.251
Cytosine and Thymine are single ringed nitrogenous bases.

00:03:18.251 --> 00:03:19.649
We called them pyrimidines.

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:21.584
Adenine and Guanine, we call them purines.

00:03:21.584 --> 00:03:24.044
This is a little bit of a review.

00:03:24.464 --> 00:03:29.248
In RNA, you still have Adenine.

00:03:29.258 --> 00:03:32.903
You still have Guanine.

00:03:32.903 --> 00:03:36.008
You still have Cytosine,

00:03:36.008 --> 00:03:40.885
but instead of Thymine, you have a very close relative,

00:03:40.885 --> 00:03:44.420
and that is Uracil.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.471
So the way that this is drawn right now,

00:03:46.471 --> 00:03:49.906
this nitrogenous base, remember when we started this video,

00:03:49.906 --> 00:03:52.658
it was double stranded DNA,

00:03:52.658 --> 00:03:55.519
this nitrogenous base right over here is Thymine,

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.352
and it forms hydrogen bonds with Adenine right over here.

00:03:59.352 --> 00:04:01.242
If I want to turn it to Uracil,

00:04:01.242 --> 00:04:06.203
I just have to get rid of this methyl group right over here,

00:04:06.203 --> 00:04:11.149
so if I just do this and replace it with a Hydrogen,

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:13.608
that is just implicitly bonded there,

00:04:13.608 --> 00:04:17.466
well, now I'm dealing with Uracil.

00:04:17.466 --> 00:04:21.999
So you see that Uracil and Thymine are very close molecules

00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:24.762
or very similar nitrogenous bases,

00:04:24.762 --> 00:04:27.688
and that's why they can play a very similar role.

00:04:27.688 --> 00:04:32.442
And it's still the case, what Uracil pairs with,

00:04:32.442 --> 00:04:35.590
it pairs with Adenine, the same thing Thymine pairs with.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.375
And everything else is, of course, still the same.

00:04:38.375 --> 00:04:43.657
An interesting question is why Uracil? Why not Thymine?

00:04:43.657 --> 00:04:46.258
Or you can say why Thymine? Why not Uracil?

00:04:46.258 --> 00:04:49.508
And based on what I've read, it actually turns out

00:04:49.508 --> 00:04:53.247
that Uracil is a little bit more error prone.

00:04:53.247 --> 00:04:55.543
It might be able to bond with other things.

00:04:55.543 --> 00:05:00.422
When you're coating, it's a little less stable than Thymine.

00:05:00.422 --> 00:05:06.801
So Uracil makes the RNA molecule,

00:05:06.801 --> 00:05:10.235
or actually makes the machinery of information transfer,

00:05:10.235 --> 00:05:12.307
it makes it less stable.

00:05:12.307 --> 00:05:16.878
It's a less stable way to transfer information.

00:05:16.878 --> 00:05:21.328
Based on what I've read, in evolutionary history,

00:05:21.328 --> 00:05:25.249
RNA molecules, most people believe, predate DNA molecules.

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:28.703
So in the early stages, you had a lot of change,

00:05:28.703 --> 00:05:30.566
and so Uracil molecules were just fine,

00:05:30.566 --> 00:05:33.465
and there was a lot of errors and whatever else.

00:05:33.465 --> 00:05:36.464
But then information needed to be a little more persistent

00:05:36.464 --> 00:05:38.475
and a little less error prone, well then,

00:05:38.475 --> 00:05:42.681
Thymine helped stabilize things.

00:05:42.681 --> 00:05:45.769
There's also the view, "why has Uracil stuck around?"

00:05:45.769 --> 00:05:48.998
Well, RNA molecules, they have all of these roles in cells.

00:05:48.998 --> 00:05:51.682
Messenger RNA molecules are taking information

00:05:51.682 --> 00:05:54.018
from the DNA and getting it transcribed

00:05:54.018 --> 00:05:58.061
or getting it translated at the ribosome.

00:05:58.061 --> 00:05:59.685
But they shouldn't hang out forever.

00:05:59.685 --> 00:06:02.003
You actually want them to be somewhat unstable.

00:06:02.003 --> 00:06:04.055
So it's an interesting question to think about.

00:06:04.055 --> 00:06:06.391
Why do we have Uracil instead of Thymine,

00:06:06.391 --> 00:06:08.362
or why do we have Thymine instead of Uracil?

00:06:08.362 --> 00:06:10.739
But this is one of the telltale signs of,

00:06:10.739 --> 00:06:14.396
that we are now dealing with an RNA molecule.

00:06:14.396 --> 00:06:17.088
So now what we have on the left hand side,

00:06:17.088 --> 00:06:18.858
Now, all of this business,

00:06:18.858 --> 00:06:20.948
actually let me do this in a different color.

00:06:20.948 --> 00:06:25.193
all of this business, this strand right over here,

00:06:25.193 --> 00:06:27.605
we can now, the way it's drawn,

00:06:27.605 --> 00:06:29.511
we can now consider this an RNA molecule,

00:06:29.511 --> 00:06:33.088
and if we assume that this is happening during transcription

00:06:33.088 --> 00:06:35.751
where a single strand of DNA would want

00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:37.597
to replicate it's information,

00:06:37.597 --> 00:06:42.337
then this over here would be mRNA, messenger RNA,

00:06:42.337 --> 00:06:44.323
and so what's going on here?

00:06:44.323 --> 00:06:45.603
Well, let's think about it.

00:06:45.603 --> 00:06:50.787
The messenger RNA, the way it's oriented,

00:06:51.637 --> 00:06:54.358
if we go, we have phosphate group,

00:06:54.358 --> 00:06:57.716
then we go to 5' carbon, 4', 3', then phosphate group,

00:06:57.716 --> 00:07:00.373
then 5', 4', 3', then phosphate group,

00:07:00.373 --> 00:07:05.046
so this is oriented 5' on top, 3' on the bottom,

00:07:05.046 --> 00:07:07.742
while these DNA molecules are oriented the other way.

00:07:07.742 --> 00:07:10.227
This is a 5' carbon. This is a 3' carbon,

00:07:10.227 --> 00:07:12.929
so we have phosphate, 3', 5', phosphate,

00:07:12.929 --> 00:07:17.865
so we have 3' is on top, and 5' is on the bottom.

00:07:17.865 --> 00:07:21.097
So if we wanted to think about what's happening,

00:07:21.097 --> 00:07:23.555
maybe using the symbols for the nitrogenous bases,

00:07:23.555 --> 00:07:28.167
we could say, all right we have our mRNA molecule here,

00:07:28.167 --> 00:07:33.470
and this is it's 5' end, and this is it's 3' end,

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:38.569
and then the top nitrogenous base over here, this is Uracil.

00:07:41.889 --> 00:07:47.123
And then the second one over here, this is Cytosine.

00:07:47.123 --> 00:07:50.475
This is Cytosine.

00:07:50.475 --> 00:07:56.449
This is Cytosine over here, and this is being transcribed

00:07:56.449 --> 00:08:00.471
from this DNA molecule on the right hand side,

00:08:00.471 --> 00:08:04.595
so this is DNA, and this DNA has an antiparallel orientation

00:08:04.595 --> 00:08:06.546
It's parallel, but it's kinda flipped over.

00:08:06.546 --> 00:08:10.914
The sugars are pointed in a different direction,

00:08:10.914 --> 00:08:13.879
so this is going from the 3' end.

00:08:13.879 --> 00:08:16.064
This is the 5' end.

00:08:16.064 --> 00:08:20.158
And we see that the Uracil is hydrogen bonded to Adenine.

00:08:20.158 --> 00:08:24.996
That is Adenine

00:08:26.106 --> 00:08:29.987
And I'll draw dotted lines to show the hydrogen bonds.

00:08:29.987 --> 00:08:34.578
And that the Cytosine is hydrogen bonded to Guanine.

00:08:34.578 --> 00:08:38.690
So this right over here, that is Guanine.

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:42.309
Actually I'll do the hydrogen bonds in white.

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:45.427
Actually there's multiple hydrogen bonds going on here,

00:08:45.427 --> 00:08:49.532
but just to be clear, this is mRNA,

00:08:49.532 --> 00:08:52.197
and on the right, we have DNA.

00:08:52.197 --> 00:08:56.615
This could be happening during transcription.

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.387
Now, what are the types of RNAs out there?

00:09:05.387 --> 00:09:07.093
We've talked about this in other videos.

00:09:07.093 --> 00:09:09.983
Well, you have messenger RNA, which has an important role

00:09:09.983 --> 00:09:11.989
in taking information from DNA

00:09:11.989 --> 00:09:13.915
and getting it eventually translated

00:09:13.915 --> 00:09:16.460
with the help of tRNAs in ribosomes,

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:19.385
and though I've just mentioned another type of RNA,

00:09:19.385 --> 00:09:24.757
and that's transfer RNA, so transfer RNA, tRNA.

00:09:28.407 --> 00:09:31.962
And in the overview video on transcription and translation,

00:09:31.962 --> 00:09:33.770
we talk about how tRNA does this,

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:39.032
but it has amino acids attached on one end,

00:09:39.032 --> 00:09:41.916
and then it has anticodons on the other end

00:09:41.916 --> 00:09:48.748
that essentially pair with codons on the mRNA,

00:09:48.748 --> 00:09:51.202
and, then, thus allows it to construct proteins.

00:09:51.202 --> 00:09:56.056
And actually, this right over here is a visualization

00:09:56.056 --> 00:10:01.380
of a tRNA molecule.

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:04.814
So a lot of times when we think about DNA,

00:10:04.814 --> 00:10:08.329
we think about, okay, mRNA or RNA is an intermediary

00:10:08.329 --> 00:10:10.991
to be able to eventually translate it into proteins,

00:10:10.991 --> 00:10:13.286
and that is often the case, but sometimes,

00:10:13.286 --> 00:10:15.643
you also just want the RNA itself.

00:10:15.643 --> 00:10:18.508
The RNA itself plays a role in the cell

00:10:18.508 --> 00:10:20.702
beyond just transmitting information,

00:10:20.702 --> 00:10:22.856
and that's an example here with tRNA.

00:10:22.856 --> 00:10:25.049
And you can see it's an interesting configuration,

00:10:25.049 --> 00:10:28.565
where the amino acid will attach roughly in that area,

00:10:28.565 --> 00:10:32.222
and then you see the anticodon

00:10:32.222 --> 00:10:34.618
right down here in the bottom right,

00:10:34.618 --> 00:10:37.240
and different tRNA molecules will attach

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.990
to different amino acids,

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:41.161
and they'll have different anticodons here.

00:10:41.161 --> 00:10:43.559
So this is another use for RNA,

00:10:43.559 --> 00:10:47.642
and then others include ribosomal RNA,

00:10:49.952 --> 00:10:53.128
and they actually play a structural role in ribosomes,

00:10:53.128 --> 00:10:56.033
which is where translation occurs.

00:10:56.033 --> 00:10:59.122
And you also have things called microRNA,

00:11:00.142 --> 00:11:03.390
which are short chains of RNA,

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:06.923
which could be used to regulate the translation

00:11:06.923 --> 00:11:09.260
of other RNA molecules.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.776
So DNA gets a lot of the attention,

00:11:11.776 --> 00:11:14.115
but RNA is really, really, really important,

00:11:14.115 --> 00:11:16.147
and a lot of people believe that RNA came first,

00:11:16.147 --> 00:11:18.484
and there's potential that the first life

00:11:18.484 --> 00:11:22.242
or pseudo-life ever was just self-replicating RNA molecules,

00:11:22.242 --> 00:11:25.573
and that DNA eventually evolved from RNA,

00:11:25.573 --> 00:11:29.075
but RNA stuck around, because it's still very useful.
