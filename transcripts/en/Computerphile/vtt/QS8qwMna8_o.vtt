00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.900
You are no longer a big user of email.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.320
that's true

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.160
can you tell me about your attitude to email then

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.980
and is it something other people should consider, is it just specific?

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.380
well as i said, I am a special case

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:18.700
I'm not...my role in life is not to be on the top of things as much as to be on the bottom of things...

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:28.440
it's best, often for me to be a bit of a hermit and have time for

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.140
things that require long attention spans with no interruptions

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.240
email, the name of the game is interruption

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.900
on the other hand I do impose on other people and ask them random questions

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:51.900
But starting about 1990 I realised that I had started using email in 1975

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.120
and 15 years of it was a lifetimes worth as far as I could see

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.660
because I had become like a random oracle,

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.020
people all over would just ask me random questions

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.420
and I would dutifully reply!

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.960
Not only that but as an author I....[email ping]

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.400
don't want to just dash something off but I would read it off and make sure that my sentences are well constructed

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.040
and spelled correctly and so on

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.020
so it took me a long time and it turned out that I would start out with

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.760
an idea of what I was going to do that day and 4 hours later I would say

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.260
'ok now, let me try and go forward after processing email'

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.840
[email ping]

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:44.600
On the other hand I sent a question to a guy...I mean I had my secretary send a question to a guy last week

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.060
and I am disturbed that he hasn't replied yet!

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.300
so I am not being fair

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.760
I am imposing on other people

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.700
but not letting them impose on me

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.860
'Do people bring it up with you?'

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.600
The main problem is that they try to go through my wife

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:09.820
and bother her so I have to try to stop that as soon as I can.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:18.060
It was an indescribably great experience, it really was because there were so many people there who were so good

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.980
and the environment was totally open and supportive

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.900
If you had a problem, it was like the quarters of the building. Everybody's office door was open

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.900
You could say, "I have a problem"

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.360
to anybody and they would try and help you, they would drop whatever they were doing
