00:00:06.692 --> 00:00:10.852
Imagine that one day,
you're summoned before a government panel.

00:00:10.852 --> 00:00:13.307
Even though you haven't 
committed any crime,

00:00:13.307 --> 00:00:15.612
or been formally charged with one,

00:00:15.612 --> 00:00:19.062
you are repeatedly questioned
about your political views,

00:00:19.062 --> 00:00:21.083
accused of disloyalty,

00:00:21.083 --> 00:00:25.652
and asked to incriminate your friends
and associates.

00:00:25.652 --> 00:00:30.482
If you don't cooperate,
you risk jail or losing your job.

00:00:30.482 --> 00:00:35.062
This is exactly what happened in
the United States in the 1950s

00:00:35.062 --> 00:00:40.173
as part of a campaign to expose
suspected communists.

00:00:40.173 --> 00:00:42.962
Named after its most 
notorious practitioner,

00:00:42.962 --> 00:00:49.573
the phenomenon known as McCarthyism
destroyed thousands of lives and careers.

00:00:49.573 --> 00:00:54.402
For over a decade, American political 
leaders trampled democratic freedoms

00:00:54.402 --> 00:00:57.274
in the name of protecting them.

00:00:57.274 --> 00:00:59.418
During the 1930s and 1940s,

00:00:59.418 --> 00:01:04.313
there had been an active but small
communist party in the United States.

00:01:04.313 --> 00:01:06.322
Its record was mixed.

00:01:06.322 --> 00:01:09.443
While it played crucial roles in wider 
progressive struggles

00:01:09.443 --> 00:01:11.484
for labor and civil rights,

00:01:11.484 --> 00:01:14.794
it also supported the Soviet Union.

00:01:14.794 --> 00:01:18.163
From the start, the American 
Communist Party faced attacks

00:01:18.163 --> 00:01:20.793
from conservatives and business leaders,

00:01:20.793 --> 00:01:26.083
as well as from liberals who criticized
its ties to the oppressive Soviet regime.

00:01:26.083 --> 00:01:30.784
During World War II, when the USA
and USSR were allied against Hitler,

00:01:30.784 --> 00:01:35.333
some American communists actually
spied for the Russians.

00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:38.965
When the Cold War escalated
and this espionage became known,

00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:43.814
domestic communism came to be seen
as a threat to national security.

00:01:43.814 --> 00:01:45.754
But the attempt to eliminate that threat

00:01:45.754 --> 00:01:49.213
soon turned into the longest lasting
and most widespread episode

00:01:49.213 --> 00:01:52.735
of political repression 
in American history.

00:01:52.735 --> 00:01:54.695
Spurred on by a network of bureaucrats,

00:01:54.695 --> 00:01:55.695
politicians,

00:01:55.695 --> 00:01:56.785
journalists,

00:01:56.785 --> 00:01:58.014
and businessmen,

00:01:58.014 --> 00:02:03.465
the campaign wildly exaggerated
the danger of communist subversion.

00:02:03.465 --> 00:02:05.225
The people behind it harassed anyone

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:08.074
suspected of holding 
left-of-center political views

00:02:08.074 --> 00:02:11.934
or associating with those who did.

00:02:11.934 --> 00:02:14.285
If you hung modern art on your walls,

00:02:14.285 --> 00:02:16.295
had a multiracial social circle,

00:02:16.295 --> 00:02:19.125
or signed petitions against
nuclear weapons,

00:02:19.125 --> 00:02:21.975
you might just have been a communist.

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:23.636
Starting in the late 1940s,

00:02:23.636 --> 00:02:26.175
FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover

00:02:26.175 --> 00:02:30.467
used the resources of his agency
to hunt down such supposed communists

00:02:30.467 --> 00:02:33.478
and eliminate them from any
position of influence

00:02:33.478 --> 00:02:36.389
within American society.

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.478
And the narrow criteria that Hoover
and his allies used

00:02:39.478 --> 00:02:41.478
to screen federal employees

00:02:41.478 --> 00:02:44.369
spread to the rest of the country.

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:45.809
Soon, Hollywood studios,

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:46.818
universities,

00:02:46.818 --> 00:02:48.179
car manufacturers,

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:51.228
and thousands of other public
and private employers

00:02:51.228 --> 00:02:57.159
were imposing the same political tests
on the men and women who worked for them.

00:02:57.171 --> 00:03:00.441
Meanwhile, Congress conducted 
its own witchhunt

00:03:00.441 --> 00:03:04.600
subpoenaing hundreds of people
to testify before investigative bodies

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.960
like the House Un-American 
Activities Committee.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.351
If they refused to cooperate,
they could be jailed for contempt,

00:03:12.351 --> 00:03:16.310
or more commonly, fired and blacklisted.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.680
Ambitious politicians, like Richard Nixon

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.431
and Joseph McCarthy,

00:03:20.431 --> 00:03:23.711
used such hearings as a partisan weapon

00:03:23.711 --> 00:03:26.501
accusing democrats 
of being soft on communism

00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:30.821
and deliberately losing China
to the Communist Bloc.

00:03:30.823 --> 00:03:33.832
McCarthy, a Republican senator 
from Wisconsin

00:03:33.832 --> 00:03:38.652
became notorious by flaunting
ever-changing lists of alleged communists

00:03:38.652 --> 00:03:41.283
within the State Department.

00:03:41.283 --> 00:03:43.094
Egged on by other politicians,

00:03:43.094 --> 00:03:45.803
he continued to make 
outrageous accusations

00:03:45.803 --> 00:03:49.403
while distorting or fabricating evidence.

00:03:49.403 --> 00:03:53.523
Many citizens reviled McCarthy
while others praised him.

00:03:53.523 --> 00:03:57.533
And when the Korean War broke out,
McCarthy seemed vindicated.

00:03:57.533 --> 00:03:59.873
Once he became chair

00:03:59.873 --> 00:04:04.344
of the Senate's permanent subcommittee
on investigations in 1953,

00:04:04.344 --> 00:04:06.613
McCarthy recklessness increased.

00:04:06.613 --> 00:04:12.704
It was his investigation of the army that 
finally turned public opinion against him

00:04:12.704 --> 00:04:15.334
and diminished his power.

00:04:15.334 --> 00:04:17.765
McCarthy's colleagues 
in the Senate censured him

00:04:17.765 --> 00:04:22.914
and he died less than three years later,
probably from alcoholism.

00:04:22.914 --> 00:04:24.895
McCarthyism ended as well.

00:04:24.895 --> 00:04:27.743
It had ruined hundreds, 
if not thousands, of lives

00:04:27.743 --> 00:04:32.134
and drastically narrowed the American
political spectrum.

00:04:32.134 --> 00:04:35.834
Its damage to democratic institutions
would be long lasting.

00:04:35.834 --> 00:04:39.165
In all likelihood, there were both
Democrats and Republicans

00:04:39.165 --> 00:04:43.545
who knew that the anti-communist
purges were deeply unjust

00:04:43.545 --> 00:04:48.415
but feared that directly opposing them
would hurt their careers.

00:04:48.415 --> 00:04:51.344
Even the Supreme Court failed
to stop the witchhunt,

00:04:51.344 --> 00:04:54.454
condoning serious violations
of constitutional rights

00:04:54.454 --> 00:04:57.334
in the name of national security.

00:04:57.334 --> 00:05:01.117
Was domestic communism an actual
threat to the American government?

00:05:01.117 --> 00:05:03.675
Perhaps, though a small one.

00:05:03.675 --> 00:05:08.000
But the reaction to it was so extreme
that it caused far more damage

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.350
than the threat itself.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.500
And if new demagogues appeared
in uncertain times

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.626
to attack unpopular minorities
in the name of patriotism,

00:05:17.626 --> 00:05:19.995
could it all happen again?
