00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:03.237
There's a new controversy with
White House press secretary

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.442
-and belligerent owl,
Sean Spicer. -(laughter)

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:13.447
-Boy... that is...
-(applause and cheering)

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:20.621
That... that forehead is taking
up a lot of face real estate!

00:00:20.654 --> 00:00:22.422
-(laughter)
-That is so much...

00:00:22.456 --> 00:00:24.358
Honestly, I think
he should just rent this out

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:27.027
as a double-decker tour bus,
like, right up there.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.495
Look at that. Come on.

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.964
-Look at how much.
-(applause and cheering)

00:00:30.998 --> 00:00:32.199
(laughing):
How much room.

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:35.602
-Look at how much room that is!
-Hop on, hop off.

00:00:35.636 --> 00:00:37.271
-HARDWICK: Hop on...
-(laughter)

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:40.140
Spicer's been open with the
public about his passwords,

00:00:40.174 --> 00:00:42.176
gum intake,
and opinion on Dippin' Dots,

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:45.579
which is not the ice cream
of the future, he said.

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:47.614
-(laughter and groaning)
-It's not.

00:00:47.648 --> 00:00:50.584
Basically, everything
except factual information.

00:00:50.617 --> 00:00:52.986
So now, he's giving
the American people more access

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.189
to his Venmo account.

00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:58.025
Twitter quickly found his public
Venmo profile, @seanspicer,

00:00:58.058 --> 00:00:59.726
and bombarded him
with payment requests

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.796
for things like "anxiety meds
because your boss is a lunatic."

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.668
-(laughter) -Or "meeting with
the gays to buy him new suits."

00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:09.036
(laughter)

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:11.572
But if anyone deserves
this minor inconvenience,

00:01:11.605 --> 00:01:13.740
it's the alternative
fact-spouting

00:01:13.774 --> 00:01:15.542
forehead known as Sean Spicer.

00:01:15.576 --> 00:01:17.744
Now, we would never,

00:01:17.778 --> 00:01:20.814
ever tell you, our audience,
to do such a thing,

00:01:20.848 --> 00:01:22.816
ever, so don't do this.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.552
But if you requested money
from Mr. Spicer,

00:01:25.586 --> 00:01:27.187
screen grab it
and send it to us.

00:01:27.221 --> 00:01:29.056
Maybe we would feature it
on the show.

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:30.490
Now I'm not saying do that!

00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:32.593
-In fact, I'm telling you
not to! -(laughter)

00:01:32.626 --> 00:01:36.964
-(applause and cheering)
-I am strongly...

00:01:36.997 --> 00:01:39.066
In...

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:41.768
In my deposition,
the record will show

00:01:41.802 --> 00:01:44.438
-I told you, do not do that!
-(laughter)

00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:47.207
So, comedians,
what would you ask Sean Spicer

00:01:47.241 --> 00:01:49.977
to pay for on Venmo? Katie.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.680
A plate, a knife and a fork for
how often he has to eat (bleep).

00:01:53.714 --> 00:01:55.349
-HARDWICK: All right, points.
-(laughter and groaning)

00:01:55.382 --> 00:01:57.150
-Very good.
-(applause and cheering)

00:01:57.184 --> 00:01:59.319
Very good. Josh.

00:01:59.353 --> 00:02:02.589
50 bucks so he can drill a hole
in the wall

00:02:02.623 --> 00:02:05.659
of a truck stop bathroom for
none of your (bleep) business.

00:02:05.692 --> 00:02:08.595
-(laughter, applause &amp; cheering)
-Points. Points.

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.597
-Seth.
-Gum-removal surgery.

00:02:10.631 --> 00:02:12.032
I'm worried about him.
He's gross.

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:12.132
-HARDWICK: Yeah, all right.
Points. Very good. -(laughter)
