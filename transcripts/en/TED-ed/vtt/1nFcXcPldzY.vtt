00:00:08.116 --> 00:00:09.581
In a typical hero's journey,

00:00:09.581 --> 00:00:11.880
the protagonist sets out on an adventure,

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.150
undergoes great change,

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.871
and returns in triumph 
to their point of origin.

00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:18.320
But in the Irish genre of myth
known as Eachtraí,

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.533
the journey to the other world
ends in a point of no return.

00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:26.252
While there are many different versions
of the otherworld in Irish mythology,

00:00:26.252 --> 00:00:29.941
the most well-known example occurs
in the story of Oisín.

00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:33.349
Oisín was the son of Fionn mac Cumhaill,
the leader of a group of pagan warriors

00:00:33.349 --> 00:00:35.351
known as the Fianna.

00:00:35.351 --> 00:00:37.349
As Oisín rode with his companions one day,

00:00:37.349 --> 00:00:40.807
he was visited by 
the immortal princess Niamh.

00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:42.711
The two fell instantly in love

00:00:42.711 --> 00:00:45.248
and Niamh put Oisín onto her white horse

00:00:45.248 --> 00:00:48.168
and rode with him 
to the edge of the Irish sea.

00:00:48.168 --> 00:00:51.949
As they made for the horizon,
the riders sunk into a golden haze.

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.828
They came to the shores of
the gleaming kingdom called Tír na nÓg.

00:00:55.828 --> 00:00:59.660
This was the home of the Tuatha Dé Danann,
the people who ruled Ancient Ireland

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.807
long before Oisín's time.

00:01:02.807 --> 00:01:05.792
From the point of his arrival,
Oisín's every need was met.

00:01:05.792 --> 00:01:09.610
He married Niamh in a grand ceremony
and was welcomed into her family.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.720
When he wished to hear music,
his ears filled with bewitching tones.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.909
When he hungered, golden plates
appeared laden with fragrant food.

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.560
He admired scenes of great beauty,
and colors that he had no name for.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.370
All around him, the land and the people
existed in a state of unmoving perfection.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.050
But what Oisín didn't know was that
Tír na nÓg was the land of youth,

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.802
in which time stood still
and the people never aged.

00:01:35.802 --> 00:01:39.990
In his new home, Oisín continued
to hunt and explore as he had in Ireland.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.429
But in the land of youth, he possessed
a strange, new invincibility.

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:46.209
At the end of each day of adventuring,

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:51.350
Oisín's wounds magically healed themselves
as he slept in Niamh's arms.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.601
Although glory and pleasure
came easily to Oisín in the land of youth,

00:01:55.601 --> 00:01:59.500
he missed the Fianna
and the adventures they had in Ireland.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.999
After three years in Tír na nÓg, he
was struck by a deep yearning for home.

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:06.661
Before he embarked on his journey back,
Niamh warned him

00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:11.304
that he must not alight from his horse
to touch the earth with his own feet.

00:02:11.304 --> 00:02:13.271
When Oisín reached the shores of Ireland,

00:02:13.271 --> 00:02:16.597
it felt as if a shadow 
had fallen over the world.

00:02:16.597 --> 00:02:21.861
On the hill where his father's palace lay,
he saw only a ruin strewn with weeds.

00:02:21.861 --> 00:02:25.481
His calls for his friends and family
echoed from derelict walls.

00:02:25.481 --> 00:02:30.253
Horrified, Oisín rode until he came upon
a group of peasants working in the fields.

00:02:30.253 --> 00:02:33.023
They were struggling to remove 
a boulder from their land,

00:02:33.023 --> 00:02:34.571
and forgetting Niamh's warning,

00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:39.256
Oisín leapt from his horse and rolled it
away with his superhuman strength.

00:02:39.256 --> 00:02:42.092
The crowd's cheers soon
turned into shrieks.

00:02:42.092 --> 00:02:45.682
In place of the youth was an old man
whose beard swept the ground

00:02:45.682 --> 00:02:47.853
and whose legs buckled under him.

00:02:47.853 --> 00:02:50.474
He cried out for Finn and the Fianna,

00:02:50.474 --> 00:02:55.803
but the people only recognized these names
from the distant past of 300 years before.

00:02:55.803 --> 00:02:57.761
Time had betrayed Oisín

00:02:57.761 --> 00:03:02.724
and his return to mortal lands
had aged him irreversibly.

00:03:02.724 --> 00:03:04.354
Throughout Irish folklore,

00:03:04.354 --> 00:03:08.443
sightings of the land of youth
have been reported in the depths of wells,

00:03:08.443 --> 00:03:10.602
on the brink of the horizon,

00:03:10.602 --> 00:03:13.012
or in the gloom of caves.

00:03:13.012 --> 00:03:16.905
But those who know the tale of Oisín
tell of another vision,

00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:22.604
that of a shining princess carried upon
the distant waves by a white horse,

00:03:22.604 --> 00:03:26.254
still hoping for the return 
of her doomed love.
