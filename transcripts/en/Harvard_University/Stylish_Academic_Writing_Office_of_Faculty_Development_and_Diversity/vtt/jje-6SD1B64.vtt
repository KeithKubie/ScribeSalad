JUDITH D. SINGER: Good
afternoon, everybody.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:07.520
I'm Judy Singer.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.645
I'm the Senior Vice Provost
for Faculty Development

00:00:09.645 --> 00:00:13.140
and Diversity and I want
to welcome all of you

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.420
on behalf of the
Office of the Provost

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.230
to this event on stylish
academic writing.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.720
I was describing to a
colleague over the weekend

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.740
this particular event.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.850
And he said, isn't
that an oxymoron?

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.090
And unfortunately, having
to read a lot of prose

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.460
across a lot of
disciplines, sometimes it

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.280
does sound like
it is an oxymoron.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.250
But I think today what
we're going to learn

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.010
is that it is possible to write
well, write clearly, and write

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.880
for your colleagues.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.421
I approach thinking
about this event

00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:47.920
from several different
perspectives.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.340
One is, I remember my first
year of graduate school,

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.130
turning in a paper
to my advisor.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.410
My PhD is in statistics.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.660
My advisor was Fred Mosteller.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.250
He was known as a
very good writer.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.730
And I turned in
my paper and I got

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.810
it back and there
was so much red ink

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.160
on it I was just traumatized.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.260
From the first sentence,
he just circles.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.020
My sentence began, there are.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.880
I thought that was a perfectly
fine way to begin a paper.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.610
Never begin a paper with
the words there are I

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.500
have never written a paper
or a paragraph with the words

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.500
there are since.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.200
In fact, I basically avoid it.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.730
And then over the
years, I see this

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.470
from in multiple perspectives
of thinking about the problem

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.740
space, one are the
arguments, sometimes heated,

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.820
that I get into
with my colleagues,

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.910
both about our own writing
and in collaborative work,

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.740
but also with our
graduate students,

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.440
arguments about the active
voice versus the passive voice.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.440
The number of papers I
read where it's not clear

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.510
that any human being was ever
involved in the research,

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.980
because it either comes from
God or is done by monkeys.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.550
But there is certainly
no human in the prose.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.570
Coming up with
students who say to me,

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.010
but my other reader said I had
to edit all these words out.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.984
And I'm, no, you have
to put them back in.

00:02:03.984 --> 00:02:05.400
So it's obviously
an area in which

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.750
we can hold different views
about what is considered

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.410
stylish academic writing.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.350
I also have a
particular perspective

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.770
of being involved in most of
the appointments processes

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.910
across the university,
and therefore

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.010
reading appointments
dossiers and tenure

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.800
dossiers across
the universities,

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.670
as well as papers from
a variety of fields.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.090
And what goes for stylish
writing in one field

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.040
is very different from what
happens in another field.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.490
I also make a parenthetical
note that my favorite dossiers

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.754
are written by Steve Pinker.

00:02:37.754 --> 00:02:39.420
You should be lucky
enough to have Steve

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.900
make your case for tenure.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.020
It's really quite a statement.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.670
The idea for this event came
when Helen Sword contacted me,

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.680
said she was going
to be in the States

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.930
and was interested in speaking
with a group of faculty

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.210
about this topic.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.220
And we have been
running a series

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.460
on publishing more
generally for the faculty

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.400
from a variety of perspectives.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.455
And the notion of thinking
about how to write well

00:03:05.455 --> 00:03:07.330
was something that was
quite appealing to us.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.520
But we had to figure out how to
time this with Helen's schedule

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.930
since she comes from the
other side of the planet.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.360
And then we wanted to have
two other perspectives

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.660
on the panel, one
of a faculty member

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.170
who thinks quite closely
about writing and every word

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.090
and how it's presented,
and Steve Pinker

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.570
was very gracious in accepting
our invitation, as well

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.250
as Elizabeth Knoll from
Harvard University Press, who

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.490
has done a lot of work with
us on these book publishing

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:34.290
events.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.740
And if you're interested
in learning about the book

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.890
publishing business,
I can think of no one

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.794
better than Elizabeth
Knoll to be your guide.

00:03:41.794 --> 00:03:43.210
So with those
opening remarks, I'm

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.670
going to turn this over
to Amy Brand, my colleague

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.420
in the Provost's office,
Assistant Provost

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.800
for Faculty Appointments
and Faculty Appointments,

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.520
who by the way, was an editor at
MIT Press in a former lifetime,

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.440
so really comes out of the book
publishing industry as well.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.001
And thank you very
much for coming.

00:03:59.001 --> 00:03:59.500
Bye, bye.

00:04:06.117 --> 00:04:07.700
AMY BRAND: Good
afternoon and welcome.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.130
We're delighted to see faculty
from across the university

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.390
at this event.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.690
And we're going to
start the panel out

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.060
with our invited
guest, Helen Sword.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.130
Helen is the author of the book
that you now have in your hands

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.300
I hope, the namesake
for the panel,

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.440
Stylish Academic Writing.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.820
Helen is originally from
Southern California.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.240
She received her PhD in
comparative literature

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.530
from Princeton and now teaches
at the University of Auckland

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.880
as Professor and
Director for the Center

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.230
of Learning and Research
in Higher Education.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.910
Helen is an outspoken
advocate for creativity

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.250
and craftsmanship in
scholarship and has

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.960
offered workshops on
popular academic writing

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:47.950
all over the world.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.330
In fact, we are just the second
stop on a 14 university tour

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.860
that she's in the
middle of right now.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.080
Helen will be followed by
Elizabeth, Executive Editor

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.700
at Large at Harvard
University Press.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.420
And as Judy
mentioned our offices

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.810
go to person on all matters
related to book publishing.

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.490
Elizabeth holds a PhD in
the history of science

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.270
and has been doing book
acquisitions since 1988.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.880
As the range of fields that
she acquires and continues

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.290
to expand, she in her
own words, consequently

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.330
knows less and less
about more and more.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.990
I take issue with
that, actually.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.370
Elizabeth knows
a lot about a lot

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.010
and will offer an editor's
perspective on Helen's remarks.

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.100
And batting clean up
we have Steve Pinker.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.250
Steve is Harvard College
Professor and Johnstone Family

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.850
Professor in the Department
of Psychology and author

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:42.770
of many blockbuster titles for
the general reader on language

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.490
evolution, the mind, and
most recently on violence,

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.130
with Better Angels
of Our Nature.

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.924
Steve has received so many
awards and recognitions

00:05:51.924 --> 00:05:53.340
that I won't attempt
to list them,

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.700
but most recently he was named
one of Prospect Magazine's

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:01.070
top 10 World Thinkers for 2013.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.620
So our plan for the
panelists comments to last,

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.790
hopefully no more than an
hour, leaving plenty of time

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.820
for your questions
and discussion.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.470
So Helen, start with you.
