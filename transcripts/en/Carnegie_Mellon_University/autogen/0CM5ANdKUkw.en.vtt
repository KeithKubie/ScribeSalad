one of my previous jobs computer science
 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.090
one of my previous jobs computer science
was a domain that reported to me in

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100
was a domain that reported to me in
 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.469
was a domain that reported to me in
another institution which which is a

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479
another institution which which is a
 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.219
another institution which which is a
competitor and one of the things I

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229
competitor and one of the things I
 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.609
competitor and one of the things I
realized since coming here is that this

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619
realized since coming here is that this
 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.039
realized since coming here is that this
school of computer science is even

richer even broader even deeper and even
 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.760
richer even broader even deeper and even
stronger than I ever knew from the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770
stronger than I ever knew from the
 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.480
stronger than I ever knew from the
outside so it's a it's a great pleasure

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490

you measure what a website is doing and

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:03.800
you measure what a website is doing and
 

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.130
you measure what a website is doing and
how useful how well it's doing it is how

00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:06.140
how useful how well it's doing it is how
 

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:07.450
how useful how well it's doing it is how
much time people spend on it and how

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:07.460
much time people spend on it and how
 

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:08.680
much time people spend on it and how
many hits you get and how much time

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:08.690
many hits you get and how much time
 

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:11.380

time it has all types of context and it

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:18.260
time it has all types of context and it
 

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.230
time it has all types of context and it
can be this sort of more

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:20.240
can be this sort of more
 

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:23.380

types of different ways so I see a lot

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:26.000
types of different ways so I see a lot
 

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.020

things worked into utility which is

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:34.970
things worked into utility which is
 

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:36.940
things worked into utility which is
which which is a very different mindset

which which is a very different mindset
 

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:40.360
which which is a very different mindset
and I think unlocks a whole series of

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:40.370
and I think unlocks a whole series of
 

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:43.000
and I think unlocks a whole series of
problems that are going to get

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:43.010
problems that are going to get
 

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:44.890
problems that are going to get
increasingly increasingly difficult one

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:44.900
increasingly increasingly difficult one
 

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:46.360

of the things we work on in New York is

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:46.370
of the things we work on in New York is
 

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:48.640
of the things we work on in New York is
is artificial intelligence and you know

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:48.650
is artificial intelligence and you know
 

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:50.650
is artificial intelligence and you know
it's not hard to imagine i'm sure

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:50.660
it's not hard to imagine i'm sure
 

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.870
it's not hard to imagine i'm sure
science fiction did this long before we

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:52.880
science fiction did this long before we
 

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.760

started working on it that you can talk

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:54.770
started working on it that you can talk
 

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:58.780
started working on it that you can talk
to your phone and not just ask it you

00:21:58.780 --> 00:21:58.790
to your phone and not just ask it you
 

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:00.340
to your phone and not just ask it you
know to transcribe some text but also

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:00.350
know to transcribe some text but also

ask a contextual rich questions about

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:02.990
ask a contextual rich questions about
 

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:05.020
ask a contextual rich questions about
the world around you and about you as a

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:05.030
the world around you and about you as a
 

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:07.450
the world around you and about you as a
person and all of these are things that

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:07.460
person and all of these are things that
 

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:09.549
person and all of these are things that
speak very directly to the experience of

00:22:09.549 --> 00:22:09.559
speak very directly to the experience of
 

00:22:09.559 --> 00:22:12.400
speak very directly to the experience of
having a mobile device and they're much

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:12.410
having a mobile device and they're much
 

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:13.930
having a mobile device and they're much
more difficult than building a website

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:13.940
more difficult than building a website
 

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:18.370
more difficult than building a website
and so I think we're about to see we're

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:18.380
and so I think we're about to see we're
 

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:20.919
and so I think we're about to see we're
already seeing an explosion in the

00:22:20.919 --> 00:22:20.929
already seeing an explosion in the
 

00:22:20.929 --> 00:22:24.310

is this is some this is this is what our

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:31.220
is this is some this is this is what our
 

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:34.960
is this is some this is this is what our
generation is going to have to do we

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:34.970
generation is going to have to do we
 

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:37.060
generation is going to have to do we
have to have a conversation i think is

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:37.070
have to have a conversation i think is
 

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:40.080
have to have a conversation i think is
the answer so much technology has

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:40.090
the answer so much technology has
 

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:42.970
the answer so much technology has
technology has created the potential for

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:42.980
technology has created the potential for
 

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:44.830
technology has created the potential for
so much you know people spin off so much

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:44.840
so much you know people spin off so much
 

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:47.020
so much you know people spin off so much
more data that can be captured and will

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:47.030
more data that can be captured and will
 

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:48.520
more data that can be captured and will
be captured in Denver tantly if you're

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:48.530
be captured in Denver tantly if you're
 

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:50.560
be captured in Denver tantly if you're
not careful these days than they used to

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:50.570
not careful these days than they used to
 

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:52.240
not careful these days than they used to
and there's so much potential for that

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:52.250
and there's so much potential for that
 

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:54.730
and there's so much potential for that
data and of course there's so much that

00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:54.740
data and of course there's so much that
 

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:56.350
data and of course there's so much that
we want to protect about that data and

00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:56.360
we want to protect about that data and
 

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.880
we want to protect about that data and
privacy is something that's important to

00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:57.890
privacy is something that's important to
 

00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:02.310
privacy is something that's important to
people and I think what that means is

00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:02.320
people and I think what that means is
 

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:05.050
people and I think what that means is
somebody and it can be legislators it

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:05.060
somebody and it can be legislators it
 

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:06.730
somebody and it can be legislators it
can be you know government it can be

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:06.740
can be you know government it can be
 

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:08.410
can be you know government it can be
private companies like Facebook and I

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:08.420
private companies like Facebook and I
 

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:09.840
private companies like Facebook and I
think this is something we're doing

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:09.850
think this is something we're doing
 

00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:12.160
think this is something we're doing
needs to sit down and say well what if

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:12.170
needs to sit down and say well what if
 

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:13.660
needs to sit down and say well what if
the rules work this way what if the

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:13.670
the rules work this way what if the
 

00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:15.130
the rules work this way what if the
things that are you know what if for

00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:15.140
things that are you know what if for
 

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:16.210
things that are you know what if for
instance this is something that we

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:16.220
instance this is something that we
 

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:18.370
instance this is something that we
talked about the things that are on your

00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:18.380
talked about the things that are on your
 

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:20.110
talked about the things that are on your
profile that's your space and so you

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:20.120
profile that's your space and so you
 

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.730
profile that's your space and so you
control them you can delete all those

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:21.740
control them you can delete all those
 

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:23.290
control them you can delete all those
things and you can do all these things

00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:23.300
things and you can do all these things
 

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:24.550
things and you can do all these things
but the things that are on other

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:24.560
but the things that are on other
 

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:25.810
but the things that are on other
people's profiles are their space

00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:25.820
people's profiles are their space

people's profiles are their space
there's a very simple organizing

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:27.830
there's a very simple organizing
 

00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:30.970
there's a very simple organizing
principle for data and and it's just you

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:30.980
principle for data and and it's just you
 

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:34.270
principle for data and and it's just you
know the scratch on the surface of what

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:34.280
know the scratch on the surface of what
 

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:40.480
know the scratch on the surface of what
needs to be but I think we are going to

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:40.490
needs to be but I think we are going to
 

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:43.490
needs to be but I think we are going to
chip away at figuring out what these

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:43.500
chip away at figuring out what these
 

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:45.200
chip away at figuring out what these
rules look like and eventually they'll

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:45.210
rules look like and eventually they'll
 

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:49.630
rules look like and eventually they'll
be as intuitive to us as you know

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:49.640
be as intuitive to us as you know
 

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:52.550
be as intuitive to us as you know

areas that technology is enabled but
 

00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:57.710

right now we haven't had that

00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:57.720
right now we haven't had that
 

00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.990
right now we haven't had that
conversation and so it's very hard for

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.000
conversation and so it's very hard for
 

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.540
conversation and so it's very hard for
people to understand what's happening

sophisticated dialogue about this and
 

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:13.190

we want to have access to to it but
hopefully we can make those those rules

can the schools do to make people even
better at that yeah so I'm tempted to

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:53.930
better at that yeah so I'm tempted to
 

00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:55.329
better at that yeah so I'm tempted to
say they don't know anything about any

00:35:55.329 --> 00:35:55.339
say they don't know anything about any
 

00:35:55.339 --> 00:35:57.670

of those things which is generally which

00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:57.680
of those things which is generally which
 

00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.410
of those things which is generally which
is sort of the short answer I think it's

00:35:59.410 --> 00:35:59.420
is sort of the short answer I think it's
 

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:00.520
is sort of the short answer I think it's
actually getting better i think the

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:00.530
actually getting better i think the
 

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:02.800
actually getting better i think the
percentage of students that have like a

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:02.810

feedback so i think it's getting better

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:14.800
feedback so i think it's getting better
 

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:18.640

there's this sort of emerging place for

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:36.980
there's this sort of emerging place for
 

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:39.950
there's this sort of emerging place for
technology that isn't just something you

00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:39.960
technology that isn't just something you
 

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:41.630
technology that isn't just something you
have to pull out and sort of look at

00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:41.640
have to pull out and sort of look at
 

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:44.450
have to pull out and sort of look at
like I think they're all types of

00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:44.460
like I think they're all types of
 

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:45.920
like I think they're all types of
different interactions or different ways

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:45.930
different interactions or different ways
 

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:47.030
different interactions or different ways
you may want to be notified about

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040
you may want to be notified about
 

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:48.650
you may want to be notified about
different things and of course there's

00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:48.660
different things and of course there's
 

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:50.660
different things and of course there's
you know this Apple watch I think a lot

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:50.670
you know this Apple watch I think a lot
 

00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:52.160
you know this Apple watch I think a lot
of our industry is now kind of in pause

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:52.170
of our industry is now kind of in pause
 

00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:54.320
of our industry is now kind of in pause
mode waiting to see what happens with

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:54.330
mode waiting to see what happens with
 

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:56.750
mode waiting to see what happens with
you know is Apple creating a segment are

00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:56.760
you know is Apple creating a segment are
 

00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:59.780
you know is Apple creating a segment are
they inventing 50 new idioms that we

00:38:59.780 --> 00:38:59.790
they inventing 50 new idioms that we
 

00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:01.790
they inventing 50 new idioms that we
know I have to to copy and market in our

00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:01.800
know I have to to copy and market in our
 

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:04.700
know I have to to copy and market in our
own software but I think the one thing

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:04.710
own software but I think the one thing
 

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:08.690
own software but I think the one thing
that I'm seeing is that hardware is

00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:08.700
that I'm seeing is that hardware is
 

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:12.500
that I'm seeing is that hardware is
really compelling I get asked about

00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:12.510
really compelling I get asked about
 

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:14.780
really compelling I get asked about
thirty percent of the time whereas it

00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:14.790
thirty percent of the time whereas it
 

00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:16.370
thirty percent of the time whereas it
used to be zero percent of the time hey

00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:16.380
used to be zero percent of the time hey
 

00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:17.630
used to be zero percent of the time hey
do you know an electrical engineer

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:17.640
do you know an electrical engineer
 

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:19.190
do you know an electrical engineer
whereas it used to be one hundred

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200
whereas it used to be one hundred
 

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:20.600
whereas it used to be one hundred
percent of the times you know a software

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:20.610
percent of the times you know a software
 

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:22.640
percent of the times you know a software
engineer and now you know when people

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:22.650
engineer and now you know when people
 

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:24.680
engineer and now you know when people
ask me for a software engineer more than

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:24.690
ask me for a software engineer more than
 

00:39:24.690 --> 00:39:26.870
ask me for a software engineer more than
fifty percent of the time they mean in

00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880
fifty percent of the time they mean in
 

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:30.140
fifty percent of the time they mean in
iOS or Android developer so those trends

00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:30.150
iOS or Android developer so those trends
 

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:32.240
iOS or Android developer so those trends
are those trends are pretty clear and I

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:32.250
are those trends are pretty clear and I
 

00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:34.790
are those trends are pretty clear and I
think we're about to see another one of

00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800
think we're about to see another one of
 

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.680
think we're about to see another one of
those big shifts and hardware and

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:36.690
those big shifts and hardware and
 

00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:40.670
those big shifts and hardware and
variables yeah that makes sense hi my

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:40.680
variables yeah that makes sense hi my
 

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.440
variables yeah that makes sense hi my
name is Ben Lichtman I'm a sophomore in

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:42.450
name is Ben Lichtman I'm a sophomore in
 

00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:45.440
name is Ben Lichtman I'm a sophomore in
computer science here so you started to

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:45.450
computer science here so you started to
 

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:47.030
computer science here so you started to
address my point but I would sort of

00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.040
address my point but I would sort of
 

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:50.990
address my point but I would sort of
want to focus on it I'm sort of going

00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:51.000
want to focus on it I'm sort of going
 

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.060
want to focus on it I'm sort of going
through my first internships and what

00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:53.070
through my first internships and what
 

00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:55.760
through my first internships and what
I'm seeing is a lot of the course work I

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:55.770
I'm seeing is a lot of the course work I
 

00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:58.370
I'm seeing is a lot of the course work I
do here is very theory oriented maybe

00:39:58.370 --> 00:39:58.380
do here is very theory oriented maybe
 

00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:00.780
do here is very theory oriented maybe
there's programming involved but it's

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:00.790
there's programming involved but it's
 

00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:04.440
there's programming involved but it's
concepts its ideas and you mentioned 251

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:04.450
concepts its ideas and you mentioned 251
 

00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:07.590
concepts its ideas and you mentioned 251
very idea based then I get to my

00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:07.600
very idea based then I get to my
 

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:09.540
very idea based then I get to my
internship and as others have mentioned

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:09.550
internship and as others have mentioned
 

00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:11.460
internship and as others have mentioned
you know they say do you know get you

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:11.470
you know they say do you know get you
 

00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:13.280
you know they say do you know get you
know agile do you know these things um

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:13.290
know agile do you know these things um
 

00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:15.710
know agile do you know these things um
but more than that do you have a a

00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:15.720
but more than that do you have a a
 

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:18.540
but more than that do you have a a
working knowledge of software

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:18.550
working knowledge of software
 

00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:21.810
working knowledge of software
engineering and so do you have

00:40:21.810 --> 00:40:21.820
engineering and so do you have
 

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:23.820
engineering and so do you have
recommendations on how to go through

00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:23.830
recommendations on how to go through
 

00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:26.340
recommendations on how to go through
that growth process of equating both the

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:26.350
that growth process of equating both the
 

00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:29.010
that growth process of equating both the
theoretical aspects of computer science

00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:29.020
theoretical aspects of computer science
 

00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:32.250
theoretical aspects of computer science
and the real applicable practical

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:32.260
and the real applicable practical
 

00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:36.300
and the real applicable practical
aspects yeah i mean this is this is you

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:36.310
aspects yeah i mean this is this is you
 

00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:38.160
aspects yeah i mean this is this is you
know we joke about like having having

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:38.170
know we joke about like having having
 

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:40.440
know we joke about like having having
people fiddle with with github and

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:40.450
people fiddle with with github and
 

00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:43.470
people fiddle with with github and
things and I think there's it really

00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:43.480
things and I think there's it really
 

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:45.030
things and I think there's it really
belies this point about building

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:45.040
belies this point about building
 

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:47.550
belies this point about building
software in groups it's very hard to run

00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:47.560
software in groups it's very hard to run
 

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:49.200
software in groups it's very hard to run
a class where you build software in

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:49.210
a class where you build software in
 

00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:51.030
a class where you build software in
groups but that's really all that

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:51.040
groups but that's really all that
 

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:55.580
groups but that's really all that
happens outside of school I think like

00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:55.590
happens outside of school I think like
 

00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:57.870
happens outside of school I think like
this is a really difficult one this is

00:40:57.870 --> 00:40:57.880
this is a really difficult one this is
 

00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:59.610
this is a really difficult one this is
also like you know we we have these

00:40:59.610 --> 00:40:59.620
also like you know we we have these
 

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:01.440
also like you know we we have these
interviews where we get at how somebody

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:01.450
interviews where we get at how somebody
 

00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:04.140
interviews where we get at how somebody
understands how processes will scale to

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:04.150
understands how processes will scale to
 

00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:05.670
understands how processes will scale to
millions or billions of things another

00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:05.680
millions or billions of things another
 

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:07.440
millions or billions of things another
thing that you really really can't give

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:07.450
thing that you really really can't give
 

00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:09.630
thing that you really really can't give
people great experience with here

00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:09.640
people great experience with here
 

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:11.610
people great experience with here
without you know millions of people

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:11.620
without you know millions of people
 

00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:13.110
without you know millions of people
hammering your website every minute

00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:13.120
hammering your website every minute
 

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:15.120
hammering your website every minute
that's not an experience that you get at

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:15.130
that's not an experience that you get at
 

00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:17.490
that's not an experience that you get at
Carnegie Mellon internships are awesome

00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:17.500
Carnegie Mellon internships are awesome
 

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:19.230
Carnegie Mellon internships are awesome
you're in your sophomore year you you

00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:19.240
you're in your sophomore year you you
 

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:20.490
you're in your sophomore year you you
get to do three of these you get to

00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:20.500
get to do three of these you get to
 

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:21.960
get to do three of these you get to
sample different companies you'll

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:21.970
sample different companies you'll
 

00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:23.550
sample different companies you'll
probably work in different code bases

00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:23.560
probably work in different code bases
 

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:25.680
probably work in different code bases
you'll kind of see how this works I

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:25.690
you'll kind of see how this works I
 

00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:27.810
you'll kind of see how this works I
would love for more group based

00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:27.820
would love for more group based
 

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:30.210
would love for more group based
collaborative projects that kind of get

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:30.220
collaborative projects that kind of get
 

00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:32.580
collaborative projects that kind of get
you into this the one piece of advice I

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:32.590
you into this the one piece of advice I
 

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:34.770
you into this the one piece of advice I
would say besides like yeah this is the

00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:34.780
would say besides like yeah this is the
 

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:36.000
would say besides like yeah this is the
thing you're going to learn in industry

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:36.010
thing you're going to learn in industry
 

00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:39.450
thing you're going to learn in industry
is dig up some of your old code go try

00:41:39.450 --> 00:41:39.460
is dig up some of your old code go try
 

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:42.150
is dig up some of your old code go try
to read it you know be sort of that

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:42.160
to read it you know be sort of that
 

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:44.370
to read it you know be sort of that
meticulous person about some things like

00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:44.380
meticulous person about some things like
 

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:47.400
meticulous person about some things like
naming your variables or just you know

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:47.410
naming your variables or just you know
 

00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:49.170
naming your variables or just you know
think of your code as something that

00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:49.180
think of your code as something that
 

00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:51.990
think of your code as something that
you're like printing out and then

00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:52.000
you're like printing out and then
 

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.310
you're like printing out and then
mailing to somebody else and they have

00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:53.320
mailing to somebody else and they have
 

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:55.470
mailing to somebody else and they have
to pick up and read because the

00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:55.480
to pick up and read because the
 

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:57.600
to pick up and read because the
empirical truth that we see is that

00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:57.610
empirical truth that we see is that
 

00:41:57.610 --> 00:41:59.190
empirical truth that we see is that
you'll spend three times as much time

00:41:59.190 --> 00:41:59.200
you'll spend three times as much time
 

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:01.290
you'll spend three times as much time
reading somebody else's code as you will

00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:01.300
reading somebody else's code as you will
 

00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:03.870
reading somebody else's code as you will
writing your own code and you just have

00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:03.880
writing your own code and you just have
 

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:06.540
writing your own code and you just have
to get into the habit of that and it

00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:06.550
to get into the habit of that and it
 

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:08.010
to get into the habit of that and it
will say in a place like Facebook people

00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:08.020
will say in a place like Facebook people
 

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:10.260
will say in a place like Facebook people
are very concerned the thing that

00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:10.270
are very concerned the thing that
 

00:42:10.270 --> 00:42:11.850
are very concerned the thing that
motivates people day after day is

00:42:11.850 --> 00:42:11.860
motivates people day after day is
 

00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:13.500

getting up and pressing their peers

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:13.510
getting up and pressing their peers
 

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:14.820
getting up and pressing their peers
that's true here in this problem

00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:14.830
that's true here in this problem
 

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:17.010
that's true here in this problem
true anywhere you go where people are

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:17.020
true anywhere you go where people are
 

00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:19.440
true anywhere you go where people are
really great and one way you do that is

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:19.450
really great and one way you do that is
 

00:42:19.450 --> 00:42:20.880
really great and one way you do that is
you write some code that somebody's just

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:20.890
you write some code that somebody's just
 

00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:22.980

like that was a pleasure to work in I

00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:22.990
like that was a pleasure to work in I
 

00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:25.260
like that was a pleasure to work in I
know exactly how that works I want to

00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:25.270
know exactly how that works I want to
 

00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:27.750
know exactly how that works I want to
take that that design pattern and use it

00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:27.760
take that that design pattern and use it
 

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.670
take that that design pattern and use it
over here why don't we generalize this

00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:29.680
over here why don't we generalize this
 

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.200
over here why don't we generalize this
so now it's a platform if you're the guy

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:31.210
so now it's a platform if you're the guy
 

00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:32.700
so now it's a platform if you're the guy

months yeah so I did this like

00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:03.640
months yeah so I did this like
 

00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:05.310
months yeah so I did this like
intermediate thing where I went into

00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:05.320
intermediate thing where I went into

know how to do that and then go off and
join the team and I think that's really

00:44:02.970 --> 00:44:02.980
join the team and I think that's really
 

00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:05.010
join the team and I think that's really
helpful and hopefully other companies do

right now I think you look at our for

00:45:08.850 --> 00:45:08.860
right now I think you look at our for
 

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:11.280
right now I think you look at our for
instance we have a big product where

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:11.290
instance we have a big product where
 

00:45:11.290 --> 00:45:12.900
instance we have a big product where
people check into places and sometimes

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:12.910
people check into places and sometimes
 

00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:14.940
people check into places and sometimes
they don't see because their GPS

00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:14.950
they don't see because their GPS
 

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:16.350
they don't see because their GPS
coordinates are not that accurate they

00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:16.360
coordinates are not that accurate they
 

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:17.460
coordinates are not that accurate they
don't see the place they want to check

00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:17.470
don't see the place they want to check
 

00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:19.800
don't see the place they want to check
into and so they go and create it and so

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:19.810
into and so they go and create it and so
 

00:45:19.810 --> 00:45:20.880
into and so they go and create it and so
we have this constant problem of

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:20.890
we have this constant problem of
 

00:45:20.890 --> 00:45:22.320
we have this constant problem of
duplicate places we have all types of

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:22.330
duplicate places we have all types of
 

00:45:22.330 --> 00:45:24.840
duplicate places we have all types of
product reasons but we also discover

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:24.850
product reasons but we also discover
 

00:45:24.850 --> 00:45:27.150
