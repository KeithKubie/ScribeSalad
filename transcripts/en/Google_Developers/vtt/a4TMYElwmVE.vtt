00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.400
SPEAKER 1: So this is the
first GDD I'm attending.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.775
SPEAKER 2: I'm
coming from Egypt.

00:00:03.775 --> 00:00:05.280
We spent 24 hours to be here.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.070
SPEAKER 3: I knew many of
my friends will be here.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.336
SPEAKER 4: The fact that I
got to know so many people.

00:00:13.336 --> 00:00:14.460
SPEAKER 5: So many mentors.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.690
SPEAKER 6: Networked
with so many people.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.460
SPEAKER 7: Coming to the
event, I actually get, like,

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.529
meet them face to face.

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.070
You know, have that
personal connect.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.780
SPEAKER 8: That's something that
makes this thing really worth

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:23.280
it.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.180
SPEAKER 9: There's
always something

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.330
that you can incorporate.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.750
If not as a developer,
but as a designer,

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.590
you can still learn how
to build communities

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.559
of a certain interest.

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:32.100
SPEAKER 10: Everybody
is like-minded.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.055
Everybody wants to
achieve something.

00:00:34.055 --> 00:00:35.680
SPEAKER 5: This is
a great opportunity.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.745
This place is very cool.

00:00:37.745 --> 00:00:39.360
SPEAKER 11: I attended
a few sessions

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.780
from people who are,
like, legends in Google.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.910
SPEAKER 12: We learned
so many things from them,

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.760
like how to work
in the community,

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.534
how to develop in our field.

00:00:49.534 --> 00:00:51.950
SPEAKER 13: I was looking into
some certification programs

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:52.660
by Google.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.270
So I'll be going into that.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.960
SPEAKER 14: Love the
demo booths here.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.376
SPEAKER 5: I know
web development.

00:00:57.376 --> 00:01:00.030
But I haven't explored other
domains, like machine learning,

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.501
TensorFlow, and everything.

00:01:01.501 --> 00:01:03.000
And here, I get to
attend everything

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.695
related to all the domains.

00:01:04.695 --> 00:01:06.570
SPEAKER 15: I'm final
year student at College

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.653
of Engineering, Changodar.

00:01:07.653 --> 00:01:11.250
I want to teach what I gain
from here to my teammates,

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.970
and thus improve my project.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.840
SPEAKER 16: I also spent
a few hours with Googlers,

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.150
like Ashish and Suchit.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.340
And they all are
really amazing guys.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.030
I love them all.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.230
SPEAKER 17: Something
that I really

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.880
like about this
event is the gender

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.270
ratio is pretty high for women.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.728
I see a lot of
women participation,

00:01:26.728 --> 00:01:28.350
and that makes me really happy.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.810
SPEAKER 18: I'm proud to say
I am a woman entrepreneur.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.864
SPEAKER 6: And making
sure that others are also

00:01:32.864 --> 00:01:35.030
encouraged to be a part of
this, that's a huge deal.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.404
SPEAKER 19: Even
the speakers, we

00:01:36.404 --> 00:01:38.670
are getting the female
expertise in technology.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.970
It gives me so much happiness to
be a part of women tech-makers.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.440
SPEAKER 1: A
developer in India is

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.560
someone who is really keen on
developing something good that

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.760
will be used by millions
of people around the world.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.550
SPEAKER 13: My contribution as
a developer would be finding

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.190
new drug for cancer patients.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.565
SPEAKER 20: Becoming
an engineer,

00:01:57.565 --> 00:01:59.259
I can add a lot of
value to many lives.

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:00.300
SPEAKER 3: It's exciting.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.060
If you get to do what you want,
it's all just exciting and fun.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.510
SPEAKER 6: Go GDD India!

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.750
ALL: See you next year.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.830
Bye bye.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.280
