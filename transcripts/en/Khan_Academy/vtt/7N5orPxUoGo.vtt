- [Instructor] What is
the area of the triangle?

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:04.974
And they're talking
about this triangle here.

00:00:04.974 --> 00:00:07.021
And like always, pause this video

00:00:07.021 --> 00:00:10.211
and see if you can figure
it out on your own.

00:00:10.211 --> 00:00:12.579
Alright, now let's work
through it together.

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:15.746
So we know that the area of a triangle

00:00:16.625 --> 00:00:18.964
is going to be equal to one half

00:00:18.964 --> 00:00:21.714
times our base, times our height.

00:00:24.964 --> 00:00:26.661
Let me do the height in a different color.

00:00:26.661 --> 00:00:28.078
Times our height.

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:34.030
So what is the length of
our base in this scenario?

00:00:35.322 --> 00:00:38.524
Well the base is this 18 right over here.

00:00:38.524 --> 00:00:40.015
Let me highlight it.

00:00:40.015 --> 00:00:43.348
This length right over here is our base.

00:00:44.498 --> 00:00:47.998
So the base is 18, and what is the height?

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:51.589
Well the height we see is six.

00:00:53.457 --> 00:00:54.646
They give it to us.

00:00:54.646 --> 00:00:55.895
They don't always give it to you,

00:00:55.895 --> 00:00:58.072
but in this example they do.

00:00:58.072 --> 00:01:00.489
So the height is, the height,

00:01:02.012 --> 00:01:05.172
the height is, I'm having
trouble with my pen,

00:01:05.172 --> 00:01:07.442
is six, so now we just have to compute

00:01:07.442 --> 00:01:10.936
what one half times 18 times six is.

00:01:10.936 --> 00:01:12.848
Well let's think about this a little bit.

00:01:12.848 --> 00:01:15.015
One half times 18 is nine.

00:01:16.385 --> 00:01:19.052
Nine times six is equal to what?

00:01:20.632 --> 00:01:23.132
Nine times six is equal to 54.

00:01:25.577 --> 00:01:26.410
And we're done.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.410
This is 54 square units.
