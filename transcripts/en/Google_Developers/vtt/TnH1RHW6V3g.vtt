&gt;&gt; Rishi Chandra: Again, so all of a sudden
now we can create enhanced experiences around

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.879
Android applications as well. And what's compelling
here is not only can users now have consistent

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:18.250
application across multiple devices but you
as a developer can now have additional devices

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.730
take your application.
And now we can also enable you to create entirely

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.570
new experiences directly on Google TV. Something
optimized specifically for the living room.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:36.469
And we are giving you two application frameworks,
Web apps and Android apps.

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:41.820
Now, we have some work to do. So the Android
Market and the Google TV specific SDK will

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.949
be coming shortly after product availability,
but to give you a sense of where the platform

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:52.350
is going, we want to give you a few developer
demos. And to do that I would like to introduce

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:00.239
Ambarish Kenghe, lead developer PM for Google
TV.

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:11.500
&gt;&gt;Ambarish Kenghe: Thanks, Rishi. Today I
would like to talk about how you as developers

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.050
can get involved with the Google TV platform
and showcase a few example applications and

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.570
Web sites.
First of all, you can optimize for the TV

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.530
screen. Most Web sites, as you would expect,
in many applications would run on Google TV

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.970
as they are. Today, we would also publish
very simple guidelines on how to quickly enhance

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:40.890
your Web site for a great TV experience.
But optimizing Web sites is just the beginning.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.670
We want to empower the developer community
to create integrated experiences across Web

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.340
and TV content and to enable that, we will
provide you with a set of Web and Android

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.850
APIs which will allow you to navigate TV content.
For example, you can directly search to a

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.940
TV channel that you like, or you can record
a TV show, all directly from your Web sites

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:05.760
and applications.
