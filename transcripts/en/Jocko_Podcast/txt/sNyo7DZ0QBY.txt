Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number one 80 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening. It was May, 1968 we were triple volunteers. We'd volunteered and graduated from the army's parachute jump school at Fort Benning, Georgia. Made it through the qualification course at the Special Forces Training Group in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and after attending the Fifth Special Forces Group airborne in country training program, we had volunteered to serve in Mac v sogs command and control during special forces training at Fort Bragg. Several of the Green Berets teaching various courses told us to avoid C and c because the duty was rough and the special forces casualties were high in the top secret unit. Despite all those warnings, Rick Howard, John McEntire, Rick Estas, Tony Horrell, Mark Gentry, Bob Garcia, Bobby d leathers, myself and a few others volunteered to serve in CNC. I had been in training or in between training cycles since entering the army on one December, 1966 in May, 1968 we were finally shifting gears from being in a training mode to an operational mode. None of the rumors prepared us for what followed. You won't need those. The sergeant major said, put away all pens, pencils and notebooks. This is a top secret briefing. All of you have either obtained a top secret clearance or will do so in the near future or you wouldn't be here. Welcome to the command and control detachment of the Fifth Special Forces Group, Airborne First Special Forces, United States Army Special Operations Augmentation study and observations group or simply c and C

Speaker 2:          00:01:59       [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:02:00       Gentlemen before you is a confidentiality agreement. You can't tell your girlfriend, your mother no one. We were prohibited from writing anything about the operation, forbidden from keeping diaries, taking photos, making drawings or tape recordings, notes of any sort. The sergeant major advised us that anyone who didn't want to sign that agreement could leave.

Speaker 1:          00:02:26       Gentlemen, the sergeant major turned toward a generic map on the wall. The North Vietnamese army controls these neutral countries and pointed to Cambodia and Laos located to the west of the Republican's, south Vietnam and of course north Vietnam. For several years. The North Vietnamese army had moved soldiers, supplies, rockets, guns and propagandists south into the eastern provinces of neutral Laos and Cambodia through an ever increasing network of trails and roads called the Ho Chi Minh trail complex. Now listen up real close. The sergeant major said, when you go across the fence, you will carry no identification of any manner, shape, or form. That meant no identification papers, no dog tags, no diaries, no photos, no love letters, and certainly no green berets. Everyone would wear sterile fatigues with no company in Signia, no name tags, no unit designators, no jump wings or combat infantry men badges. Why without giving anyone a chance to respond. He said that because Laos and Cambodia were neutral, the United States government could publicly proclaim that the u s reppers respected that neutrality. Thus, if we were killed in Laos or Cambodia or North Vietnam, the u s government would deny having anything to do with us.

Speaker 1:          00:03:53       United States government would explain that no Americans were stationed in Laos or Cambodia, which was technically accurate. U S government had a plausible deniability if we were killed or captured and if captured, we were to speak a foreign language. Don't tell them who you are. He ordered, remember technically under the terms and conditions of the Geneva Accords, your status is different than air force and Navy pilots shot down over north Vietnam. They're in uniform, they're identifiable as a u s servicemen. CNC Men don't fall into the category of prisoners of war. We were in effect spies, although the sergeant major never used that word. He also didn't tell us that spies had no protection under the Geneva Convention and that we could, some are laterally be executed if captured and that right there, that's some excerpts from the beginning of a book called across the fence, which is written by a special forces soldier in Vietnam named John Stryker Meyer and in this particular case it is an absolute honor for me to say that we have him here with us tonight to teach us about his experiences as a member of Mac resource studies and ops re observations, command group command and control teams. Sir,

Speaker 3:          00:05:35       welcome, welcome to the show. Glad to be here. That's quite a welcome. You got there Vietnam, Huh? Yes. It was quite something. Absolutely. Then at the time, we just watched the John Wayne movie, the Green Berets on top of it all. So, uh, we were all psyched. We've seen the movie. We're ready. That's all it takes. And had been four worn. You know when you go there, this is going to happen. The little guy's going to come out and ask for people to volunteer. So we said yeah, right now when we were done, it happened before he shipped us out. A little guy calls out. We're looking for volunteers and then a Johnny Mack goes for what? Sarge can't tell you either you're in or you're not. So we raised her hands the next day we were up in Denang for that briefing. You covered.

Speaker 4:          00:06:16       Dang. How well before we get jumped into that. Yeah. How'd you, how'd you end up in the military? Where did you grow up? You grew up in Jersey? Yeah. Grew up in Trenton, New Jersey. Uh, dad was a Milkman. We opened the milk truck and the mom was the a piano teacher. Choir organist

Speaker 3:          00:06:31       and, um, um, after high school took me two years to flunk out of college upon flunking out in 1966 I was working up at Yosemite National Park. Yeah. It was a garbage man farm man up there. And, um, the book, the Green Brace came out and my dad had sent me a letter saying, hey, that's it. You finally flunked out. You're going to get drafted. We got the notification here from the draft board. So I read the book and I said, you know what, if I'm going to go, if I can get in with these guys, that'd be a great challenge. And then if I can do that, that's the way I want to go. Because at that time with the army, uh, eight weeks of basic training, eight weeks of advanced infantry, a month leaving, you're in Vietnam, you can be with any regular conventional unit. And by that time there had been enough stories about some issues, um, particularly when the, you were engaged in a regular north Vietnamese army that Deere have some major issues and surprises of how strong the enemy was. So, um, give me some more training. I needed it.

Speaker 4:          00:07:31       And W when you were a kid were you, did you play sports or anything like that?

Speaker 3:          00:07:35       Yeah, um, I was never that good at it, but I love baseball was the head game and football. And my dad wouldn't let me play a football to my senior year of high school, so I had one year of football. But everything else was just like JV little league, just loved baseball.

Speaker 4:          00:07:52       Where did he want you to play football doing once you get hit in the head too much? That could be, they didn't care back then. Did they?

Speaker 3:          00:07:58       Well, you know what, I think it was more, well, in eighth grade I hurt my knee playing soccer. I said they were worried about followup injuries here and still have your body and Pete one piece when you go to college or wherever you're going to go, you know, so, um, they're very conservative mean. No, my mom, uh, she's a little farm girl from Central Jersey and she wouldn't, she was really unhappy with my granddad gave me a cap pistol. So that's the household we grew up in. But uh, you know, eventually we went out, learned about weapons a little bit along the way. And then of course when this came along and we got the real deal

Speaker 4:          00:08:34       and the, the F was so 1966. So public opinion wasn't completely against the war yet. Wasn't in 66. No, but it was beginning. You're starting, it was starting you, you had people doing the protest and letters to the editor

Speaker 3:          00:08:48       and uh, some of the fringe elms of society, like we see today. There's some of those parallels,

Speaker 4:          00:08:55       but [inaudible] you going down, how did your parents, your dad was onboard obviously cause he sent you the letter saying, all right buddy, you failed. What school did you flunk out of? Yeah, try and stay college. Yeah. And then, yeah, you just said, I'm going to go to Yosemite to be a firefighter. Well, we had a couple of buddies of mine that I'd been in college with, helped me flunk out and we did much, much serious drinking. Just the, you know, just stupid young, young and dumb and no idea what you're talking about. Yeah. And uh, so, uh, they had a crop congressmen that got us jobs and know [inaudible] it's a good old Frank Thompson came through for us. He drove across

Speaker 3:          00:09:37       and uh, in fact, uh, in Manhattan, Kansas, we got hit with tornado June 12th going across the rocky mountains. We had snow with the back window blown out a car. So it was just fun. Yeah. In a nice experience. Again, be drank a little bit too much there, but first time, real job, real money. And then the, the reality check is just like, these guys are amazing. If, I mean, if I can get even close to this, get the jump school, at least get a, tasted this. So that was the plan.

Speaker 4:          00:10:04       How was the, uh, how was the culture shock when you rolled into two, uh, army bootcamp?

Speaker 3:          00:10:09       Well, by that time I seen a couple dozen of the movies over time from the World War II movies. He kind of knew what was coming. So, um, early on I had a, uh, a friend of mine, uh, whose dad had been in the army. He goes, look, you'd go in, just remember this is like a game. They want to see if they can break you or not and you just gotta have the right mindset. And that stuck with me. So through basic particularly jump school, they come in and shake out of bed two o'clock in the morning for bogus inspections just to see if they could mess you up or brachy a little bit. It's kind of like, okay, we all noticed as a game, we're all know we're training here. And uh, so that was the way we move forward.

Speaker 4:          00:10:49       And you guys could go right into the, you got, you could go right into the Q course. Like you could just do that pipeline. It was open for you. Well,

Speaker 3:          00:10:55       because we lost so many people, they came out with what at that time we called the baby SF course. So yes. And even to this day, some of the guards that went to training group with are still down at Brag now training SF guys. And I mean, we're biased, but we feel that if you come through basic advanced jump school and go right into the Q course and qualify go, now I have a prequalification, then your qualification and then you get to Bray, um, that there's no bad habits. Like a lot of the sergeants from the old days when he came in and you, you had to be an [inaudible] above more, more timing grade, et Cetera, et cetera. And before they be even consider you. But, um, they need a bodies. Well, the guys, again, we're biased. So then we get the bias out front as the green kids that came in that went off and did the job and eventually it saga, um,

Speaker 5:          00:11:54       by 68, 69, the majority of the ones, euros team leaders were young guys. And there's a lot of us that either got bored, like in my case, flunked out for, just wanted some different, something different and said, this is special forces. And then you get the rumors and then you finally get to that briefing where you say, Hey, has a chance to volunteer. They'll do you realize there's the highest casualty operation, entire war, but they forgot to tell you. They didn't tell you that part. So did you, did you volunteer for CNC while you were still stateside or was that once you got overseas? No, at that time, the only way you get into special forces of that program was to enlist for airborne on assigned. And then when you went through basic Dennett advanced infantry, you, uh, you would be, uh, offered the opportunity to volunteer.

Speaker 5:          00:12:43       So during one of the classes they would have, you know, like in my case, it was a rainy day. We're in a gym just like 607 and people sitting on the floor and it had stage up front with sidesteps and a cook would come up to say, hey, the coolest mos, you'll never go hungry with us. And they're all fat and slop, you know, just will cooks. And then other guys couldn't for Camo, Intel, mps, that kind of stuff. At the very end, this little banty rooster comes in and it was raining. So every bottles had arraign jackets and stuff on as banty rooster comes in with a Bray, his and his fatigues are wet. He came up and did a straight jump onstage, turned around and said, um, we're looking for recruits for special forces, if you, if you're interested, see me outside fact, anybody interested?

Speaker 5:          00:13:32       Well Hell, I read the book. I jumped up off the floor, me about three other guys and the other 700 just sat down going like, WTF, you guys had gone to nom to a couple weeks. I'm going to give just a little bit more training here. It was just amazing. So he jumped off the stage and that's it. So he ran us through the psychological tests, had to show we could swim, run all that stuff. And were you a calm guy initially? Did you get trained as a calm guy? Yes he is. Do they still call 18 echo back then or knows? This is pre historic gunfire forest. The forest is the, a SF designator. Got It. And Oh five B is Comma Morris Code. And then after training group we sent, they sent us down for 12 weeks to Fort Gordon for RTT cause they need a lot of AA camps and core c and c needed some RTT operators, radio teletype.

Speaker 5:          00:14:22       And so that was the extra training and that's where I got busted. Me and Johnny McIntyre got busted down to private e Dukes. So we landed a non words you what'd you do to earn that? Oh well we're just assholes really. I mean these are, these are butter bars too. Young, new tennis. They get this company and here come these green berets. We just got done all our training. We're official green barrettes right. You're the baddest man on the planet here. I still read your buddy. So what? I have my article 15 with the CEO. I go in and there's eight article fifteens on the tail. He says, pick one. I've picked one, scratched it up and threw it out because you got nine. Now I've got me and Maca target busted. So as he deuce landed the knobs and he dues. Yeah. So he gets it.

Speaker 5:          00:15:09       So, so it wasn't till you got to Vietnam, correct? That you heard about CNC or, no, you said some training instructors do Combo, well you know here, one of these little sidebars and we go through Camo, myself, McIntyre and a few of us got recycled because you had to get up to a, I forget 12 or 15 groups [inaudible] or something. Yeah. WPS. I had to with the seal team, I went to a course like when the last guys that were learning Morse code and we had to get whatever it was, I think we had a lower standard than that cause we, cause it wouldn't just, no one would if you want to, even my officer then couldn't give you the officer out.

Speaker 5:          00:15:48       So no, but we, one of our guys who took us under his wing was a guy named Paul Villa. Rosa SFC been a non three times, had a little tattoo around his neck cut here. And uh, but he, he helped us, he got us gone. So in our mind, he, and we had a Weidner and Russo, two other instructors for two oh five B and so one day got to know us near the end. It's like, hey, you guys go, don't do it as foul to your stuff. Get an AA camp, learn about the people, Blah Blah, blah. Okay. That's what it came down to. So when we get that briefing and the top secret briefing, and one of the first things we hear about from Scuttlebutt Paul Villa Rosa was Kia the first Kia out of a fob four at the time, which was in January of 68 so here's one of our living legends who got us in the SF, trained us up is Kia.

Speaker 5:          00:16:38       And that had us talk about psyops. It hit hard, but you, but so that was in Vietnam when Nate for when they now said to you, okay, do you want to be a part of this other program? Do you want to go one more volunteer route? And ended up here? Yes sir. Of course you're like, yeah, let's bring it, let's go young and dumb. And then, so then, so then you immediately got assigned, they said right away to test to screen you or anything. Any, anything else? They just said, oh cool. Or you're, you're smart enough to volunteer. Yeah, I've got a vet. He had been done and uh, all of us either had the top secret or it was in process. And so, uh, from near literally the next day of plaintiff Denang up north and then we had the briefing and uh, and of course, you know, we had a safe house. The denying where does there's house 22, that's our safe house and welcome to special forces, you know. And that was a safe house. It was run by either us or s agency or both. And um, you know, you'd go in and here's old SF guys. In fact it was one of the teams just got back from trying to rescue one of our hatchet forces

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       and they're just sitting there to talk about the combat and Maca and [inaudible] oh shit, we're going to really die. It's a good thing we spent our money cause we, cause when we were going through the a r t t training, we had a weekend pass. We'd go up and we were in Washington. When we see the Tet offensive and the tanks are running over Lang VA, the AA camp at Line Bay one oh one and we go, we know we're going to die with high degree of certainty. So we went home, took our money out of bank, all of our principal earns with $1,000 we ate steak dinners until he went to Vietnam. So there'll be worth this house 22 and we're thinking about the same thing as guy. Oh Shit. We're really into it now. And so we'd go upstairs, take showers in the showers. A couple of these hookers that are in there do Chanel would with coke, Coca Cola and they're cleaning up. Just like welcoming you here. A couple of guys getting a load in the back there and they're all pumping away. It's like, oh this is really cool. It tells but this side of Vietnam,

Speaker 4:          00:18:49       here we go. Yeah. So bring it on. We're ready. And then, and then you talked about that flight up to the first place you got assigned to us. It was fob one [inaudible] we was called fob. Where you guys call it a [inaudible] generation. I guess we're, I guess we're cutting corners over here. Okay, so you're going to fob one caught anything to like still get your leaf to supper? Well, there's a whole, there's a whole lot, there's a whole offshoot of the word fob, which we turned into fob. Have you ever heard the term fob it before? Yes. Yes. So someone that stays on the fob and never goes out.

Speaker 4:          00:19:26       Yeah. So notice if rents, yeah, well, yes, the ramps is, is is what you guys called them. And I don't know if the name of my consulting company is echelon front and the reason we called the company echelon front is because we wanted people to know that we were the guys that were like in the front, not the, not the ramps, which is specifically taken from David Hackworth book. Indeed. Read a ton of times up. Me Too. How was it? Yeah. Awesome. And flying up into fob one. Right. With the King B. Yeah. How was that? It's just another day in the secret war, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:20:03       because they had the old eight-thirty 30 fours and so the pilots set up high and then you had the, the, the uh, apartment in the back for the passengers and there's a door gunner. So when Mack attire, me and John, uh, Hutchens get on the eight 34 is the door is only on the right side. So we all get in and I see the helicopter polygon. I mean the gunner gone was the gunner Vietnamese. Yeah. This is all Vietnamese [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:20:29       were you, were you ready for that? Mentally? Not at all. Okay. Cause like, yeah, cause I guess one more important note to make to everyone so that the, the aircraft is being flown by a Vietnamese pilot with a Vietnamese copilot and a Vietnamese gunner.

Speaker 3:          00:20:43       Yeah. It was the two 19th, a special operations squadron for the South Vietnamese Air Force and uh, all pilots. And so, you know, our training was, we are going to work with the people there, the indigenous people. But when you literally climb it to their helicopter and your life is now in their hands, that's like, you know, we did upgrade, you messed the code, didn't really think about it much, but it was taken us a couple steps jumping in and going like, now WTF to what's going on here now. I thought we have, you know later he you, he like we've seen in the movie with John Wayne, they all had you is not this old age 30 force of course keep thing, you know, and that has it in the engine and that was a be 17 a rotary engine.

Speaker 1:          00:21:28       Yeah. And then we're going to get into the factor of how those guys prove themselves over and over and over and over again to be just incredibly brave and not, not just incredibly good pilots, but just brave beyond comprehension. When you were fine up there, was it, was it a mellow flight up there or was it cool?

Speaker 3:          00:21:46       Yeah, it was a beautiful day. You know, it's warm, like it's always hot, but once you get air you get to flow. You know how it is when you were flying through. And we go on over to cemeteries and everything and we're going down highway one, which is heading north from Denang up to food buy. And we went past the food by airport. And so we're flying north when the west side of the highway one and you see the airport and then there's this big compound, which was the second, uh, Arbonne division training cramp company. And then all of a sudden it's like you're flying north and then you're on your side looking straight down at the rail. You did a 90 degree flip as it begins to turn. So I seen the guy talking the door gunner, like doing this crunchy thing, you know, could we all had our new fatigues and you could just tell where newbies, disgusting newbies. Green asked me grays, man, this guy's going to have his kick. So I was kinda thinking something's going to happen. What is it? Well, Maca targets gs and Hutchins goes the same way. And I watched the guy, so we did the, you know, you look down, there's the road. And the first time we'd had a helicopter with that kind of a radical ride. And so he did a one 80 then came back and did a three 60 and landed. We get off while we get off and then a recon team gets on disappears

Speaker 1:          00:23:06       was that, was that spike team Idaho that got on right. Okay. So, so that happens the ones year as the bracelet right there and that does, you got off that bird that brought you into fob one and, and it was despite team Idaho that got on board.

Speaker 3:          00:23:22       Yup. Cleanline was the one zero and Robert own was the one one with four indigenous troops were five indigenous troops

Speaker 1:          00:23:30       and and so you start your checking and whatever and then whatever, however many hours goes by and all of a sudden what's happening on camp when you start to realize that something's gone sideways.

Speaker 3:          00:23:40       Well, you know, I was very fortunate and went with B training group. I was a catcher and play center field, a company softball team and we went on to feed at that summer. And the reason why spider parks, Robert J spider parks was our pitcher. And that little skinny ass Texan could bring it. And we still played fast pitch none of this wimpy slow-pitch shit. And so we won our games. And uh, so I come in, we land Mack, Tara and I are in Hutchinson and we're like literally walking in front of the [inaudible] office. Just had a long road that went from highway one east into the compound. The training centers on the right saw new, we hear to Vietnamese and we hear a Cambodians on the left. If you go down and we get in and take our stuff out, we're just standing looking stupid. And then here comes spider parks and it's like, Whoa, am I glad to see you? Could we use it? We were both in a company together, spent many months there training up before we came

Speaker 1:          00:24:35       and now he, but he wasn't the one that told you what was going on with

Speaker 3:          00:24:39       no cause, right at that point it was like, hey, and I got a spirit bunk. If he goes in and talks to the sergeant majors as I noticed, asshole, I'm gonna bring him in with me for a couple of days. And we'll see what's going to happen. Cause at that point a spider had been on Idaho, had run four or five missions with the sergeant lane and then Lane said you're ready for your own team. So he promotes them off, they appoint them as a one zero. And so he was in that interim time waiting for the transition to come where he's going to get assigned a team. And uh, so he's in base team goes out. So he's got a high degree of interest in what their statuses. So the Mr First Kamel check, they gave a team. Okay. Which in our case, once you're on the ground, usually wait about 10 minutes to see what's going on around you gave a team. Okay. Then the assets leave cause they can't stay that long anyway. At least the helicopters that they had back

Speaker 1:          00:25:32       which the team. Okay. Was a break and squelch on the radio. Right. Generally Joanie

Speaker 3:          00:25:37       speaking. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:25:39       Those either don't know. What that is is when you break, we squeeze the handset on the radio. It made, you can tell on the other end. Okay. They just purposefully squeezed that microphone three times. We know that that's the signal for okay. Right.

Speaker 3:          00:25:52       And sometimes like early on, the guys may say, um, Timo k. But yeah, later on I saw it was just Sprake break and then they say, okay, then Covey will leave. So they were in and then spider came back later. He goes, hey, we haven't heard from Idaho. So by dinnertime, hey, we haven't heard by head Oho we haven't heard from them. We're really concerned about what's going on here. And then by the morning, uh, they're still at that point, not, not a word.

Speaker 1:          00:26:22       And W at what point did you guys get word?

Speaker 3:          00:26:25       I know I'm hazy on how many, what the day or timeframe was, but eventually, uh, another day decided that had been too long. No Camo. They put in what they call bright light, which is a team that's goes into either find the other team, if there's casualties or down pilots. That's what the light mission is. Word

Speaker 5:          00:26:44       Down Pilots, uh, bring relief or just bring casualties out or help people get the team out. The wound, the team. So they went in a team, new went in, everybody was wounded. One guy was killed. This is from the team that went in, went in for the bright light. This is, this is a Oregon, correct? Yeah, with a Mike Tucker and um, and George the troll Sternberg. They went in and at one point they were thrown a hand. They were in a bomb crater and so the NVA were hitting them with our weapons car. 15 fire. They had our m 26 fragment aides, one of which blew off George's jungle boot solid. These guys are really banged up pretty bad when they came out and when they got out

Speaker 1:          00:27:26       and they, but they didn't find anybody from Idaho. Correct. I'm going to take it back to the book here. This is sort of the, this is, this is the reaction back at fob one. When Oregon comes back back at base, there was a collective sigh of relief that s t Oregon had survived the short lived but furious but ferocious bright light mission. The loss of Estee, Idaho, however, hung over the camp like an invisible fog. Spider was the first person I spoke to. After that bright light, he went straight to the bar, unable to believe that STI, Idaho advantaged the complete lack of clues added to the mystery where they killed, where they wounded, captured, and now prisoners of the NBA McEntire voiced everyone's next thought before he be captured by the NBA. He said he'd kill himself with around from his car, 15 or pretend to be dead and blow up as many NBA as possible with one final hand grenade.

Speaker 1:          00:28:30       There was no doubt in my mind I'd never be taken alive from that day forward. I always carried an m 26 frag grenade on the upper hook of my web gear. It was the last one I'd used, I would use welcome to c and c McIntyre muttered. We had heard about s t ASP from fob for vanishing and Laos presumed Kia on 28 March, 1968 but there were others. Sergeant First Class, Robert L. Taylor killed four April, s t bear from fob three Kia, Laos major George Cuomo. You. 17 crashed, died 14 April fob, five base spike team members, Sergeant FirstClass, Leroy and right and Staff Sergeant Lloyd f Lasalle Kia Fish Hook area of Cambodia. Two may fob, two based Lieutenant Joseph C Shreve Kia hatchet force operation. One may fob one based s t Alabama team members specialist fifth class Kenneth M, crying at Private First Class Paul Chester King Kia, a Shao target for May fob one hatchet for Sergeant First Class Ronald J.

Additionally, five SF troops were killed at Fox fob three from mortar and artillery shrapnel between 15 and 21 April, 1968 specialist fifth class, Charles m Corey specialist, fifth class, Daniel F. Sandoval, Sergeant Dennis Thorpe, sergeant first class, Stephan Mazac and specialist fifth class. Samuel R. Hughes.

Speaker 6:          00:30:37       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:30:38       McEntire and I didn't personally know any of the Kiis, but the sheer number in that short period of time was sobering. Most of them were veteran special forces, soldiers being as green as we were, made us all the more nervous but not scared enough to quit CNC.

Speaker 6:          00:31:02       That's uh, that's,

Speaker 1:          00:31:04       that's quite the, quite the welcome aboard.

Speaker 3:          00:31:07       Oh yeah. And then do one little side note on spider parks. Um, on that bright light when a team came out there was so shot up because one of the team members got decently wounded on the distraction that they never gave a team. Okay. Spider went down with a King B separate. King B got out looking to make sure everybody was out and he took, they took a tense fire that king B got fired up and on extraction the door gunner was Kia on that. So spider was um, quite a mess when he got back.

Speaker 6:          00:31:44       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:31:46       yeah, that's, that was such a short period of time to be losing all those guys. That's a matter of months.

Speaker 3:          00:31:51       Oh yeah. And we left several out.

Speaker 1:          00:31:57       Um, so these, uh, these spike teams going in explore, will you explain a little bit about what the spike teams were like? What it consisted of?

Speaker 3:          00:32:07       The spike teams was a code name for our recon teams. You had two basic elements with CNC to hatch, a forest, which could be a company platoon or a company size operation. And then the recon teams, which we had would be two or three Americans with a, the corresponding number of indigenous troops. So initially we ran three Americans with three south Vietnamese and the South Vietnamese on our team were really good. And then later they're so good. I just ran myself

Speaker 5:          00:32:40       one on one, one with four ditch and uh, we trained up heavily particularly up to that. And then, uh, um, learn who the best ones were. And we had a couple of the guys who had been like Hep or interpreter Soule who had been near date men running missions for over two years by 68. So they were highly respected. In fact, um, only by the grace of God, they warn on the team that disappeared cause we were able to build around them. Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:33:12       You have this other part in the book here. This is another sort of welcome to fob one. During the, during the first few weeks in fob one, I attended at least three memorial services for fallen SF comrades. Services were held in the mess hall. The last one I attended was for lane and Owen's during the service, the chaplain hesitated on Lane's name. This was the last official function honoring spite team, Idaho's members. And the chaplain couldn't remember lane's name. I didn't care if he had attended a dozen memorial services for other branches of the military that day. I was so angry. I never attended another memorial service. That fob one. The services soon stopped anyway because there were so many casualties, no official announcement. They just stopped. Oh yeah. You and I were talking a little bit about, uh, Ramadi when we were in Ramadi and the, you know, one thing that we started doing immediately was going to the memorial services of the soldiers and marines that were getting killed. And that was a big wake up call for everybody. Uh, I can tell you, I don't think probably anyone in my task unit had ever been to a,

Speaker 1:          00:34:29       yeah, I had ever been to a memorial service overseas for guys that have been killed. I mean, and here we were. There were, they were happening every day. You never think about it. No. Until you're there now and you guys were having so many casualties that they just said, okay, well we're not even going to have them anymore.

Speaker 2:          00:34:48       Ah,

Speaker 1:          00:34:50       here's talking about some of your first few operations that you went on and I don't think I've talked about this, but so these little teams that you had, yeah. These little teams, we're getting into helicopters and flying over the fence, which means over the border into Laos and Cambodia to do reconnaissance pretty much in the middle of nowhere by yourselves. Correct. This type of operation in present day is not very likely to happen. The, the amount of risk that you guys were taking. It's, it's crazy to read about, like my, my personal contingency that I'm running through my head. You know, what if this happened, what if that happens? Right. I'm looking at these same, yeah. If I was the commander in charge, I'd say, well, you need to come up with a better plan. You need to come up with something where we have better backup, especially when the situation is because you guys can get air support and you guys used it heavily. But yeah, as soon as the weather rolled in, it was like you guys are out there on your own. And I mean, we'll get into some stories where you're out on your own for sure.

Speaker 5:          00:36:03       And you know, and uh, um, is that, that element of it is, uh, an extra contingency. We had no artillery, no traditional army or Marine Corps support and of course no seal teams. Yeah. They were busy doing this stuff on the coast. And uh, so it was quite something to go across the fence. And in a way, we're flying into the 18th century because everything was so old, the way of working. And they said do slash and burn agriculture. So you'd come in with a helicopter, everybody would hear you comment and the local people had to cooperate with the NVA or because their model was work with us or we're going to kill your dumb ass. So, um, the game was on

Speaker 1:          00:36:51       and the purpose of most of these was to figure out where the trails were, what was being transported, where the location of enemy personnel, where it was bay. It was your basic reconnaissance missions, right?

Speaker 5:          00:37:01       Well, in addition to, yes, that was the first part. So you always had general missions, either a point mission a cause. By the end of 68, they were building fuel lines from the north. They were coming down near gone across the DMZ river in Lagos. And uh, so we heard reports about that. So that could be a point mission or a general [inaudible] where the movement's gone, what supplies are and then wiretaps peel w snatch. And um, those were the other missions. And so our, our south Vietnamese are trained, we trained them up. So back then we had stayed Yardi cassette player, right.

Speaker 5:          00:37:41       And South could climb up a telephone pole, hook it up and it covered a wire all the way up with mud. So if anybody walked past, they would never see that wire and we would record, cause the CIA told us if you record, even though you don't hear anything, keep it on. Cause we get this taste back to us, we're going to amplify it a hundred times because the north Vietnamese phones, even though we're in the cradle, there is still on and, and we could record it date amplifying that. You hear people talking in the background, get into off of that. So those are some of the other missions.

Speaker 1:          00:38:16       So you start going on your first few operations here. Um, and by the next morning, back to the book, by the next morning, the weather had broken and we were inserted smack dab in the middle of the biggest road running north to south through the a Shau Valley. Am I saying that right? Asheville Ashaw valley. Uh, there was no jungle. There were hundreds

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       of bomb craters of various sizes. But what surprised me the most was the number of Punji pits that we passed. Some were huge, large enough for animals and you go through this mission is one of your first missions and there's like no enemy contact. And one of the guys who are with walking in, I looked at each other in complete disbelief. We had just walked down into the valley of the shadow of death without seeing one NVA soldier spider joke with me saying that I was one of the few people in the history of CNC to have a run, a practice mission and two missions and still have not gotten the combat infantry men's batch, the award given to soldiers who had seen combat with the enemy or were under direct hostile fire. I kept telling myself that this was a fluke and I remembered what the special forces trainers told us at Fort Bragg, the NVA and the Vietcong guerrillas will fight when they want to know sooner. So your first couple of operations, you got pretty uh, pretty lucky. Oh yeah, we're a slitter snails not wounded. Could we put it in those air force sensors? And then we had all this heres tack air stacked up because we just figured it's going to be a shit show. Nothing happened. So we left out some poor guy, supportive VA gunner opens up with a 50 caliber. They killed him several times man. The napalm bombs cause they want to use something on this big mission.

Speaker 4:          00:39:56       Where you uh, the other interesting that you talk about in the book, uh, I don't think it was one of yours, but even when you guys would do training missions over there, there was like a potential for enemy contact on your training missions. Absolutely. Yeah. Lynne black and his team, they ran a heavy contact. In fact it was the navy to save their dumb ass at one training mission cause they just happen to have the frequency to kink bees couldn't get in and they called the navy and they came out of a big boat. Yeah. Yeah. Some kind of boat that's really long. But he came in and pulled her ass out cause they the via Kaya must've a couple hundred people who were coming after and they were just out trying to do like a shakeout patrol. Just a little training operation. Yeah, just a little in country thing.

Speaker 4:          00:40:36       You know this is just go train, get a couple of days, get out of camp, eat some Eastland loops, have some fun. Okay, well you're a, your luck didn't hold up. I guess going back to the book and is this guys named south? Am I saying that right? Perfect. Okay. Bye now. So eyes were sow's. Eyes were bigger than sauces. So you've been inserted and now you, you're starting to have a situation unfold. If you raised spider walk and said, tell him I'm declaring prairie fire emergency. If he says anything about not hearing any gunshots, tell him to fuck off. I'll explain later. Sal's never been wrong. Look at him as we spoke, sal looked at us. Boku VC Beaucoup, VC call King B's now he whispered. And then you get on the horn. I have a prairie fire emergency team in distress. I have a prairie fire emergency. Can anyone hear me? I spoke in a hushed tone with my hand cupped over the mouth. The radio. I looked at my watch. We still had more than a hundred minutes before our next scheduled Camo check with spider at 1600 no one responded.

Speaker 4:          00:41:45       So the, the deal with calm windows are back in the day when we had batteries that would run out. You couldn't just sit there and monitor the radio all the time on either side. [inaudible] people that were waiting for you to call, they'd be waiting and they didn't want to, they wouldn't monitor the whole time. So they would come up at certain predesignated communication windows. So that's what's going on here. You have this bad situation unfolding and you go to call, but they're not particularly listening in at that moment, which is why no one's responding. Right. Yeah. I'm just explaining that to some folks that because nowadays we have, well first of all, we have cell phones. When we call anyone, whenever we want to make some nice ring tone. And you've talked to everyone through and even when I got in we had calm windows. Yeah, yeah, we, yeah, we set up call.

Speaker 4:          00:42:30       I was a common guy too. Sure. Yet we set up calm windows and we'll call you, you know, whatever it was every two hours or whatever. And that's the situation that's unfolding right here. You guys still hadn't been contacted yet. So back to the book, I sat down with my back against the PRC 25 and opened a can of Apricot's I was facing south and just starting to sip the sweet apricot nectar. When all hell broke loose, the green jungle around us are ruptured with definitely full automatic blasts from NVA, AK 47 and our car fifteens because my back was to them, I hadn't seen Sal's warning gestures or watched him get the jump on the approaching NVA. I remember spilling apricot nectar on the stock of my car. 15 as I turned to my left where the majority of the NVA gunfire was coming from foolishly, my first thoughts were that I would have to clean off the nectar off my weapon and not spill the entire Canada, Africa, Apricot's because I had waited so damn long to eat them.

Speaker 4:          00:43:30       They were always a treat in the jungle. But the initial seconds of the firefight, I remember Sao and, how do I say his name? Fuck Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck. Yelling. Pro-Family profanities at the NBA as they fired on full automatic, the crack of AK 47 rounds had never sounded louder or closer. All I could see from our perimeter was Gunsmoke the red and orange blasts coming from the darker than ever. Green jungle and the green AK 47 tracers flying over our heads. In an odd sort of way, there was an eerie beauty to the scene. The funder's fury of dozens of men blasting away at each other on full automatic within 10 feet of each other, killed all other sounds. The eardrums were numb. Adrenaline had slammed into our bloodstreams and was now screaming through our systems. It heightened all senses. It extended time. For example, a car 15 fires, 20 rounds of five, five six high velocity ammunition in less than one and a half seconds. Yet those first opening moments of combat with the NVA seemed much longer than a half a second. Then the second and a half. Ordinarily when firing on full

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       automatic, the weapon expended rounds quickly and we trained ourselves to try and gauge when that last round in the magazine was slamming into the receiver. Some men placed to trace around in the magazine as a visual cue. During that firefight, it seemed as though I counted the rounds, leaving the car 15 and knew exactly when the 18th and last round was exiting the weapon. Also, during that first experience, exchange fork was slightly behind me to my right and since I was on the ground he was firing over my shoulder. That exposed my right ear to almost a full blast from his car. 15 the explosions were painful, but fox saved my life. I had aimed the car 15 down the hill. Toward the largest number of AK 47 muzzle flashes that I could see to my left. What I hadn't seen were a handful of a handful of NVA soldiers who broke out of the jungle to the right and it opened fire on us.

Speaker 1:          00:45:21       Folk realized I hadn't seen the NVA troops coming up the hill, so we got to my right and blasted them back into the jungle. I was so focused on the first muzzle flashes that I completely missed the others. If those NVA soldiers had advanced a few more feet, we would have been history and the remainder of the team which was on my left would have been at risk. That time warp continued when everybody ran out of bullets simultaneously. The only audible, the only sounds audible were the metal clips of cold magazines being slammed into hot machine guns and bolts slamming shut to resume the firefight. A key element in any firefight is the race to reload. After the initial contact on seven October, 1968 s t Idaho won the race. No one was faster than Sao heap. Hip Hip folk at getting the first magazine out, the second one in and returning full automatic gunfire on the enemy within seconds. We had gained fire superiority, the months and months of training on the range under the tutelage of spider, spider and Walken, all of the live fire drills, all the live fire races to see who finished reloading first paid off. All other games in life were frivolous and irrelevant in this deadly game. If you missed hitting the target, you died.

Speaker 1:          00:46:45       So that was your first big contact, Huh?

Speaker 5:          00:46:47       That was it. That's a doozy. It was absolutely. And uh, it still sticks with us, you know, you know, never forget it and fuck. I mean later on we're back in base. I was complaining cause I didn't realize what had happened. And so talking through Hap, the interpreter said, you dumb fucker. I just saved your ass. These guys would come up the hill and you're too stupid to realize it. Oh, so you were mad at him for students who goes to year, could my ears just fuck, I couldn't hear for days. It's like, so thanks for saving my life. I'm complaining, right? Oh, classic. Oh yeah. You continue on with this a little bit as as we gained complete fire superiority. I on the URC

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       10 beeper and started screaming into the PRC 25 I have a fucking prairie fire emergency. That bitter fear laced plea was greeted with complete silence. Wolken was less than subtle. Keep yelling until you get someone. A key factor in STI, Idaho's favor that day was the small knoll that woken has driven us to. The jungle is so thick and the knoll was so small that only a score of NVA could rush at once. They weren't moving, they weren't fast moving fear, inspiring charges that the NBA were known for successfully executing either here or the jungle worked against them, but the NVA kept coming. At one point woke and pulled me over, pointed into the jungle and said, look, they're stacking up dead bodies to get to us. Hip showed me, can you believe it? And they keep coming. Hell, if we kill enough of them, the body stack will be as high as we are because the jungle area was so dark at first. I couldn't tell exactly what I was looking at. But woken was right. The NVA were stacking bodies and firing at us from behind. They're dead comrades. A lot of NVA soldiers died in those first few minutes of hell on earth.

Speaker 3:          00:48:39       It's a determined enemy. Oh yeah. And we heard about, you know, it's one thing that do hear about it basic and, and, uh, special forces training, how determined the enemy was. And uh, to see it firsthand dying like that, I mean literally just kept coming and we had high ground, you know, thank God for high ground, the thick jungle and the fact that it wasn't a, a big, big area where he could mass more.

Speaker 1:          00:49:07       Did you guys didn't bring a, you guys didn't have an automatic weapon with you. You guys didn't have an AWS like I had like a belt fed machine gun. You guys wouldn't carry those?

Speaker 3:          00:49:14       No, we had a sit, well nick k six man team and the teams on the teens began carrying the a m 60 a little later. And then, uh, the RPG cause the cut the barrel off and it had the, um, the magazine of the, uh, circular, um, magazine, the hills things too hard, 250 rounds. But they were some that did it. But in our case, because we cardium 79 also to Sawed-off m study nine or collect gave you a lot of extra firepower.

Speaker 1:          00:49:44       Did you use the full shat rounds with that or just the, just the

Speaker 3:          00:49:47       brown would be fleshed yet. So if anything was close, that would be the first round. And that we need the hes, we had the rounds,

Speaker 1:          00:49:55       but no, AWS man, that's it. This I, when I hear that story right there, I would do anything to have an m 60 machine gun in the situation. Absolutely.

Speaker 3:          00:50:06       The weight, the rounds and everything else. You know, like in my case, I carried the radio, always cared to radio and so between the radio to battery and we always had 600 plus rounds.

Speaker 1:          00:50:16       We were, um, we, I was on my first deployment to Iraq. I was on like one of my first patrols in Humvees and we were out and we, we ended up, we hit

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       a, uh, a little, I dunno what you call them, the steel hedgehog. Do you know what that is? It's like a little obstacle, right? That Americans had put out American didn't put it out a steel hedgehog. A little, it's like a little obstacle for those of you who don't know it's to prevent cars from going by. Well, we were, we, we made a wrong turn somewhere and we went down a road we weren't supposed to go to and we hit a one of those little steel hedgehogs. We didn't know what it was. So we're driving along, he's actually my Humvee too, and it, it made a loud noise and sparked and I actually thought in my mind, I thought we just got hit with a low order IUD, like a low order Boothby booby trap that didn't fully explode. So we come to a stop and we all get out of the vehicles and now we're in the middle of Baghdad.

Speaker 4:          00:51:11       And then we're just surrounded by threats. And in our mind we're about to be attacked. Cause we didn't know that we had just ran over our old American thing. But we're two still still. You don't know. We don't know that. So everyone's out there and we're off there with our, with our m fours, our little basically car fifteens. Yeah. And you like, I felt, I felt completely naked. I was saying to myself, God, we don't like, we need better weapons now. We had 50 cals mounted in the Humvees, but you know, once we were mobile, I'm thinking we do. Why don't we have, why don't we have, you know, belt fed machine guns. When I got, when we got back that night, it wasn't just me that felt like, cause that because that night all my guys, they went in every Humvee, everyone put belt fed machine guns, we mounted them, we staged them.

Speaker 4:          00:51:52       So anytime we got out of those vehicles, we were ready to go to war. Oh yeah, yeah. Protecting a situation like that because you could have on limits that people come in nuts, but yet that naked feeling. Yeah, cause an a w in a situation like this roof. That'd be nice. Going back to the book for more than an hour, my cries and screams into the radio and the URC 10 beeper went unanswered. As the NBA mounted more attacks, there was no need for radio secure procedures. Now the hide and seek portion of the game was over. Now it was simply a matter of survival. My respect for the NBA, his tenacity grew that day, but the hill, the jungle and our car fifteens worked against them as they continue to pile up or drag away more bodies with no help around conserving ammo while keeping the enemy back became a top priority.

Speaker 4:          00:52:41       There were no more full automatic blasts from us. Although we had been in contact less than two hours. It felt like we'd been fighting for several as the team anxiously awaited for help from above, the few team members pitted against the enemy. NVA seemed ludicrous in terms of survival. The enormity of the jungle hit home. Yes. Are you got, how many rounds did you say you would bring? We always carried 600 plus per man. Oh No. The Vietnamese would carry a load a load cause they could cause they're small like 98 pounds. So I forget what their load when you guys had 20 round magazines at this point, right? Correct. 30 we're just a dream. We thought about and a couple of guys was far enough to to, to colt

Speaker 5:          00:53:26       order and they had a mail to him later. We weren't that smart. So we had the 20 rounds. But because of the spring you only put 18 then. Yeah. And so you're taking this at some point, probably. How long into this are you starting to take point shots instead of Oh yeah. You just wait until things come out. You see it and then just one to find the, I heard the Texas drawl of spider on the radio, an f four phantom jet returning from a bombing run in northern Laos had heard the beeper and called him. I told spider, we had a Perry Fryer, prairie fire emergency spider, said that he had also called the judge and the executioner who the judge and the executioner, they were a pilots for the one 76 days, American America Division and they would have muskets. Okay. And uh, they had been assigned permanently to CNC earlier in the year. Navy built the camp duck and then, um, they'd been assigned own camp. Duck was closed down. They came to food by nasty, built a barracks that the helicopter positive stay stand Nero wanted to cruise them. And the Marine Corps as Scarface a were gunships that regularly hung out with us, saved our bacon. So, um, the, the judge he had, they had these old gun shifts, they could barely get off the ground, but he had the rocket pods and then, uh, the executioner was a cook and he had the, a mini gun,

Speaker 1:          00:54:54       some awesome call science. Oh yeah. Going back to the book, thankfully we had made mirror contact with spider earlier and he was able to pinpoint our location in a matter of minutes. Soon spider was over us. He told me to pop smoke. Our Sop was not to say what color smoke grenade we would use, assuming the NVA or monitoring our FM frequency. I popped a yellow smoke. He said he saw two yellows, which meant the NVA were monitoring our frequency and it guessed which color we would use. We change frequencies and I popped a violet smoke. A few minutes later, the first a one e Skyraider arrived on target and made a gun run on our eastern perimeter. His wing man made the first napalm round on the south side. Put your heads down. I'm going to make you sweat. He said he brought it so close we could feel the heat from the deadly jelly. A few seconds later, we smelled burning flesh. He dived toward us a third time. The pilot drawed, it's crispy critter time.

Speaker 1:          00:55:52       The napalm run was so close we could feel the air being sucked away from us by the exploding material. If the Jelly had landed on a person's skin, it would continue to burn either until it burned itself out or as deprived of air by mud or some other substance. The spats arrival changed the temple, the firefight. When the NVA heard the old World War II plane making another run, they charged us in D in a desperate attempt to get as close as they could in order to avoid the Sky Raiders, deadly ordinance, the n NVA. We're getting close to the belt. That's horrifying. So for those that don't understand tactics of that situation, you've got aircraft overhead. They're dropping napalm. So what are the v you think? Oh cool. That'll make the NVA runaway. No, no. Actually what they want to do is get close enough to Americans that they can't get napalm dropped on them.

Speaker 5:          00:56:37       And by 68 they had the tacky down really tight. They knew when the air per there that they were safer to closer to us. And then so they get closer. Hopefully the wipe us out and saved their own ass.

Speaker 1:          00:56:49       That's like there's, I guess there's no higher motivation than that napalm coming at you if you stay where you're at. Nasty.

Speaker 5:          00:56:59       And so therefore, even at that stage of the game, we had to go back to four matic couple of times cause they're charging hard. Oh yeah. What numbers are we talking about? No, never knew. We just stacked them muscle high. We'd never had, you know, no time to go do a body count. You know how that is. Yeah. You're just busy killing them.

Speaker 1:          00:57:15       Yeah. I don't want to throw that out. This all nonchalant like, yeah, I know how that is. No, actually we never stacked up body still high that we lost count. Uh, going back to the book, then an Air Force pilot and an air for fandom arrived on station. Tell your people the ordinance will arrive on target before you hear me or the rounds. The pilot said, I told the team to put their heads down. The phenomenon of having bullets tearing into a target before anyone could hear the aircraft with delivered them was unbelievable. The jungle in front of us was shredded by the air force gun run within a minute or two. His wing man dropped two 500 pound bombs. The change in aircraft staggered the NVA for a few moments right then and there. I thank the Lord for Uncle Sam's air force. The judge and the execution are rolled in right behind the fast mover. The judges mini gun was real close to our perimeter. Seconds later, the execution followed behind him firing several 2.75 millimeter rockets while his door gunners blasted away with their m 60 machine guns because we hadn't expended any ordinance to our west. We ran the gunships over the western edge of our perimeter. They drew no enemy fire either.

Speaker 1:          00:58:27       About a half an hour before dusk spider told us the king bees were on their way. By that time the judge and the executioner had refueled reloaded and were returning a few minutes in front of them. Everyone in s t Idaho was dangerously low on ambient ammo grenades and m 79 rounds. So now you've got the the extract platforms are coming back. The king bees are coming to get you.

Speaker 1:          00:58:51       Before the king bees moved in, an attempt to pick us up. Spider had the judge and the executioner make gun runs so close to our perimeter that we could hear the expended shell casings from the gun ships and the 60 and mini guns falling to Earth. Through all of the excitement I told walking and that spider had spotted an area west of our perimeter where king B might be able to settle into some elephant grass for us walking in and hip pass the word to the team. And we started moving toward the area from our location. We couldn't the elephant grass and I had assumed we were locked into double or triple canopy jungle. Again, the judge and executioner hammered our eastern flank as we moved toward the tentative LZ. So I got x or I if you could explain spider's position a little bit because that's pretty, I think it's pretty unique to Vietnam of how those guys could be up overhead. Sort of watching and, and directing.

Speaker 5:          00:59:47       Yeah, there, um, we called and copied the code name was Covey, Cov, e y [inaudible], but they would afford air controllers basically. And in the CNC mission, um, you have an air force pilot at that time, most of the, uh, cubbies were, oh two says no two dead. It pushed pool double engine. And um, but they always would have, uh, a prior one, zero somebody with experience who had been on a ground who'd be with the air force pilot. So the pilot would fly, then he would turn the radios over. So to spider or whoever the copywriter was. So that was a, a slot. So sometimes the guys would be wounded, they couldn't go to the field, but they could fly Covey. Got It. So that when we're on the ground, we have a situation that we're dealing with, then he's able to understand it as opposed to talking to an air force pilot. Right. Who's just used to getting a bomb and drop it somewhere and talk about a contingent liabilities that spin off of a firefight. And so that was a spider's job. He was the cubby rider and he and pat walkers that day were the two cubby riders that came in and they covers until they got us out.

Speaker 6:          01:01:01       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:01:04       man. Uh, going back to the book, sound hip were covered. Our frantic desperate drive to the chopper. After taking 10 minutes to cover those last 10 yards, we reached the hovering King Bee, which is about eight feet above the ground. Fox set up an impromptu security watch on the western side of the road, or wash. A quick check of my ammunition revealed. I was down to one frag grenade, one white phosphorous grade, and two magazines of car, 15 rounds. If I didn't get extracted that last frag grenade would be mine. There was no way in hell I was going to be a pow, especially after all the NVA s t, Idaho and TAC air had killed. If I had to use it, I take as many NVA with me as I could.

Speaker 6:          01:01:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:55       That's a bold statement.

Speaker 5:          01:01:57       Oh yeah. But that, I just, uh, by that time we knew about [inaudible] is what they go on through. And we had lost a couple of guys and one of them had escaped and they were, you know, we're by now we're hearing the POW stories, right. So it's bad enough in country, but for our mission, no, wasn't going to happen. I figured it's just to sit and just try and take as many as we can. Make it a funnel contact check.

Speaker 1:          01:02:28       Now you guys eventually get to where you're loading the, the king bees, which again, these are Vietnamese pilots. They're old aircraft, right? Probably look like they were held together with duct tape.

Speaker 5:          01:02:45       Well, they always had oil and fluids inside. And so Tom, if you sat in too deep, you get the fluid on your head. But, uh, we liked them better than the UAE because they could take, they could take more hits and they had those old B 17 engines up front, the nine rotary heads and uh, they could take more hits us while we liked him. And this a cabin thin, is that how you say captain 10 10

Speaker 1:          01:03:11       at some point during the craziness, I looked up at the pilot of the King Bee Captain Tin. He was above all the madness on the ground, completely calm and collected while his aircraft took numerous hits from enemy rounds. What made his demeanor all the more extraordinary was how it contrasted with our adrenaline hype, frantic behavior on the ground. We had been fighting for hours, we were dirty, we were sweaty, and we were exhausted and there sat captain tin, cool as a rocky mountain breeze, giving the impression that it was just another milk run. It was as though he said, no sweat boys. I got all day. You just take your time, the stewardesses, we'll break out the beverages after you've secured your seats. Looking at captain tin for a brief moment, generated a mental image I'd carried with me forever. Frankly, I never understood how one man could be so steady under so much enemy fire and keep the chopper

Speaker 5:          01:04:01       hovering. Can you imagine does day I can't.

Speaker 1:          01:04:10       Yeah. Yeah, and you go into a little bit further here. A day or two after the extraction, Captain Tin and his crew came in to fob one's green baret lounge. I went in and thanked him again in ordered a couple of rounds of drink for all the king bee pilots and crew members speaking through an interpreter. Capitan said that King Bee, he flew to extract us from echo four, had 48 holes in it from an enemy ordinance sitting at the bar. Captain Tin appeared to be just as cool and above the fray of daily life as he had on seven October 10 said that an enemy round had torn a baseball sized hole through one of the rotor blades. I asked him how he could hover so long. He told me that when he piloted a helicopter, he thought only about flying. Nothing else. No enemy bullets, weather or anything. Only flying. If it's my turn to die, I die. That day wasn't my turn to die.

Speaker 5:          01:05:04       Amazing man. He's uh, he lives in Arizona today. Really? He's still alive. Yeah. Oh, we'll be having him on the podcast. Hopefully he wants to come on here. That's awesome. Uh,

Speaker 4:          01:05:19       and then you had one of your guys, and this is, uh, this is like the other end of spectrum. Like it's hard to maintain when your guys' Davidson had to talk to you when he came up and he said, Tilton, I haven't mentioned that your nickname was tilt yet. Where'd you get that nickname? Pinballs C or you play a pinball machine, you lose and walk away. Pissed off. When I lose, I shake the shit out of, get to see my nickname and neon. Then I leave. How did the SF guys know about that? How'd they learn about it from,

Speaker 3:          01:05:48       oh, this goes way back. Yeah. As a kid we used to play pinballs all the time.

Speaker 4:          01:05:53       Little anger management issues. Oh indeed. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, so Davidson, he comes up tilt. I have to tell you something, brother. I don't think I can do this. I survived Dak two brother, but I ain't seen, I never seen shit like that before in my life. We were really lucky to survive that mission. I don't think I can go on. I hate to desert you brother, but I think I want off the team.

Speaker 2:          01:06:21       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:06:21       Now I understood that look on his face from the previous day. I told Davidson that I respected his decision and I appreciate his frankness. I thought it took more courage to be honest in camp than to not say anything and go in the field. A man unsure in the field could get other team members hurt. He re I reiterated that he'd performed well under fire in echo four he hadn't run, he hadn't quit and he had demonstrated exemplary courage during the entire mission.

Speaker 2:          01:06:52       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:06:52       As we walked and talked, I put my hand on the shoulder, James, you and I had walked in, did something few men in America will ever do. We Survived Echo for and all the NVA could throw at us. There were six of us against hundreds of north Vietnamese finest. We will have, we will always have a special bond, something no one can ever take away from us. Thanks again for your honesty. I asked him if he wanted me to talk to the sergeant major or did he want to do it because he'd only been in campus short while he asked me if I wouldn't mind speaking to the sergeant major first I agreed and asked him what sort of assignment he preferred. I don't know brother. I'll need some time to get my head straight. Did you have a note in here? 32 years. 32 years later I talked to James Davidson in New Orleans on the telephone. One of the things he said was, brother, I've never been the same since those two days in Laos.

Speaker 3:          01:07:50       Oh yeah. And Guinea back to captain tin for a moment. The uh, d pulled us out and we land at Fubu by, I'd climb up the thank, we say, come on in, I'll get you a drink. He goes, no, my family is waiting for me. Do Holden dinner. No one even on that extraction that night, cause it was right at sunset. And so when we pulled out, it's one of those beautiful scenes

Speaker 5:          01:08:16       where it's dark green, evergreen of the jungle and all these little sparkling lights that are red with the green trace was coming up. If it hadn't been trace, it was just a beautiful scene. But then you realize, hey, that's the NVA still trying to shoot our dumb ass down. And it was, but then we flew, he had itself directly for a few minutes. We had the sunset because that sweet sunset, and it was at that point that sal looked at me and gave me that look, this all it was. So we, we cut the mustard. So he, you know, cause when I first got into camp, he looked at me, my came into big spider, introduce me, and he goes, he's too tall, his feet are too big and he looks stupid.

Speaker 4:          01:09:01       It took me five months to get, he'd get on his good side, but we finally got there. An Echo for all you had to do was just fend off a few hundred NVA together. Yeah. That's all it took. And, and so Davidson, so this was a volunteer to get into the program and you could add any points. Say, Hey,

Speaker 5:          01:09:18       you can quit. Oh yeah, absolutely. And no dishonor to it. Yeah. We always preferred because like with Lynn black in a and chapter six, when they came up against 10,000, one of his Americans who was a son of a general who's just dare to try and get some metals for himself, um, never fired one round and anger and prayed during the entire day, would his face in the ground, the Vietnamese were ready to kill him. So that's kind of thing that you don't want.

Speaker 4:          01:09:44       No, no, that's, that's horrible. Yeah. These, these contacts that you're getting in, I just, it's hard for me to get my head around, you know, to be out there like alone like that with, with just really limited support, you know?

Speaker 5:          01:10:02       Oh yeah, there are days, but we had Uncle Sam's air force and those door gunners are great. Yeah, absolutely. And we had Scarface, you know, from marine corps and we had different units who are attached to us and we're just really lucky whenever we call dailies came and the effect of one a Scarface, who was Lieutenant Colonel Robertson, he pulled us out several times. He pulls out. The one time he got his plexiglass shot out, the bird shot up. We get us back to Fubu, chewed my s's. Every time we come to get you. And he chewed my ass out. We go into the club. He still chewed my ass out. I bought him drinks, gone so drunk he couldn't walk. He had to fly. He's still two of my SSA kernel. But you saying you're not going to come to next ties. I didn't say that every time you rang the bell they came, but oh my God, they could barely don't ever try to the door guns. We get down to the helicopter. They're like the B or d models as really early you. He saw this is true at to muskets. The door goes out to get out and kind of lift the helicopter as they tried to get enough power to get off the ground because they're just so loaded with ordinance. Then they jump in once he got moving. Quite a sight.

Speaker 4:          01:11:15       But they always came and the other thing is that's weird is they didn't really have nighttime capability. None of it like anyone. So well, it seems like nowadays night is no factor for America. Oh, I know. We would have run over our mother for one of those dogs. Oh yeah, absolutely. Yeah. But for you guys, once the sun went down, it was hard to get picked up. It was hard to call for fire. It seems that way. Oh yeah, no doubt. And so you were racing the s you were racing the sun, you were resonate. You always, yeah, she's a, she's a key player between the weather and the sunset. Yeah. That's the other scary thing is, I mean, you know, this is something I usually say early on, but I haven't said yet. I'm reading tiny excerpts of this book. So if you're listening to the podcast, these are tiny excerpts.

Speaker 4:          01:12:06       This is less than five, less than 3% of this book. This book is filled with this kind of mayhem. So you have to get the book to appreciate it all. I'm just kind of hitting some of the highlights. But yeah, the fact that you guys were racing against the sun going down and how l the sun goes down. Okay, cool. Where do we go? Does that mean in modern day seal teams? For me that means we use a night strobe, a an an infrared strobe that the enemy can't see instead of a marking panel. What does it mean for you? It means another, another 12 hours out in the bush cause you're not getting vict up and just hope that the uh, the lions that leave you alone, you know, I mean to tigers, um, you had this one idea or you know, your, your, the group had an idea of dropping like a big giant daisy cutter, but a bit bombed like a 2000 pound bomb, right.

Speaker 4:          01:13:00       In order in areas that were so packed with, with vegetation that you couldn't get in a helicopter in there and say, oh, we got an idea, we'll just drop a big bomb. And those go land in there can get dropped off in there. And, um, so this, this one operation where you're doing that, you're, you're heading into the jungle, you're going to one of these things where you dropped a 2000 pound daisy cutter bomb, you're repelling, you're the number one man heading down, right? And you, you decide that like, hey, this is an abort situation. I think you saw some enemy. Oh yeah. And so you decide, okay, let's abort this thing and here we're going to the book. As I looked up, I was glad to see king who's one of your team members climbing back into the king bee. I got on the radio and told Covey to abort the mission as we had been compromised again for a few fleeting moments.

Speaker 4:          01:13:46       I'd considered trying to get the team on the ground. Frankly, I was sick and tired of getting shot out of LZs and I wanted to run a mission instead of going through the gut wrenching firefight, um, on the lts, which is, you know, again, I'm skipping around in this book, but you would do mission after mission where you guys would try and land and you'd get shot off the LZ. Oh yeah. Um, that'd be the primary, secondary, and then the, uh, alternative. You try three insertions, you know, I'm just gonna I'm just going to, for the record, if I go one insertion and I get shout off, I'm coming home.

Speaker 4:          01:14:20       I'm coming home. [inaudible] going to go to the secondary Ed. If I get shot off the secondary, I'm damn sure not going to the tertiary and think I'm getting away with it. I'm going to go back and come up with a new plan. Well, but then the king BW run out of gas. He had to go back. Uh, so you're there. Then I saw the helmet of an NVA soldier heading toward the bombed area. He was approaching from the area where I heard the first voice from the jungle area in front of the helicopter, which was up the hill from where I was on the ground. As soon as I saw my open fire with my car, 15, suddenly the king be swerved away, leaving me on the ground. Suddenly it was eerily quiet. Then it hit me. I was standing in the middle of a smoking LZ in the middle of Laos and I was alone.

Speaker 4:          01:15:02       All of a sudden I felt small, very small. The trees that had survived the bomb blast were tall. The jungle surrounding the LZ was both impressive and formidable and not somewhere I wanted to travel by myself. I tried to raise Covey on the radio. There was no answer from Watkins, even though I was the American team leader on s t Idaho. I insist on carrying the radio because I wanted to be the person calling air strikes around my team. The Vietnamese kept us alive in the field and I felt my end of surviving the jungle warfare was to direct tactically or strikes and helicopter gunships to the enemy.

Speaker 4:          01:15:36       So the king B comes back. So you're there, the king B comes back, captain two ong drafts a row, drops a rope down to you for you to clip into cause it's I guess too tight for it to land or it doesn't wanna land cause it's gonna take a bunch of time and energy. So they just throw you a rope yet they can't land. Cause there are too many tree stumps. They didn't cut everything down. And then at that time we were just uh, refining the tactic of using rope extractions. So for anyone that's listening right now, when you're refining tactics, try and do it on training operations. Well we did, we trained with this. We knew we had dug to 50 foot rope, a sandbag to it, and then it had a d ring on the end and be 150 foot rope. And so they had to have a sandbag.

Speaker 4:          01:16:25       So we'd get through the jungle, get to the ground to you. And we had developed other tactics, but you had a d ring on your chest. Well, you're going to get to that. Yeah. Yeah. So here we go. I saw no NVA, but the weapon that was being fired had the unmistakable bark. Renee 47. I fired another m 79 round in that direction. That rounds explosion must've startled capping Tuong because he jerked the king be upward yanking me off the ground before I could slip the d ring on my left shoulder around the rope. That shoulder d-ring was critical for staying in the Swiss seat. We had heard horror stories about the body desecration and the NVA had performed on SOG, men, and I didn't want that happening to me. As Toowong lifted me into the air, I opened fire with my car, 15 on what appeared to be a flash coming from the hilltop area. So you're getting hoisted up by the helicopter while you're returning fire and slipping out of your deep ring. It didn't quite get hooked in that. As we got a little higher up, I was ricocheting off the trees. I was, I was a human pinball for a few minutes there. Tilt. There we go.

Speaker 4:          01:17:30       Uh, then I became scared. So then you decided to become scared. Okay, that's fine. I still hadn't hooked my shoulder. D-Ring and someone fired a few green tracers out. As captain Toowong started to pull out of the target area. As he started gaining speed, I ricocheted off a few trees before I cleared the jungle. Having sat in the king bees copilot seat, I understood why he pulled away from the LZ before I had cleared the trees. If the chopper gets shot down, the mission turns into an operational nightmare while potentially injuring or killing the crew and the [inaudible] team members aboard the ship. I wasn't angry with him how he came back from me. I would have been stranded down here for at least two more hours before other choppers with ropes could have been able to extract me if he hadn't, but being dragged through the trees hurt. I was angry at myself for not getting the damn d-ring hooked before I lifted off the ground. My arms were getting very sore. As I went to switch arms, I was struck by some sort of air pocket and suddenly I was upside down at 5,000 feet.

Speaker 4:          01:18:29       My only physical link to life was the d ring hooked into my rope seat and the hundred and 50 foot piece of rope hanging from the helicopter. I twisted my body to look up at king again. Thank God he was still hanging out the door. I signaled to get the chopper to land. As I was giving king signs, I felt the rope slipping down my FYS to my knees. At the same time, my web gear was sliding from my hips over my stomach, toward my neck and a matter of moments. The Swiss seat was at my knees. The only way I stopped it from moving further was by spreading my legs. I felt really stupid after all the training. This was going to be a dumb way to die. As the ropes slid across my feet, I knew I was moments away from passing out and there was no way I could keep my legs spread.

Speaker 4:          01:19:11       Just before the end, several brief scenes from my life flashed through my mind. Dolores, my kindergarten sweetheart. Why did she move to California? I saw my dad's new 1949 Chevrolet milk truck with its dark evergreen paint with the white side panels and rich gold leaf letters, my red wagon from Childhood High School Football Games, and to add insult to injury, I saw the front page article in my hometown, part paper about my death. The story was below the fold because stories about local boys dying and nom were now commonplace. That angered me because my family would never know where I really died. On the other hand, I didn't want them to know how I really died. Just as I started to pass out, I felt the ropes slip off my feet. My body went limp. I vaguely remember hitting the elephant grass before landing hard on my back on the ground. I had fallen only or 20 feet. The Ella elephant grass cushion the fall. I hadn't realized that Captain Twang had the aircraft descending during those last frantic moments. Oh yeah. Have those legs spread like a New York City Hooker. Yeah, that's a, that's a nightmare.

Speaker 3:          01:20:32       Yeah. King came and picked me up and threw me in the, in the chopper, left all my gear there, so my car 15 and my sod knife, which now would be a highly treasured item. Still only us [inaudible]. Oh yeah. He just pulled to open a web gear and had to get the thing off my neck. The rucksack, the web gear though just choked me out. He pulled it off and just picked me up and threw me in the helicopter and there I was really happy to feel my head bounce off that metal floor. It hurt, but it a happy hurt.

Speaker 4:          01:21:03       Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Again, if you have to get this book, cause that's, I'm, I'm trying to pick like some good stories, but these are just the kind of ridiculous, uh, things that are going on just another day and a saw just another day in SOG getting hung upside down. 5,000 feet above enemy territory by a d ring. Um, another one here, you guys got some bad weather, you're got no support overhead. That's another thing people need to understand is when you, because of where you guys were located at a pretty good distance away from the bases, if there was no aircraft overhead, then you wouldn't be able to communicate with anyone because they, you'd lose line of sight. Did you guys carry ever Curie, HF radios to try and make long distance?

Speaker 3:          01:21:53       We had VHS for UHF. He had to earn 10 was that, and but um, at nights during the day to Rizza, there was always an airborne command aircraft up. So at the daytime was Hillsboro code. At night it was moonbeam. So they would check in with us on our frequency.

Speaker 4:          01:22:12       So you would, no matter what, you'd have some level of comps. Okay, that's good. So because of the,

Speaker 3:          01:22:18       uh, we knew the NVA, a RDF radio direction finder was really good. There were, there were sharp on that. So when they would check in with us again, if we just

Speaker 4:          01:22:27       click, click [inaudible] no discussion. And for those of you that don't know that, that's direct radio direction finding. So if you sit there and talk on the radio for a long period of time, the enemy can actually capture those, those transmissions. They try and get when they use multiple stations and they can tell what direction they're coming from and they can triangulate where you're at and they can come and get you. So for this particular one, you guys, or the weather's bad, so you don't have any, you don't have any actual direct support overhead. The, the NVA had been chasing, this is the one where you got, you tried to set up an ambush and then they told you don't do it. I know we had to add was set up. We had been at, but then they told you you don't the ambush, right,

Speaker 5:          01:23:06       don't execute it because we were had visions of we get the Po dubby could the nut day if you, we kept a live p o w five day rnr anywhere in the world, a hundred dollars bonus. I was like, man, we're talking about where the and plans, Hawaii or Australia. We hadn't quite decided and as spider came back over and I gave them the cobe, we got appealed. W we'll be back at the primary LZ in one hour and that's what he said. Don't move. But you hadn't initiated, you didn't have the [inaudible] yet. You were waiting. Oh yeah, they're walking up and down to chill. It was just a matter of time before you were going to, well we spring your ambush and this is one of those deals where we violated all the rules of recon. Normally we go 10 and 10 walk, 10 minutes, pause, tend to hear the jungle, let the jungle see how it's gone.

Speaker 5:          01:23:52       Wellness one, because we've had so much trouble trying to get in. They had a slash and burn areas. There were underneath the jungle canopy. I divided the team. We had an eight man team this time before in each side. And I said, we're going to go up this hill until we get to an area, to a trail or whatever. And we didn't stop. We went really hard. Maybe 20, 30, 40 minutes. I forget now. We came up to the big trail, we crossed it one at a time, covered our tracks, got things set up south prep. The wiretap had a perfect damn voice. You know, we had trained, uh, Lynn Black had developed the, uh, the, uh, ambush kill zone so that we'd have clay Morris that would go across, but in a center dubious six foot area that there'd be no shrapnel. But we had, he, he practiced on himself as C four.

Speaker 5:          01:24:46       So he finally figured out at the certain length what a stick a c four was. We in knock yourself out, but he did literally, I know this is another, oh yeah. So anyway, that's our input book. But we had it all set up. So we had the c four to knock out one person, Morris to kill everybody else with sides perimeters and one in the rear just in case he came down to mountain on us and their diddy bopped in up and down a trail. We could, we could have had officers there walking down to trail. Nobody's that upset because we had gone so far, so fast, violating all of our rules that the pupil up to hill didn't know what was going on down the hill. And then spider says don't move. I was like, that's when things got really ugly. And, and when he, what was the reason why he told you guys don't do it because the weather was moving in.

Speaker 5:          01:25:33       Oh yeah. Because we'd only been in the ground two or three hours and whether sock did, he's at 10,000 feet. I can't even see the mountain, let alone CNL z. So he's saying, look, we're not going to be to get you out of there right now. Just don't do whatever you're going to do and, and, and Oh yeah, break contact. Get away. Yeah. So you guys are kind of kind of on the run, you gotta start moving out of there. Right. And so about that time up the hill, we hear the tanks and other trucks starting up their engines and all of a sudden the activity on the goes from casual to frantic. Now everybody's two or three guys, they all got their eks.

Speaker 4:          01:26:08       What do you think clued him in that, that you were there while they heard come in. By then we could hear the dogs. They have some dogs that were deaf back on Elz so they had started looking for us officially. So when you hear dogs, tanks, trucks, and a bunch of people with AK 47

Speaker 5:          01:26:25       yeah. How do you feel about that? Um, the pucker factor is minus zero. It really is. It's like, oh my God.

Speaker 4:          01:26:38       And you know that you've got no form of extraction. Correct. The weird thing is, I guess, and, and having worked in the jungle a little bit, you know, I've, I spent some time in the jungle in South American, that's Southeast Asia. Like I will say this, the jungle is huge, right? Yeah. And you could see where, okay, I can get, I can make myself scarce at least. Oh yeah. Until you remember they got trackers right. And they got dogs,

Speaker 5:          01:27:02       lots of them.

Speaker 4:          01:27:04       So you're in that situation here. Yeah, another Thursday night. But we did get the wiretap though. Sal HUD, Rhonda Rock once for an hour. So once you won, you guys had to take the tape recorder with you though.

Speaker 5:          01:27:15       Oh yeah. We carried the little, um, you know, you think about a traditional early old cassette recorder, so it had like two or four the chip of a Ed d batteries in and then we had the um, microphone that had a little plugging in and then sal would run up the tree or fly up the telephone pole that his case. He had gone up when he came back down and put mud on the whole thing. So anybody going by on a trail looked at the pole, they wouldn't see it. And so we ran it for over an hour. We had run that wire tap and it flipped the cassette over, cause that was state of the art at the time. Your sets.

Speaker 4:          01:27:57       All right. So yes, we want to break this up down. Now you guys are moving, pull back all to clay Morris to see for which direction did you head,

Speaker 5:          01:28:06       um,

Speaker 4:          01:28:06       did you go away from where you inserted or did you go back to where you were?

Speaker 5:          01:28:11       Um, we went, no, we went away from it. Um, if I'm facing Elz we went to our left. Got It. And we went and we had to go way across that big trail again. But this time we had to cross it in between enemy come up and down the truck. It went past us and so took us a while to get back across the big trail. Cause this trail, again, this is layoffs by the way. This is t Minh trail, the Coachee, Montreal spiders that even when he could see the jungle, he couldn't see that road. And the road was big enough. You could drive tanks down in side-by-side. It's huge. It would be the equivalent of a highway 78. Okay. Or 50 to two lanes. So tank side by side, but it's conveniently covered by the covered by the judge vegetation. So it took us a while to get across the road. Then we went to the left, then we finally came

Speaker 3:          01:29:01       to a little stream bed and went up that stream because now it's dark, but now we hear more dogs. The activity on the trail, another couple of trucks go by and all this noise we noted looking at eventually your hold up in your, your you, you stop. Right and an a on a way up that stream we put out pepper. We put out a mace to throw off the dogs, locked the doors and we had our team go up and down these little cars. It was about 10 foot tall bank. We're in this little creek or stream, had water in it and so we was trying to lose the dogs. We knew to come in at night and now it's dark and we contin up that stream for awhile. Call. Wanted to get as far away from them as we could because salad climbed a tree and said their common.

Speaker 3:          01:29:46       He pointed out, he said he told Hep there were hundreds of them coming with lights. They all had lanterns and the dogs were getting closer, sweet canteen up, death's dream for another hour or two at night, doing still going out and putting down a amazed me finest. We're not to the bank on the right, set up our Ron for tonight, rest overnight and I'm facing the bank and the other seven guys are around and so again, we hear the dogs, the people, so we, they're in the rof maybe two or three hours. Two guys come up the the up the stream with a lantern burning brightly. They pass, this lantern goes out and they come back as they come pack hep costs and then they stopped and I think that's where you're going next.

Speaker 1:          01:30:33       Well yeah, that's here. Here it is. One of the NVA and the creek started crawling up the embankment toward me.

Speaker 1:          01:30:40       I was still facing the creek. The NVA soldier was good. He only moved when the wind stirred the trees for a moment. My faults drifted to summer camp in New Hampshire years earlier when we played capture the flag on those clear summer nights. My favorite trick was to use the woods to get as close to the flag as possible. Now, my mind was racing a hundred miles per hour and I realized I was the flag and he was closing in. He was too close for me to tell anyone on my team. The jungle. That night seemed deadly quiet, except of course when the wind stirred as the NVA soldier crawled closer, I remembered thinking that my heart was beating so damn loud that hoe men could hear it in Hanoi. I flashed back to my childhood when we used to play hide and go seek on West Paul Avenue in Trenton, New Jersey. One of my favorite hiding places was behind the hedges and Mr and Mrs Amigos, Front Yard. I remember worrying that Teddy's a Broski or John Wayne Austin or worse Barbara Poynton would find me because they could hear my heart beating so loud. I tried to comfort myself by thinking that because I had not been running in recent hours, my heartbeat shouldn't be too loud. Yet. My heart sounded like a kettle drum during Beethoven's ninth no matter the NVA soldier kept moving up the embankment. I was very impressed with his

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       stealth. I could barely hear him than it happened during one windy moment. I heard movement very close to me. It was only a slight sound, but a sound. Nonetheless, before the wind stopped, the NVA soldier touch the soul of my size. 10 of our army issue, jungle boot. I heard a slight gasp of surprise from him. At that moment. I had a death grip on my car. 15 I had it on single shot a car, 15 on full automatic sound's much different from the bark of an AK 47 on full automatic. If I had to shoot it would be single shots for a millisecond. I wondered if my left foot was far enough to the left so that when I fired it, I wouldn't shoot myself. Time stood still. My pucker factor was minus zero. After a few of the longest seconds of my life, the wind stirred, but there was no movement. He remained still after what seemed like an eternity. The wind stirred again and I heard the NVA moved backwards just slightly. He was so cool. I knew he was facing me. I wondered why I couldn't hear his heart. The jungle around us remained pitch black

Speaker 5:          01:33:13       as my twilight zone moment. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:33:14       yeah, yeah. That's uh, that's, that's craziness. And you think he was, um, you think he just decided like this, this guy's probably got the drop on me and I want to live. What do you think he decided?

Speaker 5:          01:33:29       I believe so because if there had been any other movement at all,

Speaker 4:          01:33:33       okay.

Speaker 5:          01:33:33       Then he would've been on the receiving end of the five, five, six [inaudible]. So he did, he did. He made a tactical decision to live. Yeah. Thank God. Yeah. Cause they know. Then obviously once you started shooting the gay gigs up and you would have been, people would be on your trail clothes and had it happen to me I thought was if I just did one single shop, could the muscle flash would light up where he was and then I was hoping to, would take no more than a second shot to finish him off so that the jungle, they would hear gunshots but they weren't, wouldn't be quite sure

Speaker 4:          01:34:02       where was this? And people that haven't spent time out in the woods or out in the jungle, it can get completely pitch black in the jungle. Is that what this was? Was this just like complete, like he's, you could barely even could you see his face at all? Nothing.

Speaker 5:          01:34:18       I mean he probably knew he was there. You sit there and you could feel your hand in front of your nose when you shake it, move it back and forth. You can feel the breeze from your hand, but you can't see it. Yeah. So for those of you that haven't been in this, it's when you get up at nighttime and then it's a cloudy night and then you're in triple canopy jungle. There is no light, non can't see anything and that's what this situation is.

Speaker 6:          01:34:40       Absolutely.

Speaker 4:          01:34:43       Well luckily you, you got out of that and then you guys continue on going back to the book. By nine o'clock we had located the LZ and secured it. The clear area had several feet of grass on it and the ground was at an angle because it was on the side of mountain. Again,

Speaker 1:          01:34:57       we heard dogs, our tactical scenario stunk. We are in a relatively open area on a hillside with minimal cover and the NBA had the high ground times seem to be our worst enemy. Although having limited air, air resources didn't improve our mood. Finally, the other team was extracted without taking firs further casualties and spider was overhead taking ground fire from the north of the LZ. He told the trustee and reliable marine corps you h one B gunships with the radio call sign. Scarface were seconds away as we heard the chopper's approaching us. One of the toe poppers that Salud Sun had planted, exploded, exploded. So you guys were doing that too. You guys don't set booby traps on them, on the enemy and set claymores on them, right?

Speaker 1:          01:35:46       Which would really piss them off. Oh yeah. Hey, try to ruin their parade. Yeah, we knew the NVA were going to be hopping mad. Now that's a gentle way of putting it. Spider was able to vector the Scarface gun shipped to our location quickly. There was no time for orientations. We popped smoke and seconds later, the first Scarface chopper roared in the jungle north of us, or ruptured with small arms fire. The second Scarface chopper roared in so close it. I could see the facial expressions on the door gunners. He blasted the area north of our LZ with his m 60 machine gun. Both Scarface, both Scarface aircraft took several hits. When the sky Raiders made their passes. They also took hits from small arms fire that sounded like AK 47 during the second gun run, sal blew a claim or in the face of an NVA scout. Sal then flew a second claim. Warn, returned to the LZ reporting more NVA troops right behind him. And you guys, this is another interesting sop. We would do this to carry claymores. I didn't do that. I, Oh, let me rephrase that. We got trained to do this, you know, you know jungle situation, right? You guys would make claymores with like five second and ten second fuses on them, right? Boom. Put 'em down, pull the fuse so you run. Yeah, and run.

Speaker 1:          01:36:59       I never used one of those and I'm very thankful that I did not. Yeah. Uh, yeah. Apparently the combination of air assets and our 40 millimeter barrage has slowed the NVA troops long enough for the extraction ships to come to the LZ. Spider told me that the a hundred first airborne division was going to extract us. The Marine Corps gunships would make one more gun run and for the first time s t Idaho slicks from the a hundred first airborne division would follow right behind them and get as close to the LZ as possible. We were used to the King B's and knew most of the pilots on a first name basis. The a hundred first pilots were good too. But because this was our first time with a a hundred first airborne division slicks, I told Sean King that they had to be the first people to approach the ship and that they had to alert the young door gunners that fought that five of our men were Vietnamese. That's a crazy thing to think about. Oh, absolutely. So you got the head. We had horrible results when they would, when you weren't careful. And again, you know, young

Speaker 5:          01:37:56       door gunners for sure coming to country and if they're not briefed properly, uh, cause our guys dressed irregularly, they had, not that they will look like NVA, but they're, they weren't Americans. We've had team members that lost Vietnamese anyway. Yeah. Tragically

Speaker 1:          01:38:11       we, we, uh, when Roger Hayden was on, he told a story of the same thing he had. They had, they had, uh, Vietnamese scouts and they were doing a hammer and anvil operation with a platoon they hadn't worked with before that was new in country. And there was some mix up puts on the insertion and you know, just some minor mistakes that compounded. And anyways, these guys, the, the Advil portion was waiting and the first guys that came out of the tree line were there Vietnamese scouts. Yeah. And they got, they got lit up. Um, you know, we were in, in, when I was in Ramadi, we, I, you know, you see like pictures of seals with like beards and all that and look at cool like w everyone shaved and everyone, we weren't regular uniforms with what the army and what the Marine Corps war. Why? Because that exact reason, you know, you swing around a corner and you've got a 19 year old on a 50 cal and he sees some guy with a beard and a gun. There's a chance you're getting shot. Whereas an American, you know, cause cause the jihadists would have beards, right. And in Ramadi, we just didn't [inaudible] everything we could do to identify ourselves as good guys did. And

Speaker 5:          01:39:20       do you hottest could have everything from [inaudible] for spar beans to a case you didn't know what they'd be carrying. And they also want least we knew our guys had a case or does.

Speaker 1:          01:39:29       Yeah. Well, the other thing was they were, they wore paramilitary outfits because they wore cammies, they wore body armor sometime. They wore helmets sometimes. So yeah, that's amazing that you guys that and also you had the, you had the Cognizant's to say, Hey, wait a second, we've never worked with these helicopters before. Get out there and tell them we've got some Vietnamese folks coming their way. Right.

Speaker 5:          01:39:52       With AK 40 sevens. Yeah. They were pissed because when king went down for the first chopper, nobody else followed and I said, you make sure you tell them. Then you give me the greenlight devil, a little people. And then Bubba and I got on the second extract and there's two of the things on that mission. Yeah. King had experimental pump, m 79 which she carried. It helped five rounds and we, we thought we'd try it once, but he carried it for five date. Well, the whole five days we were on the ground and so at that LZ it worked and imagine five m 79 rails go off the 40 millimeters. Then also one night was the night that the Russians flew over us. And did a resupply and we were begging for moon beam to show up because somebody on a Russian ass, but the whole side of mountain ended up as a weirdest damn thing we ever saw.

Speaker 1:          01:40:40       So that was like a signaling device for it. That was signaling devices that the, that the Vietnamese were using to have the Russians drop the resupply in there. They were

Speaker 5:          01:40:49       doing resupplies to the Vietnamese. What language did you speak? Uh, my foreign language is English. So they pushed this through and they weighed the way the language required because by 68, they knew we had SF had a strong interpreter corps. Got It. Like Ma, like Hap, he spoke four languages. He had been educated in France and he cracked up my English and he was a smart ass on top of it. A little fucker.

Speaker 4:          01:41:18       But he was already a little guy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Awesome. Uh, going back to the book, the extraction was slick and quick win. Um, as we pulled out of the automatic l, as we pulled out of the LZ, the slick took several hits. Three of us returned full automatic fire from our car. Fifteens I threw a white phosphorus grenade as the area north of the LZ, lit up with dozens of muzzle flashes from AK 47 and [inaudible]. The green traces from the AK 47 is appeared as though they were coming between my legs. I was told later that as our slick pulled out of the LZ, the iscar phase gunships laid down a full fuselage fuselage of, of suppressing fire. The lead marine aircraft piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Robinson, had the plexiglass windshield blown out of the aircraft. In addition, his chopper and the second gunship had taken more than a dozen hits. And yeah, that's, that's, that's, that's the uh, colonel that you were saying, yes, he was riding you and riding you. And by the way, you tell it the book, colonel, does this mean the next time we're in trouble, we call for Scarface. You won't respond to the bell. Hell No. Robinson responded. I never said that. It just pisses me off when my aircraft gets shot up. Parts are hard to come by and I'd rather be flying

Speaker 5:          01:42:36       fearless. And

Speaker 4:          01:42:39       you know you continue on here. I went back to my room, so this is after that crazy operation. You barely make it out for the hundredth time that you've you, you dance in death's face. I went back to my room and picked up a news magazine with a picture on the front page about the biggest latest anti war protests, state side, insane. Who side were they on? They hadn't seen Charlie like s t Idaho had they never, they never asked Sao hip and other Vietnamese men on my team what they felt about the war. What a day as three refuse to pull us out when we were ready for extraction. Then as three question my integrity, despite the fact that we were only minutes away from fighting NVA in close quarters battle had not Scarface. The [inaudible] and the a hundred first airborne slicks defended us from the sky and there are people back in the states protesting this war. I shook my head, dropped my rucksack and web gear, picked up a small ammo belt, holding several magazines of five, five, six ammo and went to the s three to get a jeep. The dentist was only a short drive up the road, but I kept my trusty car 15 nearby. Anyway, I went to the dentist, got my tooth pulled and drew knew and PRC 25 batteries.

Speaker 6:          01:43:54       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:43:54       And th the reason I read all that is to read this line right here. The next day, the next day s D Idaho got shot out of five LZs

Speaker 5:          01:44:04       yeah, once in the morning and once in the afternoon.

Speaker 5:          01:44:08       And by that time when we got inserted on that Missionar uh, we had gone a couple of days, the same thing in the morning gets shot out. And on one of those missions on the primary L Z, when a King p was going in south, saw a wire across the LZ. Now how does sal even see a wire in a helicopter? When we're going in? He saw it. He told the door gunner. Fortunately, the Vietnamese thing was quick and they were able to swerve away and a one came in and hit that with a 500 pound bomb. They knew we were coming and we had been compromised. We never realized how seriously we'd been compromised and that was proof, hard proof and where our guys are. So Tara switched a lot of Vietnamese around [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          01:45:01       you, so your, your guys were, some of your Vietnamese were getting burned out. Oh sure.

Speaker 5:          01:45:05       Cause you know you, you do that long flight, go out through the LG, then you go in and get shot out, shot out, shot out, fly back, get lunch, get a new target. Sometimes they just say, here's your next target cubby would know where it would be. We wouldn't even have any kind of background or anything on it. Just they wanted to get a team on the ground, go back and then we did it again. Bam, Bam, Bam.

Speaker 4:          01:45:29       And sometimes we u n so you're Vietnamese sometimes say, all right, I've had enough of the school. Is your main, who is your main outlet guy? South by counterpart. He was the assistant team leader. He is the Vietnamese team leader. And who was the other American that would be with you? Uh, at that point in time was Bubba John's shore. He came on the team in a November where I became to one zero at the end of October. And these guys were all freaked out too. Cause you were like young. Oh yeah. And what were you, uh, what was your rank at that time? Well, by then I'd been promoted to e four cause I remember on that promoted, yeah, he deuce in camp with the built for e eight or a nine on a recon team. So spider probably got me promoted back to PFC said, now roll up your sleeves so people think you're a sergeant. We don't want the, no, you're just a dumb ass PFC instead of by October

Speaker 5:          01:46:20       we able to add a Spec for, and then, uh, when Jim wanted off the team, which we respected. And to this day I respected it. Never, I'll never say a word against them on that. Um, then Bubba came on. So in November, that's when Babou uh, he was the a one one. And then on that one mission king came along. I just felt funny about I want a little extra firepower and he wanted to try that. Uh, that pump and 79 yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:46:46       Why not just going off on a mission to test that then? Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:46:52       we had that a, they sent us some thermobaric grenades for the m 79. Oh really? Yeah. And, and then they called a week later and said, hey, did you guys get a Cha? It was actually leaf, I think life dumped it up like an entire load out of them on one operation. And anyways, they, they call back, they say, hey, did you guys, we're wondering if you get a chance to use those. They're motto Thera Boma grenade yet. Like where we use the mall, send more, here's the feedback. Do not wait.

Speaker 5:          01:47:24       Well, yeah. And also as it, speaking of that, as, as one of our side missions, we always carried eldest son or Italian green, which would be enemy ordinance. Dr Took slowed in her face. So when we would go along a trail like wood, that pictorial, we crossed it. We'd go down and dump a little the Ammo, so if anybody was CDMO, they'd pick it up and then if we ever came across cache, which only happened a few times, we would put the bad ammo in their cache, so they use it for psyops. Then it would blow up on her face. I was a good psyops thing when they were, there was, there was another mission where you talk about where they'd killed the Americans, but they let the, Oh, you have the Vietnamese girl that was there January 1st 69

Speaker 1:          01:48:11       all right. Speaking of holiday season, here's Christmas Day 1968 you're inserted into like some really tall elephant grass. There's NVA around you. Going back to the book due to the elephant grass, both in terms of the noise we were making and how muffled, how it muffled our other sounds, we couldn't tell exactly how many NVA were moving or if they were, even NVA black said, I smell smoke. Either our hand grenades or the NVA has started fires.

Speaker 6:          01:48:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:48:41       Things are really heating up on the LZ. Literally, I radioed spider. I told them we were surrounded and had fires on two sides of our perimeter. I told him that if the king bees didn't get in here asap, s t Idaho would be engaged in fighting fires as well as fire fights.

Speaker 1:          01:49:01       Were you really making these punny jokes in the middle of these situations? Sometimes you have to laugh to keep from crying. Uh, they're starting more fires. Bubba said by now the noise from the fire forces to raise our voices. When we were talking to each other, the smoke was getting thicker. I began to sweat. We threw a few more hand-grenades down the hill to force the NVA to keep their heads down the southern fire. So just so everyone understands, this is what's actually happening. You're in elephant grass, dry elephant grass, and it's burning on multiple sides of your position,

Speaker 5:          01:49:33       which is 12 to 15 feet tall. The elephant grass. So your visibility is like five feet. Three feet. Yeah. Minimal. And it's filled with smoke. Yeah. And getting worse. However we wish

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       you a merry Christmas. Yeah. The southern fire's intensity grew by the second and continued to move up the slope towards us and around to the east. There was fire or fires to the north and northeast, but they weren't heading toward Estee, Idaho with the speed of the southern flames. By now, the smoke was so thick, I had my green cravat over my face and pulled up over my nose, burning embers from the south, kicked up and flew over our small jaggedy perimeter, dumping ashes sot and small burning sparks on the elephant grass and on us only hip and Twan wore hats. Several of US soaked our hair. Black told me that the NVA weren't far behind the flames to wanted report and seeing images of short distance behind the flames to the south and southeast. Captain Twang knew exactly where we were. As he brought the age 34 down the canyon toward us.

Speaker 1:          01:50:40       Seconds became ours. My vision was clearer than ever and I was a co cutely aware of the smoke, fire popping sounds and enemy gunfire. I stood on the western edge of the perimeter waving a colored panel skyward, trying to catch the pilots. I, the age 34 continued its slow motion descent. All I saw was the bottom of the chopper with the front of the strut sticking out to the right and left coming down like a giant praying mantis. The rotor wash, when the king bee began to hit us. Finally the chopper's nose turned slightly to the left and I could see captain twang seeing his face, seeing him sitting in there. So commonly in the pilot seat made my confidence surge. We would survive. And then you guys, you guys, you know, get, get around, get it under control. Well under control as you can and you start boarding the tropper chopper as the last man board of the chopper, I signal to the door gunner to exit the area. As I sat in the door, I sat in the doors, Twang lifted the king be straight up for several feet before heading south. As we pulled away from the knoll fire, swept up the hill and Gulf. The area where we had been standing moments earlier.

Speaker 2:          01:51:48       Oh yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:51:50       Every Christmas I, Paula's Captain Twang roared down the canyon. We had chugged only a short while ago. I radioed spider and gave him a team. Okay. Once again, s t Idaho entered that magical post-mission moment. The adrenaline was still flowing. We had survived another target. Every breath of air was sweeter.

Speaker 2:          01:52:17       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:52:17       There was no thought of Christmas mom or holiday presence. Our gift was to be alive that Christmas 1968 would haunt me sporadically for more than 25 years. After a while, I was able to stop sitting upright, sweating with fear when the nightmares hit. It's been almost 10 years since I had that dream. But every Christmas nightmares are not. I always

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       take a moment to think of captain twangs courage. No sweat can bs. Never rest. Yeah. So that was, uh, this is, that's, that's just a crazy situation. Oh yeah. Close. And then this is like on Thanksgiving was when we had the mission down south where our six mayor recon team, the credal tells us you have to find three missing NBA divisions to first the third and the seventh. We found them. How'd that work out for you? Uh, it was pretty intense. We use, we use more than one of those five second fuses as the holding back. Yeah. Yeah. Just that again, that's, that's why you need to buy this book and read this book. If you want to hear about the eight man spike team versus a division on that day was three, three divisions. For those of you that don't academy this, that's 30 30,000 men roughly.

Speaker 4:          01:53:46       And yeah, that's where those, those um, five second few of those five second fuses. Just so everybody understands what that means. You're trying to escape the enemy. You have a little thing called the claymore mine. It's like the size of a book, maybe a little bit bigger and it's got a bunch of ball-bearings on one side, the 500 5,550 ball-bearings on one side that are, that spray out when, when this thing explodes. And those are so like wound people. How many of those things did you guys carry? Um, every, everybody had one on a team and then the one one or least carry two or three. So you guys had lawless C4 yeah, at least. And so what these guys would do, so you can use them for a bunch of different reasons. And one of the, one of the things that you guys did a lot with them, and this is again, these are things that I was trained in when I was first got the seal teams aid too.

Speaker 4:          01:54:38       Okay. When you set up a, when you're going to sleep at night or you're going to set up a a rest overnight position, you're going to put out claymores. And that way if you get attacked in the middle of the night, boom, you can light off the claymores and you a can get some fire superiority or at least shocked the enemy or do some damage to them. So you guys did that all the time, but then you made these little five-second fuses knowing that if you're running away, you can just put this thing up, you know, put it in the ground real quick or put it up against the tree pull. Yeah. You always want to have it up against the tree or something to take the back, pull it back. Even when you put it in and you've got the last four seconds before it explodes, you're running. You could still, you want to make sure that you got a little protected on the black blast. We used to detonate those things that are completely unsafe distance behind him. I like, I look back now and I'm thinking, what were we doing? WTF Times two. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, it's like we play the game. Let's find out. Are you relate the limb blocks. So now on this thing. Yeah. Yeah. So you started to tell that story a little bit. For those of you who didn't catch the whole story, the story Lynn Black

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       was trying to figure out what it would take to knock somebody out with [inaudible]. So see for as six feet. Yeah. C Four just explodes. There's no shrapnel in it. You can put shrapnel in it, but you don't have to. So it's just, it's just a big concussion. So Lynn Black was trying to figure out how much c four it would take so we can stun a guy so we can grab them so we can get a pow. So that we can get a five day liberty anywhere in the world, anywhere and $100 cash. And so he figured, so the way he, the way he experimented with this was by doing it to himself. Yeah. Just standing around at the range and blastic himself with heavier and heavier weight until he got knocked out. And when he finally succeeded, he, uh, his hearing was bad for a few days.

Speaker 1:          01:56:27       Yeah. His hair was all. So, you know, I try this with the, I don't know if this in the seal teams, that would've been weird to use the new guy for that we would use the new guy like, okay, let's see if this works. I'll do, let's when the s when the a stun guns, the tasers first came in, it wasn't fun to be a new guy because we had to see how those things work. Right. So we, uh, we used to experiment with that. So, um, yeah, those, that story is just crazy. And you and you looking down and seeing the firing Gulf, the place that you just got picked.

Speaker 5:          01:56:59       Oh yeah. Instantly. Sure. Is this like one of those moments in time? It's the same thing. Like on Thanksgiving Day, we got distracted. Deer were coming out of the jungle running at port arms and so they would be tried to come down. So me in the door gunner, which is Lily's stopped him in to try like one. Those cartoons you see on the TV you would have guys running and stops. He gets Janke. They would just push them right back in the jungle before he even fell down. And that was just, um, yeah, you just, you don't forget those things. They stick with you.

Speaker 1:          01:57:33       The next chapter is called a happy new year. Oh hmm. Uh, the day after Christmas, the s three brass asked s t Idaho to run another m a target and Laos, I respectfully declined citing fatigue and general weariness. I didn't tell the brass that I had a funny feeling about the target. I felt apprehensive for some reason.

Speaker 2:          01:57:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:57:56       Back at fob one around 1200 hours. Someone from the Camo shack came into the club instead of Vietnamese team member from our t ASP was on the radio talking to spider. That was very bad news. Several of the RECON team members in fob one headed toward the Camo shack. Before we got there, Tony Harrell, a veteran recon man came around the corner with some more bad news. They were hit by sappers. It doesn't look good.

Speaker 2:          01:58:23       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:58:23       it appeared the American's and bid slow to react in a matter of seconds. The sappers killed the three SF troops and chose to leave the south Vietnamese team members alive. The news about the sappers was a triple dose of bad news. First we had three dead green berets.

Speaker 2:          01:58:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       Second reports. One Zeros had received from months about NVA sappers being a leaf lethal force. We're now confirmed.

Speaker 2:          01:58:51       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:58:51       Third, by killing only the Americans. The NVA pulled off a major psychological coup by leaving the envy that by leaving the Vietnamese team members alive, their survival would plant seeds of doubt and dissension between SF troops and our little pieces.

Speaker 2:          01:59:08       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:59:15       and then you guys were heading north the hundred first airborne division. Choppers carried the six men south when the choppers landed on the helicopter pad. Colonel Jack Warren had ordered every man in fob for out to the site.

Speaker 2:          01:59:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:59:29       He was held in high regard by SF troops because he genuinely cared about his men

Speaker 2:          01:59:35       [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          01:59:35       It had been said that because of his dedication to the SF mission and the men of SF, he would never advance beyond the rank of colonel. He'd remained an SF too long, a career decision, not the traditional army hierarchy, despised and punished. ASP was from farb for Fob, for which Warren commanded. After the three corpses were unloaded from the helicopter, Warren gave a terse teary-eyed speech to his captive audience.

Speaker 2:          02:00:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:00:06       Warren warned everyone that if they were careless in the field, death was the result of that carelessness.

Speaker 2:          02:00:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:00:13       Then he bent down, opened the body bag, and picked up a portion of a body of one of the dead Americans. He was now crying and screaming at his men to never be careless in the field. Warren was never the same after that.

Speaker 2:          02:00:31       Okay?

Speaker 1:          02:00:32       Neither was CNC. What, what was it that changed from your perspective?

Speaker 5:          02:00:42       Well, we, um, from our early briefings, probably in October, we heard about the NBA soccer teams. They were highly trained and, um, they would just wear a loin cloth, carry a weapon. And, uh, they were really just highly trained and tracking so that when they came to the TAC part, they have minimal clothing and they knew what they were looking for. And the NBA at that point had a metal kill American metal. So they killed us. They got their metal and a bonus and there would be heroes for the rest of their lives within the communist party. So we heard about them disconfirmed it and it just kicked up everybody's concerned a notch. And that being New Year's Eve, the team had at the Americas had taken a bottle of Scotch with them. So they had had little hit of the Scotch. We don't know how much and that's what Jack Warren had gone the extra distance on saying about being careless. We don't know. But the sappers were good and um, that proved it. And it just gave us an our case no on, as you know for you, do you Ron at night without the dogs he would do your perimeter. And our people always checked me and we always had rotated whose be sleeping and who wouldn't. And we never ever had a problem with that. No matter how tired you are to be somebody awake just so something like that happened. Somebody be there on full automatic ready, the respond

Speaker 1:          02:02:19       new level terror. Yeah. And those guys were so it's like a just traveling super light and super select the sappers sure. You know, just could move quickly and yeah. That's a scary uh,

Speaker 5:          02:02:31       yeah, because you know, the, we knew that the NBA had all our sources set up meeting besides being compromised in headquarters. They also had people that alerted when the choppers left along site. They have border watchers so that when we came in they would report where we were heading to a higher command and they would try to rally their troops. So we were up against that at all times. Just a question of who would be there, how many, and a lot of times just getting on the ground was the first part, but then you hope to get into the mission and it was just really a challenge.

Speaker 2:          02:03:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:03:13       Speaking of a challenge who were going back to the book, the daily grind of running missions across the fence was wearing on me physically and mentally. As 69 dawned, I began a mental examination of life in SOG. Being in an elite unit within America's finest special operations was where I wanted to be. The adrenaline enhanced high of deadly fire fights against a relentless m enemy under extremely lopsided odds was intoxicating. I had never experienced such exhilaration or sheer terror if there was a little voice in the back of my head, which spoke of survival, surviving not only a vigorous enemy campaign directed against a SOG members, but merely surviving the odds of going home in one piece. My mind also began the mental debate between rising to the new challenges inherent in a secret war and returning to a safer assignment.

Speaker 2:          02:04:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:04:15       My one year tour of duty was scheduled to end at the end of April. Under the general rules of SOG after running targets across the fence for six months, I could request a cushy assignment. I had already spent seven months with the team. I was alive. However, thanks to hip sow fuck Twan and the other men STI though. I couldn't just walk away. And that's where your, that's where you wrap up this book. Now you go into some cool. Um, you go into some cool, one more really interesting story. And then you also have a very cool thing in there about what you guys carried and what we didn't care and what you didn't carry. How much, so how much longer? So now it's January of 69. Yeah, you'd been there for seven months. How much longer did you stay with the CNC teams?

Speaker 5:          02:05:12       I'll stay right there to the end. Um, we, we closed fob one in January. They shipped us down to Denang and that's where I picked up with a second book. And uh, um, they needed help down here. So we hit the ground, um, continue to run. Baba asked if tape be taken off the team. So he left. Lynn black came on. So with linen on for my last couple of months and at the very end they had a mission up at the mew pass, which was north of the DMZ river in layoffs, which was a major channel point. And the plan was for us to go in, set up our mountain top, taking a lot of claymores mortars and um, call an airstrikes for two or three days on that just to raise hell with the NBA there cause they never had a recon team go that far north.

Speaker 5:          02:06:09       And we did an inspection, which is that inspection prior to that mission, which was about April 20th, 69. And then, um, we finally went up to the launch site and we were up to, I guess maybe about the 24th or 25th. I just forget the exact date now, but we were up to a launch site, got on the choppers, we're getting ready to launch, the choppers take off. And he turned around, went back, and he hit that target had just had two aircraft shot down over it and they figured they just shot down a phantom jet and the sky reader choppers are going to be easy to knock out this guy. So to Sidebar to that, I'm at a reunion two years ago, one of the guys that ran recon says, remember those pictures? You got an f on your second book on the Ground Air? I said, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:07:00       He says, what was their mission? Wasn't that something like that? A suicide mission, right. And says, well I don't know about suicide. I was going to be high odds. But you know, we were gone and we had two extra Americans where we had [inaudible]. We got Buku bullets. Hand-Grenades we were gonna give it a shot. This guy goes, do you realize they asked me to do that and I told him to fuck off. I go, really? [inaudible] you saw taking pressure. You didn't tell me that cause I didn't know what your mission was. So here's the top secret operation, the recon guys, another man, it'd be given that target said Hell No, it was too far north and you've just felt that the, uh, it would just be a suicide mission. And once you get in, you never get out other than a casket or a body bag. But there's no talking between teams much cause everything is like you got a mission, you do your mission, they do theirs. So

Speaker 1:          02:07:55       yeah. Well, uh, I already gave you a fair warning before we started this that we're probably gonna have to have you come back on here. Cause I mean, I, I got just a, I mean this, this, these books are, they're just awesome. The detail that you go on to and just the experience that you've had, which are just, it's a miracle that you're sitting here talking and able to tell us what you went through when, as far as I can tell, there's no way in hell you should be sitting here right now. I agree

Speaker 5:          02:08:27       times when, uh, in talking to friends who are people that have read the book, you know, particularly on page two oh two would the guy touches your boots. I mean, I've talked to people. It's just like, it feels surreal even today. It's like, thank God everybody at home was praying, you know? And uh, yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:08:46       The last thing I want to read from the book is just a, just this section right here. The dedication says this book is dedicated to all SOC reconnaissance team members, both US special forces and indigenous troops as well as to every man in every air support unit, especially the king B pilots of the 219 south Vietnamese air forces, Special Operations Squadron who worked daily with SOG teams on the ground across the fence in America's secret war.

Speaker 5:          02:09:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:09:18       This book is also for every man in SOG and their support units. Who made the ultimate sacrifice.

Speaker 5:          02:09:30       Yeah. Because today as we sit here, there are still 1,589 Americans missing in action in Southeast Asia from the Vietnam War. That includes CIA, s f regular army and lay us alone. 50 Green Berets are amongst those mias over 140 aviation, army, Marine Corps, Air Force, Mias dies supporting our missions ear just held deleo was,

Speaker 1:          02:09:59       you guys had a over 100% casualty rate.

Speaker 5:          02:10:03       Yeah. Several of our guys have multiple purple hearts. Bob Howard received eight. He had been put in for 11. He, he, he was a recipient of the medal of honor in December 68 for a mission out of Kontomble. And uh, yeah, the Cassie rate did a seat a hundred percent.

Speaker 1:          02:10:20       The uh, and I, I didn't, I couldn't find any numbers on the numbers that were actually killed, but that was a massive number percentage wise of guys in SOG that were

Speaker 5:          02:10:31       killed. Right. Yeah. The numbers, um, are hard to track. Um, I'm working with a gal now who's a real, she's a retired master sergeant from the a hundred first and she's begin to do some research to, to try to put that number together because during a war, 3.2 million Americans served in Vietnam. That includes the 500,000 sailors there off off the coast and your seals that were going up north. And um, out of that 20,000, approximately 20,000 were SF out of the SF prostate. 2000 went to SOG out of that. Depends on which author you talk to. There's no hard stats anywhere because SF was not as good as the seals and keep our records and uh, it'd be between 500 to seven, maybe 800 green berets actually went across the fence with recon missions out of the 3.2 million. Those are our numbers.

Speaker 4:          02:11:32       Yeah. Amazing. Um, well I hope you don't mind coming back here and an honor to come back because for some of your stories, pal, do believe me, my stories are on a big joke. I, I conversed with, uh, one of our, one of the guys that was in Ramadi with me, a guy by the name of Dave Burke. He was, he was a Marine Corps ANGLICO guy on the ground with us. And you know, we always joke our about our, about what are our experiences, you know, he had a friend and we had him on the podcast who served in World War II, Korea and Vietnam. Really, he was a purple heart recipient in every war and every one of those wars I had, you know, uh, that's the way I feel standing here talking to you. Like I'm, I'm uh, in a totally different and much lower category of experience. But that's why it's such an honor to sit here and talk with you about this mutual. If you have any other closing thoughts too.

Speaker 5:          02:12:25       Well, the only thing about this book actually spot the mentioned that I could've done it without my wife. Awesome. My dear wife Anna at the time, um, we had four teenagers in one newborn in the house and said, you can imagine that turmoil and I'm working that fish wrapper up in north county and so between the fish wrapper and the kids, she goes, go right to book.

Speaker 4:          02:12:49       Awesome. She supported me all it. That is one thing real quick. When you got home from, so you got out shortly thereafter when you got done with Vietnam is that that's when you were done, right? You got out of the army shortly thereafter?

Speaker 5:          02:12:59       Yeah, I went back to, to CNC, a for second tour and then I got out of the army in April 20 fives with book to Isabelle. Going back

Speaker 4:          02:13:08       one tour wasn't enough at CMC.

Speaker 5:          02:13:10       Well you know what, it be all honest with you. I came back in, uh, by the time I landed in the states like may one, May 2nd of 69, the antiwar movements going on strong. Uh, there was Woodstock, our men walked on the moon, but I hated, hated being and we were and are supposed to go to, to Fort Bragg with the regular SF. But the 10th Special Forces group was up in Massachusetts and they had five companies, a, B, c, d, and e. He was a signal company, which was rinky dink. They had new lieutenants, butter bars running this thing and they treat it like basic camp on us up. And to top it off, they had old career sergeants that are all overweight on embarrassment to the Bra they wore. And they came in and put me up batoon sergeant and I'm, I'm in this environment that was not a good chemistry.

Speaker 5:          02:14:02       So, um, I heard that the MPS were coming basically. And uh, I went down to Pentagon. We had a woman, Billy Alexander, who handled our orders as told what kind of wine and what flower she likes. So before I went down here, I had her wine, her flowers, and a Thursday morning I get to the Pentagon is seven o'clock, give her the flowers, no wine, went back to sleep in a parking lot, came back and forth. She gave me two orders to nom. I cleared on Friday, the MPS came on Monday and I was back in my team.

Speaker 4:          02:14:33       40 MPs covered for what are some bar fights? Property destruction. They have reports of a four 42, which I had at a time for four to w 30 which is what? Austin Oldsmobile [inaudible]. Oh God, God. Oh, that for four to go y'all, sorry. Yeah, it's a 69 which was the coolest car at the time. You hear me too? For sure. There are reports about that car going through the entrance gate on the sideways drift. I said, I'm sorry. When I entered the base on the exit gate, that's what it was. The MP's weren't happy about that. They couldn't catch me. I was able to hide within our conquest mint, but they were trying to begin to figure things out. But anyways, they were common. Sounds like, or it sounds like the next podcast, that's the warm up for the next podcast. We'll, we'll take it from there next time. Like a bad dream. I'll be back if you ask. Thank you.

And thank you, really a true honor to have you on. Appreciate it. Honor to be here. And can we have you back if you turn outstanding. Thank you. And with that, Mr John Stryker Meyer has left the building and what an honor it was to talk to him and I can absolutely promise we're having that guy back on. And thanks to you, John, for your, for your service and your sacrifice and the sacrifices of your teammates. It is men like you that have allowed us to live the way that we live in that is in freedom. So he has left the building and echo. Um, speaking of living, living the way we should live, what do you got for us? Well as we have been doing, talking about Jujitsu first [inaudible] Jujitsu, martial arts, uh, know

Speaker 7:          02:17:46       capability is what it is. That's really what it is. You want to generalize it like the whole thing into one big nugget capability. Just improve the capability. We want to improve our capabilities. Oh yeah, sure. Way Too.

Speaker 4:          02:17:57       Do that. Not just in the Marshall fields but in life. Yeah. Is to train some of that Jujitsu.

Speaker 7:          02:18:04       Yeah, I was talking to, there's a girl named Kara who trains here, you know, I see her every once in a while I'll see or whatever. And um, she, she said basically the stuff we were saying where she was like, I was like, I bet I only see her sort of in the men's class. I said, hey, have you tried the women's costs that are women's class goodness developed? And then she was like, not yet. I want to whatever. And I was like, yeah, that's, I think a lot of the times we'll, we'll offer more benefits depending on who you are as a girl, we'll offer benefits because you can get like the moves you can kind of do, you know on on a body that's more similar to yours. So you can go through the moves a little bit more thoroughly. I think in a way for lack of better way of putting it.

Speaker 7:          02:18:48       She was like, yeah, that's good. That's true. She's like, you know what though, I really like, there's a lot of value here in, in the guys in the men's class. And she said straight for self defense for sure. And I was like, yeah. She's like, yeah because like when you get used to guys and meanwhile there's like two guys scrolling like hard though, you know the kind where they're rolling and they're grunting at right in front of us like sweating and split their splits with flashing on us. And she's like, when you get with [inaudible] and we kind of laugh cause w she like motions to them and I'm thinking like, yeah, any girl to come in and see that or anyone even anyone even never dissipate in that. Yeah. Thinking I got to do that. No way man. I'm not ready for that. All girls are not ready for that.

Speaker 7:          02:19:26       Oh yeah. And what if you would just all of a sudden like one day you go to the grocery store and now you've got to deal with that. Man. That's, that's tough cause it's a big psychological gap. You need to make up. Oh you have to train Jujitsu. The gap is made up. She was like, I'm used to and she's not a big girl either. She's just like a pretty small girl. She's like, yeah and he's real nice, you know, nice to go. She's like, yeah, I'm cool. And I'm really used to that and I've been training for like almost a year now. I'm like a big difference. That's good that you can come in here as often as you do and have that mindset. That's good. That's going to get you places 100% so we're talking about Jujitsu. Oh yeah. And then you need to start talking about the gear that is needed for Jujitsu.

Speaker 7:          02:20:06       Some of it, yes. Some of the gear that you need for to do as a g. Yes. If you're going to train g Jujitsu, which we recommend strongly, strongly recommend. We also recommend you train No-gi. You train all kinds of Jujitsu. Yeah, that's what you train. If you need a g, which you do get one from origin, main origin, so you go to origin, maine.com this is where you can get all these things. Also jeans, American Denim. Again, we all, we all know this, but I'm going to say it again. It's all made in America. All of it. Yup. Every little piece of it. The little seeds that they plant to eventually grow cotton to eventually go into the loon to eventually formulate. We've yes, formulate both the fabric that gets sewn and stitched into ghees jeans, rash guards, all this stuff. Shorts, the shorts in oral tube, by the way, factually.

Speaker 7:          02:20:59       Anyway, all of it is in American done in America. So boom, there's that huge deal by the way. So yeah, American Denim hasn't, we have some new jeans, good ones, jogger, you know, sweat pants, sweat, athletic gear, boom, origin, Maine, their supplements, big deal. Pretty much all the essential supplements that you're going to need as you go through this kind of hectic path at times about the sector and should be, yeah, I kind of cheesy. That's not the path we want to be on. That path leads down. It's going to be easy if it's a downhill situation cause all you gotta do is sit there and slide, don't take the path down, you know? So yes, the supplements are joint warfare for your joints. Joint warfare is more for like if you have get abuse on your joints, you're running a lot. You, you're doing jujitsu where you're twisting a lot and you're going every day or something like this or you're just lifting every day lifting everyday.

Speaker 7:          02:21:56       Oh yeah. Basically if you're doing physical activity. Yeah, that's Kinda like hard. I mean, I guess you could break it down like, Oh, if you're doing some weak physical activity then you might not need it. But I think not that so much the joint where for you made a good point though, the muster number. Cause your knee is like Kinda on the panel on the final Steven's healing and you were like, I was like, yeah, how's your knee or whatever and you're like, uh, would you say, oh it was good. But like, oh, since I've been standing up on it for a long yeah, sure. Yeah. At the muster, yes. It actually swelled up again. Yes, surprisingly. So. Here's the thing, it made me think when I was a bouncer, I used to stand up all the time. Like for the whole thing, you're standing at the front door and not the tactics, the path, the second and the struggle is real bad. And, but I have dress shoes on. I don't have the, the new balance or the, you know, the deal, it's like dress shoes. So it's like it was hurting man. Joint warfare have came in handy. Well, you know, varying levels of hard to get some joint warfare for your joints. Get some Krill oil for your joints. General Maintenance and general maintenance of life. Yes. Life support. Yes. Let me get the, and then discipline and discipline go, which is sort of like, um, gives you a little bit of that.

Speaker 7:          02:23:15       Yeah. A little edge. Mentally Shotgun. It is illegal. Negative. If you are going to confront someone in an intellectual battle, is it legal for you to take discipline? Go and they don't, should not be illegal because it's not any legal drug shit. It's not even drugs. It's actually good advantage though, right? Yeah. Good. We lifting weights is an advantage or the results from lifting weights is an advantage of the results from eating salads. That's an advantage. So boom, same thing. But just the pulling just tastes really good and uh, and have that advantage over your enemy, whoever they may be. Yes. Then we got up, we also got milk, which is milk, delicious, delicious protein. And I had a milkshake last night at meatloaf. No potatoes. Meatloaf, carrots. Milkshake. That's a good meal right there. Chocolate, dark. Know the darkness and I put peanut butter in it. Boom. There it is. Literally my late dinner last night, I was 10. Yeah. That's the milk. And you can give it to your kids too. You can get the warrior kid milk. Yeah. For your kids. So your kids, so your kids instead of turning out to be like an obese outage shape kid that you were like trying to, no, don't even put them on that path. Put 'em on the milk tray. Let me ask you this, when you were young, yes. And you went to whatever, elementary school, junior high, whatever. Did you bring home lunch?

Speaker 7:          02:24:52       Sometimes. Yeah. So not very often. Okay. So do you [inaudible] as far as you can remember, did you, did you have a healthy home lunch? Do you, was your, you know, nothing and we didn't even know what healthy was. Like it wasn't, that wasn't even a thing. Yeah. They were just like, oh what do you like to eat peanut and what do you like to eat and what's cheap? Yes. Right. Cause we're going to get you, we're not getting you cold cuts. Right. Cause those costs money. Guess what? Doesn't cost a lot of money. Bologna jam.

Speaker 7:          02:25:22       PB and jam. Yeah. Right. [inaudible] butter and Jelly. Oh, two all day long on the on on white bread. Oh, white bread, white bread. And then you know what? You get the little, the little party mix of of potato chips. Frito lays Doritos, which I never liked Oreos. I still don't like to read those interests. Yeah, but then you get some of that and then like some chocolate chips. I'm chips Ahoy cookies. You know what those are? Yes. I do get the sleet, little little mini sleeve, a chips Ahoy and so there's nothing nutritional. Right. There's the nutritional value of this launch is zero. You had nothing. Yeah. If that was best case scenario, I used to get the chocolate milk from the cost that it costs 5 cents for a chocolate for a white milk, 7 cents for a chocolate milk. Oh, at my school school lunch. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          02:26:13       So I used to get that. That would probably be when I actually lived off of, because everything else was just was just poisoned in a rapper basically. Yeah. Does that answer your question? Well, I mean the reason I was asking is because, okay, so my family or my mom more than my dad I guess. But you know, my mom took care of the poem lunches in the event of us bringing her home lunch. She, she's health conscious. She was like a Hippie, you know, so we had like the whole wheat bread. Okay. You know, and then Novato, you're, how old are you? I will be 42 this year. So you're like five years younger than me. There's a, there's a difference there in terms of what people were even thinking. Yeah. Yeah. We'll keep in mind everyone wasn't like that. I'm saying my mom was, my mom was like a hippie.

Speaker 7:          02:26:57       She was different than everyone. And here's what, here's my point with that. Where when we'd come to school and I'd bring home lunch, we'd get sorta teased because it's like you don't get the cool snacks, the cool Frito lay, Frito Lay's and chips and cookies in like the cool fun stuff. Oh No. And then open the milk negative. No, you got, we got the whole wheat sandwich with like Turkey from a real Turkey with sprouted grains on it or some little wheat bread hundred. Sorry about that. Sprouted grain. That's the next level right there it is. It is. Nonetheless. We got laughed at that end. Mama Deco was coming in hard with the sprouted oil rain bread with a health. Yeah and there was making funny cause it tastes like cardboard. I don't even know cause they don't know how it tastes. It's not tight. It's more of a social thing.

Speaker 7:          02:27:42       Everyone, everyone knows that cookies or young yummy. Everyone knows that like chips are delicious for snack and all this stuff. We didn't have that. We had like the snacks that they knew that weren't that good tasting carrots and like carrots are pretty tasty though. I think so now. Yes, concerned about cares. If you're not eating sugar and you eat a carrot, taste sweet. Yeah it is. You're like, oh this is super sweet. Tastes good. You can eat too many carrots because your body can't digest them fully if you eat too many of them. Just FYI. I've made that mistake before. Pounding bags, a carrot. I look like one of those bags. Guards. Your gut is going to tell you no. Do an issue. Good. Noted Bro. Where are you going with all this? I'm making a good point. Unless you wanna talking about care. It's a little bit more, I can't, we can't, but nonetheless make it a point.

Speaker 7:          02:28:24       So these kids would make fun of us because they got the cookies and we had like tomatoes and sprouts in our sandwiches. But growing up when you come early adulthood, adulthood, that health consciousness paid off big time. Huge time check. So to make the switch from non-health consciousness to health consciousness, it's like it's, it can be a grind that can be harder. Yeah. [inaudible] path. Maintain the path. And it's already instilled as being a young person. So there's that. So milk. So my daughter comes home from school literally yesterday. Say they were teasing me because I had carrots and she was, she wasn't very happy about it. I was due to start token fools out. Well, I started to say that, but you, it was no time for jokes at this point cause she had been like, are you serious or not? I'm like, you don't wanna choke anyone for teasing you for your carrots, but this is what I said.

Speaker 7:          02:29:18       One of the things I said, I said, don't worry about them. T there's no, first of all there's nothing funny about carrots like there it's not, I'm not saying it's like or so serious. I'm just saying what's funny about I don't get it kind of thing. And she was like, yeah, that's kind of true. And I was like, and guess what? Carrots are good for you. Just like your lunch is good for you and as you grew up, you're going to see the results of that and you're going to see the results of them not eating, not healthy food. And you're going to see, you need to do better than that as a father. Why? Because you need a better teacher. No, she needs to be like, they say, oh, what are you eating? P You eating some, you eaten some carrots. And then she says, what do you eat in there?

Speaker 7:          02:29:54       Some type two diabetes, you're going to die at age 32 loser. Get out of my face, four, I put you to sleep all the implement. You know that that direction is not part of the way of the warrior kid code right there. Negative. No, that's are having fun. Fun is part of life. But I saw her wheels turning when she was like, like yeah, you know, like I will all see the results, you know, and then you know, then my wife's there and she's like, yeah look, you're dead. How big is muscle? All this stuff, right? So kind of close or your wife was kind of like just making stuff up unless it worked, but go back to [inaudible] or your kid milk. This is what you achieved with that. One of the many things is you actually made it like kind of cool to have a healthy thing.

Speaker 7:          02:30:38       Have a healthy snack. We're going to sway a lot of people with these books and this, this stuff is what's going to happen. I mean, I seen it. It's not even going to happen. It is happening. It's awesome to see. All right dude. We got to rock and roll. Columbia. That was an important story.

Well like I said or like you said, yeah, you can call them distract chins on the message, which I actually won't even argue with it. Thank you. But some people look at it or see it as enhanced. Oh, put some music on there. You put it enhances the message. It's kind of like Kinda like, you know when you have a dog and you gotta feed them the heartworm pills, you know, where are the pills? The heartworm pills is good for them. It's good. That message is good, but sometimes you got to put it in the food, you know, so like tastes good. It's like the message gets to deliver my messages so hard to swallow that you have to put like videos around it is what I'm hearing music around it.

You're like, I'm not sure if I should work out right now. Press play. Yeah. On the, on the psychological warfare track that's about not working out and you will get up and you will go to the gym. Yup. If you're about to eat some donuts. Yes. Or some chocolate chip cookies, right? Sure. Chips Ahoy, whatever. Chips Ahoy. If you find a sleeve of random chips ahoy hanging around somewhere, you know, use that term for the first time when it was, it was James Nielsen, what James Nielsen would talk about eating a sleeve leaf or just get bathroom.

Speaker 7:          02:36:13       James Nelson for world's toughest accountant. Agree? Yes. Black belt in Jujitsu for a long time. Oh Gee. American Jujitsu practitioners teaches on, on Saturdays here at victory, MMA and fitness, which by the way is our gym and San Diego, California. Do you want to train? So you know what's funny about that to where you know how you say, Oh yeah, to world's toughest accountant. Any teaches, do, do two, two. So teaching Jujitsu, that's a job. Like that's a career. Like you're a Jujitsu instructor, but he's like, he's an accountant but he just teaches you to, he's not like an accountant is like some, you know, scraping by sort of getting old and there's a few people like that. You know why? Because Teaching Jujitsu is fun and it makes you better at Jujitsu better. That's just how it is, man. The nature of the game that's on psychological warfare.

Speaker 7:          02:37:03       Also you can get it if you want some visual representation of the path to keep you there. You can go to flipside, canvas.com run by my brother, Dakota Meyer. He makes art with layers, with layers. The layers are free. Take while they, they're not free. They come with the cost of the art layers included, layers included. There you go. Yes, we've designed some of the items there. Yeah. You know, let them know like, hey, this would be kind of cold right here and if you want something just just request to Cota on Twitter I think is the best place. Yeah, and that's cool. Flip side, campus.com if you want to get some cool stuff to hang up at your house, back to psychological warfare, to use that whole thing as a playlist. Psychological warfare, even if it doesn't apply to you, you know you're not eating donuts Wa playlists while you work out.

Speaker 7:          02:37:53       Even if you're not eating donuts while you workout, which most of us do not. It still like it puts you in this mindset of like, you know, working in reaping the results of work. Yeah. It goes back to the podcast and machete season when they talk about how the power of the audio into your ear. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what's happening with psychological warfare going right in your ear. You like you walk, you get done. Listen to that. You're not even thinking about the fact that you're thinking about the fact you're what I just said. You're not thinking about the fact that you are thinking about the fact that you don't even want and don't want, that you want to get in the gym, that you want to attack your project. That's what's happening. It's true. 100% true. Also while you're live, if you're lifting at home, if we're doing the lifting at home, which I do, which you do, which a lot of us do, actually, people hit me up, show me their home set up.

Speaker 7:          02:38:43       Awesome. You should have kettlebells. In my opinion, kettlebells is one of the pretty much the biggest as far as changes to my workout, the most valuable change did I changed my workout functionality, functionality like the Benzos word. One time I was doing a, you know, you gotta introduce the risk control, you know, and bearing levels of risk control depending on the position there. I was rolling with the guy literally like he's like trying to release my grip from his wrist or whatever and like he's visibly angry because he couldn't. So I just sort of sat there and just let them like do it, whatever. That was his technique cause technically you should be able to get out of that shit. But I've been doing those kettlebells so my risk control is a lot. We'll say the effectiveness is a lot higher on the less original point kettlebells, this is where I get my kettlebells from on it. So you go to [inaudible] dot com slash Jocko there you can get these kettlebells and they're all the cool ones too by the way. Like always say Darth Vader. My most recent one, storm Trooper Kettlebell, my second most recent one, and not to mention all the other primal bells and legend bills that I have from there. Also at on it is the electrolyte mineral mix. That's part of my daily mega mix with Jockos discipline. Like I said, the mineral electrolyte mix water, maybe a little Gatorade. If, if I'm feeling a little feisty

Speaker 1:          02:40:14       and oh, that's how you take a joint warfare and Krill oil. Don't, don't, don't drink Gatorade. Everyone here, we got some books too. We got way of the warrior kid three where there's a will. It's out right now and for everyone that's gotten it so far, awesome. Appreciate it. Write some reviews so that I know what you think of it. That that is cool. If you have worried your work where we have the where kid three where there's a will, that means you should also have way where the word kid one and two number two is called Mark's mission. Also, we've got Mikey and the dragons best children's book ever written according to a lot of people. A lot of people dig it, lot of evil and tell me that I understand tons of people. Uh, no, seriously, check out Mike in the dragons. Help your kids overcome fear. Fear of all kinds. Also got the discipline equals freedom field manual. If you need to know how to get after it. If you want the audio version of that, it's on iTunes, Amazon music and Google play. Also, we got extreme ownership and the dichotomy of leadership written by myself and my brother Leif Babin extreme ownership number one, the selling business book. Since it got released the whole time. We just got that little stat. Dang. It's kind of cool. That's a big step. Yeah. Yeah. Some people

Speaker 1:          02:41:35       tell me that dichotomy of leadership is better. [inaudible] it's a good combo. I'll leave it at that Asheville on front. That is my leadership consultancy. What we do is solve problems through leadership. It is me, Leif Babin, JP Denelle, Dave Burke, Flynn Cochran, Mike's Really Mike [inaudible] and Jason Garner.
