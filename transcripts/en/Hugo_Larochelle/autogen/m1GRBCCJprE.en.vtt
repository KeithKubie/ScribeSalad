00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.090
 in this capsule we will introduce the 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.090
 problem of machine learning 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.710
 so this part of the court like 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.179
 cautious goal to cover the concepts 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.179
 basic in machine learning 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.560
 so in English we say machine learning 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.180
 machine learning this is the 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.600
 machine learning translation 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.580
 we will then see the deco algorithm 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.350
 nearest neighbors to make the 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.150
 classification in apprenticeship 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.920
 automatic to those of his having 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.929
 linear classification models 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.450
 specifically the tax collector's grid 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.270
 and logistic regression 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.879
 that will get us to talk about derby 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.460
 partial makes a reminder of the sounds derived 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.129
 then see what are the derivatives 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.050
 partial then also see what they 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.149
 optimization by gaza centers 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.219
 which is going to be useful in the context of the 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.500
 linear classification and finally to 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.670
 flight solve them in artificial who 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.170
 will also allow us to make the 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.050
 classification a different model 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.710
 classifications and that will get us to 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.589
 talk about rancial derivation and have 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:09.000
 the the algorithm of retro propagation of 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.740
 Christians so what is that 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.540
 machine learning and more 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.850
 specifically what we want 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.950
 say by learning in context 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.470
 artificial intelligence so we're going 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.840
 to say that an agent to prince he is capable 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.420
 to improve its performance on 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.890
 strange future with experience it's 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.979
 to say that as and when they 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.630
 observe data in one of 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.250
 observations in a given environment 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.409
 we will say that I learn if he is 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.619
 able to improve his behavior to 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.439
 from the observation of these data 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.310
 in the capsules we want to see 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.380
 this capsule hoisted the next 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.030
 capsule we will actually focus on 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.740
 a relatively learning problem 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.100
 5 kg super learning problems 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.439
 use that one can formulate as if so 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.170
 given a collection of data 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.689
 who are going to be fathers entered and 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.460
 associated outputs so she gave herself 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.890
 we'll call it examples 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.840
 learning 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.000
 we will be interested in commenting on what we 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.819
 can learn a function that can 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.009
 correctly predict the output but for 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.010
 a new entry that is not part 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.140
 of our examples 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.730
 wise so that's what they mean 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.959
 by machine learning and 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.420
 specifically we will talk 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.650
 learning supervise how 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.269
 can we take data 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.310
 which are entries associating 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.799
 outings and that we can have a 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.510
 algorithm that's going to be able 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:30.400
 to extract a function so a 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.140
 program that will be able to do 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.610
 predictions on news 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.310
 inputs ideally who will be able 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:42.099
 to predict the real output associated this 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:44.290
 entrance so why is that in 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:47.379
 do we want to schedule have 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.640
 programs that are able to learn 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:52.239
 so why not just 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.489
 programs and programs that actually 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.200
 do it themselves without having to 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.989
 take it without having to find this 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.840
 function there so sometimes actually it's 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.030
 too difficult to anticipate all 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.590
 possible entries that we will have to deal with 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.139
 and knew easier in fact of 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.049
 collect data that matches 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:13.180
 to kotick that we think we face 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.959
 in the future then to just say to the 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.699
 program to adapt to these data there 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:21.790
 so it's handy to have a 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:24.370
 algorithm my agent who fits who 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.799
 learns if the relationship between entry and 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.319
 the output you want to predict evolved 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.120
 of yesteryear so that's the case are at his fault 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.829
 of the spam classification or 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.109
 do the spam that can be done 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.310
 know the 10 years are different this 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:39.280
 that we are today just because 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.230
 those who make systems 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.840
 in your email and then that determines 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.510
 how to write an email have adapted 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.669
 their strategy in time for 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.220
 try to outsmart the different 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:54.609
 sensors the different classes ya of 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.829
 spam and generally also 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:58.480
 in fact often we have no idea 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:00.639
 how in fact programmed this 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.609
 function there desire in which predicts a 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:05.739
 exit from an entry so in 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:10.329
 what if it's basically basically 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:13.659
 the only practical way really 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:15.370
 achievable in practice the of getting 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:17.440
 this function there for example one makes of 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.750
 face recognition is very 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.700
 difficult to come to define ourselves 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.690
 a program that observes the different 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.600
 pixels in an image that is capable 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:31.330
 come to a decision on what is 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.330
 the identity of the person in the picture 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.970
 there are several types of problems 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.870
 machine learning 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.580
 the one we're going to focus on 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.140
 in the next capture this is the one 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.480
 capsule is that of learning 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.640
 supervise so in this case also in 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.380
 makes the exit that is desired or a 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.560
 data entry will be provided 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.690
 explicitly in our data and so 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.750
 we will see fathers entered and 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.700
 exits an example of problems that we 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.960
 can solve with learning 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.970
 supervise is that of the 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.560
 character recognition and dense 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.450
 that if we give drive our 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.420
 learning examples will match 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:10.070
 to fathers of image or some euros 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.510
 identify what is the identity of the 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:17.000
 character that is in this picture 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:18.370
 there later other capsules we go 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.050
 see also a learning tool 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.700
 reinforcement learning and the 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.930
 distinction is that rather than having 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.120
 an explicit exit 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.860
 actually our learning signal 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.250
 information on comment what our 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.050
 agents 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.590
 our model will have to adapt your 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.419
 correspondence that it is to 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:38.750
 rewards or punishments 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:41.360
 ok so and that's the type of learning 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.820
 which will be useful if we wish between 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.580
 others do the design of a model or 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.210
 an agent trying to learn how to play 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.430
 In chess 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.110
 then in this case also actually the signal 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.300
 learning the rewards the 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:57.410
 punishments it could be that our 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:59.660
 agent will receive a signal 1 for the body 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:02.810
 or won a part is less 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.340
 hour it failed and then the sooner 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.110
 lost the part so in this case one 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.430
 would have a punishment so in 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.650
 learning parents inevitably we're going 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.690
 design duty and seasoned who 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:15.280
 can handle this type of signal 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.280
 learning this type of data there 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:21.630
 and there is also non-learning 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.730
 supervised which will not be discussed in the 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.650
 rescue capsules sis but when I 

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:27.780
 supports anyway when mentioned when 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:30.030
 if at last we have data that 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.730
 match only an entry and we have 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.690
 no explicit signal on how the 

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:34.980
 model needs to adapt 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:37.950
 so the model has to extract 

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:40.830
 information only from the 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:44.190
 structure discovered inside the 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:46.050
 entries so an example of that is so 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:48.690
 we had several newspaper articles 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:51.120
 we might want to identify what 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:53.160
 are the different themes that are 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.290
 treated by all those days there for 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:59.340
 groups and group articles 

00:06:55.290 --> 00:07:01.230
 according to these themes there is so this task 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:04.080
 there it is designated in English as 

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:06.210
 clustering dip or in French of 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.740
 grouping of articles in this case 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:10.110
 we do not know for all items 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:12.540
 we have in our data that they read 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:14.610
 these themes question these themes and we 

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.300
 will develop algorithms that will 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:18.900
 also try to identify 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:20.220
 these themes automatically so that's 

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:23.790
 an example there are actually 

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:26.580
 several others that's the problem it's 

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:28.800
 learning and if you want in 

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:31.410
 know more I invite you to consult 

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:34.640
 the works that are dedicated to the machine 

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:34.640
 learning in machine learning
