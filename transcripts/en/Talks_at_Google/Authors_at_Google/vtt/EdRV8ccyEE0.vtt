00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:05.240
BORIS: Today with us
is Dr. Lewis Dartnell.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.250
His newest book is-- could
I have a copy of the book

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.940
please-- "The Knowledge,
How to Rebuild Our World

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.620
From Scratch."

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:24.085
So it's like when I was
pitched by the publishers, hey,

00:00:24.085 --> 00:00:26.910
you should have Lewis come
and give a talk at Google.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.244
I was looking at what is
this, "The Knowledge?"

00:00:29.244 --> 00:00:31.160
There's a lot of knowledge
and all that stuff.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.665
And then I read a description
which says-- here,

00:00:34.665 --> 00:00:35.540
I'll read it for you.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.830
So maybe it was an asteroid
impact, a nuclear war,

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.360
or a viral pandemic.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.670
Whatever the cause, the world,
as we know it has ended.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.250
And you and the other
survivors must start again.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.300
What key knowledge
would you need

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.850
to not only survive in
the immediate aftermath,

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.650
but avert another dark ages
and accelerate the rebooting

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.560
of civilization from scratch?

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.800
Which I thought was an excellent
idea for a technology book,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.350
how to make the history
of technology more fun.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.280
Well, not fun really,
but it presents

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.920
the history of technology
in a different way.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.240
And I think a lot of
people actually agree

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.330
that the book is a great read.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.250
So just to quote
from "The Times,"

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.840
"The Knowledge" is a "New
York Times" and "Sunday Times"

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.680
best seller, and was also
awarded "The Times" New

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.630
Thinking Book of the Year, or
from "The Wall Street Journal,"

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.250
"The Knowledge" is
a fascinating look

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.260
at the basic principles of the
most important technologies

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.790
undergirding modern society.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.030
It's a fun read full of optimism
about human ingenuity," which

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.110
is something that I liked.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.620
"Terrifically engrossing history
of science and technology,"

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.990
"The Guardian."

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.270
"The ultimate
do-it-yourself guide

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.365
to rebooting human
civilization," "Nature."

00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:59.830
So Dr. Lewis Dartnell is a UK
Space Agency research fellow

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.100
at the University of Leicester.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.960
So this is a rocket
scientist here.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.729
He also holds an STFC,
Science in Society Fellowship,

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.230
and alongside his
astrobiology research,

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.990
writes regular science articles
in newspapers and magazines.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.070
He has appeared in TV shows
such as the BBC "Horizon,"

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.950
"Wonders of the Universe,"
and documentaries

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.470
on National Geographic,
Discovery, and History

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.480
Channels.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.707
Please join me in welcoming
Lewis Dartnell to Google.

00:02:31.707 --> 00:02:32.790
LEWIS DARTNELL: Thank you.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.670
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.570
Good afternoon everyone,
and thank you all very much

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.180
for coming along to hear me.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.449
My name's Lewis, as
you've just heard,

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:46.490
and I'm a research fellow
based at the University

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.500
of Leicester in the space
research center there.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.910
And my day job, what I do
when I'm not running off

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.530
writing books is working
within astrobiology, which

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.450
is a relatively new
field of science,

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.250
all about extending what
we know about the origins

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.660
and the survival limits
of life here on earth,

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.662
and extending that to
the possibility of life

00:03:06.662 --> 00:03:08.620
on other planets-- in
particular, our next door

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.030
neighbor planet, Mars, where I
spend most of my time thinking,

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.030
could terrestrial life tolerate
and survive the conditions

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.950
on the surface of Mars?

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.770
Or more importantly,
what tests could we

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.220
design to put on a Mars Rover
and send to the Red Planet

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.300
to try to detect
those signs of life,

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.700
those so-called biosignatures.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.430
But something I've been
thinking about a lot more

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.280
over the last two
or three years is

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.080
on something completely
and utterly different.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.530
And let's imagine that
this has actually happened.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.720
There's been some kind of global
catastrophe, a doomsday event.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.930
And the vast majority
of humanity has died,

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.115
and our civilization
has collapsed.

00:03:52.115 --> 00:03:55.710
But let's say that some
people have survived.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.850
Let's say that the room
we're in here in Google

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.900
has served as some kind
of hardened bunker,

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.740
and we have survived the end
of the world as we know it.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.000
And we stumble outside
in an hour's time

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.180
and find ourselves in the
ruins of the civilization that

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.050
came before us.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.680
Well, what now?

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.950
What would you need to
know not just to survive

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.780
in the immediate aftermath,
but to thrive in the long term?

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.870
How could you go about
rebuilding a society

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.355
for yourself, a
society from scratch?

00:04:31.355 --> 00:04:32.730
And what could
you do to actually

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.810
accelerate the rebooting
of civilization,

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.090
to recover all of the
science and technology

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.690
that we have today?

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.000
Could you navigate some
kind of shortcut route

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.120
through that vast
interlinked network

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.950
of scientific discoveries
and new technologies

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.770
that they allow, and their new
scientific discoveries can make

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.929
from applying new technology,
like the telescope

00:04:52.929 --> 00:04:54.720
and the microscope, to
find out new things?

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.000
Could you navigate a shortcut
route through that network

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.650
rather than meandering,
stumbling down blind alleys

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.240
route that we took
the first time around?

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.100
So could you
accelerate what took us

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.740
perhaps 10,000
years the first time

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.690
and squash that down to
perhaps a few generations

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.240
or a few centuries
if you're trying

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.010
to recover from scratch
with hindsight, knowing

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:17.155
what we know now?

00:05:17.155 --> 00:05:21.900
So in short, if we were to be
a community of survivors, what

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.300
would be the one book
that you would want handed

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.610
to you as a manual
for rebuilding

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.060
the world from scratch,
to reboot civilization?

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.560
And it should come
as no surprise.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.690
And that is the book
that I've tried to write

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.080
called, "The Knowledge."

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.000
But I think I should
obviously come clean with you

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.510
right at the beginning.

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.849
I do not think the world
is actually about to end.

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:45.390
I'm not coming from
the point of view

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.160
of a survivalist or a prepper.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.830
I'm not talking
about survival skills

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.790
or how you can skin badgers.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.550
I've come from the
scientific background.

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.510
I'd be very
interested to explore,

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:59.050
as a thought experiment, all of
the behind the scenes basics.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.842
What are the foundations to
support our modern world?

00:06:01.842 --> 00:06:03.550
What are the things
that we just take for

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.040
granted in our everyday lives?

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.670
How does all of that work?

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.300
And importantly, how'd it
develop through history.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.960
What enables civilizations
to progress, and therefore,

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.770
how could you try and accelerate
that process the second time

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:18.866
around?

00:06:18.866 --> 00:06:22.960
And I think a very neat example
of the challenges that we would

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.025
face trying to start
everything from scratch

00:06:26.025 --> 00:06:30.380
are presented in an essay
by Leonard Read called,

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.540
"I, Pencil."

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.280
Now, the "I, Pencil" isn't some
great new gadget coming out

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.874
from Apple.

00:06:36.874 --> 00:06:37.415
It's a story.

00:06:37.415 --> 00:06:41.200
It's a narrative, told from
the point of view of a pencil,

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.000
from this simplest
tool or implement

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.600
that we're ever likely
to interact with or use

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.760
in our day-to-day lives.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.630
It turns out, there's
not a single person

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:54.510
on the planet that knows
how to make a pencil-- no

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.690
one person on the planet,
because of course,

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.980
human knowledge is distributed
across the entire population

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.630
from people that know how
to operate a timber mill,

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.650
or mining metal ore
out of the ground,

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:10.230
or refining the fuels that
we use to transport and move

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:11.670
everything around.

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:14.240
There's no one person that
knows all the details of all

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.050
of those parts.

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.550
And it's just the simplest
part of our everyday lives.

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:20.970
So imagine multiplying
that amongst all the higher

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:24.740
technology that we
rely upon today.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.730
And the thought experiment
that I'm talking about here,

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:29.670
about how to go right
back from scratch

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.270
and preserve the most
valuable knowledge that you

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:35.820
could has been touched
upon through the years.

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.380
There's nothing truly
original or novel about what

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:39.909
I'm talking about here.

00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:42.450
I'm sure many of you would all
know of things like the Global

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:45.756
Village Construction Set,
or The Toaster Project,

00:07:45.756 --> 00:07:47.630
which is run by a guy
called Thomas Thwaites,

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:48.799
who also lived in London.

00:07:48.799 --> 00:07:50.590
So I interviewed him
when I was researching

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:51.680
for "The Knowledge."

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.260
And he tried to make a
toaster from scratch.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.090
And I don't just mean buying
components and screwdriving

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:57.990
them together.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:00.520
I mean going underground,
there is an iron mine,

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.410
and coming out with
some rust colored rocks

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:06.950
and trying to smelt them in
his back garden and a dustbin.

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:11.100
And what he produced was this
grotesquely beautiful toaster

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.712
at the end, which never worked.

00:08:12.712 --> 00:08:14.420
The first time he
plugged into the mains,

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:15.500
it almost caught fire.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.870
A great big puff of magic
smoke came out the top.

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:19.310
And it never worked.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:21.680
But that's the point
of the project,

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.680
to demonstrate just how hard
even the simple things we take

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:28.150
for granted would be if
you had to make or do them

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:29.970
yourself from scratch.

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:33.052
And perhaps the earliest
example dates all the way back

00:08:33.052 --> 00:08:36.600
to the 1750s when the
very earliest encyclopedia

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.549
writers, people
like Denis Diderot,

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:42.230
were trying to make a
genuine effort to write down

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:45.350
the sum total of human knowledge
that was known at that time.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:47.910
They tried to write the
total book, the book that

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:49.830
contained everything.

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:52.820
And Diderot, in fact,
explicitly considered

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:56.270
his duty in compiling and
writing this encyclopedia

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:59.750
was to serve as a
store of knowledge.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:01.520
If civilization
were to collapse,

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.520
you would want to store
the most vital knowledge

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.190
and protect it as a
seed, as a kernel,

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:09.190
so you could then
rebuild again afterwards.

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:12.380
Back in the 1750s, people
were much more aware

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:15.160
of how even great civilizations
can collapse like Rome,

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.412
and Greece, and Egypt.

00:09:16.412 --> 00:09:18.620
And perhaps we're a little
bit more arrogant today at

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:22.610
how vulnerable
civilizations can be.

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:26.570
And so the major themes that
I researched and wrote about.

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:29.380
These are [INAUDIBLE]
the chapters of the book.

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:31.340
Talking about things
from agriculture

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:35.230
and how so few of us today
have any real idea about how

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:38.840
to walk out on muddy field with
a handful of seed and make food

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.420
come back out of that field
before the winter draws in

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:43.100
and you starve to
death, or talking

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.045
about different
materials and substances.

00:09:45.045 --> 00:09:46.790
If you just reach
into your pocket

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:48.340
now and pull out
all the things you

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.850
might find in there
from coins, to gadgets,

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:53.770
or different devices,
even basic stuff,

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:55.890
like how do you get metal
to come out of rock, out

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:56.790
of the ore?

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:58.873
How many people really
know how to do that anymore

00:09:58.873 --> 00:10:01.710
and yet, think how vital
materials like metals

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:03.201
really are?

00:10:03.201 --> 00:10:04.950
And doing the talk,
I'll skip through some

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:06.325
of these other
areas of medicine,

00:10:06.325 --> 00:10:08.670
and power, and communication.

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:11.800
But actually, the chapter that
I found most satisfying, again,

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:15.425
as a mini thought experiment
to research and write about

00:10:15.425 --> 00:10:17.700
was this penultimate
chapter, time and place.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.450
And again, the thought
experiment for this

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:22.250
might be imagine you
wake up from a coma,

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:24.690
or you stumble out
of a cryogenic pod,

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:26.440
or you've fallen
through a time warp,

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.120
and you find yourself
somewhere on the earth

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.000
at some point in the future.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.970
But you have no idea where
you are or when you are.

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:38.130
So what simple
observations can you make?

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:40.600
How can you work
from first principles

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:44.950
to calculate where on the planet
you are, what address you are,

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:46.534
what latitude and
longitude you're at.

00:10:46.534 --> 00:10:48.574
But also, when you are,
not just the time of day,

00:10:48.574 --> 00:10:49.710
not if it's at lunch time.

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:52.040
You can build a sundial
relatively easily.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.465
But what is the date?

00:10:53.465 --> 00:10:54.590
What day of the year is it?

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:57.262
How could you reconstruct
the calendar from scratch

00:10:57.262 --> 00:10:58.720
or even work out
what year it might

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:02.000
be 10,000 years in the
future from observing things

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:02.940
around you?

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:05.530
And again, these aren't
frivolous exercises.

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:07.880
Being able to work out
where you on the planet

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:11.225
is the absolute essence, is the
prerequisite for navigation,

00:11:11.225 --> 00:11:13.835
and exploring the
oceans, and trading.

00:11:13.835 --> 00:11:16.210
And being able to track your
progress through the seasons

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:18.830
and using the calendar is
an absolute prerequisite

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:20.500
for agriculture,
and making sure you

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.140
put your seeds in the
ground at the right time,

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.220
and take them out at the
right time for harvest

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.790
so you don't starve to death.

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:29.920
Boris, when do we run until?

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:30.790
BORIS: Sorry?

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:31.140
LEWIS DARTNELL: How
long is the talk?

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:32.291
How long is this slot?

00:11:32.291 --> 00:11:33.415
BORIS: As much as you want.

00:11:33.415 --> 00:11:33.870
One hour.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:34.860
LEWIS DARTNELL: You don't
really mean as long as you want,

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:35.359
do you?

00:11:35.359 --> 00:11:36.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.220
No, I've got about 45 minutes.

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:39.010
I suddenly thought,
I probably should

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:41.530
have checked that before
I launched myself in.

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:45.530
But if we stay within
the kind of premise

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:48.950
for thought experiments, this
post-apocalyptic world where

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:51.100
most of the people
have suddenly died,

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.900
but the stuff is
left lying around,

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:55.590
you'd be afforded
a grace period.

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:58.020
You wouldn't have to work out
the very first morning when

00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:59.770
you wake up with a
hangover from the night

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:01.360
before when the world,
as we know, has ended.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.609
You wouldn't have to work
out agriculture for yourself

00:12:03.609 --> 00:12:05.295
immediately, because
you could scavenge

00:12:05.295 --> 00:12:08.080
and forage for what you need.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.070
And particularly
within food, today, we

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:14.630
are exceedingly good at
preserving and stockpiling

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:15.130
food.

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:16.860
We create artificial winter.

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:20.180
We exploit the gas laws to
make refrigerators and freezers

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:22.540
to preserve food, and
particularly, the canning

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:23.660
process.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:26.620
This food will remain
good for decades.

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:28.750
So again, as a
thought experiment,

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.790
I wanted to know,
if I was locked

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:33.200
in an average supermarket,
how long could I

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.810
survive for before I'd
either eaten all of the food

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:40.072
or I'd gone off before I
could get around to eating it?

00:12:40.072 --> 00:12:41.780
And conveniently, the
average supermarket

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:43.488
was the one just down
the road from where

00:12:43.488 --> 00:12:45.060
I live in North London.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:46.800
And I walked up and
down all the aisles,

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.980
multiplying up all of
the food that was there,

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:50.438
dividing it by the
amount you would

00:12:50.438 --> 00:12:52.260
need to eat per day to survive.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.440
And it turns out that
a single supermarket

00:12:54.440 --> 00:13:00.380
could keep you alive for
55 years, or 63 years,

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:03.940
if you're happy to eat all the
canned dog food and cat food,

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:04.440
as well.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.452
There's a vast reserve
of food lying around

00:13:06.452 --> 00:13:07.910
that you could keep
yourself going,

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:10.630
you could coast upon,
dine out on the leftovers,

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:12.750
whilst you work out
through trial and error

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:16.140
how to do farming for yourself,
before that food runs out

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:19.260
and it becomes a matter
of life and death.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.290
And obviously, beyond
food, drinking water

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:26.720
is another absolute
requirement for a healthy life.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.840
So how can you apply
modern knowledge,

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.580
modern understanding,
to know for a fact

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:33.290
the water you're
about to put your lips

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:35.550
and drink is not
going to kill you?

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:38.976
That doesn't contain cholera,
or typhoid, or any other number

00:13:38.976 --> 00:13:40.350
of waterborne
diseases which have

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:43.642
been the scourge of
humanity throughout history?

00:13:43.642 --> 00:13:45.850
And again, if you're scavenging
through the abandoned

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:47.910
supermarkets and
dead cities, you

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:49.690
could get things
like kitchen bleach.

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:53.465
And if you dilute kitchen bleach
enough-- do not drink it neat.

00:13:53.465 --> 00:13:55.800
If you dilute kitchen
bleach enough,

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.630
you can chemically
disinfect the water,

00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:58.870
and it'll be safe to drink.

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:01.172
You're exploiting the
chemistry of chlorine

00:14:01.172 --> 00:14:03.630
in exactly the same way the
water coming out of the faucets

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:05.590
is treated with
chlorine to disinfect

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:06.710
and make it safe to drink.

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:08.770
If you can't find
any kitchen bleach,

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:11.030
you can use swimming
pool chlorine.

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:14.260
So sodium hypochlorite
or calcium hypochlorite

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.520
will disinfect water for you.

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:18.580
But actually, there's
an even simpler way,

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:22.600
a process called SODIS,
or solar disinfection,

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.500
which has been touted by the
World Health Organization

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:28.105
around the developing world
to break the disease cycle

00:14:28.105 --> 00:14:31.540
and stop hundreds of thousands
of people dying of diarrhea.

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:34.790
And all you need to do is
fill an empty plastic bottle

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:37.770
with water and
leave it in the sun.

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:39.530
And because that
bottle is essentially

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:41.665
constraining the water
to be very shallow,

00:14:41.665 --> 00:14:43.320
the ultraviolet rays
and the sunlight

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:46.390
can shine straight through
and kill any pathogens

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:47.140
that are in there.

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:50.150
You can come back a day or
two later, drink that water,

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:54.010
and know for a fact
that it's safe to drink.

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:57.720
Now, fire, as well, has
been an absolute foundation

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:00.350
of society for millennia,
for thousands and thousands

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:01.477
of years.

00:15:01.477 --> 00:15:03.810
But again, I suspect there's
not many people in the room

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:06.130
here, if you couldn't
reach for a box of matches

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:08.836
or for a lighter, could
you actually get a fire

00:15:08.836 --> 00:15:09.710
started for yourself?

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:12.080
How many people know how
to rub sticks together

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.667
to ignite a fire successfully?

00:15:14.667 --> 00:15:17.000
And we don't just use fire
for cooking food, and killing

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.230
germs, and keeping us warm.

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:23.310
Civilization uses fire to take
the base stuff that we dig out

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:26.830
of the ground and transform it
into the most useful substances

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:28.635
and materials of history.

00:15:28.635 --> 00:15:32.460
We use fire to take
river mud, clay,

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:34.500
and turn it into bricks
we use for building.

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.787
We use fire to get metal
out of rock, out of the ore.

00:15:37.787 --> 00:15:39.995
And we use fire to drive
all of the crucial chemistry

00:15:39.995 --> 00:15:42.330
that our society depends
upon, like making

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:45.790
artificial fertilizers that
feed over 2 billion people

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:47.040
on the planet today.

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:50.220
Our modern world is
as reliant on fire

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:53.670
as a Stone Age family
huddled around the campfire.

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:57.240
We've just hidden it behind
the scenes in our factories

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.340
and power stations.

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:01.409
But it's still as critical.

00:16:01.409 --> 00:16:02.700
So how do you get a fire going?

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:05.880
I've got a quick
video to show you,

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:08.465
which we filmed for
the book coming out

00:16:08.465 --> 00:16:10.990
in hardback last year.

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:14.690
And this is about how you
can use unusual combinations

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:17.190
of everyday items to
start a fire if you

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:19.990
can't find matches or lighters.

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:23.240
And this one is how we can use
a smoke detector or a fire alarm

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.240
to start a fire, paradoxically.

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:31.430
So the way that you start
a fire with a fire alarm,

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:35.200
with a smoke detector,
is to pop off the back

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.150
and take out the batteries
that you find inside.

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:41.495
And specifically, the nine volt
batteries, which are special,

00:16:41.495 --> 00:16:42.870
because out of
the two terminals,

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:46.780
the positive and next terminal,
both are at the same end.

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:50.450
And if you also scavenge
from an abandoned supermarket

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:55.330
or house some steel wool, you
can short circuit the battery

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:56.520
through steel wool.

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.570
Do not do this at home.

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:00.840
But totally have a
go at this at home.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:03.280
And if you brush ever so
gently and then blow on it

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:08.470
with any kindling, you can get
that metal to absolutely burst

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:09.180
into flames.

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:12.130
This isn't trying newspaper
or kindling burning.

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:15.329
That's the metal itself
bursting into flames.

00:17:15.329 --> 00:17:18.676
And if you can crack the
trick-- so obviously, what

00:17:18.676 --> 00:17:20.259
we're exploiting
here is the principle

00:17:20.259 --> 00:17:21.190
of electrical resistance.

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:22.599
You're passing a current
through a very thin wire

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:25.800
with very high resistance, so it
gets hot and burst into flames.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.910
If you can crack the trick of
getting a thin wire very hot

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:30.820
and not burst into
flames, you've

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:32.060
just invented the light bulb.

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:34.210
It's exactly what
Edison solved to exploit

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:36.720
exactly the same principle.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.610
And so electricity,
as well, as it's

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:41.845
been a foundation of
our modern society.

00:17:41.845 --> 00:17:43.580
And what I try to do
throughout the book,

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:45.480
throughout "The
Knowledge," was to keep

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:48.150
basing the things I'm
talking about on real world

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:50.570
examples, not
arm-waving speculation,

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:53.700
but occasions in history
where people have solved

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:57.080
challenges and problems
in particular ways.

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.140
And what we're looking
at here is a city

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:02.470
called Gorazde, which during
the mid-1990s in the Bosnian

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:06.270
Serbian War, this city was
surrounded by the Army,

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:09.480
and isolated, cut off
from rest of the world.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:13.540
And although NATO was able to
get food and medication dropped

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:15.700
to them, they were cut off
of the electrical grid.

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:17.520
They were thrown back
into the Middle Ages

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.720
in the sense of this
component to our modern world.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.440
And so what the inhabitants
of Gorazde were able to do

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:26.180
was scavenge and forage from
rubbish, junk just lying

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:27.310
around their city.

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:30.100
And doing junkyard
wars, but for real, they

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:32.460
made these water
wheels, which they

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.840
dunked into the river in
the fast-flowing stream

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.260
tethered to the bridge here.

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.930
And the crucial component
right in the middle of each

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:42.510
of these water wheels, the thing
that converts that rotation

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:45.994
into electricity, is an
alternator, a component

00:18:45.994 --> 00:18:47.410
you can scavenge
under the bonnet,

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:49.610
under the hood of any
car or abandoned truck

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:51.710
you find lying around,
and just jury rig

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:55.520
stuff together to keep your
civilized lifestyle going.

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:58.095
I think it's an incredible
example of the ingenuity

00:18:58.095 --> 00:19:00.960
and resourcefulness of
just everyday people

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.640
under challenging circumstances.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.181
This is the kind of
skills you'd want

00:19:04.181 --> 00:19:07.110
to try and apply to rebuilding
society again from scratch

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:09.580
yourself after an apocalypse.

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:13.204
But sooner or later, this grace
period will draw to an end.

00:19:13.204 --> 00:19:15.120
Things will run out, or
decay, or deteriorate,

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:19.250
or you'll just have used them
up without making them yourself.

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:21.420
And particularly
with agriculture,

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:24.035
the most important
plant in history

00:19:24.035 --> 00:19:26.520
have been these,
the cereal crops,

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:30.790
and in particular, the first
three-- wheat, rice, and maize,

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:35.070
which have supported all of the
civilizations of Europe, Asia,

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:37.790
and the Americas.

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:41.385
And the dependence of humanity
throughout civilization,

00:19:41.385 --> 00:19:43.940
our dependence on
these cereal crops,

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:46.270
it means that throughout
history, humanity

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:49.210
has survived by
eating grass, just

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:51.290
like our cows and our sheep.

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:55.330
The cereal crops evolved as
fast-growing species of grass.

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:58.335
They make an ideal plant
to eat in that sense.

00:19:58.335 --> 00:20:00.450
But we had a problem.

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:05.760
The kernel of wheat is a
fabulous nugget of nutrition.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.320
But it's hard and indigestible.

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.930
So we need to break
down that grain

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:13.530
to release nutrients to
be absorbed by our bodies.

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:15.390
And the main inventions
through history

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:19.020
that have helped with this
have been the Roman water wheel

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:20.990
and the medieval windmill.

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:22.780
These are obviously
ways of harnessing

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:26.600
natural power sources,
hydropower and wind power.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.040
But the crucial components
of both of these

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:32.920
is this pair of cylindrical
slabs, the millstones which

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:36.530
turn over each other and
grind that grain into flour.

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:39.305
This is a relic of Stone
Age technology right

00:20:39.305 --> 00:20:42.130
in the heart of the complex
mechanisms of the windmill

00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:43.320
here.

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.770
And we take that
flour, and we cook it.

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:47.636
We bake bread.

00:20:47.636 --> 00:20:49.760
And the heat of the fire
that we use for cooking

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.820
makes the food tastes
nice, but more importantly,

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:55.270
helps to break down that
nutrition so that we

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:57.510
can absorb it into our bodies.

00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:00.770
So in a very real
sense, the millstone

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:03.965
is like a technological
extension of our own molar

00:21:03.965 --> 00:21:05.040
teeth.

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.043
And the oven we use for
baking bread, or the pot

00:21:07.043 --> 00:21:11.080
we use for boiling rice is
like an external predigestive

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.070
system.

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:13.780
Humanity doesn't
have the benefit

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:15.410
of four stomachs like a cow.

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:17.990
We're biologically
disadvantaged in that sense.

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:21.320
So we've had to adopt technology
to enable us to live off

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:24.890
fast-growing species of grass.

00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:26.710
Now again, I suspect
not many people

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:30.200
would know where to go to pick
up some seed corn or some wheat

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.450
that you can put in the
ground and grow and harvest.

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:35.470
And so this is
where you would go.

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:38.880
This is the Svalbard
Global Seed Vault.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.050
This is the front door.

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:41.430
These are blast proof doors.

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:44.865
This place could genuinely
survive a nuclear exchange.

00:21:44.865 --> 00:21:47.240
And the fact that it's built
into the side of a mountain,

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:49.281
away from the Arctic
Circle, means the permafrost

00:21:49.281 --> 00:21:52.830
of the mountain around it, that
even if the grid goes down,

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:54.900
this thing would remain
naturally refrigerated

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:57.410
for hundreds, if not
thousands of years.

00:21:57.410 --> 00:21:59.520
You would hope that
when you got here,

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:03.040
someone had left the door key
under the mat at the front

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.990
so you could open those doors.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:08.446
But this is designed to be
like a biological safe file,

00:22:08.446 --> 00:22:11.774
a genetic library of all of
the major crops we grow today.

00:22:11.774 --> 00:22:13.190
And this is exactly
where you want

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:16.620
to go to get wheat, or
rice, or any other cereal

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:19.050
crops or other crops that
you would need to reboot

00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:20.670
agriculture for yourself.

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:23.100
If you don't know
where Svalbard is,

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.240
I've very helpfully
for you, provided

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.820
the latitude and longitude
coordinates that you'd go to.

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:29.862
And if you don't know your
latitude and longitude

00:22:29.862 --> 00:22:32.236
coordinates, if you don't know
what your address is right

00:22:32.236 --> 00:22:34.680
here, and therefore, what
direction to start heading in,

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.740
turn to that time and
place chapter in the book.

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:39.460
And I explain to you
from first principles,

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:41.790
using stuff around you,
how you can determine

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:43.470
exactly where you
are, and therefore,

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:45.060
how to navigate to there.

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:46.795
So as far as
possible, everything

00:22:46.795 --> 00:22:48.920
within "The Knowledge,"
everything within the book,

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.620
interlinks to everything else.

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:53.260
I don't assume any prior
or external knowledge.

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:55.089
I contain as far
as I can everything

00:22:55.089 --> 00:22:56.380
you'll need in this one manual.

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:03.650
I've skipped through
substances quite quickly.

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:06.140
But in terms of software
design and technology,

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:08.640
you'll be familiar with
similar diagrams like this.

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:11.127
They're chains of
dependencies of to make this,

00:23:11.127 --> 00:23:13.210
you need that, which needs
this, which needs that,

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:18.020
and how they link together to
build capability over time.

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:19.670
And these are all
that the main things

00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:23.070
that you need to run a society,
and that we've relied upon

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:25.160
and depended upon
through history.

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:28.705
And the nodes, the hub of
the chemical capability

00:23:28.705 --> 00:23:30.830
of the substances
tree are things

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:34.070
like lime and soda, which you
may not have even ever heard

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:36.600
of, but they are the most
fundamentally important things

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:39.800
that you rely upon day upon
day in our everyday lives

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:40.610
without realizing.

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:43.212
And I explain how to
make lime for yourself

00:23:43.212 --> 00:23:45.670
or soda for yourself and how
to use soda to make everything

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:48.870
from paper, to soap, to glass,
how you start with glass,

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:51.642
and then you can now grind
lenses to make lenses,

00:23:51.642 --> 00:23:53.100
to make telescopes
and microscopes,

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:56.350
and use microscopes to discover
germs to stop you getting sick.

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:57.767
So all of this,
links in together.

00:23:57.767 --> 00:23:59.808
There are ingredients and
ingredients and recipes

00:23:59.808 --> 00:24:02.380
in the book as to how to
do all that basic chemistry

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:04.390
for yourself.

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:07.060
And within transport,
what you would really

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:10.640
hope that your post-apocalyptic
society, that you could stop

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:15.460
the regression before you reach
a state like this where you can

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:17.450
no longer run mechanization.

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:19.990
You've lost engines
and machinery.

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:22.780
And this is more important
than just jumping in your car

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:24.240
and nipping down the road.

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:26.760
We use machinery and
internal combustion engine

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.680
for doing everything
in the world around us,

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:31.415
and releasing the effort
of our own muscles.

00:24:31.415 --> 00:24:35.460
So the question is, how can you
run machinery without access

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:37.260
to crude oil, and the
diesel, and gasoline

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:40.100
that are refined from it?

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:43.270
I've got another video that
I'm going to load up briefly.

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:46.500
So this is the point on the TED
stage last week where I almost

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:48.720
set fire to my own head.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.470
So I'm not going to
do that indoors again.

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:53.580
I'm going to show you the video.

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:57.320
So what we've got is a
gasifier stove, it's called.

00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:00.980
And I made this one myself
out of some old junk tin cans.

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:04.610
And there's a big outer can,
and a smaller can inside it,

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:06.555
and holes at the bottom of both.

00:25:06.555 --> 00:25:08.180
So when you put some
newspaper and just

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:11.690
a small handful of twigs in
the inner can and light it,

00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:14.540
it draws air up through
the bottom of that fire

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:18.620
to keep it nice and intense,
just like any barbecue.

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:21.240
But what is unique about
this gasifier stove

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:24.535
is that there is a second row
of holes right at the top.

00:25:24.535 --> 00:25:27.710
So as the wood breaks down
and the heat of that fire

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:32.480
undergoes pyrolysis, it releases
lots of gases, and vapors,

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:35.420
and smoke, which is
itself combustible.

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:38.300
And you then reintroduce
oxygen into that hot gas mix,

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:40.814
and combust everything
at that point.

00:25:40.814 --> 00:25:42.230
So when this is
up and running, it

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:45.510
is smokeless, and
exceedingly efficient.

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:49.390
And just to show you how
effective one of these really

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:52.830
primitive, simple
gasifier stoves can be,

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:55.610
this is me in a garage
in London demonstrating.

00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:58.140
And if you just
watch, I've genuinely

00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:01.290
put only a tiny handful of
little bits of twig in there.

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:04.040
There's very little fuel that
I'm loading this up with.

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:09.240
And in seconds, I'm going
to light this gas fire

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.060
stove using a lighter.

00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:13.240
But I hope that I've
convinced you at this point

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:15.365
that I could've used a
smoke detector if I'd really

00:26:15.365 --> 00:26:18.720
wanted to to get the gasifier
stove up and running.

00:26:21.919 --> 00:26:25.390
And it smokes a little bit
as it first gets going.

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:28.400
But if you watch,
as I put the flue

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.860
on top, which again, is just
made from small tin cans,

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:33.150
within about four
seconds, the smoke

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:37.620
disappears and is replaced
by this 4 foot jet of flame

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:39.905
coming out at the top.

00:26:39.905 --> 00:26:44.260
So this is the airflow
coming up through that fire,

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:46.645
and the second row of
air holes combusting

00:26:46.645 --> 00:26:49.020
all of those producer gases,
the gases that are given off

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.436
by the wood as it
breaks down the,

00:26:50.436 --> 00:26:52.197
that would otherwise
have just flown away

00:26:52.197 --> 00:26:53.280
and then blow in the wind.

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:56.065
These kind of things are
also called rocket stoves

00:26:56.065 --> 00:26:59.720
for perhaps obvious reasons.

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.800
If I take off the flue,
you can see how effective

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.930
this is at releasing
all of the energy that's

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:06.660
been locked up in the wood.

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:08.340
And we've zoomed
in now to the top.

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:11.070
You can see these jets
of flame coming in

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:12.510
from that upper
row of air holes,

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:16.050
where those producer gases are
combusted when you mix oxygen

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:18.410
with them again.

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:20.670
And this is exactly
the kind of technology,

00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:23.190
the appropriate technology,
or intermediate technology

00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:26.870
that has been touted around the
developing world by development

00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:29.730
agencies, because you can make
this kind of stuff yourself.

00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:31.620
It doesn't require
any high tech.

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:33.459
The fact that it's
smokeless means

00:27:33.459 --> 00:27:35.000
it's much, much
healthier for cooking

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.489
with in closed,
cramped conditions.

00:27:37.489 --> 00:27:39.030
And the fact that
it's very efficient

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:41.238
means it makes the most
effective use of the firewood

00:27:41.238 --> 00:27:43.080
the family can collect.

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:46.920
But what you can do is scale up
a gasifier stove from something

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:49.860
the size of a soup can,
like this, to something

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:55.250
the size of a trash can,
strap it to the back of a car.

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:58.590
And you can run a car
using wood as fuel

00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:00.950
rather than oil, or
gasoline, or diesel.

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:03.300
This is the gasifier
on the back.

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:05.290
And so the wood is
breaking down on the heat,

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:06.831
releasing those
producer gases, which

00:28:06.831 --> 00:28:09.740
are piped over the roof of
the car, down into the engine,

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:11.580
with a final ultimate
mix with oxygen

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:15.180
and explode usefully
to drive this car.

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:17.050
Now, I'll admit
to you, this does

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:20.050
look like some kind of crazy
steampunk post-apocalyptic Mad

00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:21.750
Max contraption.

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:23.490
But it works.

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:27.950
And this isn't just some
kind of fringe hobby.

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:32.890
During the Second World War and
all of the oil shortages back

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:35.740
then, there were over
a million gasifier

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:39.430
powered cars, wood powered
cars across Europe.

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:42.580
This is exactly the kind
of intermediate technology

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:45.750
you could stop the further
regression of your society

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:50.990
and start pulling yourself
back up by your own bootstraps.

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:53.090
If we turn to materials,
I've already shown

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:56.610
you the substances tree and how
you extract things like metal

00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:58.450
from the rock, from
ore, and how we've

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:00.020
done that through history.

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:02.020
But that's only going to
be half of the problem.

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:04.060
You've also got
to make something

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:05.730
useful out of that metal.

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:09.642
You've got to transform a
lump of metal into a tool.

00:29:09.642 --> 00:29:11.100
And what I was also
very, very keen

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:13.990
to do when I was researching
for the two or three

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:16.369
years of "The
Knowledge" project,

00:29:16.369 --> 00:29:18.160
I didn't want to just
sit down in libraries

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.118
and learn from books or
by interviewing people.

00:29:20.118 --> 00:29:23.199
I wanted to get some firsthand,
hands-on experience doing

00:29:23.199 --> 00:29:25.865
stuff for myself so I could then
write about it with experience.

00:29:25.865 --> 00:29:29.620
So I spent a day in a
traditional 16th century

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:31.690
blacksmith, an iron forge.

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:34.980
And when you think about it, the
kind of craft of the blacksmith

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:36.420
is really simple.

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:39.830
You take a big pile of fuel,
either charcoal or coke,

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:41.980
set fire to it, and
force air through it

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.720
with a set of bellows so
it gets really, really hot.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.130
You take your lump of metal
you want to start working on,

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:50.900
shove it on a hot place until
it gets very hot and then soft,

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:52.900
and then hit it with
another lump of metal which

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:55.160
is still cold, and
therefore, still very hard.

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:58.190
You use iron to work on iron.

00:29:58.190 --> 00:30:01.170
So I felt very smug with
myself after spending a day

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:04.490
bashing the hell out of this
bit of metal, this lump of iron

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:07.935
on a hammer and anvil
and made for myself

00:30:07.935 --> 00:30:11.020
a tool, made a knife, which
you can come up and have a look

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:14.160
at afterwards if you'd like.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:17.300
And the very first thing
I did when I got back home

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:19.580
was march straight
into the kitchen

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:21.950
and use the knife that
I'd made with my own hands

00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:25.290
to cut a loaf, cut some
cheese, and make myself

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:28.145
a post-apocalyptic grilled
cheese from scratch.

00:30:28.145 --> 00:30:30.740
I was absurdly smug with myself.

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:33.230
But if you look more closely,
either on the picture here

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:36.360
or by coming up and having a
look at the actual artifact,

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.790
I notice that there's
a ruinous crack where

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:41.210
the handle meets the blade.

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:44.814
I'd never had the guts to go
back and try my knife again.

00:30:44.814 --> 00:30:47.230
So I've actually done quite a
bad job of making this tool,

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:49.830
making this knife from scratch.

00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:52.490
But the important thing
is I know what went wrong.

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:55.640
I know how to go back and
have another try, another go,

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:56.530
and improve.

00:30:56.530 --> 00:30:59.180
And so as a
microcosm, this knife

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:02.555
represents how we have advanced
and progressed through history,

00:31:02.555 --> 00:31:05.320
through this reiterative
cycle of trial and error,

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:09.490
and applying your rationality
and critical thinking

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:11.530
to work out why
something has failed,

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:14.920
and therefore, improve upon
it next time to bug hunt

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:17.210
and fix those issues.

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:22.440
Within communication, the
kind of gateway technology,

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:25.646
the thing you'd want to
leapfrog immediately back to

00:31:25.646 --> 00:31:28.380
would be something like
the printing press,

00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:30.000
because before the
printing press,

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.380
if you wanted to
copy a document,

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:33.500
if you wanted to
share your ideas,

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:36.430
the only way of doing that would
be having a room full of people

00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:38.250
copying things out by hand.

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:40.530
This is enormously
time consuming,

00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:43.290
and laborious, and expensive.

00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:45.230
And that means that
only rich people

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:48.635
get to choose what ideas
are allowed to spread.

00:31:48.635 --> 00:31:51.010
But with the invention
of the printing press,

00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:53.420
knowledge itself,
human understanding

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:54.490
becomes democratized.

00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:58.100
Anyone can share any ideas
they want with everyone else.

00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:00.670
And that accelerates
not just technology

00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:03.570
and scientific discussion,
but political ideologies

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:05.120
and philosophies.

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:09.040
It accelerates many areas of
your society at the same time.

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:11.530
And this is exactly, again,
the kind of technology

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:14.320
you want to leapfrog
as quickly as possible

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:17.147
to help rebooting
your civilization.

00:32:17.147 --> 00:32:19.730
Now, another thing I was very,
very smug about when I realized

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:22.510
I could pull this off
was that within the pages

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:24.350
of "The Knowledge,"
I explain how

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:26.760
to make your own
paper from scratch.

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:28.940
I explain how to
make your own ink.

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:32.360
And I explain how to construct
a rudimentary printing press.

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:34.920
So it's almost as if, within
the pages of "The Knowledge,"

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:37.150
it contains the
genetic instructions

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:38.800
for its own reproduction.

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:42.780
Tongue in cheek, of course,
only one copy of this manual

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:44.590
would need to survive
the apocalypse.

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:46.880
And it tells people how
to reproduce it and then

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:49.090
hand out copies to
everyone that survived

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:50.220
and might need to know.

00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:52.520
And just as a proof
of principle, here's

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:54.480
a few pages of the
book-- the page

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:57.060
about how to build a
printing press printed

00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:59.950
on a rudimentary printing
press, on handmade paper.

00:32:59.950 --> 00:33:03.210
This is the proof of
the concept there.

00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:06.740
That's going to fall over.

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:11.520
The very final thing that
I was going to mention

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:12.670
was in advanced chemistry.

00:33:12.670 --> 00:33:15.130
And I've shown to you
the capabilities tree

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:18.030
of simple chemistry and
making things like soda,

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:20.620
and lime, or nitrates.

00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:23.360
But sooner or later,
as our civilization

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:26.840
encountered during our
history, you reach a threshold.

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:29.400
You cannot extract the things
you need out of a natural

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:32.690
environment quickly enough
to support your population.

00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:34.350
So you have to, at
that point, invent

00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:36.890
ways of making
artificial substances,

00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:40.330
making artificial soda like we
worked out in the early 1800s,

00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:42.403
or making artificial
nitrates like we worked out

00:33:42.403 --> 00:33:45.250
in the early 1900s to make
artificial fertilizer,

00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:47.270
and explosives, and gunpowder.

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:52.020
And that single chemical
reaction of the Haber process

00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:55.210
makes this foul-smelling
compound, ammonia,

00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:58.170
which is responsible for feeding
1/3 of the world's population

00:33:58.170 --> 00:33:58.670
today.

00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:00.900
It's that single
chemical step on which

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:04.840
I talk about in the
advanced chemistry chapter.

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:07.040
But I also talk about
the curious chemistry,

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:10.059
the light-responsive
chemistry of silver.

00:34:10.059 --> 00:34:12.600
And what I'm about to show you
is the most narcissistic slide

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:15.070
I've got in the entire
stack, because I

00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:18.620
wanted even the author's mug
shot on the back of the book

00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:20.820
to remain true to the
premise of the knowledge.

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:25.020
I wanted to make a photo
from scratch by myself.

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:27.500
So I went down to
Lacock Abbey in England

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:29.101
where photography was invented.

00:34:29.101 --> 00:34:30.600
The very first
photographic negative

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:33.630
was created in the
1830s and 1840s.

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:36.040
And I worked with
a historian there

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:39.230
to mix together the
very simple chemistry,

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:41.850
douse it onto a plate
of glass, load that

00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:45.929
into a primitive single lens
camera, and took this portrait.

00:34:45.929 --> 00:34:49.770
And believe me, this
took all day to get.

00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:51.090
Now, this isn't a snapshot.

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:53.670
That's a 16 second exposure.

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:55.750
And I would challenge
any one of you

00:34:55.750 --> 00:35:00.180
to sit absolutely dead
still, not allow your head

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:01.810
to twitch or move
in the slightest,

00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:05.526
or your facial muscles to
relax at all for 16 seconds

00:35:05.526 --> 00:35:07.150
to get a picture,
because if you don't,

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:09.835
if you move in the slightest,
your entire head blurs

00:35:09.835 --> 00:35:12.450
into this ghostly apparition.

00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:14.082
So that's why you
can't smile naturally

00:35:14.082 --> 00:35:15.582
in these simple
photographs, and you

00:35:15.582 --> 00:35:19.080
have to hold this almost
sneery, to be fair, but kind

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:21.690
of neutral, passive pose.

00:35:21.690 --> 00:35:24.500
And what you can't
see is that behind me,

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:28.220
there's a raw [? tie-in ?]
stand with a skull clamp locked

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:31.910
into the back of my head to
hold it absolutely still.

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:34.609
So I put it to you that the
reason all of our earliest

00:35:34.609 --> 00:35:36.400
photographs that have
had warring gentleman

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:40.174
and Victorian ladies, the
reason they looks of joyless

00:35:40.174 --> 00:35:41.590
isn't because they
didn't know how

00:35:41.590 --> 00:35:43.770
to have a good time back then.

00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:46.820
It's because they've had
to be sat and cannot smile,

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:48.906
and someone's jammed a
skull clamp into the back

00:35:48.906 --> 00:35:51.810
of the head.

00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:55.520
The way that we view history,
the way that we can see back

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:58.000
into time is distorted
by the technology that

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.960
was available at that moment
to capture that moment

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:02.070
and allow us to see it.

00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:06.110
It's a distortion of the
technology that we had.

00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:09.320
If any of this has been
of any interest to you,

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:11.360
there's a book that
you can get for $5.

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:13.860
But enormous amount of material
is up on the book's website,

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:16.620
on the-knowledge.org.

00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:18.540
There's lists of the best books.

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:21.140
You can read the best
post-apocalyptic sci-fi,

00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:23.525
books like "The Earth Abides,
or like "Robinson Crusoe"

00:36:23.525 --> 00:36:26.340
or "The Martian," which talk
about starting from scratch

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:30.394
and recovering through
the stages of capability.

00:36:30.394 --> 00:36:32.810
There's all the videos that
I've shown you short clips of.

00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:35.270
You can watch the whole four
minute video of how to start

00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:37.140
fires with different
combinations of things you can

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:38.955
scavenge around the house,
including how you can start

00:36:38.955 --> 00:36:41.431
a fire with a bottle of
water, which also is a quite

00:36:41.431 --> 00:36:43.930
[INAUDIBLE] [? that's cool. ?]
And there's also this article

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:46.350
all about Miley Cyrus.

00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:48.810
And this is another
thought experiment.

00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:51.230
Imagine you had a time machine.

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:52.630
You had a DeLorean.

00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:56.100
And you're going to go back
400 years into the past.

00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:57.870
What single
scientific instrument

00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:00.810
would you take with you that
could demonstrate or prove

00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:03.010
beyond doubt
something fundamental,

00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:06.200
some profound truth about
the world or the cosmos

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:09.012
that people just did
not believe back then?

00:37:09.012 --> 00:37:11.220
And what I would bundle into
the boot and my DeLorean

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:13.110
before going back
to the 1500s would

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:16.490
be Miley Cyrus, or at least
Miley and her wrecking ball.

00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:19.030
And I'd find a nice,
tall cathedral,

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:21.441
set up Miley nice
and comfortable

00:37:21.441 --> 00:37:23.190
like she seems to be
in the picture here--

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:26.590
she's having a whale of a time--
give her a jolly good shove,

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:30.370
and let her swing back and
forth on this pendulum.

00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:32.870
And if you watched Miley
during the course of the day,

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:35.570
you'd notice that she swung back
and forth, that pendulum seemed

00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:38.125
to twist over the ground.

00:37:38.125 --> 00:37:39.440
Now, there's no wind blowing.

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:43.110
There's no force causing
that pendulum to move.

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:45.370
So the only conclusion
you can come to

00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:48.420
is it's the entire
earth itself turning

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:50.190
under Miley as she swings.

00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:52.300
You can use nothing
more than Miley

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:55.530
to prove that the earth
is a big ball of rock,

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:57.610
and it turns on its own axis.

00:37:57.610 --> 00:37:59.620
The reason the sun seems
to arch across the sky

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:02.586
isn't because there's some fiery
god in a chariot dragging it

00:38:02.586 --> 00:38:03.085
around.

00:38:03.085 --> 00:38:06.370
It's because we're
stood on a sphere.

00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:08.810
And even better than
that, if Miley happens

00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:11.540
to have a wrist watch on as
you kidnap her and bundle her

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:14.450
into the boot of your DeLorean
to take her back to the 1500s,

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:16.810
you can use nothing
more than a wrist watch

00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:19.000
to prove beyond a
shadow of a doubt

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.250
that it is the earth that orbits
the sun, and not vice versa.

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:25.130
You can demonstrate the
heliocentric universe

00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:26.080
using Miley Cyrus.

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:28.960
Imagine all of the trouble
and strife that you could save

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:31.340
Copernicus and Galileo,
and all threats

00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:33.670
of being burned at the
stake, if only they'd

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:36.910
had Miley back in the 1500s.

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:38.810
So thanks so much,
guys, for listening

00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:41.180
so attentively and warmly.

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:44.330
We do still have maybe 10
minutes of time for questions.

00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:44.923
Thank you.

00:38:44.923 --> 00:38:47.821
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:49.027 --> 00:38:50.110
BORIS: Time for questions.

00:38:50.110 --> 00:38:51.611
We will use the
microphone please.

00:38:51.611 --> 00:38:53.610
AUDIENCE: First, I want
to say that this book is

00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:55.444
one of the best books
I've read in years.

00:38:55.444 --> 00:38:56.360
I absolutely loved it.

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:57.330
LEWIS DARTNELL: You
are a very kind person.

00:38:57.330 --> 00:38:59.163
Thank you for saying
that in the microphone.

00:38:59.163 --> 00:39:00.380
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:05.030
So I have two questions.

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:06.630
The first one is
one of the things

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:08.420
that I loved about
it is, as you said,

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:10.030
it ties everything together.

00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:12.080
And I found it just an
absolutely fascinating way

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:13.820
to look at education
in a way that would

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:15.300
make things more relevant.

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:18.020
And I was wondering if you had
any thoughts about how maybe

00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:20.660
you could apply this
book in schools or things

00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:23.120
like that to maybe get
people interested in things

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:24.828
they wouldn't otherwise
be interested in.

00:39:24.828 --> 00:39:27.040
Like chemistry for me, it
was a fabulous introduction

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:27.972
to chemistry.

00:39:27.972 --> 00:39:29.680
And then the second
thing I was wondering

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:33.380
is do you feel like there's
stuff you had to leave out

00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:34.390
or you forgot?

00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:37.090
And what would you
include if you had

00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:39.010
another book or more space to--

00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:39.725
LEWIS DARTNELL:
"The Knowledge 2.0."

00:39:39.725 --> 00:39:40.150
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:41.720
LEWIS DARTNELL: I suppose a
follow-on book would kind of

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:43.410
break the premise
of the first one.

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:46.202
You need this, but
also this one now.

00:39:46.202 --> 00:39:47.660
But your first part
about education

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:49.410
is a really good point,
and it's something

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:51.810
I'm very keen to try
and get off the ground.

00:39:51.810 --> 00:39:54.413
This is my very last day of
a month long tour of Canada

00:39:54.413 --> 00:39:56.470
and the US, touring the book.

00:39:56.470 --> 00:40:00.970
And I started off in Toronto
in University of Waterloo

00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:01.984
in Kitchener.

00:40:01.984 --> 00:40:03.650
And we're working
there to try and build

00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:06.772
a syllabus for undergraduates
or graduate studies

00:40:06.772 --> 00:40:08.730
basically on this, on
what are the fundamentals

00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:11.780
of civilization, and how would
you recover that capability?

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:13.359
How do things link together?

00:40:13.359 --> 00:40:14.400
But I think you're right.

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.055
I think it be just as
applicable, and interesting,

00:40:16.055 --> 00:40:18.180
and appropriate to
much younger children,

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:21.160
get it into secondary schools,
if not even primary schools,

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:24.200
just to open people's eyes
to the world around us

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:27.050
and how things work, and
how it all links together,

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:29.070
and what we take for granted.

00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:31.621
So if anyone here at Google has
got any contacts or any ways

00:40:31.621 --> 00:40:33.120
you might be able
to help with that,

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:35.780
please do ping me an email
or come up and say hello

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:36.990
afterwards.

00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:40.670
As for your second point
about what I missed out,

00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:42.410
I'm a scientist writing
a popular science

00:40:42.410 --> 00:40:44.410
book that will go on that
shelf in the bookshop.

00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:47.320
So I've focused on
science and technology.

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:49.110
And clearly, there's
more to building

00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:51.440
a stable society or a
technologically-advanced

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:53.660
civilization than
just knowing stuff.

00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:56.360
You need to have
good leadership.

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:58.330
And there's all of the
sociological factors,

00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:01.770
and a strong economy as
necessary for building steam

00:41:01.770 --> 00:41:04.340
engines, and factories,
as coal and the knowledge

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:06.500
of the gas laws.

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:08.800
So all of that is
quietly left out,

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.580
because it's a hard
thing to discuss

00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:12.320
the universals of
in the way that you

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:15.840
can discuss the universals
of science or technology.

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:18.590
You may notice that the
entirety of mathematics

00:41:18.590 --> 00:41:19.967
is slipped into
a single footnote

00:41:19.967 --> 00:41:21.800
at the bottom of the
page, where I basically

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:24.710
just cover my ass for not
having talked about mathematics.

00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:27.480
And that was actually
an editorial decision.

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:30.313
I had an entire chapter
planned out and half written

00:41:30.313 --> 00:41:32.146
about the most crucial
mathematics you need,

00:41:32.146 --> 00:41:33.630
because clearly you need
math to build bridges

00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:35.380
and then not have
things fall down on you.

00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:38.370
And there's good reasons
why geometry and algebra

00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:43.570
were developed by ancient
Egypt and Islamic cultures.

00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:45.070
But at the end of
the day, it's just

00:41:45.070 --> 00:41:47.060
you can't write about
math in the same you

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:51.430
can write about chemistry,
or technology, or biology.

00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:54.334
And I didn't want to have
basically a math textbook

00:41:54.334 --> 00:41:56.000
shoved in there where
I'm telling people

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.615
about the basics of
geometry and algebra.

00:41:57.615 --> 00:42:00.114
It wouldn't be fun to write,
and it wouldn't be fun to read.

00:42:00.114 --> 00:42:03.337
So I cheated, and just
didn't do any of it.

00:42:03.337 --> 00:42:05.420
AUDIENCE: A slightly
different thought experiment.

00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:09.320
You and 999 other people are
going on to a colony ship

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:10.480
into deep sleep.

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:12.970
You're going to land on what
you know is a Goldilocks plan.

00:42:12.970 --> 00:42:16.620
It has a comparable
composition to earth.

00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:18.700
You get to bring
whatever materials

00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:23.690
you want to provide a grace
period, and you get a book.

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:26.960
How different are those
materials and that book

00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:29.160
from this one and the
materials you mentioned,

00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:31.432
and what similarities
do they have?

00:42:31.432 --> 00:42:33.390
LEWIS DARTNELL: Yeah,
that is a great question,

00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:37.840
and I explain very early in the
introduction to "The Knowledge"

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:40.090
that although I've picked
the thought experiment to be

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:42.570
a post-apocalyptic
world, this is equally

00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:45.734
applicable to falling through
a time warp to 10,000 BC

00:42:45.734 --> 00:42:47.400
and wanting to make
yourself the emperor

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:49.733
and know everything you would
need to know to accelerate

00:42:49.733 --> 00:42:53.160
history, or crash landing
on a Goldilocks planet,

00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:55.540
on a [INAUDIBLE] world.

00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:58.720
And you would go through pretty
much exactly the same steps.

00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:00.500
And I've tried to
make the knowledge

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:02.916
to not peg itself to any one
particular kind of apocalypse

00:43:02.916 --> 00:43:04.350
or any particular
state, but to be

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:06.845
general in what it discusses.

00:43:06.845 --> 00:43:08.720
And I had some very
interesting conversations

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:11.900
with two NASA
researchers yesterday

00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:12.960
on exactly that question.

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:16.360
If we are sending ships
to Mars to build a colony,

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:19.660
what is the mutually
supporting set

00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:22.230
of tools you send
with them so they

00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:25.160
become self-sustaining
and self-supporting?

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:27.214
And how might mining
ore on Mars and trying

00:43:27.214 --> 00:43:29.630
to smelt the metals you need
be different doing it on Mars

00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:30.635
compared to Earth?

00:43:30.635 --> 00:43:32.000
And what are the similarities?

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.550
What are the differences?

00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:35.680
And I'm running through
that thought experiment

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:36.840
as well, as far as I can.

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:42.350
AUDIENCE: One thing I
don't see in the indexes

00:43:42.350 --> 00:43:44.450
on the topic of
the bootstrapping

00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:47.220
of mechanical precision,
how to build a surface

00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:50.060
plate from scratch,
and things from that.

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:51.342
Is that elsewhere?

00:43:51.342 --> 00:43:53.300
LEWIS DARTNELL: I touch
upon why it's important

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:55.300
and why the Industrial
Revolution wasn't

00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:57.480
just about knowing
about burning coal

00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:00.290
and about making pistons, but
being able to make pistons

00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:03.545
with the precision, enough
so it doesn't keep jamming

00:44:03.545 --> 00:44:05.070
and catching it.

00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:08.410
And I also talk about the
lathe and why the lathe

00:44:08.410 --> 00:44:11.896
is one of these-- like "The
Knowledge," which can reproduce

00:44:11.896 --> 00:44:13.770
itself, the lathe is a
machine which can also

00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:16.260
reproduce-- you can make
all the components for lathe

00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:17.135
using just one lathe.

00:44:17.135 --> 00:44:18.760
And in fact, even
better than that, you

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:21.210
can start making a lathe and
use your half-finished lathe

00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:23.470
to make all the rest of
the components you need.

00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:26.600
And there's an exquisite example
of that pulling yourself up

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:31.560
by your bootstraps by a series
of books by Dave Gingery.

00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:35.480
And he started with nothing
more than some sand, some clay,

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:39.960
and some old Coke cans or other
soda drink, some aluminum.

00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:43.780
And he made a back garden
furnace with a bucket

00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:46.240
and the clay in it, and
some kind of charcoal

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:48.450
he chocked in to melt
the cans, and then

00:44:48.450 --> 00:44:50.910
start pouring them to
sand to cast to start

00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:52.592
making components of a lathe.

00:44:52.592 --> 00:44:55.050
And once you've got a lathe,
you can make a milling machine

00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:56.660
and many other machine tools.

00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:59.595
So he built an
entire machine shop

00:44:59.595 --> 00:45:02.560
using some old tin cans
and some pile of clay

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:04.020
and a pile of sand.

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:06.560
And if you wanted to, you
can buy his series of books

00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:08.790
and do that process yourself.

00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:12.220
If you go to the
book's website, I've

00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:14.170
listed the entire
bibliography of that book,

00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:16.755
and every single
reference is hyperlinked.

00:45:16.755 --> 00:45:19.340
So you can go to either the
free PDF, or the website,

00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:23.870
or download it from Amazon
if you wanted to follow up.

00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:25.670
AUDIENCE: So I had
another question.

00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:28.860
So we are storing more and more
information electronically.

00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:31.260
At the moment, if we
run out of electricity,

00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:35.160
nobody can recover it from
a hard drive or a SSD drive.

00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:39.750
And our next best
medium is paper,

00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:42.650
which is very easy to destroy.

00:45:42.650 --> 00:45:45.170
And so how do we
preserve this storage?

00:45:45.170 --> 00:45:47.440
Do we print it?

00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:50.496
We haven't invented anything
better than printing paper.

00:45:50.496 --> 00:45:51.370
LEWIS DARTNELL: Yeah.

00:45:51.370 --> 00:45:54.980
So I talk about exactly that and
the kind of digital black hole

00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:57.250
in an article I wrote for
"The Guardian" newspaper

00:45:57.250 --> 00:45:58.950
two or three weeks
ago about what

00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:01.830
might be the optimum,
the best storage medium.

00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:04.160
And although you can get
an incredibly high density

00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:07.160
of information into electronic
storage, like a hard disk,

00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:12.670
or USB dongle, or whatever,
if you pick up USB dongle,

00:46:12.670 --> 00:46:14.510
it's basically closed
to you, unless you've

00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:16.640
got the computer, which
is running to read it off,

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:20.187
whereas something like a book is
very open access in that sense.

00:46:20.187 --> 00:46:21.770
All you need to be
able to do is read,

00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:23.300
and you can pick up the
book and you have access

00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:24.900
to the instrument inside it.

00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:27.640
And actually, acid free paper
is a pretty good storage medium.

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:30.055
It does last pretty well.

00:46:30.055 --> 00:46:32.990
But I guess if you really
want to take this seriously,

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:36.030
you would get some enormous
granite slabs and laser engrave

00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:37.910
them with everything
you need to know,

00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:40.250
or at least enough information
that you could bootstrap

00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:42.704
yourself to the next level
to then read a much denser

00:46:42.704 --> 00:46:45.120
store of information, and then
maybe use that to bootstrap

00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:46.310
yourself to the next level.

00:46:46.310 --> 00:46:47.893
And what I'm basically
describing here

00:46:47.893 --> 00:46:50.210
is Asimov's
foundation series, but

00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:51.580
on a post-apocalyptic world.

00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:53.600
AUDIENCE: So I have
one question, as well.

00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:56.620
So what if the survivors
are actually in China,

00:46:56.620 --> 00:46:59.250
and they don't speak English?

00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:01.501
LEWIS DARTNELL:
We're translating it.

00:47:01.501 --> 00:47:02.000
BORIS: OK.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.436
LEWIS DARTNELL: For
your flippant answer.

00:47:04.436 --> 00:47:05.939
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:05.939 --> 00:47:06.480
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:07.790
Thanks for this.

00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:11.690
So of course, the
post-apocalyptic world

00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:14.950
is a big topic in
fiction across all media.

00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:18.284
I'm curious if, a, you think
there's any examples out

00:47:18.284 --> 00:47:20.950
there where you think, wow, they
do a really good job with this.

00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:23.756
And also, b, whether you think
anyone, as far as you know,

00:47:23.756 --> 00:47:25.390
is using your book
as a resource to try

00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:30.220
to do a good job of
figuring out this world.

00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:33.872
LEWIS DARTNELL: I don't know
about the second question.

00:47:33.872 --> 00:47:35.580
I get a bunch of emails
a day from people

00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:36.900
that have read the book, and
found it very interesting

00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:39.090
and saying how they were trying
out some of the experiments,

00:47:39.090 --> 00:47:41.150
and things in their
back garden, or building

00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:44.750
a gasifier stove with their
kids before a camping trip.

00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:47.120
I don't know if anyone's
trying to rebuild

00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:50.600
their own society on a
desert island using the book.

00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:54.050
So I think most post-apocalyptic
films do a bad job.

00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:56.360
And it's mostly lone
heroes running around

00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:59.430
in leather, which is perhaps, a
little bit too tight and doing

00:47:59.430 --> 00:48:01.140
the Mad Max vibe.

00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:03.580
And clearly, that's
for dramatic tension.

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:06.140
It's more exciting to look at
people running around shooting

00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:09.230
each other for film than a
peaceful community trying

00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:13.360
to build a windmill out
of recycled car parts.

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:16.250
And books are always
much more nuanced

00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:18.590
in approaching complex issues.

00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:22.120
And again, if you
go under Prepare,

00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:24.350
that tab on the
website under Read,

00:48:24.350 --> 00:48:26.840
there's a list of
the best books which

00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:28.467
have approached these ideas.

00:48:28.467 --> 00:48:30.550
So things like "Robinson
Crusoe," or "Swiss Family

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:32.900
Robinson" deal with this.

00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:34.550
There's a more recent
book by Andy Weir

00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:38.640
called "The Martian," which
is basically a Robinson Crusoe

00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:41.350
meets MacGyver marooned
on Mars and has

00:48:41.350 --> 00:48:44.040
to work at how to not die and
start bootstrapping himself up

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:45.250
before the rescue mission.

00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:46.675
That is an incredibly good book.

00:48:46.675 --> 00:48:49.971
I did very much
enjoy "The Martian."

00:48:49.971 --> 00:48:52.012
There's a much earlier
book by Jules Verne called

00:48:52.012 --> 00:48:54.586
"The Mysterious
Island," which does

00:48:54.586 --> 00:48:56.835
a really good job of describing
the actual information

00:48:56.835 --> 00:48:58.690
and detail you
would need in a way

00:48:58.690 --> 00:49:00.520
that "Swiss Family
Robinson" brushed over.

00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:03.060
And it goes through how to
make different materials

00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:04.570
and the substances for yourself.

00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:08.630
So have a read at that, as well.

00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:10.200
AUDIENCE: One quick
question for you.

00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:13.559
If you did find yourself in
this post-apocalyptic world,

00:49:13.559 --> 00:49:15.350
and let's say you were
back home in the UK,

00:49:15.350 --> 00:49:18.580
or maybe you were in North
America, while there's still

00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:21.260
some transportation
that you could use,

00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:26.891
where would you go to settle
down and start a new world?

00:49:26.891 --> 00:49:28.390
LEWIS DARTNELL: I'm
not sure there's

00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:30.015
any particular place
on the planet that

00:49:30.015 --> 00:49:33.010
would be ideally suited
compared to anywhere else.

00:49:33.010 --> 00:49:35.450
Obviously, don't start trying
to rebuild civilization just

00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:37.479
outside Las Vegas in
the middle of a desert.

00:49:37.479 --> 00:49:39.770
Don't start trying to rebuild
society inside the Arctic

00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:40.380
Circle.

00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:42.885
Make things easy for
yourself and go somewhere

00:49:42.885 --> 00:49:44.510
within the temperate
zone of the planet

00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:47.060
where you've got reliable
rainfall, fertile soil,

00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:49.520
a river nearby, for all of
the same historical reasons

00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:51.260
that the early
civilizations began

00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:53.330
in exactly those environments.

00:49:53.330 --> 00:49:55.150
But the one bit of
advice I would give you

00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:57.700
is get out of the cities
as quickly as you can,

00:49:57.700 --> 00:49:59.990
not least for-- and I
don't ever say the zed word

00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:01.042
in the entire book.

00:50:01.042 --> 00:50:03.000
But if a lot of people
have died in the cities,

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.208
they become quite unpleasant.

00:50:04.208 --> 00:50:06.880
They smell bad, but they also
become a huge disease risk

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:07.680
to you.

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:10.520
But in the longer term,
when you think about it,

00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:14.200
a city is an absurdly
artificial bubble.

00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:17.059
And imagine trying to live in
a high rise apartment block

00:50:17.059 --> 00:50:19.100
without electricity running
the elevator and all.

00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:21.619
You have to schlep up 20
floors or flights of stairs

00:50:21.619 --> 00:50:22.660
to get to your apartment.

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:24.368
And every time you
want a drink of water,

00:50:24.368 --> 00:50:27.390
you have to lift up using your
own muscles with a long rope,

00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:30.090
a bucket to get water to you.

00:50:30.090 --> 00:50:32.460
And without water
pressure in the pipes

00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:34.530
delivering that water
or gas pressure,

00:50:34.530 --> 00:50:37.780
you can't really
live in a modern city

00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:40.730
without the life support
system that civilization

00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:41.790
provides for that city.

00:50:41.790 --> 00:50:43.290
So get out of the city.

00:50:43.290 --> 00:50:45.140
Find yourself a
nice, rural spot,

00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:47.120
with an old,
traditional house where

00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:49.630
there are fire places that
you can burn bits of tree

00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:53.250
in to keep yourself warm, and
a nice plot of fertile soil

00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:56.150
that you can start
rebuilding, and the beginnings

00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:57.670
of farming in.

00:50:57.670 --> 00:51:00.050
BORIS: Please join
me in thanking Lewis.
