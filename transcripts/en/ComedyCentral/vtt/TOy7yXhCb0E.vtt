00:00:01.735 --> 00:00:06.306
(APPLAUSE)

00:00:06.306 --> 00:00:08.108
IF YOU'RE TRAVELING AND DON'T

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:09.409
WANT TO STAY IN A HOTEL,

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:10.911
I RECOMMEND AIRBNB.

00:00:10.911 --> 00:00:12.179
YOU CAN ACTUALLY RENT OUT

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.780
A ROOM AT SOMEONE'S PLACE

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:14.882
OR RENT OUT...

00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:16.083
THIS ISN'T A COMMERCIAL FOR

00:00:16.083 --> 00:00:17.684
AIRBNB, BY THE WAY, BECAUSE A

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:18.886
LOT OF TIMES WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU

00:00:18.886 --> 00:00:20.153
GO TO RENT OUT A ROOM AND YOU

00:00:20.153 --> 00:00:21.522
FIND OUT, "OH, THIS IS NORMALLY

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:24.024
THE DOG'S BATHROOM AND I'M

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:25.292
PAYING HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS FOR

00:00:25.292 --> 00:00:26.426
IT."

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:28.061
BUT THEY HAVE VERY SPECIFIC

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:29.196
TITLES OF THE TYPE OF PLACE

00:00:29.196 --> 00:00:30.564
YOU'RE RENTING, LIKE THIS ONE:

00:00:30.564 --> 00:00:32.866
"HEATED GYPSY WAGON WITH HEART."

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.235
I THINK THEY MEAN AN ACTUAL

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:37.104
HEART IN THAT INSTANCE.

00:00:37.104 --> 00:00:39.006
COMEDIANS, I WANT YOU TO COME UP

00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:40.908
WITH LISTINGS FOR AIRBNB RENTALS

00:00:40.908 --> 00:00:42.676
THAT YOU WOULD NEVER WANT TO

00:00:42.676 --> 00:00:43.710
STAY AT.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.978
FOR EACH FUNNY LISTING, YOU GET

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:46.647
250 POINTS.

00:00:46.647 --> 00:00:48.282

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.354
&gt;&gt; Chris: WHY WOULD THEY NOT

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:55.422

00:01:10.204 --> 00:01:11.672

00:01:11.672 --> 00:01:13.073
SIGNED BY XAVIER ROBERTS, IT'S

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:14.741

00:01:48.408 --> 00:01:50.944
(LAUGHTER)

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:53.113
&gt;&gt; THEY GET SAD.

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:54.381

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:16.770
THAT IS THE END OF THAT ROUND.
