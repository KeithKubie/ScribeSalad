00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.090
MARTYN POLIAKOFF:
I'm a chemist.

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.740
And therefore, I suppose the
most obvious number for me to

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.100
talk about is Avogadro's
number.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.260
And Avogadro's number
is very big.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.940
Surprisingly, although I'm a
chemist, I can never remember

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.800
the exact value.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.890
So let me just look it up.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:28.190
It is 6.02214--

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.170
and there's some argument for
further decimal places--

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.850
times 10 to the 23.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.860
So this is a very,
very big number.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.890
And it is related to atoms
and molecules.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.330
So Avogadro was an Italian
chemist who worked at the

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.540
beginning of the 19th century.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.060
And shortly after John Dalton
had proposed the idea of

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.840
atoms, Avogadro was thinking
of the number of atoms and

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.160
molecules inside a flask
a bit like this one.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.590
So you imagine the
gas inside here.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.900
From those ideas, he developed
the hypothesis about the

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.805
number of molecules of any
gas inside a flask.

00:01:14.805 --> 00:01:18.640
But it's easier for me to
explain it to you with some

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.140
atoms here.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.850
So imagine that we have here
hydrogen; carbon, which is

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.980
black; oxygen; and uranium,
which is big.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.250
After the time of Avogadro,
people started measuring the

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.070
relative mass of these atoms.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.390
So hydrogen has a mass 1, carbon
12, oxygen 16, and

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.700
uranium 238.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.120
These are for particular
isotopes.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.850
These weights are defined by
the number of protons, the

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.590
positively charged particles,
and neutrons, the neutral

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.850
ones, in the nucleus.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.580
So for example, in carbon,
you have six

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.160
protons and six neutrons.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.490
Whereas in uranium, you
have 92 protons.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.800
And I can't work out the number
of neutrons, but they

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.950
add up to 238.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.810
I'll leave that for
you to calculate.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.480
Later chemists took Avogadro's
idea and developed it into the

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.430
statement that if you take 1
gram of hydrogen, 12 grams of

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:30.210
carbon, 16 grams of oxygen, or
238 grams of uranium, the

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:35.170
number of atoms in that sample
will be exactly the same.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.440
And that number was given the
name Avogadro's number in

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.940
honor of Avogadro, who started
thinking about these things in

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.190
the first place.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.640
BRADY HARAN: Professor,
is that fact a lovely

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.580
coincidence?

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.940
Or is that inevitable that
that would have happened

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.006
because of the way the weights
of atoms work?

00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:56.410
MARTYN POLIAKOFF: This
is inevitable.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.010
It's not a coincidence.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.100
It's not just like the number
of my birthday, December the

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.510
16th, is the same as
the mass of oxygen.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.750
It's something that's inevitably
true because of the

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.030
way that these mass scale
has been done.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.510
It is the relative masses
of the different atoms.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.440
The big question is, how can you
actually work out what the

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.460
number of these atoms are?

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.280
Because there's so
many of them.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.780
You can easily say that even a
simple experiment that you

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.620
could do at school or college
will tell you it's 6

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.210
times 10 to the 23.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.930
But it is the decimal points
and the numbers after the

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.020
decimal point that are
really the key.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.540
And the more numbers you can
measure, the more precisely

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.470
you know the number.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.410
Now, you can ask, what's the
point of measuring these

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.850
things so precisely?

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.390
Why do we want to know this
number so precisely?

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.780
And the reason is that it has
become very important in

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.550
recent years for the definition
of the unit of

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.060
mass, the kilogram.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.210
As you know, we have a whole
series of fundamental units--

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:21.779
the second, the meter, and
so on, the ampere.

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:27.320
So you can define most of
these units, such as the

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.330
meter, in terms of the
speed of light.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.590
But what do you use
for the kilogram?

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.270
Now, there's still
some argument.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.340
But one approach is to say if
we could define Avogadro's

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.750
number, then we could relate
that to the mass of carbon-12

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.740
or whatever.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.190
And then this would become
a fundamental constant.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.900
And we would no longer have to
rely on a lump of platinum or

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.270
iridium stored in a vault
to define what

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.780
we mean by a kilogram.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.030
The way that people are
approaching this is to measure

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.660
the mass of a lump of silicon.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.870
The reason they've
chosen silicon is

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.430
because it is an easy--

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.390
or relatively easy-- material
to handle and purify.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.900
So, they have made this
spherical lump.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.240
Imagine now this is a real ball,
about the size of the

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.790
one I'm holding, but made
out of silicon.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:33.790
And very special silicon,
the isotope silicon-28.

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.470
So that's just one isotope
of silicon.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.900
And they have grown a single
crystal of silicon-28 and then

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.370
machined it into a
spherical ball.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.730
And using this ball because you
can measure its diameter.

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:54.250
And you can measure, using
X-rays, the distance between

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.670
the layers of atoms.

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:59.130
You can calculate the number
of atoms in the ball.

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.270
You can't get the
nearest atom.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:06.240
But all being well, they may be
able to get to 1 part in 10

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.680
to the minus 8.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.590
That means, effectively, they
can measure the number or

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.520
calculate the number to nine
significant figures.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.450
That's 6 point and then
eight numbers.

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:24.770
And each of those digits, they
can be certain, is right.

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.100
BRADY HARAN: Still a long way
off the whole number.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.960
MARTYN POLIAKOFF: It's a long
way off, but it's near enough

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.700
to define the kilogram as
accurately as people want.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:38.770
It might be worth giving you an
idea how big 6 times 10 to

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.820
the 23 really is.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:47.400
And one of my friends, Colin
Johnson, has calculated--

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.820
and I haven't checked
his calculation--

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:55.040
that if you went round the
entire coast of the UK and on

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.340
every sandy beach used an
excavator to remove all the

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.730
sand to a depth of 1 meter.

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:06.980
And then you piled all that
sand up somewhere and then

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:11.120
counted the number of grains of
sand, it would be about 6

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.860
times 10 to the 23.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.560
So if you took a lump of
gold just slightly

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.950
less than 197 grams--

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:23.940
which, because gold's dense, is
not very big, probably much

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.400
smaller than any of
these balls--

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.450
in that lump there would be the
same number of atoms as in

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:34.850
this huge pile of sand that
you've got from excavating all

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.930
the beaches to a depth
of 1 meter.

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:40.450
So you get the idea.

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:41.870
It's a big number.

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:46.980
The other thing is that most
chemists don't use Avogadro's

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.620
number very often.

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:54.230
But what they do use is the unit
that is called a mole.

00:07:54.230 --> 00:08:01.260
And a mole is Avogadro's
number of molecules.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:06.790
And they talk about reactions
very often in terms of moles.

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:10.850
Now, some of you may know that
in English, and American

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:15.940
English, mole is the name of a
small, furry creature that

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.830
burrows under the ground.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:21.710
And in America, every year they
celebrate chemistry on

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.740
so-called Mole Day.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:26.530
And they have all sorts of
cartoon moles that tries to

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:30.980
make people enthusiastic
about chemistry.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.179
I appear on YouTube
quite frequently,

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:35.030
but not on this channel.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:38.429
But on Brady's other channel,
the chemistry channel, called

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:41.179
Periodic Table of Videos.

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:43.380
And we have a lot of fans.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:50.180
And last year, on Mole Day, a
fan in a school in Seattle

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.550
produced a mole.

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:57.420
She's called Melinda, and she's
in honors chemistry 3A.

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:58.720
BRADY HARAN: That's the
girl, not the mole.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.240
MARTYN POLIAKOFF: Yes.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:08.420
And she called this mole that
she made Moltyn Moliakoff.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:11.980
And I think it's rather sweet.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:15.500
And some of you who have a good
imagination may think

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.420
that there's a vague
resemblance between

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:19.710
the mole and me.

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:26.490
I think it's great that young
people, like Melinda, get so

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:30.560
enthusiastic about chemistry and
our channel that they make

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.010
models like this.

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:35.980
And I would encourage you, even
if you're a maths buff,

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:38.220
have a look at our chemistry
channel.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:41.570
Because chemistry is more
fun than you think.

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:44.102
And it has bigger explosions
than on maths.

00:09:44.102 --> 00:09:46.557
[EXPLOSION SOUND]

00:09:46.557 --> 00:09:52.985
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:52.985 --> 00:09:54.790
-Look at--

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:56.460
-I'm just going to check
that there's none left.
