00:00:00.542 --> 00:00:02.716
- [Voiceover] If and
initial investment, P,

00:00:02.716 --> 00:00:06.536
bears an inter, bears interest a rate, r.

00:00:06.536 --> 00:00:09.624
So this is initial investment
P, bears interest at a rate r.

00:00:09.624 --> 00:00:11.676
And is compounded annually,

00:00:11.676 --> 00:00:16.024
it's future value, A, after t years

00:00:16.024 --> 00:00:18.895
can be determined with the equation above.

00:00:19.092 --> 00:00:22.099
Which of the following equations
shows the interest rate

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:25.167
in terms of the future
value, initial investment,

00:00:25.167 --> 00:00:27.103
and number of years invested?

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.490
So they really just
want us to solve for r.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.521
So let's see if we can do that.

00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:35.235
So we have the future value.

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:36.515
Let me give myself some space.

00:00:36.515 --> 00:00:38.567
Future value is equal,
I'm just rewriting it,

00:00:38.567 --> 00:00:40.741
is equal to the initial investment

00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:44.154
times one plus r, interest rate.

00:00:45.134 --> 00:00:47.663
And then that quantity to the the t power.

00:00:48.144 --> 00:00:49.363
So let's see what we can do.

00:00:49.363 --> 00:00:51.070
So the first thing I can
do is I can get the P

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.366
onto the left hand side
by dividing both sides

00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:57.923
of this equation by
our initial investment.

00:00:58.587 --> 00:01:02.122
So if I do that, I get,
and actually let me,

00:01:02.122 --> 00:01:04.003
let me swap the sides, too.

00:01:04.003 --> 00:01:08.560
Then I get one plus r to the t power

00:01:08.716 --> 00:01:11.825
is equal to our future value,

00:01:11.825 --> 00:01:13.822
divided by our initial investment.

00:01:14.263 --> 00:01:17.438
Now how do I get rid of
this to the t power here?

00:01:17.575 --> 00:01:21.299
Well I could raise both sides
to the one over t power.

00:01:21.597 --> 00:01:26.597
So I could raise that to the
one over t power, one over t.

00:01:28.261 --> 00:01:29.460
If I do it on the left side, I have to

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.173
do it to the right side as well.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.763
So, on the left-hand side, if
I raise something to the t,

00:01:35.763 --> 00:01:37.389
and then I raise it to the one over t.

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:39.240
Remember if you raise
something to an exponent

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.764
and then raise it to another exponent,

00:01:40.764 --> 00:01:43.168
you're raising it to the
product of these two exponents.

00:01:43.548 --> 00:01:45.620
So this is equivalent to raising one.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.611
This is equivalent to
just raising one plus r

00:01:47.611 --> 00:01:50.110
to the first power, or this
is just going to simplify

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.139
to one plus r on the left hand side.

00:01:54.498 --> 00:01:56.693
And on the right hand
side, we're gonna have our

00:01:56.693 --> 00:01:59.598
future value divided by
our initial investment

00:01:59.598 --> 00:02:03.322
to the one over t power.

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:04.657
And now pretty straight forward.

00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:06.729
You wanna solve for r,
subtract one from both sides,

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.224
we get r is equal to our future value

00:02:10.224 --> 00:02:12.459
divided by our initial investment

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.650
to the one over t power minus one.

00:02:16.888 --> 00:02:20.998
And that is this choice right over there.
