00:00:00.275 --> 00:00:01.366
- [Voiceover] For someone who lives

00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:02.916
outside of the United Kingdom,

00:00:02.916 --> 00:00:06.997
the terms United Kingdom and
Great Britain and England

00:00:06.997 --> 00:00:09.174
often feel interchangeable,

00:00:09.174 --> 00:00:11.329
and they feel like they're
referring to the same thing,

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:12.967
but as we'll see in this video,

00:00:12.967 --> 00:00:17.007
they aren't referring to
exactly the same thing.

00:00:17.007 --> 00:00:19.146
So the United Kingdom
is actually short for

00:00:19.146 --> 00:00:23.226
the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and northern Ireland.

00:00:23.226 --> 00:00:26.887
So the United Kingdom
includes everything here,

00:00:26.887 --> 00:00:30.244
on the right, on the
island of Great Britain,

00:00:30.244 --> 00:00:32.130
so it includes all of that,

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.424
and it includes part of
the island of Ireland,

00:00:36.424 --> 00:00:39.450
it includes northern
Ireland, right over there.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.864
That is the United Kingdom,

00:00:41.864 --> 00:00:46.287
the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and northern Ireland.

00:00:46.287 --> 00:00:49.134
Now, what are they talking about

00:00:49.134 --> 00:00:50.793
when people say Great Britain,

00:00:50.793 --> 00:00:52.424
well they're just referring
to the large island,

00:00:52.424 --> 00:00:54.636
here on the right.

00:00:54.636 --> 00:00:55.959
And what about England?

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:58.876
Well, England is a
subset of Great Britain.

00:00:58.876 --> 00:01:02.534
England is this region
in this peachy color,

00:01:02.534 --> 00:01:05.142
right over here on the island,

00:01:05.142 --> 00:01:07.725
on the island of Great Britain.

00:01:08.596 --> 00:01:11.981
Now the reason why some people
will interchange these words

00:01:11.981 --> 00:01:14.289
is because London is in England,

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:17.832
it's the seat of power
for the United Kingdom.

00:01:17.832 --> 00:01:19.347
But there are other regions,

00:01:19.347 --> 00:01:21.754
and some people would even say nations,

00:01:21.754 --> 00:01:24.232
because the folks in these
regions, historically,

00:01:24.232 --> 00:01:27.556
have shared common traditions
and common dialects,

00:01:27.556 --> 00:01:30.152
sometimes bordering on common language,

00:01:30.152 --> 00:01:33.699
and the other regions, or
you could even say nations,

00:01:33.699 --> 00:01:36.982
of people who have a common
affinity, include the Welsh,

00:01:36.982 --> 00:01:41.513
and so, they are in Wales,
also part of Great Britain,

00:01:41.513 --> 00:01:43.133
which is part of the United Kingdom.

00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:45.699
You have the Scots, also,

00:01:45.699 --> 00:01:48.805
or the people who live in Scotland,

00:01:48.805 --> 00:01:51.055
also part of Great Britain,

00:01:52.202 --> 00:01:53.635
which is part of the United Kingdom.

00:01:53.635 --> 00:01:56.680
So that's Great Britain, and as we said,

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.231
the United Kingdom is
the United Kingdom of

00:01:58.231 --> 00:02:00.482
Great Britain and northern Ireland.

00:02:00.482 --> 00:02:04.524
So it also includes this, it
includes this northern part,

00:02:04.524 --> 00:02:07.846
right over here, of the island of Ireland.

00:02:07.846 --> 00:02:09.544
And so some of you might be saying,

00:02:09.544 --> 00:02:12.371
well what is right here in green,

00:02:12.371 --> 00:02:15.263
what is the rest of the island of Ireland?

00:02:15.263 --> 00:02:19.430
Well that is the Republic,
the Republic of Ireland.

00:02:22.551 --> 00:02:25.152
So hopefully that clarifies a little bit,

00:02:25.152 --> 00:02:26.665
the difference between the United Kingdom,

00:02:26.665 --> 00:02:29.996
which includes Wales, England, Scotland,

00:02:29.996 --> 00:02:32.625
and northern Ireland,
it's the United Kingdom

00:02:32.625 --> 00:02:35.084
of Great Britain and northern Ireland.

00:02:35.084 --> 00:02:36.717
The difference between
that, Great Britain,

00:02:36.717 --> 00:02:39.368
which is the large
island here on the right,

00:02:39.368 --> 00:02:42.504
England, which is a part of Great Britain,

00:02:42.504 --> 00:02:46.671
and the Republic of Ireland,
which we just talked about.
