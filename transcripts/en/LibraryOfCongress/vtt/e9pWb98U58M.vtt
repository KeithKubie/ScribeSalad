00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.710
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.330 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Keys: Brendan Wenzel
is an illustrator based in Brooklyn.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.040
He's a graduate of Pratt Institute.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.100
His books include Some
Pets, Some Bugs,

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.110
One Day in the Eucalyptus
Eucalyptus Tree and Beastly Babies.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.760
His latest book is They All Saw A
Cat which he wrote and illustrated.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.510
What a creative and visually
appealing way to remind us

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.060
that we each see the same
world in different ways.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.470
All of the images are wonderful so
it's hard for me to pick just one,

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.090
but I think my favorite is the bee.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.740
So if you haven't read the
book be sure you check it out.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.780
For those of you familiar
with Brendan's work,

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.380
which shows a clear love
for the natural world,

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.190
you will not be surprised to learn

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.760
that he is a committed
conservationist,

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.050
interested in preserving
threatened places and species,

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.750
especially in Southeast Asia.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.600
After his remarks Brendan will be
signing in book signing line 18,

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.300
which is down to your
right, starting at 12:30.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.510
And with that I'd like to
introduce Brendan Wenzel.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.270
[ Applause ]

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.030
&gt;&gt; Brendan Wenzel: Hey.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.330
Is my mic on?

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.630
Can everybody hear me?

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.930
How are you?

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.230
Let me just get situated.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.580
Thank you so much for coming.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.390
Thank you National Book
Festival for having me.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.150
Alright, I've got one
of these, let's see.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.530
I'm going to test drive, let's see.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.920
Is it working?

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.290
Well this is a strong start.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.940
Let me see, alright, okay.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.160
Okay. Hello everybody.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.610
So, before I began I have a
couple of cat related questions.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.790 position:56%
How many people here have a pet cat?

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.880
Okay, not that many actually.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.190
How many people have seen a
cat, maybe in their building,

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.460
at a friend's house, have had some
kind of relationship with a cat?

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.180
Okay, wonderful.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.000
So, here's where things get a
little bit more interesting.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.960
How many people here
think that cats are cute?

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.200
How many people think that
cats are kind of creepy,

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.820
slinking around, a
little mysterious?

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.600
Yeah. How many people
think that cats are boring?

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.990
And how many people think that
cats are really interesting?

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.790
Okay. So this is cool.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.060
We have you know, many
people in this audience

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.740
but everyone raised their
hands for different questions,

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.750
which means that we all
have had very different,

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.800
unique experiences with cats.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.750
Which means that when we see
cats we're all seeing them

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.630
in kind of, in different ways.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.930
And so this was something

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.150
that I thought was
really, really interesting.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.710
And so I wrote this book called
They All Saw A Cat about this idea

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.990
and about how different people
and different animals see cats

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.730
in very, very different ways.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.680
So before I talk about that I'd
like to tell you a little bit

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.520
about myself and about
why I make books.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.700
So the first thing to understand
is that I have loved animals

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.020
since I was like about this big.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.230
This is a picture of me at the
Bronx Zoo in New York City,

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.230 position:56%
probably at the age of 10 or 11, and
it was my favorite place at the time

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.250
and still really is
my favorite place.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.560
And surrounding this photograph you
can see all the magazines and books

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.260
that I loved at that time period.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.740
So National Geographic and
The Animals at Maple Hill Farm

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.280
by the Provensens and The Tales
of Uncle Remus illustrated

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.990
by Jerry Pinkney who's still
one of my favorite illustrators.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.430
And so when I started writing
and illustrating stories I had,

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.800
they were of course about animals.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.520
So this is my first book and it
was called The Frog and was all

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.280
about frogs and the
life cycle of frogs.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.250
And my second book was
called Land of the Little

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.110
and it was all about baby animals.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.770
And funnily enough when I
was published my second book

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.840
that I illustrated was
also about baby animals.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.200
You may not have heard of this
because at that point I was writing

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.900
under the name BS Wenzel
instead of Brendan Wenzel.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.980
When I got to art school I
also, I also drew animals.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.190
This is a piece from my
senior project at Pratt.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.940
And a friend of mine tried to
imagine the zoo of the future,

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.500
if we had traveled to other
planets and brought animals back.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.540
So this was called The
Fantastical Intergalactical Zoo.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.520
A couple years out of art
school I was doing nothing

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.630
that had anything to
do with animals.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.540
Both my wife Magdalene and I
were working in office buildings.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.620
And my only interaction with
anything that had anything to do

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.330
with the natural world
was coming home at night

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.790
and watching these wonderful
BBC wildlife documentaries

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.790
by David Attenborough, which I
was just consuming ravenously.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.010
So at one point I said
to my wife, you know,

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.310
we've got to get out of here.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.340
And she said yeah, we do, like
let's go see some actual animals.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.080
And so we devised this plan.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.400
If we could get to the
other side of the world,

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.650
a place like Melbourne Australia,

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.490
then essentially everywhere
else would more

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.190
or less be on the way home.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.600
And so we did.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.030 position:56%
We left the US and for like a number

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.230
of magical years I found
myself crossing paths

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.280
with all these really cool
creatures I've been learning

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.350 position:56%
about in these nature documentaries.

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.090
So the last shot was a kea,
which is a parrot in New Zealand.

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.980
This is a troop of macaques
grooming my wife in Bali.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.940
These are some wallabies.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:34.140 position:56%
This is a vine snake on my arm and
I'm making this face because I found

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.460
out that this vine snake
is just mildly poisonous,

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.340
which I was thrilled to realize.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.590
And everywhere, everywhere
we've travelled I always draw.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.250
And so I draw with everything
I can get my hands on.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.890
I draw with pencils.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.590
I draw with markers.

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.020
I paint with watercolors which
come with me everywhere I go.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.590
And I get to draw in
all kinds of cool places

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:05.990
like Christchurch New Zealand
or Ubud Bali or Tokyo Japan,

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.620
or on the streets of
Ho Chi Minh City.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.800
And it was in Ho Chi Minh
City in Vietnam that my wife

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.480
and I were having such a great time

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.170
that we decided to
stay for two years.

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:22.460
And so we spent two years living
in this really wonderful city

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.140
on the other side of the world.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:28.750
And spending out, spending time
in a place that was so different

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:33.030
from the country that we grew up
was wonderful for so many reasons.

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:38.050
But one of the greatest things was
seeing how just day to day life

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:41.500
in Vietnam challenged
to us in a great way

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.160
to reimagine our relationships
to everything that we found

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.700
that we're at one time familiar.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:52.470
So things like architecture
and etiquette and fashion

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:57.670
and language all needed
to be reimagined.

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:01.030
And we had this great opportunity
to step outside ourselves

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.200
and see the world from an
entirely different point of view.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.240 position:56%
And at the time I said this is, this
is so, I was expanding and I felt

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.700
like it was so valuable but,
but I wasn't quite sure how

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.000
to explore that in a book.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.020
What I did know how to do at the
time was continue to draw animals.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.920
So these are some, these
are images of gibbons

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.800
that I created in Thailand.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.800
And so I sketched animals
everywhere we went.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.880
And just like in the picture book
world, sketches became finals,

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.540
and they eventually turned into
this series, which was created

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.910
to illustrate both more common

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:43.050
but also lesser known
creatures of Southeast Asia.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:47.580
And I did this one, because I was
fascinated by these creatures,

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:51.420 position:56%
but also because I wanted to educate
myself about all the different

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:54.110
and new, and new animals
that I would find

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:57.690
in the steamy ecosystems
around our new home.

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:00.950 position:56%
This really wonderful thing happened

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:03.810
when I put these images
out into the world.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:08.280
They very quickly began
to connect me to people

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.040
who also felt the same
way about these creatures,

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.330
who were fascinated by them.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:17.190
And those were conservationists
and biologists.

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:20.990
And I was thrilled to find out
that they felt like there are,

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:24.100
there were plenty of places
that we could collaborate

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.080
and explore this enthusiasm
together.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:31.440
So this is a map that I worked
on with the San Veasna Center

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.960
in Cambodia and I also worked on it

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.690
with the Wildlife Conservation
Society,

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:37.540 position:56%
who has branches all over the world.

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:41.280
And this map was created to
highlight some of the less,

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.390
the less traveled areas
in Cambodia that are,

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.110
that are ecological hotspots.

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.240
And what we were hoping is
that maybe by creating a map

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.250
like this we could attract
tourist dollars to some

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:54.580
of the roads less traveled.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.590
Through a project like
this I was able to connect

00:08:56.590 --> 00:09:00.270
with the Wildlife Conservation
Society back home in the States.

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:05.380 position:56%
And in 2015 I was able to work on a
redesign of the Bronx Children's Zoo

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:09.060
with some of my heroes from
my childhood which was really,

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.650
really fantastic and overwhelming.

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:23.360
I think that one of the, one of
the questions that I confront again

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:27.310
and again being someone who is
passionate about both the arts

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:33.070
and conservation, is finding
ways to share my enthusiasm

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:38.920 position:56%
and my fascination with the
natural world with a wider audience.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.180
And it's one of the reasons that
I feel very grateful that I get

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.830
to work in picture books.

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:50.090
Because I feel like picture books
are just the absolute perfect

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:53.760
platform for diving
into some of these ideas

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.250 position:56%
in an interesting and expansive way.

00:09:56.250 --> 00:10:00.110
And so working in picture books
I've been able to collaborate

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:03.560
with all these fantastic
authors, like Angela Dieter Lizzie

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.290
and Ellen Jackson and
Daniel Bernstorm.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:10.240
And I've been able to get a glance
at how they see the natural world

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:17.090
and what inspires them about
animals and natural systems.

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:24.320
Just getting through
here, apologies.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:29.570
Sorry, it seems we're
caught up here.

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:39.340
Okay. Author, other authors
are not the only people whose,

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.050
whose viewpoints that
I'm interested in though.

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:42.860
And one of the great
things about working

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:45.130
in picture books is I've
had the chance to meet

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:47.150
and work with lots of kids.

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:51.780 position:56%
So these, these pictures are from
an art class that I taught in Nepal.

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:55.430
And you can kind of see these
fish tanks in the, in the picture.

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:59.490
And essentially these art classes
were held around these tanks

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:02.270
that were full of frogs and
insects and all these other animals

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:06.030
that we found around this
beautiful valley in Nepal.

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:11.030
One thing that I've heard
again and again in art class,

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:13.250
both in the States and abroad,

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:16.150
is a lot of kids saying
I've done a bad drawing.

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:19.060
I don't know if anybody has
ever, has ever said this

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.860
or ever felt this way, and
it's certainly something

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:24.980
that I've felt a number of times.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:28.030
But my philosophy is that doing
a bad drawing is really an

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:29.330
impossible idea.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.760
And every chance I get I
try to share this with kids.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.040
Because I think that when
you're doing a drawing,

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.610
even if it's a drawing where you
feel like you've made a mistake

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:42.770 position:56%
or you've not done everything
exactly the way you wanted to do it,

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:46.730
what you're ultimately doing
is sharing your point of view

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:50.430
or sharing your perspective with an
audience, with the outside world.

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:52.740
And so what you're,
what you're doing

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:57.490
for them is giving them a chance to
see something like a frog in a new

00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:01.760
and interesting way that maybe they
haven't thought about it before.

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.670
And so kind of adopting that line

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:07.340
of thinking a bad drawing
becomes an absolute impossibility.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:10.090
And I really, I really
like this idea

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:11.990
and I think it's very important.

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:14.220
And it's something, again, it's
something that I wanted to write

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:18.240
about and I wasn't quite
sure how to approach it.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:24.790
So a couple of years ago Magdalena
and I returned from living abroad.

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:28.720
We had lived in Vietnam and
we'd spent time also in Nepal.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:33.530
And I set up this little
studio and started pacing back

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:37.140
and forth thinking about what I
wanted to write about and what kind

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:39.240
of story I wanted to tell.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:44.690
And so I thought about
animals that I'd seen,

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:49.850 position:56%
and I thought about animals that had
seen me, and I thought about animals

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:54.550
that had chased me, and I thought
about animals who I'd loved

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:58.880 position:56%
like my cat Showcat in Vietnam, and
I thought about people that I'd met,

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:03.470
and I thought about art that I'd
seen, and I thought about art

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:05.080
that I made with people
that I had met.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.470
And then I was doing
a lot of thinking.

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:09.690
So I started thinking
about getting a snack.

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:13.680
And so I walked down to my kitchen
and then I was, I started thinking

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:14.990
about the mouse that
lives in my kitchen

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:17.970
because it had been using
my pantry as a rest room.

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:22.500
And so I started thinking about
getting a cat, like my parents

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:26.190
because my parents certainly
do not have a mouse problem.

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:29.900
And, but then I started thinking
about being in Nepal and walking

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:33.820
through tiger habitat on foot and
how vulnerable that made me feel.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:37.330
And I thought well maybe I feel
a similar way about a tiger

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:39.170
that a mouse feels about a cat.

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:40.830
And then I realized
that's not exactly right

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:44.820 position:56%
because a tiger usually wants to
eat deer where a cat very much wants

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:46.820
to eat mice all the time.

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:50.010
And so I went back to my studio
and I started thinking again,

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:51.310
which is always dangerous.

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:53.740
But eventually I wrote
down this line.

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:57.900 position:56%
And that line was the mice saw a cat
and the cat was a frightening cat.

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:01.650
And I thought it was
a little bit clunky.

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:05.040
So I did what an illustrator
does and I drew a picture.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.230
And so I drew this picture
of all these little mice

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:10.500
and they're running away from
this big kind of terrifying cat.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.540
And then I said okay,
now I'm going to try,

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:15.490
try my hand at writing this again.

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:17.950
And this time I said okay,
let's keep it to just one mouse.

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:19.500
We'll have it about the experience

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.410
between this one animal
and this cat.

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:25.060
And then I thought well
this, the frightening cat,

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:28.570
I mean that is clearly an image
of a very, very frightening cat.

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:30.240
And so I scratched that out as well

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.970
and then went back
to the drawing board.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:34.150
And I ended up with this.

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:37.640
And I, and I really liked it.

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:41.270
I said oh this is you know, the
text and the image are interacting

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:45.070
in exactly the way that I would,
that I was kind of hoping for.

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:49.250 position:56%
And I took a step back and started
thinking about all the other animals

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:53.400
that might see this cat
and how every animal

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:56.740
that would perceive this cat
would see it in their own way.

00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:01.060
And as I started to kind of take
on the character of this cat,

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:05.650
as these animals and open up
my art vein, and I went oh,

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:09.640
like a flea is not going to want
to use the same materials as a bee,

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:11.830
where a flea might
want to use something

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:15.460
like colored pencil to
communicate that cat.

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:18.200
Maybe a bee with its
compound eyes would,

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.530
would sort of use water color.

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:24.240
And maybe a snake sensing
heat would want

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.380
to use acrylic and loose crayon.

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:29.980
And so I had just a blast for
six months reading as much

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:33.080
as I could every night about each
of these animals and then waking

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:36.350
up the next day and kind
of adopting this character.

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:44.780
And then just trying to create
art as a snake, as a skunk.

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:47.110
So the result is this
book They All Saw A Cat.

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:52.200
And I think if I have time maybe
I'll have some kids come up

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.600 position:56%
and we can, we can read it together.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:58.320 position:56%
Would anybody like to come up on,
up on stage or we can read the book?

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:03.320
Let me just grab the
book really quickly.

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:06.310
Come on up guys.

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:08.070
How are you?

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:09.590
Nice to meet you.

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:12.690
You guys want to sit down here
and we'll read the book together?

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:15.530
Alright. I'm going to sit,
can I sit in this chair

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:18.620
so I just face outward
and then, alright.

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:20.300
And then you guys want
to come right in here.

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:25.050
Can we sit on the floor?

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:26.350
Alright. Wonderful.

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:27.910
Look at this.

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:32.290
How is everybody doing?

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:33.750
&gt;&gt; Good.

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:35.050
&gt;&gt; Brendan Wenzel: Good.

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:36.350
Thank you for coming up.

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:39.920
Alright. So, this is my book.

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:58.510
Alright, so this book is
called They All Saw A Cat.

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:00.810
These are the end papers.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.480
Alright. So, as we flip
through the book I'm hoping

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:08.800
that everybody can keep
their eyes on this collar

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.590
and on this bell, alright.

00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:11.890
We all see that?

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:14.980
We've got a red collar
and a bell, alright.

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:25.010
So, the cat walks through the world
with its whiskers, ears and paws.

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:27.420
And we have this cat, right.

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:30.210
Just walking through the world.

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:32.070
And the child saw a cat.

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:35.940
And so we see this cat and it's
a very, very cute cat, right.

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:41.150
It's fuzzy and it's friendly.

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:44.260
And the dog saw the cat.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:48.450
What's happening to the cat?

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:51.610
Yeah, he's looking a little
bit creepier here huh.

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:56.850
And the fox saw a cat.

00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:59.200
Yes, they all saw the cat.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:08.960
The cat walked through the world
with its whiskers, ears and paws.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:18.510
And the fish saw a cat.

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:21.180
And the mouse saw a cat.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:27.040
Where is the mouse,
it's right down here.

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.740
And the bee saw the cat.

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:34.020
Yes, they all saw the cat.

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:37.730
Can you guys imagine what
it's like to be a bee?

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:40.170
Buzz, exactly.

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:43.910
The cat walked through the world
with its whiskers, ears and paws.

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:52.280
And the bird saw a cat
up above the clouds.

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.500
And there are five animals
hiding in this page.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:55.800
Can anybody see one of the animals?

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.250
We'll just do one, there we go.

00:18:58.250 --> 00:18:59.810
Can anybody find the bird eggs.

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:02.790
There's a bird egg
somewhere in here.

00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:05.160
There you go, there they are.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.460
Wonderful.

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:10.750
And the flea saw a cat.

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:15.860
And the snake saw a cat.

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:19.980
And the skunk saw a cat.

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:24.980
And the worm saw a cat.

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:30.090
And the, and the bat saw a cat.

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:33.290
Yes, they all saw the cat.

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:36.270
Yes, they all saw a cat.

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:39.070
And what's happening here?

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:41.890
This cat is made up of all the
different ways that we've seen

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:47.000
that cat throughout the book.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.590
A child and a dog and a fox and
a fish, and a mouse and a bee

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:55.510
and a bird and a flea, and a snake
and a skunk and a worm and a bat,

00:19:55.510 --> 00:20:02.430
the cat knew them all,
and they all knew the cat.

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:06.140 position:56%
And the cat walked through the world
with its whiskers, ears and paws,

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:08.440
then it came to the water.

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:15.860
And imagine what it saw.

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:18.790
What's it see?

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:25.590
Alright. So, like I said before, to
make this book every day I woke up

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:28.150
and I imagined I was
a different animal.

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:31.380
So what I'm hoping is that maybe
you guys one want to imagine

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:33.120
that you're an animal
with me right now.

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.120
Do you guys want to do that?

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.420
Alright, cool.

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:38.190
So let's come, well you guys
can sit here and I'm going to go

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:40.650
over to this drawing board and what
we're going to do is we're going

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:43.480
to imagine that we're
transforming into bats.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.200
You guys can sit right here,
you can sit right here.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.500
Can you see me from over here?

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.490
Alright. Alright.

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:52.840
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to draw on this board,

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.250
and we're going to turn
into bats together,

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:56.550
and I'll tell you how to do that.

00:20:56.550 --> 00:21:02.000
And so as I draw I'm going to
transform a kid into a bat.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.060
But what I want you
guys to do is imagine

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:06.860
that you're transforming
just like that kid into a bat

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:08.160
and we're going to become bats.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.460
Does that sound fun?

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:12.600
Alright. So we're going
to start, excuse me.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:14.140
Alright. So we're going
to start with a kid.

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:16.070
Here we go.

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:20.830
So we got our body,
right, we've got a body.

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:23.130
Do a head.

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:28.160
Got some eyes right,
what's here, what are these?

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.480
Arms, there we go, alright.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:33.550
What comes at the end of arms?

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:35.360
Fingers, right, five fingers.

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:40.700
And then down here.

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:47.420
Okay. So we've got our human child.

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:51.700
Now let's start with our body.

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:54.000
So human beings have
a smooth body, right.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.230
But bats are covered in
something and it keeps them,

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:58.190
it keeps them warm and
night when they fly around.

00:21:58.190 --> 00:21:59.730
Does anyone know what it is?

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:01.030
What is it?

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:02.460
It's fur, alright.

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:05.410
So I'm going to draw some fur
over here and what I want you guys

00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:08.650
to do is imagine growing
furry fur all over you, okay.

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:12.070
And this is going to, and for a
bat this is going to keep you warm

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:13.970
because you're flying around
and it's called a night, right.

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:16.050
And it's going to get
cold in that cave

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:18.410
where you're probably
sleeping all day.

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:22.030
Alright. So now we've
got our bat fur.

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:24.110
Has everybody grown bat fur?

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:27.010
Yeah, yeah, there you go.

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:28.950
Alright, alright.

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:30.440
Now let's go to our legs.

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.600
Alright, so we've got these long
people legs, but we're not going

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.270
to need those long
legs as a bat, right.

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:36.790
We're going to need little
tiny legs but what we're going

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:40.760
to need is long, long toes so
we can hang on to that branch.

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.060 position:56%
So I'm going to draw little bat legs

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:44.120
and everyone imagine
their legs shrinking down

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:47.000
and those toes getting really long.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.590
Alright, here we go.

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:50.870
Everybody grown bat legs?

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:54.080
Alright. Yeah, alright.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:58.540 position:56%
And then we'll do a little bat tail.

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:01.990
Alright. Now does a bat have arms?

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:03.450
What does a bat have?

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:04.750
Wings, that's right.

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:06.050
So this is the fun part.

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:11.040
So I want everybody to imagine
growing big long bat wings, ready.

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:18.430
Those fingers are stretching out
and becoming really big bat wings.

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:19.770
How you guys doing, are
you growing those wings?

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:21.630
Are you flapping around,
everybody flapping?

00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:23.930
There we go.

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:30.260
Alright. And then we've got
one last adjustment to make,

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:33.450
and that's up here, because
we've got our ears on our side

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:35.400
of the head, where
are the bat's ears?

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.810
Where does the bat have ears?

00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:38.110
Up here on the top, right.

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:41.130
Alright. So let's give us
some big, big bat ears.

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:43.430
Wow, alright.

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:46.930
That's a bat.

00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:48.240
Alright. Alright.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:24:03.230
And then the last, the last step
is now that we're bats we've got

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:09.040
to shrink way way way way way way
down so we become tiny little bats.

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:13.290
Alright. Now, here is your mission.

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:16.300
Now you have to go home
today as bats, okay.

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:20.820
And when you get home I want you
to think, how do I see the world?

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:24.140
How am I going to, how am I
going to see the world around me?

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:27.140
And what you can do is you can go
I don't know anything about bats,

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:30.860
maybe you can go to the library
and you can read as much as you can

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:32.780
about how those bats see the world.

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:36.860
And then you can make a
piece of artwork as a bat.

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:39.870
And you guys all might want to
make a piece of artwork as a bat

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:41.630
with different materials.

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:44.510
You might see it, see the world
in entirely different ways.

00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:45.820
Does that make sense?

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:47.400
Does that sound fun?

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.290
And so what I'm hoping is
that when you read this book,

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:51.890
when you read They All Saw
A Cat you can go through

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:55.940
and imagine how every one of those
animals see the, sees the world.

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:58.820 position:56%
And maybe you'll look at how I think
these animals see the world and go,

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:00.530 position:56%
I don't think that was right at all.

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:02.390
I think animals see
the world like this.

00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:03.780
I think animals see
the world like that.

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:06.270
And that's my, that's my
greatest hope for this book is

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:09.380
that you guys will take it back
and have lots and lots of questions

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:11.180
about the book and the world

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:14.440
and about how different
things see this one cat.

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:17.510
So anyway, thank you so much
for coming and listening.

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:21.360
