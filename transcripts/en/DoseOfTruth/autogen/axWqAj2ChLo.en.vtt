west towards the Saudis that stems from
 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.500
west towards the Saudis that stems from
perhaps events that were as far back as

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510
perhaps events that were as far back as
 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.659
perhaps events that were as far back as
a hundred years ago and the

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669
a hundred years ago and the
 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.760
a hundred years ago and the
paternalistic aspect is too

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770
paternalistic aspect is too
 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.610

underestimate them as enemies right

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620
underestimate them as enemies right
 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.140
underestimate them as enemies right
because you say well we could say well

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150
because you say well we could say well
 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.219
because you say well we could say well
we need the oil and we're gonna

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229
we need the oil and we're gonna
 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.589
we need the oil and we're gonna
stabilize it and maybe that we'd rather

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:33.599
stabilize it and maybe that we'd rather
 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:35.869
stabilize it and maybe that we'd rather
not have chaos in Saudi Arabia and so a

00:04:35.869 --> 00:04:35.879
not have chaos in Saudi Arabia and so a
 

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:37.820
not have chaos in Saudi Arabia and so a
known dictator is better than unknown

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830
known dictator is better than unknown
 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.550
known dictator is better than unknown
chaos and I mean we saw some proof of

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560
chaos and I mean we saw some proof of
 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.409
chaos and I mean we saw some proof of
that perhaps in what happened with Libya

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419
that perhaps in what happened with Libya
 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:45.409
that perhaps in what happened with Libya
but so the idea would be there's nothing

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419
but so the idea would be there's nothing
 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.570
but so the idea would be there's nothing
sufficiently dangerous about the Saudis

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580
sufficiently dangerous about the Saudis
 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.210
sufficiently dangerous about the Saudis
to justify us destabilizing their regime

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220
to justify us destabilizing their regime
 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.740
to justify us destabilizing their regime
especially when we're particularly

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750
especially when we're particularly
 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.779
especially when we're particularly
dependent on their oil and then

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789
dependent on their oil and then
 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:55.249
dependent on their oil and then
underneath that would be an

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:55.259
underneath that would be an
 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:57.740
underneath that would be an
underestimation of the danger of ideas

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750
underestimation of the danger of ideas
 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.779
underestimation of the danger of ideas
and also especially when ideas are

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789
and also especially when ideas are
 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:01.460
and also especially when ideas are
combined with money it's something like

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470
combined with money it's something like
 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.189
combined with money it's something like
that so yeah because the Saudis in some

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199
that so yeah because the Saudis in some
 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:05.960
that so yeah because the Saudis in some
sense I think are fighting what you

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970
sense I think are fighting what you
 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.059
sense I think are fighting what you
might regard as a stealth war against

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:08.069
might regard as a stealth war against
 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:10.100

the West and they're doing it by

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110
the West and they're doing it by
 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.430
the West and they're doing it by
convincing upcoming generations of the

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440
convincing upcoming generations of the
 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.839
convincing upcoming generations of the
rightness of their particular viewpoint

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:14.849
rightness of their particular viewpoint
 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:16.640
rightness of their particular viewpoint
and so they're in it for the long haul

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650
and so they're in it for the long haul
 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.290
and so they're in it for the long haul
in some sense and I think we're

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300
in some sense and I think we're
 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.059
in some sense and I think we're
radically under estimating the danger of

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:20.069
radically under estimating the danger of
 

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:27.830
radically under estimating the danger of
that and we're not yeah I mean you have

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840
that and we're not yeah I mean you have
 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.570
that and we're not yeah I mean you have
to think of when the Soviet Union was

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580
to think of when the Soviet Union was
 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.939
to think of when the Soviet Union was
around if we hadn't done anything in

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:31.949
around if we hadn't done anything in
 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:34.040
around if we hadn't done anything in
response if we had only viewed that in

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050
response if we had only viewed that in
 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.170
response if we had only viewed that in
economic terms or in military terms yeah

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180
economic terms or in military terms yeah
 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.020
economic terms or in military terms yeah
