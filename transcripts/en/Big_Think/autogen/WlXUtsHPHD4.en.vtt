00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.440
 
I looked at a number of cases of groups

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:07.450
I looked at a number of cases of groups
 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.720
I looked at a number of cases of groups
being in very demanding circumstances I

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:09.730
being in very demanding circumstances I
 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.730
being in very demanding circumstances I
looked at a sample of shipwrecks for

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:11.740
looked at a sample of shipwrecks for
 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.150

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.770
people stranded for two or more months
on isolated shores I looked at the

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:19.780
on isolated shores I looked at the
 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.630
on isolated shores I looked at the
Shackleton expedition I looked at the

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640
Shackleton expedition I looked at the
 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.550
Shackleton expedition I looked at the
mutiny on the bounty and the Pitcairn

Island errs I've looked at groups of

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380
Island errs I've looked at groups of
 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.920
Island errs I've looked at groups of
scientists that were self isolated in in

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:28.930
scientists that were self isolated in in
 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.770

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809
own I've looked at all of these there
 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:37.260

and more types of groups of people and

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.270
and more types of groups of people and
 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.180

the role that leadership might play in

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190
the role that leadership might play in
 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.190
the role that leadership might play in
them and how natural selection may have

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200
them and how natural selection may have
 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.280
them and how natural selection may have
shaped our desire for leadership and our

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290
shaped our desire for leadership and our
 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.130
shaped our desire for leadership and our
capacity for leadership I've also looked

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140
capacity for leadership I've also looked
 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.680
capacity for leadership I've also looked
at evidence done by other scientists on

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690
at evidence done by other scientists on
 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.840
at evidence done by other scientists on
primate groups in the role of leadership

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850
primate groups in the role of leadership
 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.270
primate groups in the role of leadership
in primate groups including experiments

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280
in primate groups including experiments
 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.860
in primate groups including experiments
in which the primate the leading

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870
in which the primate the leading
 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.420
in which the primate the leading
primates were experimentally removed

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430
primates were experimentally removed
 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.190
primates were experimentally removed
from the group to see how the group

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200
from the group to see how the group
 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.350
from the group to see how the group
functioned after removal of the leader

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360
functioned after removal of the leader
 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.049
functioned after removal of the leader
and all of this evidence tends towards a

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059
and all of this evidence tends towards a
 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.969
and all of this evidence tends towards a
set of conclusions one of which is that

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979
set of conclusions one of which is that
 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.539
set of conclusions one of which is that
human beings are equipped for and prefer

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.319
autocratic or are too able to impose
punishment on ourselves and there's a

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:19.329
punishment on ourselves and there's a
 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:20.639
punishment on ourselves and there's a
lot of evidence that in ancient times

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649
lot of evidence that in ancient times
 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:23.039
lot of evidence that in ancient times
what human beings did in those types of

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049
what human beings did in those types of
 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.199
what human beings did in those types of
circumstances is that the lower guys on

00:01:25.199 --> 00:01:25.209
circumstances is that the lower guys on
 

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:27.359
circumstances is that the lower guys on
the totem pole kind of bonded together

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369
the totem pole kind of bonded together
 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.179
the totem pole kind of bonded together
to kill a person who was too violent or

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189
to kill a person who was too violent or
 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.639

peaceful in part by weeding out those
 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.469
peaceful in part by weeding out those
among us that were too autocratic

among us that were too autocratic
 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.139

instance looks at the the role of
inequality even in forager groups so

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750
inequality even in forager groups so
 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.030

about zero point two among forager

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870
about zero point two among forager
 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.140
about zero point two among forager
populations it's about zero point one to

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150
populations it's about zero point one to
 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.530
populations it's about zero point one to
approximately it's not zero so even in

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540
approximately it's not zero so even in
 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.320
approximately it's not zero so even in
forager populations there's some natural

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330
forager populations there's some natural
 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.120
forager populations there's some natural
inequality that's that's present and

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130
inequality that's that's present and
 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.400
inequality that's that's present and
furthermore when you look at forager

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410
furthermore when you look at forager
 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.340
furthermore when you look at forager
populations forager populations have

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350

other ways of communicating hierarchy
 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.160
other ways of communicating hierarchy
and status so what what what human

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170
and status so what what what human
 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.430
and status so what what what human
beings care about is not just status but

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440
beings care about is not just status but
 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.650
beings care about is not just status but
we also care about prestige so we don't

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660
we also care about prestige so we don't
 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.180
we also care about prestige so we don't
just care about individuals who are

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190
just care about individuals who are
 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.699
just care about individuals who are
powerful we care about individuals who

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709
powerful we care about individuals who
 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.650
powerful we care about individuals who
have prestige because they are

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660
have prestige because they are
 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.840
have prestige because they are
knowledgeable so the argument goes that

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850
knowledgeable so the argument goes that
 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.310
