00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.719
There is a lot of pressure that comes along
with being famous.

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.660
And existing in the public eye 24/7 can take
its toll on even the most level-headed entertainers.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.949
Especially if they’re tied to a hugely successful
franchise.

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:21.610
Constant interruptions and autograph requests
can get tiresome, but most people argue that’s

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:22.610
just part of the job.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.060
And as with all jobs, some people are just
better at it than others.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.130
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Actors Who Are
Terrible To Their Fans.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.680
Christian Bale
Christian Bale avoids the spotlight as much

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.280
as possible when he’s not working.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.820
And has said that he aims to maintain a boundary
between his professional life and his private

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:38.820
one.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.850
But that’s pretty hard to do once everyone
knows you’re Batman.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.449
Even harder after someone claiming to be your
ex-publicist writes a tell-all book about

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:45.890
what a jerk you supposedly are.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:46.890
And that’s exactly what happened.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.739
The book claims that when the actor was approached
by some young fans at a restaurant, they left

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:50.969
his table in tears.

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.659
Apparently having received a harsh lecture
about manners.

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:58.559
And again we are reminded that Christian Bale
does not like to be interrupted.

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.569
Ewan McGregor
For an actor, being cast in a Star Wars movie

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:03.760
should feel like an honor, because it is.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.010
The franchise has a gigantic following worldwide,
and it’s a great opportunity to perform

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.530
in front of millions of people.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.470
So when Ewan McGregor was given the chance
to play young Obi-Wan Kenobi, he took it.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.350
The films received a ton of attention and,
understandably, the actor was suddenly bombarded

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.250
by people who wanted his autograph.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.540
When he was asked about his relationship with
the Star Wars audience, McGregor said that

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.440
he hadn’t met any fans, only “wankers”
looking to make money by selling his signature

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.440
on the internet.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.730
He explained that his issue is with people
who take advantage of the franchise’s fans

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:31.730
in this way.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.910
Still though, if there were any real fans
mixed in with the “wankers” he’s referring

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.350
to, they’re probably pretty devastated.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.740
Robert Pattinson
If you’re going to sign on to a five movie

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.180
franchise, it’s a good idea to make sure
you enjoy playing your character.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.210
Because you’re going to be spending a lot
of time in their shoes.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.540
But this is something Robert Pattinson completely
overlooked when he agreed to play the big

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.330
screen version of Edward, hunky vampire from
the Twilight book series.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.050
The movies were incredibly successful, and
brought in over three billion dollars worldwide.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.900
A lot of that is thanks to a loyal fanbase
who followed the story from book to screen.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.130
But when the actor took a look at the first
book in preparation, he said it read like

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.620
something that got written by a crazy person
and published by mistake.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.010
As a further blow to Team Edward, Pattinson
has also talked about how much he disliked

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.910
the character- and compared the sparkly vamp
with an axe murderer.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.280
Oh, and the nickname “R-Patz”?

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.140
He hates that too.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.770
Simon Pegg
With multiple franchises under his belt, the

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.370
lovable Simon Pegg has become a household
name.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.569
And when he took the role as Scotty in Star
Trek, people were psyched.

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.420
The second film, Star Trek Into Darkness,
wasn’t as well received as the first.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.810
When some Trekkies left the theatre unimpressed,
they did what most people do: took to the

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:31.810
internet.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.610
Asserting that the movies were straying too
far outside the canon, an online poll was

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.709
created and Into Darkness was voted the worst
Star Trek movie of all time.

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.950
Ignoring the fact that the participant pool
was probably biased, reporters brought it

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.450
up in countless interviews.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.610
And Simon Pegg was tired of hearing about
it.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.730
The actor argued that people who didn’t
like the movie only felt that way because

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.359
it was no longer exclusive to a niche market-
not because it was bad.

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:57.340
Finally, he ended his response with a big
“fuck you” to the haters.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.900
Jesse Eisenberg
Have you ever said something that you tried

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:00.900
to take back?

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.459
A comment that only sounded worse the more
you tried to explain it?

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:04.689
Jesse Eisenberg has.

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:08.999
During promotion for Batman v Superman: Dawn
of Justice, the actor swung by Comic Con.

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:12.319
The convention is a place where fans from
all over the world meet to get up close and

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.219
personal with their favorite heroes.

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:18.110
Usually everyone involved has a positive experience,
but Eisenberg couldn’t wait to get the hell

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.110
out of there.

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.569
In an interview afterward, he compared Comic
Con to a “genocide”.

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.529
And after someone pointed out how offensive
that was, he tried to backpedal.

00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:29.620
Explaining that his senses were being overloaded,
he was scared by the fans, and that he had

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.560
used hyperbole to get his point across.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.920
No apology though.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.650
Shia LaBeouf
Somewhere between Louis Stevens and now, Shia

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.110
LaBeouf started acting a little wacky.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.269
And thanks to social media, everyone can talk
about it instantly.

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.659
There have been reports of the actor picking
fights with fans, then threatening to pull

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:46.150
a knife on anyone who intervenes.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.079
He’s been carted away by the cops on more
than one occasion, and has had public arguments

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:51.549
with girlfriends in the past.

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:54.939
Some people are wondering if it’s all an
elaborate joke or symptoms of something more

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:55.939
serious.

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:59.169
Fellow actor James Franco has written about
LaBeouf, saying he wasn’t sure if his behavior

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:02.040
was part of an art project, or the result
of a nervous breakdown.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.650
Either way, he encouraged the actor not to
use up all the good he’s built with fans.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.779
Gwyneth Paltrow
Gwyneth Paltrow was born into a successful

00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:17.370
Hollywood family, and had access to a lot
of opportunities that most of us could only

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.370
dream of.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:28.300
So when she claimed that her work-life balance
as a mother was harder to maintain than “regular

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.570
moms”, more than a few eyebrows were raised
in response.

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.640
The so-called regular moms were shocked at
how flippantly condescending Paltrow’s follow-up

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.120
remarks were to working mothers everywhere.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.100
Maybe the starlet’s sheltered life really
has disconnected her from the realities facing

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.650
modern parents, but she’s not apologizing.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.970
In fact, the actress responded in a post on
her blog, and chided the protesters for “projecting

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.610
their issues” on to her.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.250
Some people just don’t know how to apologize.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.070
Alec Guinness
It seems the Obi-Wan Kenobis of the world

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.450
are kind of a grumpy bunch.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.760
And one legendary tale regarding the actor
who played him has been circulating for years.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.620
The story- detailed in Alec Guinness’ book-
says that a young fan and his mom approached

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.160
the actor and when the child told Obi-Wan
that he’d seen the movie over a hundred

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.010
times, Guinness made him promise to never
watch it again.

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.790
Guinness’ version has the story ending with
the child running away crying, but a different

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.110
perspective was brought to light from someone
claiming to be the boy from the story.

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.640
The alternate account says the actor was actually
quite charming, and that they all shared a

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.780
laugh after Guinness suggested the boy abstain
from Star Wars.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:26.880
The author is also adamant that he never cried
either, he just had something in his eye.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.510
Tobey Maguire
Peter Parker is usually a pretty nice guy,

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.160
and Tobey Maguire plays him well.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.670
So it’s only natural to assume that he’d
be nice in real-life too, right?

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:38.010
Well when one fan tried to take a picture
with the actor, it didn’t go as planned.

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.830
In a video that spread across the internet
like wildfire.

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.520
Maguire turns and smacks the camera out of
the fan’s hand.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.530
The actor struts away like it never happened
and disappears into a crowd of security people.

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.220
While everyone’s entitled to some personal
space, the reaction is a little over the top.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.150
And considering how disappointing Spider-Man
3 was, it’s amazing anyone even wanted his

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.290
picture.

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.990
Jared Leto
Being in the business for a long time sometimes

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.240
makes entertainers jaded.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.450
Instead of being grateful for their fans,
they come to resent them.

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.110
And sometimes that comes out in really weird,
really public ways.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.000
Before Jared Leto landed the role as The Joker
in Suicide Squad, he was acting in movies

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.570
like Dallas Buyers Club and Requiem for a
Dream.

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.960
In addition, Leto is also the frontman for
the band 30 Seconds To Mars.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.170
And it was at one of their concerts where
someone took a video of the singer beating

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:24.140
a fan in the head with his microphone.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.980
Shortly after, another video surfaced of him
doing the same thing to someone else at a

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:28.980
different show.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.420
He also recently made headlines for sending
some messed up gifts to his Suicide Squad

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:33.420
cast mates.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:38.860
It seems like no matter where he goes, Jared
Leto is pissing people off.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:39.880
So what do you think of our list?

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.670
Did we miss any other actors who are terrible
to their fans?
