00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:02.635
- [Voiceover] So I have
the function g here.

00:00:02.635 --> 00:00:05.226
It's expressed as a
fourth degree polynomial.

00:00:05.226 --> 00:00:07.957
And I wanna think about the
intervals over which g is

00:00:07.957 --> 00:00:11.098
either concave upwards
or concave downwards.

00:00:11.098 --> 00:00:13.940
Now let's just remind ourselves
what these things look like.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:14.857
So concave,

00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:17.665
concave upwards

00:00:19.703 --> 00:00:21.075
is an interval,

00:00:21.075 --> 00:00:23.011
an interval when you're concave upwards

00:00:23.011 --> 00:00:26.584
is an interval over which
the slope is increasing

00:00:26.584 --> 00:00:29.929
and it tends to look like an
upward opening U like that.

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:34.829
And you can see here that the
slope over here is negative,

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.368
and then as x increases,
it becomes less negative,

00:00:38.368 --> 00:00:40.652
it actually approaches
zero, it becomes zero,

00:00:40.652 --> 00:00:43.334
then it crosses zero and
becomes slightly positive,

00:00:43.334 --> 00:00:45.651
more positive, even more positive.

00:00:45.651 --> 00:00:48.432
So you can see the slope
is constantly increasing.

00:00:48.432 --> 00:00:50.714
And if you think about it
in terms of derivatives,

00:00:50.714 --> 00:00:53.981
it means that you're first
derivative is increasing

00:00:53.981 --> 00:00:55.192
over that interval.

00:00:55.192 --> 00:00:57.218
And in order for your first
derivative to be increasing

00:00:57.218 --> 00:00:59.828
over that interval, your second derivative

00:00:59.828 --> 00:01:02.979
f prime prime of x, actually
let me write it as g,

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:04.693
because we're using g in this example.

00:01:04.693 --> 00:01:08.002
In order for your first
derivative to be increasing,

00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:09.510
your, let me write this.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.343
So g,

00:01:11.578 --> 00:01:13.988
so concave upward means

00:01:13.988 --> 00:01:17.274
that your first derivative increasing,

00:01:17.274 --> 00:01:19.019
increasing,

00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:22.850
which means, which means
that your second derivative

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.409
is greater than zero.

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.325
And concave downward is the opposite.

00:01:28.325 --> 00:01:29.742
Concave downward,

00:01:32.728 --> 00:01:33.921
downward,

00:01:33.921 --> 00:01:36.463
is an interval, or you're
gonna be concave downward

00:01:36.463 --> 00:01:40.380
over an interval when
your slope is decreasing.

00:01:41.428 --> 00:01:44.095
So g prime of x is decreasing

00:01:45.913 --> 00:01:49.251
or we can say that our second derivative,

00:01:49.251 --> 00:01:53.333
our second derivative is less than zero.

00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:55.481
And once again, I can draw it on this.

00:01:55.481 --> 00:01:58.902
So, when x is lower, we have a, look,

00:01:58.902 --> 00:02:00.749
or it looks like we have a positive slope,

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:02.411
then it becomes less positive,

00:02:02.411 --> 00:02:03.549
and then it becomes less positive,

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.020
as it's approaching zero, it becomes zero,

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.723
then it becomes negative,
then even more negative,

00:02:07.723 --> 00:02:09.326
and then even more negative.

00:02:09.326 --> 00:02:11.767
So as you can see, our slope
is constantly decreasing

00:02:11.767 --> 00:02:14.209
as x increases here.

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:15.787
So in order to think about the intervals

00:02:15.787 --> 00:02:20.008
where g is either concave
upward or concave downward,

00:02:20.008 --> 00:02:23.173
what we need to do is let's
find the second derivative of g,

00:02:23.173 --> 00:02:24.232
and then let's think about the points

00:02:24.232 --> 00:02:27.671
at which the second, where
the second derivative can go

00:02:27.671 --> 00:02:31.624
from being positive to negative
or negative to positive

00:02:31.624 --> 00:02:33.995
and those will be places
where it's either undefined

00:02:33.995 --> 00:02:36.313
or where the second
derivative is equal to zero,

00:02:36.313 --> 00:02:38.303
and let's see what's happening
in the interval between.

00:02:38.303 --> 00:02:39.816
And then we'll know over what intervals

00:02:39.816 --> 00:02:42.197
are we concave upward or concave downward.

00:02:42.197 --> 00:02:43.970
So let's do that.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.222
So let's take the first
derivative, g prime of x,

00:02:48.222 --> 00:02:49.951
just gonna apply the power rule a lot.

00:02:49.951 --> 00:02:51.290
Four times negative one

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.948
is negative four x to the
third power plus, okay,

00:02:55.948 --> 00:02:57.480
so you're gonna have two times six

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.083
is plus 12x to the first power,
you can just write it as x.

00:03:02.083 --> 00:03:04.266
And then minus two, I could say

00:03:04.266 --> 00:03:06.235
minus two x to the zeroth power,

00:03:06.235 --> 00:03:07.758
but that's just minus two.

00:03:07.758 --> 00:03:09.655
And then the derivative of
negative three, of a constant

00:03:09.655 --> 00:03:10.963
is just zero.

00:03:10.963 --> 00:03:15.046
And now I can take the second
derivative, g prime prime of x

00:03:15.046 --> 00:03:18.026
is going to be equal to
three times negative four

00:03:18.026 --> 00:03:20.026
is negative 12x squared,

00:03:21.695 --> 00:03:24.278
decrement the exponent plus 12.

00:03:25.583 --> 00:03:28.218
And so let's see, where
could this be undefined?

00:03:28.218 --> 00:03:32.132
Well, the second derivative
is just a quadratic expression

00:03:32.132 --> 00:03:34.177
here which would be defined for any x.

00:03:34.177 --> 00:03:36.104
So it's not going to
be undefined anywhere.

00:03:36.104 --> 00:03:39.234
So, interesting points
where we could transition

00:03:39.234 --> 00:03:42.833
from going from a negative to a positive

00:03:42.833 --> 00:03:45.387
or a positive to a
negative, second derivative

00:03:45.387 --> 00:03:47.579
is where this thing
could be equal to zero.

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:48.621
So let's figure that out.

00:03:48.621 --> 00:03:51.691
So let's figure out where
negative 12x plus 12

00:03:51.691 --> 00:03:53.400
could be equal to zero.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.084
See, we could subtract 12 from both sides

00:03:56.084 --> 00:04:00.622
and we get negative 12x squared
is equal to negative 12.

00:04:00.622 --> 00:04:02.434
Divide both sides by negative 12,

00:04:02.434 --> 00:04:04.631
you get x squared is equal to one

00:04:04.631 --> 00:04:08.532
or x could be equal to the plus or minus,

00:04:08.532 --> 00:04:10.891
or x could be equal to the plus
or minus square root of one,

00:04:10.891 --> 00:04:12.710
which is, of course, just one.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.183
So, at the second derivative
at plus or minus one

00:04:16.183 --> 00:04:19.977
is equal to zero, so either
between plus or minus one

00:04:19.977 --> 00:04:22.414
or on either side of
them, we are going to be,

00:04:22.414 --> 00:04:25.463
we could be concave upward
or concave downward.

00:04:25.463 --> 00:04:27.488
So let's think about this.

00:04:27.488 --> 00:04:30.244
And to think about this, I'm
gonna make a number line.

00:04:30.244 --> 00:04:33.761
Let me find a nice, soothing color here.

00:04:33.761 --> 00:04:36.721
All right, that's a nice, soothing color.

00:04:36.721 --> 00:04:39.251
And, let's say, we should
make the number line

00:04:39.251 --> 00:04:40.914
a little bit bigger.

00:04:40.914 --> 00:04:44.914
So, there we go, let's
utilize the screen space.

00:04:45.921 --> 00:04:50.004
And so, if this is zero
and this is negative one,

00:04:50.982 --> 00:04:55.145
this is negative two,
this is positive one,

00:04:55.145 --> 00:04:56.777
this is positive two.

00:04:56.777 --> 00:05:00.782
We know that at x equals negative one

00:05:00.782 --> 00:05:04.553
and x equals one, our second
derivative is equal to zero.

00:05:04.553 --> 00:05:05.862
So let's think about what's happening

00:05:05.862 --> 00:05:08.975
in between those places to
see if our second derivative

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:11.616
is positive or negative, and
from that we'll be able to say

00:05:11.616 --> 00:05:14.902
where it's concave upward
or concave downward.

00:05:14.902 --> 00:05:19.145
So, on this first
interval right over here,

00:05:19.145 --> 00:05:21.520
so this is the interval from,

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.333
this is the interval where we're going

00:05:24.333 --> 00:05:28.125
from negative infinity to negative one.

00:05:28.125 --> 00:05:30.564
Well, let's just try a
value in that interval

00:05:30.564 --> 00:05:31.825
to see what whether our second derivative

00:05:31.825 --> 00:05:33.191
is positive or negative.

00:05:33.191 --> 00:05:35.727
And let's see, an easy value
there could be negative two,

00:05:35.727 --> 00:05:36.613
it's in that interval,

00:05:36.613 --> 00:05:40.021
so let's take g prime
prime of negative two,

00:05:40.021 --> 00:05:43.967
which is equal to negative 12 times four,

00:05:43.967 --> 00:05:46.049
because negative two
squared is positive four.

00:05:46.049 --> 00:05:48.382
So it's negative 48 plus 12,

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.901
so it's equal to negative 36.

00:05:52.901 --> 00:05:54.751
The important thing to realize, then,

00:05:54.751 --> 00:05:55.988
is well, if over here it's negative,

00:05:55.988 --> 00:05:57.121
then over this whole interval,

00:05:57.121 --> 00:05:59.135
because it's not crossing through zero,

00:05:59.135 --> 00:06:01.262
or it's not discontinuous
at any of these points,

00:06:01.262 --> 00:06:03.000
that's why we picked this interval.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.204
That over this whole interval,

00:06:04.204 --> 00:06:07.537
g prime prime of x is less than zero,

00:06:08.518 --> 00:06:10.117
which means that over this interval

00:06:10.117 --> 00:06:12.384
we are concave downwards.

00:06:12.384 --> 00:06:14.801
So concave, concave downward,

00:06:17.228 --> 00:06:18.941
concave downward.

00:06:18.941 --> 00:06:23.108
Now let's go to the interval
between negative one and one.

00:06:25.263 --> 00:06:28.981
So this is the open interval
between negative one and one.

00:06:28.981 --> 00:06:30.575
And let's try a value there.

00:06:30.575 --> 00:06:33.089
Let's just try zero
will be easy to compute,

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:36.517
g prime prime of zero, well,
when x is zero, this is zero,

00:06:36.517 --> 00:06:38.431
so it's just gonna be equal to 12.

00:06:38.431 --> 00:06:41.336
The important thing to realize
is our second derivative here

00:06:41.336 --> 00:06:45.253
is greater than zero, so
we are concave upward,

00:06:46.658 --> 00:06:49.241
concave upward on this interval

00:06:50.327 --> 00:06:51.850
between negative one and one.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:55.733
And then finally, let's
look at, let's look at

00:06:55.733 --> 00:06:59.953
the interval where x is greater than one.

00:06:59.953 --> 00:07:03.370
So this is the interval
from one to infinity,

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:04.723
if we want to do it that way.

00:07:04.723 --> 00:07:06.040
And let's just try a value.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.164
Let's try g prime prime of two,

00:07:09.164 --> 00:07:10.457
'cause that's in the interval.

00:07:10.457 --> 00:07:12.386
And g prime prime of two
is gonna be the same thing

00:07:12.386 --> 00:07:13.887
as g prime prime of negative two,

00:07:13.887 --> 00:07:15.797
'cause whether you have a
negative two or a positive two,

00:07:15.797 --> 00:07:17.561
you square it becomes four.

00:07:17.561 --> 00:07:19.474
So you're gonna have
four times negative 12,

00:07:19.474 --> 00:07:22.655
which is negative 48 plus
12, which is negative 36.

00:07:22.655 --> 00:07:26.098
So this is negative 36, and
so, once again on this interval

00:07:26.098 --> 00:07:28.931
you are concave, concave downward.

00:07:31.358 --> 00:07:33.479
Now let's, I graphed this ahead of time,

00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:36.817
let's see if what we just
established is actually consistent

00:07:36.817 --> 00:07:40.020
with what the graph actually looks like.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.123
We were able to come up
with these, these insights

00:07:42.123 --> 00:07:44.718
about the concavity without graphing it.

00:07:44.718 --> 00:07:48.824
But now, it's kind of satisfying
to take a look at a graph

00:07:48.824 --> 00:07:51.184
and actually let me see if I
can match up the intervals.

00:07:51.184 --> 00:07:53.495
Actually this is pretty closely matched,

00:07:53.495 --> 00:07:55.601
all right over here.

00:07:55.601 --> 00:07:56.934
And so, this is,

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:01.691
actually we can make it a
little bit smaller, all right.

00:08:01.691 --> 00:08:05.345
And so, let me move my boundy box.

00:08:05.345 --> 00:08:08.642
So, I'm saying that I'm concave downward

00:08:08.642 --> 00:08:12.309
between negative infinity,
negative infinity

00:08:14.746 --> 00:08:18.589
all the way until, all the
way until negative one,

00:08:18.589 --> 00:08:21.571
all the way until this
point right over here.

00:08:21.571 --> 00:08:23.027
So, all the way until that point.

00:08:23.027 --> 00:08:24.475
And that looks right.

00:08:24.475 --> 00:08:26.856
It looks like the slope
is constantly decreasing

00:08:26.856 --> 00:08:29.995
all the way until we get
to x equals negative one,

00:08:29.995 --> 00:08:32.507
and then the slope starts increasing.

00:08:32.507 --> 00:08:35.637
The slope starts increasing from there,

00:08:35.637 --> 00:08:37.642
from there all the way,

00:08:37.642 --> 00:08:39.569
and right at x we're transitioning,

00:08:39.569 --> 00:08:42.506
so I'm gonna leave a little,
I won't color in that.

00:08:42.506 --> 00:08:45.401
And so here our slope is increasing,

00:08:45.401 --> 00:08:46.930
let me do that same color.

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:50.367
Our slope is increasing,
increasing, increasing,

00:08:50.367 --> 00:08:52.527
increasing, increasing all the way

00:08:52.527 --> 00:08:54.132
until we get to x equals one.

00:08:54.132 --> 00:08:56.306
And then our slope
starts decreasing again.

00:08:56.306 --> 00:08:59.200
And we get back into concave downwards.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.736
Oops, I wanna do that
in that orange color.

00:09:02.736 --> 00:09:05.653
We get back into concave downwards.

00:09:07.178 --> 00:09:08.237
So what we're able to figure out

00:09:08.237 --> 00:09:10.517
by just taking the derivatives
and doing a little algebra,

00:09:10.517 --> 00:09:14.350
we can see quite clearly
looking at the graph.
