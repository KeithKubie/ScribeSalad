00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.310
Here's a very simple threaded program that uses POSIX threads,

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.650
or p-threads as the library is also known. We'll discuss POSIX

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.560
threads for the remainder of the lesson, but most of

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.860
the concepts will apply to all thread libraries. The entry point

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.440
for our process is main, as always. And main will

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.940
spawn two new threads, t1 and t2 which will enter at

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.960
the procedures f1 and f2 respectively. That's why we passed the

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.440
function pointer as we create these threads. These functions become like

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.420
the main of our other threads. And as we see,

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.890
these threads are going to print out a message over and

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.160
over that says that they are the better thread. Notice that

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.740
main we have this join method. We'll discuss this a little

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.010
more later, but basically this mean that the thread is

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.500
going to wait for thread one to finish before it goes

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.200
any further. And then join with thread two means that it

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.160
will wait for thread two to finish before going any further.
