Why Do Vitamins Make Urine Bright Yellow

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.960
If you’ve ever taken a daily multivitamin
you too might have noticed your urine turning

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.189
a bright yellow-ish color.

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.140
Take your vitamins and eat some asparagus
and you might just think you’re dying the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.570
next time you pee!

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.520
What’s happening is that urine will turn
a bright, sometimes neon, yellow in response

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.360
to excess riboflavin.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:47.120
Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, is a
common ingredient in almost all multi-vitamins.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.040
It was first discovered in 1872, when chemist
Alexander Wynter Blyth noticed a pigment in

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.170
milk that was yellow-green.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.700
In 1879, it was reported as lactochrome and
lactoflavin.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.829
It wasn’t until the 1930s that the substance
giving off a yellow pigment was characterized

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:05.829
as riboflavin.

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:10.710
(The “flavin” portion coming from the
Latin word “flavus”, meaning “yellow”

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.710
or “blonde”.)

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.270
So why does riboflavin give off a yellowish
color?

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.119
Like almost anything that has color, it all
comes down to light absorption.

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.280
Light, in general, is merely electromagnetic
radiation.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.030
This radiation comes to us in a waveform and
is classified by its wavelength.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.900
Shorter wavelengths come to us in the form
of x-rays and ultraviolet light.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.640
Longer wavelengths come to us in the form
of things like microwaves and radio waves.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.290
The light we can see is actually only a very
narrow band of wavelength between 400-700

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.079
nanometers in length.

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:46.600
The color is classified by the length.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.960
For example, 400-500nm will appear blue, and
600-700nm will appear red.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.730
The colors we see are a result of the wavelengths
not absorbed by the material.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:04.570
So if a material absorbs light in the 400-500nm
range (blue) then the color we will perceive

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.079
is in the 500-700nm range (greens, yellows
and reds).

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:16.489
Riboflavin, specifically, absorbs light strongly
in the 260-370nm range.

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.269
While this falls outside of the light we can
see with our eyes, it’s also Riboflavin’s

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:27.819
ability to absorb light at 450nm (the blues)
that give it its distinctive yellowish color.

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.799
So why does it turn pee yellow?

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.669
The answer is simply how the body gets rid
of excess.

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:38.980
Several studies have shown that approximately
50% of all excess riboflavin gets excreted

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.090
in the urine.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.730
Those same studies show that the maximum amount
that can be absorbed in a single dose was

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.370
about 27mg, with half of that being absorbed
in the first 1.1 hours.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:57.120
Given that the recommended adult daily intake
of riboflavin is between 1-1.6mg per day and

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.200
some common doses of riboflavin in multivitamins
(that I could find) are 25, 50, and 100 mg,

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.239
it’s easy to see that excess amounts can
be easily attained.

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.110
The result is a nice color to your urine that,
if you’re a hypochondriac, may make you

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.110
think you’re dying.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.389
As a doctor friend of mine remarked when I
was discussing this with him and excessive

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:19.359
amounts of unneeded vitamins Americans buy
every year, “Americans have the most expensive

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:20.579
urine in the world.

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.549
It’s like flushing money down the drain.”
