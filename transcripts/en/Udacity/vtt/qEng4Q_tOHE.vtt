Hey kids, this is Matt, and in this lesson I'm

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.200
going to show you how to extract and see DNA with

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.720
the naked eye using common household ingredients and tools. Now

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.080
this is something you should be able to do in

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.890
your own kitchen, but you're going to need a couple things

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.040
from your cubbourd. Before we begin, I want you to

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.610
try to tell me. Which do you think, of these

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.380
samples, would be best to try to extract DNA from?

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.640
A tasty candy, like jellybeans? A raw fruit,

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.840
like strawberries? Or, a cooked meat, like ground turkey?
