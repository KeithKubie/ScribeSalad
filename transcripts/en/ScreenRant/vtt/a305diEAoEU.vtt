00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.090
Even when a film is deserving of a perfect
5-star rating, it doesn’t mean they’re

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:12.090
flawless.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.290
Directors spend so much time making sure the
larger picture of their movie is cohesive,

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.410
that sometimes little things fall through
the cracks.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.240
These may be highly-paid professionals, but
they are human and can let an error or two

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.369
slip by into the final cut.

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.270
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Biggest Movie
Mistakes Hidden in Popular Films.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.270
Ant-Man

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.160
In the opening scene, Dr. Pym punches Mitchell
Carson in the face and blood can be seen pouring

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.160
out of his nose.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.570
As the scene progresses, we notice that the
blood slowly disappears.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.520
It seems Mitchell was slowly cleaning but
the real mistake can occurs when his close-up

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.770
reveals a very clean and white handkerchief!

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:43.770
Jurassic World

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.890
Chris Pratt is America’s new favorite leading
man, and his magic even impacts the props

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:48.890
he touches.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.870
When Claire and Owen are hiding from the Indominus
Rex in Jurassic World, Owen rests his rifle

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.390
against the driver’s door of an old Jeep.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.000
As the dinosaur searches for its prey, it
places its head on that side of the vehicle

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.829
and shakes it around a couple of times.

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.690
When Owen looks back around to see if the
coast is clear, the rifle is in the same exact

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.690
spot, unmoved.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.250
This is one instance where practical and digital
effects didn’t mesh well to create a seamless

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.390
shot.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.390
Mad Max: Fury Road

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.420
Yes, even Best Picture candidates have imperfections.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.320
Upon doing an ammunition inventory count,
Toast says that the group has four rounds

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.909
left for the SKS rifle, which she calls Big
Boy.

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:28.630
A few moments later, Max fires a single shot
from that same gun, and Toast informs Max

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.560
he only has two shots left.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.789
If Toast’s initial count was correct, Max
should have three remaining.

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:38.950
It’s a glaring oversight that creates an
unnecessary inconsistency between two scenes

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.799
close together and it could have easily been
avoided with a quick double check.

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.340
But nobody said the script was awards worthy,
right?

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.990
The Martian

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.200
When astronaut Mark Watney is presumed dead
by his crew, they have no choice but to leave

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.950
him on Mars so they can escape in time.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.020
But as it turns out, Mark wasn’t alone.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.920
In the shot where the character regains consciousness
after being knocked out, the cameraman is

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.229
visible in the reflection of Watney’s space
helmet.

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.630
With all the video recordings Watney does
in the film, this guy was probably the unsung

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.319
hero of the story, yet didn’t get any recognition.

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:10.760
Either that, or filming reflective surfaces
is a little harder than it looks, even when

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.760
Ridley Scott is involved.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.750
There is even a shot a little later that seems
to show the whole crew reflected in his helmet

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.900
since there are not other structures or anything
around him, but we’ll let you decide!

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.290
Avengers: Age of Ultron

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.129
One of the more entertaining sequences in
this superhero sequel is when Earth’s Mightiest

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.000
all try to lift Thor’s hammer at a party.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.140
But the God of Thunder’s weapon isn’t
the only magical item in the scene.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.270
After all his friends fail at the game, Thor
picks the hammer up with a drink in his hand.

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.130
However, in the very next shot, that same
drink is on the table, even though Thor never

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.200
stopped to put it down.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.370
Joss Whedon had a lot to sort through with
this film, but he should have been able to

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.370
see this.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.260
Chalk it up to the dangers of splicing takes.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.260
Inside Out

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.270
This modern classic was hailed as Pixar’s
glorious return to form, but things got off

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.810
to a shaky start – in the very first scenes.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.260
At the beginning of the movie when baby Riley
appears, her mother appears to be wearing

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.260
glasses.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.220
However, when the perspective changes to have
Mom visible from Riley’s point of view,

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.450
she’s not wearing the glasses.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.900
It’s always possible she took them off in
between shots, but when you’re looking at

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.940
your baby daughter for the first time, you’d
want the clearest view you could get.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.390
Something doesn’t add up here.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.390
Furious 7

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.750
Fans were disappointed when the character
Hobbs was left out of commission for a majority

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.720
of the film’s running time, but there was
good reason.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.030
He was recovering from a variety of injuries.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.829
Elena tells Dom early on that one of those
was a leg broken in two places.

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:32.450
A shot of Hobbs in the hospital bed confirms
this, as he sports a cast on his leg.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.420
But as the film approaches its finale and
Hobbs decides he has to jump into the action,

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.069
there’s no cast on his leg and he walks
without a limp.

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.620
We think we may have found who can play Wolverine
after Hugh Jackman.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.019
Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.810
During one of this movie’s many thrilling
action bits, Ethan and Benji are involved

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.109
in a chase while driving a car.

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:54.499
The filmmakers use this as an opportunity
for a playful gag, when Ethan asks Benji if

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:59.659
he’s wearing his seatbelt before attempting
an insane stunt.

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:03.290
But it probably would have been funnier if
there was some consistency regarding the seatbelt.

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.189
Throughout the sequence, Benji’s seatbelt
alternates between on and off, making things

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:08.370
very confusing for the joke.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.500
Perhaps this is why Ethan asked him about
it?

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.560
Either way, Benji doesn’t seem to care about
his wellbeing even when his life is in danger.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.049
Star Wars: The Force Awakens

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.389
The First Order one-ups the old Galactic Empire
with their Starkiller base, a weapon that

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.600
can blow up entire star systems instead of
a single planet.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.480
The film reveals that it gets its power from
the planet’s sun, draining all of its energy.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.560
When that happens, everything should go pitch
black, but at the end of the movie, Kylo Ren,

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.220
Rey and Finn are all visible in the forest
during their lightsaber duel.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.730
In reality, only man-made light would allow
them to see each other, but that wouldn’t

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.090
make for a very cinematic finale.

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.800
Sometimes, you have to bend the rules.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.700
Kingsman: The Secret Service

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.370
Typos happen even to the best of us, but during
a film production that takes months, there’s

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.440
no excuse for things to be spelled incorrectly.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.210
However, Kingsman never got a proofreader
to look over some graphics.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.290
During the news broadcast covering the release
of the free Valentine SIM cards, the headline

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:01.790
spells “worldwide” wrong.

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.440
It says that the product will be distributed
“wordlwide” in big letters for all to

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.440
see.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.860
Modern media is a mad dash to be the first
to report a story, but it doesn’t help credibility

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.910
if there are glaring errors like this.

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.290
Those are our picks for mistakes hidden in
popular films.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.400
