00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
All right. So a good first step for solving this problem is to focus on trying to solve

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
for the time Δt that the electron spends in this electric field here.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I'm going to use this kinematics equation here.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And you notice that I've just applied it to x and not to y. We'll do the y equation in a second.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And the direction I'm calling x is this direction here. I'm going to call this direction y.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The field is only acting in the y direction

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
so I know there's not going to be any x acceleration so this term drops out.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And this gives us that the time the electron spends in the field

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
is equal to the length of the field divided by the speed the electron enters the field with.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
All right. So now I'm going to use this kinematics equation to work in the y direction.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And we know that initially the electron enters with only the velocity in the x direction.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
This term goes to 0.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
We know from our earlier parallel plate problems that the acceleration

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
along the direction of the field is going to be equal to the strength of the field E

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
times the charge on the electron divided by the electron's mass.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And this gives us a nice equation for our displacement in the y direction.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Now we can substitute in our value of Δt into this equation,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
which gives us this equation here.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And doing some algebra, I can solve for the electric field strength E

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
in terms of the all these other variables.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Now this looks quite messy but I actually know all these values.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I know the mass of the electron. I know its charge.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And I know the x and y distances and our initial speed.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And plugging in all those values, I get that the electric field strength should be 455 N/C.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
That means that if the electric field here is 455 N/C,

00:01:26.000 --> 09:59:59.000
we should get this kind of bending and hit this part of the screen.
