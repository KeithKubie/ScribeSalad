00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:02.100
[electronica music]

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.633
MOREHSHIN ALLAHYARI: I think
genius is a word that gets used

00:00:03.633 --> 00:00:05.834
so much more for men,
and I've always found

00:00:05.834 --> 00:00:07.567
that were very problematic.

00:00:07.567 --> 00:00:09.166
I'm here to change
that, I guess.

00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:10.200
Here we are.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.100
I was doing a lot of 3D
animation and 3D modeling.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.633
But just like seeing something
that you modeled in a virtual

00:00:19.633 --> 00:00:23.100
space coming to life from this
digital space to a physical

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.500
space layer by layer, I just
thought that's-- that's crazy

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.533
that you can just do that.

00:00:31.367 --> 00:00:33.900
I was doing a lot of
research around how

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.734
oil relates to both jihad,
but also, like, capitalism.

00:00:37.734 --> 00:00:40.967
And then the video of ISIS
destroying the artifacts

00:00:40.967 --> 00:00:42.734
at Mosul Museum came out.

00:00:42.734 --> 00:00:45.600
I was like, OK, how-- how
can I, like, relate this?

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.600
Because everything that
I'm reading right now,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.200
everything that
I'm working on is--

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.333
is about this, like,
destruction and how the 3D

00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:55.000
printer then become
this-- this machine

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.367
that rebirthed these things.

00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.800
We were recreating
them based on images.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.867
And once I started to do
research on these artifacts

00:01:04.867 --> 00:01:08.000
that were destroyed, I realized
that there was such a lack

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.633
of information about them.

00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:13.100
I contacted so many historians
and scholars that specifically

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.467
work on Hatral or Mosul.

00:01:15.467 --> 00:01:18.734
I wanted to find a way that I
would share that, give access

00:01:18.734 --> 00:01:22.166
both to kind of the sculptures,
but also this information

00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:23.500
that I gathered.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.834
So inside each artifact,
there is a memory card

00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:29.734
and a flash drive that
is embedded that contains

00:01:29.734 --> 00:01:31.333
all the information--

00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:36.100
PDF files, images, videos,
even my email correspondence

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.734
with different scholars.

00:01:37.734 --> 00:01:39.800
The more people read
about it, the more people

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.300
printed those pieces, the
more people have saved it

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.967
on their computers,
the more these things

00:01:44.967 --> 00:01:48.333
will get saved and remembered.

00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:50.700
I was really interested
in figuring out,

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.667
what are the material that I
can use I would be the closest

00:01:53.667 --> 00:01:55.433
to the original
material, which was,

00:01:55.433 --> 00:01:59.567
like, actually like a stone
more like dense material, right?

00:01:59.567 --> 00:02:01.767
I just thought, resin would
be cool, because, like,

00:02:01.767 --> 00:02:05.633
it almost looks like a
ghost of these objects.

00:02:05.633 --> 00:02:09.667
I only had seen at that point
the object in a digital space,

00:02:09.667 --> 00:02:10.700
in a virtual space.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.967
And then seeing it
in a physical space

00:02:12.967 --> 00:02:14.800
is a very different experience.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.767
So I just remember opening
the door of the 3D printer

00:02:17.767 --> 00:02:21.567
and having this thing printed,
but it would be so much,

00:02:21.567 --> 00:02:23.300
like, support
material around it,

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.200
so it almost felt like
dug in the ground.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.567
It was very, like,
archaeological in some ways.

00:02:29.567 --> 00:02:32.000
There's really no way
to replace these objects

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.467
that were destroyed.

00:02:33.467 --> 00:02:35.433
To me, that's where, like,
the beauty of that project

00:02:35.433 --> 00:02:37.667
was, when I could just
use the technology

00:02:37.667 --> 00:02:42.433
to archive something that was
meant to be lost or destroyed.

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:50.533
All the stories of
superheroes are 99% about men.

00:02:50.533 --> 00:02:52.300
We have, like, very
little figures that

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.900
are superheroes that are women.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.266
And I was looking to find these
female dark goddess figures

00:02:58.266 --> 00:03:00.633
from different
mythical narratives

00:03:00.633 --> 00:03:02.633
based in the Middle
East, bringing them back.

00:03:02.633 --> 00:03:06.400
Not just reappropriating
their form and sculpture,

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.767
but also refiguring
their stories.

00:03:08.767 --> 00:03:11.633
If you want to, like, imagine
other kind of futures,

00:03:11.633 --> 00:03:15.467
I think you need new figures,
new stories, new histories

00:03:15.467 --> 00:03:18.200
to use as a point of departure.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.367
I obviously, like,
use technologies.

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:23.633
I have a lot of hope around that
and what's possible with it.

00:03:23.633 --> 00:03:26.734
But I also think there's like
a very dark side of it, which

00:03:26.734 --> 00:03:30.100
is that who gets to have
access to what technology

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.100
and use it in what way?

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.700
But also, you can
make small changes.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.800
I-- I really, really do believe
in the power of micro changes

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.700
for macro influences.
