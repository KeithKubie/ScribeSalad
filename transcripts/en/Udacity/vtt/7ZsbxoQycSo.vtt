One of the most amazing things about the mobile

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.750
platform is the incredible array of sensors these devices typically

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.670
have. This phone has a camera that can take

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.960
stills and video, has audio input and output, it has

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.540
a GPS, a compass, a tilt sensing accelerometer. Far

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.950
more sensors than a desktop or laptop typically has. And

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.240
all this, in a device that I'm typically holding

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.120
in the palm of my hand. This enables the mobile

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.270
platform to play host to incredibly engaging and interactive user experiences.
