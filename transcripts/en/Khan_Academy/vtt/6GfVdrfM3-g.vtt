00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.920
- [Instructor] Here's a graph
showing the population growth

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.160
in four US cities from 1860 to 1900.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.530
In 1860, before the Civil War,

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.840
New York City was the biggest
city in the United States,

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.610
but even it didn't have
more than a million people.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.530
There wasn't a single city
of more than a million

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.450
in the whole country at that point.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.325
Compare that to just 40
years later when not one,

00:00:22.325 --> 00:00:25.840
but three cities had
passed the million mark,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.580
and New York had nearly
3.5 million residents.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.020
Proportionally, Chicago's
population growth

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.283
was even more drastic,

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:37.270
from only about 100,000 residents in 1860,

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.080
it got 17 times bigger by 1900,

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.710
with about 1.7 million residents.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:43.680
Traditionally,

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.500
Americans had been a pretty
rural farming people,

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.380
but starting in the late 19th century,

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.290
there was a rapid shift
towards urbanization.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.790
By 1920, urban residents would
outnumber country dwellers

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.790
in the United States for the first time.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.700
And today, more than 80% of
Americans live in cities.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.900
So what led to this explosion
in the population of cities

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.950
in the decades after the Civil War?

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.935
The major factors behind this shift

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:13.935
were industrialization,
immigration, and migration.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.130
Now we've been talking
about those three things

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.108
in various forms in American
history up until this point,

00:01:19.108 --> 00:01:22.029
from the cool inventions of
the first industrial revolution

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:26.533
to the influx of Irish and
German immigrants in the 1840s

00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:29.610
to the movement of
Americans ever westward.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.355
So industrialization,
immigration, and migration

00:01:32.355 --> 00:01:35.692
weren't new forces in American society,

00:01:35.692 --> 00:01:38.860
but there were unique aspects of all three

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.943
of these processes during the Gilded Age

00:01:40.943 --> 00:01:44.630
that contributed to the
development of cities in this era.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.810
One thing that changed was the nature

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.460
of work that people did.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.370
During the Gilded Age,

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.810
there was a tipping point in
the American labor market.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.600
In 1880, for the first time ever,

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.950
the number of people who worked
for someone else for wages,

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.730
people who had a boss and needed

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.830
to do what they said to get paid,

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.160
outnumbered Americans who
worked for themselves,

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.632
like farmers who could
decide for themselves

00:02:09.632 --> 00:02:12.530
when to sow or harvest their crops.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.825
The second industrial revolution,

00:02:13.825 --> 00:02:15.528
which began after the Civil War,

00:02:15.528 --> 00:02:20.180
was a booming era of expansion
and industrial production.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.960
So there were a lot of
factory jobs available,

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.053
and most of those jobs were
for unskilled laborers,

00:02:27.053 --> 00:02:29.440
that is workers who don't require any kind

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.930
of special training
before they start a job.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.151
So there was an overall
transition from farm work that

00:02:35.151 --> 00:02:40.151
was self-directed to unskilled
factory work done for a boss.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.082
Another change during the Gilded Age

00:02:44.082 --> 00:02:48.490
was in who was doing the
immigrating and migrating.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:49.398
Until the 1840s,

00:02:49.398 --> 00:02:51.324
most immigrants to the United States

00:02:51.324 --> 00:02:53.596
had been Protestant Christians

00:02:53.596 --> 00:02:56.325
from northern and western Europe,

00:02:56.325 --> 00:03:00.100
and they were relatively
well off financially.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.657
After the Civil War, a
variety of factors abroad,

00:03:03.657 --> 00:03:06.200
combined with the wide availability

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.742
of jobs in the United States,

00:03:07.742 --> 00:03:11.450
brought different types of
immigrants to American cities.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.849
These new immigrants, as they were called,

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.805
tended to be from southern
and eastern Europe,

00:03:16.805 --> 00:03:19.180
Mexico, and Asia,

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.331
and they differed from old
immigrants in that they tended

00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:25.407
to be poorer, have darker complexions,

00:03:25.407 --> 00:03:28.850
and practiced Catholicism or Judaism

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.400
instead of Protestantism.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.940
In addition in this era,

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.990
African Americans from the south began

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.290
to migrate to northern
and mid-western cities.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.430
All of these immigrants and migrants

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.794
created a large industrial workforce.

00:03:42.794 --> 00:03:45.410
But why did they all move to the city?

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.928
Let's take a look at some
of the push and pull factors

00:03:48.928 --> 00:03:51.452
that prompted people to uproot themselves

00:03:51.452 --> 00:03:55.080
and head to American cities
during the Gilded Age.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.410
First, there were push
factors, or things that were

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.160
pushing people out of their
previous living situations.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.561
A big one was poverty and just a lack

00:04:04.561 --> 00:04:07.730
of financial mobility at home.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.414
Farmers in many countries were
hit hard by the mechanization

00:04:10.414 --> 00:04:13.300
of agriculture, which
happened in this time period.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.746
About a third of the people
moving to cities were Americans

00:04:16.746 --> 00:04:20.930
leaving farms and heading to
the city for industrial jobs.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.410
Another push factor was persecution

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.100
and discrimination at home.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.300
The Russian government

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.870
took an increasingly intolerant
position towards Jews

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:30.880
in this time period,

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.810
who were subject to mob violence

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.490
and campaigns of ethnic
cleansing in Europe.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.020
In the American south, the
emergence of Jim Crow laws

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.120
and an increase in lynchings
were among the reasons

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.530
that African Americans elected
to leave after the Civil War.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.380
But what were the pull factors
that landed them in cities?

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.370
For one thing, many struggling
immigrants from abroad

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.480
didn't have the money to go anywhere else.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.040
So after they arrived,
they just stayed put.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.180
But the main reason that
people moved to cities

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.050
is because that's where the jobs were.

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.010
With the development of steam
power and electrification,

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.430
factories no longer had to
be located next to waterways.

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.220
So cities developed as industrial hubs.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.910
Often cities would develop as the center

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.250
for one specific industry,
like steel in Pittsburgh,

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.840
meat packaging in Chicago,
or clothing in New York.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.520
People also found communities
of support in cities.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.710
Earlier immigrants might
send money and information

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.610
to their families and friends back home,

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.520
helping them to move and get established.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.770
This facilitated the development
of urban neighborhoods,

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.459
where people from similar backgrounds

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:40.166
spoke the same language,
ate the same food,

00:05:40.166 --> 00:05:42.570
and provided each other with assistance.

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:43.702
In these ethnic enclaves,

00:05:43.702 --> 00:05:46.440
people could get newspapers and even go

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.027
to see theater performances
in their native languages.

00:05:49.027 --> 00:05:51.540
So let's finish by taking a look

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.821
at two narratives of immigrants

00:05:53.821 --> 00:05:57.030
arriving in American
cities in this time period.

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.230
The first one is from
Lee Chew, who immigrated

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:05.230
to San Francisco from China
at age 16 in the year 1880.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.153
He wrote,

00:06:06.153 --> 00:06:07.577
"When I got to San Francisco,

00:06:07.577 --> 00:06:10.042
"which was before the
passage of the Exclusion Act,

00:06:10.042 --> 00:06:12.327
"I was half starved, because I was afraid

00:06:12.327 --> 00:06:14.049
"to eat the provisions of the barbarians.

00:06:14.049 --> 00:06:16.537
"But a few days living
in the Chinese quarter

00:06:16.537 --> 00:06:17.747
"made me happy again.

00:06:17.747 --> 00:06:19.897
"A man got me work as a house servant

00:06:19.897 --> 00:06:21.317
"in an American family.

00:06:21.317 --> 00:06:23.077
"When I went to work for
that American family,

00:06:23.077 --> 00:06:24.927
"I could not speak a word of English,

00:06:24.927 --> 00:06:26.355
"and I didn't know
anything about housework.

00:06:26.355 --> 00:06:28.747
"I did not understand
what the lady said to me,

00:06:28.747 --> 00:06:32.427
"but she showed me how to
cook, wash, iron, sweep, dust,

00:06:32.427 --> 00:06:35.877
"make beds, wash dishes, clean
windows, paint and brass,

00:06:35.877 --> 00:06:38.127
"polish the knives and forks, et cetera.

00:06:38.127 --> 00:06:38.960
"In six months,

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.097
"I had learned how to do the
work of our house quite well,

00:06:41.097 --> 00:06:43.337
"and I was getting $5 a week and board

00:06:43.337 --> 00:06:45.587
"and putting away about $4.25 a week.

00:06:45.587 --> 00:06:47.157
"I had also learned some English.

00:06:47.157 --> 00:06:49.457
"I sent money home to comfort my parents.

00:06:49.457 --> 00:06:52.307
"But though I dressed well and
lived well and had pleasure,

00:06:52.307 --> 00:06:53.968
"going quite often to the Chinese theater

00:06:53.968 --> 00:06:56.047
"and to dinner parties in Chinatown,

00:06:56.047 --> 00:06:59.120
"I saved $50 in the first six months."

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.163
The second one is from Mary Antin,

00:07:01.163 --> 00:07:04.482
who immigrated to Boston
from what is now Belarus

00:07:04.482 --> 00:07:08.650
at the age of 13 in the year 1894.

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:09.483
She wrote,

00:07:09.483 --> 00:07:13.087
"The first meal was an object
lesson of much variety.

00:07:13.087 --> 00:07:16.127
"My father produced several
kinds of food ready to eat,

00:07:16.127 --> 00:07:18.527
"without any cooking, from little tin cans

00:07:18.527 --> 00:07:20.177
"that had printing all over them.

00:07:20.177 --> 00:07:22.507
"He attempted to introduce us to a queer,

00:07:22.507 --> 00:07:25.347
"slippery kind of fruit,
which he called banana,

00:07:25.347 --> 00:07:27.367
"but had to give it up for the time being.

00:07:27.367 --> 00:07:30.037
"On our second day, a little
girl from across the alley

00:07:30.037 --> 00:07:32.327
"came and offered to conduct us to school.

00:07:32.327 --> 00:07:34.827
"My father was out, but we five between us

00:07:34.827 --> 00:07:36.987
"had a few words of English by this time.

00:07:36.987 --> 00:07:38.177
"We knew the word school.

00:07:38.177 --> 00:07:39.087
"We understood.

00:07:39.087 --> 00:07:41.647
"This child who had never
seen us 'til yesterday,

00:07:41.647 --> 00:07:43.337
"who could not pronounce our names,

00:07:43.337 --> 00:07:45.287
"who was not much better dressed than we,

00:07:45.287 --> 00:07:47.646
"was able to offer us the
freedom of the schools of Boston.

00:07:47.646 --> 00:07:50.697
"We had to visit the stores and be dressed

00:07:50.697 --> 00:07:53.517
"from head to foot in American clothing.

00:07:53.517 --> 00:07:56.047
"We had to learn the
mysteries of the iron stove,

00:07:56.047 --> 00:07:58.127
"the washboard, and the speaking tube,

00:07:58.127 --> 00:08:00.207
"and above all, we had to learn English.

00:08:00.207 --> 00:08:02.487
"With our despised immigrant clothing,

00:08:02.487 --> 00:08:05.957
"we shed also our impossible Hebrew names.

00:08:05.957 --> 00:08:07.107
"A committee of our friends,

00:08:07.107 --> 00:08:09.607
"several years ahead of
us in American experience,

00:08:09.607 --> 00:08:10.587
"put their heads together

00:08:10.587 --> 00:08:13.280
"and concocted American names for us all."

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.380
So what similarities and
differences do you see

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:20.110
between the experiences of
Lee Chew and Mary Antin?

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:22.950
Why do you think they
immigrated to American cities,

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:25.448
and what do you think
their lives would be like

00:08:25.448 --> 00:08:27.753
going forward in the Gilded Age?
