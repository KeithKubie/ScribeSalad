00:00:00.048 --> 00:00:00.955
- [Instructor] So we're told

00:00:00.955 --> 00:00:04.609
that Amanda Young wants
to win some prizes.

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:07.465
A cereal company is giving away a prize

00:00:07.465 --> 00:00:11.238
in each box of cereal, and they advertise,

00:00:11.238 --> 00:00:13.830
"Collect all six prizes."

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.745
Each box of cereal has one prize,

00:00:16.745 --> 00:00:19.622
and each prize is a
equally likely to appear

00:00:19.622 --> 00:00:21.791
in any given box.

00:00:21.791 --> 00:00:24.469
Amanda wonders how many boxes it takes

00:00:24.469 --> 00:00:27.219
on average to get all six prizes.

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.460
So there's several ways to
approach this for Amanda.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.267
She could try to figure out a
mathematical way to determine

00:00:35.267 --> 00:00:36.714
what is the expected number

00:00:36.714 --> 00:00:38.752
of boxes she would need to collect

00:00:38.752 --> 00:00:41.734
on average to get all six prizes,

00:00:41.734 --> 00:00:44.808
or she could run some random numbers

00:00:44.808 --> 00:00:48.990
to simulate collecting box
after box after box and

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.533
figure out multiple trials on
how many boxes does it take

00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:54.651
to win all six prizes.

00:00:54.651 --> 00:00:57.262
So for example, she could say, "All right,

00:00:57.262 --> 00:01:00.790
each box is gonna have one of six prizes,"

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.097
so there could be...

00:01:02.097 --> 00:01:04.753
She could assign a number
for each of the prizes,

00:01:04.753 --> 00:01:07.503
one, two, three, four, five, six,

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:12.082
and then she could have a
computer generate a random string

00:01:12.082 --> 00:01:16.684
of numbers, maybe something
that looks like this,

00:01:16.684 --> 00:01:19.561
and the general method, she
could start at the left here,

00:01:19.561 --> 00:01:22.449
and each new number she gets she can say,

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:24.847
"Hey, this is like getting a cereal box,

00:01:24.847 --> 00:01:27.849
and then it's going to
tell me which prize I got."

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:30.375
So she starts her first experiment.

00:01:30.375 --> 00:01:32.476
She'll start here at the
left, and she'll say,

00:01:32.476 --> 00:01:35.128
"Okay, the first cereal
box of this experiment

00:01:35.128 --> 00:01:38.992
of this simulation I
got prize number one,"

00:01:38.992 --> 00:01:40.045
and she'll keep going.

00:01:40.045 --> 00:01:42.210
The next one, she gets prize number five.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.252
Then the third one, she
gets prize number six.

00:01:44.252 --> 00:01:46.909
Then the fourth one, she
gets prize number six again,

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.780
and she will keep going until
she gets all six prizes.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.615
You might say, "Well, look.

00:01:51.615 --> 00:01:54.709
There are numbers here that
aren't one through six."

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:55.582
There's zero.

00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:56.415
There's seven.

00:01:56.415 --> 00:01:57.847
There's eight or nine.

00:01:57.847 --> 00:02:00.459
Well, for those numbers,
she could just ignore them.

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:03.501
She could just pretend
like they aren't there and

00:02:03.501 --> 00:02:06.091
just keep going past them.

00:02:06.091 --> 00:02:08.224
So why don't you pause
this video and do it

00:02:08.224 --> 00:02:10.030
for the first experiment.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.591
On this first experiment,
using these numbers,

00:02:12.591 --> 00:02:15.264
assuming that this is the
first box that you are getting

00:02:15.264 --> 00:02:18.612
in your simulation, how
many boxes would you need

00:02:18.612 --> 00:02:21.929
in order to get all six prizes?

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:24.413
So let me make a table here.

00:02:24.413 --> 00:02:26.580
So this is the experiment,

00:02:28.421 --> 00:02:30.595
and then in the second column,

00:02:30.595 --> 00:02:33.170
I'm gonna say number of boxes,

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.337
number of boxes you would have
to get in that simulation.

00:02:38.454 --> 00:02:42.158
So maybe I'll do the first
one in this blue color.

00:02:42.158 --> 00:02:45.274
So we're in the first
simulation, so one box,

00:02:45.274 --> 00:02:46.532
we got the one.

00:02:46.532 --> 00:02:48.163
Actually, maybe I'll check things off,

00:02:48.163 --> 00:02:52.863
so we have to get a one,
a two, a three, a four,

00:02:52.863 --> 00:02:55.181
a five, and a six.

00:02:55.181 --> 00:02:56.390
So let's see.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.907
We have a one.

00:02:57.907 --> 00:02:59.585
I'll check that off.

00:02:59.585 --> 00:03:01.524
We have a five.

00:03:01.524 --> 00:03:03.167
I'll check that off.

00:03:03.167 --> 00:03:04.250
We get a six.

00:03:05.098 --> 00:03:06.981
I'll check that off.

00:03:06.981 --> 00:03:08.798
Well, the next box we got another six.

00:03:08.798 --> 00:03:09.978
We've already had that prize,

00:03:09.978 --> 00:03:11.986
but we're gonna keep getting boxes.

00:03:11.986 --> 00:03:14.653
Then the next box, we get a two.

00:03:15.896 --> 00:03:18.646
Then the next box, we get a four.

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.207
Then the next box, the number is a seven,

00:03:22.207 --> 00:03:25.464
so we will just ignore
this right over here.

00:03:25.464 --> 00:03:27.609
The box after that, we get a six,

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:29.774
but we already have that prize.

00:03:29.774 --> 00:03:31.714
Then we ignore the next box, zero.

00:03:31.714 --> 00:03:33.515
That doesn't give us a prize.

00:03:33.515 --> 00:03:36.187
We assume that that didn't even happen,

00:03:36.187 --> 00:03:38.098
and then we would go to the number three,

00:03:38.098 --> 00:03:41.067
which is the last prize that we need.

00:03:41.067 --> 00:03:44.344
So how many boxes did
we have to go through?

00:03:44.344 --> 00:03:46.620
Well, we would only count the valid ones,

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.113
the ones that gave a valid prize

00:03:49.113 --> 00:03:52.680
between the numbers one through
six, including one and six.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.513
So let's see.

00:03:53.513 --> 00:03:57.680
We went through one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven,

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:01.843
eight boxes in the first experiment,

00:04:01.843 --> 00:04:03.304
so experiment number one,

00:04:03.304 --> 00:04:07.220
it took us eight boxes
to get all six prizes.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.881
Let's do another experiment
'cause this doesn't tell us

00:04:09.881 --> 00:04:12.449
that on average she
would expect eight boxes.

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:13.282
This just meant that

00:04:13.282 --> 00:04:15.594
on this first experiment
it took eight boxes.

00:04:15.594 --> 00:04:17.290
If you wanted to figure out on average,

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.457
you want to do many experiments,

00:04:19.457 --> 00:04:21.437
and the more experiments you do,

00:04:21.437 --> 00:04:24.255
the better that that
average is going to...

00:04:24.255 --> 00:04:26.702
The more likely that your
average is going to predict

00:04:26.702 --> 00:04:30.155
what it actually takes on
average to get all six prizes.

00:04:30.155 --> 00:04:33.108
So now let's do our second
experiment, and remember,

00:04:33.108 --> 00:04:36.053
it's important that these
are truly random numbers,

00:04:36.053 --> 00:04:40.676
and so we will now start
at the first valid number.

00:04:40.676 --> 00:04:45.260
So we have a two, so this
is our second experiment,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.943
and we got a two.

00:04:46.943 --> 00:04:48.026
We got a one.

00:04:49.034 --> 00:04:50.951
We can ignore this eight.

00:04:50.951 --> 00:04:52.007
Then we get a two again.

00:04:52.007 --> 00:04:53.791
We've already had that prize.

00:04:53.791 --> 00:04:55.213
Ignore the nine.

00:04:55.213 --> 00:04:58.806
Five, that's a prize we
need in this experiment.

00:04:58.806 --> 00:05:01.191
Nine, we can ignore,

00:05:01.191 --> 00:05:04.022
and then four, haven't
gotten that prize yet

00:05:04.022 --> 00:05:05.909
in this experiment.

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:09.339
Three, haven't gotten that
prize yet in this experiment.

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:11.327
One, we already got that prize.

00:05:11.327 --> 00:05:13.334
Three, we already got that prize.

00:05:13.334 --> 00:05:14.792
Three, already got that prize.

00:05:14.792 --> 00:05:17.276
Two, two, already got those prizes.

00:05:17.276 --> 00:05:18.515
Zero.

00:05:18.515 --> 00:05:21.733
We already got all of
these prizes over here.

00:05:21.733 --> 00:05:22.967
We can ignore the zero.

00:05:22.967 --> 00:05:24.038
Already got that prize,

00:05:24.038 --> 00:05:27.690
and finally, we get prize number six.

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.110
So how many boxes did we need
in that second experiment?

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.943
Well, let's see.

00:05:32.943 --> 00:05:36.276
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

00:05:37.856 --> 00:05:40.189
eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13,

00:05:41.874 --> 00:05:43.624
14, 15, 16, 17 boxes,

00:05:47.123 --> 00:05:51.290
so in experiment 2, I needed
17, or Amanda, needed 17 boxes,

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.014
and she can keep going.

00:05:55.014 --> 00:05:56.631
Let's do this one more time.

00:05:56.631 --> 00:05:59.255
This is strangely fun.

00:05:59.255 --> 00:06:01.811
So experiment three, and remember,

00:06:01.811 --> 00:06:03.721
we only want to look at the valid numbers.

00:06:03.721 --> 00:06:05.474
We'll ignore the invalid numbers,

00:06:05.474 --> 00:06:08.184
the ones that don't give
us a valid prize number.

00:06:08.184 --> 00:06:10.434
So four, we get that prize.

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:13.220
These are all invalid, in fact,

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.372
and then we go to five.

00:06:15.372 --> 00:06:17.047
We get that prize.

00:06:17.047 --> 00:06:18.738
Five, we already have it.

00:06:18.738 --> 00:06:20.637
We get the two prize.

00:06:20.637 --> 00:06:22.161
Seven and eight are invalid.

00:06:22.161 --> 00:06:23.526
Seven's invalid.

00:06:23.526 --> 00:06:25.812
Six, we get that prize.

00:06:25.812 --> 00:06:27.537
Seven's invalid.

00:06:27.537 --> 00:06:29.735
One, we got that prize.

00:06:29.735 --> 00:06:31.441
One, we already got it.

00:06:31.441 --> 00:06:33.098
Nine's invalid.

00:06:33.098 --> 00:06:34.473
Two, we already got it.

00:06:34.473 --> 00:06:36.414
Nine is invalid.

00:06:36.414 --> 00:06:38.921
One, we already got the one prize,

00:06:38.921 --> 00:06:41.404
and then finally, we
get prize number three,

00:06:41.404 --> 00:06:43.117
which was the missing prize.

00:06:43.117 --> 00:06:47.608
So how many boxes, valid boxes,
did we have to go through?

00:06:47.608 --> 00:06:48.441
Let's see.

00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:51.191
One, two, three, four, five, six,

00:06:52.303 --> 00:06:54.220
seven, eight, nine, 10.

00:06:56.855 --> 00:07:01.159
10, so with only three
experiments, what was our average?

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:02.418
Well, with these three experiments,

00:07:02.418 --> 00:07:06.585
our average is going to be eight
plus 17 plus 10 over three,

00:07:07.738 --> 00:07:08.571
so let's see.

00:07:08.571 --> 00:07:10.738
This is 25, 35 over three,

00:07:11.883 --> 00:07:14.883
which is equal to 11 2/3.

00:07:16.421 --> 00:07:17.254
Now, do we know

00:07:17.254 --> 00:07:20.223
that this is the true theoretical
expected number of boxes

00:07:20.223 --> 00:07:21.452
that you would need to get?

00:07:21.452 --> 00:07:24.458
No, we don't know that, but
the more experiments we run,

00:07:24.458 --> 00:07:26.717
the closer our averages likely get

00:07:26.717 --> 00:07:29.384
to the true theoretical average.
