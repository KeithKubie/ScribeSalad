00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.360
We're asked to find the height
of a cylinder with a volume of

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:10.520
16 pi n to the fifth and a
base whose radius is 2n.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.870
So just as a little bit of
review of how you find the

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.930
volume of a cylinder, let
me draw a cylinder here.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:21.300
So if that is the top of my
cylinder and that is the

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.560
height of-- I'm not drawing
it as straight as I could.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.790
If that is the height of my
cylinder and if this cylinder

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.530
was transparent and you could
see the base, which is just

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.730
like the top of it, It would
look something like that.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.330
I should draw that second one
with a dotted line to show you

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.950
that you would only see it if
our cylinder was transparent.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.010
That's our cylinder.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.430
The volume of a cylinder, if
the height is h-- So if our

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.760
height of our cylinder is h, and
that if you had an area of

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.610
either the top or the bottom,
either the base of the top of

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:01.240
it of a, the volume of your
cylinder is going to be equal

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.050
to the height times the area
of the top or the base.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.890
Depending on if you turn this
over, this would be the base.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.870
Times the area of the base.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.610
Now, what do they
tell us here?

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.530
We want to find the height.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.430
They say find the height.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.230
So we need to solve for h.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.350
This is what we don't know.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.050
Of a cylinder with a volume
of 16 pi n to the fifth.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.880
So they tell us the volume.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.780
They tell us the volume is
16 pi n to the fifth.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.490
So that right there is
16 pi n to the fifth.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.460
And then they tell us a base
whose radius is 2n.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.730
So they're not telling
us the area, they're

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.290
telling us the radius.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.290
They're telling us that this
radius right here is 2n right

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.470
over there.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.250
Now, if you know the radius of
a circle, you know the area.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.050
This top and the bottom,
these are circles.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.330
That's what makes
it a cylinder.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.630
These are circles.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.190
So if you know the radius,
you know this area.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.370
Area is equal to pi r squared.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.480
One of the first things
we learn in geometry.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.539
And so in this situation,
it would be equal to pi.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.640
Our radius, they
tell us is 2n.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.110
So pi times 2n squared.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.020
And we know this is the same
thing, so area is equal to,

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.040
what is this? pi times
2 squared, which

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.080
is 4 times n squared.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.230
4n squared.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.390
Or if we just rearranged
it, area is

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.950
equal to 4 pi n squared.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.780
So that's the area, that
right over there.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.020
And so now we can solve for h.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.140
We have 16 pi n to the fifth.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.490
That's our volume.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.160
That is equal to our height
times the area.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.140
Times the area of the base or
the top of our cylinder.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.790
Times 4 pi n squared.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.080
Now, a good place to start if
we're trying to solve for h or

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.900
actually, it'll get us right
there immediately, is let's

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.430
divide both sides of this
equation by 4 pi n squared.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.330
So you divide the right side
by 4 pi n squared.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.130
Divide the left side
by 4 pi n squared.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.550
You have to do it
to both sides.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.310
On the right-hand side,
these cancel out.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.590
That was the whole point.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.500
And you are left with h is equal
to this thing over here.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.640
We can simplify this
a good bit.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.270
We have a pi divided by a
pi, so those cancel out.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.300
We have a 16 divided by 4,
that cancels out to a 4

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.080
divided by a 1, or just a 4.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.470
And then you have n to the
fifth over n squared.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.920
So when you have an exponent
in the denominator, you can

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.250
subtract it from the exponent
in the numerator.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.750
So this is going to
be 4 right here.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:46.750
Or 4/1.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.010
I'll just write it as 4.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.140
The pi's disappeared.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.850
Times n to the 5 minus
2 power, which is 3.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.930
n to the third power.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:57.930
And we're done.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.970
The height of the cylinder
is 4n to the third power.
