00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:11.350
 
I would say the most fascinating part

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:11.360
I would say the most fascinating part
 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.480
I would say the most fascinating part
about saving that really motivates most

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490
about saving that really motivates most
 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.849
about saving that really motivates most
people and in particular young people is

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:15.859
people and in particular young people is
 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:18.790
people and in particular young people is
this whole notion of compound growth now

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800
this whole notion of compound growth now
 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.470
this whole notion of compound growth now
you know we all learn this in our in our

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480
you know we all learn this in our in our
 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.660
you know we all learn this in our in our
math classes but what happens is is we

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670
math classes but what happens is is we
 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.070
math classes but what happens is is we
save a little money and then it earns

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080
save a little money and then it earns
 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.770
save a little money and then it earns
interest or return then our interests

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:26.780
interest or return then our interests
 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.450
interest or return then our interests
and our in the amount we save starts to

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460
and our in the amount we save starts to
 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.740
and our in the amount we save starts to
grow itself and it just keeps

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750
grow itself and it just keeps
 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.630
grow itself and it just keeps
snowballing in fact i'll give you a

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640
snowballing in fact i'll give you a
 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.850
snowballing in fact i'll give you a
little a little example which is

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860
little a little example which is
 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.069
little a little example which is
unrealistic but it really shows compound

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079
unrealistic but it really shows compound
 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:38.559
unrealistic but it really shows compound
growth if you if you had a penny and it

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:38.569
growth if you if you had a penny and it
 

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:42.250
growth if you if you had a penny and it
doubled every day for 30 days that penny

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260
doubled every day for 30 days that penny
 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.889
doubled every day for 30 days that penny
would grow to over 10 million dollars

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899
would grow to over 10 million dollars
 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:47.439
would grow to over 10 million dollars
now certainly we are money doesn't grow

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:47.449
now certainly we are money doesn't grow
 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:49.719
now certainly we are money doesn't grow
that quickly but if you show a young

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:49.729
that quickly but if you show a young
 

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:52.180
that quickly but if you show a young
person just even you know I'm having an

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190
person just even you know I'm having an
 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.750
person just even you know I'm having an
eight to ten percent growth rate the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760
eight to ten percent growth rate the
 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.549
eight to ten percent growth rate the
amount of money that you will have in a

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559
amount of money that you will have in a
 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.279
amount of money that you will have in a
later age is really life-changing and

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289
later age is really life-changing and
 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.309
later age is really life-changing and
very motivating and so that I think

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:03.319
very motivating and so that I think
 

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:06.039
very motivating and so that I think
compound growth is really the key to

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049
compound growth is really the key to
 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.380
compound growth is really the key to
that which also the other key or

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390
that which also the other key or
 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.300
that which also the other key or
motivator is having options in your life

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310
motivator is having options in your life
 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.830
motivator is having options in your life
being able to do the things that you

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840
being able to do the things that you
 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:19.060
being able to do the things that you
otherwise never ever could do

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070
 
 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.950
 
well that again that's this whole

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960
well that again that's this whole
 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.679
well that again that's this whole
concept of compound growth that's you

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689
concept of compound growth that's you
 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.139
concept of compound growth that's you
know earning interest or or having

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149
know earning interest or or having
 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.770
know earning interest or or having
growth on your dollar and and so what

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780
growth on your dollar and and so what
 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.859
growth on your dollar and and so what
happens is the growth itself starts to

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869
happens is the growth itself starts to
 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.050
happens is the growth itself starts to
grow and earn income on it on it as well

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060
grow and earn income on it on it as well
 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.469
grow and earn income on it on it as well
so it's just again a snowball effect

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479
so it's just again a snowball effect
 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.480
so it's just again a snowball effect
where it grows and grows and grows

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490
where it grows and grows and grows
 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.209
where it grows and grows and grows
really fast similar to how that penny

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:43.219
really fast similar to how that penny
 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:47.240
really fast similar to how that penny
grew and so saving today lets you know

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250
grew and so saving today lets you know
 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.760
grew and so saving today lets you know
today allows it to grow for more

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770
today allows it to grow for more
 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:58.339
today allows it to grow for more
tomorrow what we try to do is get the

00:01:58.339 --> 00:01:58.349
tomorrow what we try to do is get the
 

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:00.199
tomorrow what we try to do is get the
word out to as many young people as

00:02:00.199 --> 00:02:00.209
word out to as many young people as
 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:03.050
word out to as many young people as
possible at Schwab we say if you're in

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060
possible at Schwab we say if you're in
 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.839
possible at Schwab we say if you're in
your teens or in your 20s save ten

00:02:05.839 --> 00:02:05.849
your teens or in your 20s save ten
 

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:08.119
your teens or in your 20s save ten
percent of your income for the rest of

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129
percent of your income for the rest of
 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.800
percent of your income for the rest of
your life and you will be financially

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810
your life and you will be financially
 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.150
your life and you will be financially
secure but if you wait until your 30s

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160
secure but if you wait until your 30s
 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.860
secure but if you wait until your 30s
you're going to have to say fifteen to

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870
you're going to have to say fifteen to
 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.690
you're going to have to say fifteen to
twenty percent of your income and then

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700
twenty percent of your income and then
 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.690
twenty percent of your income and then
in your 40s we say ouch you know then

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700
in your 40s we say ouch you know then
 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.009
in your 40s we say ouch you know then
you're going to mean twenty-five percent

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019
you're going to mean twenty-five percent
 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:23.629
you're going to mean twenty-five percent
of your income that's pretty difficult

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:23.639
of your income that's pretty difficult
 

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:27.050
of your income that's pretty difficult
to do so the sooner you can start the

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060
to do so the sooner you can start the
 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:37.020
to do so the sooner you can start the
easier is on your pocketbook

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030
 
 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.090
