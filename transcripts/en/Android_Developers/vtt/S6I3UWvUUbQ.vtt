00:00:08.364 --> 00:00:11.360
TODD KERPELMAN: Hello, internet,
and welcome to yet

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.550
another episode of "Game On."
I'm Todd Kerpelman.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.210
I'm a Developer Advocate here
on the Play Games team.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.970
DUNCAN CURTIS: Hey,
I'm Duncan Curtis.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.110
I'm a product manager on
the Google Play team.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.590
And I've just launched the
Google Play Games app.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.930
TODD KERPELMAN: Oh, well, that's
very convenient because

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.010
that happens to bring
us to this week's

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.780
episode, Episode Six.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.250
We're going to be talking about
the Play Games app.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.260
Before we get into that though,
let's talk about some

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.250
other news and updates.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.620
The first thing is that some
of you might have noticed

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.670
there is a new update to
Play Services that has

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:43.400
been rolling out.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.360
And I think by the time this
video launches, it should be

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.830
out to all of the world.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.650
What's new for you on the Play
Games Services side of things?

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.470
Not much, so it's not a very
exciting announcement.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.290
But we did introduce a number
of bug fixes, a lot in Real

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.500
Time Multiplayer.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.770
And there's been this image
loader crash, that I know has

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.240
been driving people crazy over
on the public bug database.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.370
So that has finally
been addressed.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:10.680
Thanks everyone for
your patience.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.060
And by the way, proof
that the public bug

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.450
database actually works.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.570
That's how we caught this one.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.500
So remember, visit that.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.350
And we'll add on a link here.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.700
And report any issues that
you find because

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.890
apparently it works.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.420
In addition, if you can't get
enough of me, if you're

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.570
saying, once every two weeks
is just not enough Todd, I

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.500
have started a new "DevBytes"
series, which is introducing

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.890
Play Games for iOS.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.980
It's a series of screen casts
where we're going to go

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.250
through adding Sign In,
Achievements, Leader Boards,

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.130
some sharing on Google+
to an iOS application.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.920
So go ahead and follow along or
share it with your favorite

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.630
iOS developer.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.700
DUNCAN CURTIS: Are you
saying that's like

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.210
now 100% more Todd?

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.280
TODD KERPELMAN: 100%
more Todd.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.835
DUNCAN CURTIS: That's
fantastic.

00:01:52.835 --> 00:01:54.210
TODD KERPELMAN: It's actually
going to be

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.020
like 600% more Todd.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.560
This is like three
times a week.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.240
DUNCAN CURTIS: This is news.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.370
TODD KERPELMAN: It's honestly
more Todd than most of you

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:02.190
really want.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.890
So I won't be offended if
that's too much Todd.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.390
Anyway, we should go on to our
main topic here, which is the

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.920
Play Games app.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.560
Yes, Duncan, you've been in
charge of this thing now.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.940
I know we just launched
a release.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.270
Is there anything exciting
in this week's release?

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.660
DUNCAN CURTIS: Yes.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.270
Actually, we've got some
really cool stuff.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.320
So first, I'll discussed a
little bit about the app.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.250
And then I'll maybe go through
and talk about some things

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.720
that have updated.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.410
You all know the
Play Games app.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.200
It's the hub of gaming for
Android as it grows.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.460
And more features
are rolling out.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.700
It's becoming the place you
go when you want to

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.150
do gaming on Android.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.310
And that's a good for
developers, because now we've

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.370
got a place for everyone
to go, not just a

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.250
vertical in the store.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.240
We've now got our own app.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.400
It also lets people game with
each other, find each other,

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.630
track their progress in your
games, your games, where you

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.620
mark your own achievements and
let people update them.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.470
And they get to track their
progress and also discover new

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.220
titles, discover some of your
titles, discover what their

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.130
friends are playing.

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.010
Maybe their friends are
playing your game now.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.550
So I think, perhaps it's
best if I show you.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.010
TODD KERPELMAN: That
would be good.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.354
Let's go to a demo.

00:03:16.354 --> 00:03:19.960
DUNCAN CURTIS: Cool, so here's
the Home screen of the

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.260
destination app as everyone
knows and loves.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.840
We've got the My games section
at the top, which shows all

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.040
your Play Enabled games.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.080
TODD KERPELMAN: So now, are
these all games that you have

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.300
installed on the device?

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.890
DUNCAN CURTIS: No, it's whatever
you've played most

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.580
recently on the Play
enabled games.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.700
So you could have
been playing--

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.140
just a hop back to you
"DevBytes" series, you could

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.570
have been playing a Play-Enabled
game on iOS.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.120
And it will still
show up here.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.110
TODD KERPELMAN: Gotcha.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.450
OK.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.520
So basically, this list is
populated based on the most

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.660
recent games I've been
playing, using

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.150
the Play Games service.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.570
DUNCAN CURTIS: Correct.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:52.475
TODD KERPELMAN: OK.

00:03:52.475 --> 00:03:57.270
DUNCAN CURTIS: It also, for the
users, it shows the number

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.950
of achievements they've got,
to sort of drive people who

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.930
really love to get that
100% achievement

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.180
complete on a game.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.000
If they can see here that,
you've got your 28 of 29

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.880
achievements, very likely to
jump back into your game, even

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.320
if it's down in the fourth
or fifth slot.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.230
TODD KERPELMAN: OK.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.420
DUNCAN CURTIS: Next we have
the Player section.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.440
These are all of your G+ friends
who are Play enabled,

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.720
so people who are actually
gaming and

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.875
have been gaming recently.

00:04:23.875 --> 00:04:24.590
TODD KERPELMAN: Gotcha.

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.650
So this is people in my Google+
Circles who have used

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.500
a game, using Play Services.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.810
So basically, we know,
hey, these guys have

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.640
signed into a game.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.955
They're gaming. they're probably
people you can play a

00:04:35.955 --> 00:04:36.490
multiplayer game with.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:37.050
DUNCAN CURTIS: Exactly.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.570
As you can see, here
is Ellie Powers.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.920
And she's been playing our
fantastic sample app,

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.730
Nostalgic Racer.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.720
So if I jump on into--

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.795
TODD KERPELMAN: How did
you know she was

00:04:45.795 --> 00:04:46.300
playing Nostalgic Racer?

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.580
DUNCAN CURTIS: So if I jump back
up for one second, see,

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.875
in the bottom right-hand
corner, just here--

00:04:49.875 --> 00:04:50.760
TODD KERPELMAN: Oh, yeah.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.650
There's that little icon.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:52.750
DUNCAN CURTIS: Little
icons, yeah.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.370
So it's really great because
if you're a big fan of

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.410
Nostalgic Racer, as I clearly
am, and say, for example,

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.660
Triple Town-- shout out to Spry
Fox, great game-- so if

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.580
you're a fan of one of these
games, it makes you much more

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.810
likely to be like, hey, I should
go check out other

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.400
games that this friend
has been playing.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.850
So yeah, I'll dive in
there a little bit

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.460
more deeply in a minute.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.940
Here we have our
Featured games.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.430
So this is where we're showing
the list of featured titles

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:20.600
that are Play enabled.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.020
Now, we have just released one
update here as well, which

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.610
I'll point out.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.270
It's that, installed or
purchased titles will no

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.620
longer show up in this list, if
there's more featured games

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.162
for you to show.

00:05:32.162 --> 00:05:34.615
TODD KERPELMAN: So if I already
had Monster Shooter--

00:05:34.615 --> 00:05:36.850
DUNCAN CURTIS: It would no
longer show up in this row,

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.210
unless you had all of our
featured games, which is a

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.780
happy problem.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:41.792
TODD KERPELMAN: OK.

00:05:41.792 --> 00:05:44.720
DUNCAN CURTIS: What that really
means is that, for

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.640
developers, specifically for
developers, this is going to

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.820
be really important.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.100
Because if you do make our
Featured list, then it doesn't

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.950
matter if your number one
in the Featured list.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.760
You still have a really great
chance of getting high levels

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.835
of visibility in the
Play Games app.

00:05:57.835 --> 00:06:00.250
TODD KERPELMAN: So now,
how do I get on this

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:01.135
Featured games list?

00:06:01.135 --> 00:06:03.660
DUNCAN CURTIS: Featured games
list is a hand curated list by

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:04.830
our BD team.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.680
TODD KERPELMAN: OK, so I've
got to make a game that

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.900
impresses our BD team?

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:08.460
DUNCAN CURTIS: Exactly.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.760
TODD KERPELMAN: I should
probably enable Game Services?

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.080
DUNCAN CURTIS: That's a
minimum requirement.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.490
TODD KERPELMAN: OK.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.570
And I'm assuming this list-- is
this a completely separate

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.520
list than, say, some
of the featured

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.110
lists in the Play store?

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.960
DUNCAN CURTIS: Correct.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:22.480
That's correct.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:28.130
There's a completely separate
list that we take care of,

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.030
because we're gamers.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.340
We what we want.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.890
And we like we like a really
great integrations.

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.600
So there's some really good
example integrations, if you

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.130
check that out Dev Docs,
for great ways to

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:39.430
integrate our service.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.910
There are basic ways to do it.

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:42.100
And then, there are
really cool and

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.450
impressive ways to do it.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.650
So we're always looking
for that

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:46.740
dare to be great situation.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.810
TODD KERPELMAN: So these tend
to be good games that also

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.185
have really nice integrations.

00:06:50.185 --> 00:06:50.920
DUNCAN CURTIS: Yes.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.085
It certainly makes
it more common.

00:06:52.085 --> 00:06:53.720
TODD KERPELMAN: OK.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.355
Yeah, keep going.

00:06:54.355 --> 00:06:57.270
DUNCAN CURTIS: So the other
list is, You may know.

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.480
So You may know is a place for
you to find people that,

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.090
Google+ back end has said, hey,
these people you know, so

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.770
a good place for you to most
likely find your friends.

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:10.090
TODD KERPELMAN: So are these
people already in my Circles?

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:13.440
These are people not in my
Circles, but Google+ thinks I

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.310
probably know them.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:15.360
DUNCAN CURTIS: You probably
know them.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.380
There's probably
a good chance.

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.440
TODD KERPELMAN: And are these
people necessarily gamers?

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.835
DUNCAN CURTIS: Not
at this stage.

00:07:19.835 --> 00:07:21.236
TODD KERPELMAN: OK.

00:07:21.236 --> 00:07:24.030
DUNCAN CURTIS: However, you're
probably going to know which

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:25.580
ones of your friends
are gamers anyway.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.336
TODD KERPELMAN: Gotcha.

00:07:27.336 --> 00:07:32.670
DUNCAN CURTIS: So one of the
other updates we've recently

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:37.580
released is that, some of these
rows for Players is and

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.860
for You may know, when you jump
into a next level down--

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:45.210
so for example, if I jump into
a player and jump back up, if

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:48.300
I had more than three players
here, if I had more than the

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:51.390
maximum row number, we would
actually cycle between some of

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:54.640
the players, so that you can
see a bit more of what your

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.700
friends are doing.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.540
That also applies to the
You may know row.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:00.520
It's that we want to really just
filter through that list

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.290
a little more quickly and let
you get a chance to see some

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:03.830
more people.

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:04.220
TODD KERPELMAN: You're right.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:05.310
That list looks different.

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:07.180
DUNCAN CURTIS: It is different
from the last time.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:08.080
TODD KERPELMAN: Wow, magic.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.130
DUNCAN CURTIS: Yeah.

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:13.020
So just minor tweaks and
tunes, here and there.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:14.780
I did want to jump in and just
show you a little bit of the

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.780
cool thing with Players.

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:18.660
We mentioned earlier that
Ellie had been playing

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:19.360
Nostalgic Racer.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.630
And as I love it, I would
like to see what

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:22.990
else Ellie is playing.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:27.200
Here, I can see all the other
Play enabled games that Ellie

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.220
has been playing.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.980
And I can jump straight into
one, like Triple Town.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.090
Wow, here's a little bit
about Triple Town.

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:36.380
Here are the game features
that it uses.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.360
As you can see there at the top,
it uses Achievements and

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.830
Leader Boards.

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:41.890
And since I haven't got the game
installed yet, I haven't

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:43.200
got any Achievements.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.050
But I can check the Achievements
out, before I

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:47.850
even own the game.

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:53.670
So this is a good reason for
developers to implement really

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:57.830
great art and useful text that
can be explained to users

00:08:57.830 --> 00:08:58.660
quite easily.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:00.900
Because I can see if there's
interesting things here to do.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.210
TODD KERPELMAN: OK, now, I
noticed you got here by going

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:04.400
through Ellie's profile.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.960
Can I see Ellie's
achievements?

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.285
DUNCAN CURTIS: Not yet.

00:09:07.285 --> 00:09:08.690
TODD KERPELMAN: OK.

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:11.850
Not yet, meaning that it's a
good idea and maybe just--

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:13.300
DUNCAN CURTIS: It is
a fantastic idea.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.060
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:15.880
That's what I want to hear.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.130
Let's go back to the About
section for one second.

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:19.930
Where does this information
come from?

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:21.045
Where do we get these badges?

00:09:21.045 --> 00:09:22.310
Is that automatic?

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:23.440
Where is this description?

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:26.680
So the badging features come
from-- when you enable your

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:28.950
game in Dev Console, you get
to say, hey, these are the

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:30.190
features I'm using.

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:32.500
We have some smarts on the
back end that determine

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.000
legitimate use of the service.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And if that passes, then your
badging will show up, both

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.310
here and in the Play store.

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.590
TODD KERPELMAN: OK.

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:41.540
So that's basically--

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.390
I know Triple Town has gone,
and they've added

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:43.900
achievements.

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:45.160
And they obviously have
leaderboards.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.120
And so our system has basically
detected that.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.220
And they sort of get the
badges automatically.

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.300
There's nothing additional the
developer needs to do.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:52.840
DUNCAN CURTIS: No.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.030
You're correct.

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:55.850
As soon as they start sending
us the signals and have

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:58.420
everything enabled in the Dev
Console, it just works.

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:00.820
The description is being pulled
from the Play store.

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.200
And we're looking at updating
some features in the future,

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.140
to make this more interactive,
more interesting.

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:06.550
But this is where we
are for the moment.

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:08.320
TODD KERPELMAN: Wait, is it
actually from the Play store?

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.385
Or is it from the Developer
Console?

00:10:09.385 --> 00:10:10.450
DUNCAN CURTIS: Oh, sorry.

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:11.360
It's from the Developer
Console.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.610
We just did the update.

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:14.250
You got me, well played.

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:15.122
TODD KERPELMAN: Thanks.

00:10:15.122 --> 00:10:16.590
See, I know a thing or two.

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:18.310
DUNCAN CURTIS: We just recently
released an update to

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:20.160
the Dev Console, where you'll be
able to do some copying and

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.920
pasting automatically,
which will be nice.

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.330
So from here, users
can jump into the

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.270
Play store to purchase.

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:29.860
Or they can just launch the game
in the top right, where

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:31.970
it's got free, over here.

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:33.310
TODD KERPELMAN: So clicking
on that will take

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:34.470
me to the Play store?

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:35.805
DUNCAN CURTIS: For now, it
will take you to the Play

00:10:35.805 --> 00:10:37.000
store, where you can install.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.170
And then, if you have this
installed from here, you can

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:40.640
just click Play, straight
from there.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.070
TODD KERPELMAN: Gotcha.

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:44.600
You say, for now, meaning that,
you've got other ideas

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.870
maybe in the future for what
that button could do?

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:49.810
DUNCAN CURTIS: It goes
to the Play store.

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:51.950
TODD KERPELMAN: I'm going to
get you to commit to some

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:53.816
future feature at some point.

00:10:53.816 --> 00:10:54.690
DUNCAN CURTIS: Yeah.

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:55.810
So we talked about
achievements.

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:56.880
I'd like to talk about
leaderboards a

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:57.780
little bit as well.

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:01.470
So just for developers to know,
you can have more than

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:02.310
one leaderboard.

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:05.400
So you can have your
high score.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.840
Let's say, it was
a high score.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.000
As you can see here, you can
have daily, weekly, or

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.162
all-time leaderboards.

00:11:12.162 --> 00:11:15.410
That's up to the user
to take a look at.

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:17.710
But you can also have multiple
leaderboards.

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:21.670
So for a car racing game, this
could be drift versus drag

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:26.850
racing versus carjacking, if
you're in GTA or something.

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:32.720
But this is the ability for
people to compete in multiple

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.910
different ways, how they
want to compete.

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:43.610
So within here, the player can
see people within their

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:46.640
Circles that are competing and
also the entire public

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:47.940
leaderboard.

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.460
So this gives people a chance
to compete in multiple

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:51.810
different ways within
your game.

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:52.965
So integrate leaderboards.

00:11:52.965 --> 00:11:53.675
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:11:53.675 --> 00:11:55.200
It sounds good.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.620
So I was going to say, we
provide the ability for

00:11:58.620 --> 00:11:59.830
developers to show leaderboards

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:00.825
in their games already.

00:12:00.825 --> 00:12:04.220
But I suppose the advantage here
is, I don't need to go

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:07.050
and install the game before I
get to see the leaderboards.

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:07.470
DUNCAN CURTIS: Correct.

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:09.960
So you can go check out the
leaderboard of any game.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.470
So I don't even have
Triple Town

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:13.490
installed on this account.

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:16.630
Trust me, I have it
on other accounts.

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:19.810
But you can go check it out and
see what's a good score.

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:21.000
You can also get an idea.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.940
If a friend of yours has been
bragging about getting two

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:25.380
million in Triple Town.

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:27.075
And you go to the leaderboard,
and you're like, but 28

00:12:27.075 --> 00:12:29.680
million is what the
top guy has.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.160
Then you can quickly
get a feel for how

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.570
your friend is doing.

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:36.600
I would like to point out that,
you mentioned something

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.190
interesting about Leaderboards
and Achievements.

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:43.260
Developers can use our APIs and
implement whatever user

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.610
interface they want in their
game, if they choose.

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:49.200
We do provide client UIs, so
that everyone has a basic

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:53.000
experience and is really quick
to get up and going.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.400
But irrespective of the way you
implement on your side,

00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:01.080
they'll show up here, in the of
Play Games app, like this.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.820
That way, there's a consistent
experience for users in the

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:06.810
gaming hub.

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:09.290
I think that's about all I
really wanted to talk about

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:10.220
for the moment.

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:13.040
I'm really happy with
this minor update.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.360
We had some bug fixes,
which is nice, a

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.700
little bit more stability.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:20.550
The changes are a little bit
more flow through of the

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:22.760
players in the different cards,
so you can see more.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.770
And we've got lots more exciting
things to come.

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:25.500
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.240
Well, that sounds good.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:32.390
Well then, maybe let's just jump
into some follow up Q&amp;A.

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:34.930
Starting with-- so where
is this app?

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:35.290
How do I get it?

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:37.670
DUNCAN CURTIS: You can get
it in the Play store.

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:40.920
If you look for Play Games,
you can get it there.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.630
And some devices come with
it pre-installed.

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:44.600
TODD KERPELMAN: Do you
know which ones?

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.720
DUNCAN CURTIS: It's
ever increasing.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:47.960
TODD KERPELMAN: OK.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.283
I do know that, right now, if
you get the new Nexus 7, it

00:13:50.283 --> 00:13:50.910
comes with that installed.

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:52.700
DUNCAN CURTIS: Nexus
7, it does.

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.220
TODD KERPELMAN: OK,
so Nexus 7--

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:57.295
and so the people that are using
the Play Games app right

00:13:57.295 --> 00:13:59.260
now are people that have
actually gone out and said, I

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:00.380
want to install this app.

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:02.075
And so they're probably
a good audience.

00:14:02.075 --> 00:14:02.730
DUNCAN CURTIS: Yeah.

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:03.730
They're a great audience.

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:05.310
We've got a really
engaged audience

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:08.120
with really good retention.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:11.090
So getting your game in now, in
the early stages, as this

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:15.050
app is taking off, it's a really
great way to find those

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:16.560
dedicated gamers.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.570
There are not as many
games as we want

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:20.780
yet, using our services.

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:22.330
I mean, we've still got a
massive slew of them.

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:23.500
And it's been fantastic.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.520
Thank you, developers, for so
many of you integrating.

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:29.410
But not everyone has
done it yet.

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:32.170
So it's a really great
opportunity for some of the

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:35.850
indie devs to come on, integrate
our service, have a

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:40.540
great integration and be able to
get featured or have it go

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:42.300
through the system
like wildfire,

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.115
in these early stages.

00:14:43.115 --> 00:14:45.200
TODD KERPELMAN: OK.

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.910
Well you sort of answered
our second question.

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:50.990
But yeah, I'm a developer.

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:53.000
What do I get for--

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.420
why do I care about this app?

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:57.040
DUNCAN CURTIS: Well, this
comes for free.

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:00.570
So if you integrate our Play
Games services, you get shown

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:01.970
up here for free.

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:04.960
So people will be able
to search for

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.540
your game in the future.

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:09.060
We have, as you can see--

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:10.850
let me just go down.

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:13.740
Can we just switch back to
the demo for one second?

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:14.730
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:15.420
We're there.

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:19.520
DUNCAN CURTIS: So Popular is
actually a list of all our

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.720
most popular Play
enabled games.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:27.430
So this is similar to on the
Play store, where there are

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:29.860
the top Free or top Pay games.

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:31.750
These are the top Play
enabled games.

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:33.700
So if you're a developer,
you care.

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.240
Because if you integrate, you
can get straight on this list.

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.530
And I guarantee you.

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:39.200
We check this list
very regularly.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:39.950
TODD KERPELMAN: OK.

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:43.720
So if I click on one of these,
am I able to find out say,

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.170
Temple Run 2, which of my
friends are playing this?

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:47.000
DUNCAN CURTIS: Not yet.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.560
TODD KERPELMAN: Not yet.

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.870
There's that word again, yet.

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:52.940
All right.

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:55.500
And then I notice you also
have a list for Popular

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:56.100
Multiplayer.

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:56.660
DUNCAN CURTIS: Yes.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:58.460
So we have got a list of popular
multiplayer games.

00:15:58.460 --> 00:15:59.140
TODD KERPELMAN: I haven't
seen that before.

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:00.570
DUNCAN CURTIS: You haven't
seen it before?

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:02.000
TODD KERPELMAN: I
guess I should.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.670
DUNCAN CURTIS: You should
probably take a look at that.

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:04.970
TODD KERPELMAN: I should try
this app or something.

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:06.700
DUNCAN CURTIS: You should
really try this app.

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:10.410
So basically, we're rolling out
different ways for users

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:13.960
to find your game, by the way
they use our services.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.590
We have Popular Multiplayer
for now.

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:17.800
But you could only imagine that
we would want to do other

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:18.590
things in the future.

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:20.210
So we haven't got them yet.

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:20.940
TODD KERPELMAN: Gotcha.

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:27.020
Well, this might be a very
useful instance where I might

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:28.610
want to see which of my friends
are playing this

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:29.550
Popular Multiplayer game.

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:30.170
DUNCAN CURTIS: Exactly.

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:33.220
If you want to jump in and see
who's playing Super Stickman

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.570
Golf right now, you
can jump in.

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:40.560
And if I did have any friends
playing, in the future, it

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.450
would show up there
as an extra tab.

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:43.160
TODD KERPELMAN: That
would be awesome.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:47.050
I can't wait for that, which
you're launching next week.

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:47.630
Is that right?

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:48.750
DUNCAN CURTIS: Oh, clearly.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:50.360
Next week, that's the
one, just having

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.050
rolled out a release.

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:52.400
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:55.020
So that was sarcasm, for those
of you not in product

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:55.993
development.

00:16:55.993 --> 00:16:57.243
All right, cool.

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:03.970
So it seems like there are kind
of various avenues to

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:07.410
getting my game either
discovered or rediscovered.

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:09.650
What seems to be the
most popular?

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:11.605
Is it people look at the games
they recently played, and

00:17:11.605 --> 00:17:12.819
they're like, oh,
yeah, I remember

00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:14.050
playing that yesterday?

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:16.390
Is it the featured stuff?

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:18.460
Is it the, hey, here's what
my friends are playing?

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:20.020
DUNCAN CURTIS: Re-engagement
is really good.

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:22.020
So we find people
open the app.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.300
And they're like, oh, yeah.

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:25.750
They can see the games they've
been playing recently.

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:28.310
And if they're not feeling like
playing that one game

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:30.440
they've been playing the most
recently, it's a really great

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.840
way to reengage.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.790
As I said before, there
are Achievements.

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:36.200
If you've got 28 or 29
Achievements, a great reason

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:39.070
to jump back in and finish
that last one off.

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:40.660
It's also about discovery.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:42.400
Discovery has been really
good for us.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.270
And featuring is obviously
a really, really

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:46.215
great way to get that.

00:17:46.215 --> 00:17:49.720
TODD KERPELMAN: What are other
ways I can maximize my

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.590
discovery potential, be of
besides getting featured,

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:53.930
which is nice?

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:55.210
DUNCAN CURTIS: The
more services you

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:58.360
integrate, the better.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.100
So there are different ways
to get discovered

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:00.870
for different services.

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:03.890
So for example, the Multiplayer
is a unique

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:06.750
service this at the moment, that
has its own entire tab.

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:08.360
TODD KERPELMAN: OK.

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:13.520
And let's go into one of
these games again.

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.100
Is there anything you recommend,
in terms of

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:18.830
description, that maybe I
could do to improve the

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:19.270
experience?

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:21.210
Or is it kind at the same
guidelines as the Play store?

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:22.620
DUNCAN CURTIS: It's the same
guidelines as the Play store.

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.620
And we'll be improving this in
the future, to give you more

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:25.590
ways to do it.

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:27.910
But once again, I would say,
try to have really good

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:30.430
achievement art and
leaderboard art.

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:33.660
So you can see here that, while
the developer hasn't

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:39.310
chosen to specify icons, if we
jump back up to Triple Town,

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:45.730
which I went through Ellie to
find, we have individual icons

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:46.555
for each leaderboard.

00:18:46.555 --> 00:18:48.360
TODD KERPELMAN: I'd say, these
look more appealing.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:48.845
DUNCAN CURTIS: Yeah.

00:18:48.845 --> 00:18:49.730
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:53.740
So maybe that's good advice
to developers.

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:58.030
I suppose, if I'm a big
developer and I'm implementing

00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:01.680
my own leaderboard UI, I might
not think that adding

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:02.840
leaderboard icons
is important.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.710
Because I'm like,
I don't use it.

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:06.240
That's not how I'm doing
it in my game.

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.470
But it's still going
to show up here.

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:07.950
DUNCAN CURTIS: That's right.

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:11.540
So I'd advise, whatever
developer you are, go check

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:14.390
your game out in the
Play Games app, if

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:15.365
you've already launched.

00:19:15.365 --> 00:19:16.410
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:16.950
That sounds good.

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:18.880
Is there a way for me to preview
my game in the Play

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.050
Games app before
I've launched?

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:23.058
DUNCAN CURTIS: Not yet.

00:19:23.058 --> 00:19:25.520
TODD KERPELMAN: Not yet.

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.900
He keeps using that word.

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.830
Is it really just because you
don't want to say, no?

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:30.830
And you think that's--

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:32.940
DUNCAN CURTIS: I don't want
to say, no to you, Todd.

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:33.840
But they're all great
features.

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.330
I mean, these are definitely--

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:36.925
they're all great features.

00:19:36.925 --> 00:19:37.750
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:39.280
Well, that sounds good.

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:42.430
So developers, if you've
launched your game, check it

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:43.620
out in the Play Games app.

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:44.500
Make sure it looks good.

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:46.390
Make sure it looks like
something people would be

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:49.140
interested in playing.

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:51.830
And I guess let us know if
you have suggestions.

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:54.845
I think we might even have an
entry in the public bug

00:19:54.845 --> 00:19:57.480
database for the Play Games
destination app.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.660
So that any enhancements or
any requests or all those

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:02.900
things that I just mentioned,
go ahead and add them.

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:04.460
So we'll add some
peer pressure.

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:07.450
And see if we can get Duncan
and his team to

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:09.006
add some more stuff.

00:20:09.006 --> 00:20:09.670
DUNCAN CURTIS: Thanks.

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:10.540
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:16.120
Well, I think that wraps it up
for this biweekly episode of

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:20.550
"Game On." Thank you, Duncan,
for coming out and explaining

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:22.340
everything to us about
the Play Games app.

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:23.180
DUNCAN CURTIS: Thanks
for having me talk.

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.730
TODD KERPELMAN: You're going to
come back, when there's a

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:26.530
new, exciting announcement.

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:27.745
DUNCAN CURTIS: You'll see
me back regularly.

00:20:27.745 --> 00:20:28.960
TODD KERPELMAN: All
right, excellent.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.100
I can't wait.

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:32.170
Thank you very much,
YouTube audience.

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:33.900
And we will see you in
a couple of weeks.
