00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.640
Yes, I could talk about neural
networks as metaphors for the brain.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.210
It's nice and it might even be true,
but it comes with a lot of baggage and

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.420
it can sometimes lead you astray.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.200
So I'm not going to talk about
it at all in this course.

00:00:14.305 --> 00:00:16.114
No need to be a wizard neural scientist.

00:00:16.114 --> 00:00:20.405
Neural networks naturally make sense
if you're simply a lazy engineer

00:00:20.405 --> 00:00:23.355
with a big GPU who just wants
machine learning to work better.

00:00:24.395 --> 00:00:26.275
Now, though,
is a good time to talk about the math.
