00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.460
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.923
Bipedal, naked, large brained,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.875
long the master of fire,
tools, and language,

00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:24.023
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.903
Aware that death is inevitable.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.863
Yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.683
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.243
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.450
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.220
We shape the future from

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.693
our shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.160
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.463
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.950
An exploration made
possible by the generosity

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.737
of humans like you.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.350
- The thing about humans...

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.900
If you haven't thought
about it, I'm sure you will.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.370
We can and do eat anything.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.540
So, what we can do is eat directly.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.360
So, we can be completely carnivorous.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.710
We could be almost completely herbivorous.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.830
If we can't eat it, like grass,

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.350
we feed it to a cow who can eat it

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.310
or we do what Pascal does,

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.830
which is takes the yeast
and makes bread out of it.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.060
So, we can also take that cow and cook it

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.740
so we can actually get
something out of it.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.940
I just picked this slide at random.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.910
This is not one that I think
depicts much of anything.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.810
But the only reason I'm showing it

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.070
is because I want you
to get sort of an idea

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.020
of what the body size of what

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.790
we're going to be talking about.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.280
None of these animals are small.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.590
Okay, so, what did they eat?

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.010
Well, how do you know?

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.970
So, one of the ways is to do
morphological comparisons.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.410
So, what you have here is the skull

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.730
of a very robust
Australopithecine on your right

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.400
and you've got a very early
archaic hominin on your left.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.290
You can see that there's
a massive difference.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.890
This is a chewing muscle
that goes through here.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.790
It has a ridge on the top of its head

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.930
where there's musculature
that goes all the way up.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.270
It is a chewing machine.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.450
These are the teeth.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.290
So, you see the size of these teeth

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.630
versus the size of another fossil,

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.450
Australopithecus africanus,
compared to a modern human.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.250
So, you can see the
different sizes of teeth.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.970
There are people in this room who do that.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:20.803
I don't.

00:03:20.803 --> 00:03:22.760
But I can do it in general.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.920
Okay, what did they eat?

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.410
You can also look at force and strength.

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:28.330
You can look at...

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.390
Use a model.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.840
So, what you got here is a macaque monkey.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.530
This is done on a macaque monkey skull.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.140
This is not done on a live macaque.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.570
I don't believe.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.180
Although, those were
implanted in macaques.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.160
This is an Australopithecine
or a cast thereof

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.500
shaped exactly like you would
a live one, if you could.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.040
And you can see where the
stress and the strain is coming.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.000
So, what you've got is a
lot of stress across here,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.620
which is where the chewing musculature's

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.250
gonna go back behind here.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.210
And so, you can see that
the distribution of stress

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.130
in some places is the same.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.940
In other places, it's not.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.170
Because what we're looking at

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.643
is strain deformation of
the bone following stress.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.030
Another way of looking at it is microwear.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.360
That's what these pictures are.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.230
This is work that was down by
Mark Teaford and Peter Ungar.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.340
And what they say is
"gorilla fine wear striae,

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.920
baboon-like pits, microflakes,

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.430
and it shifts to hominid
puncture-crushing."

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.830
That tells you a little bit about

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.380
what kinds of textures
these animals were eating,

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.900
but it doesn't tell you what they ate.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.850
Well, I like to go to
general principles first.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.790
So, although I'm not
gonna give you models,

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.920
I'll give you some general principles.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.820
One of those is, as body size increases,

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.260
metabolic rate decreases.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.650
Per kilo, that's not overall energetics.

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.880
So, for small animals, they have to eat

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.510
small packages of high quality food

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.140
that could be processed quickly.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.350
So, you think of that galago monkey.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.330
Galago prosimian.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:02.950
You look at a large animal.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.810
Lots of low quality food
processed more slowly

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.720
and they tend to be more sedentary.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.340
And, again, it's not
total output of energy

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.053
or total input of energy, it is per kilo.

00:05:14.917 --> 00:05:17.050
Well, okay, so, from that,

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.700
let's look at what primate
foods are all about.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.590
Primate foods break down into
sort of three categories.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.853
Insects, leaves, and fruit.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.260
So, what you're looking at
are things that are insects.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.707
They move around a lot, but
they're high in protein.

00:05:31.707 --> 00:05:33.610
Leaves are also high in protein,

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.910
but very difficult to digest.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.410
And they also are seasonal.

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.830
So, they will disappear.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.940
And so, they actually move, but over time.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.660
Fruit is high in energy.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.620
I almost showed you orangutan fruits

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.720
that do not look like
they're high in energy.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.780
But most fruits are high in energy

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.450
and they're easy to digest.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.010
They are, however, like
leaves, mobile in time.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.280
They come seasonally.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.460
When you look at the
primates that feed here,

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.590
you have small primates,
very small primates,

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.190
that can feed on insects.

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.950
Again, requires small packages of food,

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.350
but highly easy to digest.

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:12.791
You have large primates,
depicted by this gorilla,

00:06:12.791 --> 00:06:16.440
again high in protein,
but very hard to digest.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.290
And gorillas don't move around

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.980
as much as the Microcebus does.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:21.950
I show you fruit.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.670
Although there's no animal
that can survive just on fruit,

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:26.520
because you don't get the protein content.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.430
But I show you some monkeys that

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.340
are gonna be feeding on fruit.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.480
You look at what these animals do do

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.150
is you get animals along the
lines of frugivore/folivores.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.660
So, the large animals will be leaves

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.810
and then they combine that with fruit.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.360
Small animals will either
be totally insectivorous

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.570
or they'll combine that with fruit.

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.870
What you never have is a primate that

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.030
relies on leaves and insects.

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.120
And that's just because a large animal

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.090
cannot capture enough insects

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.470
in order to be able to survive itself.

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:00.130
Or able to survive.

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:01.061
So, we look at this.

00:07:01.061 --> 00:07:04.834
In our body size, we should
have been a frugivore/folivore.

00:07:04.834 --> 00:07:07.460
Okay, well, you know what your diet is.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.360
And I would say that this has
been going on for a long time.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.310
We were not folivores.

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:14.180
Not for a very long time.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:18.650
So, what do we do now
about what do they eat?

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:22.340
Alright, this is the part that
I will be presenting today.

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.010
And the data that I will present.

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:26.890
And this has to do with stable isotopes.

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:29.910
Stable isotopes are different forms

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:31.330
of the exact same element.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.870
And the one I'm going to
be talking about is carbon,

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.400
because it's going to
be in a mineral portion

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.930
of enamel or in bone.

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:42.190
And you don't get any
kinds of organics in that.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:43.510
So, what these elements...

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:45.350
How they differ are different masses,

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:48.960
which means that they
react at different rates.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.788
And that means that, if you've got

00:07:50.788 --> 00:07:53.440
something that reacts at different rates,

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.580
that it can be distributed differently

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.720
at certain trophic levels

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.290
across different parts of
the same trophic level.

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:02.610
And that's what we're gonna be doing.

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:05.880
We present that as C13, C12.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.530
Those are the two stable isotopes.

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:10.340
You've probably heard of carbon
14, which is radiocarbon.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:14.070
This is not a radioactive element.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:15.940
And so, isotope.

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.710
Then you get them presented as delta C13.

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:19.820
And it's in per mil.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:20.830
Just to make it...

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:22.100
Where you take a standard.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.640
You take your sample.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.980
You compare them and the
difference is the delta.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.060
Okay, how did this all get started?

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:33.080
Well, we know that atmospheric
CO2 is taken up by plants

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.190
by photosynthetic pathway.

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:40.190
In 1948, we knew that
there were plants that

00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:43.360
the way in which they took up CO2...

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.939
And I have to say that there is a man who

00:08:44.939 --> 00:08:48.870
was at UCSD when I got
here who was one of the men

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:50.508
who discovered this.

00:08:50.508 --> 00:08:52.670
C4 plants, I'm not even
gonna talk about them,

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:55.810
because that wasn't on the UCSD.

00:08:55.810 --> 00:09:00.500
But they weren't even
identified until 1967.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.280
So, we've had almost 20 years where

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:05.860
people thought everything was like this.

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:10.700
Now, what we do now is
look at the geochemistry.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:15.590
Well, Samuel Epstein, who was at CalTech,

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:19.580
in 1971, finally had his aha moment

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:22.190
when he realized that
all those plants that

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:25.280
he had been collecting across
country and everywhere else

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.900
and he could make no sense of it,

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.720
because they came out with
a bimodal distribution.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.130
Lo and behold, these were

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:33.550
two different photosynthetic pathways.

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:35.630
Those two photosynthetic pathways

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.820
are actually different kinds of plants.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:41.050
So, what you get here are
what we call C4 plants.

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:43.110
They're gonna be arid season grasses.

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:45.340
Some sedges, not very many of them.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.700
And many of the succulents
have the same numbers,

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:49.830
even though they're not C4.

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:52.884
They come out to be about a minus 12

00:09:52.884 --> 00:09:57.550
compared to atmospheric
CO2, which is minus seven.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:00.250
And it's different than
it was in the past.

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:02.610
So, we have to correct for that.

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:06.150
C3 plants actually take up
their material differently.

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:10.270
They fix in a three carbon sugar at first.

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:11.980
They come out to be minus 26.

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:15.600
There is no overlap between C3 and C4.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.200
These are primate foods.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:22.200
These are leaves, fruits,
seeds, herbaceous plants,

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:23.820
all those kinds of things.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.220
Those are primate foods.

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.500
These are not primate foods.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:31.290
Alright, so, but we're not
interested in the plants.

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:32.980
We're interested in the animals.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:35.220
We're gonna try to figure
out what the animals do.

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:36.760
The first lab study was by

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.450
one of Sam Epstein's
postdocs, Michael DeNiro,

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:41.460
that was actually my postdoc advisor.

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:45.210
And so, at CalTech, what
they did is they took grasses

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:48.150
and they took plants that had a C3 pathway

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:50.670
and they fed it to lab rats.

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:52.300
And what they discovered was that

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:55.800
these two actually mimicked
the plants that they ate.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.950
So, they actually could
see the difference.

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:01.667
The one issue was,

00:11:01.667 --> 00:11:04.370
"Okay, but we don't
know what the plants are

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:05.630
when we're looking at these things

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:09.570
from the Pliocene, the Miocene,
and even the Pleistocene."

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:11.320
Well, okay, you're gonna get a number,

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.770
but what does that tell
you about what the plant is

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:14.660
or what's going on?

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.250
You know, at this end, that's C4.

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:17.776
You know, at this end, it's C3.

00:11:17.776 --> 00:11:19.650
What do you know about this?

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:22.410
How is it offset from the diet?

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:24.130
And what we found in this study

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:26.840
is that the offset is about 10 per mil.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.370
These are animals with simple guts,

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:30.610
just like you and I have.

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:32.750
So, there was another lab study

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:36.030
that was done on llama, of all things.

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:39.840
And it was done, I believe,
at the University of Utah.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.010
And what they did is
they looked at the offset

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:45.980
between these large
animals and their diets.

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:49.450
Lo and behold, they are quite
different from one another.

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:51.240
So, that means, if you're gonna use

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.320
what you thought was the
offset, which is minus 10,

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.690
you're gonna have problems
with an animal like a llama,

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:00.490
a big animal, because
it's not gonna give you

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:02.923
the same kind of
information about the diet.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.390
This is the reason why.

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:08.822
This is for one of the
people in the audience.

00:12:08.822 --> 00:12:12.140
What we have are cows,
which are unguinous,

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:14.131
and they also are ruminants.

00:12:14.131 --> 00:12:16.600
They have a very basic stomach

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.260
in the forefront of their other parts

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.890
of their digestive system.

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:22.360
And what they do is they house

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.630
huge, vast quantities of microorganisms.

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:30.305
And what they can do then
is they can actually ferment

00:12:30.305 --> 00:12:33.410
indigestible material.

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:34.270
They are...

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:36.260
Cows are nonselective feeders.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:37.810
If you look at the skull of a cow,

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:39.660
it does not have any top teeth.

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:41.750
All it's doing is ripping anything up

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:43.810
out of the ground and taking it.

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:47.220
And so, all the bovids in East Africa

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:48.940
are this kind of animal.

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:52.397
The ones we're gonna
compare to our hominins.

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:58.000
Horses, on the other
hand, for those of you...

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.610
If you live here, you know
exactly what a horse look like.

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:03.910
So, I didn't know that much
about horse digestive system

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:06.620
until I was looking at
this to teach my courses.

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.670
They also have a pretty
massive digestive system,

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:11.280
but it's all hindgut.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.500
It is not in the stomach.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:13.820
It's in the hindgut.

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:16.780
So, they actually are far
more selective feeders,

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.210
because any toxin that comes in,

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:24.210
which gets taken care of by
the ruminant's microorganisms,

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:27.610
cannot be handled by a horse.

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:28.730
That's why horses have

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:31.890
such more sensitive diet requirements.

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:33.260
If you look at a horse skull,

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.630
it has both upper teeth and lower teeth

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:39.240
that allows it to pick out
exactly what it wants to eat.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.340
These are primates.

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:44.860
Those don't look really anything
like either one of these.

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:48.720
So, why do we think that we
can compare our primates,

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:53.000
our hominins, directly
to browsers and grazers?

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.483
Either zebra or to bovids in East Africa.

00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:59.890
If you look at all living primates...

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:01.093
You've got a prosimian here.

00:14:01.093 --> 00:14:02.430
You've got monkeys.

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:03.480
You've got an ape.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.023
They are all C3.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.420
If you look at Old World monkeys,

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:11.890
whether you get a
ceropithecine, a colobine,

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:16.040
what the baboons do, what
a duoc langur does in Asia,

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.240
they are all C3.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.633
Does not matter whether they
have a large stomach or not.

00:14:23.987 --> 00:14:27.540
Baboons, in very marginal areas...

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:31.960
I went through every study that
was done on living primates.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.910
And what you will hear is
that baboons can eat grass.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:36.180
Yes, they can.

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:40.090
And about 5-10% of their
diet can actually be grass.

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:43.220
And it's only done in one marginal area

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.490
out of five in Africa.

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:49.290
You also get some poop that is C4,

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:51.380
but, when you look at
their hair or their teeth,

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:52.563
they are C3.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.220
So, now, let's go to the fossil record.

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:58.370
This is from Bernard Wood

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:01.920
and I really appreciate him
allowing me to show this.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:05.253
What you have here are possible hominins.

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:10.800
You've got what would be
called archaic hominins.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.270
And here you have the megadont.

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:15.450
The ones that I showed you before.

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:19.270
Then you get premodern Homo
and anatomically modern human.

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:21.440
I will not be going up into this.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.940
I wanted to and I didn't think

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:26.660
there was gonna be enough time to do it.

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:28.590
So, let's look a little bit

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:31.350
at the skeletons of some of these.

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:33.699
I just picked some at random.

00:15:33.699 --> 00:15:38.320
Julia Lee-Thorp in South Africa
got us started doing this

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.800
and has done a phenomenal job

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.890
of preparing how you do enamel

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:45.320
to do carbon isotope analysis.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.300
What I hope you see here is that

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:51.170
all of these have flared rib cages.

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:56.170
And Leslie Aiello once
said Lucy had no waist.

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:59.730
If you think about it,
even men have waists.

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:01.980
Because we have a small digestive system.

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:02.813
We stand out.

00:16:02.813 --> 00:16:04.380
We have a small digestive system.

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:06.300
These others did not.

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.610
But they're all hind gut fermenters.

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:13.150
Because that's what all of
us are and our relatives are.

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:16.590
This is Homo ergaster, a
very early Homo erectus.

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:18.420
And what I think you'll see is that

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:20.970
it does not look exactly like us.

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:22.720
He probably had a waist.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:23.553
So, what we're looking at

00:16:23.553 --> 00:16:27.063
is a different size digestive system.

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:33.070
So, in 1999, Matt Sponheimer
and Julia Lee-Thorp

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.290
published what I believe
is probably the first paper

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:37.870
looking at carbon isotopes

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:41.370
in early hominins to figure out diet.

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:45.250
They came up with an average
of minus 8.2 per mil.

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:48.520
Quote, "this early hominid
ate large quantities

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.650
of carbon-13 enriched foods."

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:52.470
And, from their perspective,

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:56.320
the thing that made them
on the human lineage

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.513
is that we were eating C4 foods.

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:01.760
Alright, what they did...

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:04.290
And I hope you can see this in this slide.

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:08.270
Is that they took the endpoint of C4 foods

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:10.650
and they took the endpoint of C3 foods...

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:13.660
And I'll remind you this
is a foregut fermenter.

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:15.340
This is a hindgut fermenter.

00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:16.660
It is not a simple gut.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.920
Any of them.

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:23.920
So, what we have here is a
zebra and we have a gerenuk.

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:26.120
But I could have picked
a bunch of other ones.

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:29.190
Well, I don't think you can
compare a primate to that,

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:30.400
but that's what they did.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.080
And then you take Homo...

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:36.000
This was Australopithecus
africanis, I believe, at eight.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.680
And then they said, "Okay, well,

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.210
it's about halfway along the line.

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:41.797
Massive quantities of C4 foods."

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:47.710
There is another way of doing this.

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:49.940
And this is what I started looking at.

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:53.550
And that is what if you think
about an offset of 10 per mil,

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:57.530
which is what simple
gutted animals have now.

00:17:57.530 --> 00:17:59.550
We do, roughly.

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:00.810
Or 14 per mil.

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:03.720
What would be the difference in the diet?

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.917
And what you have are the blue ones.

00:18:05.917 --> 00:18:08.740
The difference is if
you look at 10 per mil.

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:12.070
And the green ones are the
ones if you look at 14 per mil.

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:14.300
And I'm not saying that either
one of these is correct.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:16.070
It's somewhere probably in between.

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:19.470
And probably varies across
these different species.

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:22.020
What I think you'll notice is that

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:26.640
virtually all of these have
low quantities of C4 foods

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.170
if you buy my argument.

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:31.410
Or they are actually C3 feeders,

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:33.720
just like any normal primate would be.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.130
With one exception.

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:38.790
And that is the very
robust ones in East Africa

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:42.014
with the huge, massive chewing muscles.

00:18:42.014 --> 00:18:45.630
Now, this cannot be cited,

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:48.640
but Fred Grind gave me
permission to point out that

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:52.590
there is a new Paranthropus
at 3.5 million,

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:54.810
which would put it way down in here.

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:57.100
And it is a C3 feeder.

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:58.900
If you look at it, it's either

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:03.200
a mix with very little C4 or it is C3.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:08.200
So, sometime, around one
million to 1.8 million,

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:12.780
we ended up with a major shift
that those animals became C4.

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:14.653
It was not true before that.

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:17.245
So, I'll finish up right now

00:19:17.245 --> 00:19:20.810
when we get to Homo
ergaster or Homo erectus.

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:25.060
The same exact number as you
saw in the Australopithecine.

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:27.300
But, here, I do not think we're looking

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:30.730
at mostly green plants.

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:32.730
I think, here, we're looking at meat.

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:34.230
And we're pretty sure.

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:37.010
And I think we're gonna
have some speakers after me.

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:40.060
They're gonna point out how
far back this probably went.

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:42.010
This is one of Leslie Aiello's.

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:44.310
Again, human-like body shape.

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:47.483
Probably the simple gut the way we do.

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:51.280
I would say that probably
what we're looking at

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:55.390
when we have mixed C3
and C4 is probably a mix

00:19:55.390 --> 00:20:00.390
of hunting zebra and hunting
C3 feeding browsing animals.

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:04.150
So, my conclusions.

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:08.720
If we consider variation
in diet to appetite,

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.600
which most people don't,

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:14.420
in modern fauna, the
diets in early hominins

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:18.740
appear far more varied than
originally appreciated.

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:21.200
If we consider metabolic differences

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.020
between animals with simple GI tracts,

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.470
which most primate, all primates have,

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:29.826
and those relying on
extensive fermentation,

00:20:29.826 --> 00:20:33.930
alternative diets become
distinct possibilities.

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:35.493
Now, thank you.

00:20:35.493 --> 00:20:36.653
Oh wait.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:38.923
One last one.

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:43.110
I just want to say I have
to thank my students,

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:45.580
because, if it weren't for my
present and former students,

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.862
you would not have heard this talk today.

00:20:47.862 --> 00:20:50.270
(applause)

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:51.803
- The world loves meat.

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:55.050
Each one of us in the US eats

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:58.570
about 200 pounds of meat per year.

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:01.190
Which makes us one of the top

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:03.310
meat consuming countries in the world.

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:06.580
And it's more than twice
the global average.

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:09.210
So, we are a nation of meat eaters

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:11.780
living in a world of meat eaters.

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:14.103
And global meat
consumption is on the rise.

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:17.600
But the question is are we, as a species,

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:20.573
inherently vegetarian or carnivorous?

00:21:20.573 --> 00:21:23.363
The answer is that we are both.

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:27.090
Our species evolved to
consume an omnivorous diet

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:30.610
that contains both plant
and animal products.

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:34.050
But, today, I'll be giving
you a very brief history

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:36.073
of our species's relationship with meat.

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:39.710
And I have been tasked with the job

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:40.930
to outline the nutritional

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:43.443
benefits and costs of eating meat.

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:45.653
Man the Hunter.

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.670
The statement is a
catchphrase of our species.

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:52.570
It conjures bold images
that have dominated

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:55.010
academic discourse, the media,

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:57.570
and public opinion for decades.

00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:00.780
Here, a popular artist named
Banksy plays with this idea

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:02.583
in his piece The Trolley Hunters.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.390
And I urge you to do a search

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:07.290
for Man the Hunter on the Internet

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:10.290
and view the type of images that pop up.

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:12.890
There are tens of millions of images.

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:15.450
And most of them are a
variation on a theme,

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:16.563
as you might imagine.

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:20.030
The individual images and their content

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:21.830
are not what's important.

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:24.750
It's the underlying take home message.

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:27.883
And that message is
that meat made us human.

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:30.660
For well over a century,

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:33.360
anthropologists have
touted meat consumption

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.100
as the catalyst for
critical watershed moments

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:37.780
in our evolutionary past.

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:41.720
Things like pair bonding,
family formation,

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:46.613
neural expansion, tool
making, and even cooperation.

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:51.500
While the specific role
that meat might have played

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:54.180
in the evolution of human
behavior is debated,

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:56.160
one thing is certain.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.430
Meat did change the playing field

00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:00.143
for our earliest ancestors.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.810
So, our history with meat goes back

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:06.230
quite far in our evolutionary past.

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:09.760
And how far back continues to be debated.

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.350
The image you see here dates

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:13.940
to approximately 20,000 years ago.

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:17.310
This artwork is found on the
caves in Lascaux, France.

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:18.526
And, by the time that the artists

00:23:18.526 --> 00:23:20.880
were painting these images,

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:25.330
it's possible and likely that
early members of our genus

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:28.013
had already been eating
meat for millions of years.

00:23:29.564 --> 00:23:32.130
Hunters living in the Paleolithic

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:34.570
did not eat only muscle tissue.

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:37.230
Much like contemporary foragers today,

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:39.900
they consumed all of the animal.

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:42.090
All edible portions of the carcass.

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:45.580
Which would have included
organs, bone marrow,

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:48.730
and even, in some instances,
the GI tract of the animal.

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:50.753
Which is a practice called gastrophagy.

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:53.620
They would have targeted game animals

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:55.720
initially using stone tools

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.200
with some early, though
controversial, dates

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:00.210
putting the first stone tools in Kenya

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:01.973
at 3.3 million years ago.

00:24:03.032 --> 00:24:06.492
Hafted or stone-tipped spears
came on the scene later

00:24:06.492 --> 00:24:09.140
with some finds in the
archeological record

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:13.120
dating to around 500,000
years ago in South Africa.

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.260
Bow and arrow technology later still.

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.633
Possibly around 70,000 years ago.

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.680
The important point here is that

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:22.550
different complex technologies

00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:27.550
were created, modified, and
used to target animal protein

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:31.113
going very far back in
human evolutionary history.

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:38.060
So, the question of when
is a bit tricky to pin down

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:40.920
and is something we'll
be talking about today.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.510
The question of why our
ancestors turned to meat

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:46.320
is slightly less contested.

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:49.300
This is a photo of women in the
population with whom I work.

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:52.550
The Hadza foragers of Tanzania
who live in East Africa.

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:55.550
And very rarely do we see or associate

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:57.753
women with big game hunting.

00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:00.460
And so, I like to show this photo,

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:03.500
because it highlights the
often very cooperative form

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:06.390
that hunting in human
populations can take.

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:09.140
And, on this day, a man
killed a cape buffalo

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:11.140
and there was so much meat that

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:14.600
all hands were needed on
deck to transport this meat

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:17.220
from the butchery site back to the camp.

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:19.180
And I was also conscripted to help.

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:20.330
I am not on camera.

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:22.280
I'm taking the photo.

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:23.410
And I'm useless.

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:24.810
And I was useless that day, as well.

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:28.460
So, my portion had to be
carried in a backpack.

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:30.070
It was humiliating.

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:31.570
But it was helpful.

00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:34.030
And, as I'm not very efficient

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:35.300
to carrying anything on my head.

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:36.630
So, the backpack worked for the day.

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:38.830
But, when I said all hands on deck,

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:41.185
I meant all hands on deck.

00:25:41.185 --> 00:25:45.313
So, this begs the question
why all the effort?

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:48.900
Meat is a concentrated nutrient source

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.630
that is easy to digest.

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:52.120
Depending on preparation.

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:54.540
Which we will talk
about later today, also.

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:58.840
It's high in protein, niacin,
essential micronutrients,

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:02.900
like B complex vitamins, iron, and fat.

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:04.650
It has three major types of fats,

00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:08.760
trans-fatty acids,
cholesterol, and triglycerides

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:12.060
that are comprised mostly
of saturated fatty acids,

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:13.960
monounsaturated fatty acids,

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:17.483
and polyunsaturated fatty acids,
which we often call PUFAs.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.500
Two essential fatty acids found in meat

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:24.450
are linoleic acid, which is an omega six,

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:27.820
and alpha-linoleic acid,
which is an omega three.

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:30.390
These cannot be synthesized by humans.

00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:32.020
And so, we need them.

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:34.150
They're important for
brain growth and function.

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:36.183
So, we must consume them in our diet.

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:39.070
Additional important omega three PUFAs

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:40.160
that are found in red meat

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:42.453
include docosahexaenoic acid or DHA

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:46.240
and eicosapentaenoic acid or EPA.

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:48.340
These are essential during
pregnancy and lactation

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:50.830
and have also been
shown to reduce the risk

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:52.463
of some chronic diseases.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.290
Red meat also plays a role

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:58.510
in preventing iron deficiency or anemia.

00:26:58.510 --> 00:26:59.343
And, around the world,

00:26:59.343 --> 00:27:03.220
iron is one of the most
common deficient nutrients.

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:04.940
And this might be linked to the fact that

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:07.252
it has low bioavailability.

00:27:07.252 --> 00:27:10.540
Which can be defined as the ease and speed

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:12.770
at which a nutrient, like iron,

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:15.260
makes its way from the food that we eat

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:17.270
to the target tissue.

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:19.645
There are two different
types of dietary iron.

00:27:19.645 --> 00:27:22.540
As you might have
interpreted from this slide,

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:25.040
heme and non-heme iron.

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:26.670
Non-heme iron is found

00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:28.890
in both plant foods and animal tissues.

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:31.550
And this type of iron is poorly absorbed

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:33.433
and has low bioavailability.

00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:36.340
Heme iron, on the other hand,

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:39.560
comes from hemoglobin and
myoglobin that's found in animals.

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:43.430
And this type of iron
is very bioavailable.

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:45.580
For example, while it only contributes

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:49.530
to a modest 10-15% of total dietary intake

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:51.400
in the diet of red meat eaters,

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:55.063
it accounts for more than
40% of total absorbed iron.

00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:59.780
So, heme iron is also known to increase

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:01.620
the absorption of non-heme iron.

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:04.930
Which means that meat really
is the best source of iron

00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:07.210
that we can consume.

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:09.750
It's important, as delays in global

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:11.140
brain function and motor function

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:13.833
have been associated with
chronic iron deficiency.

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.800
Heme is also involved in the distinction

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:20.200
between red and white meat.

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:23.083
Which is largely based
on the myoglobin content.

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.160
Myoglobin is the heme iron that

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:28.060
contains pigmented proteins

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:30.090
which make the meat red in color.

00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:32.893
So, the more myoglobin,
the redder the meat.

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:36.660
Beef has far more myoglobin
when compared to chicken,

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:38.540
which is considered a white meat.

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:40.773
And, if you were used to
classifying pork as a white meat,

00:28:40.773 --> 00:28:42.981
you're probably likely to do so

00:28:42.981 --> 00:28:45.660
based on a very successful
advertising campaign

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:47.630
from the late 1980s.

00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:49.860
The slogan "Pork, the other white meat"

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:52.510
was created for the National Pork Board

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:57.060
in order to boost sales to
compete with chicken and turkey.

00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:59.410
And the campaign was very effective.

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:01.760
So, although pork is typically classified

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:04.340
as a white meat in culinary context,

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:06.200
it is most certainly a red meat

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:09.100
when it comes to its
nutritional composition.

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:10.395
And this is important.

00:29:10.395 --> 00:29:13.040
Because red meat has
certain characteristics

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:14.510
that white meat does not.

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:15.830
And these are often associated

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:17.403
with negative health outcomes.

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:20.430
Associations reported with

00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:23.510
colorectal cancer and other carcinomas,

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:25.950
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease,

00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:27.810
type II diabetes, and, potentially,

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:30.183
other inflammatory processes, as well.

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:35.320
There are many proposed explanations

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:37.193
for these disease associations.

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:41.940
Such as saturated fat, high salt intake,

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:43.170
and environmental pollutants

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:44.920
that may be contaminating red meat.

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:47.600
Another mechanistic explanation

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.500
is the metabolic incorporation

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:53.260
of a nonhuman sialic acid called Neu5Gc.

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:54.810
And much of this groundbreaking work

00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:57.370
is being down right here at
UCSD at the medical school

00:29:57.370 --> 00:29:58.583
in Ajit Varki's lab.

00:29:59.778 --> 00:30:02.490
Sialic acids are a
family of monosaccharides

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:04.770
that are widely distributed
in animal tissues

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:07.133
and, to a lesser extent, other organisms.

00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:11.940
And they're located at the
very distal end of sugar chains

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:15.380
that are connected to the
surfaces of cells and proteins.

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:18.300
We lost the enzyme synthesizing Neu5Gc

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:20.170
in our evolutionary past.

00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:22.780
Yet trace amounts are
still found in humans.

00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:26.200
So, even though it's a foreign
molecule to the human body,

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.870
we incorporate small amounts

00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:29.573
from the red meat that we consume.

00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:34.820
Red meat contains very
high amounts of Neu5Gc.

00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:36.870
I did a postdoc in Ajit's lab

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:40.130
and played a very small
role in very large project

00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:42.770
that attempted to quantify
the amount of Neu5Gc

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:45.886
in commonly consumed
foods in the human diet.

00:30:45.886 --> 00:30:49.670
And Neu5Gc is in all animal products.

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:51.500
So, anything associated with red meat,

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:54.130
which would include
dairy products, as well.

00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:57.200
Eating red meat or the
products of red meat

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:59.160
allows for the metabolic incorporation

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:02.160
of this Neu5Gc into human tissues.

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:05.480
So, the immune system recognizes
it as a foreign threat

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:08.566
and then produces
antibodies to counter it.

00:31:08.566 --> 00:31:11.200
So, repeated consumption of red meat

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.100
can cause chronic inflammation,

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:16.740
which has been known to increase
risks of tumor formation.

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:18.900
Neu5Gc has been linked to cancer,

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:22.430
as well as cardiovascular and
other inflammatory diseases.

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:24.590
And all available evidence supports this.

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:25.950
Including studies that have been done

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:28.203
with mice with humanized sialic acids.

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:32.740
So, despite these disease risks,

00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:36.130
red meat consumption around
the world is on the rise.

00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:38.870
As much of the world is protein deficient,

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:40.940
red meat is a good source of protein.

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:42.960
And not only protein, but also iron,

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.609
which we've talked about.

00:31:44.609 --> 00:31:46.850
So, perhaps the solution, then,

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:50.440
according to many nutritionists,
is just to eat less meat.

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:52.350
The American Institute for Cancer Research

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:53.830
recommends that we don't eat more than

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:56.723
about 18 ounces of red meat per week.

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:01.750
If the world does continue its
upward trajectory, however,

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:04.214
how will we feed an
expected global population

00:32:04.214 --> 00:32:07.213
of 9.7 billion by 2050?

00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:11.290
According to the Food and
Agriculture Organization

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:12.440
of the United Nations,

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:16.000
about 60% of the world's
ice free land surface

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.270
is currently dedicated to raising crops

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:21.650
and providing grazing land
for the animals we eat.

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:24.830
So, this is supporting
around 360 million cattle

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:27.333
and 600 million sheep and goats.

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:31.350
About 788 million acres are used

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:33.800
almost exclusively for livestock.

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:36.690
A recent census of agriculture by the USDA

00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:38.700
estimates that this totals up to about

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:42.740
40% of all of the tillable land in the US.

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:44.390
And many food scientists argue that

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:47.123
this level of production is unsustainable.

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:50.520
So, sustainable alternative
feeds for cattle

00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:52.110
are now being introduced.

00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:55.591
Like microalgae, sugarcane,
or brewer's grains,

00:32:55.591 --> 00:32:57.540
which are the solid residue that

00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:00.430
are the product of germinated
and dried cereal grains

00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:01.873
used to make beer.

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:04.970
Diets are also switching to alfalfa,

00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:07.313
which reduces methane emissions in cattle.

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.380
So, in addition to coming up with

00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:11.460
more sustainable feed for livestock,

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:12.880
people are trying to come up with ways

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:16.590
to make the entire food
system more sustainable.

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:18.200
And some estimates suggest that,

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:22.200
in order to produce one billion
kilograms of beef today,

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:27.080
we're only using about 88% of
the water that we did in 1970.

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:30.913
And only about approximately
67% of the land.

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:34.130
In addition to coming up with this

00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:35.860
more sustainable feed for livestock,

00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:38.220
people are trying to come with ways

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:40.950
to just make the entire
system more efficient.

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:45.270
And this effort extends to
reducing waste outputs, as well.

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:47.145
So, the amount of manure, for example,

00:33:47.145 --> 00:33:51.322
has been reduced by 18% compared to 1977.

00:33:51.322 --> 00:33:54.130
And, in addition, the
overall carbon footprint

00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:57.830
per billion kilos of beef produced in 2017

00:33:57.830 --> 00:34:00.110
was reduced by over 16% compared to

00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:02.513
the same footprint from the late 1970s.

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.256
But, while they might be down,

00:34:05.256 --> 00:34:09.170
livestock still contribute
to greenhouse gas emissions.

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:11.140
As of last year, in 2017,

00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:13.410
the FAO estimated that, globally,

00:34:13.410 --> 00:34:16.213
livestock contributes to about 14.5%

00:34:16.213 --> 00:34:20.690
of all anthropogenic or manmade
greenhouse gas emissions

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:23.093
due to enteric fermentation and manure.

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:25.920
Some estimates suggest that emissions

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.520
may be similar to those produced

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:29.410
by the transportation industry.

00:34:29.410 --> 00:34:32.370
Although this figure
is very controversial.

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:34.520
Suggesting that cows might emit

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:36.943
as much gas on Earth as vehicles.

00:34:36.943 --> 00:34:39.520
So, some in the agricultural industry

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:42.360
caution that these are not
easy comparisons to make

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:44.940
and other factors are, of course, at play.

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:46.790
But one thing that conservationists

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:48.870
and agricultural industry agree on

00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:50.730
is that livestock does contribute

00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:52.110
to a substantial percentage

00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:53.913
of greenhouse gases in the world.

00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:57.500
The agricultural industry
is making strides, however,

00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:00.130
to reduce gas output by introducing feeds

00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:02.760
that create less belching in cows,

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:05.110
improving breeding in a way that

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:08.030
animal health interventions
are done differently.

00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:09.490
And the FAO argues that,

00:35:09.490 --> 00:35:12.910
if herd sizes were to shrink,
based on these best practices,

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:16.400
that would mean fewer, yet
more productive livestock.

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.595
So, in addition to
belching and passing gas,

00:35:18.595 --> 00:35:21.240
cows also produce a lot of manure.

00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:23.090
It's the endpoint of their digestion.

00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:26.030
And it also produces nitrous oxide.

00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:28.360
So, there are many
fascinating new practices

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:31.670
being developed that are
turning manure into electricity.

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:34.773
Electricity which is then
being sold back to the grid.

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:39.313
So, the costs of meat production are high.

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:42.250
And, beyond the environmental costs,

00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:44.226
there's a segment of nutrition science,

00:35:44.226 --> 00:35:46.140
as well as animal rights activists,

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:47.850
that are arguing for the elimination

00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:50.160
of meat consumption altogether.

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:52.680
But, given the global rise
in consumption patterns,

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:55.823
this doesn't seem to be the
most likely future outcome.

00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:59.860
So, despite the nutritional
benefits of consuming meat,

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:02.220
there are significant
health and environmental

00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:04.700
costs of consumption, as well.

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:07.060
That being said, as
we'll hear about today,

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:10.440
our species has a very long
relationship with red meat.

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:12.740
It is one of the hallmarks
of human evolution.

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:15.160
So, the question I leave you with,

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:17.280
and one that I borrowed from Ajit Varki,

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:19.610
has meat in human evolution gone from

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:21.723
a blessing to a curse?

00:36:21.723 --> 00:36:23.607
Thank you.

00:36:23.607 --> 00:36:26.430
(applause)

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:28.300
- Okay, so I'm an old, low ranking male.

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:30.320
So, that means I should
be good at hunting.

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:32.460
But it kind of depresses me to think

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:35.780
the measure of success is
how good a hunter we are.

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:37.180
I'm a vegetarian.

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:38.093
Well, almost.

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:40.770
So, that's what I'd like to be.

00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:42.780
But, still, it's an important issue.

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:44.883
So, let's talk about this.

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:48.460
So, I want to talk about the origins

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:51.170
of what I'll call the
human predatory pattern.

00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:52.310
And the reason I'm calling it that

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:54.780
is because that's what Jessica
Thompson and colleagues

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:59.150
are calling it in a paper in
press in Current Anthropology.

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:00.938
Emphasizing the fact that hominins

00:37:00.938 --> 00:37:04.820
are killing animals
larger than themselves.

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:08.630
Chimps can kill animals the
same size as themselves,

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:11.700
namely other adult chimpanzees.

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:13.203
But they don't eat them.

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:17.510
And humans, of course, are
different in this respect.

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:19.731
So, the standard kind of model,

00:37:19.731 --> 00:37:23.380
which is, in some ways, the justification

00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:27.470
for the material we've been
hearing about chimpanzees,

00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:30.210
is that you have a last common ancestor

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:32.730
that was hunting in the chimp style.

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:36.408
And then, out of that comes
the human predatory pattern.

00:37:36.408 --> 00:37:37.241
There are...

00:37:37.241 --> 00:37:40.500
A slight modification of that comes from

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:43.350
people like the Jessica Thompson team.

00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:45.200
And, I think, Brianna.

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:47.730
Where you can have that
chimp style hunting

00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:50.320
and then, in the Australopithecine era,

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:52.300
they may or may not have
been hunting very much.

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:55.030
Difficult for them to catch a red colobus.

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:57.294
Not too many around in the Savannah.

00:37:57.294 --> 00:38:01.270
And get interested in
meat and animal products.

00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:05.760
And then, out of that, you get
an interest in fat processing

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:08.100
from the marrow and other organs.

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:11.520
And, out of that, coming
the scavenging and hunting.

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:12.870
But here's my point.

00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:17.283
All of this assumes that
the stuff is eaten raw.

00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:21.500
Well that conforms to conventional wisdom.

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:24.650
So, conventional wisdom
sees Australopithecenes

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:27.730
giving rise to Homo erectus,
then Homo heidelbergensis,

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:32.040
and, finally, the finest
kind of human you can have,

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:34.622
represented here by the
president of Harvard,

00:38:34.622 --> 00:38:37.160
(laughter)

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:40.400
emerging out of the president of Yale.

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.650
(laughter)

00:38:49.565 --> 00:38:53.350
And the point, of course, is
the standard story is that

00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:55.630
this was raw meat that was responsible

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:57.390
for this big transformation.

00:38:57.390 --> 00:38:59.499
Nothing much happening
after you get Homo erectus.

00:38:59.499 --> 00:39:03.273
And that fire comes in some
time quite a lot later.

00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:06.400
And maybe that's true.

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.760
But I doubt it myself.

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:09.280
I think that fire came in earlier.

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:12.410
But what is certainly true is that

00:39:12.410 --> 00:39:15.935
raw meat is a difficult
food for people nowadays.

00:39:15.935 --> 00:39:18.490
It's rare to find hunters and gatherers

00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:19.990
eating raw meat at all,

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:22.950
as you see from a survey around the world.

00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:25.240
And, in Africa, there is no record

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:27.930
of people eating raw meat.

00:39:27.930 --> 00:39:32.160
And, to the extent that we have data

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:34.640
on what happens when
people do eat raw meat,

00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:36.910
which we have to go to urban raw-foodists,

00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:39.973
people who are able to survive
on supermarkets and so on,

00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:44.442
what you find, following
the red line here,

00:39:44.442 --> 00:39:49.442
is that raw food is a
great way of losing weight.

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:56.030
It shows that you lose body mass index,

00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:59.647
quite predictably, by eating
a lot of your diet raw.

00:39:59.647 --> 00:40:02.010
And this includes both vegans

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:04.680
and people who were eating their meat raw.

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:06.340
And then the blue line shows you that

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:08.930
raw food is quite a
good contraceptive, too,

00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:13.930
because, by the time you're
eating 50% of your food raw,

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:16.419
if you are a woman, then...

00:40:16.419 --> 00:40:18.464
Sorry, 100% of your food raw,

00:40:18.464 --> 00:40:21.570
then you have a 50% chance of having

00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:23.720
your reproductive system
totally shut down.

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:25.370
And that is...

00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:27.840
Despite the fact that they're eating

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:31.593
just about as high quality of
raw diet as you can imagine.

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:35.400
And having no seasonal stresses and so on.

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:39.420
Okay, so, it's quite clear
that cooking does something.

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:42.070
It increases the energy value, we know,

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:44.400
for starch and protein and plant lipids.

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:46.785
Now, here is the fact
that you should remember

00:40:46.785 --> 00:40:49.840
beyond anything else that
I'm going to say today.

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:53.800
Nobody knows what the consequence
is of cooking animal fats.

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:55.670
We do know about cooking plant lipids.

00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:59.400
That increases the digestibility
of the plant lipids.

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:01.160
You get more energy value out of it.

00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:03.110
But no one has done it with animal fats.

00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:03.943
Which is crazy.

00:41:03.943 --> 00:41:05.700
And, if you think about the fact

00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:10.010
of how much more delicious
a lump of suet is

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:11.330
when it's been cooked,

00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:13.040
then it seems very likely that

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:17.310
your food perception system
is tied to the consequences,

00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:19.720
biologically, in your body.

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:21.280
But the fact is that we're not sure.

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:24.160
So, it seems very likely that raw meat

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:29.160
has got low value compared
to both cooked meat...

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:31.080
I mean, that's what we do know.

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:33.540
And the point I wanna say here is marrow.

00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:35.940
So, what I really want
to emphasize here is that

00:41:37.170 --> 00:41:39.480
the consequences of cooking meat

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:41.640
are very substantially beneficial.

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:43.500
The consequences of cooking marrow,

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:48.500
with its fat content, may be a bit less.

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:49.820
So, we'll think about this in terms

00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:53.840
of safety and palatability
and time to ingest.

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:56.673
I'm not gonna talk about digestibility

00:41:56.673 --> 00:41:57.510
and the cost of digestion,

00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:59.690
because we don't know anything
in terms of the marrow.

00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:01.370
So, that's pretty crazy.

00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:02.700
One of the most important foods,

00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:06.307
probably, in human
evolution, fat from animals.

00:42:06.307 --> 00:42:09.630
And cooking, the signature
feature of the human diet.

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:11.930
And yet we don't know
what the consequences

00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:14.703
is of cooking fat for the energy gain.

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:19.070
Alright, so, we know cooking's
biologically important.

00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:20.270
We know it raises the food value.

00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:22.040
It probably does it differently
for different foods.

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:24.900
I want to propose something that will

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:26.560
annoy several of my colleagues.

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:29.190
Which is that, before cooking,

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:32.070
hominin meat eating was less important

00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:34.733
and hominin fat eating was more important.

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:36.952
So, the first thing I want to say

00:42:36.952 --> 00:42:41.952
is about the dangers of
eating from a dead zebra

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:45.040
that you happen to find there.

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:46.183
It is disgusting.

00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:51.527
So, Sonia Ragir pointed
out some time ago that

00:42:54.791 --> 00:42:58.120
the meat is dangerous when you find it

00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:00.410
because of bacterial growth.

00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:04.949
And Alex Smith, in my lab,
did some nice experiments

00:43:04.949 --> 00:43:08.870
showing that, if you compare
the rate of bacterial growth

00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:12.313
on raw meat compared to marrow,

00:43:12.313 --> 00:43:15.300
then it grows much faster on raw meat.

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:20.240
And whereas, if you cook it,
then it's safer very quickly.

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:22.290
And internal marrow is really safe.

00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:25.110
So, meat you can sometimes get away

00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:29.980
with cutting the outside bits
off and taking what's inside.

00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:32.460
But, even then, it decays pretty quickly.

00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:35.950
And it is going to
remain rather dangerous.

00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:38.970
Which I think is why
chimpanzees, by the way,

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:40.190
don't scavenge much.

00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:42.140
There was implication earlier that

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:44.810
they sort of don't
recognize dead meat as food.

00:43:44.810 --> 00:43:45.643
I think they do.

00:43:45.643 --> 00:43:47.380
It's just that they're
pretty cautious about it.

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:50.350
And occasionally they do scavenge.

00:43:50.350 --> 00:43:52.000
Okay, so, now here's a major
point I wanted to make.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.313
That hominins without
fire couldn't hunt much.

00:43:56.170 --> 00:43:59.090
'Cause there's just not
much time for hunting.

00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:01.470
So, here is a data on the amount of time

00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:03.620
that chimpanzees spend feeding,

00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:04.840
which is incredibly frustrating

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:06.720
to teams from National Geographic.

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:08.910
They kind of want to see
chimps doing fancy things.

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:10.810
'Cause, in fact, all
they do is just sit there

00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:12.023
eating most of the time.

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:15.420
And there's variation among the sites.

00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:18.033
And the ones at the bottom, Bossou,

00:44:18.033 --> 00:44:20.150
they're eating quite a lot of human foods

00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:22.520
dug up from fields and that sort of thing.

00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:26.580
But, overall, we got
close on 50% of their day

00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:28.180
is spent literally just chewing.

00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:32.950
And that means that they
can't do other things.

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:34.973
Such as write poetry or go hunting.

00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:39.500
Here, what we got is a
slightly strange plot

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:42.100
of the distribution of
the time spent feeding

00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:43.813
in nonhuman primates.

00:44:45.539 --> 00:44:47.306
And you see there's a pretty steady rise

00:44:47.306 --> 00:44:51.550
as body size increases on the bottom axis.

00:44:51.550 --> 00:44:53.420
And so, by the time you are a Homo,

00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:55.870
you should be eating for something like,

00:44:55.870 --> 00:44:57.030
chewing for something like

00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:59.020
50 to actually something slightly higher

00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:01.220
than 50% of the day.

00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:02.600
That's what you should be doing.

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:03.490
But you're not.

00:45:03.490 --> 00:45:05.040
In fact, what humans do is they chew

00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:07.570
for less than an hour a day.

00:45:07.570 --> 00:45:09.343
It's a relatively trivial time.

00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:13.750
And meat eating does not help that much

00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:15.765
if you are a raw eater.

00:45:15.765 --> 00:45:18.000
So, here are some estimates.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.330
It's difficult to get normally

00:45:19.330 --> 00:45:23.290
for total time it takes to chew a carcass.

00:45:23.290 --> 00:45:26.360
Because it's relatively
rare that you can see

00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:28.070
all the bits of the carcass

00:45:28.070 --> 00:45:30.860
and how much they have
been eaten by chimps.

00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:33.690
But this suggests that,
when you take, for instance,

00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:35.207
a baboon that weighs a certain amount

00:45:35.207 --> 00:45:37.540
and you estimate 80% of it was eaten.

00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:40.060
And you total up all
the eating that was done

00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:41.310
during that period.

00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:44.100
You can see, there's a total
of nine chimpanzee hours.

00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:45.920
And the net result is that

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:48.640
you're eating meat at about the rate that

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:50.980
you are some of the higher quality fruits

00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:53.300
in terms of calorie intake.

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:57.474
There's a note here saying
that Ian Gilby thinks that

00:45:57.474 --> 00:46:00.730
I'm underestimating the rate of eating.

00:46:00.730 --> 00:46:02.050
And I'm sure I'm underestimating it

00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:04.380
for the initial phase of eating

00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:06.470
where they're eating the softer bits.

00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:08.360
But we have yet to get
very good data on this,

00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:11.660
so it may turn out that the
underestimate is important.

00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:14.540
But, nevertheless, that's
what we got so far.

00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:19.058
Okay, so, chimps don't hunt
for very long at a time.

00:46:19.058 --> 00:46:21.850
Here, you see some estimates.

00:46:21.850 --> 00:46:25.700
All between 15 minutes and half an hour.

00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:26.660
That sort of thing.

00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:27.580
If they get into a hunt.

00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:29.610
And, after that, there, they give up.

00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:32.930
And this is not affected by

00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:35.772
how often they're overall killing.

00:46:35.772 --> 00:46:38.930
There's this big range we've seen before.

00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:42.110
Sometimes one a month
and sometimes 10 a month.

00:46:42.110 --> 00:46:44.590
But, nevertheless,
they're always just having

00:46:44.590 --> 00:46:48.350
this low rate of, this
low duration of the hunt.

00:46:48.350 --> 00:46:49.750
And you can see why.

00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:52.110
Here is how the feeding
time is distributed

00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:55.000
in a particular individual
from dawn until dusk.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.730
The red is when he's chewing.

00:46:56.730 --> 00:46:58.510
So, there's just not much
time between chewing.

00:46:58.510 --> 00:46:59.830
And, by the way, when they stop chewing,

00:46:59.830 --> 00:47:00.750
what are they doing?

00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:05.600
Mostly, lying around in order
to be able to digest the food.

00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:07.900
So, the typical pattern
is you go up into a tree.

00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:09.040
You eat for 45 minutes.

00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:09.980
And then you come lie down.

00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:12.440
And then wait for the stomach to be empty

00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:13.640
and then you go up again.

00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:14.850
That's what seems to be happening.

00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:16.280
So, there's variation among chimps.

00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:18.250
And here's a bunch of different days.

00:47:18.250 --> 00:47:21.460
And you see, some days, there
is very, very little time

00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:22.920
to do anything other than eat.

00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:23.937
And sometimes more.

00:47:23.937 --> 00:47:25.540
And it balances out across days.

00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:26.373
And so on.

00:47:26.373 --> 00:47:27.727
But you can look at this and you can say,

00:47:27.727 --> 00:47:30.840
"Okay, let's look at the
interfeeding interval."

00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:33.210
How much time is there
between what you gotta do,

00:47:33.210 --> 00:47:36.300
which is to get food into your belly.

00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:40.750
And the answer is that
the median of 20 minutes,

00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:41.990
the mean of 40 minutes.

00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:44.340
This is old data from Gombe.

00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:47.730
But that compares with
the mean hunt duration

00:47:47.730 --> 00:47:50.540
of a quarter of an hour, half an hour.

00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:52.980
So, it's about the same.

00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:55.290
And the implication here is that,

00:47:55.290 --> 00:47:56.420
if you are chewing a lot,

00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:57.880
there's just no time to go hunting.

00:47:57.880 --> 00:47:59.170
So, sorry.

00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:01.630
Now, humans, obviously,
we're much less constrained

00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:02.510
by eating time.

00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:04.390
And, actually, funnily enough,

00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:08.310
there is no paper that has
looked at when humans eat.

00:48:08.310 --> 00:48:11.873
But this looks like a very
confident assertion that,

00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:13.710
among hunter-gatherers,

00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:15.020
only one regular meal is eaten in camp

00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:16.980
and it's at night after
people have returned

00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:17.920
from the day's hunting.

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:19.839
That's sort of typical pattern

00:48:19.839 --> 00:48:22.533
as you go into the earlier ethnographies.

00:48:23.578 --> 00:48:27.550
So, humans are able to spend long hours

00:48:27.550 --> 00:48:29.550
during the day on the hunt.

00:48:29.550 --> 00:48:32.270
And here you see a distribution

00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:34.310
across different hunter gatherer societies

00:48:34.310 --> 00:48:36.130
for men and women.

00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:38.457
And the men are spending, on average,

00:48:38.457 --> 00:48:40.760
just over four hours a day.

00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:42.080
Which means that it is possible

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:43.880
for them to do something that chimpanzees

00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:44.830
could not possibly do.

00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:48.570
And, therefore, I think that
a raw meat eating hominin

00:48:48.570 --> 00:48:50.163
could not have done, either.

00:48:51.050 --> 00:48:53.770
Well, meanwhile, so, could they go out

00:48:53.770 --> 00:48:58.500
and track around looking for their food?

00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:01.533
Foraging, hunting.

00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:05.190
Dan Lieberman and his colleague Bramble

00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:09.280
have drawn attention to
a whole bunch of features

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:11.290
in our skeletons which indicate that

00:49:11.290 --> 00:49:14.200
Homo is uniquely derived in an ability

00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:16.810
to have endurance walking
or endurance running.

00:49:16.810 --> 00:49:18.542
Tramping around across the Savannah

00:49:18.542 --> 00:49:23.542
looking for opportunities to
either scavenge or to kill.

00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:25.290
Well, that doesn't seem very easy

00:49:25.290 --> 00:49:26.600
if you've got a great big belly

00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:30.380
that we've been hearing
about with those flared ribs.

00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:33.030
And you're keeping it full
of stuff all the time.

00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:36.740
So, you're asking a gorilla
full of vegetation, as it were,

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:41.200
to go running off for two or three hours.

00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:42.590
I don't think so.

00:49:42.590 --> 00:49:45.560
I think one reason is
it's got a large gut.

00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:47.290
And that large gut is full

00:49:47.290 --> 00:49:49.920
for a tremendous amount of the time.

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:53.350
And then I actually think
there's probably another reason.

00:49:53.350 --> 00:49:54.880
This is a little bit speculative, really.

00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:59.110
But I think that creatures before fire

00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:05.370
would have needed to keep
warm at night with hair.

00:50:05.370 --> 00:50:06.940
And, as long as they had to do that,

00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:09.850
then they couldn't lose
heat easily during the day.

00:50:09.850 --> 00:50:10.845
So, it's very difficult for me to imagine

00:50:10.845 --> 00:50:13.132
an endurance runner, in particular,

00:50:13.132 --> 00:50:16.460
being able to do that before fire.

00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:20.070
Okay, so, what I'm saying so far is that

00:50:20.070 --> 00:50:22.370
meat eating would have been less extensive

00:50:22.370 --> 00:50:23.900
before the control of fire.

00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:27.290
Because of the lack of
safety in the raw meat

00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:30.260
and the fact of chewing for so long

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:34.175
meant that you had, also,
large guts full of food.

00:50:34.175 --> 00:50:36.413
You couldn't run and hunt.

00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:41.350
And I suspect, when we know about it,

00:50:41.350 --> 00:50:44.831
that the relative value of
raw meat compared to raw fat

00:50:44.831 --> 00:50:47.673
is gonna be relatively low.

00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:51.940
Okay, so what did hominins
eat before cooking?

00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:55.400
Because I do think that
it's reasonable to imagine

00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:56.921
that there's been a phase in which

00:50:56.921 --> 00:51:01.230
hominins were using animal
products before cooking.

00:51:01.230 --> 00:51:06.230
And the safe bit are the ones
that are enclosed in bone.

00:51:06.570 --> 00:51:08.820
And that would be marrow or brain

00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:12.800
from below the exposed
surfaces is what you wanna do.

00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:16.630
And, certainly, marrow
is an important food

00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:18.190
for hunter-gatherers.

00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:19.690
Here is data for the Hadza

00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:21.530
and how many of them are eaten raw.

00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:24.034
So, by the time you're eating
big animals, like buffalo,

00:51:24.034 --> 00:51:28.550
James Oliver finds that 80%, or 70-80%,

00:51:28.550 --> 00:51:31.110
of the limb bones are eaten raw.

00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:33.890
So, that all seems just fine.

00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:35.210
But there would be a difference

00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:37.290
if you're eating them
raw from eating cooked.

00:51:37.290 --> 00:51:40.700
Because, nowadays, there is an ability

00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:45.410
to use both the marrow
in the shaft of the bone

00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:50.060
and the fat in the trabecular bone,

00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:52.800
or the cancellous bone area.

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:55.340
Which you're very difficult to
get at just with your teeth.

00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:56.670
You really have to boil it up

00:51:56.670 --> 00:51:58.680
to be able to release the grease.

00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:00.860
And, until you have cooking,

00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:03.490
you're not gonna be able
to use that very much.

00:52:03.490 --> 00:52:05.001
And then there's a difference in

00:52:05.001 --> 00:52:09.030
the kind of marrow that
is gonna be preferred.

00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:12.557
So, Binford showed very nicely that

00:52:12.557 --> 00:52:14.643
there is a good relationship

00:52:14.643 --> 00:52:18.430
between the degree of
unsaturated fat in the marrow

00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:20.440
and the preference.

00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:25.229
Here, you see, for the Nunamiut
people that he was studying,

00:52:25.229 --> 00:52:28.940
that the more unsaturated marrow there is,

00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:32.670
then the more the bone is preferred.

00:52:32.670 --> 00:52:37.350
So, unsaturated is much
nicer than saturated fat

00:52:37.350 --> 00:52:39.090
when it's eaten raw.

00:52:39.090 --> 00:52:40.869
And that is probably

00:52:40.869 --> 00:52:44.150
because it has got a lower melting point.

00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:46.560
And, with a lower melting point, probably,

00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:51.020
I think it will turn out to
have a lower cost of digestion,

00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:53.920
because the body is going
to have to work less hard

00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:56.660
to reduce it to the tiny, tiny particles

00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:58.410
just a few angstroms across

00:52:58.410 --> 00:53:01.001
that have to be reduced before it can go

00:53:01.001 --> 00:53:03.863
across the intestinal wall.

00:53:04.900 --> 00:53:08.540
So, where are the unsaturated fats found?

00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:12.810
They are found more at the
nether ends of the limbs.

00:53:12.810 --> 00:53:16.050
So, if you take a typical ungular foreleg,

00:53:16.050 --> 00:53:17.780
you find that the saturated fats

00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:20.350
tend to be richer close to the shoulder

00:53:20.350 --> 00:53:22.320
and throughout the axial skeleton.

00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:27.320
And the unsaturated fats are
richer at the distal parts.

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:30.170
Which nobody understands why that is.

00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:31.700
I mean, there's the sort of suggestion

00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:34.830
unsaturated fats, having
lower melting points,

00:53:34.830 --> 00:53:36.240
they may be sort of more flexible.

00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:39.402
They may allow more flexibility.

00:53:39.402 --> 00:53:41.333
That's a bit speculative.

00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:46.520
Okay, so, preference for unsaturated fats.

00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:50.840
And then there's the question of brains.

00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:54.950
So, the limb marrow is
great for most of the year.

00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:59.070
But you see here, in a couple of examples,

00:53:59.070 --> 00:54:04.070
that femur marrow is very poor
during periods of the year

00:54:04.130 --> 00:54:06.340
when the animals are in poor condition.

00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:08.860
Going right down to 20% fat.

00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:11.830
And that's a point
mirroring what's happening

00:54:11.830 --> 00:54:13.550
with the kidney fat.

00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:17.900
At which you can expect there
will be rejection of the food.

00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:21.093
So, here's claims from
Binford saying that,

00:54:21.093 --> 00:54:24.180
if the caribou is in too poor condition,

00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:26.440
you break open the bone
and it's soft and runny,

00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:27.893
then goodbye.

00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:32.580
During those periods,
brains should be okay.

00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:37.580
Now, here is Kim Hill
saying that he loved...

00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:40.510
Well, he's saying the Ache and the Hiwi,

00:54:40.510 --> 00:54:43.840
hunter-gatherers in Paraguay
and Venezuela, love brains.

00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:46.463
And he says, grossly,
that he loved it himself.

00:54:48.140 --> 00:54:49.620
I asked him if he ate it raw.

00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:50.453
He said no.

00:54:52.698 --> 00:54:54.023
But you could.

00:54:54.910 --> 00:54:56.280
As long as it's reasonably fresh.

00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:58.480
There is decay that goes on there.

00:54:58.480 --> 00:54:59.950
Of course, the problems
with brains is that

00:54:59.950 --> 00:55:01.010
they're hard to extract.

00:55:01.010 --> 00:55:03.440
And, if you're a hominin,
they're embedded very often

00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:04.480
with things with horns.

00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:07.040
And the skull is really heavy.

00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:08.250
So, it's not that great.

00:55:08.250 --> 00:55:13.250
But it is good, because
the quality of the fat

00:55:13.450 --> 00:55:14.870
always stays high.

00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:17.623
It's the last thing that
you will lose fat from.

00:55:18.751 --> 00:55:20.605
And then goodbye.

00:55:20.605 --> 00:55:21.990
(laughter)

00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:23.890
So, my conclusion is that,

00:55:23.890 --> 00:55:27.463
if the early Homo diets were raw,

00:55:27.463 --> 00:55:29.660
then you've got to put up with the notion

00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:33.620
that there was extensive chewing,
minimal time for hunting,

00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:36.220
and, I think, no endurance running.

00:55:36.220 --> 00:55:40.450
And they would be eating particularly

00:55:40.450 --> 00:55:42.410
from the fat rich areas.

00:55:42.410 --> 00:55:45.110
And there'll be more marrow
than in cooked diets.

00:55:45.110 --> 00:55:48.130
There'd be more marrow
especially from the distal bones

00:55:48.130 --> 00:55:51.610
and especially from the brain.

00:55:51.610 --> 00:55:55.373
So, overall, more scavenging,
more fat, and less meat.

00:55:57.150 --> 00:56:02.150
Overall, the kind of concept
that I was referring to earlier

00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:04.900
of chimpanzee-style hunting giving rise

00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:06.190
to an interest in animal products

00:56:06.190 --> 00:56:08.190
and percussive fat-processing,

00:56:08.190 --> 00:56:09.890
breaking open those limb bones,

00:56:09.890 --> 00:56:14.890
and then, finally, getting
the human predatory pattern.

00:56:15.810 --> 00:56:19.200
That seems to me a great
way to think about things.

00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:22.520
And then we should think
about the first three stages

00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:24.740
as involving raw meat.

00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:27.530
But I don't think you can
go very far into the fourth

00:56:27.530 --> 00:56:29.610
without making it cooked.

00:56:29.610 --> 00:56:31.347
So, I have a different concept

00:56:31.347 --> 00:56:36.100
of the Harvard and the Yale presence.

00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:36.933
Thank you.

00:56:36.933 --> 00:56:39.096
(applause)
