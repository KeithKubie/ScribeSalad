00:00:00.385 --> 00:00:02.515
Now that we hopefully have a conceptual understanding...

00:00:02.515 --> 00:00:05.350
...of what a surface integral like this COULD represent,

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.073
...I want to think about how we can actually construct...

00:00:08.073 --> 00:00:10.009
...a unit vector...

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.669
...a unit normal vector, at any point on the surface.

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:15.483
And to do that, I will assume...

00:00:15.483 --> 00:00:18.221
...that our surface can be parametrized...

00:00:18.221 --> 00:00:21.282
...by the position vector function, r...

00:00:21.282 --> 00:00:23.432
...and r is a function of two parameters.

00:00:23.432 --> 00:00:27.569
It's a function of u, and it is a function of v.

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:29.529
You give me a u and a v and...

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.489
...that will essentially specify...

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.002
...a point on this two-dimensional surface right over here.

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:37.931
It could be bent, so it kind of exists in three-dimensional space...

00:00:37.931 --> 00:00:42.738
But a u and a v will specify a given point on this surface.

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:46.865
Now, let's think about what the directions of r...

00:00:46.865 --> 00:00:48.983
...the partial of r with respect to...

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.188
...the partial of r with respect to u looks like...

00:00:52.188 --> 00:00:54.524
...and what the direction of the partial of r...

00:00:54.524 --> 00:00:57.692
...the partial of r with respect to v looks like.

00:00:57.953 --> 00:00:59.989
So let's say that we're at some...

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:01.289
...we're at some point.

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:03.729
We're at some point, (u,v).

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:06.635
So for some (u,v), if you'd find the position vector...

00:01:06.635 --> 00:01:09.457
...it takes us to that point on the surface right over there.

00:01:09.457 --> 00:01:12.651
Now let's say that we increment u just a little bit.

00:01:12.651 --> 00:01:14.423
And as we increment u just a little bit,

00:01:14.423 --> 00:01:16.655
...we're going to get to another point on our surface,

00:01:16.655 --> 00:01:18.417
...and let's say that other point on the surface...

00:01:18.417 --> 00:01:19.461
...is right over there.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:20.826
So what would r...

00:01:20.826 --> 00:01:23.121
What would this r_u vector look like?

00:01:23.121 --> 00:01:24.881
Well its magnitude is essentially going to be..

00:01:24.881 --> 00:01:26.598
...dependent on how fast it's happening,

00:01:26.598 --> 00:01:28.929
...how fast we're moving towards that point,

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:31.261
...but its direction is going to be in that direction.

00:01:31.261 --> 00:01:32.806
It's going to be towards that point.

00:01:32.806 --> 00:01:34.251
It's going be along the surface.

00:01:34.251 --> 00:01:36.217
We're going from one point on the surface to another.

00:01:36.217 --> 00:01:38.760
It's essentially going to be tangent to the surface at that point.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.240
And I could draw a little bit bigger.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.181
It would look something like that.

00:01:42.181 --> 00:01:45.057
r... r_u.

00:01:45.057 --> 00:01:46.510
So I just zoomed in right over here.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.003
Now let's go back to this point.

00:01:49.003 --> 00:01:51.585
And now let's make v a little bit bigger.

00:01:51.585 --> 00:01:53.448
And let's say if we make v a little bit bigger,

00:01:53.448 --> 00:01:55.101
...we go to this point right over here.

00:01:55.101 --> 00:01:58.625
So then our position vector, r, would point to this point.

00:01:58.625 --> 00:02:00.970
And so what would r_v look like?

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.817
Well its magnitude, once again, would be dependent on...

00:02:02.817 --> 00:02:05.634
...how fast we're going there, but the direction is what's interesting.

00:02:05.634 --> 00:02:09.078
The direction would also be tangential to the surface.

00:02:09.078 --> 00:02:11.090
We're going from one point on the surface to another...

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.416
...as we change v.

00:02:12.416 --> 00:02:15.356
So r_v might look something like that.

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:17.853
And they're not necessarily...

00:02:17.853 --> 00:02:19.759
These two aren't necessarily perpendicular to each other.

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:21.481
In fact, the way I drew them, they're not perpendicular.

00:02:21.835 --> 00:02:25.869
So r_v is like this, but they're both tangential to the plane.

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:28.266
They're both essentially telling us, right at that point,

00:02:28.266 --> 00:02:31.139
...what is the tangent? What is the slope in that...

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:34.138
...in the u direction, or in the v direction?

00:02:34.138 --> 00:02:35.720
Now, this is...

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.067
When you have two...

00:02:37.067 --> 00:02:38.668
When you have two vectors that are...

00:02:38.668 --> 00:02:40.267
...that are tangential to the plane,

00:02:40.267 --> 00:02:42.125
...and they're not the same vector, these are actually...

00:02:42.125 --> 00:02:43.435
...already specifying...

00:02:43.435 --> 00:02:45.784
...these are already kind of determining a plane.

00:02:45.784 --> 00:02:48.417
And so you can imagine a plane that looks something like this.

00:02:48.417 --> 00:02:50.868
If you took linear combinations of these two things,

00:02:50.868 --> 00:02:54.099
...you would get a plane that both of these would lie on.

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.437
Now, we've done this before, but I'll re-visit it.

00:02:57.437 --> 00:02:59.669
What happens when I take the cross product...

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:02.684
...of r_u and r_v?

00:03:02.684 --> 00:03:05.673
What happens when I take the cross product?

00:03:05.673 --> 00:03:08.573
Well first, this is going to give us another vector.

00:03:08.573 --> 00:03:10.384
It's going to give us a vector...

00:03:10.384 --> 00:03:15.082
...a vector that is perpendicular to both...

00:03:15.421 --> 00:03:19.051
...to r_u AND r_v.

00:03:19.051 --> 00:03:20.823
Or another way to think about it is...

00:03:20.823 --> 00:03:22.867
...this plane, that these...

00:03:22.867 --> 00:03:23.716
...when you take the cross product...

00:03:23.716 --> 00:03:26.485
...this plane is essentially a tangential plane...

00:03:26.485 --> 00:03:27.462
...to the surface.

00:03:27.462 --> 00:03:28.984
And if something is going to be perpendicular...

00:03:28.984 --> 00:03:30.452
...to both of these characters,

00:03:30.452 --> 00:03:32.555
...it's going to have to be normal to them...

00:03:32.555 --> 00:03:33.723
...or, it's definitely going to be perpendicular...

00:03:33.723 --> 00:03:35.442
...to both of them, but it's going to be normal...

00:03:35.442 --> 00:03:36.467
...to this plane.

00:03:36.467 --> 00:03:37.905
Which is essentially going to be...

00:03:37.905 --> 00:03:40.871
...perpendicular to the surface itself.

00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:42.154
So this right over here...

00:03:42.154 --> 00:03:44.347
...is going to be A normal vector.

00:03:44.347 --> 00:03:45.774
This is... I'll write it...

00:03:45.774 --> 00:03:46.956
Well, let me just write it this way.

00:03:46.956 --> 00:03:48.622
This is A normal vector.

00:03:49.176 --> 00:03:50.816
I'm not saying THE unit normal...

00:03:50.816 --> 00:03:52.906
I'm not saying THE normal vector, 'cause you have...

00:03:52.906 --> 00:03:54.442
...you could have different normal vectors of...

00:03:54.442 --> 00:03:55.691
...different magnitudes.

00:03:55.691 --> 00:03:58.861
This is A normal vector, when you take the cross product.

00:03:58.861 --> 00:04:01.641
And we can even think about what direction it's pointing in.

00:04:01.641 --> 00:04:04.477
And so when you have "something" cross "something else"...

00:04:04.477 --> 00:04:06.417
...the easiest way I remember how to do it is...

00:04:06.417 --> 00:04:07.995
...you point your left thumb...

00:04:07.995 --> 00:04:09.724
Oh, sorry. You point your RIGHT thumb...

00:04:09.724 --> 00:04:11.439
...in the direction of the first vector...

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:13.870
So, in this case, r_u.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:14.839
So let me see if I can...

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:15.709
...if I can draw this.

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:17.771
I'm literally looking at my hand and trying to draw it.

00:04:18.402 --> 00:04:20.443
So you put your right thumb...

00:04:20.443 --> 00:04:22.303
-- so this is a right-hand rule, essentially --

00:04:22.303 --> 00:04:24.339
...in the direction of the first vector...

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:28.200
...and then you put your index finger in the direction of...

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.634
...the second vector...

00:04:29.634 --> 00:04:31.102
...right over here.

00:04:31.102 --> 00:04:32.305
So this is the second vector.

00:04:32.305 --> 00:04:34.442
So that's the direction of my index finger.

00:04:35.026 --> 00:04:37.968
So my index finger is going to look something like...

00:04:37.968 --> 00:04:39.504
...that.

00:04:39.504 --> 00:04:40.702
And then you bend...

00:04:40.702 --> 00:04:43.164
...you bend your middle finger inward...

00:04:43.164 --> 00:04:45.367
...and that will tell you the direction of the cross product.

00:04:45.367 --> 00:04:48.054
So if I bend my middle finger inward,

00:04:48.054 --> 00:04:49.533
...it will look something...

00:04:49.533 --> 00:04:52.134
...it will look something like this.

00:04:52.134 --> 00:04:54.651
And then of course, my other two fingers are just going to be...

00:04:54.651 --> 00:04:56.787
...folded in like that, and they're not really relevant.

00:04:56.787 --> 00:04:59.389
But my other two fingers and my hand looks like that.

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:00.924
And so that tells us the direction.

00:05:00.924 --> 00:05:02.265
The direction is going to be like that.

00:05:02.265 --> 00:05:03.616
It's going to be upward-facing.

00:05:03.616 --> 00:05:05.635
That's important, because you have normal vectors.

00:05:05.635 --> 00:05:06.672
One could...

00:05:06.672 --> 00:05:09.208
Or there's two directions of "normalcy," I guess you could say.

00:05:09.208 --> 00:05:11.156
One is going out like that...

00:05:11.156 --> 00:05:12.182
...outwards...

00:05:12.182 --> 00:05:12.954
...or I guess...

00:05:12.954 --> 00:05:14.434
...in the upward direction...

00:05:14.434 --> 00:05:15.903
...one would be going downwards,

00:05:15.903 --> 00:05:17.886
...or going -- I guess you could say -- into the surface.

00:05:17.886 --> 00:05:19.524
But the way I have set it up right now,

00:05:19.524 --> 00:05:20.695
...this would be going outwards.

00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:22.415
It would be A...

00:05:22.415 --> 00:05:24.878
It would be A normal vector...

00:05:24.878 --> 00:05:25.901
...to the surface.

00:05:25.901 --> 00:05:28.068
Now, in order to go from A normal vector...

00:05:28.068 --> 00:05:31.016
...to the UNIT normal vector,

00:05:31.016 --> 00:05:32.490
...we just have to normalize it.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:33.684
We just have to divide this...

00:05:33.684 --> 00:05:35.173
...by its magnitude.

00:05:35.173 --> 00:05:37.151
So now we have our drumroll.

00:05:37.151 --> 00:05:38.235
The unit vector...

00:05:38.235 --> 00:05:39.837
And it's going to essentially be...

00:05:39.837 --> 00:05:41.685
It's going to be a function of u...

00:05:41.685 --> 00:05:42.422
It's going to be...

00:05:42.422 --> 00:05:44.510
...a function of u and v.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:45.888
You give me a u or a v...

00:05:45.888 --> 00:05:46.600
...and I'll give you a...

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.099
...that unit normal vector.

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:50.090
It is going to be equal to...

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.058
...the partial of r...

00:05:52.058 --> 00:05:53.998
...the partial of r with respect to u...

00:05:53.998 --> 00:05:55.400
...crossed with...

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.052
...the partial of r with respect to v...

00:05:58.052 --> 00:05:58.580
That just...

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.090
Now that gives us A normal vector,

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:01.451
but it hasn't been normalized.

00:06:01.451 --> 00:06:03.054
So we want to divide...

00:06:03.054 --> 00:06:04.550
...by the magnitude...

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.785
We want to divide by the magnitude...

00:06:06.785 --> 00:06:08.168
...of the exact same thing.

00:06:08.168 --> 00:06:11.307
r_u crossed with r_v.

00:06:14.707 --> 00:06:15.417
And we're done!

00:06:15.417 --> 00:06:17.361
We have constructed a unit normal vector.

00:06:17.361 --> 00:06:21.569
And in future videos, we'll actually do this with concrete examples.
