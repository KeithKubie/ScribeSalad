00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:07.540
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: OK. Good afternoon. Welcome.
My name is Alana Weiss from the Google EDU

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:13.910
team and today, it is my pleasure to welcome
Stan Slap to the Leading@Google series. For

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.910
Stan Slap, emotional commitment for managers
is the Holy Grail for explosive results.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:25.700
Today, he'll speak to his first book titled
"Bury My Heart at Conference Room B: The Unbeatable

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:31.220
Impact of Truly Committed Managers," which
was on the top five on the bestseller lists

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.940
of the New York Times, USA Today, and the
Wall Street Journal. It was also named one

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.270
of the best books of year by Inc Magazine
and Fast Company.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:46.900
Stan Slap is the president of the international
consulting company called, by a remarkable

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:54.600
coincidence, Slap. And following a history
of accomplishments as a CEO and advisor, Stan

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.399
is now focused on influencing managers at
today's fastest growing companies through

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.330
his work as a corporate strategist and trainer.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.640
Stan Slap is intent on making a profound difference
in the world before he is forcibly removed

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.290
from it and because that is the mission that
Googlers can definitely identify with, please

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.010
join me in welcoming Stan Slap.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.010
[applause]

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.620
&gt;&gt;Stan Slap: All right. How are you doing?

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.220
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: Good.
[audience murmurs in response]

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.500
&gt;&gt;Stan Slap: Good, good. All right. Listen.
Before we even get started here, I know that

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.990
you're here for any number of reasons, but
one of the reasons must be to learn. And there

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.560
are two ways to learn anything. I mean this,
though. There's data and there's experience.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.120
And there's two types of experience. There's
good experience. There's bad experience. And

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.380
even though we all like to claim we're nibbling
from the higher branches by this point in

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.850
our evolution, let's face it. It's most often
the bad experience that finally claims our

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.350
attention, which is why, before we even get
started today, I would like to dedicate our

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:04.420
time together to the one company which in
recent memory has committed the most boneheaded

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.420
act.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.999
An act that is not just so anti-business sense,
it's so anti-common sense that it can only

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:17.599
be interpreted as a noble act, as a selfless
gesture so the rest of us may learn what not

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:23.230
to do and so, grow and prosper in our own
organizations. Now, competition for the dedication-spot

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.880
in this talk has been predictably fierce,
but my company does business in over 70 countries,

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.189
so I thought I'd look globally for the dedication
spot.

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:37.370
And I think I've found the company that is
worthy of that honor. So, I would like to

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.240
dedicate our time together today to Aeroflot,
the Russian airline. [audience chuckles] Has

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:50.269
anybody here ever flown Aeroflot? Great. Has
anybody here ever flown United? Yeah, you've

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.439
flown Aeroflot. Pretty much the same thing.

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:54.439
[laughter]

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:58.659
And by the way, everything I tell you here
today is true. Aeroflot management, in a desperate

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:05.019
bid to cure sagging revenue, has leaped upon
a new consumer campaign which they announced

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:10.599
recently in the business press in Eastern
Europe. And according to Aeroflot, in this

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:16.889
article where they announced it, this campaign
is their first ever, what they call "Smile

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:17.969
Day."

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:24.790
And according to Aeroflot management, on Smile
Day every employee at the airline will be

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:32.180
under orders to quote, "smile unceasingly
at customers for the entire day." It's like.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.180
[laughter]

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.989
And they were asked in this same article,
"Well, what if Smile Day is a success?" And

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:44.620
their official corporate spokesperson responded,
"If Smile Day is a success, we will consider

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.379
implementing it on an annual basis." All right.
[chuckles]

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:49.379
[laughter]

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:53.329
And I thought, "You know, it is exactly this
treatment of effect over cause, of symptom

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:59.579
over sickness that's responsible for the chronic
ills that business faces today." It's not

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:00.989
just Google.

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:07.439
The problems that continue to baffle and bedevil
managers in every company and every industry

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:13.949
in every line of business on every team in
every country are not really new problems.

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:20.010
The biggest problem is that the solutions
are not really new solutions. Now, nowhere

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.160
is that more the case then when it comes to
a subject like leadership, which is what I'm

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.410
gonna talk to you about today.

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:34.130
Now, leadership, [chuckles] that's a big subject.
We could spend a lifetime talking about leadership.

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.250
I don't have a lifetime to spend talking to
you about leadership. I have about 40 minutes.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.320
So, I figured I had a choice. [sniffs] I could
make the 40 minutes seem like a lifetime to

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.640
you.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.950
[laughter]

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:51.950
Or I could focus on what's most important.
Today, I am gonna focus on what's most important.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.790
I guess good news and bad news about this.
The good news is I happen to know a lot about

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:01.790
leadership. My company's leadership solution,
which is called "Bury My Heart at Conference

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:07.250
Room B" is the highest rated management development
process in many of the world's highest rated

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.900
companies.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.760
That took about ten years to build and we
beta tested for another ten years amongst

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:21.700
tens of thousands of managers around the world.
The book version, this thing. This took a

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:27.730
while to write, too. And I wrote it backed
by a 23-person research team, including Pulitzer-winning

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.680
investigative journalists and specialists
in psycho-neurobiology.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.490
So, bottom line is I happen to know a lot
about this particular subject. I can actually

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:45.560
show you exactly how to be a leader. The bad
news is I've got like 40 minutes to do that.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.380
This is like a 40-minute workshop on the principles
of neurosurgery. So, grab those knives and

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:51.380
good luck.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:57.410
I can't possibly explain to you exactly how
to become a leader in 40 minutes. But here's

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:05.450
what I can do. There is more mythology, misdirection,
superstition, and generalized academic babble

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:11.300
about leadership than almost any business
subject. I can bust the most dangerous myths

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.350
once and for all for you.

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:17.340
Right here. Right now. I can give you a little
taste of what leadership would look like in

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:22.320
your own organization if you applied it. I
can tell you once and for all the difference

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.380
between management and leadership, if you
ever really wondered about that. And if I

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.810
can't show you exactly how to become a leader,
I could do the one thing far more important

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:31.810
than that.

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:37.050
I can show you exactly why you should become
a leader, because that is one of the biggest

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:41.700
myths of leadership is that it's a practice.
Leadership is not a practice, not something

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:48.200
else you have to do as a manager. Leadership
is a purpose. It's a motivation.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:53.340
There is no leadership school in history that
can claim history's greatest leaders as alumni.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.430
They all just started somewhere, figured it
out. I can show you what has caused every

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:02.780
iconic leader in history to pull that trigger
on the ignition switch that kick started their

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:03.780
leadership.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:10.331
And I can make it immaculately relevant for
you at Google. And I'm talking to you as managers.

00:07:10.331 --> 00:07:15.310
So, let me just real quick find out. How many
of you in this room are actually managers

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:20.240
with headcount? Raise your delicate, well-manicured
fingers please. [audience chuckles] OK. And

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.639
then, how many of you would classify yourself
more as the managed?

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:26.670
Raise your tough, calloused, working-class
hands please.

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:27.670
[laughter]

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:35.630
Yeah, OK. So, if you're the managed, I'm gonna
show you the greatest secret of managing successfully

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:41.381
as well, which is found in this whole thing.
And this is certainly relevant for the people

00:07:41.381 --> 00:07:46.290
who've chosen to be managers. Don't you start
getting all snarly and cocky in here, going

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:47.500
"heh heh heh."

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.150
Your career could take a sudden wrong turn.
You could become a manager and you're gonna

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:56.020
wish you'd listened to this information. [laughter]
In the meantime, you're still managing something

00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:00.930
at Google. You're managing conceptually yourself.
You're managing part of Google's business.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:05.700
You're managing others. You're managing your
life. So, I think this will still be relevant

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:11.260
to you. Now, let's get to the big myths of
leadership. And the way I'm gonna do that

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.730
is I'm gonna ask and answer some questions
for you. And we'll bust these myths. I'd be

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:18.050
happy to take questions at the end, but let
me get through some of the big ones now for

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.050
you.

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:25.820
The first, probably the biggest is, "Is leadership
important?" Well, let me answer this for you

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:31.520
conclusively. No. We can just stop here, right?
Thank you.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.520
[laughter]

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:37.819
See how much you learn at these things? No.
Leadership is not important. Leadership is

00:08:37.819 --> 00:08:45.921
absolutely meaningless. Now, what leadership
provides, that's very important. You know,

00:08:45.921 --> 00:08:51.860
you can go on Amazon.com as an example. You
can type in "books leadership."

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:56.559
How many titles do you think are available
right now under the subject heading of leadership?

00:08:56.559 --> 00:09:01.020
And I actually did this when I wrote "Bury
My Heart at Conference Room B" and they breed

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:04.660
like rabbits. So, I don't know how many are
there now, but I have an actual number for

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:05.660
you.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:11.321
How many titles do you think are available?
Thousands. Fifty thousand. Keep going.

00:09:11.321 --> 00:09:12.321
[laughter]

00:09:12.321 --> 00:09:15.790
You know what? I'm gonna skip the suspense
'cause I know Googlers are trying to crack

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:19.680
this code for the next hour. Three hundred
and eighty thousand, five hundred and sixty

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:24.629
seven titles. Eighty-four percent of those
books, written in the last fifteen years.

00:09:24.629 --> 00:09:28.850
Ninety-one percent about something called
"business leadership."

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:34.050
You ever wonder where all this incessant babble
in the enterprise about leadership comes from?

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:43.540
It comes from the one thing that any company
wants most from it's managers: emotional commitment.

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:49.040
A manager's emotional commitment is the ultimate
trigger for their discretionary effort.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:55.430
It's worth more than your financial, intellectual,
and physical commitment combined. A manager's

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:59.940
emotional commitment, that's the stuff that
solves problems that are unsolvable. It creates

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:05.910
energy when all the energy has been expended.
And it ignites emotional commitment in others,

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:08.769
like employees and teams and customers.

00:10:08.769 --> 00:10:15.610
Any legendary sustained organizational success
is at the root, the result of a bunch of emotionally

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:21.800
committed managers. And leaders are those
rare human beings in history who have emotional

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:26.360
commitment to a cause and who can inspire
it at-will in other people.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:34.579
Now, any manager in this room joining, any
manager watching this on YouTube, joining

00:10:34.579 --> 00:10:40.920
any manager in the world can appear fully
productive and enthusiastic simply because

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:45.230
you are intellectually, financially, and physically
committed.

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:50.110
But if you've ever witnessed a human being
emotionally committed to a cause, working

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:54.730
like they're being paid a million and they're
not being paid a dime, you know there's a

00:10:54.730 --> 00:11:00.100
difference. You know it's big. It's that difference
a company wants from its managers.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:09.680
Just because it's big doesn't mean it's easy.
The key neurobiological source of emotional

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:14.089
commitment in any human being--this is not
me telling you this--this is your brain telling

00:11:14.089 --> 00:11:18.949
you this. [audience laughs lightly] The key
neurobiological source of emotional commitment

00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:26.160
is your ability to live your own deepest personal
values in whatever relationship or environment

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.160
that you're involved in.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:32.689
Or if you're a manager, that means your relationship
with Google, your environment at work. Now,

00:11:32.689 --> 00:11:37.490
manager may be a great job to have. If you're
a manager, you may be having a great time

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:44.600
doing that job. But embedded in any manager's
job description is the requirement to continually

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:49.980
subordinate or even compromise personal values
in favor of company priorities.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:55.939
Now I'm not saying you're out there committing
heinous acts as part of some Faustian bargain.

00:11:55.939 --> 00:12:00.779
Although, even if you are, listen up. What
I am saying is what the company wants done

00:12:00.779 --> 00:12:06.079
and how it wants it done must regularly take
precedence over your own deep priorities.

00:12:06.079 --> 00:12:11.519
That's what it means to be a manager. You
serve your company first. Well, if you put

00:12:11.519 --> 00:12:18.920
a person in a position like that, they detach
to protect themselves. Now, in a bad company.

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:25.630
Have any of you ever worked in a nasty, toxic,
belly of the beast company? Yeah? OK.

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:31.199
In those kinds of companies, managers make
the conscious choice to detach. Managers in

00:12:31.199 --> 00:12:36.810
those nasty companies, they say to themselves,
"I'm gonna suit up every day for the detachment

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:41.269
factory and leave the best of who I am at
home and hope that it's basically still there

00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:43.869
when I get home to reclaim it."

00:12:43.869 --> 00:12:51.119
But in a good company like this company that
tries to do the right thing for its managers,

00:12:51.119 --> 00:12:57.089
the detachment is even more dangerous because
it can't be easily seen. Because intellectual

00:12:57.089 --> 00:13:03.050
and financial and physical commitment combined
to masquerade as the missing type.

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:07.570
But emotional commitment is different. It's
deeper. It comes from a deeper, different

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:13.810
place. And if this isn't understood and the
ability for managers to sustain this on their

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:19.970
own, isn't really embedded into the organization,
then any hope of emotional commitment is lost.

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:24.579
And lost with it is any hope of real leadership.
So let's talk about real leadership again

00:13:24.579 --> 00:13:31.519
for a minute. If you go back to those 380,567
books on leadership, take a look at them.

00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:35.939
They all pretty much tell you the same thing.
They will tell you that the purpose of leadership

00:13:35.939 --> 00:13:40.139
is to increase shareholder value and team
productivity.

00:13:40.139 --> 00:13:45.170
That is not actually the purpose of leadership.
That has never been the purpose of leadership.

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:51.679
That will never be the purpose of leadership.
The irreducible essence of leadership is that

00:13:51.679 --> 00:13:58.160
leaders are human beings who live their own
deepest values without compromise.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:04.870
And they use those values to make life better
for other people. Now, that's why people become

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:10.509
leaders and that's why people follow leaders.
So the question is, can the people in this

00:14:10.509 --> 00:14:15.709
room, whether you're a manager or not, become
a real leader? Oh yeah.

00:14:15.709 --> 00:14:20.589
Oh yeah, leadership is not some rare genetic
imperative. It's innate in every human being

00:14:20.589 --> 00:14:25.600
and it's damn well innate in you. You just
have to know where to get started. If you

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:30.639
study the chronology of every iconic leader
in history, their leadership all starts in

00:14:30.639 --> 00:14:36.540
pretty much the same place: with their personal
values being put under tremendous pressure.

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:41.129
You wanna know if something's important to
you? Meet somebody trying to take it away.

00:14:41.129 --> 00:14:46.420
Well, that same pressure is on your values
if you're a manager. It's just harder to realize.

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:51.550
Because the pressure on a manager's personal
values arrives gift wrapped. It arrives with

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:53.360
financial reinforcement.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:58.290
It arrives with this sense of self to be gained
by affiliating with the might and magnificence

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:04.769
of the company. Besides, there isn't any company
that actually wants its managers to be leaders.

00:15:04.769 --> 00:15:09.449
Really. Study leadership throughout human
history. Leaders are people who use their

00:15:09.449 --> 00:15:14.540
own values and vision to overthrow the established
order and set everybody free.

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:19.139
What are you? Nuts? This is the last thing
any company wants its managers to be particularly

00:15:19.139 --> 00:15:24.279
interested in, or capable of. The company
just wants managers to do the things that

00:15:24.279 --> 00:15:31.720
leaders do, like model selfless acts of devotion.
And inspire a sullen group of individuals

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:35.499
to make a bloody charge up Competitor's Hill
to capture the fourth quarter flag.

00:15:35.499 --> 00:15:41.050
And what the company really wants from its
managers is emotional commitment. And there's

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:47.480
nothing wrong with that. But listen up. That's
not why you should be a leader. As a manager,

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:54.769
your most important responsibility is to Google.
As a leader, your most important responsibility

00:15:54.769 --> 00:15:56.949
is to yourself.

00:15:56.949 --> 00:16:03.779
You must fulfill your personal responsibility
first. It's far from being a subversive act.

00:16:03.779 --> 00:16:08.200
This is actually the single most supportive
corporate action you could ever take. The

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:14.790
bottom line about leadership is that you will
never really work for your company until you

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:18.220
company really works for you.

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:23.809
And if you think that this is a problem that
somehow has escaped Google, just because Google

00:16:23.809 --> 00:16:31.399
is a great company, which it unquestionably
is, let me give you a little stat. The first

00:16:31.399 --> 00:16:35.889
time we put ten thousand managers through
the "Bury My Heart at Conference Room B" process,

00:16:35.889 --> 00:16:40.989
the full process, we went back and looked
at some data that came out of those sessions.

00:16:40.989 --> 00:16:46.389
And these are ten thousand managers from over
70 countries from many of the world's most

00:16:46.389 --> 00:16:53.170
admired companies from executive to entry
level. And we asked those managers, "Well,

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:56.930
if the source of emotional commitment is living
your deepest personal values, what are your

00:16:56.930 --> 00:17:01.220
deepest personal values? What do you care
most about as people?"

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:05.170
And that's not a test. There's no right or
wrong answers to that question. But there

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:10.420
were certainly some choices made more often
than others. The number one and two values

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:15.510
most often chosen by managers--and we do this
every time we hit another ten thousand--and

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:16.910
it's always the same.

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:22.540
Here's the first ten thousand. Ten thousand
managers. The number one and two values chosen

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:30.120
by those managers as most important. Number
one was family. Number two was integrity.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:35.710
And we asked those same ten thousand managers
across seventy countries from executive to

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:41.820
entry level, and from many of the world's
most admired organizations, "So, what are

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:46.310
the personal values you're most under pressure
to compromise on a regular basis to do your

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:49.450
job successfully?" Watch me now. This goes
very quickly.

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:52.920
[whistles]

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:56.390
[laughter]

00:17:56.390 --> 00:18:01.280
You better file that under big trouble. You
are looking at the equation for emotional

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:09.950
detachment. And since leadership is the organizing
framework for an emotional commitment, that's

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:13.100
why we're talking about leadership. And that
brings us to the next question. "Do you have

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.880
to be born a leader?" No.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:20.080
Nobody is born a leader. You just have to
do the things that leaders do for the reasons

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:26.310
that leaders really do them. Now, the number
one thing that separates a leader from a normal

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:32.670
human being is that a leader really knows
who they are as a human being. I mean, they

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:33.670
really know who they are.

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:39.420
A leader knows themselves so well, they could
put a name on their core values. And most

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:45.550
of us don't really know ourselves that well.
We may be driven by our core values. We may

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:49.830
be driven crazy by not meeting our core values.
It doesn't mean we really know what those

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:50.830
values are.

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:56.250
It doesn't mean that we are making daily decisions
to protect and to promote what's truly most

00:18:56.250 --> 00:19:01.710
important to us. Leaders are different. They
know this about themselves. And because a

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:07.730
leader knows exactly who they are, they know
exactly where they wanna go in the world.

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:13.090
They wanna go to a place where their values
are fully realized. Martin Luther King, Jr.

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:19.470
as a young man discovers pretty early on he's
got core values of what, freedom, spirituality,

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:24.590
equality. So, he knows where he wants to go.
He wants to go to a place where those values

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:25.590
are fully in play.

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:31.150
He calls it, "I Have a Dream." The only problem
is he can't make that dream happen all by

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:38.490
himself. It's too big. He's gotta turn his
values into a compelling cause for other people.

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:43.940
I can tell you, that's where and why leadership
starts. It's right there. Leaders do apparently

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:48.280
selfless things for the world, but at heart,
they're very self-centered people.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:53.450
They're gonna do it for you because they desperately
need you to do something for them. I mean,

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:59.270
if a leader knew who they were and so they
knew where they wanted to go, and they knew

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:05.510
how to get there, they'd just go. They'd send
you a postcard from the Promised Land. "I

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:07.520
have a dream. You're not in it."

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.520
[laughter]

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:15.170
But they need you. And so, if you were a world
leader, your leadership will be taking place

00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:23.510
on the world stage. You are a Google manager,
then your leadership takes place in your organization.

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:27.390
That's where the pool of your potential followers,
the people that are gonna make your values

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:30.810
happen, are gonna come from.

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:36.270
And so, what would it sound like to translate
that concept? Well, I'll give you a little

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:40.650
taste. This isn't the entire equation. Otherwise,
it would've been a pamphlet instead of a book.

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:44.980
But I'll give you a little taste of what it
would sound like. Let's say, like many managers

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:48.480
do, you have family as one of your deepest
personal values.

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:52.740
Now, if you were a leader, you'd have the
kind of self-awareness to understand why.

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:58.130
Why, out of a world of possibilities, you
pick family as one of your core values. So,

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:03.870
you would actually know beyond the literal
definition of family what family gives you

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:06.450
as a concept that makes it so important to
you.

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:11.680
So, let's say you thought about it and said,
"What do I get from my family? I get open,

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:20.180
honest communication. I get unconditional
support. When I need it, I get tough love.

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:25.770
But if I stumble and fall, in my family, they'll
be there to scoop me up and put me back on

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:26.770
my hind legs.

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:32.780
And in my family, I am surrounded by people
who put my welfare ahead of their own. And

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:37.260
they inspire me to do the same for them."
There isn't a righteous feeling in the world

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:42.210
that can touch that. And that's why family
is so important to me. And I'm not gonna do

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:46.940
without that over half waking hours at work.

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:50.580
Well, you'd have to make that very important
to your people. So, you'd have to use that

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:56.360
value to promise them better working conditions.
You'd have to say something like this to your

00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:00.630
people. Of course, you'd also have to prove
it, but you'd have to say something like this

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:04.320
as a first announcement, "Let me tell you
what life is gonna start looking like on this

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.380
team.

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:12.290
Number one, you will never again put your
job and your family into conflict without

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:18.080
giving me the chance to do something about
it. Your job and your family will be strangers

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:23.570
no more. You're doing good, important work
here. As we celebrate that for you, we're

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:27.711
roll that celebration right out to your family,
that people that make it possible for you

00:22:27.711 --> 00:22:30.400
to get in here every day and do that good
work.

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:34.370
And when something great is going on for you
at home, don't you dare think you have to

00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:39.480
leave it locked up at home. You roll it in
here. We'll cheer you on. But, God forbid,

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:44.730
something serious ever goes wrong for you
at home. I want you to know you'll have the

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:47.830
strength and support of this family.

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:52.370
Because we're like family here, too. We're
here together all the time. It's time we started

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:57.990
acting like a family. And I mean the very
best families. This team will have open, honest

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:04.460
communication. This team will have unconditional
support. When we need it, this team will have

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:05.460
tough love.

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:10.740
But under pressure, this team will never turn
on this team. Now, this team will come together

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:16.790
to protect this team. Because that's what
families do. And family is very important

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:24.440
to me." Now, do you think your people are
gonna reject a message like this from you?

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.650
Oh, my God.

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:30.590
Your people are dying for a message like this
from you. They're dying for what leadership

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:36.930
really represents, which is righteous cause
and trust at the highest levels. And all that

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:43.080
Maslow stuff that you probably dozed off about
during management school--significance, belonging,

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:45.820
self-worth, core emotional fulfillment.

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:49.940
If your people had not bought something like
this from you, that just means you're not

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:56.490
selling it. They're dying, dying for this
from you. And leadership is very hard to find

00:23:56.490 --> 00:24:00.500
in the world today. If they can touch at any
place, particularly at a place that they live

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:04.160
in half their waking hours, they're going
to respond to it.

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:08.150
And this brings up the difference between
management and leadership that I promised

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:15.080
you. Here is the basic, short-form difference
between management and leadership. Any management

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:21.600
message that you ever hear, no matter how
expensively and eloquently delivered to you

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:26.961
it is, whether it comes to you on a small
screen in your hand, whether it comes to you

00:24:26.961 --> 00:24:32.130
in the big screen at a Google off-site, whether
there's free clothing involved, whether Google

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:34.020
got the Village People to play together again.

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:39.200
I thought all those guys were dead. Whatever
it is, any management message that you ever

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:46.750
hear is simply an equation that ends only
one way. Equals work harder. That's a management

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:53.300
message. But any leadership message that you
ever hear, any real, authentic leadership

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:56.490
message is also an equation that ends only
way.

00:24:56.490 --> 00:25:05.030
Equals live better. Now, I can tell you what.
If you're a manager, your people are not gonna

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:11.081
work harder unless they are convinced it is
going to allow them to live better. Of course,

00:25:11.081 --> 00:25:18.060
the same goes for you. That's what we're talking
about here. So, will Google reject this?

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:22.590
Well, Google is--. We've put "Bury My Heart
at Conference Room B" into some of the organizations

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:29.080
at Google and it got rave reviews. They didn't
reject it at all. Struggled with it a bit.

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:34.190
But didn't reject it. Will Google, the company,
reject this? No.

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:39.740
Here's, from a company perspective, I can
tell you as an ex-CEO, I didn't realize this

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:45.040
at the time, but from a company perspective
when you're looking at a manager culture,

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:52.440
the biggest issue for a company when it comes
to its managers is protecting against the

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:57.050
constant dilution of energy from its managers.
'Cause if you're a manager, you only have

00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:58.210
so much energy.

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:06.060
And most of that energy is already tapped.
So first of all, just doing the job. That

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:11.520
dial is cranked to ten all the time. Or we
say, "The managers eat from a magic plate.

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:16.540
It doesn't matter how much you swallow, nothing
ever seems to disappear." And so that dial

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:17.540
is--.

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:21.710
All your energy is being used just to do the
job. But doing the job is not the entire job

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:26.460
for a manager. You also have to constantly
incorporate the new and the more in that job.

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:34.020
And the first dial is not gonna turn down
for the second dial. If you have any shreds

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:39.120
of energy left, you're gonna spend it staying
sane on the job while you're trying to do

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:40.570
the first two things.

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:47.350
And so, managers are just tapped out. And
yet, the company still wants you to do more

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:51.750
and more and bigger and bigger and harder
and harder stuff. Where is that energy gonna

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:56.540
come from if those dials never turn down?
Managers are gonna go to fumes.

00:26:56.540 --> 00:27:02.190
That's all they got left. And if a manager
goes to fumes, that kind of energy, you may

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:07.980
seem like a manic, multitasking PDA checking
change agent. But that energy? That's nasty

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:12.690
energy. That energy is killing you at the
same time it's juicing you. It's not the kind

00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:16.180
of energy that is the same as sustained emotional
commitment.

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:22.630
That energy is toxic energy. It's neurobiologically
toxic energy and ultimately becomes cynical

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:29.990
energy. Exhausted energy. There isn't a strategy
or goal that Google can conceive and drop

00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:38.070
onto a platform of that kind of manager energy
that will ever be dependably weight bearing.

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:43.730
So, the question is, is how do you give managers
more energy and take the weight off the enterprise

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:48.220
while you're doing it? Because nobody's got
any more time to figure this out. You have

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:54.260
to shift the energy source to an individual
energy source. A self-sustaining, self-reinforcing

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:55.260
energy source.

00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:59.130
That's what "Bury My Heart at Conference Room
B" is all about, by the way. If you could

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:05.650
turn your job into a mechanism for fulfilling
your deepest personal values, you will protect

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:10.110
that mechanism by making the company even
more successful than it is right now.

00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:14.310
'Cause now, in addition to everything else
Google does for you, it's doing something

00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:18.890
even more important. Whether it realizes it
or not, it would be giving you the opportunity

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:24.180
to understand how to do this. You cannot live
your values without the support of your people.

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:27.980
If your people don't know what those values
are and don't care, you don't have a shot

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:33.410
at this. So, if you turn your values into
better working conditions for your people,

00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:38.150
you're people are gonna protect you. Now,
as a manager, you stop being a replaceable

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:39.150
commodity.

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:43.560
They don't want anything to happen to you
now. So, how are they gonna keep you safe?

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:48.140
Give us the performance objectives. We've
got that. You stay right where you are. That's

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:52.740
why companies who don't have patience as a
corporate value love "Bury My Heart at Conference

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:53.740
Room B."

00:28:53.740 --> 00:29:02.870
And it's this energy that is the biggest issue
for managers. So, let me wrap up this brief

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:11.430
overview. Is that redundant? Brief overview?
Let me wrap up this overview by reframing

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:16.110
this first question. And I already asked this
question on your behalf. Is leadership important?

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:21.870
And I answered it for you based on twenty
plus years of in-depth work on this subject.

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:29.510
No, it is not important. That's not exactly
the right answer. The right answer is yes,

00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:36.780
it is important. It is very important. Why
is leadership important? Because leadership

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:42.480
is the organizing framework for emotional
commitment. And that's critical.

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:46.511
Emotional commitment will do a lot of things
for you if you have to manage people. If you

00:29:46.511 --> 00:29:50.520
have to get results through other people,
this is the best way to do it. People will

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:56.000
follow you as a leader. They will not follow
you as a manager. Nobody is gonna line up

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.330
behind you as a manager except maybe to push
you down the stairs.

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:03.280
But as a leader, they are going to follow
you and they're gonna listen to you and they're

00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.920
gonna have faith in you and they're gonna
grow with you. Those are leadership things.

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:13.440
But there is one other benefit to doing this
that trumps all those things. So, I have a

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:15.390
brief interactive portion here for you.

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:20.440
I'll ask it of all of you, managers can certainly
answer. I don't know where to start the voting,

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:25.060
so I'm gonna just start it very low. I don't
mean to be patronizing to you when I ask you

00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:30.310
this question. Somebody pulled that on me
last week. He said, "I don't mean to be patronizing

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:31.310
to you.

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:36.401
That means when I'm talking down to you."
I said, "I know what patronizing means." So,

00:30:36.401 --> 00:30:40.991
I don't mean to be patronizing to you, which
means when I'm talking down to you. OK? But

00:30:40.991 --> 00:30:44.701
we gotta start the voting somewhere. So, let
me just ask, how many of you in this room

00:30:44.701 --> 00:30:47.050
work 40 or more hours a week?

00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:55.690
Raise your hands. OK. I ask this question
because I put this argument that I just put

00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:59.490
in front of you, in front of managers all
over the world all the time. And I've had

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:04.270
managers all the time say to me, "You're talking
about my personal values? Of course I live

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:05.880
my personal values.

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:11.420
In my personal life. I protect and promote
my personal values, but I'm also a manager.

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:16.300
So, yes. In my personal life, I protect and
promote my personal values. And then every

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:20.450
morning when they clamp the helmet down on
that Hazmat suit that says "Manager" across

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:24.100
the back and I go into the office, I'm all
over the company values."

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:28.950
That's beautiful. That is very inspiring,
but there is one dangerous flaw in this common

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:34.980
management logic. So, most of you work 40
or more hours a week here. How about, anybody

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:42.470
here working 45 or more hours a week? Raise
your hands. I'm not gonna bite you. [audience

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:43.860
murmurs]

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:47.690
That should go likewise. I don't wanna be
bitten for this, all right? This is just the

00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:50.700
way it is. All right. How many of you work
50 hours a week or more, if you netted it

00:31:50.700 --> 00:32:02.059
out, week in, week out? Raise your hands.
OK. Anybody pulling 55 hours a week or more?

00:32:02.059 --> 00:32:07.610
OK. [chuckles] Anybody doing 60 hours a week
or more?

00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:13.010
OK. So, what. Can we say on average it's 50
hours a week, week in, week out? Or is it

00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:19.410
less? Tell me. Let me explain what I mean
by interactive, OK? [chuckles]

00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:20.870
[laughter]

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:24.990
Listen, I'm not gonna hurt you 'cause you're
already hurting yourself. That would be kind

00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:30.930
of the point. So, 50 hours a week? [audience
answers] It's like special home room here.

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:35.720
OK, good. So, 50 hours a week or more. How
about travel time? The time you spend getting

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:39.130
back and forth to work or traveling for work.

00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:44.590
I assume you're not all dazed, feral road
warriors. Is that at least another ten hours

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:49.970
a week that you spend traveling? OK. Now,
thank you. Now, we are at 50 hours a week--uhh,

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:54.360
60 hours a week. You're working 50. You're
traveling ten. How about think time?

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:59.360
The time you're not actually on the job, but
you're thinking about the job? How many hours

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:05.670
a week is that? That's just the rest of the
time, right? Think about this. How many hours

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:10.950
a week do you think you spend not actually
engaged in doing the job, but thinking about

00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:16.650
the job, worrying about the job, obsessing
about the job, talking to somebody outside

00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:21.350
the job about the job, waking up screaming
about the job?

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:22.350
[laughter]

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:28.690
Could that be in a seven-day span? Another
15 hours a week? Easy, right? Now we're at

00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:33.440
75 hours a week. You're working 50. You're
traveling ten. You're thinking about work

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:38.680
15. Well, I'm gonna skip the entire mathematical
formula for you. I'm just gonna give you the

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:39.809
bottom line.

00:33:39.809 --> 00:33:46.960
At a combined 75 hours a week, between work
time, travel time, and think time, each and

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:54.730
every manager in this room and anybody else
who answered that way is spending on average

00:33:54.730 --> 00:34:04.750
more than double your waking hours working
than not working. Welcome to your personal

00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:06.900
life. [audience chuckles]

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:12.960
You think you get these hours back? Death
sends you an email. I know you're Google managers.

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:16.050
You think, "I would just delete that email
from Death without reading it and I will live

00:34:16.050 --> 00:34:22.960
forever." It does not work that way. This
is it. This is it. These are the irretrievable

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:25.320
hours of your personal life.

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:30.120
And no matter how fulfilling and rewarding
financially, intellectually, this job may

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:36.970
be, to not live your deepest personal values
over half your waking hours is a crime. What's

00:34:36.970 --> 00:34:42.720
worse, it's an unnecessary crime. Google is
not deliberately saying to you, "Do not meet

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:44.280
your personal values at work."

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:48.919
I mean, unless one of your personal values
is like, corporate embezzlement or something.

00:34:48.919 --> 00:34:54.990
There's plenty of room for both. Yes, you
have a job and a responsibility as a manager.

00:34:54.990 --> 00:34:59.790
And that is to protect and promote Google's
values and Google's vision for the world.

00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:05.320
Side by side with that responsibility, you
have an opportunity, which is to protect and

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:10.690
promote your own values and your own vision.
And if you do that right, jumping on that

00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:15.610
opportunity will never hurt your responsibility.
In fact, it will make most of your responsibility

00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:17.720
happen for you.

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:27.940
So, why should you become a leader? Because
leadership, if you deconstruct leadership,

00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:32.240
it's all about emotional commitment. If you
deconstruct emotional commitment, it's all

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:37.110
about living your deepest personal values.
Why should you live your deepest personal

00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:39.290
values?

00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:45.080
Well, your deepest personal values are your
very own definition of what life looks like

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:51.990
when you live it exactly the way you want
to. Your values are your very own source of

00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:59.790
safety, of hope, of renewal. Well, why should
you live your deepest personal values at work?

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:06.170
This is an excellent question to ask. If your
attorneys are planning an insanity defense

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:10.700
because you're spending over half your waking
hours here. Because you don't get this time

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:15.670
back. Because this is a corporate organism
you're working in. It's got its own life force

00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:17.320
and its own priorities.

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:22.330
To live it, to make living your deepest personal
values a passive process in an environment

00:36:22.330 --> 00:36:28.670
that's not a benign environment is a very
dangerous thing to do. Because your values

00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:32.930
will ultimately result in your leadership.
And your humanity cannot be self-proclaimed.

00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:38.910
It is only activated when you offer it to
others. Because if you don't know what's true

00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:44.970
for you, everyone else has unusual influence.
If you're not on your own agenda, you're prey

00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:50.270
to everybody else's. Because those ten thousand
managers who said, "Family and integrity are

00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:51.860
very important to me.

00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:57.460
Family and integrity are the things that I
compromise to be successful." They weren't

00:36:57.460 --> 00:37:02.350
saying "family is being compromised because
I don't have work/life balance." They were

00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:08.550
saying family is being compromised because
the dependable support and affection and community

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:13.930
I get from my family, I'm not getting in a
place I spend half my waking hours.

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:18.471
They didn't say integrity is being compromised
because I'm being forced to lie, cheat, and

00:37:18.471 --> 00:37:24.990
steal to make my numbers. They said my integrity
is being compromised because there is a disturbingly

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:29.970
low amount of integrity between who I really
am and who I am at work.

00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:38.320
Now, I don't wanna stand up here acting all
emotionally evolved in front of you. That's

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:44.070
actually a violation of my parole. The whole
thing was taken completely out of context.

00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:54.040
But I can tell you this. I will tell you this.
This is your one and only precious life. Now,

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:57.910
somebody is gonna decide how it's gonna be
lived.

00:37:57.910 --> 00:38:07.310
And that person had better be you. So, is
leadership important? Yes. Leadership is actually

00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:14.083
the most important thing you will ever do.
And let me just wrap this up and then I'm

00:38:14.083 --> 00:38:21.940
happy to take any questions from you. I wanna
wrap this up. I was wondering how I should

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:22.940
end this.

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:30.440
And I'm gonna end it by answering a question
I'm asked all the time. I am regularly asked

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:36.800
this question from the C-suite, or from individual
managers, or employees, but mostly from managers.

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:42.260
The question is, if you had just one recommendation
you could give to any manager in any company

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:47.470
in any position anywhere in the world, you
could only tell them one thing.

00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:52.891
What is the one most urgent recommendation
you would give to any manager? And I love

00:38:52.891 --> 00:38:56.300
it when people turn my life's work into a
game show question, but I've had a chance

00:38:56.300 --> 00:39:03.770
to think about it. I'm gonna leave you with
this today. For yourself, because it's your

00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:05.890
life that's at stake here.

00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:12.010
This time, the time you're spending on the
job, you don't get this time back. Your life

00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:19.550
is happening to you right now. For your family,
because the health your family outside the

00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:26.369
job, depends in large part on the health of
your family inside the job. If you're a manager

00:39:26.369 --> 00:39:31.630
for your people, because it's not easy working
in environments with constant uncertainty

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:32.630
and pressure.

00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:37.290
With regular reminder of how little control
you have over your work life, for someone

00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:45.550
who you only know as "my manager." For your
customers, because people don't trust companies.

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:53.810
They trust people. For the company itself,
because Google is not a technology company.

00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:59.800
Don't ever make that mistake. Google is a
human company selling technology to other

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:06.140
humans. And the pivot point upon which any
strategic success rests is a discretionary

00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:10.960
effort of its human organization. And you
can't sell it outside if you can't sell it

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:13.730
inside.

00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:20.330
And finally, for the world, because let's
face it. Things are very weird out there right

00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:29.040
now. I'm not just talking economically. The
world is a scary, uncertain, shaken place.

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:33.840
And we actually have every indication that
things are gonna get a whole lot weirder before

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:36.870
they get any better.

00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:43.260
Now what is it that any of the good people
gathered here together today in this room

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:49.320
can possibly do about the conditions that
affect the world at large? [laughs briefly]

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:59.320
Not much. Except to extend our own humanity
to the people that we are closest to, including

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:04.730
the people that we see every day, including
our employees and our customers.

00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:15.300
And so for all of those reasons, I urge you,
to be human first and a manager second. OK.

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:16.300
Thank you.

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:17.660
[applause]

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:19.510
Yes.

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:34.931
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: I have a question.
So, if you talk all like your manager and

00:41:34.931 --> 00:41:35.931
leaders. The question is that if your manager
is not a leader, should I look for a leader

00:41:35.931 --> 00:41:36.931
or preferably another manager?

00:41:36.931 --> 00:41:38.110
&gt;&gt;Stan Slap: So if your manager is not, is
very clearly not a leader. Do you wanna get

00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:44.950
up here on film with me? So, an anonymous
question from, it could be anybody in this

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:48.800
whole section, saying, "My manager is not
a leader. What do I do? Do I go looking for

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:53.470
a leader, or do I stay and take my stand right
here?"

00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:59.011
I would say it's a version of the same question
that managers ask about if I can't live with

00:41:59.011 --> 00:42:03.920
my values here, do I leave? I would give you
the same advice. I wouldn't leave for a couple

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:09.190
reasons. First of all, no manager may be any
different for you and this may ultimately

00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:11.320
be the best manager you've ever worked with.

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:18.541
The bigger issue and the bigger solution is
to help your manager learn how to be a leader.

00:42:18.541 --> 00:42:23.470
And I gotta tell you, it's just not something
that you really learn being a manager. The

00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:28.250
biggest challenge, if you're a manager, is
to unlearn the job of being a manager 'cause

00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:30.780
there's so much stupidity in there.

00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:36.070
One of the things that managers learn very
early on--not working at Google necessarily--but

00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:40.890
if they've ever managed anywhere, you learn
as a manager either directly from somebody

00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:46.210
else or it just seeps into your DNA. You learn
that you need to manage.

00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:51.270
The reason that your job exists and the reason
you need to control and watch people is that

00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:55.600
you fundamentally cannot trust the employee
culture to protect the company with its own

00:42:55.600 --> 00:43:02.410
good judgment. So, you have to manage them.
And that's just ridiculous. But you learn

00:43:02.410 --> 00:43:03.410
that sort of thing.

00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:08.119
And I will tell you as well that from your
position, you think about clawing your way

00:43:08.119 --> 00:43:13.240
to the top at Google, you can cling to the
illusion that everything will be figured out

00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:17.440
and fulfilling when you get there. I gotta
tell you, I know a lot of those people from

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:18.490
a lot of companies.

00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:24.000
When you get there and find that things still
don't make sense, and now you're maybe a culture

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.240
of one and you can't admit what doesn't feel
good 'cause you got all the apparent rewards

00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:33.730
of the job. And there's no place else to go.
People jump from the top floors in buildings,

00:43:33.730 --> 00:43:35.150
not the bottom. Have you noticed that?

00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:36.820
[laughter]

00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:42.110
So, I would say it would be a kindness for
you to tell your manager, "Listen. I'm gonna

00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:46.080
make a deal with you on the business. You
wanna get the best out of me? I'm willing

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:53.990
to give it to you. Here's the way to do it.
If for no other reason, if not just for understanding

00:43:53.990 --> 00:44:00.130
what this team is truly capable of in terms
of commitment and loyalty, 'cause you may

00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:05.320
have the wrong idea about that. I can tell
you how to get the best out of me."

00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:09.630
But also, I would make it a values conversation.
This is not soft stuff. This is the stuff

00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:14.950
of hardcore results. Your manager's got values,
too. He may have the same values you do. I'd

00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:19.190
put it in terms of that and say, "Listen.
The way I'm being managed, I have family and

00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:21.580
integrity as a value and here’s what I mean
by that.

00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:26.700
This isn't working for me, like on a human,
this isn't working for me. Tell me your values

00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:31.070
and I'll respect those. I gotta have that
back." I would say you have a better chance

00:44:31.070 --> 00:44:36.631
of actually fixing and helping that person
professionally and personally than if you

00:44:36.631 --> 00:44:40.270
just take off. OK? Any other questions? Yeah.

00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:48.970
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: What are recommendations
that you have for spending time dedicated

00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:50.220
to self-awareness?

00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:55.109
&gt;&gt;Stan Slap: I personally spend no time dedicated
to self-awareness. I wrote the book. That's

00:44:55.109 --> 00:45:02.070
enough. I believe think deep, live shallow.
That's my personal motto for living. I think

00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:07.950
self-awareness is a beautiful thing. Like
I said, there's so many influences on you.

00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:12.460
Anybody trying to sell you anything stands
to profit from you not having a strong sense

00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:16.940
of self. 'Cause again, if you don't know what's
true for you, I've got unusual influence.

00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:22.609
So, I would make it a habit to stay self-aware,
just as a corrective measure to all the influences

00:45:22.609 --> 00:45:23.609
in the world.

00:45:23.609 --> 00:45:28.790
How do you do that? The best way to do it
is to surround yourself with people who know

00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:34.290
what you're trying to do and take some value
out of that. That's why in the book, I put--.

00:45:34.290 --> 00:45:38.540
It's definitely a process for managers, but
there's also process how to adapt it, how

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:41.720
to take it home, how to do it with your partner,
if you have kids.

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:46.840
How to take this with your kids, your community,
however you do this. So, I think there's tremendous

00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:50.960
value in self-awareness. Although, the people
who study it the most avidly are the most

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:54.570
dim, least aware people I've ever met, but
that's just coincidence.

00:45:54.570 --> 00:46:00.350
I think if you stay self-aware by surrounding
yourself with people who understand that you're

00:46:00.350 --> 00:46:06.960
trying to do that and you're holding yourself
to that standard and they find value out of

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:11.970
that, that's the best way. And I would advise
anybody to pick a couple of methods that work

00:46:11.970 --> 00:46:15.350
the best for them and to live a life of intention.

00:46:15.350 --> 00:46:23.830
This is no time, in the world, to not live
a life of intention. Yeah. Congratulations,

00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:24.830
by the way.

00:46:24.830 --> 00:46:26.340
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: [audience member
responds off mic]

00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:27.920
&gt;&gt;Stan Slap: Oh, yeah. I know.

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:32.670
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: So you said there's
some organizations that have gone through

00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:37.750
your program here at Google. And you said
they didn't reject it, but they struggled

00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:43.510
with it. So I'm curious to know, were they
cultural things or were they things we see

00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:44.530
in other organizations--

00:46:44.530 --> 00:46:50.540
&gt;&gt;Stan Slap: That's a good question. Why did
they struggle with it? Some of it was cultural

00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:57.840
and some of it was having to make the case
that the opposite of emotional is not rational.

00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:02.920
The opposite of emotional is detached. So,
don't think about it that--.

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:07.330
Emotion in the human brain is a highly rational
process. It's just capable of producing wonderfully

00:47:07.330 --> 00:47:14.780
irrational responses. So, a lot of it was,
what is this? Is this some soft woo-woo stuff?

00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:20.869
Which clearly it was not. So, some of it was
just a bias of Google, the renowned bias of

00:47:20.869 --> 00:47:23.540
Google, to lean on the intellectual.

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:28.370
And once they understood there was an actual
schematic to this--it's been pretty well documented

00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:35.990
and proven--they relaxed. Part of it was just,
what happens to a manager? It's just a weird--.

00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:41.160
Are you a manager? OK. Well, hopefully I haven't
talked you out it here.

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:46.000
There's just weird stuff that happens to managers,
even in the best companies. Like the thing

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:50.690
I was telling you about earlier. I tell you
that the most difficult, and this my answer

00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:55.360
to your question, the most difficult part
of writing the book was the duality the reader

00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:58.560
as a manager.

00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:02.700
There's just something that happens to managers.
If this was a room full of managers, I could

00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:07.840
take any two of you out and talk to you about
how you wanna live and work and live at work.

00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:12.300
And you'd be pretty sane and sensible about
that, as managers are. If I bring you back

00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:17.150
and put you in a room full of other managers,
some bizarre herd mentality takes over and

00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:19.660
you start legislating against yourself.

00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:24.720
Because the conditions that managers deplore
most about managing, there's no evil brain

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:30.410
in a jar behind a curtain. They were created
and mandated and accepted by managers acting

00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:36.340
as management, the Honor Guard of the Corporate
Organism. And what managers learn is that

00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:42.290
if I set you free to pursue your own values
and your own priorities, maybe you won't prioritize

00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:43.290
the company.

00:48:43.290 --> 00:48:47.869
I mean, what if you have creativity as a value
and you work for me? And I say, "OK, and this

00:48:47.869 --> 00:48:50.780
is what we have to do." And you go, "Yeah,
I love that. It's a values thing. I ain't

00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:55.690
doing it. I'm free to make creativity as a
value. I have health as a value. I'm not working

00:48:55.690 --> 00:48:56.690
like this.

00:48:56.690 --> 00:49:01.380
I have integrity as a value. I'm not representing
this product until it is fully tricked out."

00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:08.710
And so, managers learn to just stop this in
themselves and stop it in others. That's management

00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:15.150
worldwide. So basically, the answer to your
question, there were some fighting against

00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:19.770
the initial bias against something that seemed
soft and stupid.

00:49:19.770 --> 00:49:24.770
When they realized it was not soft and stupid,
the next question was, "Gee, can I really

00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:30.859
sell this to myself? If I've detached, I did
that because I think it's safe to be detached

00:49:30.859 --> 00:49:35.900
from my relationship with the company, with
the people. You're asking me to be unsafe.

00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:37.320
I gotta think about that.

00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:41.369
Can I sell this to my people? Can I still
be a manager and get done what I have to get

00:49:41.369 --> 00:49:46.650
done?" We worked through all that stuff. I
don't think there's any real barrier at Google

00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:52.040
that will prevent this at all 'cause they
really bought into it. But there is a barrier

00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:55.260
from being a manager that is the same the
world over.

00:49:55.260 --> 00:49:57.040
That takes a while. Did I answer your question?

00:49:57.040 --> 00:50:02.440
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: Yeah. And the
next question would be for those of us who

00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:08.990
might not be managers, but worked a lot with
managers across the companies, the selling

00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:15.540
the-, the putting yourself in a place that's
potentially unsafe feeling for you being actually

00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:16.540
beneficial?

00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:18.490
&gt;&gt;Stan Slap: Yes. Yes. No, I mean that's--.
What's that?

00:50:18.490 --> 00:50:19.820
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: So, I think that
the second part of the question is then once

00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:25.940
you've identified that part of the resistance,
is that we're essentially asking people to

00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:38.580
put themselves in a place that's potentially
emotionally unsafe? And once they recognize

00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:56.692
that, then how do we convince them, or do
we try to convince them that that actually

00:50:56.692 --> 00:50:57.692
is beneficial both for them and for the work
that they're trying to get done?

00:50:57.692 --> 00:51:01.240
&gt;&gt;Stan Slap: That's a challenge. It's gonna
take both. And that's why the book is written

00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:06.230
both for--. Every manager has a manager. I
mean, you know who Mother Teresa's boss was?

00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:08.690
Who really her boss,

00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:13.410
the person who did her performance appraisals?
It was the Pope. OK? You think you got problems?

00:51:13.410 --> 00:51:18.590
Your boss just thinks he's the Pope. Her boss
was really the Pope. And so, she had a manager.

00:51:18.590 --> 00:51:23.060
Everybody's got managers. And this is not
gonna work with the manager not being able

00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:27.041
to make it a value and a safe proposition
for you, and you not able to help the manager

00:51:27.041 --> 00:51:28.170
feel that way, too.

00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:33.000
That's what the book is about. It's the right
question. It can be done. We've used it all

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:40.241
over the world. It can be done. Here. It can
be done at Google. OK. Thank you.

00:51:40.241 --> 00:51:43.840
