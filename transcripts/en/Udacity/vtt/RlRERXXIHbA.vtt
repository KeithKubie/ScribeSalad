00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.807
The SyncManager does schedule 
your SyncAdapter jobs

00:00:02.807 --> 00:00:05.400
but they don't have anything to do
with what goes over the wire.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.130
There's no standard 
synchronization protocol.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.720
And while they are
tied to AccountManager,

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.850
they have nothing to do 
with storing account information.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.640
However, they will 
auto retry requests,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
if network conditions are spotty.
