It's a great pleasure to
welcome Franklin Knight

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.160
to the Library of Congress.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.880
He is a professor Emeritus
at John Hopkins University

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.420
and he has written many,
many books on Cuba,

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.880
on Latin America, on Brazil.

The famous lecturer and he is
also on the board of Handbook

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.430

which we owe him a deep depth

of gratitude.

Thank you very much.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.010
It's a pleasure to be here and
I must start with an apology.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.150
When I was invited, I had the
illusion that this would be one

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:19.150
of my traditional lectures on
such a splendid elevating subject.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.910
That is to say it will
be accompanied

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.510
by appropriate samples
all through the delivery.

&gt;&gt; Franklin Knight: Well, that's why
I'm apologizing we couldn't do that.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.120
But maybe we can come
back and arrange something

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.290
at the Christmas party,
[inaudible], something.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.250
[ Inaudible ]

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.250
&gt;&gt; Franklin Knight: What I wanted
to do is very simple and actually

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.330
in the first two slides, this one
and the next, you have a lecture

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.040
so you can, since we
have no samples,

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.340
you know what I'm going to say?

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.540
You can fall asleep if
the chair is comfortable

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.410
or you can leave quietly.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.850
I usually say that, to look at
rum, you look at rum by the numbers

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.370
and in fact number 1 is that
rum is the distilled alcohol

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.480
from the sugar cane.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.830
And 2, there are only two
ways that rum is made.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.100
The first is to make it directly
from the juice of the sugar cane

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.840
which is how you get white
rum, that's mostly done.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.990
Today that method is employed
exclusive by the French

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.510
and presumably by the Guatemalans.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.040
[ Laughter ]

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.710
All the producers of rum
in the world and it goes

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.240
under different names as we'll see
shortly, produce it from molasses

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.760
which is a byproduct
for producing sugar.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.910 position:56%
There are three types of rum despite
what the marketers are trying

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.210
to put in.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.380
There is white rum, 80% of
the rum consumed is white rum

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.570 position:56%
and all rum begins as white rum,
because it's a distilled spirit just

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.320
like any distilled spirit will do.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.920
So when you talk about
white rum, you're talking

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.440
about sugar cane alcohol.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.280
And the reason one never wastes
time talking about that is

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.060
that they're really
no subtle qualities

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.860
in white sugar cane alcohol.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.730
It's stronger or it's weaker and
it blends like all other things.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.920
When I give a lecture on this, we
start and I say don't drink it.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.540
Just put your finger in it,
put it on the tongue so to get

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.610
to know what sugar cane
alcohol really tastes like.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.480
What is more, or what is
preferable for people who like

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.680
to indulge is regular colored
rum called gold rum sometimes.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.760
And that's usually put in
casks, white oak casks and aged

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.390
from 1 to 4, 5 or 6 years.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.370
That's called batch rum.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.190
And that's the second
largest component of rum

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.460
because it's cheaper of course.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:06.840
The third group is what's called
aged rum or anejo or premium rums.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.820
That must be aged a minimum of 6
years, usually 7 or more up to 100

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.650
and it's blended just like whiskey.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.850
So where you get your
qualitative distinction,

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:24.910
mainly is in this third category
of rum, the premium blended rums.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.420
And again, when I go on to
talk about it, I will tell you

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:35.870
that recently, the market has
been assaulted by all sorts

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:41.850
of premium rums claiming to be 20,
30, 40 50 years old and is all made

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:47.000
over a weekend but
you can find that out.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.700
And I'll tell you the secret of
how you find a genuine aged rum

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.990
from one of these weekend rums.

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.970
There are four characteristics
that connoisseurs look

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.830
for in assessing rum
and they're very simple.

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.300
The first is the color, it
should have this nice color

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.570
and I'll come back to
talk about this a little

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.380
and that's why it's
always suspicious

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:15.760
to buy expensive premium rums
which are not in a clear bottle.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.150
You have to establish a reputation
before you can do that such

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.300
as Pampero Aniversario
or Zacapa from Guatemala.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:30.540
Those have the distinction,
well, a Zacapa, we don't know.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.330
I'll talk a little
bit more about that.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.260
But they have the reputation
that the rums are good enough,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.830
that people will believe them
even if they're wrapped and left.

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.710
The second is a bouquet,
that's really very important.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.010
White oak gives a peculiar
bouquet to aged rums.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:53.510
And that can be blended,
complicated and ameliorated

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.780
by whatever special
additive that's put

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.030
in to make the rum suave or gentle.

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.520
In the case of Zacapa, we
know, of course its Sherry.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.090
In the case of something
like Royal Crown

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.190
from Trinidad, its
angostura bitters.

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.920
In the case of Jamaica
Appleton Estates Special,

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.550
a rum of singular distinction, the
rum by which all rums are judged,

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.910
it's all spice and
some other things,

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.210
so there's a secret ingredient.

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:26.310
And the bouquet will always stay
if the rum is aged in white oak

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.010
because that's the
basis of the bouquet.

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:32.250
If it's infused with any sort
of thing, if you open the bottle

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.560
for a short time, the
bouquet disappears

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.170
and you know you have
been defrauded,

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:42.030
not an uncommon experience.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:46.580
The third is the smoothness,
good rums are smooth.

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.990
And a lot of these bouquet
rums because they are forced

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:55.900
over a weekend or so, are not
smooth, they're a little harsh

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.970
and you again will feel that
which is why the sampling

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:04.020
of rums is an important part
of the discussion of rums.

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:08.500
And I'd like to say that the fourth
and final one is equally important.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:12.630 position:56%
There should be no harsh aftertaste.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:15.950
After all, when you open the
bottle you should encourage

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.400
to finish the bottle.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.700
And if it has this kick, you're not
going to be encouraged to do that.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.730
You're going to blend
it with something else.

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:30.220
So let's start at the
very beginning.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.310
How do you make consumable alcohol?

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:35.210
There are three ways.

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:38.520
I'm giving you all these
mathematical things, 1, 2, 3.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.360
The first of course, the
oldest way is fermentation.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.430
You leave most things out in
the sugar cane, it will ferment.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:50.160 position:56%
That's how we got grapes fermenting
and wine became the first distilled,

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:56.270 position:56%
oh sorry alcoholic beverage consumed
widely in all wide growing areas.

00:07:56.270 --> 00:08:01.620
The second is after discovery of
fire is brewing, boiling the stuff,

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:07.810
creates ales, beers,
filthy stuff but good.

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:12.660
And the third, which became
popular in the 12th Century,

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:15.510
actually beginning
in the 13th Century

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:19.900
with the Fourth Crusade
was sugar cane alcohol.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:23.090
Now a lot of books
on rum will tell you

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:26.620
that rum is a West Indian
invention, that's not true.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.040
A lot of other books will
tell you that rum grew

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:33.690
out of the Levantine Mediterranean
out of Lebanon and Syria

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:38.920
and that's partly true but
Marco Polo, in 1224 writes

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:43.640
that he tasted a wine made
from the sugar cane in China.

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:48.430
So we know that since the beaker,
the instrument of distillation is

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:54.040 position:56%
of Chinese origin and that beakers,
9000 years old have been discovered,

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.650
we know that the Chinese were
distilling all sorts of stuff,

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:00.850
mainly rice but also sugar cane.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:05.640
And an aside I will tell you
that the sugar cane comes from

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.800
and I'm going to sort of go
over that part, comes Indonesia,

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.720
domesticated in Indonesia.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:15.350
Once through China, India and
then came to the Middle East.

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:19.780
And in fact as late
as the 15th Century,

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:25.920
in most of the Ottoman Empire,
sugar was called Indian salt.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:31.270
And in fact this is when the
coffee which is a beverage taken

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:35.600
in Arabic countries with
salt became blended with milk

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.640
and Indian salt which is sugar.

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:42.260
You can still get that
confection in Vienna today.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:50.240
So these rums are the basis,
these sugar canes, different types

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.510
of sugar cane are the
basis for distilling rum.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:56.040
Here we have some types
of sugar cane.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:01.140
These are exactly what the
sugar cane looks like and the,

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:06.120
these containers will have the
juice in the old primitive form.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.310
If you go to Madeira, you
will still see some of those.

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:13.630
This is the mill, old rotary mill.

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:19.530
This is an improvement made in the
Middle of 15th Century in Sicily.

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:22.510
So for a long time it was
called the Sicilian Mill,

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:24.690
a double roller or a triple roller.

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:27.420
This is the improved
Americanized version.

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:31.020
That's an American triple roller
made in West Point, New York.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:35.310
Both of these are from the
old Cuban sugar estates,

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:37.400
not working now obviously.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.060
These are the pots.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.800
You can see that they
would boil it in the open

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:46.930
and when the sugar did not
crystalize then you got the raw

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:50.310
material for your distillation
product.

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:54.390
So if you want to call it rum
or [room] as the French call it.

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:55.750
They were the first to do it.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:59.850
Or it could call it as the
Brazilians do, cachaca,

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:02.740
aguardiente de cana or rum.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:06.340
That is a Brazilian cachaca bottle.

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:08.330
Some people would recognize that.

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:11.480
I would love to have the
challenge of drinking that dry.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:15.600
It would be a little
challenging I think.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.390
I retired so I could do
something lectures like these

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:23.120
but the opportunities
have not been frequent.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:27.770
Some of these exclusive
rums can be very expensive.

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:31.450
That's not a very good picture,
but this is from the rum museum

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:36.970
in Port au Spain, Trinidad and
this is a special rum that was made

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:42.910 position:56%
or blended which was sold for almost
a one quarter of million per bottle.

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:47.640
I asked them to let me sample it,
because I have some credentials

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.310
but they wouldn't let me do
it for good reason I suppose.

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:56.430
These are the white oak casks
that white rums are blended in.

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:58.810
And on that display
you can see that most

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:02.170
of the rums are actually
variations of white rums

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:04.210
and that wouldn't make
much distinction.

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:09.350
There is some colored rum there.

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:12.250
But none of this in this
batch would be a premium rum,

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:17.920
that is to say aged over
seven years or so or blended.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:22.410
Although, they did tell me, this is
from Worthy Park Estate, Jamaica,

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:25.370
and they just went into the
rum business a few years ago

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:28.440
which is why most of their
rums is still white rums.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:32.400
This is the major white
rum, they sell Rum-Bar rum.

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:36.780
It's terrible but since rum is a
blend, it doesn't really matter,

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:39.700
you're going to put water
in it or juice in it or milk

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:43.080
in it or coffee or something.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:50.610
But they said by 2018 they will
have colored, gold rum and then

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:54.410
in the 2020s they will
have premium rums.

00:12:54.410 --> 00:13:00.190
So as I mentioned, 80% of all
rums, white rum and earlier

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:04.570 position:56%
in the beginning of rum in the New
World because rum travels with sugar

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:08.730
as I said, I byproduct, it only
became a premium product that is

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:12.620
to say people would specifically
make rum in the 18th Century

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:16.450
and we will come to that, so
that a lot of sugar cane growers

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:20.430
of the 18th Century including the
estates [inaudible] Simon Bolivar

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:23.490
did not make sugar.

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:27.680
There are 5000 acres of
sugar cane made only alcohol,

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:28.980
distilled alcohol.

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:33.060
But it was carried in casks like
these and you can see again,

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:36.220
the relationship to the
whole European distillation,

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:40.340
all distilled spirits tended
to be put in casks like that

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:46.430
after it became popular in the 15th
or late 14 and early 15th Century

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:50.190
and if fact if you do the history
of any type of distilled alcohol,

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:54.530
that's when it becomes
a commercial product.

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:56.810 position:56%
This is the Appleton Estate Special.

00:13:56.810 --> 00:14:00.810
They don't have their
highest brand there

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:03.990
which is the blue label,
a 21 year old.

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:09.890
That's the rum that opened the
store window in 2012 at Harrods,

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:15.020
the only rum displayed
at 300 pounds per bottle.

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.890
I wouldn't buy, but I did taste

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:22.030
and it was very smooth,
absolutely divine.

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:25.100
I've been hinting to one of my
friends that in my retirement

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:27.360
that might be a good
thing to give to me

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:31.910
to keep me indoors in the winter.

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:35.420
So how did rum come
to the New World?

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:42.990
Well, it came in the long
journey from the Mediterranean

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:45.970
through southern Spain
to the Atlantic Islands.

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:49.840
Now, sugar was not an
important product in Europe

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:54.850 position:56%
for the simple reason that sugar was
derived from honey and other types

00:14:54.850 --> 00:15:01.740
of products and was
a minor actually.

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:09.050
It was not a consumer popular
item that's the sort of luxury,

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:11.670
until it got to about Madeira.

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:14.450
And the reason it became
important in Madeira which is one

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:17.920
of the major producers along
with the Canary Islands was

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:22.560
that when the wine industry moved
from the mainland of Portugal

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.570
onto the islands, Madeira decided

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:30.000
because it had the growing
characteristics of Porto,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.640
to ship port wine back to Portugal.

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:37.810
Well the people in Porto
would not agree to this,

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:41.710
so the Madeirans did one up
in them, they simply blended

00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:46.900
with distilled alcohol, called
it Madeira, varied it and it took

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:51.470
to the market with vengeance,
still a good product.

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:55.730
This happens to be one sugar
cane fields which do both sugar

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:57.450
and I'll just go through
them quickly

00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:00.130
because sugar cane
fields look the same.

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:03.150
First was Cuba, the second
was Jamaica, this is Brazil.

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:08.030
What you do get in
variation is that the extent.

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:15.080
For example, it's dying out now
in Cuba but if you go from Jamaica

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:19.120
or if you go from Madeira where
sugar cane estate is all the size

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:23.150
of this room, to Jamaica to
where it's about 3, 400 acres,

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:25.880
to Cuba where it's
about 3, 4000 acres.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:29.150
Then you go to Brazil where
it's about 30, 40,000 acres,

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:31.490 position:56%
you can see the production of scale.

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:35.940
But the big difference today is
that sugar is not as important

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:38.360
as it used to be nor is rum.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:45.600
And so most of the sugar cane
growing is done for making ethanol

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:49.090
which of course goes into blend
with gasoline or to be used

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:52.160
as a substitute for gasoline.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:56.300
So how did rum move from
being a marginal byproduct

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.680
as it were to being mainstream?

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:01.110
Ah, you can blame that
again on the pirates.

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:06.570
They know a good thing when they
find it and they found that out

00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:09.720
between about 1650 and 1720.

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:19.410
The age of piracy and what they
did was to capture when they went

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:25.110
on land, not just bullion,
gold silver, slaves, sugar,

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:29.290
coffee, tobacco, but also rum.

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:34.810
And they didn't resell the rum
in most cases, they consumed it.

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:39.030
Well, about the beginning
of the 18th Century

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:40.730
when we had these large wars

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:45.430
in European countries are
establishing peace beyond the line,

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:51.830
Admiral Edward Vernon, after whom
Washington's estate Mount Vernon is

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:58.270
named was short over ales that
they supplied to their sailors.

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:00.180
And of course, one
of the big problems

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.830
until the 18th Century was how

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:07.300
to neutralize the scurvy
attacks among men

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:08.640
at sea for a very long time.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.160
So they used a lot of things.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:15.180
Mainly they used citric
acid, citric juices.

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:19.230
They even tried unboiled eggs
until they found that some

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:23.940 position:56%
of them were probably not the best
things after several weeks or months

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:28.470
at sea and they hit up on rum.

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:35.140
Well, rum unnoticed that pirates
never seemed to have scurvy

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:40.310
and they always seemed to
be bolder than they should.

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:44.400
So beginning in 1739, during
the War of Jenkins' Ear.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:48.130
He ordered that all sailors
and soldiers on his fleet

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:52.740
and his fleet included at the
time, Laurence Washington,

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:55.340
the oldest sickly brother
of George Washington,

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:58.040
who owned that little estate
that later became Mount Vernon.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:02.440
It wasn't as impressive as
George made it but he owned it.

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.200
And he was very impressed by this.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:08.330
I think not by the behavior of
Vernon, but by the daily ration

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:12.340
of rum, because this is what
Vernon said at the time.

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:16.920
It should be cut with water
but never blended so much

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:21.950
that when taken will
not encourage a rabbit

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:25.000
to bite the head off a bulldog.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.010
So there we get it,
this is the grog.

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:31.720
And it's called grog, old grog
because Vernon always went

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:37.410
around the, his ships
wearing a grogram coat.

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:41.030
So they called him, there
goes old grog and so his order

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:47.580
of ration was called old grog,
it's blended with citric juice,

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:52.970
lime juice and water and we still
make grog today although we boil it

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:57.230
and you put in some spices
and it's a marvelous thing.

00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:58.730
One of the big pioneers

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:02.110
in popularizing it was a
pirate called Henry Morgan,

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:06.240
an indentured worker who came out
to Jamaica and ended up his life

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:10.230
as Lieutenant governor of
Jamaica and had the decency

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:13.910
to die just before his main
spot Port Royal disappeared

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:15.500
in an earthquake.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:19.300
His timing was always impeccable.

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:22.610
Ask the Spaniards about that,
after Drake he is the other one.

00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:24.170
&gt;&gt; Is that the Captain Morgan?

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:28.220
&gt;&gt; That is the Captain Morgan but
the rum unfortunately is terrible.

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:31.330
It's what we call airport rum.

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:35.290
You know, it's the type of
thing that you find in airports

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:39.670
and no serious drinker
takes it seriously.

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:44.950
I have never had more than the
first taste but I've been at this

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:52.350
since my infancy and I'm still
hopeful that I will continue

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:54.630
to being in good shape
based on this.

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:58.120
I want to read through all of
this but what it says is one

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:03.440
in 1735 talking about this
practice that they had found

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:07.920 position:56%
in Cartagena on the Colombian coast.

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:15.200
Where the officers drank distinct
beverages, brandy and wines

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:18.120
and the lower classes
drank a product extracted

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:23.430
from the sugar cane, agua ardiente
de cana which is white rum and also

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:27.730
that he was beginning to say that
it seemed that they benefitted

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:30.420 position:56%
from drinking it at 11:00 every day.

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:32.210
It was good for the appetite.

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:36.700
Well if you're drunk at midday it
must be a good day which is why

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:40.140
when I give these lectures
nobody ever complains

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.840
because by the time
I'm finished they're

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:46.000
in an elevated state of view.

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:53.380
Here we have this sort of marketing
labeling and the competition of rum

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:55.110
which is going for a long time,

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:58.840
this is Havana Club
and you have two left.

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:04.210 position:56%
And the left hand side is the what I
call the authentic Havana Club made

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:08.850
by Cubans and on the right is
Bacardi's Havana Club it used

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:13.560
to own the label for Havana Club,
it lost it or gave it up allowed

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:16.970
to be sold legally
in the United States.

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:22.700
Now there is a recent court ruling
that since President Obama went

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:28.520 position:56%
to Cuba that Cubans made Pernod
Ricard there vendors may sell Havana

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:33.440
Club when the embargo is
dropped in the United States.

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:38.480 position:56%
But Barcadi and Cuban, the Cuban
government and then Cuban government

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:42.590
and Pernod Ricard have been
fighting this case since 1970.

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:45.290
So it's not likely to be
settled in our lifetime.

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:50.820
You have a lot of rums, the
important rums I've talked about,

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:54.950
you know, Barcardi, Pampero
Aniversaro of Barbados,

00:22:54.950 --> 00:23:00.650 position:56%
some of the oldest, continuously
produced rum distillers in the world

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:02.840
or Wray and Nephew of Jamaica.

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.540 position:56%
They respect conventions and labels.

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:07.180
That is to say that
you can actually,

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:11.830 position:56%
because these are legitimate
concerns that will set the standards

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:14.140
and follow the conventions.

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:16.510
But then you have on
the market a lot of.

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:24.920
[ Laughter ]

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.220
Well, [inaudible].

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:29.280
I am sure that some
polishes would say

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.480
that is a locker room type of rum.

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.940
[ Laughter ]

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:36.500 position:56%
But you also get the case of Zacapa.

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:39.580
Now Zacapa is a good rum.

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:43.910
Made [inaudible] and
they used to sell a rum

00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:47.300
which was on the left hand side.

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:51.890
You can read it I think
but it says 23 years old.

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:55.300
And they have a 25 year
old and a 30 year old.

00:23:55.300 --> 00:24:00.770
And I couldn't for the life
of me find what was different

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:04.510
between the 23 year old, the 25
year old and the 30 year old.

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:06.540
I thought it was the same rum.

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:09.110
And somebody, you shouldn't
fire people

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:10.930
when they're doing something wrong.

00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:13.210 position:56%
Somebody was fired from the company,

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:16.550
pointed out that ain't
23 years old at all.

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:19.930
So they were forced in
fact, to retrack the label

00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:22.370
because it violated
the convention of rum.

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:24.620
When you label a rum by years,

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:31.720
it means that that is the
youngest rum in the batch, blended.

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.820
So a 23 year old rum can
have a 50 year old rum,

00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:37.300 position:56%
but it cannot be called 50 year old.

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:39.570
It can only be called
23, the lowest.

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:43.640
And if it has 7, 10, 15 and
20, the same thing goes.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:48.300
So Zacapa cleverly, they have now
taken the wrapper off the bottle

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:49.980
but they call the rum.

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:53.700
You might be able to,
well you can't see there.

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:55.160
We should be able to get that.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:59.870
Solera 23 merely indicating
the technique of production.

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:04.730
Needless to say they put in Sherry
cask, date it 2000 feet so they say

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:09.170
above sea level, I haven't actually
physically gone to the plant

00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:12.930
and they rack it like
Sherry is in the sun.

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:16.680
So you get that nice,
smooth, manifested detective

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:20.360
of the Sherry taste
when you take Zacapa.

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:23.500
Now Zacapa has a 30 year old rum

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:29.070
which I will say is very
smooth and very good.

00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:34.250
So developing for the taste
of rum started from the Navy

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:38.620
and anything sailors do at sea,
they will do worse on land.

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:42.190
So naturally they took their
habits and they had this sort

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:46.610
of substantiation that you know,
Admiral Vernon approves of this.

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:52.670
And by the way, the rum ration
that Vernon started in 1739,

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:59.280
was a standard issue until 1970 in
the British Navy, so it endured.

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:05.820 position:56%
And everyone, including Edward
Long, the famous historian would say

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:09.150
that if Vernon says it's
good, it must be good.

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:10.960
And then the second approval came

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:13.170
from none other than
Benjamin Franklin.

00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:16.080
Never saw anything new
that he didn't like.

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:21.260
And this was new, and this was not
only likeable, it was loveable.

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:23.780 position:56%
And I will go on to give some proof.

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:26.700
Now of course it says
how you have to drink it

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:31.250
and that the latter part it, I'm
trying to go through because I want

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:34.520
to have some questions but
there will be a copy online

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:38.960
so you can easily go back and
read this stuff if you want to.

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:44.040
But what it says is that even
when you drink rum in excess,

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.450
it's good for you and I like that.

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:53.300
Anybody who will make that sort
of decoration is my friend.

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:59.250 position:56%
But rum became really very important
in the early American colonies

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:03.340
or the major American colonies
just before independence,

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:07.930
because it became the second
largest employer of labor.

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:15.900 position:56%
And in fact it generated much of the
wealth of the northeast at the time.

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:21.370
And the consumption in the British
North America was tremendous,

00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:24.330
five times what it
was in British Ailes

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:27.080
where people were easily captured

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:29.510
because they were unsteady
on their feet.

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:36.150
Rum helped in the conquest
of the United States.

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:39.490
And in fact even George
Washington admitted

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:46.680
that when he signed the
Naval Armament Act in 1794

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:49.870
in which he said, there
should also be allowed 1 pint

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:54.210
of distilled spirits per
day or in lieu thereof,

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:58.200
one quart of beer a day per person.

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.280
That's my type of man.

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:03.670
That's what I call hefty drinking.

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:08.270
But look what we have from another
of the fathers of the country,

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:10.350
Thomas Jefferson's wine cellar.

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:14.170
Now you know that Jefferson
was himself a winemaker.

00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:18.050
Curiously enough he lists
none of the Monticello wines

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:21.170
in his wine cellar
which led me to believe

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:24.640
that they didn't meet his
standards having lived in France,

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:26.690
so they were for his friends.

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:33.760
I, I know the idea, I used
to serve my seminar Sherry,

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:37.300
but I wouldn't serve them
the sherry I drank at home.

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:41.080
They had to get something a
little less for their homes.

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:46.090
But 15 bottles of Madeira, 4
bottles of common Lisbon wine,

00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:50.090
54 bottles of cider and 53%

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:54.620
of the wine cellar is 83
bottles of Barbadian rum.

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:57.610
Lawrence as you know and
George also visited Barbados.

00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:01.430
Lawrence spent some time in
Barbados got very fond of Mount Gay

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:05.690
and when he came back, the entire
Virginian aristocracy were drinking

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:08.440
rum, mainly Mount Gay.

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:14.460
Later on, Franklin Delano Roosevelt
who spent some time in Haiti,

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:16.700
came back and served Barbancourt.

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:20.990
Barbancourt is a fine rum but
it's a French rum like Clement.

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:22.290
I'll talk about that.

00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:24.360
It's a different type of
rum if you really like rum.

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:28.280
There's no reason why you can't
like Clement but Barbancourt

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:32.310
and Clement pretend to make
a Cognac and I always say

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:35.900
to my French Italian
friends and Haitian friends,

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:38.900
when I want a Cognac,
I'd buy a Cognac.

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:42.520
When I want a good rum, I'd buy a
good rum and one should not confuse

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:45.160
that but to each its taste.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.460
It's a matter of taste.

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:49.360
So let me run through
a few factoids in rum.

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:52.390
I already mentioned the
high consumption rate here.

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:54.260
In 1770, the population

00:29:54.260 --> 00:30:00.550 position:56%
of 1.7 million British North America
consumed 7.5 million gallons of rum,

00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:03.970
half produced locally, half
imported from the Caribbean.

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:07.950
I ran through the figures
and I figured that 4

00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:11.870
out of every 5 persons were
either women or children.

00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:14.500
Women were doing all the work,
children were supposed to be

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:19.050
in school, yet British North
Americans average 4.2 gallons

00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:21.530
of rum per year.

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:25.630
How did they ever win
the war of independence?

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:29.190
Because they were certainly
more unsteady than the British.

00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:34.070
British consumption at that time
was less than 1 gallon per person.

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:38.980
In 1770, British North America
had 18 sugar refineries,

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:42.820
118 distilleries, 51
in Massachusetts.

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:45.650
No wonder they threw
tea into the sea.

00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:47.590
These guys were unsteady
on their feet.

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:50.390
It was not necessary
of political statement.

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:53.100
It was a physical fact.

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:55.000
So they go.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:01.860
And one by 1740 already, rum was
beginning to be in all the books

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:04.560
of the planters and the Caribbean,

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:09.480
second most important cash
product that they had.

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:14.940
Ward family in 1703 in Barbados
and Wray and Nephew in 1749.

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:19.180
But when we begin to think of rum,
the thing about the early rum,

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:22.310
the 18 Century rum, is
that is mainly white rum

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:25.650
or its rum that's crudely
aged in white oak.

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:28.060
After time they found that
white oak was the only oak

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:33.000
that would give the chemical
reaction that makes rum acceptable.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.930
But it still had a lot
of impurities in it.

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:39.880
And the other thing was that
a lot of the sailors thought

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:43.260
that you could store
rum in lead barrels.

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:48.140
So it was not surprising that
lead poisoning became particularly

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:51.730
serious in the 18th
and 19th Century.

00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:54.930
Then we become with Facundo Bacardi

00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:58.810
who started what we call the
modern age of rum making.

00:31:58.810 --> 00:32:01.030
Bacardi was a Catalan
who came to Cuba

00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:08.010
where his brother ran the
sugar business until 2014,

00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:09.750
sadly destroyed the factory

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:13.950
but until 2014 you could still
see the original Bacardi factory

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:16.640
in Santiago, Cuba.

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:20.210
And what he decided to do
was to experiment with it

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:25.450
to see how you could blend these
aging rums which he started

00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:29.840
and by 1862, he had come on with
a product that was acceptable,

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:34.920
despite the fact that the
more successful he was,

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:38.980
the larger the number of rat
bats flew from the distillery.

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:42.000
So most Cubans call it rat bat
liquor, but it didn't matter

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.080
to the Bacardi family,
because the king liked it

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:50.100
and gave them a gold medal
and they were on their way.

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:52.540
About the same time,
the Clement family

00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:55.070
in Martinique started
the same process.

00:32:55.070 --> 00:33:01.760
And all new rum makers began to do
the same scientific aging blending

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:06.300
of rums and removing more and
more of impurities that came

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:08.880
with the whole process
of sugar making.

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:13.650
So that's how we got all of
these different types of rums.

00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:18.240
The batch rums which are the
ones from about 2 to about 6yrs

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:25.430
and those tend to be common
according to the batch that's made.

00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:27.280
I'll sort of skip these,

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:30.300
because we've talked a
little bit about them.

00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:35.070
And go through to the
traditions of rum and how one,

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:37.560
this is the blue label in
the middle, the 21 year old

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:40.980
as I have said actually last week

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:43.850
for the first time I've had
the pleasure of sampling

00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:47.370
that of Toronto, Canada
because I have good friends

00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:50.840 position:56%
who know my weakness and indulge it.

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:56.200
This is the Harrods window in 2012.

00:33:56.200 --> 00:34:01.300
So here are some sampling
of premium rums.

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:06.370 position:56%
I've already talked about that, said
why I don't talk about white rums

00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:10.190
and all these different, what
is ginger rums and coconut rums

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:13.860
and all these things that
marketers are trying to use

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:17.240
to attract sort of wider audience.

00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:22.630
One of the characteristics of rum
is that it's really very versatile.

00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:28.000
Anything you blend
with rum, rum improves.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.600 position:56%
So it's good at the beginning and
it gets better with whatever you do.

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:37.760 position:56%
And the three ways of drinking it
is if you're going to buy a good rum

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:39.680
and you really want to
know how good it is,

00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:41.430
you really have to have it neat.

00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:46.040
You must have it straight and you
must have it in the sort of Cognac,

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:48.950
the glass with things you can rub.

00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:50.550
It's really very good.

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:53.320
You can drink it at all
seasons of the year.

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:56.100
This is what's so marvelous
about it.

00:34:56.100 --> 00:35:01.710
Straight in the winter, blended in
the summer and somewhere in between

00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:03.340
in the spring and the fall.

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:16.150 position:56%
I won't go into the airport
varieties of rum and we'll now start

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:18.770
about the connoisseurship of rum.

00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:23.810
You look four characteristics,
color, bouquet, smoothness

00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:27.980
and the absence of
a harsh aftertaste.

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:32.570
And the real color, although
you can get a darker rum,

00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:36.070
some people like Gosling's,
Bermudans especially

00:35:36.070 --> 00:35:38.860
which is a very, very dark rum.

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:42.130
But again, Gosling's is not
a sippier rum on its own

00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:46.870
because it's supposed to be
the basis for dark and stormy,

00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:52.380
mixing it with ginger beer which
gives it that really kicking nice,

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:58.130
not a mule kick but a
nice stimulating urge.

00:35:58.130 --> 00:36:04.550
The real color though of good
premium rums should be honey-like,

00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:07.960
that sort of smooth, not
too dark, not too light

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:12.120
and that was again why I said that
if you wrap the bottle you can do

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:16.690
that before you buy the product and
that is an important part of it.

00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:21.710
The bouquet, these lectures
must be given with samples

00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:25.300
because it's important that when
I talk about bouquet you get it.

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:29.690
It is a really unique,
individualistic bouquet.

00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:34.860
Because if you are spending a lot
of time indulging in this habit,

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:39.230
you can from the bouquet
determine some of the rums.

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:47.550
You can, Havana Club for example or
Santiago which is the old Matusalem

00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:52.400
which they lost the label for,
the copyright, trademark for,

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:55.400
is blended with molasses.

00:36:55.400 --> 00:37:00.030
So every 5 years, in the aging
process, they open the cask

00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:04.710
and they infuse the molasses
and they turn it, you rack it.

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:08.430
And so you can in Havana club
detect the molasses and also

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:11.470
in the bouquet, the
molasses comes through.

00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:16.190
And a good premium rum or let
me backtrack and personalize it

00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:19.520
since all alcohol consumption
has a personal date.

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:23.620
Everyone has a favorite beer.

00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:26.420
When I came to this country I
couldn't understand how they could

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:29.100
drink that stuff having
come from a country

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:31.350
that produced really good beer.

00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:35.230
But then I realized, it's
marketing, it's laws.

00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:39.600 position:56%
So we improved the beer where I was.

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:43.560
And it's a question of the
reaction with your palate.

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:46.990
So I might have a favorite and
you might have another favorite

00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:49.590
and we're both right,
it's very good.

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:53.610
But bouquet is really
good test of authenticity

00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:57.370
because if you open a bottle of
rum, one of the characteristics

00:37:57.370 --> 00:37:59.060
of truly aged rum is

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:02.610
that it maintains its
bouquet almost indefinitely,

00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:06.830
almost because it's going to
absorb moisture from the air.

00:38:06.830 --> 00:38:13.720
Meanwhile, artificial rums,
these weekend, one week deals

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:18.550
that are now popping up all
over will lose their bouquet

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:20.500 position:56%
because it's an artificial infusion.

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:25.290
If you put it in, it will come
out and it will fade quickly.

00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:29.040
Some smooth examples, Doorly is
the most popular Barbadian rum

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:31.620
but mine happens to,
my favorite happens

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:35.670
to be Cockspur VSOR,
very special old rum.

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:39.430
It's a rum that's so smooth you
will forget you're drinking it

00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:40.730
or El Dorado.

00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:45.420
There's Havana Club and there's
examples, the one, this is Pompero,

00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:50.770
Centenario, sorry from
Venezuela, really good rum,

00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:57.550
much better than [inaudible]
which started making rum

00:38:57.550 --> 00:39:03.600
in 1996 but calls itself 1796.

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:09.470
Royal Oak has, it used to be
a Venezuela rum but it came

00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:13.200
from Angostura, Venezuela
in the Venezuelan Revolution

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:16.040
of 1898, it moved to Trinidad.

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:18.940
Makes Angostura bitters,
some of you might know it.

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:21.760
And it's one of the
things they put in it.

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:29.000
Two good Venezuelan, Pampero in the
Leather Jacket and Barcelo Brugal

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.590
from the Dominican Republic,
also so really good rums.

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:37.950
There's Cockspur but the very
left is my favorite when I need

00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:42.080
to celebrate or relieve my
depression I'd grab a bottle

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:44.620
of that, very good.

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:48.510
My son and I will usually
retreat or when Barcelona loses.

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:52.080
[ Laughter ]

00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:54.960
Some more of the rums
that you will have.

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:59.520
This is Puerto Rican rum Don Q
on the left, very, very good,

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:02.010 position:56%
hard to get sometimes on the market.

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:06.240
And there is an ordinary
Puerto Rican rum too

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:09.960
which Barrilito 3 stars.

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:12.200
There are a number, I don't
have time to go into the number.

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:15.080
The number of ordinary rums which
have all the characteristics

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:19.230
of premium rums at
about 1/3 of the price.

00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:21.490
This was a display
of Zacapa that ran

00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:25.100
for about 4 months
in the Miami Airport.

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:29.210
I happened to use the
Miami Airport a lot.

00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:31.670
And so, I was responsible for most

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:36.850
of the sampling there
for four months.

00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:39.070
No rough aftertaste.

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:41.700
Good rums invite repetition.

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:46.150
They should go down smoothly,
very, very, smoothly.

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:51.910
And one of the characteristics
is that you cannot get smoothness

00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:58.480
if the alcohol content
is above 86 proof.

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:03.680 position:56%
You'll get some of these 88, 90, 92,
you should be suspicious about that.

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:09.410
The perfect proofage for
suavity is between 80 and 86.

00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:12.100
That means that half of
the proofage is the amount,

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:19.800
the percentage the alcohol is,
so 80 proof rum is 40% alcohol.

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:25.700
I think that if you drink
things that are 120, 160 proof,

00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:27.760
you're committing suicide.

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:30.460
There's no way the liver can
handle that sort of thing.

00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:32.870
But most of the people
who drink that type of rum

00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:36.840
or either alcoholics or
they drink it with water.

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:41.040
Now the other thing is that
rums need no special language

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:42.480
like winemakers.

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:44.810
You know, the taste
of fresh mote hay.

00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:47.820
If you want to taste the
fresh mote hay, go eat hay.

00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:51.240
That's why we never
talk about tasting rums.

00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:53.390
We talk about sampling rums.

00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:57.610
Because you know you go to the wine
market and you bring your cheese

00:41:57.610 --> 00:42:01.230
and you bring your bread and you
get your thing and you swish it

00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:05.910
and you do all this sort of ritual
and then you spit it out, naw,

00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:08.460
that's not for the rum guy.

00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:11.390
You drink and drink
until you hear the click

00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:15.690
and you are oblivious
of what is around you.

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:20.260
Rums are sampled, not tasted.

00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:23.070
So here is a testimony,
I don't know,

00:42:23.070 --> 00:42:25.630
do I have time to yes, to read.

00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:27.010
I don't know if you can read it,

00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:29.680
because you can read
it, I love this.

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:34.250
There are 7,800 labels of
rum in the world at least,

00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:36.590
that's the last time
I looked at the rums.

00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:44.210
Made in 181 countries and this
guy is waxing poetic over one rum

00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:48.700
which came from Anguilla, a tiny
island that produces no sugar

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:50.000
but that's not against it.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.160
Most places that produce
rum do not grow sugar cane,

00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:54.460
so it's not surprising.

00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:59.230
Today, most rum including, I
suspect most of the Caribbean rums,

00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:03.370
a lot of the North American
rums are from alcohol.

00:43:03.370 --> 00:43:08.250
Brazil is a major supplier,
South African, Australia, Vienna.

00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:12.450
All the others tend to buy the
stalk or buy the sugar cane.

00:43:12.450 --> 00:43:14.900
So can I move on?

00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:17.300
Yes, that's what it is.

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:21.520
I hate to tell him because
this is about 4 or 5 years old,

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:25.450
that Pirate is no longer
bottled in Anguilla.

00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:29.360
It's bottled in Vienna,
but it's still a good rum,

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:32.460
still an authentic rum.

00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:36.520
So here I'm just running
through some of the countries

00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:41.430
and again you can go online
when this is up on the Library

00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:44.160
of Congress web and pick your rum.

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:49.830
These are both normal batch rums
which are, but the batch rums here,

00:43:49.830 --> 00:43:52.810
like the Barrilito from
Puerto Rico, 3 stars are rums

00:43:52.810 --> 00:43:55.440
which measure up or Flor de Cana.

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:59.630
The ordinary Flor de Cana
rum is a remarkable rum and

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:02.040
yet it's not a premium rum.

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:08.410
Flor de Cana makes a 12 and
14 year old rum which is well.

00:44:08.410 --> 00:44:13.880
If Christianity gave that
instead of milk and honey,

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:18.730
they would have a lot more
affiliates around the world.

00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:25.130
Here, another list, I just
thought I would give you a choice

00:44:25.130 --> 00:44:26.900
if you want to get it.

00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:35.260
But I don't select or recommend the
best rum and I have said I won't do

00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:37.730
that until somebody
pays me to say that.

00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:39.990
Then you will get my number 1.

00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:43.080
But usually I give a
range of good rums.

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:45.820
If you find a rum that you
like, that's a good rum.

00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:47.410
Buy it and drink it.

00:44:47.410 --> 00:44:51.250
If it has all the qualities as a
premium rum that I have indicated,

00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:53.140
then you're home for good.

00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:56.670
And they can come from
anywhere you want.

00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:59.270
I haven't really got
into the Australian

00:44:59.270 --> 00:45:01.490
and South African rums yet.

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:02.790
I've had a few.

00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:05.850
They're really, really good
or some that I have tasted,

00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:07.350
but I need to get a range of them.

00:45:07.350 --> 00:45:10.990
And then there is a good
bibliography for those of you

00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:17.210
who thought that I was just
speaking from elevated stimulation.

00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:21.210
But I actually did some
reading as well as drinking.

00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:23.010
Thank you very much.

of all I had the pleasure

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:41.200
of sampling rum with Joyce Spence.

I remember it well.

There was doom and gloom from
all quarters of [inaudible]

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:01.050
that appreciated good rum.

00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:04.370

end of a good label.

There are only two female blend,
she has a PhD in chemistry,

so she has the credentials,

most of the other people
are sniffing and snorting.

00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:25.400
Sorry I take that back, no
political reference here please.

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:30.150
But a lot of it is you know,
the father to son tradition

00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:32.220
of declaring that sort of quality.

00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:34.500
Yes. You were going
to say something else.

00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:37.810
&gt;&gt; My question is, even though
well she did give me a nice bottle

00:46:37.810 --> 00:46:40.630
of rum, Ron Diaz or
something like that.

00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:42.800
&gt;&gt; Yes, very special.

House, sampled rum, she said,

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:51.090
never put anything in your rum
except a little coconut water

00:46:51.090 --> 00:46:55.110
or ginger beer but
never a Cuba Libre.

00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:57.060
&gt;&gt; Well, I'll agree with that.

00:46:57.060 --> 00:47:01.090

supposed to be a rust remover.

a mojito, now that's something else.

own recipe for making mojito.

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:20.390
And in Cuba when you know,
I will say to someone,

00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:25.270
this is not very good and say
it's a Cuban thing and then I whip

00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:30.690
out my little nice
special mojito recipe.

00:47:30.690 --> 00:47:35.310
They say, el sabe, el sabe, he
knows, he knows and they want it.

00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:36.610
&gt;&gt; Yep, mm-hm.

00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:38.770
&gt;&gt; With all that good
wonderful rum in Jamaica,

00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:41.950
why do people prefer the
Wray and Nephew white rum?

00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:43.320
It's in everybody's house.

00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:45.920
&gt;&gt; Yeah but that's true
everywhere that rum is consumed,

00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:47.650
as I mentioned, 80% of the rum.

00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:50.190
Look at Australia, white
rum is the rum consumed.

00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:53.660
And I think mainly because a little
bit is the addictive quality.

00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:58.230
They're not drinking it for
the qualities we are finding

00:47:58.230 --> 00:48:01.760 position:56%
of batch rums and premium rums,
they're drinking it for the alcohol.

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:04.970
It's like smoking cigarettes
for the nicotine

00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:07.670
and so some of them will blend it.

00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:10.420
But you know, with white rum
you can only get it stronger

00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:12.680
or weaker, there's no subtlety.

00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:17.580 position:56%
What develops in the aging is
subtlety in the batch ordinary rums,

00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:22.400
mostly in the premium rums because
something new is introduced.

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:25.380
In fact, they're even now
making some sort of bourbon

00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:30.340
and putting Sherry in
it to make it gentle.

00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:31.640
Yes.

00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:33.870
&gt;&gt; Could you tell me
a little bit about rum

00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:36.160
and temperance in this country?

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:37.890
Because rum seems to
have been singled

00:48:37.890 --> 00:48:41.140
out [inaudible] than other drinks.

00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:43.800
&gt;&gt; Probably because, yes
it was called Kill Devil

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:45.350
from the 16th Century.

00:48:45.350 --> 00:48:47.780
Richard Ligon writes about it.

00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:53.520
And it was the most popular drink
in the United States until 1913,

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:57.160
so that all the things that
we now identify with bourbon

00:48:57.160 --> 00:49:00.690
or White Lightning
or Southern Comfort

00:49:00.690 --> 00:49:02.820
for example was made with rum.

00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:09.010
And since rum was the most
popular distilled alcohol consumed,

00:49:09.010 --> 00:49:10.310
it got the fire.

00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:16.900
Now in 1913, between 1913 and 1930
when prohibition was repealed,

00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:23.370
a lot of underground
operations took flight

00:49:23.370 --> 00:49:25.510
and rum never recovered after that.

00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:29.330
First of all, American bourbon
whiskey developed, White Lightning

00:49:29.330 --> 00:49:33.680
and all these poisonous stuff
that they, to which we owe NASCAR

00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:36.010
and other types of things.

00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:37.310
[ Inaudible ]

00:49:37.310 --> 00:49:41.050
Which advertised itself a
long time, a scotch whiskey.

00:49:41.050 --> 00:49:45.210
It was made in the Bahamas in
Bermuda, never came from Scotland,

00:49:45.210 --> 00:49:49.010
never had nothing Scottish
in it at all or later

00:49:49.010 --> 00:49:53.900
on we get whiskeys made
in Panama and so on.

00:49:53.900 --> 00:50:00.280
But the temperance movement
really did affect rum

00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:03.090
but not alcohol consumption.

00:50:03.090 --> 00:50:06.360
So beers came up, although
they tried you know

00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:09.150
for a number of years
until recently.

00:50:09.150 --> 00:50:13.560
In a lot of states you couldn't
have beers which were stronger

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:16.910 position:56%
than 4% alcohol, 3% was the average.

00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:20.940
You couldn't have wines which
were more than 11% alcohol.

00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:23.780
Today wines are up to 17% alcohol.

00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:27.330
They've been creeping up
and beers up to 8% alcohol,

00:50:27.330 --> 00:50:30.490
but a good beer is usually
up to usually about 6%.

00:50:30.490 --> 00:50:31.790
Yeah, yes.

00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:34.170
&gt;&gt; I have a question that kind
of follows up on this earlier,

00:50:34.170 --> 00:50:37.150
a question about what
the locals drink.

00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:38.450
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:41.200
&gt;&gt; And what the cheap stuff is.

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:43.910
So, my parents, probably
about 4 years ago used

00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:45.840
to go to Bermuda on vacation.

00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:50.180 position:56%
It was a time when I think Gosling's
was even on the market in the US.

00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:51.480
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay.

00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:52.780
I was just going to
say Gosling's has been

00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:55.020
around for a long time
yes, in Bermuda, yes.

00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:58.240
Dark and stormy, yeah, mm-hm.

00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:02.160
&gt;&gt; Just ordinary folks
drank in large quantities.

00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:03.460
&gt;&gt; Oh yes.

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:05.950
&gt;&gt; But on side of white
rum it's not the stuff

00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:08.040
that comes straight
out of the still.

00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:12.040
But I'm kind of suspecting based
on what you're saying today

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:16.340
that it's not dark, because
it's been aged in wood,

00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:19.250
it's dark because something
has been added into it?

00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:20.550
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's caramel.

00:51:20.550 --> 00:51:21.850
It's burnt sugar.

00:51:21.850 --> 00:51:23.150
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:27.320
&gt;&gt; In Gosling's and it's aged not
necessarily, especially Gosling's,

00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:29.820
not necessarily in oak
cask because you're putting

00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:32.260 position:56%
in the caramel to give it the color.

00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:36.010
You can put in plastic and steel.

00:51:36.010 --> 00:51:39.200
The same way that you know,

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:45.090
in Argentina until the 1990s
they aged their red wines.

00:51:45.090 --> 00:51:47.750
Then of course when the
Chileans told them you know,

00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:52.810
put in oak cask is
better, they caught on.

00:51:52.810 --> 00:51:59.640
But you know, I think the rum
that the buccaneers and pirates

00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:01.740
and others were drinking
was white rum.

00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:07.700
It was ac -- Only accidently
that they found that putting it,

00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:12.110
aging it which was
accidental too improved it.

00:52:12.110 --> 00:52:15.420
And the casks they had were
thrown away casks from wines

00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:17.980
or ales or things like that.

00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:21.660
And as I said, several of
them paid the price for using.

00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:27.500
Yes, the improper containers.

00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:30.790
&gt;&gt; So is this practice of
adding in stuff like caramel,

00:52:30.790 --> 00:52:33.760
is that what you're referring
to as the weekend aging.

00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:37.220
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well it's, yes and in
fact there's a movement trying

00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:40.230
to legitimize it saying
that you shouldn't be

00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:45.040
against caramel coloring because
it is, the caramel is the sugar

00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:46.940 position:56%
and sugar comes from the sugar cane.

00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:48.240
But of course you can get caramel

00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:49.940
for all sorts of other
things as well.

00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:53.010
But more and more they're
just coloring it artificially.

00:52:53.010 --> 00:52:55.420
And they, if you can
infuse it with items

00:52:55.420 --> 00:52:58.050
of certain things you
can trick the palate

00:52:58.050 --> 00:53:01.430
into believing it's actually
the same chemical things.

00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:03.880 position:56%
But it breaks down almost invariably

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:07.940
when you artificially constitute
the color and the bouquet

00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:10.160
and things, they just fall out.

00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:11.600
&gt;&gt; Hm, thank you.

00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:12.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:16.290
&gt;&gt; What is the richest
rum to other drinks

00:53:16.290 --> 00:53:19.520
that are distilled
sugar, like [inaudible]?

00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:21.060
&gt;&gt; Well there's lots
of other [inaudible],

00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:24.470
there's sugar in alcohol
versus fruit alcohol.

00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:27.160
So, but the basic alcohol
is the same whether it's

00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:32.640
from the sugar cane or apples or
grain or whatever else they do.

00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:37.070
When I was a teenager, we tried to
make, I went to boarding school.

00:53:37.070 --> 00:53:40.220
We tried to make alcohol in
the chemistry lab from chips,

00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:41.900
not knowing it was very poisonous.

00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:46.790
Luckily it blew up
before we could sample it.

00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:48.090
So we were saved.

00:53:48.090 --> 00:53:50.230
Later we learned that was a
very dangerous thing to do

00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:56.020 position:56%
because had we succeeded and we were
close to it, it would be lethal,

00:53:56.020 --> 00:54:01.890
because it's not ethanol
alcohol which is the type

00:54:01.890 --> 00:54:04.440
of alcohol which is consumable.

00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:07.340
Yes. Yes.

00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:10.300
&gt;&gt; I'm not a drinker from.

00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:11.600
&gt;&gt; A pity.

00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:12.900
&gt;&gt; I know.

00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:14.200
&gt;&gt; But I have a weak head.

00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:20.920
To get a good rum, how much would
it cost in the United States?

00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:24.860
&gt;&gt; Oh there's a great wine shop
on Wisconsin Ave and Elm Street

00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:27.590 position:56%
and you can get a rum there for $20.

00:54:27.590 --> 00:54:30.090
You can get a good
premium rum for $30.

00:54:30.090 --> 00:54:33.600
Now they have a lot
for 50 and so on.

00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:35.770
But no, you can get
a good ordinary rum.

00:54:35.770 --> 00:54:41.210
You look for Barrilito [inaudible]
or you look for Flor de Cana.

00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:46.470
I think they have both and I think
you're talking 18 to $22 for that

00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:48.670
and it's marvelous and smooth.

00:54:48.670 --> 00:54:56.050
It has all the characteristics I
talk about at 1/3 of the price.

00:54:56.050 --> 00:54:57.350
That's it.

00:54:57.350 --> 00:55:01.530
I thank you for your
attention and again I apologize

00:55:01.530 --> 00:55:04.510

my word for it.
