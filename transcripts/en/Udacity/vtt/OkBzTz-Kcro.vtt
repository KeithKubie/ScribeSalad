00:00:00.251 --> 00:00:02.252
And so you've been at NVIDIA for 4 years?

00:00:02.252 --> 00:00:03.916
Yeah, just over 4 years.

00:00:03.916 --> 00:00:06.337
And you have had kind of an interesting path to get there.

00:00:06.337 --> 00:00:08.380
So tell us a little bit about your background.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.782
So my background is actually not computing.

00:00:10.782 --> 00:00:14.269
I believe I've never had a computing class in my life,

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:16.976
which is not necessarily a claim to fame,

00:00:16.976 --> 00:00:20.270
but my background is actually fluid mechanics and plasma physics.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:27.003
So from engineering days it turned out that you can't do physics without computing.

00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:32.711
When I graduated in '96, the whole world was already moving towards that--

00:00:32.711 --> 00:00:35.446
computing and science connected.

00:00:35.446 --> 00:00:39.177
But I was young and it seemed much more interesting to go and write computer games,

00:00:39.177 --> 00:00:40.995
so I went and wrote computer games for a while,

00:00:40.995 --> 00:00:44.085
went and worked for the military in high-performance computing,

00:00:44.085 --> 00:00:48.085
went to work for a bunch of start-ups, and somehow meandered my way around to NVIDIA.
