10 Unforgivable Plot Holes In Marvel Movies
As entertaining as comic book movies are,

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.960
one thing they have classically lacked over
the years is airtight storytelling.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.640
The action is usually exciting, the special
effects are often state-of-the-art, and the

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.930
visuals are usually a colourful aesthetic
treat – but all of that becomes moot if

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.270
the plot sucks.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.520
The Marvel Cinematic Universe has attempted
to buck the trend of poor plots in the genre.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.050
Movies like Iron Man, Captain America: The
Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.000
were great productions by any standards – but
that doesn’t mean the franchise hasn’t

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.930
suffered from some glaring plot holes.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.990
For clarity, plot holes are logical inconsistencies
within a story.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.880
They can include things like inexplicable
or impossible events occurring, or events

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.200
that contradict earlier events in the storyline
– and you might be surprised at just how

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.160
many there have been in the MCU.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.079
Here are 10 unforgivable plot holes in Marvel
movies.

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.430
Captain America Vs The Red Skull
In 2011’s Captain America: The First Avenger,

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.440
there’s a sequence of events that results
in an outcome that was frankly incredibly

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.619
implausible.

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.210
Cap storms Red Skull’s HYDRA base alone
and ends up getting captured.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.430
He’s taken to a room in the base where he
meets the Nazi supervillain, and Cap’s friends

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.750
happen to burst through the window to save
him.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.850
This scenario relied on way too many assumptions.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.389
How did Cap know he’d be captured and not
killed?

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:25.939
That base was huge - how did he know the room
he’d be taken to would be the one his friends

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:27.459
were going to burst into?

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:30.709
How did he know the glass they smashed in
order to enter wasn’t bulletproof?

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:33.950
It’s all far too convenient to be taken
seriously.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.430
The Bifrost Problem
In 2011’s Thor movie, it was Loki’s plan

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.579
to open the Bifrost – the bridge connecting
Asgard to the rest of the Nine Realms around

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.799
the universe – and use its energies to destroy
the realm of Jotunheim to prove himself worthy

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:49.670
of ruling Asgard to Odin.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.520
In order to prevent him from doing that, Thor
destroyed the Bifrost, which resulted in him

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.420
being trapped on Asgard away from Jane Foster
– his Earth-based lover.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.179
Thor was devastated as a result, and yet in
2012’s The Avengers he arrived on Earth

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:06.539
as soon as he felt he was needed there, with
a half-baked explanation about Odin using

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:11.980
dark energy to send him back.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.880
If it was that easy, why was he so devastated
in the first place?

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.069
And why didn’t he just ask Odin to send
him back to Jane earlier?

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.840
Everyone Knows Where Everyone Else Is Going
In 2012’s The Avengers, everyone seemed

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.019
to have an uncanny knack of “just knowing”
where other individuals were heading, simply

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.290
because it suited the plot – but it really
made no sense.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.239
For instance, Tony Stark assumed that Loki
wanted to be seen by the masses conquering

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:42.650
Earth – describing him as wanting a monument
with his name plastered on it – and he immediately

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.770
knew that meant he’d set up camp at Stark
Tower.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:46.770
How?!

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.700
There are literally thousands of buildings
on planet Earth that would have provided Loki

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.930
with what he needed.

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.200
Moreover, how the heck did Bruce Banner know
EXACTLY where to find his fellow Avengers

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.189
in the HUGE city of New York?

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:01.080
Seriously, this kind of thing was far too
prevalent in The Avengers.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.689
Bruce Banner’s Anger
The degree over which Bruce Banner has control

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:09.401
over his anger and his transformations into
the Hulk is something that really needs to

00:03:09.401 --> 00:03:10.401
be clarified.

00:03:10.401 --> 00:03:14.110
In 2012’s The Avengers, the trauma caused
by an attack on the S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.329
Helicarrier triggered an involuntary transformation,
but Banner later proclaimed that he was “always

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.300
angry” and therefore had total control over
his transformations.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:28.000
Then, in 2015’s Avengers: Age of Ultron,
the Scarlet Witch was able to trigger an involuntary

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.910
transformation that even made the Hulk get
into a fight with his good friend Tony Stark

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:32.910
AKA Iron Man.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.269
Granted, this transformation was triggered
by the mysterious powers of the aforementioned

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.980
Maximoff twin, but it still suggests that
Banner isn’t quite as in control of his

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.890
body as a major plot point in The Avengers
would have us believe.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.670
The Fall of the Chitauri
At the end of 2012's The Avengers, Iron Man

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.000
single-handly defeats the invading Chitauri
army by diverting a nuclear missile towards

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.439
their mothership.

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:58.049
Every last one of them drops down dead when
the ship is destroyed.

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.049
How?

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:02.680
Prior to the nuking, there was absolutely
no evidence of the Chitauri operating under

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.230
a hive mind and they weren't cybernetic beings,
so there's no reason that the destruction

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.409
of a ship should have resulted in their deaths.

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:15.159
It just seemed like far too convenient a method
of ensuring they were all accounted for.

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:20.450
Tony Stark and Extremis
2013's Iron Man 3 ended with Tony Stark having

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.910
learned everything there was to know about
Aldrich Killian's Extremis formula.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.450
As a result, he not only stabilised it in
order to cure Pepper Potts of its effects,

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.600
he also used it to enable surgeons to remove
shrapnel and the arc reactor from his chest

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.650
without killing him.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.990
And yet he hasn't used it since.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.990
Why?

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.100
A stabilised Extremis could be used to save
lives and regrow limbs.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.940
Stark had the intelligence to make it into
an extremely useful applied tool, but he decided

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.170
to bury it in the archives?

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.590
That's far too hard to believe - especially
given that Stark and his friends are in the

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.390
dangerous business of superheroics.

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:02.310
Everlasting 80s Technology
It’s not a stretch to call Star-Lord’s

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.810
Walkman a major plot point in 2014’s Guardians
of the Galaxy.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.190
It’s extremely important to the heroic outlaw.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.070
It keeps him going and is his only real remaining
connection to his late mother and his home

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.540
planet of Earth – but how the hell is it
still working?

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.080
Chris Pratt’s character left Earth 26 years
prior to the events of the movie and, unless

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.320
there are AA batteries in space, that Walkman
should have died long ago – and that’s

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.850
without even mentioning the general wear and
tear on both the device itself and the tape

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:31.090
inside it, as well as the fact that Star-Lord
often finds himself in the kind of dangerous

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.390
situations that would see it taking a regular
beating.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:41.400
English: The Universal Language
It isn't only the Marvel Cinematic Universe

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.480
in which this inexplicably happens, but it's
still something that should bug you.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.200
Planet Earth alone consists of around 6,500
spoken languages - and yet we're expected

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.450
to believe that the majority of the rest of
the universe conveniently speaks perfect English?

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:59.530
2014's Guardians of the Galaxy revealed that
Xandarians, Kree, Zehoberei, Centaurians,

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:04.520
Luphomoids, Krylorians, space racoons, and
even the Mad Titan Thanos are just some of

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:11.130
the beings in the MCU that are fluent English
speakers.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.830
How is that remotely possible?

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:15.960
Avengers Assemble!

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.280
(But only when it suits them)
Ever since the assembling of the Avengers

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.590
in their 2012 movie, questions have been asked
about why any of the team's individual members

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.930
have had to deal with villain problems on
their own.

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.030
Iron Man, Thor and Captain America have all
had their issues - with Aldrich Killian and

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:35.900
his Extremis army, Malekith and the Dark Elves,
and the Winter Soldier and HYDRA respectively

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.120
- so why didn't their heroic teammates offer
some assistance?

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.450
In a world where the Avengers (and even S.H.I.E.L.D.)
make it their business to turn up wherever

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:46.120
there's major trouble brewing, it's hard to
believe that Thor had to deal with what was

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.870
essentially another alien invasion on his
own, or that the three Helicarriers that were

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:54.060
targeting thousands of people considered to
be threats to HYDRA were only opposed by Captain

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.110
America.

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:01.470
Captain America’s Shield
Captain America’s shield is awesome – of

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:02.800
that there is no doubt.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.910
But it’s also one gigantic plot hole.

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.870
It seems to pick and choose when it works
depending on the situation.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.710
For instance, it will easily absorb the impact
of the mighty Thor’s Mjolnir and will deflect

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:16.210
Tesseract-powered energy weapons effortlessly,
but when the Winter Soldier throws a grenade

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:20.120
and Cap holds up his shield to absorb the
impact, he gets brutally launched from an

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.000
interstate to the underpass below.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.810
And when Cap uses it as a projectile, it also
seems to pick and choose what it will bounce

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:27.850
off and what it will wedge itself into.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:32.120
And let’s not get into the fact that it
blocks every single bullet or projectile fired

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.830
at Cap, even when 90% of his body is totally
exposed.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:39.280
Thanks for watching our list of 10 unforgivable
plot holes in Marvel movies.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.560
Did these plot holes bug you?

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.020
Did we leave any major examples out?
