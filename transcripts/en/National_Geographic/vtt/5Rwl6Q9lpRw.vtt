00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.867
ETHAN: Your fingers
freeze up and get cold.

00:00:02.867 --> 00:00:06.500
And they feel like you've got
a glove on even when you don't.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.400
It becomes almost impossible
to do some of the things

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.433
you've got to do.

00:00:09.433 --> 00:00:12.567
I'm handling metal
with bare hands.

00:00:12.567 --> 00:00:13.500
MAN 1: Put it in your mouth.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.467
And then it warms up.

00:00:16.467 --> 00:00:17.533
Is that a trick?

00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:18.800
Yeah.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.333
Well, I don't really
want to lose the nuts

00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:23.734
and washers in the
snow, so I've just

00:00:23.734 --> 00:00:25.100
been putting them in my mouth.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.133
But they're a bit cold, so
I've been ripping bits of skin

00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.700
off my tongue with them.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.400
Whoa!

00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:37.467
Oh, that one's really cold.

00:00:37.467 --> 00:00:39.300
[music playing]

00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:43.333
Cool.

00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:44.367
Shall we put it up?

00:00:44.367 --> 00:00:45.600
CHRISTIAN: Yes.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.600
[grunting with effort]

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.900
MAN 1: Easy, now!

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.867
CHRISTIAN: Yup, it's heavy.

00:00:49.867 --> 00:00:51.233
Hopefully this
weather station will

00:00:51.233 --> 00:00:53.700
become a part of
helping us understand

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.734
what's going on here.

00:00:54.734 --> 00:00:56.100
Once we get a few
storms through,

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.133
hopefully it'll give
us some good data.

00:01:02.467 --> 00:01:04.133
There it is!

00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:04.934
Woo-hoo!

00:01:04.934 --> 00:01:06.800
[plane zooming]

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.166
WOMAN 1: Woo!

00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:12.333
CHRISTIAN: It's a huge
relief to be done setting up.

00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:15.233
Now we have our base
camp for future seasons.

00:01:15.233 --> 00:01:17.734
We've figured out
what we needed to.

00:01:17.734 --> 00:01:19.533
Everything worked the
way it should have.

00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:22.033
We showed that, you know,
the Ross Ice Shelf program

00:01:22.033 --> 00:01:23.233
works really, really well.

00:01:23.233 --> 00:01:25.734
We have scientists from
all different disciplines

00:01:25.734 --> 00:01:27.000
all coming together.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.367
Whatever we're going to
discover, it's going to be new.

00:01:28.367 --> 00:01:29.467
And it's going to
be interesting.

00:01:29.467 --> 00:01:31.266
[snowmobile zooming]

00:01:35.734 --> 00:01:36.600
MAN 2: We need muscles!

00:01:39.867 --> 00:01:41.166
MAN 3: OK, good.

00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:42.700
Get that shovel!

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.033
MAN 1: So we're going
to stage some stuff

00:01:44.033 --> 00:01:46.033
here for the following season.

00:01:46.033 --> 00:01:49.433
So we've left 50-odd
drums of fuel over there.

00:01:49.433 --> 00:01:52.200
Next year, we'll be coming
straight back out to this side.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.667
And we'll have kind of the basis
of the camp already set up.

00:01:56.667 --> 00:02:00.567
Here's poo, some
of our food waste,

00:02:00.567 --> 00:02:02.166
recycling, and
our general waste.

00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:04.467
We'll get rid of a
fair bit of that.

00:02:04.467 --> 00:02:05.500
Pees!

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.633
Lovely.

00:02:06.633 --> 00:02:09.467
[grunting with effort]
[laughing] Your favorite

00:02:09.467 --> 00:02:11.033
part of your job, I bet.

00:02:11.033 --> 00:02:13.367
The Scott Base, they
can only process one

00:02:13.367 --> 00:02:15.300
of those pee barrels every day.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.834
So we'll go home with 34.

00:02:16.834 --> 00:02:19.800
So we wanted to get as many as
we can back to Scott Base now

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.200
to start that process.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.333
It's going to take a month to
get rid of our pees from here.

00:02:24.333 --> 00:02:25.166
We don't need snacks.

00:02:25.166 --> 00:02:26.233
How long's the flight?

00:02:26.233 --> 00:02:27.467
An hour?

00:02:27.467 --> 00:02:29.767
Yeah, an hour.

00:02:29.767 --> 00:02:32.200
MAN 1: Basically, it will
take away four of our people,

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.934
leaving us with a
little small crew

00:02:33.934 --> 00:02:35.467
to begin the return journey.

00:02:41.233 --> 00:02:42.867
WOMAN 2: What is this
luxury accommodation?

00:02:42.867 --> 00:02:43.800
MAN 1: I know.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.500
All-- all this
space on our feet.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.433
WOMAN 2: Those rookies!

00:02:48.433 --> 00:02:50.066
MAN 4: Momma, I'm coming home!

00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:50.967
[laughter]

00:02:51.867 --> 00:02:54.200
