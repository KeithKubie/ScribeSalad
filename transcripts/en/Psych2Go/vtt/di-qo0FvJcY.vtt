Oh

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.529
I once asked a seemingly confident man
what his biggest insecurity or fear was

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.960
to my surprise he answered falling in
love right now

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.529
he said he feared love because his
number-one priority was to maintain a

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.599
concentrated mentality focused to better
himself academically career-wise and

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.340
altogether you may say this is an excuse
to not fall in love but new research

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.290
indicates that this man's reasoning
might actually be accurate a study was

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.829
conducted by researcher Hank Van
Steenburgen along with colleagues from

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.510
leading University and the University of
Maryland on 43 participants who were in

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.190
new relationships meaning six months or
less they were asked to perform specific

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.800
tasks such as separating relevant and
irrelevant information the results the

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.949
participants ability to concentrate and
form tasks were not present Steenburgen

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.909
shared in his study high levels of
passionate love of individuals in the

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.450
early stage of a romantic relationship
are associated with reduced cognitive

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.610
control also adding it could be that the
obsessive nature of passionate love

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.830
imposes important constants on
performing well in tasks that require

all-consuming state we're in where we

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:17.610
justify letting work friends
responsibilities even ourselves slide so

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.190

lose your concentration you may think

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.710
