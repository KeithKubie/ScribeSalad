00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.548
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:54.757 --> 00:00:55.840
MAURICE SCHWEITZER: Great.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.590
Thanks.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.656
Thanks for coming.

00:00:58.656 --> 00:00:59.620
I'm Maurice Schweitzer.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.536
And I'll speak for a
little bit, and then I'll

00:01:01.536 --> 00:01:03.520
turn it over to Adam.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.160
I'm gonna say a few
words about our book,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.420
and some of the concepts in it.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.000
I want to think
about Thanksgiving,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.083
and I want to think about
what Thanksgiving means,

00:01:14.083 --> 00:01:21.530
and what it feels like, and the
things around Thanksgiving that

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.150
give us some insight into
cooperation and competition.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.300
Our book "Friend and Foe"
is about this duality

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.710
where we're both cooperating
and competing with people.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.950
And Thanksgiving is this
quintessentially cooperative

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:33.450
holiday.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.860
We get together with family.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.620
We celebrate the
history of cooperation.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.120
And if there's
something else that's

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.840
funny about Thanksgiving,
along with Thanksgiving,

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.640
we've now come to
associate Thanksgiving

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.410
with the start of the holiday
season, where we often

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.030
see great sales that
start that evening,

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.110
or very early morning
of the next day.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.140
So we go from Thanksgiving,
often having this meal.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.750
And depending on where
you live, or how you shop,

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.300
people often go from
dinner to the mall.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.180
And I'll tell you about
one mall experience

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.270
that happened in 2008.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:18.790
Since 2008, we'll see
people gather at a store.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.860
The story I want to tell
you about is about Walmart

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.150
in 2008 in White
Marsh, where there

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.150
was a sale that was happening
at 5:00 in the morning.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.710
And people had gathered
outside that store

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.080
to get discounted prices on
things like TVs and so on.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.040
And there were so many
people, that the staff

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.471
called the police to try
to help control this crowd.

00:02:40.471 --> 00:02:41.970
The police had shown
up, but weren't

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.300
able to actually do very much.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.200
The crowd had posted a sign that
read, blitz line starts here.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.317
And they started chanting
tear the doors down.

00:02:53.317 --> 00:02:54.400
They're chanting this way.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.970
The employees of the
Walmart formed a human chain

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.300
to try to control the crowd.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.820
The crowd rushed in.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.990
They literally took the doors
off the hinges as they came in.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.770
They ended up trampling people.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.590
And Damour here ended up
getting trampled to death.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.610
Somebody who had just
celebrated Thanksgiving

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.804
ended up being the
victim of this mob.

00:03:18.804 --> 00:03:20.220
What we want to
think about is how

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.630
we shift from cooperation
and competition and back,

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.350
and how we find our balance
as we cooperate and compete.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.050
So our book it talks
about cooperation.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.750
So you think about
parents raising an infant.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.680
They're cooperating at this
intimate, incredible level.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.620
And even as they're the
quintessential cooperators,

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.790
they're also competing,
often in that same domain,

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.720
for things like who
gets to sleep in,

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.120
who changes the diaper.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.540
We're often cooperating
and competing, even

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.470
with the people very,
very, very close to us.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.720
Now it's not just parents.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.910
You think about siblings.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.480
What could be better
than brotherly love?

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.960
But also sort of
quintessentially,

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.160
we have sibling rivalry.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.410
That is sometimes, the
people very close to us

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.970
are also ones with whom
we most intensely compete.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.940
And we might compete for things
like financial resources,

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.919
but also things like
anything that's scarce,

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:18.550
like parental
attention, and so on.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.410
And there's a very
special relationship

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.930
that I'll come back
to, and that's twins.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.500
And for twins, this idea of
cooperation and competition

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.210
starts quite early.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.950
For twins, it starts
before they're born.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.720
Actually, in the womb, they're
both cooperating and competing

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.010
for resources.

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.300
In fact, we were
talking recently,

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.570
and somebody told us about when
they're watching the twins,

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.510
one of the twins was
kicking the other one.

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.500
You sort of see that the
competition start really early.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.220
Now, at work, we
need to collaborate.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.520
And so one of our
challenges is to figure out,

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.880
how do things like
share knowledge,

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.480
collaborate as a group.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.950
So we're collaborating,
but at the same time,

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.250
once or as we're going
through that, we also

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.300
need to balance competition.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.490
Who's going to get credit?

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.290
Who's going to get promoted?

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.080
Who's going to get a raise?

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.410
So we're both
collaborating and competing

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.580
in order to find our balance.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.390
So essential theme
of our book is

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.300
that we're cooperating and
competing all the time, often

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.040
with the same people.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.787
And we need to find our
balance as we do this.

00:05:28.787 --> 00:05:30.370
And so what we'll
do is we'll take you

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.230
through a couple of ideas
about the constructs

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.660
that we consider that shift
us between cooperation

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.440
and competition and back.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.560
So we're looking to
find our balance.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.610
We could cooperate too much.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.090
We might make ourselves too
vulnerable to exploitation.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.330
We could try somebody
too much, and end up

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.520
getting burned by it.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.104
But if we compete
too much, we're

00:05:53.104 --> 00:05:54.520
going to miss out
on opportunities

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.070
to collaborate,
and expand the pie,

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.886
and end up moving
a team forward.

00:05:59.886 --> 00:06:01.260
But if we find
the right balance,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.130
we'll end up doing
the very best.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:06.690
Here's the first idea.

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.700
When we think about
comparison, so

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.640
if we think about things like,
do you make a good salary?

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.411
Do you need to
update your kitchen?

00:06:14.411 --> 00:06:15.410
Do you drive a nice car?

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.520
Is my workspace adequate?

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.170
How are my kids doing?

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:23.760
All of those
judgments are really

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.700
hard to assess in the abstract.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.560
And instead, we make
these relative judgements.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.570
So as we're looking for
comparisons, as our mind

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.500
almost instinctively
races to comparisons,

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.750
there's some individual
differences that some of us

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:39.315
do this more than others.

00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:41.190
But we're constantly
scanning our environment

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:43.370
to figure out, hey,
how am I doing?

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.260
How are my kids doing?

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.190
What do I need?

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:48.570
And we make these comparisons.

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:49.660
We might check Facebook.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.860
We might ask other people.

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.770
We might try to
figure out what's

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:59.050
going on to the other
people's kids around us.

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:01.510
So it could be that our
kids are playing soccer,

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:06.801
and they're young, nobody keeps
score, except for the parents.

00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:08.050
The parents are keeping score.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.760
They know who scored the goals.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.260
They know which team is winning.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.180
And so here, we're
instinctively hard wired

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.890
to make these comparisons.

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:20.270
Larry Bird and Magic
Johnson, for example,

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:22.390
had a very special
competitive relationship.

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:25.370
The special
relationship is rivalry.

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.890
When we have rivals, it's
a really intense form

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:29.810
of competition.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:31.762
And here, Larry
Bird talks about,

00:07:31.762 --> 00:07:33.470
"The first thing I
would do every morning

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:36.330
was look at the box scores."

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.970
He wanted to see what
Magic did, and that to

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:41.480
him was the most
important thing.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.230
Now, here's what's
good about comparisons.

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.990
Comparisons can be
powerfully motivating.

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:47.890
We see something.

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:50.080
We're comparing ourselves
with somebody else.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.880
And we're motivated
by that, and that

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.540
can be really constructive.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.960
So there's a very healthy
component to this.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.720
So here's the good
in comparisons.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:02.190
It increases motivation,
can boost performance,

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.590
and if we can harness
cooperation in the right way,

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:07.090
it can be very good.

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:10.750
But there's some problems
with comparisons also.

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.790
And comparisons can make
us not only more motivated,

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:16.810
but can make us
perfectly miserable.

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:18.800
And I suggest that these
are really hard-wired.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.260
And I'll show you a short video
about how hard-wired they are.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:26.560
This is a study that Frans de
Waal did with Capuchin monkeys.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.430
These monkeys are
really quite clever,

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:33.450
and he taught them how to use
stones as a type of money.

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:35.400
So they would use these stones.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.740
They'd hand them to the
experimenter, and in exchange

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:39.425
get some reward.

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:43.620
Now here's what
we're going to see.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.030
We're going to see a video
of two Capuchin monkeys side

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:47.770
by side.

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:48.870
They both have stones.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:51.080
They're going to hand the
stone to the experimenter,

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.010
and they're going
to get something.

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:57.320
In one cage, one monkey's
going to get cucumbers.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.330
And you can do
this with monkeys,

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:00.570
and they'll do this all day.

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:02.640
They like to eat cucumbers.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.660
It's easy enough to
hand the stones over,

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.170
and they'll keep
getting these cucumbers.

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:08.760
The experiment he
did, however, he

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.350
put another monkey in the
cage next to that monkey.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:16.720
And that other monkey, when they
give the stone, got a grape.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.230
Now, the grape's much
better than a cucumber.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:20.887
And you'll see what happens.

00:09:20.887 --> 00:09:21.590
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:22.590
-She gives a rock to us.

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:24.600
That's the task.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.900
And you give her a piece
of cucumber, and she eats.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.566
The other one needs
to give a rock to us.

00:09:29.566 --> 00:09:31.906
And that's what she does.

00:09:31.906 --> 00:09:35.189
And she gets a grape.

00:09:35.189 --> 00:09:37.161
And see, the other
one sees that.

00:09:37.161 --> 00:09:40.612
And she gives a rock to
us and gets a cucumber.

00:09:44.556 --> 00:09:48.007
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:48.007 --> 00:09:49.944
[END PLAYBACK]

00:09:49.944 --> 00:09:51.360
MAURICE SCHWEITZER:
And so what it

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:55.970
suggests is that is a
stone worth a cucumber?

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:59.330
Well, it is until somebody
else is getting a grape.

00:09:59.330 --> 00:09:59.830
OK?

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:02.800
So there you see, we could be
very happy with our situation,

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:03.830
our station in life.

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:05.470
We could be happy
with our salary

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:07.820
until we find somebody
else is getting more,

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:12.600
and that contrast can make
us perfectly miserable.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:17.550
So here, what's difficult
about comparisons

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.660
is they can make us miserable.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:21.720
They can increase
resentment and spite.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.970
And we need to find our balance.

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:28.290
And one way we do that is
to differentiate ourselves.

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:31.000
And the classic differentiation
is among siblings.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.020
So I talked about
siblings before.

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.810
Often, siblings will have
very similar interests,

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:37.310
but sometimes the
comparisons become

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:41.120
so aversive and grating that we
find ourselves differentiating

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.050
ourselves.

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:46.540
So one sibling might be
really great at school.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:47.460
Great at math.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:50.380
The other one's like, oh
well, I'm really an athlete,

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:51.590
or I'm the artist.

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:54.210
And we find ourselves
differentiating ourselves.

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:57.950
The most intense comparisons
happen with twins.

00:10:57.950 --> 00:10:59.940
And there have been a
number of twin studies

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:02.780
to really disentangle
the differences

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:07.710
between genetic and social
influences on how we develop.

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:10.530
And one really interesting
thing about these twin studies

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:12.680
is that you sometimes
see twins that

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:13.955
have been separated at birth.

00:11:13.955 --> 00:11:16.400
And they grow up in completely
different environments.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:21.150
And they end up with
shockingly similar interests.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:23.950
Whereas often growing up, they
might have similar interests,

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:26.350
but they end up diverging.

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:29.400
And here you find cases
where, yes, people sort of

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.130
balance this sort of
motivation, resentment,

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:34.480
and find their balance,
you end applying things

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.625
like these twins,
separated at birth.

00:11:36.625 --> 00:11:38.500
They grew up in completely
separate families,

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:41.500
different religions,
different upbringings.

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:44.350
But they ended up having
identical interests.

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:46.560
They're both 100% into fitness.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.825
And in fact, both of them
own bodybuilding gyms.

00:11:49.825 --> 00:11:51.700
And when they reconnected
in their 40's, they

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:55.220
were shocked at how
similar they actually were.

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:55.720
All right.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.770
I'm going to turn it
over to Adam to continue.

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:01.475
ADAM GALINSKY: So I'll just,
as of one sort of a transition,

00:12:01.475 --> 00:12:03.130
I'm a twin myself.

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:06.320
And my twin beat the shit
out of me in the womb.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:10.290
And when we came out, he
was 50% larger than I was.

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:13.170
And when I was 12 years
old, I ran a 10K race

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:15.870
in 46 minutes, which is,
I think, pretty good.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:18.100
My brother ran it in under 44.

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:20.900
And so by the time I was 13,
I was no longer a runner,

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.450
but I was now a wrestler.

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:25.030
So you can see how you
can change those things.

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:28.800
What I want to turn to next is
another core topic of something

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.790
that we naturally
compare ourselves to.

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:33.780
When we think about, what
do other people have,

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.404
we often think about
this one dimension

00:12:35.404 --> 00:12:36.890
that really matters a lot.

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:38.340
And that's power.

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.280
And one of the key
ideas that we develop

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:43.010
in this book-- and Maurice
and I have been doing research

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:47.060
on power and social
hierarchy for over 15 years,

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:51.070
almost 20 years now-- is power
is a structural variable.

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:51.570
Right?

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:54.114
When someone has power,
technically what that means

00:12:54.114 --> 00:12:55.655
is they control an
important resource

00:12:55.655 --> 00:12:58.880
that other people want, or
they have a higher level

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.410
of authority than other people.

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:02.530
They can reward and
punish other people.

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:07.290
And that changes us in
some dramatic and intense

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:09.920
physiological and
neurological ways.

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.300
But the key insight
that we develop

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:15.910
is that structural level
of power, why it matters,

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:19.090
is because it creates a
psychological sense of power.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.380
And what really matters
more than anything else

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:23.090
is the psychological
sense of power.

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:24.548
Now, I want to just
tel you briefly

00:13:24.548 --> 00:13:25.880
about a former student of mine.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.270
She got her PhD at Kellogg.

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:29.407
Got a job talking at
Harvard Business School.

00:13:29.407 --> 00:13:30.990
And what happens
there is you come in,

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:33.630
and you do a 90 minute
presentation to the faculty,

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:37.430
and they have one job, which
is to try to tear you down.

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:38.630
So they ask questions.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:40.790
They try to find logical flaws.

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:42.930
They try to catch
your discrepancies

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:44.100
or inconsistencies.

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.975
And she had a horrible
experience at Harvard,

00:13:45.975 --> 00:13:48.589
and felt really
deflated and devastated.

00:13:48.589 --> 00:13:50.630
A couple weeks later, she
got another job talking

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:51.879
at London Business School.

00:13:51.879 --> 00:13:53.170
She really wanted to go London.

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:54.070
She had family there.

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:56.280
It was very exciting for her.

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:58.100
And before her 90
minute presentation,

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:00.557
they gave an opportunity to
spend some time by herself.

00:14:00.557 --> 00:14:02.390
And she said, you know
what I'm going to do,

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:04.556
is I'm going to actually
use some of Adam's research

00:14:04.556 --> 00:14:05.570
and see if it helps me.

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:10.400
And she sat down for 15 minutes,
and she wrote a little essay

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.150
about a time when she had power.

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:14.750
She really thought about this
experience when she had power,

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:16.750
and she went into the
London Business Interview,

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:19.890
and was in complete
control of the whole room.

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:21.280
She was answering questions.

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.810
She was building off ideas.

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:24.094
And she got the job.

00:14:24.094 --> 00:14:25.760
She's tenured at
London Business School.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.130
She's very happy there.

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:30.040
And so we tried to
say, well, can we

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.530
take Jillian's
experience and test this?

00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:34.360
So what we did is
we went to France.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.750
And there, people were
applying to business schools.

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:39.680
And what they had set up was a
mock interview system for them,

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.780
where they could go in
and have a mock interview

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.610
and get that experience.

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:45.879
Now what they do is the
judges tell them at the end

00:14:45.879 --> 00:14:47.670
whether they would've
accepted them or not.

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:49.380
So they get some
feedback about that,

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:50.672
and they get some coaching too.

00:14:50.672 --> 00:14:52.255
And we did a little
experiment, but we

00:14:52.255 --> 00:14:54.520
didn't tell the judges we
were doing an experiment.

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.550
So they had no idea.

00:14:56.550 --> 00:15:00.324
What we did is we randomly
asked a third of the people

00:15:00.324 --> 00:15:02.490
to think about a time when
they had high power, just

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:03.500
like Jillian.

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.625
We had third of the people
think about nothing.

00:15:05.625 --> 00:15:07.416
And then we had a third
of the people think

00:15:07.416 --> 00:15:08.660
about a time when
they had low power.

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:09.160
Right?

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.790
Sort of, would that have a
negative psychological sense

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:12.430
on them?

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:14.980
And what you can see in this
data is a remarkable effect.

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:17.770
The judges were told, on
average, to accept about 50%.

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:20.070
So say either you're in
or you're out about 50%

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:20.786
of the time.

00:15:20.786 --> 00:15:22.660
And we can see here in
the control condition,

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.020
that's exactly what they did.

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:26.090
But look what happened
when people would simply

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:29.740
thought about experience they
had in which they lacked power.

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:32.300
Their interview
performance plummeted.

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.730
And now look what happened
in the high power condition.

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:36.550
It rose up.

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:38.464
And what this research
shows, and what

00:15:38.464 --> 00:15:40.380
studies that we've done
over the last 10 years

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:42.781
is that there's all this good
in this psychological sense

00:15:42.781 --> 00:15:43.280
of power.

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.220
It increases confidence.

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.060
It increases optimism.

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:50.140
One of the researches done by a
professor at Berkeley out here

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:53.720
showed that when you
give someone power,

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.250
their cortisol levels go down.

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:56.166
Now, what is cortisol?

00:15:56.166 --> 00:15:57.110
It's a stress hormone.

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:58.470
So you feel less stress.

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:00.470
Other researchers have
looked at brain activity.

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:02.000
What gets active in the brain?

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.490
What's the approach and
agentic centers of the brain

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:06.340
get activated when
you have power.

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:08.230
So there's all
this good in power.

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:10.870
It makes the
impossible possible.

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:12.980
However, I want to do
another little experiment

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.360
with everyone in this room.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.160
What I want you to
do is I want you

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.368
to hold up your dominant
hand with your index finger,

00:16:17.368 --> 00:16:18.800
just like this.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:19.920
So everyone do this.

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.240
And I want you, as
quickly as possible,

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:25.180
to draw a capital letter
E on your forehead

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:26.760
with your index finger.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.060
Capital letter, forehead.

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.530
OK, good.

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:32.250
Now, it turns out
there's two ways

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:34.380
that you can draw this
cap letter E. We did

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.890
a little experiment like this.

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:39.170
One of the ways you can
draw the capital letter E

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:41.460
is like Maurice.

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:43.590
This is what we call
an other-oriented E.

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:47.110
This is the correct E.
The only reason to do an E

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:49.040
is so it looks like
an E to other people.

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.530
Now, some of you, like
this gentleman right here,

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:53.635
drew what we would
call a backwards E,

00:16:53.635 --> 00:16:56.560
or a self-focused E. It
looks beautiful to me,

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.417
but it's backwards
to other people.

00:16:58.417 --> 00:16:59.500
Now, why does this matter?

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:00.874
Well, we did a
little experiment.

00:17:00.874 --> 00:17:03.610
We brought undergraduates
from Northwestern University

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:06.052
to experiment, and we
took one person and said,

00:17:06.052 --> 00:17:07.510
you're in the high
power condition.

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:09.839
That means you get to
control important resources.

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:12.310
You get to decide side
what another person gets.

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:13.940
And we told someone
else, you're going

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:16.000
to be in the low power
subordinate position.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.170
Someone else is going to
determine your rewards

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:19.682
and what you get.

00:17:19.682 --> 00:17:21.390
And before they did
an activity together,

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:22.792
we separated them
in other rooms,

00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:24.500
and one of the things
we asked them to do

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.530
is draw a capital letter
E on the forehead.

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:27.750
And look what we found.

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:29.530
In the low power
condition, almost no one

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:32.080
drew a self-focused E. It
was hovering around 10%.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.205
But look what happened in
the high power condition.

00:17:34.205 --> 00:17:36.140
It tripled.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:40.247
Over 30% percent of people
drew a self-focused E.

00:17:40.247 --> 00:17:41.330
So what does that tell us?

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:43.050
It tells us something
really important.

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:45.840
Power reduces
perspective-taking.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.120
And in fact, I just told you
about those brain studies

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:52.120
which show that power activates
the agentic parts of brain.

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:55.200
It turns out it takes away this
other part of the brain called

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.240
mentalizing network,
how we learn

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.274
to understand other people.

00:17:59.274 --> 00:18:00.940
So what we need to
do is we need to find

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:04.320
the right balance between
confidence, the good in power,

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:09.190
and take away that self-focus,
so we end up with confidence

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:10.440
and other-focus.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.230
And I like to give a
metaphor of driving a car.

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:17.160
And now, how do you get from
San Francisco to Mountain View?

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.200
Well, you need gas.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.900
You need acceleration.

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.760
But if you drive that
car without a steering

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:24.940
wheel-- not a Google self-driven
car, but a real person--

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:27.560
then you would crash into
things along the way.

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.160
And so, we need
[INAUDIBLE] we need

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.060
to have acceleration, the
confidence, and a really

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:33.200
good steering wheel.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.130
So we need gas and
a steering wheel.

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:37.317
And one of the ways
that we need to do this

00:18:37.317 --> 00:18:39.400
is to understand something
that Maurice and I talk

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.680
about, which is
really important,

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:44.630
the power amplification effect.

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:46.260
What is the power
amplification affect?

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:51.450
Well, power when you whisper,
it can be heard like a shout.

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:53.850
Now, I'll tell you just one
very quick experience I had.

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:56.320
I was an assistant
professor at Kellogg,

00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:01.040
which means I have some power
over PhD doctoral students.

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.635
But I have less power than the
full-chaired professors who

00:19:03.635 --> 00:19:05.307
will vote on my tenure one day.

00:19:05.307 --> 00:19:07.140
And one day, I saw a
doctoral student, Gail,

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:08.910
and I said, hey, Gail,
can you come by my office

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:10.130
at 3 o'clock this afternoon.

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:11.964
I need to talk to
you about something.

00:19:11.964 --> 00:19:14.310
Now, Gail walked into
my office like this.

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:16.420
She was crouched
down, she was wary,

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:18.252
she looked really
concerned, and she's

00:19:18.252 --> 00:19:19.460
like, well, what do you want?

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:21.293
And I was like, it was
something so trivial,

00:19:21.293 --> 00:19:22.790
I can't even
remember what it was.

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:25.060
And then she looked at me
sternly and said, never

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:26.365
do that again.

00:19:26.365 --> 00:19:27.620
I was like, do what?

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:30.390
She said, never tell me you
need to talk to me, because it

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:31.900
scared the hell out of me.

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.066
It's like, I was thinking,
did I do something wrong?

00:19:34.066 --> 00:19:34.880
Is he mad at me?

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:35.939
And I was like, OK, Gail?

00:19:35.939 --> 00:19:37.230
Maybe Gail's a little neurotic.

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:37.490
You know?

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:38.865
And I didn't think
much about it.

00:19:38.865 --> 00:19:41.900
And then the next day, I
get an email from my chair.

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:44.020
And it says, hey, Adam,
can you come by office.

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:45.590
I really need to talk
to you this afternoon.

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:46.964
And then I walked
into her office

00:19:46.964 --> 00:19:49.980
just like this, like, oh my god,
what's going on, what did I do?

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.910
And then I realized this idea of
the power amplification effect.

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:55.780
Now, there's a good in the
power amplification effect.

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:57.550
When the powerful
express gratitude,

00:19:57.550 --> 00:19:59.415
it has a bigger impact.

00:19:59.415 --> 00:20:01.540
Ironically, my research
shows that the powerful are

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:03.510
less likely to
express gratitude,

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:04.920
but it does have
a bigger impact.

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:07.950
But small criticisms,
or even silence

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:10.390
get amplified and
become deafening

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:11.750
when they're done by power.

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:13.160
Now, what's the solution here?

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.040
Well, it's really easy.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:18.590
The first solution is
basically, tell them exactly why

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:19.930
you need to talk to them.

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:22.760
Or if it's too complicated
say, it's not a big deal.

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:23.690
Don't worry about it.

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:25.190
Or if it is a big
deal, you let them

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:28.120
know it's a big deal, so
they can come prepared.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:32.630
Now, when we have high and
low power people in a group,

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:34.010
now we have hierarchy.

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:36.280
And I want to tell you,
the final little topic I'll

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:38.000
tell you about
today, and then we'll

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.380
answer some questions
is, when hierarchy wins,

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:42.550
and when it kills.

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:44.700
When hierarchy is good,
and when it's bad.

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:48.140
Now, many years ago, when
Google got its start,

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:50.070
they were like, we're engineers.

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:51.900
We don't need any
managers, right?

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.410
We can do this on our own.

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:55.730
And it turned out there
was a lot of chaos.

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:58.000
Some of you probably
know about Zappos

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.150
has turned this idea of
a holacracy this vision

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:04.390
of self-managed groups.

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:08.940
And Tony Hsieh
introduced holacracy,

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:10.872
and he gave everyone an out.

00:21:10.872 --> 00:21:13.080
If you don't like your
experience in the first couple

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:16.360
months, on this day in April,
tell us you want to quit,

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.210
and we'll give you
three months severance.

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:19.730
Now, Tony Hsieh
often gives people

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:23.190
the opportunity to leave if
they're not happy at Zappos.

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:27.330
And historically, about
2% of Zappos employees

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:28.820
have taken the deal.

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:33.570
On this day in April,
14% of the firm left.

00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:38.020
And what happened is it was too
hard to coordinate behavior.

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:42.120
It was too difficult. And
so what a hierarchy provides

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:44.860
is it provides a
sense of coordination.

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:47.360
Now to understand this, I want
to ask you a simple question.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:51.090
Would you rather play a
game with your best friend

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:52.719
or your boss?

00:21:52.719 --> 00:21:54.510
Now, most people would
say, my best friend.

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:55.426
I love my best friend.

00:21:55.426 --> 00:21:56.670
We play games together.

00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:58.850
But I want to tell you
about this particular game.

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:01.430
The game has two options.

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:04.720
Option A is you get more
points, and more benefits,

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.670
more lottery tickets
than your partner.

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:08.830
And Option B, they get
double what you get.

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:09.330
Right?

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:10.720
So in option A, you get more.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.050
Option B, they get more.

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:14.420
Now, two play this
game, there's two rules.

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:16.090
One is, there's
no communication.

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:18.180
So you can't communicate
with the other person.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:21.500
And two is, you only
get lottery tickets

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:24.000
if you both choose
the same option.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.970
Now, imagine playing
the game with your boss.

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:29.840
You have option A, you have
option B, your boss thinks,

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.230
option B is what we should
pick, because I deserve more,

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:34.230
And you're like,yeah, my
boss does deserve more.

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:36.590
I'll pick option B,
we coordinate, because

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:38.120
of this pattern of deference.

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:40.109
We both get lottery tickets.

00:22:40.109 --> 00:22:41.900
Now, imagine playing
with your best friend.

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:43.733
You think, well, I don't
want to be selfish.

00:22:43.733 --> 00:22:46.597
I want to be generous to my best
friend, so I'll pick option B.

00:22:46.597 --> 00:22:48.430
And they're like, but
I want to be generous,

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:51.252
and then they pick option
A, you guys get nothing.

00:22:51.252 --> 00:22:53.460
Or you think I'm going to
be selfish, because they're

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:55.360
going to be generous,
I'll state option A,

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:58.470
but then they do the same thing,
and again you get nothing.

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:02.100
So notice what happens is
hierarchy or power differences

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:06.094
allow us to coordinate
behavior in situations.

00:23:06.094 --> 00:23:08.010
And to highlight this,
I want to take you back

00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:10.610
to a particular
day in 2010, when

00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:12.960
a young man named
LeBron James decided

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:16.420
to take his talents to Miami.

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:20.565
And what happened was they had a
big celebration that first day.

00:23:20.565 --> 00:23:24.060
And on that celebration, the
announcer said, let's welcome

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:28.000
these new amazing free agents,
Chris Bosh and LeBron James.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.520
It's Wade's house, it's LeBron's
kingdom, and it's Bosh's pit.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.880
But it couldn't
really be all three.

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:38.830
And it was very clear-- Bill
Simmons, a great writer,

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:41.229
said the day that they
did this-- it's like, I

00:23:41.229 --> 00:23:42.520
don't think it's going to work.

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:44.130
There's going to be
no pecking order.

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:45.630
And he was right.

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:46.534
Look at this.

00:23:46.534 --> 00:23:47.950
They couldn't win
the close games.

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:49.849
They were 29th our of
30 teams at the end,

00:23:49.849 --> 00:23:51.890
because they didn't know
who should get the ball.

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:53.231
Is it Wade or James?

00:23:53.231 --> 00:23:54.730
How are we going
to figure this out?

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:56.410
Who's going to
defer to the other?

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:59.030
And they lost in the
NBA finals that year.

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:01.700
The next year,
Wade hurt is knee,

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:06.230
became 40% of Dwayne Wade, and
they solved the dualing banjos

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:09.027
problem because of that,
and they won the next one.

00:24:09.027 --> 00:24:10.360
So I want to show you some data.

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:14.050
We collected 10
years of NBA data.

00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:17.254
We coded how much talent
there was in each team.

00:24:17.254 --> 00:24:19.170
And we looked to see how
well teams performed.

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:21.336
Well, we can notice here
something really important.

00:24:21.336 --> 00:24:25.610
As teams got more talent,
they did better, but only up

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:27.300
to a point.

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.690
After that point, there's
actually negative slope,

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:33.290
where too much talent
became problematic.

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:35.530
And I want you think a
lot about why you think

00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:38.070
this is so true in basketball.

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:41.610
It's because too much talent
made it difficult for them

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:43.350
to coordinate their behavior.

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:44.290
And we know this.

00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:46.748
One of the things that happened
when you got more talent is

00:24:46.748 --> 00:24:48.460
assists went down.

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:50.350
The probability of
making a shot when you've

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:52.910
received the ball from a pass
over when you've dribbled

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:54.510
is double.

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:56.370
It's a dramatic effect.

00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:59.037
And basically, the assists
went down when they did this.

00:24:59.037 --> 00:25:00.870
Now, I want you to think
for a second about,

00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:04.570
if you can think of another
sport, where maybe we don't

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:06.140
have a too much talent problem.

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:08.680
We have a never
enough talent problem.

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.950
Where more talent
is always better.

00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:15.474
It's something that's a little
different from basketball.

00:25:15.474 --> 00:25:16.890
It turns out that
we also analyzed

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:19.620
10 years of another
sport, which someone

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:25.010
called an individual sport
masquerading as a team sport.

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:26.150
And that's baseball.

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:29.305
And what we found is we just
found it just went up and up

00:25:29.305 --> 00:25:30.400
and up and up.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.400
More talent was always better.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:35.000
And so you can start to
understand that there's

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:41.050
a good in hierarchy when we
need to cooperate and coordinate

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:41.810
were behavior.

00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:44.070
We need some types
of [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:47.370
I want to ask you another
question is, as you can guess,

00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:49.310
I'm going to tell you
the bad in hierarchy.

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:50.721
What is the problem
of hierarchy?

00:25:50.721 --> 00:25:51.970
Hierarchy helps us coordinate.

00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:53.920
It creates patterns
of deference.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:56.680
It can be motivating, because I
want to move up the hierarchy.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.590
But what is the single
biggest problem of hierarchy?

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:04.460
Why can hierarchy also lead
groups to fail, do you think?

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:05.597
What does it think?

00:26:05.597 --> 00:26:09.340
AUDIENCE: Just one
person's [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:11.520
ADAM GALINSKY: We lose
diversity of thought.

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:14.300
Hierarchy prevents
less powerful people

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:15.980
from sharing their perspective.

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:17.740
I'm going to tell you
two examples where

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:18.930
this is the case.

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:22.290
The first is a study that
we did in the Himalayas.

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:26.030
We took every expedition
that's gone up the Himalayas

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:32.340
in the modern era, over 100
years, 5,000 expeditions,

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:35.320
and we analyzed, what
country do they come from?

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.730
Do they come from a country that
was very hierarchical, or more

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:39.880
egalitarian?

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:41.630
We found if they
came from a country,

00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:44.880
like Korea for example, that's
very hierarchical, they were

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:47.457
more likely to have people
die on the mountain,

00:26:47.457 --> 00:26:50.040
presumably because they didn't
feel comfortable with low power

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.570
people sharing their ideas.

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:53.200
Here's another famous example.

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:54.470
Surgery.

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:58.330
The single biggest problem
we have in surgery is this.

00:26:58.330 --> 00:26:59.880
Infections.

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:03.550
If an infection gets to the
main line, it's catastrophic.

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:04.410
And people die.

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:06.410
What's the single best
predictor of an infection

00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:08.050
getting to the main line?

00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:11.410
A doctor skipping
a checklist point.

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:13.780
So what we can see
here is what they

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:16.930
found is that nurses just didn't
feel comfortable speaking up.

00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:20.490
There's such a power status
gap between nurses and doctors

00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:23.780
that even when nurses saw the
doctor skip a crucial step,

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:27.220
they didn't force them to
go back and do that step.

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:30.020
So the bad in
hierarchy is that it

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:33.325
silences low power prospectives,
which can lead to disaster.

00:27:33.325 --> 00:27:34.980
Well, how do we
solve that problem?

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:36.330
I'll tell you two examples.

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:38.700
The first, let's go back
to the surgery example.

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:41.080
What did Johns Hopkins
do to solve this problem?

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:45.930
They gave the low power people
a little bit more power.

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:47.199
How did they do that?

00:27:47.199 --> 00:27:48.990
They said, you know
what we're going to do?

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:51.270
Nurses are in charge
of the checklist.

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:53.570
We're going to give them
authority over the checklist,

00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:56.980
and that means they feel license
and legitimated to say, Doctor,

00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:58.820
we got to make sure
we do this step.

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:03.040
And mainline infections went
down, and lives went up.

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:04.890
I'll give you a second
example of this.

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:06.560
So we want coordination.

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:09.020
We want to prevent the
science of low power.

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:11.040
We want coordination
of all voices.

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:15.170
Now, one of the worst things
we can do in a group is this.

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:16.900
Public voting.

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:19.176
What happens when
you vote publicly?

00:28:19.176 --> 00:28:21.050
You look to see what
other people are voting.

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:23.370
Who do we look
for in particular?

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:25.550
The high power
people in the room.

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:27.860
So one of the ways that
we can solve this problem,

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:31.580
we can get the coordination with
all hear voices being heard,

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:33.860
is by collecting
information privately.

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:35.510
And some people
have developed apps.

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:37.885
Here's this one that I found
called the candor app, which

00:28:37.885 --> 00:28:42.790
allows people sort of a means
to express things privately.

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:45.994
So we're trying to get these
benefits without the downside.

00:28:45.994 --> 00:28:47.410
Now I'm sure
everyone in this room

00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:49.375
has heard of a
company called IDO.

00:28:49.375 --> 00:28:52.670
And IDO is a
product design firm.

00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:55.210
They created the
first mouse for Apple.

00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:58.200
They created the Free
Willy whale, for example.

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:02.340
And they have very particular
rules to solve this problem.

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:04.280
Stage one is idea generation.

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:05.940
No hierarchy.

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:08.790
And no one can criticize
anybody's idea.

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:11.471
Stage two is evaluation time.

00:29:11.471 --> 00:29:12.220
How do we do that?

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.950
We do that anonymously,
with Post-It notes.

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:17.730
Stage three is implementation.

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:19.950
Now we need the hierarchy
to come back in,

00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:21.950
because we need to
coordinate people's behavior,

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:24.890
and we need to have someone
overseeing who does what, when,

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:26.030
and how.

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:29.210
So, what we'll try to do in
our little conversation today

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:32.470
is talk about that
every relationship

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:36.400
has an inherent tension between
cooperation and competition.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:39.420
We don't want to tip too
more towards corporation

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:41.800
or towards competition,
and we're constantly

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:43.780
oscillating back and forth.

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:49.020
Now, if we can solve this
problem, find this balance,

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:51.340
all of our relationships
are going to be better.

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:55.720
The final key thing
of this book is this.

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:57.370
Knowledge is power.

00:29:57.370 --> 00:30:00.160
Becoming aware that all
of our relationships

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:02.590
are beset by this
tension, corporation,

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:05.670
competition makes our
relationships better off.

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:06.170
Right?

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:07.747
Think about getting married.

00:30:07.747 --> 00:30:09.080
It's the time you come together.

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.280
You collaborate with
each other to form

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:12.960
this more perfect union.

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.250
And yet you're also competing
over different aspects

00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:15.990
of the wedding.

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:18.811
But becoming aware
of this makes you

00:30:18.811 --> 00:30:21.060
navigate that minefield a
little bit more effectively.

00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:23.710
I just got married
actually four weeks ago.

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:25.750
So I am well aware of that one.

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:27.225
Or collaborating on a book.

00:30:27.225 --> 00:30:28.600
Co-authoring a
book with someone.

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:30.183
Once you become aware
of that tension,

00:30:30.183 --> 00:30:31.520
it allows you to make choices.

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:33.630
I want this, but I'm also
aware they want that.

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:37.580
How can we find the right
balance between these forces?

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:40.480
So the final thing
that I'll say,

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.120
besides giving you some ways
to stay connected with us,

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.520
is I just want to tell you
three other quick things

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.970
about the book, and then
we'll answer as many questions

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:49.080
as you have.

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:52.110
The first thing is we
have lots of topics.

00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:53.550
So here's one topic
we talk about,

00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:55.770
is how many gender
differences that we

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:58.170
might attribute to
biology are really just

00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:00.340
power differences in disguise.

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:03.290
And we talk about
how women can lean in

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:05.790
without getting push back in
a number of different ways

00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:09.010
that the organization and
other features can do that.

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:12.070
We talk about, how do we get
people to trust us quickly,

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:14.950
but how do we detect deception,
so we don't fall prey

00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:16.990
to their trust techniques?

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:20.580
And if we misstep, how do we
bring the pieces back together

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:22.430
and apologize effectively?

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:25.010
And then finally, we talk about,
when do we start our engines

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:26.330
in a competitive interaction?

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:28.520
Do I want to be the
first one interviewed,

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:29.840
or the last one interviewed?

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:32.100
Do I want to be on the
top of a political ballot

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:33.272
or farther down?

00:31:33.272 --> 00:31:35.480
Do I want to make the first
offer in the negotiation,

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:38.430
or do I want to receive that
first offer in a negotiation?

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:41.910
And so, we take this
lens of friend and foe,

00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:44.510
but apply it in lots
of different ranges.

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:46.970
So we're more than happy
to answer some questions.

00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:48.640
Thank you guys so much.

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.650
AUDIENCE: So I was
curious about any insight

00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:53.540
you have into comparisons
under uncertainty.

00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:55.690
So specifically, you
mentioned pay disparities.

00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:56.940
MAURICE SCHWEITZER: Yes, yeah.

00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:58.340
AUDIENCE: Hot in the
press these days.

00:31:58.340 --> 00:31:59.423
MAURICE SCHWEITZER: Right.

00:31:59.423 --> 00:32:02.680
AUDIENCE: So when you have
reasonable expectation

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:04.940
that there is a difference,
or might be a difference,

00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:06.779
but no concrete evidence?

00:32:06.779 --> 00:32:08.070
MAURICE SCHWEITZER: Yeah, yeah.

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:12.460
So we're constantly
searching for evidence.

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:15.830
And salary's a great example.

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:19.390
It's very hard for us to assess
how well we're doing on salary.

00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:21.620
We all have plenty
of food to eat.

00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:22.635
But the conditions--

00:32:22.635 --> 00:32:23.170
ADAM GALINSKY:
Especially at Google.

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:24.109
But, yeah.

00:32:24.109 --> 00:32:25.900
MAURICE SCHWEITZER:
Yeah., especially here.

00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:29.740
But we're incredibly
driven to figure out

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:32.530
where we are in some hierarchy.

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:37.760
The information that
we have is limited.

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:41.630
And so one key
idea to suggest is

00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:44.360
that we engage in
these comparisons,

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:46.650
we're searching for
them, but we never

00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:47.990
have complete information.

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:49.610
Ever.

00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:51.920
Sometimes, we will
feed you information,

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:55.350
and the information we get
can be systematically biased.

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:57.576
So in a negotiation, I
might give you like, woah,

00:32:57.576 --> 00:32:59.700
here are all the people
that paid more for this car

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:03.190
than you did, or we might look
on Facebook and say, oh, well,

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:04.620
how's my vacation?

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:07.690
And oh my god, all these
vacations look better.

00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:09.390
Because the really
lousy vacation

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:12.210
photos sometimes
don't make it there.

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:15.230
So we're getting systematically
biased information

00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:16.920
as a matter of course.

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:20.200
And it's for us to try to
figure out how to navigate that.

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:24.950
Now, as managers, there are a
few things that we can do this.

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:29.050
We might describe
ranges of salaries

00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:30.990
that people are
getting, rather than

00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:33.380
making complete disclosure
of like, OK, here's how

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:35.760
much everybody else is getting.

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.510
We see this at universities.

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:40.560
Public universities
have to post salaries,

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:42.677
and that could make people
perfectly miserable.

00:33:42.677 --> 00:33:44.510
ADAM GALINSKY: Whereas
private schools, sort

00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:46.850
of like at Northwestern,
for example,

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:49.770
they do the 25th percentile
of all associate professors

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:51.720
in the Kellogg Business
School, and they also

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.000
do the 75th percentile.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.310
So you can see sort of--
you can access were you,

00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:58.440
but I don't know what my
colleague is exactly getting.

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:00.460
But your question's
also really important,

00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:02.140
because one of
the things that we

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:03.910
talk about it in the
chapter about gender

00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:06.960
is one of the single
best predictors

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:11.070
of reducing gender disparities
is having accurate information.

00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:13.040
And so the United
States, for example,

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:15.770
had an executive order
of more transparency,

00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:17.449
and what were the
rates of promotion

00:34:17.449 --> 00:34:20.360
by gender, for example, and
they showed an increase.

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:24.469
Australia, what they did is they
decided that every company that

00:34:24.469 --> 00:34:27.100
reported to the
Australian Stock Exchange

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:31.010
had to release information,
both about promotion rates,

00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:33.170
but also how they went
about selecting people

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:34.750
for different jobs
and promotions.

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:39.010
And the percentage of women
went up 50% within two years

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:40.150
in management roles.

00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:42.799
And so one of the things
is we talk about is,

00:34:42.799 --> 00:34:44.590
transparency is actually
one of the hopeful

00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:49.113
things for reducing some of the
biases that exist in the world.

00:34:49.113 --> 00:34:50.779
Somehow, we didn't
answer your question.

00:34:50.779 --> 00:34:51.697
AUDIENCE: No, no, no.

00:34:51.697 --> 00:34:53.354
But it's a little bit
at odds, but you also

00:34:53.354 --> 00:34:54.978
said some kind of
transparency can make

00:34:54.978 --> 00:34:56.136
people perfectly miserable.

00:34:56.136 --> 00:34:56.969
ADAM GALINSKY: Yeah.

00:34:56.969 --> 00:34:58.469
MAURICE SCHWEITZER:
Yeah, miserable.

00:34:58.469 --> 00:35:04.970
So I think what's really report
is to have procedures in place.

00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:06.490
You want systematic procedures.

00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:09.150
You want a transparent system.

00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:11.190
And that's really important.

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:14.400
And we want to think
about making broader

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.920
structural changes,
there's are some problem,

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:21.040
that transparency can be really
helpful in fixing problems.

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:24.290
Individually, the transparency
of how much people

00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:26.247
are making, that could
make people just crazy.

00:35:26.247 --> 00:35:27.080
ADAM GALINSKY: Yeah.

00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:29.740
I think if I know what
every individual wants.

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:33.470
But when Walmart was hit
with a class action suit, one

00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:36.571
of things that happened was,
you might say, oh, women

00:35:36.571 --> 00:35:37.820
have less experience than men.

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:39.540
That's why they're getting
paid-- it actually turned out

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:40.870
women had more
experience than men,

00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:42.453
and they were still
getting paid less.

00:35:42.453 --> 00:35:43.920
And so, I don't
know exactly what

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:46.250
this particular man or this
particular woman makes,

00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:47.870
but having some
assessment actually

00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:51.000
is really important in
that sense, in the same way

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.600
that I prefer Northwestern's
system of letting

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:55.960
us know the 25th and
75th percentile more

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:59.730
than knowing what each colleague
in my department makes.

00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:05.060
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned that
praise from your higher-ups

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:07.970
is more valued, but
it's more scarce.

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:11.641
So if it was more common, would
it still be valued as highly?

00:36:11.641 --> 00:36:13.640
ADAM GALINSKY: Yeah, so
that's a great question.

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:15.810
So I think that-- you
can just hold onto it.

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:23.060
So we know that scarce
things are more valuable,

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:25.340
and we also know that things
that come from high power

00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:27.050
people are more impactful.

00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:29.620
I think that there is one
element of that scarcity,

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:31.300
but I think that
some of the research

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:35.910
shows that even high power
people who praise frequently,

00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:37.690
it still has this huge impact.

00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:40.970
It's especially impactful,
though, when high power people

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:45.010
praise in a descriptive rather
than sort of a general way.

00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:48.430
Like saying, what you
did today was fantastic,

00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:51.730
is really great, rather like
oh, you're doing a great job.

00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:54.380
And so the more descriptive--
feedback in general,

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:56.670
the more descriptive it is,
the more valuable it is.

00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:59.430
And that amplification effect
gets even more amplified then

00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:00.490
in that case.

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:01.990
That's a great
question, because you

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:04.880
have these competing variables,
scarcity and the high power

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:06.140
aspect.

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:08.430
AUDIENCE: So given a
choice between cooperating

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:10.130
and competing, this
sound very similar

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:12.330
to the classical
prisoner's dilemma, where

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:15.580
lack of communication
is leading to a person

00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:18.210
having to decide whether to
compete versus cooperate.

00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:21.540
Do you guys have any
idea of where or how

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:24.510
could be change a competition
into a cooperation?

00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:25.719
How do we enable that at all?

00:37:25.719 --> 00:37:26.760
MAURICE SCHWEITZER: Yeah.

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:28.340
So there are a
couple of ideas here.

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:31.330
One is, if we could think
about it structurally,

00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:34.440
if we start cooperatively,
we signal our intentions,

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.310
that can get us off
on the right foot.

00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:38.060
And in a lot of
our interactions,

00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:40.680
we can do this by one on
one interactions with things

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:43.070
like non-task communication.

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:45.740
So we don't get right
down to business.

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:47.070
We chitchat first.

00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:50.900
We talk about sports, or the
weather, or something else.

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:54.770
Now more broadly, if we have
a really competitive person,

00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:57.420
the best way to transform
a very competitive person

00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:01.850
into a cooperative person
is to put them on a team,

00:38:01.850 --> 00:38:04.020
and have them compete
with some other team.

00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:07.330
Or we think of one
organization, we're

00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:09.620
competing with some
other organization.

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:13.240
And that can get somebody who's
really competitive, and now as

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.800
soon as they say, oh no, we're
competing with somebody else,

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:18.567
now they're incredibly
intensely cooperative.

00:38:18.567 --> 00:38:20.900
ADAM GALINSKY: And I think
structurally, the other thing

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:23.690
that you can do is we can change
the very nature of the game.

00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:25.350
So one of our
favorite studies-- I

00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:27.440
know Maurice loves
this too-- is they

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:30.030
took the prisoner's dilemma,
didn't change any aspect of it.

00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:32.564
So it's the same typical point.

00:38:32.564 --> 00:38:34.980
There's this conflict between
cooperation and competition,

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:37.177
but the incentives lean
towards competition.

00:38:37.177 --> 00:38:38.760
And they just told
people, we're going

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:40.170
to have you played game today.

00:38:40.170 --> 00:38:41.824
It's called the
Wall Street game.

00:38:41.824 --> 00:38:43.240
And then people
just went straight

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:44.427
to the competitive decision.

00:38:44.427 --> 00:38:46.260
Or they said we're going
to play game today.

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:47.860
It's called the Community Game.

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:50.161
And then people were much
more likely to choose

00:38:50.161 --> 00:38:51.660
the cooperative
choice, even thought

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:53.184
the incentives hadn't changed.

00:38:53.184 --> 00:38:54.600
So some of the
ways that we can do

00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:58.150
is we can create that external
enemy, which is great.

00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:00.350
Other ways we can change
the nature of the task,

00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:03.790
and how we describe it, as
another example of doing that.

00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:06.430
And I think as Marie
said, one of the best ways

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:08.020
is path dependence.

00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:09.300
Start with cooperation.

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:12.260
If you go back to
Axelrod he came up

00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:16.290
with the famous-- the thing that
beats all other prison dilemma

00:39:16.290 --> 00:39:16.856
games of all.

00:39:16.856 --> 00:39:18.310
It's called Tit For Tat.

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:19.150
How's that work?

00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:20.480
You start by cooperating.

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:23.020
You cooperate as long as
the other person cooperates.

00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:25.310
As soon as they defect
for the first time,

00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:26.870
you switch to defection.

00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:29.680
You keep defecting until
they go back to cooperation,

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:31.300
and then you go
back to cooperation.

00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:35.050
And that showed over-- it beat
every other possible strategy

00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:37.240
that existed in the world
in the prison's dilemma.

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:40.270
So the most important
thing is start corporation,

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:42.720
come with the right
labels, Community Game,

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:45.600
not Wall Street Game, and
come up with external threats

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:48.580
that you can come
back together on.

00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:50.580
AUDIENCE: So I'm
wondering about,

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:54.490
is there a clear distinction
between competing

00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:56.590
and being aggressive?

00:39:56.590 --> 00:40:02.640
And also maybe slightly
differently, have you

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:06.100
any insight into
say, the problem

00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:13.150
of social fairness towards
people who perhaps culturally

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:16.160
maybe-- like, the stereotypical
geeks, or whatever,

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:19.910
who are less likely to compete.

00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:22.650
MAURICE SCHWEITZER: Yeah.

00:40:22.650 --> 00:40:25.990
Culturally, I talked
about fairness,

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:28.430
the idea about
comparisons and fairness

00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:29.720
seemingly are hard-wired.

00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:33.710
So I showed you evidence
from cachupin monkeys.

00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:36.510
It's true here in
the United States,

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:38.800
and it's true internationally.

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.620
There's a fun-- there's
one parable, it's

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:44.860
a Russian parable, about a
man who finds a lamp, rubs

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:47.080
the lamp, a genie
appears, and says

00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:49.010
I can grant you
any wish you want.

00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:52.710
The condition is your
neighbor gets double.

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:54.292
So he paces back and forth.

00:40:54.292 --> 00:40:56.000
He thinks really hard
about this problem.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.170
And finally he says,
oh, I know what I want.

00:40:58.170 --> 00:40:59.753
I want you to poke
out one of my eyes.

00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:04.735
What I want to suggest is
that for many of us sort

00:41:04.735 --> 00:41:11.060
of very broadly, we have
this intense comparison

00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:12.710
and competitive drive.

00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:16.740
Now, some of us aren't as
assertive or aggressive as we

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:18.740
can be.

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:21.410
Adam's research was talking
about the power priming.

00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:24.150
When we think of a
time that we had power,

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:26.740
we psychologically feel
like we have power,

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:31.490
and that gets us to approach
problems and be more assertive.

00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:33.240
ADAM GALINSKY: And I
think one of the ways

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:35.230
that we solve this
problem, we talk about this

00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:37.910
in the when and how to
start your engines chapter,

00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:41.420
is how do you make an
ambitious first offer that

00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:43.270
also signals cooperation.

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:45.580
So how do you anchor the
negotiation in your direction,

00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:48.570
so you're being competitive,
but you're somehow signaling

00:41:48.570 --> 00:41:49.821
corporation to the other side?

00:41:49.821 --> 00:41:51.611
And there's actually
a technique that we've

00:41:51.611 --> 00:41:54.140
created that's incredibly
effective, which is what I do,

00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:57.120
is I offer you a
choice among offers.

00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:59.860
So I say, look, here's
two or three offers.

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:01.320
I'm indifferent between them.

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:03.010
You pick the one
that's best for you,

00:42:03.010 --> 00:42:04.385
and we can make
a deal right now.

00:42:04.385 --> 00:42:07.280
So let's say you're
going with cars.

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.790
You're like, I can
give you this car

00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:10.895
in this color with this mileage.

00:42:10.895 --> 00:42:11.830
You know, a used car.

00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:14.080
Or I could give you this
car in a different color

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:15.489
with some different mileage.

00:42:15.489 --> 00:42:18.030
And I'm going to give you the
same price for both those cars.

00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:19.696
You just pick the one
you like the most.

00:42:19.696 --> 00:42:22.590
Now, we may be anchoring the
negotiation in our favor.

00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:24.400
But because we're
giving you a choice,

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.000
we're signaling corporation.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.450
And so our research has
shown that people walk out

00:42:28.450 --> 00:42:31.456
being like, that was a
cooperative flexible person.

00:42:31.456 --> 00:42:32.830
But we showed that
by doing that,

00:42:32.830 --> 00:42:34.204
I actually got a
much better deal

00:42:34.204 --> 00:42:37.490
than I would have if I had
just given you one offer.

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:41.250
MAURICE SCHWEITZER: So
intensity will be different.

00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:43.750
I don't want to suggest that
the cultural differences aren't

00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:44.307
important.

00:42:44.307 --> 00:42:46.140
Our cultural differences
are very important,

00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:49.070
and they will guide
very different behavior,

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:52.720
like Adam's research talking
about the Himalayan Mountains

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:53.740
expedition.

00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:58.140
So culture matters for sure.

00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:00.640
What I am saying is that
a lot of these principles

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:03.180
are so profound--
that is, they're

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:07.200
hard-wired into the architecture
of our brains-- all of us

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:08.940
engage in comparisons.

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:11.220
Now, some of us
are crazy about it.

00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:13.224
So some of us check
Facebook all the time.

00:43:13.224 --> 00:43:15.265
We're constantly monitoring
what people are doing

00:43:15.265 --> 00:43:16.640
and how they're doing it.

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:19.240
And some of us kind of
skate through life caring

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:20.510
less about it.

00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:23.490
What I am suggesting is that
all of us care about it,

00:43:23.490 --> 00:43:25.390
and these comparisons
give us meaning.

00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:28.890
We can't get away from them,
and so they're hard-wired.

00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:32.090
But there are definitely
individual differences

00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:33.530
and cultural differences.

00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:35.050
ADAM GALINSKY: Yeah, I think
two just other quick things

00:43:35.050 --> 00:43:35.800
to say about that.

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:39.930
One is what we compare is going
to depend partially on culture.

00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:42.890
So in some cultures,
the car that you drive

00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:45.800
has a huge impact on
how people treat you,

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:48.860
and I want to have a better
car than my neighbor,

00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:50.740
and so the car is
a big distinction.

00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:52.950
Other people, it might
be what technology,

00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:54.090
like what phone you have.

00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:57.360
Do you the latest greatest
Android phone, for example?

00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:58.430
Not the iPhone.

00:43:58.430 --> 00:44:02.610
But you know, things like that
can make a big difference.

00:44:02.610 --> 00:44:07.260
So context and culture
really alter those dynamics.

00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:09.890
And I think one of the
things, like with power,

00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:12.410
is power exists
in every society,

00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:15.620
but it has some sort of
slightly different effects,

00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:16.800
depending on the society.

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:18.970
So how those patterns
of deference play out,

00:44:18.970 --> 00:44:20.360
and when they matter.

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:23.390
And for example, the
power amplification effect

00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:25.840
is even stronger in
some East Asian cultures

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:27.530
than it is an American cultures.

00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:31.489
Criticism by boss is so painful
in some cultures, stories

00:44:31.489 --> 00:44:33.405
of people committing
suicide just because they

00:44:33.405 --> 00:44:34.950
were criticized in a meeting.

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:37.050
That seems hard to
believe from our culture.

00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:38.640
Even though we're going
to have the same impact,

00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:40.139
the intensity is
going to be greater

00:44:40.139 --> 00:44:41.530
in some cultures than others.

00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:43.265
So that's great question.

00:44:43.265 --> 00:44:44.390
I learned that from Sechin.

00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:45.598
That's a great question, sir.

00:44:45.598 --> 00:44:49.092
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
encourage people to ask.

00:44:49.092 --> 00:44:51.300
AUDIENCE: As you both are
business school professors,

00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:54.300
do you also infer
changes to how people

00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:55.550
should manage their companies?

00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:57.320
How HR systems should be set up?

00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:59.610
Performance, evaluation,
things like that?

00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:01.699
Do you transfer these findings?

00:45:01.699 --> 00:45:02.740
MAURICE SCHWEITZER: Yeah.

00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:05.880
I mean, interesting.

00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:09.200
We're actually working on
a piece right now talking

00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:12.260
about diversity
training programs.

00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:15.340
A lot of diversity training
programs, for example, fail.

00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:18.430
So simply raising awareness
sometimes isn't enough.

00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:21.780
We need to think about
more systematic approaches

00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:24.070
for mentoring and so on.

00:45:24.070 --> 00:45:28.110
When it comes to the kind of
feedback that we give people,

00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:30.640
so the feedback systems
should be different.

00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:32.640
When it comes to the
way we share information

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:35.030
about salary information.

00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:39.530
So they all have direct
applications for these ideas,

00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:44.907
and they should guide manageable
action and corporate policy.

00:45:44.907 --> 00:45:47.490
ADAM GALINSKY: And I also think
that finding the right balance

00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:49.073
with hierarchy is
so important, right?

00:45:49.073 --> 00:45:52.114
We know the absence of
hierarchy leads to chaos.

00:45:52.114 --> 00:45:54.530
And one of the things-- we
were giving this talk yesterday

00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:55.720
at Zillow, and
someone pointed out

00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:57.160
that a friend
worked at a company

00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:58.868
where they tried not
having any managers.

00:45:58.868 --> 00:46:00.390
And what it really
means is nobody

00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:02.361
does the jobs that
nobody wants to do.

00:46:02.361 --> 00:46:02.860
Right?

00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:05.340
Because no one does
it because-- and so

00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:08.070
you need someone who says,
OK, you have to do this job.

00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:09.224
We have to get this done.

00:46:09.224 --> 00:46:10.640
You need some
[INAUDIBLE] control,

00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:12.890
but you don't want to
silence low power voices

00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:14.220
and prevent innovation.

00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:16.220
And so you need to
find some that balance

00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:18.410
between coordination and
silencing low voices,

00:46:18.410 --> 00:46:19.676
and what's that level?

00:46:19.676 --> 00:46:20.800
I'm not a fan of holacracy.

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:23.300
I don't think that's a very
good people management strategy.

00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:25.990
I think it'll probably
fail in the long-term.

00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:29.620
Because just as Google needed
managers, not just engineers,

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:31.820
is that we need to
have some sort of sense

00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:35.590
of coordination mechanisms and
devices that get into play.

00:46:35.590 --> 00:46:38.730
But I think one of the things
that HR need to recognize

00:46:38.730 --> 00:46:40.760
is, how do you find
the right balance?

00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:42.510
Another example,
just really briefly,

00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:45.590
is team awards versus
individual awards.

00:46:45.590 --> 00:46:46.180
Right?

00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:48.660
And the research shows, if you
just have individual awards,

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:50.050
you get competitive behavior.

00:46:50.050 --> 00:46:52.990
If you just have team rewards,
you get social loafing.

00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:54.612
So you need to have
some combination.

00:46:54.612 --> 00:46:55.820
What's the exact combination?

00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:57.340
That's a tougher
question to answer.

00:46:57.340 --> 00:47:00.660
But some combination of rewards
that tie people together,

00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:02.490
but still motivate
individual performance.

00:47:02.490 --> 00:47:03.823
You're going to ask a follow-up.

00:47:03.823 --> 00:47:06.532
AUDIENCE: Do you a company that
gets the hierarchy thing right?

00:47:06.532 --> 00:47:08.740
ADAM GALINSKY: Well, I have
to say Google, of course,

00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:09.570
gets it perfectly.

00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:11.220
But it's uh--

00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:12.912
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:12.912 --> 00:47:15.530
MAURICE SCHWEITZER:
You don't think so.

00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:18.700
ADAM GALINSKY: I think
there's-- I mean,

00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:21.410
I think a lot of successful
companies are doing this.

00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:23.344
And I think a lot of
Silicon Valley companies

00:47:23.344 --> 00:47:25.760
have been successful in trying
to find that right balance.

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:28.610
And I think some of them-- I
think like Zappos have tipped

00:47:28.610 --> 00:47:30.340
too far towards one direction.

00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:33.360
We just spoke at
Microsoft the other day.

00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:35.890
And I think some people felt
Microsoft might have tipped

00:47:35.890 --> 00:47:38.550
too far towards
hierarchy level, and too

00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:40.890
much sort of individual
awards and competitions

00:47:40.890 --> 00:47:41.590
around that too.

00:47:41.590 --> 00:47:43.820
And so it's tough to
find that balance.

00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:45.361
MAURICE SCHWEITZER:
Let me just offer

00:47:45.361 --> 00:47:48.070
one other example
to sort of suggest

00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:50.030
that it's a constant struggle.

00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:52.490
If you look at the
military, the military's

00:47:52.490 --> 00:47:55.380
this classic
hierarchical structure.

00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:57.030
So we have a lot
of different ranks,

00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:59.120
and you have to follow orders.

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:04.050
And for many tasks that just
require people to do things

00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:07.110
that they don't want to do,
you need strong hierarchy

00:48:07.110 --> 00:48:10.910
that moves people in a
very coordinated way.

00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:15.360
And yet, for new challenges, you
think about the Special Forces.

00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:19.010
And the Special Forces, they've
broken down the hierarchy.

00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:20.530
And there, it's much flatter.

00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:21.780
You have very different roles.

00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:23.280
People can speak
back to their boss.

00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:25.140
They can disagree.

00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:27.470
And here within
same organization,

00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:30.340
they've created very different
hierarchical structures

00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:32.910
to tackle different
kinds of problems.

00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:37.262
So the nature of the task
needs to fit the hierarchy.

00:48:37.262 --> 00:48:38.720
ADAM GALINSKY: And
notice something

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:40.820
else about the Special
Forces is, they

00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:42.611
tend to be smaller groups.

00:48:42.611 --> 00:48:43.110
Right?

00:48:43.110 --> 00:48:45.930
As these groups get bigger,
you need a little bit more,

00:48:45.930 --> 00:48:48.010
some type of
mechanisms of control.

00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:50.340
But when you're going in,
and you're a 20 person team,

00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:53.050
it's a little bit easier for
you to handle those situations.

00:48:53.050 --> 00:48:57.090
And so, I think that's
another great example of it.

00:48:57.090 --> 00:48:58.475
AUDIENCE: So I have a question.

00:48:58.475 --> 00:49:00.890
A few months, I read Adam
Grant's book, "Give and Take,"

00:49:00.890 --> 00:49:03.070
which I assume you both
are somewhat familiar with.

00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:05.720
Basically, it says there are
givers, takers, and matchers.

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:07.616
And if I'm
remembering correctly,

00:49:07.616 --> 00:49:09.240
when interacting with
a quote, unquote,

00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:12.140
"taker," the people who
are really successful

00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:15.010
are those who basically
stop giving to that person

00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:17.110
until they become a
matcher, so to speak.

00:49:17.110 --> 00:49:19.340
So in applying it
to this, I'm curious

00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:21.803
if-- assuming that you can't
create an external enemy

00:49:21.803 --> 00:49:25.160
or anything, if someone is
a super competitive person,

00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:28.610
isn't it better to adjust and to
also be pretty competitive back

00:49:28.610 --> 00:49:30.910
to that person until
they become a little bit

00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:32.036
more middle of the road?

00:49:32.036 --> 00:49:34.160
ADAM GALINSKY: That's
exactly the tit for tat thing

00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:35.530
that I mentioned that.

00:49:35.530 --> 00:49:38.240
The single best strategy
for the prisoner's dilemma

00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:40.390
is signal corporation,
cooperate,

00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:42.890
if they compete, compete
with them until they're

00:49:42.890 --> 00:49:44.410
willing to go back
to cooperation,

00:49:44.410 --> 00:49:45.590
and then you switch back.

00:49:45.590 --> 00:49:46.910
And I think that's right.

00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:49.450
I think that the one
thing that really, I

00:49:49.450 --> 00:49:52.723
think, changes the very
essence-- and Adam Grant's book

00:49:52.723 --> 00:49:53.340
is great.

00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:55.952
And obviously, he's a colleague
of Maurice's, and we know him

00:49:55.952 --> 00:49:56.910
very well.

00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:58.740
Wrote a blurb for the book.

00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:01.760
But I think, really, what our
book is fundamentally different

00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:04.007
about this is this
idea that we don't just

00:50:04.007 --> 00:50:05.590
have givers, and
takers, and matchers,

00:50:05.590 --> 00:50:08.220
it's that in every
relationship, there's

00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:10.510
this tension between
cooperation and competition.

00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:12.285
And we have to be aware of that.

00:50:12.285 --> 00:50:13.660
And we have to
ask ourselves, how

00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:14.800
do we find the right balance?

00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:16.216
So I'll just give
you one example.

00:50:16.216 --> 00:50:19.340
Maurice does is great thing in
his negotiations class, where

00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:20.640
you negotiate every week.

00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:22.510
You have to write
down little thoughts

00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:23.719
about like, your negotiation.

00:50:23.719 --> 00:50:25.426
And then about half
way through the class

00:50:25.426 --> 00:50:26.930
he says, OK, what
I want you to do

00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:29.345
is I want you to go back and
read your first five or six

00:50:29.345 --> 00:50:29.845
weeks.

00:50:29.845 --> 00:50:31.910
And I want you to ask
yourself this question,

00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:34.470
am I cooperating too
much, and am I getting

00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:36.530
exploited in the negotiations?

00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:38.450
Am I competing too
much consistently,

00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:41.590
so maybe I'm killing joint
gain and expanding the pie?

00:50:41.590 --> 00:50:43.430
Or am I finding
the right balance.

00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:45.890
If I'm over here, how
can I get over here?

00:50:45.890 --> 00:50:46.390
Right?

00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:49.090
If I'm too far this way,
how do I get back to here?

00:50:49.090 --> 00:50:51.970
And I think that reflection
is really important.

00:50:51.970 --> 00:50:54.110
A lot of it's about this
sort of self-understanding

00:50:54.110 --> 00:50:57.180
of that tension, and trying
to find the right path.

00:50:57.180 --> 00:50:59.950
And I see Sechin just
looked at his watch,

00:50:59.950 --> 00:51:02.260
so I think we have time
for one more question.

00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:04.140
Yeah?

00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:07.220
AUDIENCE: So I'm seeing
a lot of discussion

00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:09.740
where it leads to
like, a 50-50 harmony.

00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:17.236
But how does the competition
versus cooperation-- there

00:51:17.236 --> 00:51:21.512
we go-- affect in terms
of like innovation?

00:51:21.512 --> 00:51:23.470
I feel like we don't talk
about the innovation.

00:51:23.470 --> 00:51:24.760
We talk more about like,
just keeping the peace.

00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:26.760
ADAM GALINSKY: Well, I've
spoken 53% of the time,

00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:28.385
so I'm going to let
Maurice answer that

00:51:28.385 --> 00:51:29.766
question to make it more 50-50.

00:51:29.766 --> 00:51:31.640
MAURICE SCHWEITZER:
Well, I mean, it's funny,

00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:34.950
because you
mentioned innovation.

00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:39.610
With innovation, that's where
we want to break down hierarchy

00:51:39.610 --> 00:51:41.010
to sort of free these ideas.

00:51:41.010 --> 00:51:45.490
And Adam was talking
about examples from IDO,

00:51:45.490 --> 00:51:48.700
where when we're
generating ideas,

00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:51.220
we want to remove criticism.

00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:52.680
Now, here's one idea.

00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:54.680
Ironically, we actually
want some rules.

00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:58.620
We want rules about no
interruptions, no criticism.

00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:00.050
With those rules,
we can actually

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:05.660
set ourselves freer to explore
ideas to be more creative.

00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:08.360
And we want to separate
the idea creation stage

00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:10.702
from the idea criticism stage.

00:52:10.702 --> 00:52:12.910
ADAM GALINSKY: And The New
York City Fire Department,

00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:15.380
for example, when they're
trying to implement or come up

00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:17.176
with new ways of
fighting fires, they

00:52:17.176 --> 00:52:19.050
want people from all
different ranks and part

00:52:19.050 --> 00:52:21.950
of the organization, when they
come into those conversations,

00:52:21.950 --> 00:52:23.742
they're not allowed to
wear their uniforms.

00:52:23.742 --> 00:52:25.283
Because all of a
sudden, rank becomes

00:52:25.283 --> 00:52:27.180
such a big, compelling
force, and we really

00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:30.260
want people to feel
comfortable sharing ideas.

00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:31.910
But the single
greatest way for you

00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:33.826
to find this right balance
between corporation

00:52:33.826 --> 00:52:36.691
and competition
and innovation is

00:52:36.691 --> 00:52:38.315
buying three or four
copies of the book

00:52:38.315 --> 00:52:39.635
and getting us to sign it.

00:52:39.635 --> 00:52:42.200
So that's really the key
thing to the whole thing.

00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:44.415
Well, thank you guys
so much for coming out.

00:52:44.415 --> 00:52:46.290
We're happy to sign the
books and everything.

00:52:46.290 --> 00:52:49.340
[APPLAUSE]
