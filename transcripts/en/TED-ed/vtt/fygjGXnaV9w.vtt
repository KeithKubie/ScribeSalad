00:00:06.658 --> 00:00:08.648
In March of 1892,

00:00:08.648 --> 00:00:11.418
three Black grocery store owners 
in Memphis, Tennessee,

00:00:11.418 --> 00:00:14.118
were murdered by a mob of white men.

00:00:14.118 --> 00:00:17.408
Lynchings like these were happening 
all over the American South,

00:00:17.408 --> 00:00:20.048
often without any subsequent legal 
investigation

00:00:20.048 --> 00:00:22.638
or consequences for the murderers.

00:00:22.638 --> 00:00:23.628
But this time,

00:00:23.628 --> 00:00:25.928
a young journalist and 
friend of the victims

00:00:25.928 --> 00:00:28.678
set out to expose the truth 
about these killings.

00:00:28.678 --> 00:00:30.578
Her reports would shock the nation

00:00:30.578 --> 00:00:33.158
and launch her career as an 
investigative journalist,

00:00:33.158 --> 00:00:35.968
civic leader, and civil rights advocate.

00:00:35.968 --> 00:00:38.428
Her name was Ida B. Wells.

00:00:38.428 --> 00:00:42.058
Ida Bell Wells was born into slavery 
in Holly Springs, Mississippi

00:00:42.058 --> 00:00:47.088
on July 16, 1862, several months before
the Emancipation Proclamation

00:00:47.088 --> 00:00:49.488
released her and her family.

00:00:49.488 --> 00:00:53.788
After losing both parents and a brother 
to yellow fever at the age of 16,

00:00:53.788 --> 00:00:55.968
she supported her five remaining siblings

00:00:55.968 --> 00:00:59.258
by working as a schoolteacher 
in Memphis, Tennessee.

00:00:59.258 --> 00:01:00.168
During this time,

00:01:00.168 --> 00:01:02.098
she began working as a journalist.

00:01:02.098 --> 00:01:04.088
Writing under the pen name “Iola,”

00:01:04.088 --> 00:01:06.558
by the early 1890s she gained 
a reputation

00:01:06.558 --> 00:01:09.218
as a clear voice against racial injustice

00:01:09.218 --> 00:01:11.416
and become co-owner and editor

00:01:11.416 --> 00:01:14.626
of the Memphis Free Speech 
and Headlight newspaper.

00:01:14.626 --> 00:01:16.416
She had no shortage of material:

00:01:16.416 --> 00:01:18.406
in the decades following the Civil War,

00:01:18.406 --> 00:01:20.776
Southern whites attempted to reassert 
their power

00:01:20.776 --> 00:01:22.796
by committing crimes against Black people

00:01:22.796 --> 00:01:24.586
including suppressing their votes,

00:01:24.586 --> 00:01:28.126
vandalizing their businesses, 
and even murdering them.

00:01:28.126 --> 00:01:29.776
After the murder of her friends,

00:01:29.776 --> 00:01:32.926
Wells launched an investigation 
into lynching.

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:36.656
She analyzed specific cases through 
newspaper reports and police records,

00:01:36.656 --> 00:01:40.606
and interviewed people who had lost 
friends and family to lynch mobs.

00:01:40.606 --> 00:01:43.326
She risked her life 
to get this information.

00:01:43.326 --> 00:01:46.326
As a Black person investigating racially 
motivated murders,

00:01:46.326 --> 00:01:50.576
she enraged many of the same southern 
white men involved in lynchings.

00:01:50.576 --> 00:01:52.038
Her bravery paid off.

00:01:52.038 --> 00:01:54.558
Most whites had claimed and 
subsequently reported

00:01:54.558 --> 00:01:57.958
that lynchings were responses to criminal
acts by Black people.

00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.008
But that was not usually the case.

00:02:00.008 --> 00:02:01.218
Through her research,

00:02:01.218 --> 00:02:04.288
Wells showed that these murders 
were actually a deliberate,

00:02:04.288 --> 00:02:09.398
brutal tactic to control or punish 
black people who competed with whites.

00:02:09.398 --> 00:02:10.750
Her friends, for example,

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.700
had been lynched when their grocery store

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.180
became popular enough to divert business 
from a white competitor.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.893
Wells published her findings in 1892.

00:02:19.893 --> 00:02:23.293
In response, a white mob destroyed 
her newspaper presses.

00:02:23.293 --> 00:02:25.053
She was out of town when they struck,

00:02:25.053 --> 00:02:28.493
but they threatened to kill her 
if she ever returned to Memphis.

00:02:28.493 --> 00:02:30.223
So she traveled to New York,

00:02:30.223 --> 00:02:34.263
where that same year she re-published 
her research in a pamphlet titled

00:02:34.263 --> 00:02:38.502
Southern Horrors: Lynch Law 
in All Its Phases.

00:02:38.502 --> 00:02:41.654
In 1895, after settling in Chicago,

00:02:41.654 --> 00:02:46.364
she built on Southern Horrors in a longer 
piece called The Red Record.

00:02:46.364 --> 00:02:48.888
Her careful documentation of the horrors 
of lynching

00:02:48.888 --> 00:02:52.888
and impassioned public speeches 
drew international attention.

00:02:52.888 --> 00:02:55.938
Wells used her newfound fame 
to amplify her message.

00:02:55.938 --> 00:02:57.038
She traveled to Europe,

00:02:57.038 --> 00:03:01.348
where she rallied European outrage against
racial violence in the American South

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:05.498
in hopes that the US government and public
would follow their example.

00:03:05.498 --> 00:03:06.608
Back in the US,

00:03:06.608 --> 00:03:09.508
she didn’t hesitate to confront powerful 
organizations,

00:03:09.508 --> 00:03:11.988
fighting the segregationist 
policies of the YMCA

00:03:11.988 --> 00:03:14.048
and leading a delegation 
to the White House

00:03:14.048 --> 00:03:17.208
to protest discriminatory 
workplace practices.

00:03:17.208 --> 00:03:20.158
She did all this while 
disenfranchised herself.

00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:23.618
Women didn’t win the right to vote 
until Wells was in her late 50s.

00:03:23.618 --> 00:03:27.968
And even then, the vote was primarily 
extended to white women only.

00:03:27.968 --> 00:03:30.929
Wells was a key player in the battle 
for voting inclusion,

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:33.909
starting a Black women’s 
suffrage organization in Chicago.

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:36.479
But in spite of her deep commitment 
to women’s rights,

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:39.219
she clashed with white leaders 
of the movement.

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:42.039
During a march for women’s 
suffrage in Washington D.C.,

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:45.559
she ignored the organizers’ attempt 
to placate Southern bigotry

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:47.409
by placing Black women in the back,

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:50.539
and marched up front alongside
the white women.

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:52.839
She also chafed with other 
civil rights leaders,

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:55.379
who saw her as a dangerous radical.

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:00.019
She insisted on airing, in full detail, 
the atrocities taking place in the South,

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.912
while others thought doing so would be 
counterproductive

00:04:02.912 --> 00:04:05.772
to negotiations with white politicians.

00:04:05.772 --> 00:04:08.862
Although she participated in the founding 
of the NAACP,

00:04:08.862 --> 00:04:11.742
she was soon sidelined 
from the organization.

00:04:11.742 --> 00:04:15.532
Wells’ unwillingness to compromise any 
aspect of her vision of justice

00:04:15.532 --> 00:04:18.822
shined a light on the weak points 
of the various rights movements,

00:04:18.822 --> 00:04:20.692
and ultimately made them stronger—

00:04:20.692 --> 00:04:24.502
but also made it difficult for her 
to find a place within them.

00:04:24.502 --> 00:04:26.142
She was ahead of her time,

00:04:26.142 --> 00:04:29.242
waging a tireless struggle 
for equality and justice

00:04:29.242 --> 00:04:33.242
decades before many had even begun 
to imagine it possible.
