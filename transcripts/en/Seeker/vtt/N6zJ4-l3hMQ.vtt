00:00:01.305 --> 00:00:04.270
DALLAS TAYLOR: Did you know
that there's no sound in space ?

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.400
LORI GLAZE: You don't
have sound in space

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.100
because sound
requires molecules.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.670
You have to be able to move the
molecules with the sound waves.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.990
And without the molecules there,
the sound just doesn't move.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.140
You can try and use your
lungs to push the sound out

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.730
of your mouth, but it
won't travel anywhere.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.110
DALLAS TAYLOR: But there might
be sound on other planets.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.435
We talked with scientists
at NASA's Goddard space

00:00:28.435 --> 00:00:30.310
Flight Center to find
out what it would sound

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.518
like on the surface of Venus.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.720
LORI GLAZE: In my
mind, what sound

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.380
would be like on the surface,
because you have this really

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.920
dense atmosphere, much denser
than Earth's, the sound

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.770
would be more like, or tend
toward what things sound

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.750
like when you're underwater.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.132
If you could imagine something
in between air and water,

00:00:53.132 --> 00:00:55.090
that kind of density,
you're running your hands

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.770
through that, and
you would feel that.

00:01:02.427 --> 00:01:04.260
KEITH NOLL: One thing
we do know about Venus

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.340
is that it has lighting,
so you might hear thunder.

00:01:11.076 --> 00:01:13.830
DALLAS TAYLOR: I wonder what
other things, like my voice

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.140
might sound like.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.690
I'm on Venus, in
this ethereal world

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.630
that's a mix between a
gas-like atmosphere and water.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.710
I'm almost floating.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.410
But yet, it's not as restrictive
as being submerged in water.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.030
My voice, the thunder,
it's all slightly

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.830
muffled and distorted
as it travels

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.160
through the thick atmosphere.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.346
Of course, this is
all just conjecture.

00:01:46.346 --> 00:01:47.720
There's no way to
truly know what

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.250
it would sound like
on other planets

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.550
without recording them with
some sort of microphone.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.710
So what does the future
hold for us to truly

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.020
be able to test our sound
theories on other planets?

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.100
SCOTT GUZEWICH: There's
going to be a microphone

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.960
on the next Mars Rover.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.300
The rover launched
in 2020 is supposed

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.890
to have a microphone on it.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.759
We expect that it'll hear
a few different things.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.290
The sound as the rover
drives across the surface,

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.101
for example, you know,
will be transmitted

00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:17.100
both through the atmosphere
and through the body

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.930
of the rover itself.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.270
You should be able to hear
the wheels kind of crunch

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.900
along on the sand
and on the rocks.

00:02:27.937 --> 00:02:29.770
DALLAS TAYLOR: Who knows
what else this Mars

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.480
Rover might hear?

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.640
For now, we'll just
have to appreciate

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.700
the abundance of sound present
on our very own planet Earth.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.150
This was an excerpt from
the podcast "Twenty Thousand

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.950
Hertz," which
explores the world's

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.800
most recognizable and
interesting sounds.
