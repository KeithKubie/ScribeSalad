hi I'm Chet Haase an engineer on the

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290
hi I'm Chet Haase an engineer on the
 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.100
hi I'm Chet Haase an engineer on the
Android UI toolkit team today I'm going

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110
Android UI toolkit team today I'm going
 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.930
Android UI toolkit team today I'm going
to talk about a new animation feature in

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940
to talk about a new animation feature in
 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.269
to talk about a new animation feature in
the KitKat release it's called

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279
the KitKat release it's called
 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.179
the KitKat release it's called
transitions so the idea with transitions

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189
transitions so the idea with transitions
 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.160
transitions so the idea with transitions
is actually the idea behind a lot of the

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170
is actually the idea behind a lot of the
 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.810
is actually the idea behind a lot of the
stuff that we do which is trying to make

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820
stuff that we do which is trying to make
 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.359
stuff that we do which is trying to make
things easier for you the developers of

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369
things easier for you the developers of
 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.339
things easier for you the developers of
Android applications to get richer

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349
Android applications to get richer
 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.290
Android applications to get richer
experiences for your users hopefully

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300
experiences for your users hopefully
 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.200
experiences for your users hopefully
with less effort transitions it's kind

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210
with less effort transitions it's kind
 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.030
with less effort transitions it's kind
of a simple idea it's basically a way

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040
of a simple idea it's basically a way
 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.060
of a simple idea it's basically a way
for you to describe the different scenes

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070
for you to describe the different scenes
 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.510
for you to describe the different scenes
in your application either beforehand as

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520
in your application either beforehand as
 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.970
in your application either beforehand as
layout resource files or dynamically as

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980
layout resource files or dynamically as
 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.590
layout resource files or dynamically as
things change in the application and

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600
things change in the application and
 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.810
things change in the application and
then use transitions to animate the

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820
then use transitions to animate the
 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.190
then use transitions to animate the
changes no matter what those changes

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200
changes no matter what those changes
 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.319
changes no matter what those changes
were and you can step out of the way and

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329
were and you can step out of the way and
 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.490
were and you can step out of the way and
just let the transitions run

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500
just let the transitions run
 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.139
just let the transitions run
automatically without having to get more

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149
automatically without having to get more
 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.029
automatically without having to get more
involved and run these manual animations

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039
involved and run these manual animations
 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.670
involved and run these manual animations
which are more of the typical model of

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680
which are more of the typical model of
 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.740
which are more of the typical model of
animating things in a UI hopefully at

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750
animating things in a UI hopefully at
 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.119
animating things in a UI hopefully at
the end of the day you get richer

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129
the end of the day you get richer
 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.520
the end of the day you get richer
applications experiences by having more

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530
applications experiences by having more
 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.440
applications experiences by having more
stuff move on the screen in an intuitive

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450
stuff move on the screen in an intuitive
 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.410
stuff move on the screen in an intuitive
way your users get richer experiences

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420
way your users get richer experiences
 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.620
way your users get richer experiences
and they get a better understanding of

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630
and they get a better understanding of
 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.030
and they get a better understanding of
how your application actually works

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040
how your application actually works
 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.890
how your application actually works
because you can transition naturally

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900
because you can transition naturally
 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.510
because you can transition naturally
between these different scenes of your

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520
between these different scenes of your
 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.420
between these different scenes of your
application and and there's more

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430
application and and there's more
 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.070
application and and there's more
animations in the world which I'm always

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080
animations in the world which I'm always
 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.289
animations in the world which I'm always
in favor of okay so let's take a look at

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299
in favor of okay so let's take a look at
 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.870
in favor of okay so let's take a look at
some slides and we'll go over a very

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880
some slides and we'll go over a very
 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.840
some slides and we'll go over a very
quick overview of how the API works what

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850
quick overview of how the API works what
 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.550
quick overview of how the API works what
the different pieces are there's a lot

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560
the different pieces are there's a lot
 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.980
the different pieces are there's a lot
of details that I'm skipping here but

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990
of details that I'm skipping here but
 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.260

also API demos which we'll see a little

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290
also API demos which we'll see a little
 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.130
also API demos which we'll see a little
bit later we'll take a look at some code

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140
bit later we'll take a look at some code
 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.310
bit later we'll take a look at some code
in that okay so first we start out with

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320
in that okay so first we start out with
 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.020
in that okay so first we start out with
the idea of a scene you can think of

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030
the idea of a scene you can think of
 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.600
the idea of a scene you can think of
this as a layout it's basically a view

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610
this as a layout it's basically a view
 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.130
this as a layout it's basically a view
hierarchy that describes what this

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140
hierarchy that describes what this
 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.630
hierarchy that describes what this
particular scene looks like this could

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640
particular scene looks like this could
 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.120
particular scene looks like this could
be the scene of the entire application

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130
be the scene of the entire application
 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.190
be the scene of the entire application
in a particular screen or it could be

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200
in a particular screen or it could be
 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.469
in a particular screen or it could be
some sub hierarchy in this particular

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479
some sub hierarchy in this particular
 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.789
some sub hierarchy in this particular
case the scene describes this situation

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799
case the scene describes this situation
 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.359
case the scene describes this situation
where we have a textview an edit text

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369
where we have a textview an edit text
 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.639
where we have a textview an edit text
and a button fairly simple and then we

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649
and a button fairly simple and then we
 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.140
and a button fairly simple and then we
have another scene that we've described

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150
have another scene that we've described
 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.900
have another scene that we've described
through

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910
through
 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.220
through
with some other layout file we have

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230
with some other layout file we have
 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.380
with some other layout file we have
different text views in there a little

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390
different text views in there a little
 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.170
different text views in there a little
bit richer text longer details there but

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180
bit richer text longer details there but
 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.450
bit richer text longer details there but
we have again an edit text field and a

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460
we have again an edit text field and a
 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.770
we have again an edit text field and a
button and maybe these are shared

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780
button and maybe these are shared
 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.390
button and maybe these are shared
components maybe they moved location

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400
components maybe they moved location
 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.220
components maybe they moved location
possibly change size but they're

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230
possibly change size but they're
 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.900
possibly change size but they're
actually shared between the two scenes

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910
actually shared between the two scenes
 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.790
actually shared between the two scenes
wouldn't it be nice if you could help

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800
wouldn't it be nice if you could help
 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.130
wouldn't it be nice if you could help
the user understand as they move from

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140
the user understand as they move from
 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.690
the user understand as they move from
scene one to scene two in your

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700
scene one to scene two in your
 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.460
scene one to scene two in your
application the changes that it occurred

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470
application the changes that it occurred
 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.890
application the changes that it occurred
by fading things out that go away fading

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900
by fading things out that go away fading
 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.570
by fading things out that go away fading
things in that have come into being and

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580
things in that have come into being and
 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.060
things in that have come into being and
moving and resizing the shared elements

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070
moving and resizing the shared elements
 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.710
moving and resizing the shared elements
between these scenes that's what

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720
between these scenes that's what
 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.510
between these scenes that's what
transitions are about you specify these

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520
transitions are about you specify these
 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.670
transitions are about you specify these
different scenes and then when you go to

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680
different scenes and then when you go to
 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.380
different scenes and then when you go to
a scene the transition automatically

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390
a scene the transition automatically
 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.360
a scene the transition automatically
kicks in and runs the necessary

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370
kicks in and runs the necessary
 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.900
kicks in and runs the necessary
animations in order to to make that

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910
animations in order to to make that
 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.640
animations in order to to make that
change as well as to animate the change

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650
change as well as to animate the change
 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.880
change as well as to animate the change
over time so let's take a look at scenes

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890
over time so let's take a look at scenes
 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.530
over time so let's take a look at scenes
these are the modules that you've

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540
these are the modules that you've
 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.480
these are the modules that you've
defined for your application the

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490
defined for your application the
 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.480
defined for your application the
different screens if you will of states

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490
different screens if you will of states
 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.520
different screens if you will of states
that your application will move through

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530
that your application will move through
 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.310
that your application will move through
over time you can just construct these

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320
over time you can just construct these
 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.950
over time you can just construct these
scenes in different ways first of all

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960
scenes in different ways first of all
 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.580
scenes in different ways first of all
scenes always have a route or a view

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590
scenes always have a route or a view
 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.720
scenes always have a route or a view
group associated with them which is

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730
group associated with them which is
 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.030
group associated with them which is
basically the hierarchy under which the

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040
basically the hierarchy under which the
 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.310
basically the hierarchy under which the
scene lives and in which transitions

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320
scene lives and in which transitions
 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.560
scene lives and in which transitions
will take place so you can construct a

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570
will take place so you can construct a
 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.290
will take place so you can construct a
scene directly with that route and then

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300
scene directly with that route and then
 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.820
scene directly with that route and then
you can set an interaction and whenever

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830
you can set an interaction and whenever
 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.860
you can set an interaction and whenever
that scene is entered you will get a

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870
that scene is entered you will get a
 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.720
that scene is entered you will get a
call back into your runnable and you can

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730
call back into your runnable and you can
 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.130
call back into your runnable and you can
run whatever code you want to make

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140
run whatever code you want to make
 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.170
run whatever code you want to make
whatever manipulations you want to - the

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180
whatever manipulations you want to - the
 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.000
whatever manipulations you want to - the
view hierarchy fairly straight forward a

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010
view hierarchy fairly straight forward a
 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.350
view hierarchy fairly straight forward a
little bit more manual than the other

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360
little bit more manual than the other
 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.390
little bit more manual than the other
ways you can create scenes for example

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400
ways you can create scenes for example
 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.310
ways you can create scenes for example
you can create it from a view group

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320
you can create it from a view group
 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.410
you can create it from a view group
instead let's say you have inflated a

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420
instead let's say you have inflated a
 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.180
instead let's say you have inflated a
hierarchy from some layout ID you have

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190
hierarchy from some layout ID you have
 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.100
hierarchy from some layout ID you have
this view group sitting there you can

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110
this view group sitting there you can
 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.750
this view group sitting there you can
create a scene with that view group so

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760
create a scene with that view group so
 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.100
create a scene with that view group so
you give it basically two view groups

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110
you give it basically two view groups
 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.710
you give it basically two view groups
you can create it with the route of the

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720
you can create it with the route of the
 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.949
you can create it with the route of the
scene hierarchy as well as the route of

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959
scene hierarchy as well as the route of
 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.310
scene hierarchy as well as the route of
the the scene itself so pass that in

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320
the the scene itself so pass that in
 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.470
the the scene itself so pass that in
you've created scene you're good to go

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480
you've created scene you're good to go
 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.690
you've created scene you're good to go
so now when the scene is entered it will

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700
so now when the scene is entered it will
 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.479
so now when the scene is entered it will
simply change the scene to be to be

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489
simply change the scene to be to be
 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.360
simply change the scene to be to be
looking at that that view group instead

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370
looking at that that view group instead
 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.490
looking at that that view group instead
you don't need to tell it what to do to

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500
you don't need to tell it what to do to
 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.140
you don't need to tell it what to do to
manipulate the hierarchy it gets that

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150
manipulate the hierarchy it gets that
 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.820
manipulate the hierarchy it gets that
information from the view group that you

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830
information from the view group that you
 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:20.130
information from the view group that you
passed it in the constructor finally we

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140
passed it in the constructor finally we
 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.390
passed it in the constructor finally we
have something very similar to the last

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400
have something very similar to the last
 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.070
have something very similar to the last
one but instead of handing at a view

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080
one but instead of handing at a view
 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.000
one but instead of handing at a view
group you hand it

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010
group you hand it
 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.370
group you hand it
layout resource ID and when that scene

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380
layout resource ID and when that scene
 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.370
layout resource ID and when that scene
is entered it will inflate the resource

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380
is entered it will inflate the resource
 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.530
is entered it will inflate the resource
and it will go ahead and add that to the

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540
and it will go ahead and add that to the
 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.380
and it will go ahead and add that to the
scene route straightforward

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390
scene route straightforward
 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.560
scene route straightforward
the layout resource also kicks in if you

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570
the layout resource also kicks in if you
 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.690
the layout resource also kicks in if you
create scenes implicitly in resources

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700
create scenes implicitly in resources
 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.790
create scenes implicitly in resources
which we'll see a little bit later you

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800
which we'll see a little bit later you
 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.860
which we'll see a little bit later you
can have a transition manager that

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870
can have a transition manager that
 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.890
can have a transition manager that
automatically inflates scenes implicitly

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900
automatically inflates scenes implicitly
 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.900
automatically inflates scenes implicitly
given layout resource IDs and it uses

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910
given layout resource IDs and it uses
 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.360
given layout resource IDs and it uses
the same mechanism under the hood next

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370
the same mechanism under the hood next
 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.040
the same mechanism under the hood next
we can take a look at transitions these

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050
we can take a look at transitions these
 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.350
we can take a look at transitions these
are the engine responsible for declaring

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360
are the engine responsible for declaring
 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.750
are the engine responsible for declaring
what it is you want to do when things

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760
what it is you want to do when things
 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.340
what it is you want to do when things
change from scene to scene in your

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350
change from scene to scene in your
 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:00.330
change from scene to scene in your
application

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340
application
 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.560
application
so these basically listen for changes

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570
so these basically listen for changes
 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.750
so these basically listen for changes
before and after and compare those

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760
before and after and compare those
 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.520
before and after and compare those
values and then based on changes that

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530
values and then based on changes that
 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.680
values and then based on changes that
occurred to any view in the scene

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690
occurred to any view in the scene
 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.930
occurred to any view in the scene
hierarchy they'll create an animator

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940
hierarchy they'll create an animator
 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.460
hierarchy they'll create an animator
that then gets run to animate those

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470
that then gets run to animate those
 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.890
that then gets run to animate those
changes there's a few different ways to

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900
changes there's a few different ways to
 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.530
changes there's a few different ways to
create transitions you can just create

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540
create transitions you can just create
 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.090
create transitions you can just create
these things directly we have some

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100
these things directly we have some
 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.060
these things directly we have some
defines in the in the framework already

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070
defines in the in the framework already
 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.860
defines in the in the framework already
there's a change bounds which will move

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870
there's a change bounds which will move
 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.660
there's a change bounds which will move
and resize objects that change between

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:27.670
and resize objects that change between
 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.730
and resize objects that change between
scenes there's a fade that will fade

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740
scenes there's a fade that will fade
 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.200
scenes there's a fade that will fade
things in and out according to whether

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210
things in and out according to whether
 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.930
things in and out according to whether
they come or go between scene changes

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940
they come or go between scene changes
 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.470
they come or go between scene changes
and then there's also a transition set

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:36.480
and then there's also a transition set
 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.280
and then there's also a transition set
which is kind of the transition

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:38.290
which is kind of the transition
 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.260
which is kind of the transition
equivalent of animator set it's

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270
equivalent of animator set it's
 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.730
equivalent of animator set it's
basically a group it's a way of

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740
basically a group it's a way of
 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.710
basically a group it's a way of
choreographing several different

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720
choreographing several different
 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.360
choreographing several different
transitions you can create a transition

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370
transitions you can create a transition
 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.670
transitions you can create a transition
set and then tell it to whether for all

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680
set and then tell it to whether for all
 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.440
set and then tell it to whether for all
of its transition children to run those

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450
of its transition children to run those
 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.860
of its transition children to run those
together or sequentially and it can also

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870
together or sequentially and it can also
 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.600
together or sequentially and it can also
be a hierarchy of sets so you can have a

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610
be a hierarchy of sets so you can have a
 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.400
be a hierarchy of sets so you can have a
much more complicated mechanism that

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.410
much more complicated mechanism that
 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.320
much more complicated mechanism that
runs several transitions you know in

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330
runs several transitions you know in
 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.930
runs several transitions you know in
parallel or one after another to get a

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940
parallel or one after another to get a
 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.690
parallel or one after another to get a
more interesting animation experience

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:02.700
more interesting animation experience
 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.090
more interesting animation experience
and finally you can load transitions

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:06.100
and finally you can load transitions
 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.970
and finally you can load transitions
from resource files if that's the way

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:08.980
from resource files if that's the way
 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.170
from resource files if that's the way
you go if you want to run it from

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180
you go if you want to run it from
 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.880
you go if you want to run it from
resources this is that this is how you

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:11.890
resources this is that this is how you
 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:14.160
resources this is that this is how you
can do it you can this one for example

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:14.170
can do it you can this one for example
 

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:15.750
can do it you can this one for example
is a transition set that gets loaded

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:15.760
is a transition set that gets loaded
 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.340
is a transition set that gets loaded
that has two children automatically

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:17.350
that has two children automatically
 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.470
that has two children automatically
added to it to listen for changes in

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:19.480
added to it to listen for changes in
 

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.740
added to it to listen for changes in
visibility as well as size and location

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:21.750
visibility as well as size and location
 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.900
visibility as well as size and location
the resource filed maybe it's not

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:24.910
the resource filed maybe it's not
 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:26.160
the resource filed maybe it's not
something you want to do from code

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:26.170
something you want to do from code
 

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:27.630
something you want to do from code
because you're already in code and you

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:27.640
because you're already in code and you
 

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.920
because you're already in code and you
be it's easy enough to create these

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930
be it's easy enough to create these
 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.620
be it's easy enough to create these
things on the fly on the other hand this

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:31.630
things on the fly on the other hand this
 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:33.390
things on the fly on the other hand this
is the mechanism that is used by

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:33.400
is the mechanism that is used by
 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.000
is the mechanism that is used by
transition manager when in it inflates a

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.010
transition manager when in it inflates a
 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:36.570
transition manager when in it inflates a
graph

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:36.580
graph
 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.559
graph
the information which we'll see soon but

00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:40.569
the information which we'll see soon but
 

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:41.760
the information which we'll see soon but
not on this slide yet

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:41.770
not on this slide yet
 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.529
not on this slide yet
finally there's there's an idea of

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:43.539
finally there's there's an idea of
 

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:45.689
finally there's there's an idea of
custom transitions so we've defined as I

00:06:45.689 --> 00:06:45.699
custom transitions so we've defined as I
 

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:47.520
custom transitions so we've defined as I
said a couple of canonical transitions

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:47.530
said a couple of canonical transitions
 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.760
said a couple of canonical transitions
which which automatic transitions will

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:50.770
which which automatic transitions will
 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.379
which which automatic transitions will
use on-the-fly there's change bounds

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:52.389
use on-the-fly there's change bounds
 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:54.600
use on-the-fly there's change bounds
which moves and resizes views and

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:54.610
which moves and resizes views and
 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:56.610
which moves and resizes views and
there's also fade which deals with

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:56.620
there's also fade which deals with
 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.499
there's also fade which deals with
visibility information fades things in

00:06:58.499 --> 00:06:58.509
visibility information fades things in
 

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:00.270
visibility information fades things in
and out fairly straightforward probably

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:00.280
and out fairly straightforward probably
 

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.550
and out fairly straightforward probably
the behavior you want in most cases but

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:02.560
the behavior you want in most cases but
 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.719
the behavior you want in most cases but
if you want to define your own

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:03.729
if you want to define your own
 

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:06.059
if you want to define your own
transition for example if if when

00:07:06.059 --> 00:07:06.069
transition for example if if when
 

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:07.589
transition for example if if when
something comes into being you didn't

00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:07.599
something comes into being you didn't
 

00:07:07.599 --> 00:07:08.969
something comes into being you didn't
want it to fade in in the middle of the

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:08.979
want it to fade in in the middle of the
 

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:10.379
want it to fade in in the middle of the
screen where it lives but you actually

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:10.389
screen where it lives but you actually
 

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:12.119
screen where it lives but you actually
wanted to slide it in from the right

00:07:12.119 --> 00:07:12.129
wanted to slide it in from the right
 

00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:14.129
wanted to slide it in from the right
then you can write a custom transition

00:07:14.129 --> 00:07:14.139
then you can write a custom transition
 

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:16.230
then you can write a custom transition
you would simply subclass the transition

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:16.240
you would simply subclass the transition
 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.390
you would simply subclass the transition
class itself and then you override the

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400
class itself and then you override the
 

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.339
class itself and then you override the
three methods that do what it is you

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:20.349
three methods that do what it is you
 

00:07:20.349 --> 00:07:22.770
three methods that do what it is you
want to do there's two capture methods

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:22.780
want to do there's two capture methods
 

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.230
want to do there's two capture methods
one captures the values at the start

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:25.240
one captures the values at the start
 

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.019
one captures the values at the start
when the when the application code said

00:07:28.019 --> 00:07:28.029
when the when the application code said
 

00:07:28.029 --> 00:07:30.209
when the when the application code said
okay I'm ready to do a transition that's

00:07:30.209 --> 00:07:30.219
okay I'm ready to do a transition that's
 

00:07:30.219 --> 00:07:31.409
okay I'm ready to do a transition that's
the point at which you would get a call

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:31.419
the point at which you would get a call
 

00:07:31.419 --> 00:07:33.659
the point at which you would get a call
to your capture start values method and

00:07:33.659 --> 00:07:33.669
to your capture start values method and
 

00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:36.240
to your capture start values method and
you would go ahead and just read from

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:36.250
you would go ahead and just read from
 

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:38.999
you would go ahead and just read from
the view objects anything you wanted to

00:07:38.999 --> 00:07:39.009
the view objects anything you wanted to
 

00:07:39.009 --> 00:07:41.159
the view objects anything you wanted to
that affected your transition so you

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:41.169
that affected your transition so you
 

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:44.339
that affected your transition so you
could read the the layout position for

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:44.349
could read the the layout position for
 

00:07:44.349 --> 00:07:46.080
could read the the layout position for
example or the visibility information

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:46.090
example or the visibility information
 

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:47.760
example or the visibility information
that you care about and then you get a

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:47.770
that you care about and then you get a
 

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:49.469
that you care about and then you get a
call to capture n values when the

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:49.479
call to capture n values when the
 

00:07:49.479 --> 00:07:51.269
call to capture n values when the
transaction actually wants to run and

00:07:51.269 --> 00:07:51.279
transaction actually wants to run and
 

00:07:51.279 --> 00:07:53.189
transaction actually wants to run and
when it wants to start and then you

00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:53.199
when it wants to start and then you
 

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:54.990
when it wants to start and then you
finally get a call right after that to

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:55.000
finally get a call right after that to
 

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.379
finally get a call right after that to
the create animator function which can

00:07:58.379 --> 00:07:58.389
the create animator function which can
 

00:07:58.389 --> 00:08:00.329
the create animator function which can
then compare those values and say okay

00:08:00.329 --> 00:08:00.339
then compare those values and say okay
 

00:08:00.339 --> 00:08:02.610
then compare those values and say okay
well this visibility value changed and

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:02.620
well this visibility value changed and
 

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:03.749
well this visibility value changed and
that's something that I care about

00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:03.759
that's something that I care about
 

00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:05.219
that's something that I care about
therefore I'm going to create an

00:08:05.219 --> 00:08:05.229
therefore I'm going to create an
 

00:08:05.229 --> 00:08:06.839
therefore I'm going to create an
animation that does the following you

00:08:06.839 --> 00:08:06.849
animation that does the following you
 

00:08:06.849 --> 00:08:08.129
animation that does the following you
know slides in from the right or

00:08:08.129 --> 00:08:08.139
know slides in from the right or
 

00:08:08.139 --> 00:08:10.260
know slides in from the right or
whatever it is returns that animator and

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:10.270
whatever it is returns that animator and
 

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:12.209
whatever it is returns that animator and
then the transition system runs it so

00:08:12.209 --> 00:08:12.219
then the transition system runs it so
 

00:08:12.219 --> 00:08:14.249
then the transition system runs it so
there's a lot of stuff that we just ship

00:08:14.249 --> 00:08:14.259
there's a lot of stuff that we just ship
 

00:08:14.259 --> 00:08:15.570
there's a lot of stuff that we just ship
with the framework for free and you can

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:15.580
with the framework for free and you can
 

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.450
with the framework for free and you can
simply use implicitly when you're in a

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:18.460
simply use implicitly when you're in a
 

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.680
simply use implicitly when you're in a
transition but if you want to create

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:19.690
transition but if you want to create
 

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:21.719
transition but if you want to create
custom transitions fairly

00:08:21.719 --> 00:08:21.729
custom transitions fairly
 

00:08:21.729 --> 00:08:25.649
custom transitions fairly
straightforward to do that the okay so

00:08:25.649 --> 00:08:25.659
straightforward to do that the okay so
 

00:08:25.659 --> 00:08:26.850
straightforward to do that the okay so
now you've got your scenes you've got

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:26.860
now you've got your scenes you've got
 

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.680
now you've got your scenes you've got
your transitions how do you actually

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:28.690
your transitions how do you actually
 

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:30.119
your transitions how do you actually
change scenes how do you go from one

00:08:30.119 --> 00:08:30.129
change scenes how do you go from one
 

00:08:30.129 --> 00:08:32.399
change scenes how do you go from one
scene to another you could just enter a

00:08:32.399 --> 00:08:32.409
scene to another you could just enter a
 

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:34.469
scene to another you could just enter a
scene there's no transition involved

00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:34.479
scene there's no transition involved
 

00:08:34.479 --> 00:08:35.399
scene there's no transition involved
there you're basically just saying

00:08:35.399 --> 00:08:35.409
there you're basically just saying
 

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:37.230
there you're basically just saying
here's the scene I want you to load and

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:37.240
here's the scene I want you to load and
 

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.029
here's the scene I want you to load and
it will do that it will run the code

00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:39.039
it will do that it will run the code
 

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:40.850
it will do that it will run the code
that was in your runnable it will

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:40.860
that was in your runnable it will
 

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.350
that was in your runnable it will
inflate the the layout resource file

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:43.360
inflate the the layout resource file
 

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.939
inflate the the layout resource file
that you gave it whatever it'll enter

00:08:44.939 --> 00:08:44.949
that you gave it whatever it'll enter
 

00:08:44.949 --> 00:08:46.829
that you gave it whatever it'll enter
the scene nothing much going on there

00:08:46.829 --> 00:08:46.839
the scene nothing much going on there
 

00:08:46.839 --> 00:08:49.430
the scene nothing much going on there
certainly no interesting animations or

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:49.440
certainly no interesting animations or
 

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.260
certainly no interesting animations or
you can tell the transition manager to

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:52.270
you can tell the transition manager to
 

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:55.019
you can tell the transition manager to
go to a scene and in the process of

00:08:55.019 --> 00:08:55.029
go to a scene and in the process of
 

00:08:55.029 --> 00:08:56.819
go to a scene and in the process of
doing that it will use a default

00:08:56.819 --> 00:08:56.829
doing that it will use a default
 

00:08:56.829 --> 00:08:58.740
doing that it will use a default
transition along the way it'll say okay

00:08:58.740 --> 00:08:58.750
transition along the way it'll say okay
 

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:00.059
transition along the way it'll say okay
I'm going to change into the scene and

00:09:00.059 --> 00:09:00.069
I'm going to change into the scene and
 

00:09:00.069 --> 00:09:01.980
I'm going to change into the scene and
in the meantime I'm going to capture

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:01.990
in the meantime I'm going to capture
 

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:04.170
in the meantime I'm going to capture
start values capture end values and run

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:04.180
start values capture end values and run
 

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:07.319
start values capture end values and run
the default transition for the system or

00:09:07.319 --> 00:09:07.329
the default transition for the system or
 

00:09:07.329 --> 00:09:09.120
the default transition for the system or
you can run it with a custom transition

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:09.130
you can run it with a custom transition
 

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:10.559
you can run it with a custom transition
you can say okay I've defined this

00:09:10.559 --> 00:09:10.569
you can say okay I've defined this
 

00:09:10.569 --> 00:09:12.110
you can say okay I've defined this
lovely transition that I want to use

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:12.120
lovely transition that I want to use
 

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.269
lovely transition that I want to use
when I'm going between this particular

00:09:15.269 --> 00:09:15.279
when I'm going between this particular
 

00:09:15.279 --> 00:09:18.000
when I'm going between this particular
scene combination and now go ahead and

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:18.010
scene combination and now go ahead and
 

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:21.740
scene combination and now go ahead and
transition using one of the one of the

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:21.750
transition using one of the one of the
 

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:24.240
transition using one of the one of the
one of the transition two or the go

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:24.250
one of the transition two or the go
 

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:26.340
one of the transition two or the go
methods in the transition manager and it

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:26.350
methods in the transition manager and it
 

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:28.980
methods in the transition manager and it
will actually load that new scene and

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:28.990
will actually load that new scene and
 

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:30.480
will actually load that new scene and
then run your custom transition along

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:30.490
then run your custom transition along
 

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:33.809
then run your custom transition along
the way before we get this transition

00:09:33.809 --> 00:09:33.819
the way before we get this transition
 

00:09:33.819 --> 00:09:34.949
the way before we get this transition
simplified there's one other thing that

00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:34.959
simplified there's one other thing that
 

00:09:34.959 --> 00:09:36.120
simplified there's one other thing that
I haven't mentioned here which is the

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:36.130
I haven't mentioned here which is the
 

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:38.400
I haven't mentioned here which is the
idea of a transition manager you'll

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:38.410
idea of a transition manager you'll
 

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:40.319
idea of a transition manager you'll
usually use this just for a one-off

00:09:40.319 --> 00:09:40.329
usually use this just for a one-off
 

00:09:40.329 --> 00:09:41.939
usually use this just for a one-off
thing where you say transition manager I

00:09:41.939 --> 00:09:41.949
thing where you say transition manager I
 

00:09:41.949 --> 00:09:43.949
thing where you say transition manager I
want to go to this scene and use my

00:09:43.949 --> 00:09:43.959
want to go to this scene and use my
 

00:09:43.959 --> 00:09:45.900
want to go to this scene and use my
custom transition here the other thing

custom transition here the other thing
 

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:47.519
custom transition here the other thing
that it can do is keep a whole graph of

00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:47.529
that it can do is keep a whole graph of
 

00:09:47.529 --> 00:09:49.230
that it can do is keep a whole graph of
information about all the transition

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:49.240
information about all the transition
 

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.269
information about all the transition
combinations that you want for all the

00:09:51.269 --> 00:09:51.279
combinations that you want for all the
 

00:09:51.279 --> 00:09:52.889
combinations that you want for all the
scene combinations that you have in your

00:09:52.889 --> 00:09:52.899
scene combinations that you have in your
 

00:09:52.899 --> 00:09:54.269
scene combinations that you have in your
application we'll see a little bit of

00:09:54.269 --> 00:09:54.279
application we'll see a little bit of
 

00:09:54.279 --> 00:09:56.880
application we'll see a little bit of
that in the demo later but I did want to

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:56.890
that in the demo later but I did want to
 

00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:58.800
that in the demo later but I did want to
point out one final thing here on this

00:09:58.800 --> 00:09:58.810
point out one final thing here on this
 

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:01.139
point out one final thing here on this
on this last exciting slide is that you

00:10:01.139 --> 00:10:01.149
on this last exciting slide is that you
 

00:10:01.149 --> 00:10:02.460
on this last exciting slide is that you
know with all this information all these

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:02.470
know with all this information all these
 

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:04.199
know with all this information all these
different classes to think about and

00:10:04.199 --> 00:10:04.209
different classes to think about and
 

00:10:04.209 --> 00:10:05.160
different classes to think about and
you've got scenes and you got

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:05.170
you've got scenes and you got
 

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:08.280
you've got scenes and you got
transitions but but really the idea is

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:08.290
transitions but but really the idea is
 

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:10.139
transitions but but really the idea is
to make animations simpler for most

00:10:10.139 --> 00:10:10.149
to make animations simpler for most
 

00:10:10.149 --> 00:10:13.290
to make animations simpler for most
development cases so in general the only

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:13.300
development cases so in general the only
 

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.730
development cases so in general the only
method that you probably are going to

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:14.740
method that you probably are going to
 

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.920
method that you probably are going to
care about is this one called transition

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:16.930
care about is this one called transition
 

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:18.900
care about is this one called transition
manager begin delayed transition and

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:18.910
manager begin delayed transition and
 

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:20.760
manager begin delayed transition and
then give it the scene route that you

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:20.770
then give it the scene route that you
 

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:22.439
then give it the scene route that you
want to run the transition on what that

00:10:22.439 --> 00:10:22.449
want to run the transition on what that
 

00:10:22.449 --> 00:10:25.590
want to run the transition on what that
does is kicks in all of the process that

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:25.600
does is kicks in all of the process that
 

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.990
does is kicks in all of the process that
is going to capture the current values

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:28.000
is going to capture the current values
 

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.780
is going to capture the current values
and then it's going to spawn a layout

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:30.790
and then it's going to spawn a layout
 

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:32.699
and then it's going to spawn a layout
and rendering run and then in the middle

00:10:32.699 --> 00:10:32.709
and rendering run and then in the middle
 

00:10:32.709 --> 00:10:34.650
and rendering run and then in the middle
of that frame it's going to capture the

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:34.660
of that frame it's going to capture the
 

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.240
of that frame it's going to capture the
end values figure out where things are

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:36.250
end values figure out where things are
 

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:38.130
end values figure out where things are
and then run an automatic transition for

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:38.140
and then run an automatic transition for
 

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.500
and then run an automatic transition for
you in most cases this is all that you

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:40.510
you in most cases this is all that you
 

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:43.319
you in most cases this is all that you
actually care about I it's basically a

00:10:43.319 --> 00:10:43.329
actually care about I it's basically a
 

00:10:43.329 --> 00:10:45.059
actually care about I it's basically a
dynamic change you can think of this as

00:10:45.059 --> 00:10:45.069
dynamic change you can think of this as
 

00:10:45.069 --> 00:10:47.699
dynamic change you can think of this as
creating and animating a dynamic scene

00:10:47.699 --> 00:10:47.709
creating and animating a dynamic scene
 

00:10:47.709 --> 00:10:49.530
creating and animating a dynamic scene
so instead of having these pre baked

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:49.540
so instead of having these pre baked
 

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:51.900
so instead of having these pre baked
scenes from layout resource IDs you can

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:51.910
scenes from layout resource IDs you can
 

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:53.460
scenes from layout resource IDs you can
basically say okay I want you to run a

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:53.470
basically say okay I want you to run a
 

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:56.519
basically say okay I want you to run a
transition so get ready and then in the

00:10:56.519 --> 00:10:56.529
transition so get ready and then in the
 

00:10:56.529 --> 00:10:57.780
transition so get ready and then in the
meantime I'm going to make a bunch of

00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:57.790
meantime I'm going to make a bunch of
 

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:59.400
meantime I'm going to make a bunch of
changes and then by the time those

00:10:59.400 --> 00:10:59.410
changes and then by the time those
 

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:01.410
changes and then by the time those
changes have actually kicked in measure

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:01.420
changes have actually kicked in measure
 

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:02.790
changes have actually kicked in measure
and layout has run

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:02.800
and layout has run
 

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.530
and layout has run
and the system is ready to draw the new

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:04.540
and the system is ready to draw the new
 

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:07.139
and the system is ready to draw the new
frame then the transitions kick in

00:11:07.139 --> 00:11:07.149
frame then the transitions kick in
 

00:11:07.149 --> 00:11:08.910
frame then the transitions kick in
figure out the deltas figure out the

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:08.920
figure out the deltas figure out the
 

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.889
figure out the deltas figure out the
changes and create the animations and

00:11:10.889 --> 00:11:10.899
changes and create the animations and
 

00:11:10.899 --> 00:11:12.840
changes and create the animations and
start the animations running fairly

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:12.850
start the animations running fairly
 

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:16.290
start the animations running fairly
straightforward one line of code nice ok

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:16.300
straightforward one line of code nice ok
 

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:19.100
straightforward one line of code nice ok
so now let's take a quick look at a demo

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:19.110
so now let's take a quick look at a demo
 

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:24.720
so now let's take a quick look at a demo
and this is one of the API demos that

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:24.730
and this is one of the API demos that
 

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:26.639
and this is one of the API demos that
ships with KitKat so you I would

00:11:26.639 --> 00:11:26.649
ships with KitKat so you I would
 

00:11:26.649 --> 00:11:28.019
ships with KitKat so you I would
encourage you to download this from the

00:11:28.019 --> 00:11:28.029
encourage you to download this from the
 

00:11:28.029 --> 00:11:29.610
encourage you to download this from the
samples and you can run this and play

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:29.620
samples and you can run this and play
 

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:30.810
samples and you can run this and play
with it to your heart's content

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:30.820
with it to your heart's content
 

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.120
with it to your heart's content
totally complicated an interesting demo

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:33.130
totally complicated an interesting demo
 

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:36.870
totally complicated an interesting demo
so we defined four scenes here and the

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:36.880
so we defined four scenes here and the
 

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:40.590
so we defined four scenes here and the
scenes use custom views so no particular

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:40.600
scenes use custom views so no particular
 

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.060
scenes use custom views so no particular
reason why these could be buttons I

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:42.070
reason why these could be buttons I
 

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:43.530
reason why these could be buttons I
happen to make them colored rectangles

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:43.540
happen to make them colored rectangles
 

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.630
happen to make them colored rectangles
instead so as we change between the

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:45.640
instead so as we change between the
 

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.490
instead so as we change between the
scenes you can see we're resizing we're

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:47.500
scenes you can see we're resizing we're
 

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.100
scenes you can see we're resizing we're
repositioning these things and we can

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:50.110
repositioning these things and we can
 

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:52.350
repositioning these things and we can
just change on the fly we're cancelling

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:52.360
just change on the fly we're cancelling
 

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.660
just change on the fly we're cancelling
we're interrupting we're running other

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:54.670
we're interrupting we're running other
 

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:57.829
we're interrupting we're running other
transitions so fairly straightforward

00:11:57.829 --> 00:11:57.839
transitions so fairly straightforward
 

00:11:57.839 --> 00:12:00.420
transitions so fairly straightforward
now let's take a look at the code for

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:00.430
now let's take a look at the code for
 

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:03.449
now let's take a look at the code for
that demo so there's a few different

00:12:03.449 --> 00:12:03.459
that demo so there's a few different
 

00:12:03.459 --> 00:12:04.800
that demo so there's a few different
pieces here first there's some layout

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:04.810
pieces here first there's some layout
 

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:06.990
pieces here first there's some layout
files so we have transitions scene 1

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:07.000
files so we have transitions scene 1
 

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.170
files so we have transitions scene 1
this just has a layout and it has 4

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:10.180
this just has a layout and it has 4
 

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.550
this just has a layout and it has 4
views inside their position

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:11.560
views inside their position
 

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.829
views inside their position
appropriately transition to scene 2

00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839
appropriately transition to scene 2
 

00:12:13.839 --> 00:12:16.829
appropriately transition to scene 2
looks very similar to that it's just

00:12:16.829 --> 00:12:16.839
looks very similar to that it's just
 

00:12:16.839 --> 00:12:18.540
looks very similar to that it's just
different sizes and different positions

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:18.550
different sizes and different positions
 

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:20.519
different sizes and different positions
for the colored rectangles transition 3

00:12:20.519 --> 00:12:20.529
for the colored rectangles transition 3
 

00:12:20.529 --> 00:12:24.090
for the colored rectangles transition 3
adds the complication of also having

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:24.100
adds the complication of also having
 

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.769
adds the complication of also having
those grayscale custom views in the

00:12:25.769 --> 00:12:25.779
those grayscale custom views in the
 

00:12:25.779 --> 00:12:28.680
those grayscale custom views in the
middle there so nothing really

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:28.690
middle there so nothing really
 

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:29.940
middle there so nothing really
interesting going on in the layout

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:29.950
interesting going on in the layout
 

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:31.800
interesting going on in the layout
resource files but you'll see them

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:31.810
resource files but you'll see them
 

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:34.650
resource files but you'll see them
referred to later in the resources that

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:34.660
referred to later in the resources that
 

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.019
referred to later in the resources that
we inflate for the transition manager we

00:12:37.019 --> 00:12:37.029
we inflate for the transition manager we
 

00:12:37.029 --> 00:12:39.210
we inflate for the transition manager we
have some custom transition that we have

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:39.220
have some custom transition that we have
 

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:42.030
have some custom transition that we have
defined this is simply a change bounds

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:42.040
defined this is simply a change bounds
 

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:43.410
defined this is simply a change bounds
nothing really interesting here it's

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:43.420
nothing really interesting here it's
 

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:44.760
nothing really interesting here it's
just the standard change bounds that

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:44.770
just the standard change bounds that
 

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:46.949
just the standard change bounds that
we're going to run but we refer to this

00:12:46.949 --> 00:12:46.959
we're going to run but we refer to this
 

00:12:46.959 --> 00:12:48.689
we're going to run but we refer to this
resource later when we inflate the

00:12:48.689 --> 00:12:48.699
resource later when we inflate the
 

00:12:48.699 --> 00:12:51.360
resource later when we inflate the
transition manager here's a little bit

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:51.370
transition manager here's a little bit
 

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:53.490
transition manager here's a little bit
more interesting one this is a

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:53.500
more interesting one this is a
 

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.280
more interesting one this is a
transition set it's going to run in the

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:56.290
transition set it's going to run in the
 

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:59.370
transition set it's going to run in the
default mode where all the transitions

00:12:59.370 --> 00:12:59.380
default mode where all the transitions
 

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.050
default mode where all the transitions
run in parallel it's going to run a

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:01.060
run in parallel it's going to run a
 

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.269
run in parallel it's going to run a
change bounds at the same times it's

00:13:03.269 --> 00:13:03.279
change bounds at the same times it's
 

00:13:03.279 --> 00:13:05.759
change bounds at the same times it's
going to run a fade transition and the

00:13:05.759 --> 00:13:05.769
going to run a fade transition and the
 

00:13:05.769 --> 00:13:07.259
going to run a fade transition and the
fade is going to be targeted at a

00:13:07.259 --> 00:13:07.269
fade is going to be targeted at a
 

00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:10.019
fade is going to be targeted at a
specific view and we use IDs to

00:13:10.019 --> 00:13:10.029
specific view and we use IDs to
 

00:13:10.029 --> 00:13:14.550
specific view and we use IDs to
associate with views and so that means

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:14.560
associate with views and so that means
 

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.110
associate with views and so that means
the fade is not generally applied to

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:16.120
the fade is not generally applied to
 

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:16.690
the fade is not generally applied to
everything

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:16.700
everything
 

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.100
everything
on the screen but we're saying hey I

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:18.110
on the screen but we're saying hey I
 

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:19.780
on the screen but we're saying hey I
want you to run this specific transition

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:19.790
want you to run this specific transition
 

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:22.180
want you to run this specific transition
on this specific view in the hierarchy

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:22.190
on this specific view in the hierarchy
 

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:25.120
on this specific view in the hierarchy
fade-out is very similar although in

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:25.130
fade-out is very similar although in
 

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:26.170
fade-out is very similar although in
this case it's going to run the

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:26.180
this case it's going to run the
 

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.180
this case it's going to run the
transition sequentially so he's going to

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:28.190
transition sequentially so he's going to
 

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:30.040
transition sequentially so he's going to
run the change bounds on any things that

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:30.050
run the change bounds on any things that
 

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:32.260
run the change bounds on any things that
change position in size and after that's

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:32.270
change position in size and after that's
 

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:35.530
change position in size and after that's
done it's going to run the fade and then

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:35.540
done it's going to run the fade and then
 

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:37.180
done it's going to run the fade and then
finally we have a transition manager

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:37.190
finally we have a transition manager
 

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:38.590
finally we have a transition manager
which we haven't really seen yet this is

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:38.600
which we haven't really seen yet this is
 

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.020
which we haven't really seen yet this is
the the object that keeps a graph of

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:41.030
the the object that keeps a graph of
 

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:43.360
the the object that keeps a graph of
what you want to happen as you go from

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:43.370
what you want to happen as you go from
 

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:45.070
what you want to happen as you go from
scene to scene in your application you

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:45.080
scene to scene in your application you
 

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.920
scene to scene in your application you
can define here I mean if if you don't

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:47.930
can define here I mean if if you don't
 

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:50.050
can define here I mean if if you don't
need any custom transitions then you

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:50.060
need any custom transitions then you
 

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:51.640
need any custom transitions then you
wouldn't care about transition manager

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:51.650
wouldn't care about transition manager
 

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:53.500
wouldn't care about transition manager
you would just run transitions but if

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:53.510
you would just run transitions but if
 

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:54.970
you would just run transitions but if
you care that when you go from scene one

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:54.980
you care that when you go from scene one
 

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:57.490
you care that when you go from scene one
- same - you want this particular custom

00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:57.500
- same - you want this particular custom
 

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.740
- same - you want this particular custom
transition but from scene due to scene 3

00:13:59.740 --> 00:13:59.750
transition but from scene due to scene 3
 

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:01.390
transition but from scene due to scene 3
you want a different one this is how you

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:01.400
you want a different one this is how you
 

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.370
you want a different one this is how you
would define it at least in resource

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:03.380
would define it at least in resource
 

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.410
would define it at least in resource
files so you create a transition manager

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:05.420
files so you create a transition manager
 

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:06.910
files so you create a transition manager
and then you have several transition

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:06.920
and then you have several transition
 

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.980
and then you have several transition
objects that define the interaction that

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:08.990
objects that define the interaction that
 

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:10.300
objects that define the interaction that
you want in any of these particular

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:10.310
you want in any of these particular
 

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:13.300
you want in any of these particular
scenes scene changes so we have a from

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:13.310
scenes scene changes so we have a from
 

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:15.310
scenes scene changes so we have a from
scene that refers to a layout file and

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:15.320
scene that refers to a layout file and
 

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.930
scene that refers to a layout file and
that's implicitly going to inflate that

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:16.940
that's implicitly going to inflate that
 

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.510
that's implicitly going to inflate that
layout resource file and create a scene

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:19.520
layout resource file and create a scene
 

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.730
layout resource file and create a scene
out of it we have a two scene same thing

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:21.740
out of it we have a two scene same thing
 

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:23.700
out of it we have a two scene same thing
it's going to create a scene from that

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:23.710
it's going to create a scene from that
 

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:25.630
it's going to create a scene from that
layout file and then we have the

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:25.640
layout file and then we have the
 

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.520
layout file and then we have the
transition that it's going to refer to

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:27.530
transition that it's going to refer to
 

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:30.310
transition that it's going to refer to
in another transition resource file like

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:30.320
in another transition resource file like
 

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.680
in another transition resource file like
the ones that we just looked at so

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:32.690
the ones that we just looked at so
 

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:34.120
the ones that we just looked at so
that's all the resource stuff now let's

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:34.130
that's all the resource stuff now let's
 

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:36.340
that's all the resource stuff now let's
look at the code which is in transitions

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:36.350
look at the code which is in transitions
 

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:39.340
look at the code which is in transitions
Java and in the API demos you'll see

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:39.350
Java and in the API demos you'll see
 

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:42.820
Java and in the API demos you'll see
this in the animations directory and

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:42.830
this in the animations directory and
 

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:45.910
this in the animations directory and
it's called simple transitions and here

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:45.920
it's called simple transitions and here
 

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:48.520
it's called simple transitions and here
it is not a lot of code going on here we

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:48.530
it is not a lot of code going on here we
 

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:50.980
it is not a lot of code going on here we
inflate the transition manager well we

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:50.990
inflate the transition manager well we
 

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:53.680
inflate the transition manager well we
get the transition inflator and then we

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:53.690
get the transition inflator and then we
 

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:55.690
get the transition inflator and then we
inflate the transition manager down here

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:55.700
inflate the transition manager down here
 

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.730
inflate the transition manager down here
and we also create three scenes along

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:57.740
and we also create three scenes along
 

00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:59.770
and we also create three scenes along
the way and you'll note we're only

00:14:59.770 --> 00:14:59.780
the way and you'll note we're only
 

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:01.480
the way and you'll note we're only
creating three scenes but there were

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:01.490
creating three scenes but there were
 

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:03.250
creating three scenes but there were
actually four in the demo and we'll show

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:03.260
actually four in the demo and we'll show
 

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:04.060
actually four in the demo and we'll show
why in a minute

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:04.070
why in a minute
 

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.830
why in a minute
the only reason that we need the scenes

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:05.840
the only reason that we need the scenes
 

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:09.130
the only reason that we need the scenes
in the in the code here is that this is

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:09.140
in the in the code here is that this is
 

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:10.870
in the in the code here is that this is
where we specify that we're going to

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:10.880
where we specify that we're going to
 

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.240
where we specify that we're going to
transition to a particular scene we've

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:13.250
transition to a particular scene we've
 

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:14.890
transition to a particular scene we've
already told the transition manager what

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:14.900
already told the transition manager what
 

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:16.600
already told the transition manager what
transitions to run as we go scene to

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:16.610
transitions to run as we go scene to
 

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:19.090
transitions to run as we go scene to
scene and here we're actually getting a

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:19.100
scene and here we're actually getting a
 

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:21.160
scene and here we're actually getting a
reference to those scenes and saying ok

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:21.170
reference to those scenes and saying ok
 

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:23.230
reference to those scenes and saying ok
now I want to move to scene 1 scene to

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:23.240
now I want to move to scene 1 scene to
 

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.780
now I want to move to scene 1 scene to
scene 3 and we do that down here when we

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:25.790
scene 3 and we do that down here when we
 

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:27.160
scene 3 and we do that down here when we
click on the radio button and the demo

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:27.170
click on the radio button and the demo
 

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:29.440
click on the radio button and the demo
we get a call to one of these items and

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:29.450
we get a call to one of these items and
 

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:30.350
we get a call to one of these items and
we say ok Tran

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:30.360
we say ok Tran
 

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.329
we say ok Tran
in manager I want you to transition to

00:15:32.329 --> 00:15:32.339
in manager I want you to transition to
 

00:15:32.339 --> 00:15:34.940
in manager I want you to transition to
the next scene and it'll go it'll load

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:34.950
the next scene and it'll go it'll load
 

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:36.410
the next scene and it'll go it'll load
the scene it will figure out the changes

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:36.420
the scene it will figure out the changes
 

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:38.660
the scene it will figure out the changes
and run the transition that we specified

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:38.670
and run the transition that we specified
 

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:40.910
and run the transition that we specified
in the transition manager resource file

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:40.920
in the transition manager resource file
 

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.980
in the transition manager resource file
that we saw finally there is a fourth

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:42.990
that we saw finally there is a fourth
 

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:44.660
that we saw finally there is a fourth
scene in there that has nothing to do

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:44.670
scene in there that has nothing to do
 

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:46.130
scene in there that has nothing to do
with these scene objects that we

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:46.140
with these scene objects that we
 

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:48.740
with these scene objects that we
inflated but instead this is what I

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:48.750
inflated but instead this is what I
 

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:50.960
inflated but instead this is what I
referred to before as a dynamic scene

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:50.970
referred to before as a dynamic scene
 

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:52.610
referred to before as a dynamic scene
because we're basically changing the

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:52.620
because we're basically changing the
 

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:54.920
because we're basically changing the
view hierarchy on-the-fly and having the

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:54.930
view hierarchy on-the-fly and having the
 

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:56.870
view hierarchy on-the-fly and having the
transition manager or the transition

transition manager or the transition
 

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.280
transition manager or the transition
system in general basically

00:15:58.280 --> 00:15:58.290
system in general basically
 

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:00.079
system in general basically
automatically animate all the changes

00:16:00.079 --> 00:16:00.089
automatically animate all the changes
 

00:16:00.089 --> 00:16:02.030
automatically animate all the changes
there we call the magic method called

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:02.040
there we call the magic method called
 

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.100
there we call the magic method called
but--can delayed transition we handed a

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:04.110
but--can delayed transition we handed a
 

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:05.630
but--can delayed transition we handed a
scene route that we're going to operate

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:05.640
scene route that we're going to operate
 

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.970
scene route that we're going to operate
on we call this helper method called set

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:07.980
on we call this helper method called set
 

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:10.340
on we call this helper method called set
new size and basically we make arbitrary

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:10.350
new size and basically we make arbitrary
 

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:13.040
new size and basically we make arbitrary
changes inside the view hierarchy this

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:13.050
changes inside the view hierarchy this
 

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:14.810
changes inside the view hierarchy this
comes in here it set some new layout

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:14.820
comes in here it set some new layout
 

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:17.300
comes in here it set some new layout
parameters on the views this will spawn

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:17.310
parameters on the views this will spawn
 

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:19.970
parameters on the views this will spawn
a request layout internally things

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:19.980
a request layout internally things
 

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:22.550
a request layout internally things
inside the the scene route will end up

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560
inside the the scene route will end up
 

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.199
inside the the scene route will end up
being relayed out and be rendered and

saw in the demo things move around

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:32.130

I anticipate it will be worked on more

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:44.220
I anticipate it will be worked on more
 

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:45.650
I anticipate it will be worked on more
as time goes on it's fairly

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:45.660
as time goes on it's fairly
 

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:47.600

straightforward and simple for now and

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:47.610
straightforward and simple for now and
 

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:50.060
straightforward and simple for now and
hopefully more importantly simple for

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:50.070
hopefully more importantly simple for
 

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:52.490
hopefully more importantly simple for
you to use to make richer Android

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:52.500
you to use to make richer Android
 

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:55.760
you to use to make richer Android
applications thanks
