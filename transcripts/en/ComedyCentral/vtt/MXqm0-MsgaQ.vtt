00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.500
I wanna meet the
people risking everything.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.450
You ever been on camera?

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:04.750
It's like high school all over again.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:05.740
And see just how far

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.193
they will go for their cause.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.790
What can people like me do

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.410
to help out a situation like this?

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:12.243
Listen.

00:00:12.243 --> 00:00:13.390
Say that again.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:14.223
Listen.

00:00:14.223 --> 00:00:15.056
Listen, okay.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.680
We're tryin' to deal

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.870
with our PTSD in a positive way.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.330
This is therapy.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.200
How 'bout a book club?

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.500
This is safer than war.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.600
That is fair.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.151
You're going
to see this courage

00:00:31.151 --> 00:00:33.553
of people puttin' their body on the line.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.140
We just capsized.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.490
I used to be behind a desk.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.760
Just feels like we
should be more empathetic

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.160
to those people who have made the choice

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.760
to serve for this country.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.050
But, tough titties?

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.950
Yeah, tough titties.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.494
Cold.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.720
I don't look at you
and see you as oppressed.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.130
When you
have to get permission

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.240
to exercise a right --

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.390
That's oppression.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.670
Georgia is by far
the worst state to live in

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.610
if you're undocumented.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.840
So, we're number one.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:06.870
In discrimination.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.470
You might wanna leave that off.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.340
Maybe this is where I belong.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.393
I've been told
I have a face for radio.

00:01:12.393 --> 00:01:13.226
- You do.

00:01:13.226 --> 00:01:14.939
With people
willing to risk everything.

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:15.868
You guys are under arrest

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.013
We're getting arrested.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.260
Is there any way to stand beside you,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.240
but courageously sit down
a little bit in the back?

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.470
Haha, no, no.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.121
No.
