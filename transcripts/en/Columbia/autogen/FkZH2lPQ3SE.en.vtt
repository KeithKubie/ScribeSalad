00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.690
 
okay now so here's an example take a

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700
okay now so here's an example take a
 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.110
okay now so here's an example take a
derivative of x cubed minus 10x squared

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120
derivative of x cubed minus 10x squared
 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.290
derivative of x cubed minus 10x squared
plus 40x that's going to be 3x squared

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300
plus 40x that's going to be 3x squared
 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.170
plus 40x that's going to be 3x squared
you put the tree in front and you reduce

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180
you put the tree in front and you reduce
 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.490
you put the tree in front and you reduce
the power of X by 1 and here it's going

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500
the power of X by 1 and here it's going
 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.109
the power of X by 1 and here it's going
to be minus 20 that's you take the two

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119
to be minus 20 that's you take the two
 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.569
to be minus 20 that's you take the two
and you x minus 10 so that's minus 20 x

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579
and you x minus 10 so that's minus 20 x
 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.930
and you x minus 10 so that's minus 20 x
to the power of one and that's just

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940
to the power of one and that's just
 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.090
to the power of one and that's just
going to be plus 40 okay so you've got

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100
going to be plus 40 okay so you've got
 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.720
going to be plus 40 okay so you've got
three x squared minus 20x plus 40 okay

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730
 
 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:54.860
 
okay okay so so let's talk a little bit

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870
okay okay so so let's talk a little bit
 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:02.139
okay okay so so let's talk a little bit
about interpretation here you have a

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149
about interpretation here you have a
 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:16.550
about interpretation here you have a
polynomial to order three okay and so

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560
polynomial to order three okay and so
 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.330
polynomial to order three okay and so
Kathy asked me a question in the break

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340
Kathy asked me a question in the break
 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.060
Kathy asked me a question in the break
about how I ended up with a

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070
about how I ended up with a
 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.460
about how I ended up with a
weird-looking cost function based on

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470
weird-looking cost function based on
 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.160
weird-looking cost function based on
some cost function that I had put up

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170
some cost function that I had put up
 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.950
some cost function that I had put up
okay and so I just want you to get a

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960
okay and so I just want you to get a
 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.160
okay and so I just want you to get a
sense of the rules that i was using

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170
sense of the rules that i was using
 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.080
sense of the rules that i was using
because it's sort of rules of thumb but

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090
because it's sort of rules of thumb but
 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.520
because it's sort of rules of thumb but
you'll find them useful okay now and and

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530
you'll find them useful okay now and and
 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.590
you'll find them useful okay now and and
i'm only speaking about it relatively

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600
i'm only speaking about it relatively
 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.929
i'm only speaking about it relatively
quickly here but in the the website

where there are detailed notes on all of

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439
where there are detailed notes on all of
 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.070
where there are detailed notes on all of
this you'll find a section on different

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080
this you'll find a section on different
 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.400
this you'll find a section on different
kinds of non-linear

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410
kinds of non-linear
 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.970
kinds of non-linear
functions and one of those will be

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980
functions and one of those will be
 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.780
functions and one of those will be
polynomials of order to order three and

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790
polynomials of order to order three and
 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.520
polynomials of order to order three and
so on and there you'll see some graphs

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530
so on and there you'll see some graphs
 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.830
so on and there you'll see some graphs
so you can follow up further on it but

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840
so you can follow up further on it but
 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:35.180
so you can follow up further on it but
in particular a a polynomial of order

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190
in particular a a polynomial of order
 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:42.870
in particular a a polynomial of order
one is usual is a linear function okay

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880
one is usual is a linear function okay
 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.080
one is usual is a linear function okay
that for example 2x plus 1 that may not

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090
that for example 2x plus 1 that may not
 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.640
that for example 2x plus 1 that may not
be quite right in fact this is probably

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650
be quite right in fact this is probably
 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:59.550
be quite right in fact this is probably
2x minus 1 right ok that's a polynomial

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560
2x minus 1 right ok that's a polynomial
 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:13.430
2x minus 1 right ok that's a polynomial
of order 1 a polynomial of order to

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440
of order 1 a polynomial of order to
 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:28.210
of order 1 a polynomial of order to
might look like this

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220
 
 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.460
 
okay what's the difference between the

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470
okay what's the difference between the
 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.730
okay what's the difference between the
two expressions the highest the highest

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740
two expressions the highest the highest
 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:39.880
two expressions the highest the highest
power of X here is to the highest power

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890
power of X here is to the highest power
 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:50.260
power of X here is to the highest power
of X here is one okay now a polynomial

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270
of X here is one okay now a polynomial
 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.760
of X here is one okay now a polynomial
of order 3 which is what my cost

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770
of order 3 which is what my cost
 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:03.600
of order 3 which is what my cost
function looked like will look like this

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610
function looked like will look like this
 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:28.550
function looked like will look like this
and so that'll be something like

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560
 
 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.870
 
ok

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880
 
 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.740
 
yes

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750
 
 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.440
 
in my definition of convexity in

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450
in my definition of convexity in
 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.610
in my definition of convexity in
concavity I actually didn't use the

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620
concavity I actually didn't use the
 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.790
concavity I actually didn't use the
full-blown mathematical definition to in

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800
full-blown mathematical definition to in
 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.590
full-blown mathematical definition to in
order to simplify things in particular

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600
order to simplify things in particular
 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.820
order to simplify things in particular
you call a function convex or concave

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830
you call a function convex or concave
 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.930
you call a function convex or concave
not over its entire domain but just for

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940
not over its entire domain but just for
 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.840
not over its entire domain but just for
an interval so if it is monotonically

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850
an interval so if it is monotonically
 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.140
an interval so if it is monotonically
increasing in an interval then its

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150
increasing in an interval then its
 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.940
increasing in an interval then its
convex in that interval so along this

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950
convex in that interval so along this
 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:17.250
convex in that interval so along this
part along all of this it's con its

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260
part along all of this it's con its
 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:24.270
part along all of this it's con its
convex and along here it's concave ok so

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280
convex and along here it's concave ok so
 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.390
convex and along here it's concave ok so
so you know for more complicated

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400
so you know for more complicated
 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.670
so you know for more complicated
functions if they'll be concave and

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680
functions if they'll be concave and
 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.070
functions if they'll be concave and
convex it for different intervals ok so

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080
convex it for different intervals ok so
 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:39.490
convex it for different intervals ok so
that's a very good question

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500
 
 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:48.110
 
okay okay so we wanted to interpret this

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120
okay okay so we wanted to interpret this
 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.520
okay okay so we wanted to interpret this
example we had here a polynomial to

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530
example we had here a polynomial to
 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.770
example we had here a polynomial to
order three it'll look something like

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780
order three it'll look something like
 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.450
order three it'll look something like
that and the nature of our

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460
that and the nature of our
 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.719
that and the nature of our
differentiation remember that when I

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:02.729
differentiation remember that when I
 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:05.059
differentiation remember that when I
take this derivative I end up with

00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:05.069
take this derivative I end up with
 

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:08.170
take this derivative I end up with
something that is an expression that

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180
something that is an expression that
 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:13.480
something that is an expression that
gives me a polynomial to order to okay

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490
gives me a polynomial to order to okay
 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.360
gives me a polynomial to order to okay
so that means that if I start out with a

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.370
so that means that if I start out with a
 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.580
so that means that if I start out with a
polynomial like that and I take its

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590
polynomial like that and I take its
 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:26.629
polynomial like that and I take its
derivative then the derivative will look

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639
derivative then the derivative will look
 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:31.010
derivative then the derivative will look
something like that okay simplify and

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020
something like that okay simplify and
 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.510
something like that okay simplify and
and the derivative of this will be a

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520
and the derivative of this will be a
 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.909
and the derivative of this will be a
straight line and so on so that's why I

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:34.919
straight line and so on so that's why I
 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:38.980
straight line and so on so that's why I
was saying earlier that you know many

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:38.990
was saying earlier that you know many
 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.529
was saying earlier that you know many
functions that we could construct just

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:42.539
functions that we could construct just
 

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:45.469
functions that we could construct just
randomly for often we would construct

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:45.479
randomly for often we would construct
 

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:48.559
randomly for often we would construct
them this way as polynomials of higher

00:06:48.559 --> 00:06:48.569
them this way as polynomials of higher
 

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:51.019
them this way as polynomials of higher
degree you would you simply take

00:06:51.019 --> 00:06:51.029
degree you would you simply take
 

00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:52.550
degree you would you simply take
derivatives to get to a straight line

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560
derivatives to get to a straight line
 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.850
derivatives to get to a straight line
you know and that's and many many

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:57.860
you know and that's and many many
 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.100
you know and that's and many many
complex scientific models are built that

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:01.110
complex scientific models are built that
 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:04.640
complex scientific models are built that
way they're simply you know they're

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:04.650
way they're simply you know they're
 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:08.209
way they're simply you know they're
there are you know because usually when

00:07:08.209 --> 00:07:08.219
there are you know because usually when
 

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:10.399
there are you know because usually when
we build these models we are building

00:07:10.399 --> 00:07:10.409
we build these models we are building
 

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:14.329
we build these models we are building
from simple building blocks for example

00:07:14.329 --> 00:07:14.339
from simple building blocks for example
 

00:07:14.339 --> 00:07:16.640
from simple building blocks for example
we think that there might be some linear

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:16.650
we think that there might be some linear
 

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.689
we think that there might be some linear
relationship between you know we

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:20.699
relationship between you know we
 

00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:23.749
relationship between you know we
generally so if you think about one of

00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759
generally so if you think about one of
 

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:27.100
generally so if you think about one of
the things that I'm interested in is

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:27.110
the things that I'm interested in is
 

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:31.219
the things that I'm interested in is
whether derivatives and sorry actually

00:07:31.219 --> 00:07:31.229
whether derivatives and sorry actually
 

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:32.809
whether derivatives and sorry actually
that's not a good example because I was

00:07:32.809 --> 00:07:32.819
that's not a good example because I was
 

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:34.550
that's not a good example because I was
think that weather derivatives there are

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:34.560
think that weather derivatives there are
 

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.379
think that weather derivatives there are
different kinds of directions I was

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:36.389
different kinds of directions I was
 

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:38.800
different kinds of directions I was
thinking of financial derivatives not

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:38.810
thinking of financial derivatives not
 

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:43.730
thinking of financial derivatives not
calculus but so let's say you want to

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:43.740
calculus but so let's say you want to
 

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:47.139
calculus but so let's say you want to
model something like precipitation

00:07:47.139 --> 00:07:47.149
model something like precipitation
 

00:07:47.149 --> 00:07:51.139
model something like precipitation
precipitation is not generally a linear

00:07:51.139 --> 00:07:51.149
precipitation is not generally a linear
 

00:07:51.149 --> 00:07:54.040
precipitation is not generally a linear
function of any

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:54.050
function of any
 

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:58.999
function of any
but so it but it but different pieces of

00:07:58.999 --> 00:07:59.009
but so it but it but different pieces of
 

00:07:59.009 --> 00:08:01.189
but so it but it but different pieces of
it different building blocks might be

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:01.199
it different building blocks might be
 

00:08:01.199 --> 00:08:05.479
it different building blocks might be
linear functions you you know when you

00:08:05.479 --> 00:08:05.489
linear functions you you know when you
 

00:08:05.489 --> 00:08:07.429
linear functions you you know when you
build a climate model you might think

00:08:07.429 --> 00:08:07.439
build a climate model you might think
 

00:08:07.439 --> 00:08:11.719
build a climate model you might think
that whether or not the monsoon will

00:08:11.719 --> 00:08:11.729
that whether or not the monsoon will
 

00:08:11.729 --> 00:08:15.949
that whether or not the monsoon will
come before a certain high pressure

00:08:15.949 --> 00:08:15.959
come before a certain high pressure
 

00:08:15.959 --> 00:08:20.419
come before a certain high pressure
system develops over the Indian Ocean is

00:08:20.419 --> 00:08:20.429
system develops over the Indian Ocean is
 

00:08:20.429 --> 00:08:23.570
system develops over the Indian Ocean is
a linear function and so that peace will

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:23.580
a linear function and so that peace will
 

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.489
a linear function and so that peace will
be linear but that plus some other

00:08:25.489 --> 00:08:25.499
be linear but that plus some other
 

00:08:25.499 --> 00:08:28.399
be linear but that plus some other
linear piece put together interactive

00:08:28.399 --> 00:08:28.409
linear piece put together interactive
 

00:08:28.409 --> 00:08:31.369
linear piece put together interactive
might not be linear and when you build a

00:08:31.369 --> 00:08:31.379
might not be linear and when you build a
 

00:08:31.379 --> 00:08:34.569
might not be linear and when you build a
model it might end up looking

00:08:34.569 --> 00:08:34.579
model it might end up looking
 

00:08:34.579 --> 00:08:37.219
model it might end up looking
approximately like this but then when

00:08:37.219 --> 00:08:37.229
approximately like this but then when
 

00:08:37.229 --> 00:08:38.719
approximately like this but then when
you start to take derivatives on

00:08:38.719 --> 00:08:38.729
you start to take derivatives on
 

00:08:38.729 --> 00:08:40.939
you start to take derivatives on
different dimensions you'll end up with

00:08:40.939 --> 00:08:40.949
different dimensions you'll end up with
 

00:08:40.949 --> 00:08:43.129
different dimensions you'll end up with
linearity because you'll have and even

00:08:43.129 --> 00:08:43.139
linearity because you'll have and even
 

00:08:43.139 --> 00:08:45.949
linearity because you'll have and even
if you don't know exactly how the model

00:08:45.949 --> 00:08:45.959
if you don't know exactly how the model
 

00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:50.269
if you don't know exactly how the model
has started their thought process just

00:08:50.269 --> 00:08:50.279
has started their thought process just
 

00:08:50.279 --> 00:08:52.160
has started their thought process just
by taking derivatives you'll get to an

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:52.170
by taking derivatives you'll get to an
 

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:56.329
by taking derivatives you'll get to an
approximate relationship okay so that's

00:08:56.329 --> 00:08:56.339
approximate relationship okay so that's
 

00:08:56.339 --> 00:08:59.509
approximate relationship okay so that's
yes yes through the mathematical

00:08:59.509 --> 00:08:59.519
yes yes through the mathematical
 

00:08:59.519 --> 00:09:01.910
yes yes through the mathematical
calculation yeah it would be usually

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:01.920
calculation yeah it would be usually
 

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.819
calculation yeah it would be usually
this these will be multivariate

00:09:03.819 --> 00:09:03.829
this these will be multivariate
 

00:09:03.829 --> 00:09:07.400
this these will be multivariate
functions so it wouldn't you wouldn't

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:07.410
functions so it wouldn't you wouldn't
 

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:09.410
functions so it wouldn't you wouldn't
really even have a girl I mean it would

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:09.420
really even have a girl I mean it would
 

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.030
really even have a girl I mean it would
be a multi-dimensional gruff you'd have

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.040
be a multi-dimensional gruff you'd have
 

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.670
be a multi-dimensional gruff you'd have
to take a single section through and

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680
to take a single section through and
 

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:18.100
to take a single section through and
then you'd get a graph and it would be

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:18.110
then you'd get a graph and it would be
 

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:20.210
then you'd get a graph and it would be
you you wouldn't do it that way

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:20.220
you you wouldn't do it that way
 

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:29.749
you you wouldn't do it that way
basically right ok ok so now so we get a

00:09:29.749 --> 00:09:29.759
basically right ok ok so now so we get a
 

00:09:29.759 --> 00:09:33.679
basically right ok ok so now so we get a
somewhat simpler you know a polynomial

00:09:33.679 --> 00:09:33.689
somewhat simpler you know a polynomial
 

00:09:33.689 --> 00:09:45.470
somewhat simpler you know a polynomial
of lower order and you and then this

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:45.480
of lower order and you and then this
 

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.139
of lower order and you and then this
this funk this functional relationship

00:09:48.139 --> 00:09:48.149
this funk this functional relationship
 

00:09:48.149 --> 00:09:51.769
this funk this functional relationship
simply tells you the slope of the

00:09:51.769 --> 00:09:51.779
simply tells you the slope of the
 

00:09:51.779 --> 00:09:53.990
simply tells you the slope of the
original function for whatever values of

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000
original function for whatever values of
 

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.150
original function for whatever values of
X so this was devidas question earlier

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:56.160
X so this was devidas question earlier
 

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.960
X so this was devidas question earlier
about you know I didn't get why the

00:09:59.960 --> 00:09:59.970
about you know I didn't get why the
 

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:02.629
about you know I didn't get why the
derivative what happens if i plug the

00:10:02.629 --> 00:10:02.639
derivative what happens if i plug the
 

00:10:02.639 --> 00:10:05.809
derivative what happens if i plug the
value of 5 back into the derivative well

00:10:05.809 --> 00:10:05.819
value of 5 back into the derivative well
 

00:10:05.819 --> 00:10:06.980
value of 5 back into the derivative well
it simply gives me

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:06.990
it simply gives me
 

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.230
it simply gives me
the slope of the original equation so if

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:09.240
the slope of the original equation so if
 

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.889
the slope of the original equation so if
i plug the value of 3 into this equation

00:10:12.889 --> 00:10:12.899
i plug the value of 3 into this equation
 

00:10:12.899 --> 00:10:15.519
i plug the value of 3 into this equation
it'll give me the slope of that equation

00:10:15.519 --> 00:10:15.529
it'll give me the slope of that equation
 

00:10:15.529 --> 00:10:24.500
it'll give me the slope of that equation
ok ok ok and you could actually just do

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:24.510
ok ok ok and you could actually just do
 

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:31.400
ok ok ok and you could actually just do
that numerically so the rule that you

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:31.410
that numerically so the rule that you
 

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:39.829
that numerically so the rule that you
saw that that you're used to is the the

00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:39.839
saw that that you're used to is the the
 

00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:42.199
saw that that you're used to is the the
power rule but not the general power

00:10:42.199 --> 00:10:42.209
power rule but not the general power
 

00:10:42.209 --> 00:10:54.019
power rule but not the general power
rule ok so if you take something like 5x

00:10:54.019 --> 00:10:54.029
rule ok so if you take something like 5x
 

00:10:54.029 --> 00:10:58.660
rule ok so if you take something like 5x
cubed it's derivative is 15x squared

00:10:58.660 --> 00:10:58.670
cubed it's derivative is 15x squared
 

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:03.070
cubed it's derivative is 15x squared
you're taking three multiplying it by 5

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:03.080
you're taking three multiplying it by 5
 

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:07.460
you're taking three multiplying it by 5
times X to the power less than 3 1 less

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:07.470
times X to the power less than 3 1 less
 

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:11.930
times X to the power less than 3 1 less
than three ok that's when X is

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:11.940
than three ok that's when X is
 

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:16.550
than three ok that's when X is
multiplied by a constant multiple 5 but

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:16.560
multiplied by a constant multiple 5 but
 

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.940
multiplied by a constant multiple 5 but
suppose that X is multiplied not by a

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:19.950
suppose that X is multiplied not by a
 

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:25.790
suppose that X is multiplied not by a
constant but by another function ok

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:25.800
constant but by another function ok
 

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:33.769
constant but by another function ok
suppose that instead of 5x cubed I had I

00:11:33.769 --> 00:11:33.779
suppose that instead of 5x cubed I had I
 

00:11:33.779 --> 00:11:43.250
suppose that instead of 5x cubed I had I
had let's say X to take the square root

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:43.260
had let's say X to take the square root
 

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:51.110
had let's say X to take the square root
of x times X cubed ok there are multiple

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:51.120
of x times X cubed ok there are multiple
 

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.380
of x times X cubed ok there are multiple
ways you could do this but one useful

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:54.390
ways you could do this but one useful
 

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:56.780
ways you could do this but one useful
rule to keep in mind is the general

00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:56.790
rule to keep in mind is the general
 

00:11:56.790 --> 00:12:04.240
rule to keep in mind is the general
power rule which is if you have a

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:04.250
power rule which is if you have a
 

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:12.410
power rule which is if you have a
function that says if you have a

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:12.420
function that says if you have a
 

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:14.840
function that says if you have a
function on the inside and you raise

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:14.850
function on the inside and you raise
 

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:17.810
function on the inside and you raise
that whole function to the power n then

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:17.820
that whole function to the power n then
 

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.180
that whole function to the power n then
the derivative you

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:20.190
the derivative you
 

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:22.490
the derivative you
put the end in front of the overall

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:22.500
put the end in front of the overall
 

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.160
put the end in front of the overall
function you keep that overall

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:25.170
function you keep that overall
 

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:28.610
function you keep that overall
functional form you take n minus 1 then

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:28.620
functional form you take n minus 1 then
 

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.320
functional form you take n minus 1 then
you take the derivative of the inside

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:30.330
you take the derivative of the inside
 

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:34.610
you take the derivative of the inside
function you multiply it by itself okay

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:34.620
function you multiply it by itself okay
 

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:37.040
function you multiply it by itself okay
and you could apply that rule if I just

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:37.050
and you could apply that rule if I just
 

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:40.280
and you could apply that rule if I just
had five here you could still apply that

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:40.290
had five here you could still apply that
 

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:42.590
had five here you could still apply that
rule you could think of five as a

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:42.600
rule you could think of five as a
 

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:46.580
rule you could think of five as a
function what's the derivative of the

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:46.590
function what's the derivative of the
 

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:54.140
function what's the derivative of the
function 50 okay and so you could just

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:54.150
function 50 okay and so you could just
 

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:59.060
function 50 okay and so you could just
think of that dropping away but so let's

00:12:59.060 --> 00:12:59.070
think of that dropping away but so let's
 

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:04.070
think of that dropping away but so let's
suppose that we we do an example where

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:04.080
suppose that we we do an example where
 

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:09.580
suppose that we we do an example where
we've got G of X let's say g of x is

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:09.590
we've got G of X let's say g of x is
 

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:15.280
we've got G of X let's say g of x is
equal to the square root of x okay and

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:15.290
equal to the square root of x okay and
 

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:25.010
equal to the square root of x okay and
we've got the larger function being

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:25.020
we've got the larger function being
 

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:31.120
we've got the larger function being
raised to the power 3 so i have to find

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:31.130
raised to the power 3 so i have to find
 

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:44.470
raised to the power 3 so i have to find
the derivative of the function

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:44.480
 
 

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.019
 
okay so that one way you could do it if

00:13:47.019 --> 00:13:47.029
okay so that one way you could do it if
 

00:13:47.029 --> 00:13:50.699
okay so that one way you could do it if
you remember your laws of exponents is

00:13:50.699 --> 00:13:50.709
you remember your laws of exponents is
 

00:13:50.709 --> 00:13:54.819
you remember your laws of exponents is
how do you express this X to the half

00:13:54.819 --> 00:13:54.829
how do you express this X to the half
 

00:13:54.829 --> 00:13:58.660
how do you express this X to the half
right so this would be X to the half so

00:13:58.660 --> 00:13:58.670
right so this would be X to the half so
 

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:01.660
right so this would be X to the half so
if you take the brackets out to be half

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:01.670
if you take the brackets out to be half
 

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:03.759
if you take the brackets out to be half
times three so there'll be three halves

00:14:03.759 --> 00:14:03.769
times three so there'll be three halves
 

00:14:03.769 --> 00:14:05.819
times three so there'll be three halves
which is really x to the three halves

00:14:05.819 --> 00:14:05.829
which is really x to the three halves
 

00:14:05.829 --> 00:14:08.259
which is really x to the three halves
then you take the treehouse put it in

00:14:08.259 --> 00:14:08.269
then you take the treehouse put it in
 

00:14:08.269 --> 00:14:11.019
then you take the treehouse put it in
front minus three-halves minus 1 and so

00:14:11.019 --> 00:14:11.029
front minus three-halves minus 1 and so
 

00:14:11.029 --> 00:14:16.389
front minus three-halves minus 1 and so
on you could do it that way or you could

00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:16.399
on you could do it that way or you could
 

00:14:16.399 --> 00:14:23.410
on you could do it that way or you could
use this approach which says that you're

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:23.420
use this approach which says that you're
 

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:28.259
use this approach which says that you're
going to take the n that's the three

00:14:28.259 --> 00:14:28.269
 
 

00:14:28.269 --> 00:14:39.629
 
times the inside function then 3-1 okay

00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:39.639
times the inside function then 3-1 okay
 

00:14:39.639 --> 00:14:41.949
times the inside function then 3-1 okay
times the derivative of the inside

00:14:41.949 --> 00:14:41.959
times the derivative of the inside
 

00:14:41.959 --> 00:14:46.810
times the derivative of the inside
function and here what's the derivative

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:46.820
function and here what's the derivative
 

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:50.519
function and here what's the derivative
of the inside function well that's minus

00:14:50.519 --> 00:14:50.529
of the inside function well that's minus
 

00:14:50.529 --> 00:15:06.190
of the inside function well that's minus
half x to the minus three-halves right

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:06.200
 
 

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:10.040
 
because the inside function is really x

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:10.050
because the inside function is really x
 

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:14.740
because the inside function is really x
to the half so that becomes oh sorry

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:14.750
to the half so that becomes oh sorry
 

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:19.700
to the half so that becomes oh sorry
that becomes half x to the minus half

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:19.710
that becomes half x to the minus half
 

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:32.810
that becomes half x to the minus half
saree good catch that's right okay so

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:32.820
saree good catch that's right okay so
 

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:41.600
saree good catch that's right okay so
this is one step that's how I get this x

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:41.610
this is one step that's how I get this x
 

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:48.710
this is one step that's how I get this x
this thing that's just a two and this is

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:48.720
this thing that's just a two and this is
 

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:51.140
this thing that's just a two and this is
going to boil down this is just X to the

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:51.150
going to boil down this is just X to the
 

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:56.720
going to boil down this is just X to the
half so again you could do half times

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:56.730
half so again you could do half times
 

00:15:56.730 --> 00:16:02.390
half so again you could do half times
two that would just be one and you

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:02.400
two that would just be one and you
 

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.810
two that would just be one and you
couldn't boil this down because it's

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:05.820
couldn't boil this down because it's
 

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:09.170
couldn't boil this down because it's
still going to be minus a half so you'll

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:09.180
still going to be minus a half so you'll
 

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:11.860
still going to be minus a half so you'll
have an X here and X to the minus half

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:11.870
have an X here and X to the minus half
 

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:15.380
have an X here and X to the minus half
so be something like x over the square

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:15.390
so be something like x over the square
 

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:21.760
so be something like x over the square
root of x times the coefficient okay

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:21.770
root of x times the coefficient okay
 

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:26.090
root of x times the coefficient okay
this this stuff clearly some of you are

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:26.100
this this stuff clearly some of you are
 

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:29.000
this this stuff clearly some of you are
familiar with it others it's going to be

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:29.010
familiar with it others it's going to be
 

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:32.150
familiar with it others it's going to be
new for you you're not really going to

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160
new for you you're not really going to
 

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:36.740
new for you you're not really going to
use it in the economics classes you may

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:36.750
use it in the economics classes you may
 

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:39.260
use it in the economics classes you may
use it a little bit in some of the

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:39.270
use it a little bit in some of the
 

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:42.800
use it a little bit in some of the
science classes but you're not going to

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:42.810
science classes but you're not going to
 

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:47.000
science classes but you're not going to
use it in the way that involves you

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:47.010
use it in the way that involves you
 

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:49.640
use it in the way that involves you
having to memorize any of it in other

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:49.650
having to memorize any of it in other
 

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:52.550
having to memorize any of it in other
words you have to know that these rules

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:52.560
words you have to know that these rules
 

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:57.260
words you have to know that these rules
exist and you have to know that if

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:57.270
exist and you have to know that if
 

00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:59.570
exist and you have to know that if
you're faced with a problem where you

00:16:59.570 --> 00:16:59.580
you're faced with a problem where you
 

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.790
you're faced with a problem where you
have to take a derivative and it has a

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:01.800
have to take a derivative and it has a
 

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.310
have to take a derivative and it has a
certain amount of complexity then you'll

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:04.320
certain amount of complexity then you'll
 

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:08.450
certain amount of complexity then you'll
want to use these rules so I'm going to

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:08.460
want to use these rules so I'm going to
 

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:10.820
want to use these rules so I'm going to
just go ahead quickly through some of

00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:10.830
just go ahead quickly through some of
 

00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:12.680
just go ahead quickly through some of
them so that we can get to the

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:12.690
them so that we can get to the
 

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:15.280
them so that we can get to the
multivariate pod which is actually

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:15.290
multivariate pod which is actually
 

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:17.330
multivariate pod which is actually
conceptually a little bit more

00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:17.340
conceptually a little bit more
 

00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:18.860
conceptually a little bit more
complicated but

00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:18.870
complicated but
 

00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:24.030
complicated but
requires that you know this okay and if

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:24.040
requires that you know this okay and if
 

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.850
requires that you know this okay and if
you like you can do the examples that

00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:26.860
you like you can do the examples that
 

00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:30.510
you like you can do the examples that
I've given you on how to employ this so

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:30.520
I've given you on how to employ this so
 

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:34.350
I've given you on how to employ this so
here here is actually a slightly easier

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:34.360
here here is actually a slightly easier
 

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.440
here here is actually a slightly easier
version where the inside function is 2x

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:37.450
version where the inside function is 2x
 

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:43.020

plus 3 as opposed to X cubed okay and

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:43.030
plus 3 as opposed to X cubed okay and
 

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:46.020
plus 3 as opposed to X cubed okay and
you use the power rule you work out the

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:46.030
you use the power rule you work out the
 

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:48.480
you use the power rule you work out the
outside derivative and you work out the

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:48.490
outside derivative and you work out the
 

00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:51.860
outside derivative and you work out the
inside derivative and you multiply that

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:51.870
inside derivative and you multiply that
 

00:17:51.870 --> 00:18:00.260
inside derivative and you multiply that
times that to get you the final answer

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:00.270
 
 

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:04.980
 
okay you've seen the constant multiple

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:04.990
okay you've seen the constant multiple
 

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:13.230
okay you've seen the constant multiple

product rule is something you should you
 

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:18.390
product rule is something you should you
should see or know about because you'll

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:18.400
should see or know about because you'll
 

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:23.310
should see or know about because you'll
see this a lot often you have a function

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:23.320
see this a lot often you have a function
 

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:30.110

that's the product of two functions well

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:30.120
that's the product of two functions well
 

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:34.080
that's the product of two functions well
you could multiply out the two functions

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:34.090
you could multiply out the two functions
 

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:37.550
you could multiply out the two functions
and then take derivatives term by term

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:37.560
and then take derivatives term by term
 

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:42.420
and then take derivatives term by term
but sometimes as you know when you

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:42.430
but sometimes as you know when you
 

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:47.340
but sometimes as you know when you
multiply out a function or when you

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:47.350
multiply out a function or when you
 

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:49.470
multiply out a function or when you
multiply out a product with many terms

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:49.480
multiply out a product with many terms
 

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:52.200
multiply out a product with many terms
it'll look significantly more

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:52.210
it'll look significantly more
 

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:54.090
it'll look significantly more
complicated than when it is kept in

factored form in fact very often you

00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:57.220
factored form in fact very often you
 

00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.610
factored form in fact very often you
spend your time simplifying inter

00:18:59.610 --> 00:18:59.620
spend your time simplifying inter
 

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:02.100
spend your time simplifying inter
factored form right so you don't want to

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:02.110
factored form right so you don't want to
 

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:05.940
factored form right so you don't want to
have to multiply that out before you

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:05.950
have to multiply that out before you
 

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:08.910
have to multiply that out before you
take a derivative that's why the product

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:08.920
take a derivative that's why the product
 

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:12.780
take a derivative that's why the product
rule is useful the derivative of that

in college or high school you

00:19:32.669 --> 00:19:32.679
in college or high school you
 

00:19:32.679 --> 00:19:34.499
in college or high school you
this is probably one of the rules that

00:19:34.499 --> 00:19:34.509
this is probably one of the rules that
 

00:19:34.509 --> 00:19:43.049
this is probably one of the rules that
you still remember okay and so this

00:19:43.049 --> 00:19:43.059
you still remember okay and so this
 

00:19:43.059 --> 00:19:46.109
you still remember okay and so this
allows you to compute the derivative of

G compute the derivative of H substitute
 

00:19:51.639 --> 00:19:55.019
G compute the derivative of H substitute
g and h and then you have a much more

00:19:55.019 --> 00:19:55.029
g and h and then you have a much more
 

00:19:55.029 --> 00:19:57.720
g and h and then you have a much more
simplified expression and you computer

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:57.730
simplified expression and you computer
 

00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:10.830
simplified expression and you computer
whatever prime is ok yeah let's yeah

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:10.840
whatever prime is ok yeah let's yeah
 

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:14.789
whatever prime is ok yeah let's yeah
let's let's do that example again I if

00:20:14.789 --> 00:20:14.799
let's let's do that example again I if
 

00:20:14.799 --> 00:20:17.159
let's let's do that example again I if
I'm if I'm just glossing over things

00:20:17.159 --> 00:20:17.169
I'm if I'm just glossing over things
 

00:20:17.169 --> 00:20:19.200
I'm if I'm just glossing over things
stop me and say let's just do that

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:19.210
stop me and say let's just do that
 

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:30.600
stop me and say let's just do that
example right okay so you know you've

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:30.610
example right okay so you know you've
 

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:38.999
example right okay so you know you've
got f prime x is really equal to in this

00:20:38.999 --> 00:20:39.009
got f prime x is really equal to in this
 

00:20:39.009 --> 00:20:43.799
got f prime x is really equal to in this
case the product of two functions this

00:20:43.799 --> 00:20:43.809
case the product of two functions this
 

00:20:43.809 --> 00:20:58.320
case the product of two functions this
is G of X and this is H of X okay so i

00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:58.330
is G of X and this is H of X okay so i
 

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:04.980
is G of X and this is H of X okay so i
simply substitute my rule i know that

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:04.990
simply substitute my rule i know that
 

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:11.999
simply substitute my rule i know that
that is G times H prime plus h times G

00:21:11.999 --> 00:21:12.009
that is G times H prime plus h times G
 

00:21:12.009 --> 00:21:19.669
that is G times H prime plus h times G
prime ok well gee is just that X minus 3

00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679
prime ok well gee is just that X minus 3
 

00:21:19.679 --> 00:21:32.820
prime ok well gee is just that X minus 3
h prime what's H prime for X and H is 2x

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:32.830
h prime what's H prime for X and H is 2x
 

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:37.470
h prime what's H prime for X and H is 2x
squared minus 1 and what's G prime one

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:37.480
squared minus 1 and what's G prime one
 

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:45.440
squared minus 1 and what's G prime one
right and I could simplify this out if

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:45.450
right and I could simplify this out if
 

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:49.759
right and I could simplify this out if
and so so that's going to be 4x squared

00:21:49.759 --> 00:21:49.769
and so so that's going to be 4x squared
 

00:21:49.769 --> 00:21:59.180
and so so that's going to be 4x squared
minus 12x plus 2x squared minus 1 okay

00:21:59.180 --> 00:21:59.190
minus 12x plus 2x squared minus 1 okay
 

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:01.519
minus 12x plus 2x squared minus 1 okay
this and that will give you 6 x squared

00:22:01.519 --> 00:22:01.529
this and that will give you 6 x squared
 

00:22:01.529 --> 00:22:06.409
this and that will give you 6 x squared
minus 12x and that's what hopefully I

00:22:06.409 --> 00:22:06.419
minus 12x and that's what hopefully I
 

00:22:06.419 --> 00:22:18.889
minus 12x and that's what hopefully I
have up there okay okay okay so what I

00:22:18.889 --> 00:22:18.899
have up there okay okay okay so what I
 

00:22:18.899 --> 00:22:22.549
have up there okay okay okay so what I
did is I compiled a whole bunch of

00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559
did is I compiled a whole bunch of
 

00:22:22.559 --> 00:22:26.149
did is I compiled a whole bunch of
useful rules and I put them on a couple

00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:26.159
useful rules and I put them on a couple
 

00:22:26.159 --> 00:22:31.310
useful rules and I put them on a couple

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:31.320
of slides for you we don't need to go
 

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.310
of slides for you we don't need to go
through these but they are sometimes

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.320
through these but they are sometimes
 

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:42.940
through these but they are sometimes
useful when doing problem sets

of this function e to the X is always

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:24.260
of this function e to the X is always
 

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:34.720
of this function e to the X is always
equal to its value sorry well it's you

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:34.730
equal to its value sorry well it's you
 

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:38.560
equal to its value sorry well it's you
know it's a it's a very useful expert

you know it has biological applications

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:00.890
you know it has biological applications
 

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:05.860
you know it has biological applications
in particular suppose that the you know

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:05.870
in particular suppose that the you know
 

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:11.730
in particular suppose that the you know
suppose that you that the the growth of

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:11.740
suppose that you that the the growth of
 

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:15.669
suppose that you that the the growth of
some proportion of a species in the

00:24:15.669 --> 00:24:15.679
some proportion of a species in the
 

00:24:15.679 --> 00:24:19.539
some proportion of a species in the
population is dependent on the size of

00:24:19.539 --> 00:24:19.549
population is dependent on the size of
 

00:24:19.549 --> 00:24:23.830
population is dependent on the size of
that proportion in the population so you

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:23.840
that proportion in the population so you
 

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:28.120
that proportion in the population so you
would imagine a scenario where if you

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:28.130
would imagine a scenario where if you
 

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:32.440
would imagine a scenario where if you
have a species the larger the bigger a

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:32.450
have a species the larger the bigger a
 

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:35.200
have a species the larger the bigger a
portion of the globe it takes up the

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:35.210
portion of the globe it takes up the
 

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:38.140
portion of the globe it takes up the
faster it goes
