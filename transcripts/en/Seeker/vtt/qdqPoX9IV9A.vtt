00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.000
Climate deal, shlimate deal, amirite?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:13.240
We don't actually have to do anything, do
we?

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.500
At the recent COP21**** climate conference
in Paris, 195 countries promised planet Earth

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.520
we'd stop messing with her.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.340
The press is calling it a huge win for environmentalists,
world cooperation, and for the health of our

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.340
planet.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.780
President Obama said in a speech after the
deal was signed, this could be "the best chance

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.590
we have to save the one planet we have."

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.410
But we just signed a piece of paper, we haven't
done anything yet.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.350
The UN has held a Climate Change "Conference
of the Parties," every year since the mid-90s,

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.940
but more often the narrative is about their
shortcomings rather than successes.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.440
The U.S. famously avoided the 1997 Kyoto Protocol,
and at the 2009 Copenhagen conference the

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.739
rich European countries (who got rich by burning
coal) told developing nations like China and

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.200
India to agree to the same cuts they were
imposing on themselves -- nah bro.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.580
There are a lot of examples of climate policy
fails, but listing them all gets depressing.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.990
While we fight over language, climate change
continues to ravage the planet.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.780
Knowing this, decisionmakers came to Paris
with a different strategy!

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.700
Unlike conferences in the past, Paris' COP21
let each country set its own goals for limiting

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.410
or slowing carbon emissions, fighting deforestation,
maintaining transparency on climate issues

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.409
and identifying the adverse effects of climate
change.

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.659
In the last year, every country submitted
a set of goals, called Intended Nationally

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.240
Determined Contributions (INDCs).

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.229
Though each are different, they're all based
on keeping Earth under the dangerous 2C temperature

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.950
increase agreed on at Cancun's COP in 2010.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.980
Now everyone has the same finish-line, and
their own map to get there, AND they've all

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.380
signed the COP21 deal!

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.860
We're on our way y'all!!

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.860
Right?...?

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.540
So next, is each country shifts their wooden-cogged
bureaucracies into gear toward a net-zero

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.740
emissions goal.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.119
From now until 2018, they'll assess how to
achieve the first steps laid out in the Paris

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.479
accords; then they'll meetup and showcase
their kickstarted plans.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.900
According to their INDCs: China is investing
heavily in clean energy and will attempt to

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.580
decrease after 2030; the U.S. will reduce
carbon emissions by 26 percent from levels

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.040
measured in 2005; the European Union will
cut 40 percent, Brazil will cut 37 percent

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.370
and curb deforestation to keep the Amazon
carbon sink in tact -- trees suck up carbon!

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.310
Yay! India (the third largest CO2 emitter)
is planning to promote clean energy generation

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.340
and consumption.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.150
And even many Pacific Islands (some of which
will be underwater before the 2100 target

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.540
date) are submitting INDCs!

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.320
The Paris agreement is exceedingly complex,
but COP21 guarantees each nation has their

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.770
own, reachable, goals!

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.820
The politicians involved are calling this
a huge diplomatic success; but is that the

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.350
scientific reality?

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.950
[[skeptical noise]].

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.550
Vox put together a chart from Climate Action
Tracker data, and found without COP21's plan

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:09.700
we'd hit a 3.8C increase by 2100.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.210
With the Paris pledges we'll still hit 2.7C!

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.660
WAY over the 2C upper limit!

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.180
The agreement calls for deep reductions.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.849
And we need DEEP cuts, but they will hurt.

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:27.930
So, to help developed nations overachieve
their goals, rich countries pledged 100 billion

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.099
dollars per year in public and private investment
by 2020 to will help the poorer countries

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:37.830
get affordable clean energy and lessen their
struggles to meet ambitious climate goals.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:44.200
Look, in the end, COP21 is revolutionary on
one hand because nearly 200 countries recognized

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.450
publicly that lowering carbon emissions to
curb climate change is important!

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.360
So what happens now?

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.890
The diplomats have to convince the governing
bodies of their home nations to follow the

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:55.890
pledge.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.500
What we have to do now is as citizens, keep
the pressure on our leaders.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.530
While the actual GOALS aren't legally punishable,
they will HAVE to show up in public transparently,

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.319
and say WHY they didn't meet them every five
years.

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.409
In the end, most are seeing this as the first
step of a long, hard road.

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:19.549
But a road that will have our children and
descendants breathing easier.

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.470
Of course, some countries won't be breathing
at all, because climate change will have already

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.229
drowned some of them, overrunning their land
with ocean.

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:29.259
