00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.710
- [Instructor] My history professor,

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.040
who always criticizes me for being late,

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.350
missed our scheduled review session.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.740
So you could tell just in how I read it,

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.980
I had to put a pause here in
order for it to make sense.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.860
In order for who always
criticizes me for being late

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.120
to describe my history professor.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.460
So ideally, I wanna put a comma

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.730
at the beginning and
the end of this clause,

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.680
that is describing my history professor.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.160
I don't wanna keep it the same.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.010
I wanna put a comma at the
beginning and at the end.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.530
So I like that choice.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:28.790
Now, let's look at these other ones.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.080
My history professor, dash,

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.870
who always criticizes me for being late.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.590
You could separate this clause with a dash

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.660
but you'd wanna separate
with a dash on either side.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:39.970
So if you put a dash here,

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.080
you'd wanna put a dash right over there,

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.010
which is kind of a,

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.700
you could view it as a
stronger parenthetical.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.630
My history professor,

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.500
who always criticizes me for being late,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.560
missed our scheduled review session.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.810
I always view the dashes like,

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.080
make sure you're seeing this thing.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.860
It's you know, hey, I'm
really gonna make it clear,

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.430
this is the person who always
criticizes me for being late.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.530
So it would have been an option

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.700
if they had a dash on
either end, but they don't.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.810
So we're gonna rule this one out.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:02.730
And for the same reason,

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.190
they only put a dash at the right side

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.090
but not at the left side,

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.323
so I would rule this one out as well.
