[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.465 --> 00:00:07.215
JAIME GREEN: Please
welcome Lizz Winstead.

00:00:07.215 --> 00:00:08.989
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.989 --> 00:00:10.030
LIZZ WINSTEAD: Thank you.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.030
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.730
JAIME GREEN: Lizz Winstead is
the co-creator and former head

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.190
writer of "The Daily
Show" and co-founder

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.570
of Air America Radio.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.300
She's the author of
"Lizz Free Or Die"

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.530
and her latest project is
Lady Parts Justice League.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.075
Lizz, thank you for joining us.

00:00:26.075 --> 00:00:27.700
LIZZ WINSTEAD: Thank
you for having me.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.790
JAIME GREEN: So I
made a note to myself

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.670
and I was coming up
with what to talk about.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.382
I was like, before we dive
into everything I'll just ask,

00:00:33.382 --> 00:00:34.590
like a nice opening question.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.467
Maybe something based
on the news of the day.

00:00:37.467 --> 00:00:39.300
And then I was like,
that's a terrible idea.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.394
That doesn't sound like
a pleasant way to--

00:00:41.394 --> 00:00:43.060
LIZZ WINSTEAD: Well
the news of the day,

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.860
it's like the news
of the moment.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.830
So I don't know when
this goes out but--

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:47.840
JAIME GREEN: Yeah I
haven't looked at twitter

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.190
in the last five minutes.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.065
LIZZ WINSTEAD: There
will be 900 other things

00:00:50.065 --> 00:00:51.710
that will be toppling that.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:52.460
JAIME GREEN: Yeah.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.970
LIZZ WINSTEAD: And
basically, just

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.470
say, garbage fire, and move on.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.230
Just garbage fire.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.438
JAIME GREEN: Yeah, all right.

00:00:57.438 --> 00:00:59.100
So with that out of the way--

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.050
Garbage fire.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.258
LIZZ WINSTEAD: Garbage right.

00:01:02.258 --> 00:01:05.280
JAIME GREEN: Now, what is
Lady Parts Justice League?

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.900
LIZZ WINSTEAD: Well.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.040
It is, we're a nonprofit
that is made up

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.410
of comedians, writers, graphic
designers, shooters, editors.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.090
And it's a bunch of
people that decided

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.070
there is so much
horrible news happening

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.370
in the landscape of
reproductive rights and justice.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.139
And when you turn
on your television

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:30.180
or you talk to other
friends who care about this,

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.839
oftentimes they think they
know and they don't know.

00:01:33.839 --> 00:01:36.130
They know about one third of
what's actually happening.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.410
And so we wanted
to do two things.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.550
We wanted to make
videos that expose

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.410
the politicians and
the laws and just

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.740
the cretins in general who
are assaulting the access

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.450
to reproductive health care.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.284
And then, the other
cool thing we do,

00:01:50.284 --> 00:01:52.200
which is sort of my
favorite thing that we do,

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.530
is we are a band that
is a combination of,

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.370
kind of like, let's
call it a USO Show

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.080
and Habitat for Humanity.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.160
So--

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.050
Actually today we are launching.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.890
We're doing a 16-week tour that
we're just announcing today.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.880
We're going for eight weeks.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.280
We're going to 16 cities.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.880
Starting June 2 in the
Deep South and the Midwest.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.312
We'll do a comedy music show.

00:02:16.312 --> 00:02:18.270
And then we're going to
do outreach to clinics.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.930
We're going to like, help build
fences, do gardening for them.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.240
Bring them like, food,
take them out for drinks,

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.310
anything to sort of
normalize their work.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.800
And to sort of do
an emotional reset

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.710
on what it means to be a
provider because I think--

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.720
I started this in 2012 where I
just did my own little comedy

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.150
tour of clinics.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.040
And when I talked to providers
and maybe the receptionist

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.157
or even like a nurse,
they would say to me,

00:02:47.157 --> 00:02:48.240
thank you for coming here.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.980
No one ever comes.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.800
And that just struck a
chord with me so profoundly

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.100
that I thought, I don't really
have to adjust my life at all.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.700
I'm basically just still
doing shows, making videos,

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.060
but I'm honing in on a subject
that I care deeply about.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.320
That I feel like doesn't
get enough attention.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.990
So that's what it is.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.902
That's what we do.

00:03:07.902 --> 00:03:09.360
JAIME GREEN: That's
pretty awesome.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.290
LIZZ WINSTEAD: Thanks!

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.450
JAIME GREEN: One of the things
you mentioned is gardening.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.440
And I actually hadn't
heard about this before.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.814
Can you talk a
little bit about--

00:03:15.814 --> 00:03:18.970
like, we know what a fence at an
abortion clinic would help do.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.220
Can you talk about the garden?

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.670
LIZZ WINSTEAD:
But you don't know

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.020
what a garden at an
abortion clinic does?

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.050
Well, let me tell you,
because it does many things.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.950
JAIME GREEN: And
it's more than just--

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.199
LIZZ WINSTEAD: And they don't
bury the fetus is there,

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:31.691
contrary to the news from
Breitbart and alternative

00:03:31.691 --> 00:03:32.190
facts.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.392
So a lot of times when we--

00:03:36.392 --> 00:03:38.100
because we contact
the clinics in advance

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.016
to see what they need.

00:03:39.016 --> 00:03:41.830
And they always say things
like, it's like an orphanage

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:42.330
sometimes.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.330
It's like, just, you
know, if you have cupcakes

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.590
or if you could just come by.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.210
It's like, no, seriously.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:49.927
So we bring cupcakes for lunch.

00:03:49.927 --> 00:03:51.760
And then we sort of
assess what's happening.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.420
And so a good example
of what we do is,

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.780
we went to North
Carolina because there's

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.750
an organization that was
called 40 Days For Life that

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.330
was trying to plan a sneak
attack on this clinic.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.310
Well we do some infiltrating
of website and places

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.470
and found out about this.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.220
So we decided to go
down there and preempt

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.140
this massive bust that came.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.050
And so, protesters
oftentimes will stand

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:18.269
on property anywhere they can.

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:19.950
And the clinic doesn't
even see, like,

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.459
a hole that could be filled.

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.820
So we looked at where the
protesters were standing

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.750
and realized, you know, if we
just planted a gigantic holly

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.660
bush-- and if you know anything
about holly it's really

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:31.590
prickly--

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:32.790
that's tall enough.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.090
That is just one space that
a protester can't stand

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.350
and scream into the clinic.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.799
So we do that.

00:04:38.799 --> 00:04:40.590
Sometimes it's like
when you build a fence,

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.465
you just have to do some
gardening around it.

00:04:42.465 --> 00:04:45.360
So it can be strategic
planting or it can be--

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.970
you know what?

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.550
This is the place
people go to the doctor.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:48.383
It should look nice.

00:04:48.383 --> 00:04:49.680
And it should feel normal.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.070
And so our big thing is
to bust stigma, you know,

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.269
get rid of the shame.

00:04:54.269 --> 00:04:56.310
Let doctors feel like they
can live in the light.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:01.440
And have the staff and
people and patients that go,

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.060
feel like they're
doing what they

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.950
are doing, which
is accessing one

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.980
of the panoply of
medical services

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.810
that somebody might
need in their lifetime.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.480
So making it normal.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.174
Making abortion great again.

00:05:14.174 --> 00:05:14.674
Yes!

00:05:14.674 --> 00:05:15.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.270
That's what we do.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.760
JAIME GREEN: Let's, I'd love
to back up and just look

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.630
at how you got here.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.547
So we back all the way up.

00:05:24.547 --> 00:05:26.130
It's my understanding
that you grew up

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.520
in a Catholic home in the
Midwest, is that right?

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.505
LIZZ WINSTEAD: Yes, so
everyone is super psyched

00:05:29.505 --> 00:05:30.660
about my choices in life.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:31.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.410
JAIME GREEN: Yeah, so, did you--

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.780
was there some like,
grand feminist awakening?

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.160
LIZZ WINSTEAD: There was
a couple grand feminists

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.700
awakening.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.719
One was that, much
to the luck of me,

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:45.510
I'm the youngest of
five kids in my family,

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:46.760
my parents are super Catholic.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.172
Like, not like this
Pope Catholic, like--

00:05:49.172 --> 00:05:50.880
JAIME GREEN: A couple
Popes ago Catholic?

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:51.765
LIZZ WINSTEAD: A couple
Popes ago Catholic.

00:05:51.765 --> 00:05:52.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.260
Because this Pope is
sort of awesome, right?

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.660
I mean, he's kind of like,
I always look at this Pope

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:04.209
and I think, he's kind of like
a guy who was in a crappy band

00:06:04.209 --> 00:06:06.000
but now he's having an
amazing solo career.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.420
Right?

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.660
So it's like-- and then
when they play the old hits,

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.285
you're like, shut up
with the old hits.

00:06:11.285 --> 00:06:13.680
Ain't nobody got time
for your old hits.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.487
So it was, it was one
of those things where--

00:06:16.487 --> 00:06:17.570
There was a couple things.

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.784
One, I'd never been--

00:06:19.784 --> 00:06:21.450
and this is going to
just sound horrible

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.574
in the context of what
we've talked about already--

00:06:23.574 --> 00:06:24.930
I was never driven to have kids.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.520
It's just never been
my thing, right?

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.010
And so even as a
little kid, like,

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.740
I'm the person
that loved Barbie.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.350
And so-- because
Barbie had a boyfriend.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:36.026
And she had her own
house and a car.

00:06:36.026 --> 00:06:37.650
And like, I didn't
care about the boobs

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.210
or even that she couldn't stand.

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.700
The fact of the matter is,
she was like, independent.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.950
Put her in the car,
there she goes, you know?

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.630
So I really liked
that in a doll.

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.030
And I-- and even my
mom said, you know,

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.400
you never play with
the things I give you.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.950
And it was like, well, you
gave me like a baby doll.

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:54.390
And then you gave me an iron.

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:55.973
And then you gave
me an ironing board.

00:06:55.973 --> 00:06:57.380
And then you gave me a stove.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:58.838
And it's like,
basically everything

00:06:58.838 --> 00:07:01.530
that you sob at night over,
you gave me as like, a toy.

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:02.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.650
It's like, where's the
inflatable drunk of a husband

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:05.010
toy?

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:07.176
Because why don't we just
round this whole life out?

00:07:07.176 --> 00:07:08.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:11.592
And so, I needed to
make money as a kid.

00:07:11.592 --> 00:07:13.800
You know, for candy and
lipgloss, or whatever we were

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.550
raising money for at that time.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.641
And I saw all the boys
being altar boys, right?

00:07:18.641 --> 00:07:20.640
And I was like, well
that's a way to make money.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.960
They were like raking it in.

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.280
Serving at weddings
and funerals.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.990
You know, apparently you didn't
get paid for like, the Sunday

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.990
Mass thing.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.290
So when I went to the
priest and I said,

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:35.190
I want to be an altar boy,
the priest freaked out.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:38.655
And said-- pulled out of his
ass, literally-- he goes,

00:07:38.655 --> 00:07:39.720
well you can't because--

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.980
And then I can see,
you know how adults

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.355
go like this, when they like,
don't have anything to say.

00:07:43.355 --> 00:07:44.430
He was like, doing that.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:47.790
And he was like, well you
know, it's called altar boy.

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:50.094
So, obviously.

00:07:50.094 --> 00:07:52.260
I was like, well-- and I
wasn't trying to be a jerk.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.860
I was just trying to get to
make money at the weddings.

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:57.410
That's what I wanted to do.

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.210
And so I said, well, you know,
you can call me an altar girl.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:04.050
And then he was like,
well, you know, you should

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:05.830
you should write the Archbishop.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:06.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.410
Just passing the buck, right?

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:12.360
So I got a petition and
I wrote the Archbishop.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:17.040
And like, not long after I wrote
the Archbishop, unfortunately

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.440
during Lent the Archbishop
had too much to drink

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.410
and plowed into the
wall of a 7-Eleven.

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:24.900
So the Archbishop had his
own problems to deal with

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.580
and wasn't concerned about
letting me be an altar boy.

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:30.450
But at that point I just was
like, I had this little case

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:31.780
of like, I don't get it.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.710
I don't get why I'm a girl
and I can't be an altar boy.

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:36.000
This is dumb.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.570
And so there was just instances
in life in general where--

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:43.590
if there was a clear
explanation like,

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:46.860
don't climb a tree
barefoot because that's

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:47.860
going to cut your feet.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.220
I'm like oh, that seems like
good advice from an adult.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:52.810
But if there was no real
explanation, I was just mad.

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:54.210
And because I was a curious kid.

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:57.240
And so there was just
a series of that shit

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.350
that started happening.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:01.800
And then, somebody said--
you know, I got cynical.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.450
And then I would
be a little snarky.

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:05.449
And then somebody said,
you should try stand-up.

00:09:05.449 --> 00:09:06.480
When I was in college.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.880
And I thought-- and this was
a part that really got me.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.310
And I looked at the
landscape of stand-ups,

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:12.904
and sure there was
women doing it.

00:09:12.904 --> 00:09:14.070
There was like, Joan Rivers.

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:16.140
And there was like,
Phyllis Diller.

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:17.430
But I didn't see myself.

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.160
I was like a punk-rock,
23-year-old kid,

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:25.020
and I didn't see my world
coming out of anybody's mouths.

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:26.640
And then I saw George Carlin.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.570
And so, it took a
dude to convince me

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.130
that I could do stand-up.

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:33.330
Which was a problem.

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.200
Like, the fact that
I did not see myself.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:42.930
And now it's so cool to see all
of these really amazing women

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:43.650
doing it.

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:44.910
But yeah.

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:46.930
So I started out, you
know, just doing it.

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:49.740
And I would do like,
I wasn't particularly

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:51.240
political at the time, you know?

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:55.380
I would have jokes
like, if you ever

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.050
play monopoly with bald guys
they always pick the hat.

00:09:58.050 --> 00:09:58.760
You know, stupid.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:02.711
That joke doesn't even
deserve that much laughter.

00:10:02.711 --> 00:10:03.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:04.084
I'm not even kidding.

00:10:04.084 --> 00:10:07.050
That was really nice
of you to do that.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:09.900
You know, and then I would
talk about gender and equity

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:10.950
or, you know, dating.

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:14.042
But it really wasn't--

00:10:14.042 --> 00:10:15.000
I cared about politics.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.250
I was very, like, I read
about it and I knew about it,

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:20.100
but I didn't bring it to stage.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:25.590
And then-- I guess if there
was like, the true comedy,

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:27.120
how did it change everything?

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.620
It would have to be--

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:29.721
oh my God.

00:10:29.721 --> 00:10:30.720
I can swear here, right?

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.240
And stuff?

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.030
JAIME GREEN: You have been.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:32.220
LIZZ WINSTEAD: Oh.

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:32.653
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:32.653 --> 00:10:33.086
JAIME GREEN: So--

00:10:33.086 --> 00:10:33.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:34.936
LIZZ WINSTEAD:
Guess I should have

00:10:34.936 --> 00:10:37.380
asked about 10 minutes ago.

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:40.540
I had moved to New York in 1991.

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.790
And somebody set me
up on a blind date.

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:44.020
And-- do you remember those?

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:45.020
They were-- it happened.

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:45.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.220
Like, they don't exist now
because you just hook up

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:49.450
with people you regret later.

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:50.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:51.790
On your phone.

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:53.110
But there was a thing.

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:55.045
And it was like,
it never was the--

00:10:55.045 --> 00:10:56.545
you know, I've got
a person for you.

00:10:56.545 --> 00:10:57.610
Actually, you don't.

00:10:57.610 --> 00:10:59.972
But I would go because
I'm from the Midwest.

00:10:59.972 --> 00:11:02.430
And when someone says, you
know, I have the person for you,

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:04.096
you're like, all right
well that's nice.

00:11:04.096 --> 00:11:06.670
I'll go do that because
you invited me, right?

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:10.750
So the guy shows up at my house.

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:13.570
And, you know, like
what's the plan?

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:16.300
I'm like, well maybe do you
want to go see La Dolce Vita?

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.430
I'd never seen it
on a big screen.

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:21.760
And he looks at me and he's
like, isn't that, like,

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.780
in black and white?

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:24.970
And I was like, oh man.

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:26.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.810
And if that wasn't
bad enough, he

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:35.110
is wearing a Yankees hat
and a Yankees satin jacket.

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:35.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:38.070
And I have a theory
about guys that

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:40.710
wear more than one
piece of sports clothing

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:41.610
at the same time.

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:43.660
And that is that they
won't go down on you.

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:44.552
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:44.552 --> 00:11:46.540
I believe this is
a proven thing.

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:55.226
I just-- So I'm like, this
is like, a double whammy.

00:11:55.226 --> 00:11:57.350
But I'm going to do it
because I'm from the Midwest

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:59.420
and I'm nice.

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:00.780
So we go to the movie.

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:02.000
And then the guy--

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.342
this is going somewhere, people.

00:12:03.342 --> 00:12:04.300
The story, I swear God.

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:06.950
I know you're like,
she is prattling on.

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:10.970
And the guy keeps falling asleep
and then rubbing his satin

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:12.830
jacket up and down my arm.

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:14.790
And I'm just like,
eating my popcorn

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:17.150
and like, getting
more and more rageful.

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:21.710
To the point where I was like,
fighting internally, my like,

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:22.520
I'm real nice.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.080
And I fucking hate this guy.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.630
I'm real-- [NOISES]

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:29.810
So finally I just took my
greasy hand and I just like,

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:32.780
purposefully hit his
jacket to wake him up.

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:35.090
And then I felt horribly.

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:36.590
I just felt horrible
that I actually

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:37.840
wrecked his jacket on purpose.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.870
And then, so I had to
make up for it by saying,

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:41.120
wake up let's go have a drink!

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.530
Continuing this night!

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:44.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:48.270
So we go to a bar that he knew
about because he watched sports

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:49.440
there.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.650
But on this night,
there was no sports

00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:54.800
on because it was the night
of the first Gulf War.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.470
And if you'll remember, you
won't because you probably

00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:58.450
weren't born, but

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:00.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:01.970
It was the first
time that America

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:08.090
watched, like, a war like unfold
in their living rooms, live.

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:12.170
And they had replaced like,
the regular anchors on CNN

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:14.449
with like, handsome people.

00:13:14.449 --> 00:13:15.740
And there was that green light.

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:20.450
And people were very, I'm
Dirk Sturdy on the roof.

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:21.280
And the bombs.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.180
And it was like--

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:24.140
I just watched it.

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:26.720
And I wasn't trying to wax
philosophical, I was just

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.630
taking in thinking, are
they reporting on a war

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:31.890
or trying to sell me a war?

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:35.430
And about two minutes
later the date was like,

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.350
this is really awesome.

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:43.410
And I was like, this
is a fucking problem.

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:46.100
And so I just sort of
started from that moment

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.710
on, like, paying more
attention to the media.

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:51.101
Seeing the information
that like, I was getting.

00:13:51.101 --> 00:13:53.600
Seeing what kind of, like, are
they just reporting the press

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.710
releases from the White House?

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:55.880
Like, what can I talk about?

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:56.360
What can I not?

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:56.900
You know.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:59.480
And so my comedy act started
changing dramatically,

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:05.300
talking a lot about not only
America's role in the world,

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:08.030
politics in general, but
also the media's role in how

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:09.680
all of that played out.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.800
And when I realized, as we
started getting ourselves

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:17.090
into these big, manipulative
wars, that the media was

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:18.080
as complicit as any.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.600
I mean, literally
when your network

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:24.380
is reporting on the
news and doing reports

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:25.850
about the negotiations
of whether

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:27.260
or not we're going to go to war.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:28.860
And then when they
go to commercial

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:31.610
there's a giant graphic that
says, countdown to the war.

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:34.190
You're like, are we negotiating?

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:35.840
Or do you know
something I don't know?

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:38.060
Because you literally have a
theme song and a graphic that

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:39.810
says, we're counting
down to the war, not,

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:42.830
we're negotiating to see if
we're going to go to war.

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:45.590
So I did a couple
of one-woman shows.

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:49.430
And then I was like,
trying to figure out

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:50.820
what I was going to do next.

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:57.290
And I worked on Jon Stewart's
first talk show as a producer.

00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:00.890
And when that got canceled,
a small group of that team

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:03.050
was asked by our executives
who had moved over

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:07.160
to Comedy Central, if we
wanted to launch a show that

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.760
responded to the world.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.790
And I was like, oh my
God, are you kidding me?

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:14.150
I am like, a person
who can barely type.

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:15.440
And I've never run any show.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.600
And all I do is
spout out my mouth.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.130
But yes, it's kind of my dream.

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:25.100
And so "The Daily
Show" was born.

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:28.700
And created by a whole bunch of
people who had a lot of passion

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:33.660
for exposing hypocrisy
and being funny.

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:37.034
And well, you know, there it is.

00:15:37.034 --> 00:15:38.450
It's been on the
air for 20 years.

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:40.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:41.240
It did good.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.800
JAIME GREEN: Yeah.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.440
Something I'm curious
about in your work

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.440
before "The Daily Show,"
"The Daily Show" and after.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:53.190
It's-- you know, you said that
they wanted you guys to create

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:55.430
a show that was responding to--

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:56.430
LIZZ WINSTEAD: The news.

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:58.080
JAIME GREEN: The news, yeah.

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:01.140
And so you use comedy to
talk about politics and world

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:02.070
events.

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:03.960
But in "The Daily Show"
and your other work

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.410
it's also using politics
and world events

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:07.642
as the fodder for comedy--

00:16:07.642 --> 00:16:08.850
LIZZ WINSTEAD: As the-- yeah.

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:10.980
And also as the fodder
for the media, you know.

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:13.920
It can't be stressed
enough how much

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:16.530
the media has played a role
through all of this, you know?

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:20.100
How much cable news-- and
as it bloated out more--

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:22.490
has been complicit in all of it.

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:24.110
So, yes.

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:26.820
But I think the problem
that I faced is that--

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:30.090
You know, after we
launched "The Daily Show"

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:34.500
and then I left and I went on
to do some other smaller shows.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:37.290
I did one on Oxygen
that was like, actually

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:39.070
a really funny show
that was six episodes.

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:41.070
It was like "The
Daily Show" meets

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:45.420
"Colbert" meets Kathie
Lee and whatever,

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:49.630
whoever those women are, it
was like, that kind of format.

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:51.450
And then we launched
Air America Radio.

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:52.200
JAIME GREEN: Yeah.

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:58.650
LIZZ WINSTEAD: And even
that, as out there as it

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:01.890
was, or as much freedom
as we had, should I say,

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:04.470
it was still part of an entity
that was a corporate entity.

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:07.950
And the bottom line is,
in all of these projects,

00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:11.730
I say this a lot but
it's true, I felt a lot

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:13.569
like an anger fluffer.

00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:15.720
Like I would just
get people riled up.

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:17.859
But it wasn't my job to
have a call to action.

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:19.500
So if I can be funny and
give people information.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:20.760
And they're like,
what do I do now?

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.369
And I'm like, I don't
know, I'm just a comedian.

00:17:22.369 --> 00:17:23.550
I'm just the writer.

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:25.109
I wanted to be
able to give people

00:17:25.109 --> 00:17:27.849
a place to channel the energy.

00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:31.110
And so that's why
I wrote a book.

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:33.270
And then after I
wrote the book, I

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:35.880
decided that I really wanted
to take all of the things

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:39.450
I care about, comedy social
justice, making a difference

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:42.090
through comedy and actually
then hitting the ground

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:44.770
and doing tangible work.

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:49.790
And the only way to do
that was to start a thing.

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:51.040
And I started this thing.

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:51.900
JAIME GREEN: And
so that brings us

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:53.210
to this thing, which is perfect.

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:53.730
LIZZ WINSTEAD: This
thing, this thing here.

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:54.075
Yeah.

00:17:54.075 --> 00:17:54.783
JAIME GREEN: Yes.

00:17:54.783 --> 00:17:57.930
So- because something I wonder
about with the lack of call

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:00.660
to actions, is, you know,
you'll see on Twitter

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:02.790
and social media nowadays
like, people saying like,

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:03.525
look at this.

00:18:03.525 --> 00:18:04.380
This is happening.

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:05.272
This is not normal.

00:18:05.272 --> 00:18:06.105
Don't be complacent.

00:18:06.105 --> 00:18:07.210
And I'm like, I'm not.

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:08.296
What do I do?

00:18:08.296 --> 00:18:09.170
LIZZ WINSTEAD: Right.

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:10.650
JAIME GREEN: So what sort of--

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:14.280
how are you moving from just
raising people's awareness

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:18.960
of what's going on to actually
giving them tools or helping

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.460
them figure out
what they can do?

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:22.334
LIZZ WINSTEAD: Well I
think one of the things

00:18:22.334 --> 00:18:26.640
that's important for me
is, A, figuring out--

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:32.100
when you sign up to volunteer
for us, for example, we ask you

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:33.570
how much time you have to give?

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:35.410
What your skill set is?

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:37.590
And then we can make that work.

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:39.960
Also like, for example,
on the women's march.

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:43.200
It's a-- we had an activist
fair that we sponsored.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.790
Where we had 15 tables.

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:48.780
It was right off the march path
at a hotel called the UN Hotel.

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:50.845
We did it here, in
New York, because I

00:18:50.845 --> 00:18:53.220
felt like, I don't want to go
to D.C. I want to stay here

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:55.512
because a lot of the
policies that people

00:18:55.512 --> 00:18:57.720
are going to be affected
by-- those people live here.

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.970
You know, we have strong
immigrant population.

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:01.331
Strong undocumented population.

00:19:01.331 --> 00:19:01.830
Women.

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:03.250
You know, all of it.

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:05.970
And so we had 15
different organizations

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:10.969
representing 15 different ways
that you could participate,

00:19:10.969 --> 00:19:13.260
whether it was environmental,
racial justice, you know,

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.980
whatever it was.

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:16.920
And sort of our
rule was, your group

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.470
has to be able to let
people like, get in there

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:20.310
and do some work.

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:23.050
You know, not just sign
up, not just give us money,

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:25.020
like, because I think
that's important.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:28.710
And so what we do is, for
example, if you wanted

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:32.670
to volunteer with us, there's a
myriad of things you could do.

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:35.610
You can-- we sign,
we send postcards

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:37.392
to clinics throughout the year.

00:19:37.392 --> 00:19:38.850
And then we have,
four times a year

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:40.600
we have orchestrated
postcard programs

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.789
where sending them love really
makes all the difference

00:19:43.789 --> 00:19:44.330
in the world.

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:46.280
So, you know, that's a
simple thing we can do.

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:48.570
We help legislatively, like
everybody else does, where

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:50.340
you can sign this petition.

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:53.770
For example, a-- this is crazy.

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:55.740
So we've worked with
a clinic in Ohio.

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:58.500
We went to Ohio to help
out during the Republican

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:02.520
Convention because part of
the activities for the RNC

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.170
was to go protest a clinic.

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:05.790
They had, I mean, insane.

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:09.300
So this clinic that we had
befriended, and now work with,

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:12.290
someone stole their fence.

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:13.902
A psychotic person
had been, like,

00:20:13.902 --> 00:20:15.110
chipping away at their fence.

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:16.679
And just stole their fence.

00:20:16.679 --> 00:20:18.470
They came to work and
their fence was gone.

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:23.510
So we were able to do a Facebook
Live event where we went on

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:26.180
and we said, this clinic
had their fence stolen,

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:28.710
they need $10,000 to do it.

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:30.312
Here's the origin story.

00:20:30.312 --> 00:20:32.270
We put the origin story
out, we told the thing,

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:35.150
and the clinic said, you
guys just raised us money

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:36.290
to buy a new fence.

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:37.550
In five hours.

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:42.410
So when we pay attention to the
needs of each of these places,

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:44.960
we can specifically tailor.

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:47.150
If we need graphic
design work, if a clinic

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:49.880
needs graphic design work
for something they're doing.

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:52.160
If you want to
help us with meals.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:53.840
I mean, this tour
that we're going on,

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.440
we're launching this tour today.

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.856
You know, it's like, we're
launching a fundraiser with it.

00:20:57.856 --> 00:20:58.970
Because we need a van.

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:03.110
We're taking 11 bodies
to go and grow community

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:06.920
in 16 different cities where
a clinic is desperately

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:10.640
needing support that will
last long after we show up.

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:15.020
So, one of the things
that's really kind of cool

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:18.410
is, we created a system
where we'll do a comedy music

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:20.360
show in a town, we
have a talk back

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.216
with the provider and
maybe somebody who

00:21:22.216 --> 00:21:24.590
runs an escort program or
somebody who runs that abortion

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:26.960
fund in that state.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.640
After they laugh and
hear music they'll

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:32.780
hear a Q&amp;A, that's like this,
they'll be less questions,

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:35.150
and they can sign up
to help the clinic out.

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:39.670
So does that mean you bring
cupcakes four times a year?

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:41.810
Does that mean you help
them with hot breakfast

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:44.060
on the Saturday morning when
there's a lot of clinics?

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:46.520
Does that mean you sign
up to escort yourself?

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:49.610
Does that mean that
you get together,

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:52.700
and then you can
reach out to us,

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:55.260
and say, we're trying to
figure out a creative action.

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:55.927
Can you help us?

00:21:55.927 --> 00:21:57.218
And we're like, sure, you know.

00:21:57.218 --> 00:21:59.750
We've helped people with like,
everybody wear hospital gowns

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:01.625
and go sit in your state
legislator's office.

00:22:01.625 --> 00:22:03.205
And just wait for
your Pap smear.

00:22:03.205 --> 00:22:04.580
And they just sit
there and wait.

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:05.810
And when they come out and
say, what are you doing here?

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:07.601
We're like, well we're
here for a pap smear

00:22:07.601 --> 00:22:10.115
since you absolutely
know how my body works.

00:22:10.115 --> 00:22:11.990
I'd like you to actually
give me a Pap smear.

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:14.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:16.340
And so, you know,
helping people get

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:20.640
creative with their local
actions is really great.

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:23.600
And so we are
constantly looking for,

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:27.069
you know, people who can fill
our creative pot so that--

00:22:27.069 --> 00:22:29.360
you know, because a lot of
plates are spinning at once.

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:30.500
So if we're trying
to help out Indiana,

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.130
somebody says, I'm creative.

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:32.870
And like, great.

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:33.810
There's a thing
in Ohio, you know,

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:35.870
and you can really help
us like, do this thing.

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:36.750
Or whatever it is.

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:37.680
So, yeah.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:38.540
JAIME GREEN: Yeah.

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:42.267
The specificity and the concrete
action there is amazing.

00:22:42.267 --> 00:22:43.100
LIZZ WINSTEAD: Yeah.

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:44.420
JAIME GREEN: Before I move
on to my next question,

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:46.550
we're going to be opening
it up for audience questions

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:47.070
in a minute.

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:48.900
So if you want to
ask a question,

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:51.380
just go line up behind
one of those microphones

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:54.140
so that we know that
you have a question.

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.670
We'll get to that in one second.

00:22:56.670 --> 00:23:00.230
But first, in addition
to these very specific,

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:05.090
local, on-the-ground efforts,
you're also doing a lot online.

00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:06.649
Through social
media, through video,

00:23:06.649 --> 00:23:08.190
can you talk a little
bit about that?

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:10.340
LIZZ WINSTEAD: Yeah and maybe we
should show one of our videos.

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:10.710
So--

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:11.700
JAIME GREEN: What
a fantastic segue.

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:13.283
LIZZ WINSTEAD: What
a fantastic segue.

00:23:13.283 --> 00:23:19.280
So we, one of the greatest joys
is to dispel myths in a way

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:20.780
that people really latch on to.

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:24.530
One of the greatest myths
in reproductive health care

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:30.050
is that Plan B and
IUDs are abortions.

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:32.960
There was a Supreme Court
case called Hobby Lobby where

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.755
this Christian craft
store, I don't even

00:23:34.755 --> 00:23:35.630
know what that means,

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:37.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:40.850
Decided that they
didn't want to disperse

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:45.980
birth control if the birth
control was promoting abortion.

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.580
And they listed Plan
B on their list.

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:51.050
And it's like, Plan B does
not, not only does not

00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:53.360
promote abortion,
it stops an egg

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:59.854
from actually leaving the
egg holder, scientific term,

00:23:59.854 --> 00:24:00.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:02.010
In the first place.

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:05.119
So in order to like, lay this
shit down once and for all,

00:24:05.119 --> 00:24:06.410
we're like, let's make a video.

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:07.760
So we decided to make a cartoon.

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:10.160
And we got a Lea DeLaria from
"Orange Is the New Black"

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:14.300
to be the voice of Plan B.
And we'll just roll the,

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:15.215
we'll roll the video.

00:24:15.215 --> 00:24:15.965
JAIME GREEN: Yeah.

00:24:15.965 --> 00:24:19.435
LIZZ WINSTEAD: You'll
learn a little something.

00:24:19.435 --> 00:24:20.433
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:24:20.433 --> 00:24:25.423
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:37.630
- Sorry, ma'am.

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:40.750
I have to get another
cashier to sell you Plan B.

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:41.620
- Why?

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:43.864
- Because Plan B
causes abortion.

00:24:43.864 --> 00:24:45.280
And I don't have
to sell it to you

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:48.200
because abortion goes
against my religious beliefs.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.330
- Wait, It's not an abortion.

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:54.640
And double wait, a cashier
can deny me birth control?

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.200
- You are a correct, ma'am.

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.930
That is actually the law.

00:24:57.930 --> 00:24:59.620
And I don't like it.

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:01.642
Listen up Mr. Cashier.

00:25:01.642 --> 00:25:03.490
[SINGING] I'm just a pill.

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:05.170
A kind of birth control pill.

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:08.080
No matter what they
say on Capitol Hill.

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:13.170
Well it's a wrong, wrong story
they keep telling about me.

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:16.250
A strong, strong lie, all
I do is block pregnancy.

00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:18.940
I wish they'd listen
to what scientists say.

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:21.950
So at the end of the
day, you can chill.

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:22.750
Drop some facts.

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:25.990
Tell the world, I'm a pill.

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:27.010
- Gosh, Pill.

00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:29.480
Preventing an unwanted
pregnancy seems so helpful.

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:32.210
How'd you get so many enemies?

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:35.210
- Well, a lot of
folks like this fella,

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:37.620
got together and decided
that I cause abortions.

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:38.732
But I don't.

00:25:38.732 --> 00:25:41.480
I stop ovulation from
happening, preventing

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:44.273
fertilization and pregnancy.

00:25:44.273 --> 00:25:47.230
- Wait, a fertilized
egg isn't a pregnancy?

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:48.520
- No.

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:51.470
After an egg is fertilized,
it takes 72 whole hours

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:55.350
for the egg to make its way to
the uterus and implant itself.

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:57.470
That is a pregnancy.

00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:00.140
My job is to stop the
egg from ever traveling

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:04.310
to Fallopian Tower,
preventing that pregnancy.

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:06.470
- So life doesn't
being at conception?

00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:11.240
- When life begins
is an opinion.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:15.120
When pregnancy begins
is a scientific fact.

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:17.580
Are you get getting it yet?

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:18.445
- Kind of.

00:26:18.445 --> 00:26:21.182
- Well, think of it
like a football game.

00:26:21.182 --> 00:26:23.390
The quarterback drops back
and tosses to the receiver

00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:24.963
at the 20 yard line.

00:26:24.963 --> 00:26:27.090
The fertilization
happens the second

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:29.088
the receiver catches the ball.

00:26:29.088 --> 00:26:30.760
Now, we all know the rules.

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:33.352
The fertilized egg still needs
to make it into the end zone

00:26:33.352 --> 00:26:34.196
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:34.196 --> 00:26:35.886
Before it's a touchdown.

00:26:35.886 --> 00:26:38.962
But, if there is
no ball to catch--

00:26:38.962 --> 00:26:41.270
- There can never
be a touchdown.

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:42.270
- Now you're getting it!

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:45.750
Doctors say pregnancy doesn't
happen until the touchdown.

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:49.130
So my job is to block that
touchdown from happening.

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:50.048
And I do.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:56.400
- Wow Plan B!

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.033
You're like the Deion Sanders
of preventing pregnancy.

00:26:59.033 --> 00:26:59.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:05.410
- Actually, Deion Sanders wishes
he was the Plan B of football.

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:07.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:09.070
Well, I hope that
cleared things up.

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:11.330
But just in case it didn't,

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:12.740
[SINGING] I'm just a pill.

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:14.420
A helpful birth control pill.

No matter what they
say on Capitol Hill.

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:21.740
So now you know my truth,
I'm all about prevention.

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:26.240

I'm here for intervention.

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:40.560

abortions then anyone I know.

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:43.370

you to customers.

00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:44.690

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:54.400

to you this way, kid.

Even if you're a teenager.

00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:08.500
Oh, and just one more thing,
I know I'm awesome but please,

[APPLAUSE]

00:28:40.597 --> 00:28:42.680
It was really important
for us to make that video.

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:47.030
Especially with Neil
Gorsuch, who is, as you know,

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:49.600
in line to possibly be the
next Supreme Court Justice.

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:53.080
And he is somebody who ruled
in the lower court for Hobby

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:55.390

the fake science

00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:57.370
that-- so, you know,
so we put it out.

00:28:57.370 --> 00:29:00.670
And it's also, for me,
really important the line

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:03.220
about teenagers, you know.

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:04.759
It's good to make
video sometimes

00:29:04.759 --> 00:29:06.550
that kids can pass
around to their friends.

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:09.040
And they can know that
I can go get that if I'm

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:11.770
a teen and my condom broke.

00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:14.629
That I can go test that out.

00:29:14.629 --> 00:29:16.920
Because I think a lot of
times we don't let our teens--

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:20.650
we deny sexuality of teens, and
especially teen girls, so much.

00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:24.622
And I think it's important
to be living in the world

00:29:24.622 --> 00:29:26.830
where there's not abstinence
and unicorns, in the one

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:27.970
where there's actually sex.

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:30.370
And sometimes
unintended pregnancy.

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:32.960

real and help people out.

information for teens

00:29:50.007 --> 00:29:51.090
were it's like, hey teens.

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:52.810
You can go get this
over the counter.

00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:58.422
And it also has information for
people who are already thinking

00:29:58.422 --> 00:29:59.380
and arguing about this.

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:02.350
Like the-- something I haven't
heard before is the distinction

00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:03.760
between when does life begin--

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:03.880
LIZZ WINSTEAD: Yes!

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:05.796
JAIME GREEN: Versus when
does pregnancy begin?

00:30:05.796 --> 00:30:09.250
Because anyone can say, well,
I think life starts here,

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:11.260
I think it starts there.

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:11.530
LIZZ WINSTEAD: Look, sperm move.

00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:12.029
That's life.

00:30:12.029 --> 00:30:13.000
Is that a person?

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:13.875
You know what I mean?

00:30:13.875 --> 00:30:18.940
Like, when life begins
literally is this subjective--

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:20.381
and life begins at conception?

00:30:20.381 --> 00:30:21.630
That is not a scientific term.

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:22.450
That's a medical--

00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:24.580
I mean, that's a religious term.

00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:26.500
You know, fertilization
is conception.

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.885
And so it still
needs that, you know.

00:30:28.885 --> 00:30:31.900
As we show this video, if you
just figured that out now,

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:32.440
don't worry.

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:33.939
Most people are
like, I had no idea.

00:30:33.939 --> 00:30:35.112
It's like, it's OK.

00:30:35.112 --> 00:30:36.070
A lot of people didn't.

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:39.430
In fact, we thought Plan
B stopped an implantation

00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:40.060
from happening.

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:41.768
But it turns out that's
not what it does.

00:30:41.768 --> 00:30:44.399
So there's like, misnomers
around that as well.

00:30:44.399 --> 00:30:45.940
So we wanted to make
sure that people

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:48.650
knew that it stops the egg from
actually leaving the fallopian

00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:49.650
tube in the first place.

00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:53.347
So it was approved because
they thought it might

00:30:53.347 --> 00:30:54.430
have stopped implantation.

00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:55.840
And here's what's crazy.

00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:59.320
The website of Plan B says
that, and it's not right.

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:02.620
So we consulted with
a team of physicians

00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:04.490
to actually make
sure it was right.

00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:06.490
So I'm like, so
the football thing?

00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:08.590
Is it cool if like, it
gets shot out of the thing?

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:09.820
And they're like,
yeah, it's fine.

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:10.420
So it was--

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:11.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:14.800
Like having them help
us write it into plain,

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:15.580
into medical text.

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:18.190
And then having us translate
it into fallopian town

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:19.293
and all this other shit.

00:31:19.293 --> 00:31:20.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:20.749
Was kind of fun.

00:31:20.749 --> 00:31:22.790
JAIME GREEN: Yeah, well,
because in a lot of ways

00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:25.620
the anti-abortion
movement has really

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:28.447
controlled the rhetoric of
how we talk about things.

00:31:28.447 --> 00:31:29.280
LIZZ WINSTEAD: 110%.

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:33.090
And that can be incredibly
damaging, incredibly shaming.

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:36.660
And, you know, it's like, things
that our very good friends will

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:39.050
say are sometimes like--

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:41.490
on a larger scale it
can make people wonder.

00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:43.577
When they say like, well
no one's for abortion.

00:31:43.577 --> 00:31:44.160
You know what?

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:46.140
Except for people
who need an abortion.

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:46.920
You know.

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.884
Like, I say often, there
are no good abortions,

00:31:48.884 --> 00:31:50.550
there are no bad
abortions, there's just

00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:52.006
the abortion that you need.

00:31:52.006 --> 00:31:53.880
And I think that we need
to bear that in mind

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:56.480
as somebody is going
through that choice

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:59.070
to terminate a pregnancy.

00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:03.990
That lobbing judgment
or saying things like,

00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:07.590
that I'm pro-choice,
I'm not pro-abortion.

00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:09.900
You know, why is it
that you say that?

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:14.220
By saying that it sounds like
abortion is a dirty thing

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:15.500
that has to happen.

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:17.910
When-- if one in three women
statistically will have

00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:20.430
an abortion in her
reproductive lifetime--

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:23.940
it sounds to me like that's
a piece of medical care

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:26.020
that a lot of people
are going to need.

00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:30.720
And so for us to put a caveat
or a shaming space on that,

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:37.290
based on this assault of
dis-information medically--

00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:39.870
We need to examine that as
people who are advocates

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:42.520
for, you know, full autonomy.

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:45.499
And if you believe that women's
rights are human rights,

00:32:45.499 --> 00:32:47.790
one of the first rights that
we should all be defending

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:51.510
is how and if and when
you want to have kids.

00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:54.569
And make sure you have full
autonomy over your body.

00:32:54.569 --> 00:32:55.473
JAIME GREEN: Yeah.

00:32:55.473 --> 00:32:57.014
LIZZ WINSTEAD: That's
what I believe.

00:32:57.014 --> 00:33:01.904
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:01.904 --> 00:33:04.296
JAIME GREEN: I just entirely
lost my train of thought.

00:33:04.296 --> 00:33:05.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:06.460
LIZZ WINSTEAD: Because
you're thinking about that

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:07.830
penis shooting
out that football.

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:08.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:08.900
JAIME GREEN: It's
very distracting.

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.340
LIZZ WINSTEAD: I
know, it's true.

00:33:13.371 --> 00:33:14.870
JAIME GREEN: One
question, something

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:17.431
that's been in the news lately,
among all the many garbage

00:33:17.431 --> 00:33:17.930
fires--

00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:18.485
LIZZ WINSTEAD: Yes,
so much garbage fire.

00:33:18.485 --> 00:33:21.026
JAIME GREEN: And especially in
the aftermath of the election,

00:33:21.026 --> 00:33:24.720
is the question of
whether abortion rights

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:30.819
and reproductive freedom should
be a non-negotiable issue

00:33:30.819 --> 00:33:31.860
in the Democratic Party--

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:32.651
LIZZ WINSTEAD: Yes.

00:33:32.651 --> 00:33:33.780
JAIME GREEN: --on the left.

00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:37.302
If it's-- if you
can be, you know,

00:33:37.302 --> 00:33:41.927
on the left and not pro-choice?

00:33:41.927 --> 00:33:44.260
I mean, I'm going to ask what
are your thoughts on that?

00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:45.880
I think I know what your
thoughts are on that,

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:47.588
but I'd love to hear
you talk about that.

00:33:47.588 --> 00:33:49.770
LIZZ WINSTEAD: Well I just
wrote a massive piece.

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:54.680
There was an article in
"The New York Times," that

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:57.830
just was in "The New York
Times," where a woman wrote

00:33:57.830 --> 00:34:00.230
that there was-- it was
alienating in the women's

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:04.340
movement if you are not an
abortion rights advocate.

00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:07.290
And what I say to
that is simple.

00:34:07.290 --> 00:34:11.449
You can totally be somebody
who has personal feelings

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:12.560
about abortion.

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:16.040
The bottom line is, we
live in a secular society

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:18.590
where abortion is safer than
having your teeth pulled.

00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:22.400
And if you are going to advocate
against a procedure that

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:25.280
is going to literally clear
a path for someone to pursue

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.350
their own destiny, then no.

00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:28.639
That is problematic for me.

00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:30.780
And that is problematic
for a movement as a whole.

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:34.239
If you say you are a woman's
right advocate, or a person

00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:36.889
with a uterus
advocate, that means

00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:41.178
that you have to actually
put your feelings aside.

00:34:41.178 --> 00:34:43.219
Because your feelings are
your personal feelings.

00:34:43.219 --> 00:34:45.080
And when you search
your soul, you

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:46.940
are searching your
soul for yourself.

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:49.889
I do not need you to search
your soul and tell me

00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:52.040
you've come up with a
solution, medically,

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.249
for what I need to do.

00:34:53.249 --> 00:34:55.790
That is wrong and that is not
being a feminist and that's not

00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:57.260
part of the feminist movement.

00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:58.340
It shouldn't be.

00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:00.217
So that's how I feel about it.

00:35:00.217 --> 00:35:01.550
JAIME GREEN: Do you think that--

00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:03.383
LIZZ WINSTEAD: I'm
reading the comments now.

00:35:03.383 --> 00:35:04.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:08.510
JAIME GREEN: Do you think
that opposition to abortion

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:10.310
primarily comes from
a religious place?

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:13.160
Or is there something else,
cultural or psychological?

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:15.830
Because people give--
politicians and people

00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:18.290
who are anti-abortion
will give lots of reasons.

00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:20.811
It's usually religious, I think?

00:35:20.811 --> 00:35:23.060
LIZZ WINSTEAD: Well I think
when you hear things like,

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:25.789
life begins at
conception, again,

00:35:25.789 --> 00:35:26.830
that's a religious thing.

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:29.750
Yeah, I mean, almost all
the time it's religious.

00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:32.240
And the thing that is--

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:35.840
it goes back to what you
said, of the people who

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:40.640
are anti-abortion, who have
driven the narrative to places

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:44.360
where we just let things go.

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:45.340
Junk science.

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:48.110
There is-- like, abortion
causes breast cancer.

00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:49.460
Proven it doesn't.

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:52.250
By every medical establishment
that you can find.

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:54.680
That it causes mental illness.

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:57.560
Again, not proven in
any way, shape or form.

00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:58.231
Sterility.

00:35:58.231 --> 00:35:58.730
No.

00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:01.700
People have multiple
abortions, therefore not true.

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:04.010
So those things just lay there.

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:06.590
And on top of that,
we have states where--

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:07.250
Indiana.

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:09.350
Prime example when Mike
Pence was governor.

00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:12.020
He de-funded Planned
Parenthood on a state level.

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:13.520
Those Planned
Parenthood went under.

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:15.227
He gave that $4
million every year

00:36:15.227 --> 00:36:17.060
that went to Planned
Parenthood to something

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:18.410
called Crisis Pregnancy Centers.

00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:19.951
If you're not aware
of what they are,

00:36:19.951 --> 00:36:23.870
they're unregulated clinics,
opened up by religious people,

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:25.400
who--

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:26.930
anybody can wander in.

00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:28.460
Somebody dressed
up in a lab coat,

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:32.612
who could probably just work at
the Macy's Lancome counter too,

00:36:32.612 --> 00:36:34.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:36.880
Gives people this information.

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:39.470
Will give them an
ultrasound that is--

00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:42.020
they might fudge how
far along they are.

00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:45.140
They may say, yeah, we'll help
you with diapers and cribs.

00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:46.520
Just keep coming back.

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:49.160
And then when they're
past the age of being,

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:52.050
the gestational age to have
an abortion, all of a sudden,

00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:52.880
they disappear.

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:55.100
They won't give the
person anything.

00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:55.940
They're horrible.

00:36:55.940 --> 00:37:02.180
And so, in the course of funding
those unregulated centers,

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:04.530
people are being denied care.

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:06.590
And also, in the
case of Indiana,

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:09.290
they had this outbreak of HIV.

00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:12.415
87 cases of HIV in
this county in Indiana.

00:37:12.415 --> 00:37:13.790
And the Planned
Parenthood clinic

00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:16.850
used to be somebody
that would treat

00:37:16.850 --> 00:37:19.501
sexually transmitted diseases,
help people with HIV.

00:37:19.501 --> 00:37:21.000
And there was no
Planned Parenthood.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.140
So they actually had to
do pop-up clinics when

00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:25.545
they had a system in place.

00:37:25.545 --> 00:37:26.420
Just because of this.

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:29.750
So I think that
those things are--

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:32.420
for the most part we see
it's a religious argument

00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:34.580
because the medical--

00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:38.540
every single piece of medicine
around the issue of abortion

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:41.150
bears out to it being
one of the safest things.

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:43.670
One of the-- and
not preventing you

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:46.340
from choosing to have
a family in the future.

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:49.730
So when they start placing these
caveats, especially when it's

00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:52.220
waiting periods and
things like that,

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:55.010
and they say it's all
for the woman's, you

00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:57.450
know, just to make sure.

00:37:57.450 --> 00:37:59.330
When you start laying
things down like,

00:37:59.330 --> 00:38:02.210
we need women to wait.

00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:04.850
Because we're not sure she's
made the right decision.

00:38:04.850 --> 00:38:08.660
When that becomes part of the
norm in our society, that--

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:11.690
if anybody's ever had the
fear of being pregnant

00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:14.390
and didn't want to be
or actually has been,

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:16.520
you know from the
second you might

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:18.500
think that you're
pregnant, you're

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:20.330
thinking about it constantly.

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:24.070
Everything about what that
pregnancy means to your life

00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:27.110
is thought through
over and over again.

00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:30.110
So to require extra time?

00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:34.470
Is society saying, we're not
really sure we trust women

00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:35.800
to make decisions?

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:40.642
And that goes out of the
abortion arena and goes into,

00:38:40.642 --> 00:38:43.050
should we really trust
women to run our company?

00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:43.550
You know.

00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:47.281
Should we really trust
women to be president?

00:38:47.281 --> 00:38:47.780
Would we?

00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:48.890
You know, I mean--

00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:51.000
So I think those things
are really telling.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.300
And things that we
should fight against,

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:56.470
while they might seem like
it's for the women, it's not.

00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:58.370
It's for the control.

00:38:58.370 --> 00:39:00.290
JAIME GREEN: Yeah.

00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:03.020
Last call for questions
from the audience.

00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:05.690
But in lieu of that,
something I want to ask

00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:10.250
is, on the Lady Parts
Justice League website

00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:12.800
you have a video
page with a video

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:15.200
for every state in the country.

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:16.977
That's on the Lady
Parts Justice page.

00:39:16.977 --> 00:39:17.810
JAIME GREEN: Oh, OK.

00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:18.560
LIZZ WINSTEAD: Not
the League page.

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:19.643
We have two organizations.

00:39:19.643 --> 00:39:20.340
One is a 501c4--

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:20.500
JAIME GREEN: OK, they
have very similar names.

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:21.950
LIZZ WINSTEAD: Which is
political, political,

00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:22.400
political.

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:23.022
JAIME GREEN: Gotcha.

00:39:23.022 --> 00:39:23.570
LIZZ WINSTEAD: Yes.

00:39:23.570 --> 00:39:24.580
It's sort of like
Planned Parenthood

00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:25.820
and Planned Parenthood Action.

00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:26.240
JAIME GREEN: Yes.

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:27.115
LIZZ WINSTEAD: Right?

00:39:27.115 --> 00:39:30.920
One deals with health
care outreach education.

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:32.540
Still swearing and being fun.

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:35.040
That pill video is
outreach education.

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.870
And then we have Lady Parts
Justice, which is-- yes.

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:39.380
Has a video for every state.

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:42.020
And you can go there and
learn about the, like, we

00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:43.356
call it politicians money.

00:39:43.356 --> 00:39:44.480
JAIME GREEN: OK so that's--

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:44.930
LIZZ WINSTEAD: Two
different things.

00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:45.245
JAIME GREEN: Political.

00:39:45.245 --> 00:39:45.560
LIZZ WINSTEAD: Yep.

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:46.340
JAIME GREEN: This one--

00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:47.030
LIZZ WINSTEAD: Yes.

00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:48.530
JAIME GREEN:
Informational, educational.

00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:49.529
LIZZ WINSTEAD: Yes, yes.

00:39:49.529 --> 00:39:51.947
So our big tour is through
the Lady Parts Justice League.

00:39:51.947 --> 00:39:52.780
JAIME GREEN: Gotcha.

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:54.571
LIZZ WINSTEAD: Because
we can hit the road,

00:39:54.571 --> 00:39:56.360
do outreach, roll up
our sleeves, do it.

00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:56.650
JAIME GREEN: Yes.

00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:58.900
LIZZ WINSTEAD: Go to the Lady
Parts Justice League website.

00:39:58.900 --> 00:39:59.608
JAIME GREEN: Yes.

00:39:59.608 --> 00:40:01.530
LIZZ WINSTEAD:
Donate to the tour.

00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:02.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:02.835
It's awesome.

00:40:02.835 --> 00:40:03.160
JAIME GREEN: Something--

00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:03.850
LIZZ WINSTEAD: And
see where we are!

00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:04.610
Come visit us!

00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:05.480
We're in 16 cities.

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:06.490
You probably live
in one of them.

00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:07.880
JAIME GREEN: Something
I wanted to ask

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:10.213
for the people in the audience
here who are in New York.

00:40:10.213 --> 00:40:12.890
We usually think of in New York
we've got things pretty good,

00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:14.120
nice blue state.

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:14.620
Lots of--

00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:15.453
LIZZ WINSTEAD: Yeah.

00:40:15.453 --> 00:40:16.994
JAIME GREEN: But
what challenges--

00:40:16.994 --> 00:40:18.160
LIZZ WINSTEAD: But it's not.

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:18.510
JAIME GREEN: Yeah.

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:20.450
So what should people
be aware of here?

00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:23.240
LIZZ WINSTEAD: In New York
state, funnily enough,

00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:28.120
we have not changed our
abortion law since 1970.

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:30.320
We have pre-Roe v. Wade
abortion laws in our state.

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:33.030
And while it feels like it's
blue and it's great here,

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:39.560
and the city abortion access is
pretty accessible, if you live

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:42.770
in another place, if you
live in rural New York,

00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:46.580
it's really hard for you
to access any kind of care.

00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:49.280
It's-- abortion laws were
set in the criminal code.

00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:53.840
So if you have a
fetal anomaly that--

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:56.750
oftentimes when you hear
about those big scary--

00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:59.510
they try to scare you with
like, late-term abortion

00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:00.570
and why people have them.

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:04.010
And in 99% of those
are because things

00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:06.270
don't happen
gestationally in pregnancy

00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:10.790
sometimes until the final
trimester of that pregnancy.

00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:13.220
And so, really horrible--
life threatening to the woman,

00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:16.591
the fetus won't live outside
of the womb, a lot of bad stuff

00:41:16.591 --> 00:41:17.090
happens.

00:41:17.090 --> 00:41:21.770
And so sometimes you won't
even know those things, right?

00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:25.400
In New York, if you hit
24 weeks and discover

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:32.630
that the fetus will, could cause
you death, could die itself,

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:34.070
you can't get an abortion.

00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:36.590
There is no life of the
mother, life of the fetus

00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:37.790
exception after 24 weeks.

00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:39.090
You have to leave the state.

00:41:39.090 --> 00:41:40.310
So, yeah.

00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:41.650
So that's like a law that is--

00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:42.440
JAIME GREEN: And that's
still in place now?

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:43.898
LIZZ WINSTEAD:
That's in place now.

00:41:43.898 --> 00:41:45.830
And they're fighting
for, we're fighting

00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:47.690
to change that law right now.

00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:51.980
But we have a, kind of
conservative, you know,

00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:53.630
a lot of conservatives
in Albany.

00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:56.130
Some of them are Democrats
who are anti-choice.

00:41:56.130 --> 00:42:00.110
So they won't update
these simple, simple laws

00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:02.340
that could be fixed.

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:05.490
And add logical exceptions
so people don't die.

00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:06.240
JAIME GREEN: Yeah.

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:07.400
LIZZ WINSTEAD: I don't
know, seems smart.

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.340
JAIME GREEN: Not dying
seems like a good thing.

00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:09.950
LIZZ WINSTEAD: Not dying
seems like-- living

00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:11.860
seems like a good
alternative to not dying.

00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:14.152
I don't know, I'm for that part.

00:42:14.152 --> 00:42:14.902
JAIME GREEN: Yeah.

00:42:14.902 --> 00:42:15.735
LIZZ WINSTEAD: Yeah.

00:42:15.735 --> 00:42:16.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:18.224
JAIME GREEN: All right
well, Lizz, thank you.

00:42:18.224 --> 00:42:18.975
Thank you so much.

00:42:18.975 --> 00:42:20.890
LIZZ WINSTEAD: Thank
you, it was really great.

00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:21.780
Thanks for having me.

00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:22.738
JAIME GREEN: Thank you.

00:42:22.738 --> 00:42:23.930
[APPLAUSE]
