00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This question is about both gravity and electricity.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Let's say that Benjamin Franklin is standing in a room holding an object.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This room actually has a horizontal electric field.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
That electric field is equal to 100 N/C.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Obviously, Ben Franklin is very excited, because he gets to do an experiment with electricity.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Furthermore, let's say that this ball has both a mass, 8 kg,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and it's actually charged as well.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It's charge is 0.1 C. That's a positive charge.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Now what's going to happen when he releases this ball is it will feel two forces.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It will, of course, feel a force from gravity downward,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
but it's also going to feel an electric force.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It's going to undergo 2-dimensional motion,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
but this will be much different than the 2-dimensional motion of a ball being thrown

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
in the air under normal circumstances,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
because now there's going to be a horizontal component of acceleration.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I want you to tell me if this height is equal to 1.2 m

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and we know that the ball will feel a force over here

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
so it'll probably land somewhere--I don't know--here or here or here.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I want you to tell me d--the distance away from Ben Franklin

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
where the ball strikes the ground.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
You can enter your answer here in meters.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I'm warning you this is quite a tricky question,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
but using what you know about F = ma and motion and electricity

00:01:21.000 --> 99:59:59.000
you can tie it all together, and I believe you can get this answer. Give it a shot.
