00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.830
If you run it on your phone, your Apple crashed

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.270
because of a network got main thread exception. We found

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.990
this answer by connecting our device to our computer and

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.790
then checking Android device monitor for the error. You can

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.220
see here that this is our package name and this

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.010
is our process ID. If you search the logs for

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.390
that process ID then our error appears. It's triggered ultimately

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.700
by a network on main thread exception. If you're curious

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.560
as to what line of our code actually caused

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.730
this, you can scroll down the stack trace to

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.940
read more. This is our framework code that you

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.570
can skip and here's where it actually hits our

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.440
app. It's within the placeholder fragment class, in the onCreateView method. And

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.680
it happens in main activity.java file, in line 116. So

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.650
if we go back to the code, on that line you can see that urlConnection.connect

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.210
actually caused the error, and that we can't do that on the main thread.
