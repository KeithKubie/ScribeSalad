00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:03.971
It's time to play Circus Folk.
Circus Folk.

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:05.939
(cheering)

00:00:05.973 --> 00:00:09.176
Big money. Big money.

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:10.811
Last week was
the 56th anniversary

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:14.414
of the debut
of <i>The Family Circus.</i>

00:00:14.448 --> 00:00:17.050
-Yeah, that's right.
-(laughter)

00:00:17.084 --> 00:00:18.352
Oh...

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:20.821
Uh, this is not a...
it's not...

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:24.358
I wouldn't call it a...
a-a <i>funny</i> comic strip.

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:27.561
It's sort of a, "Oh, I'm gonna
send that to my Aunt Mavis"

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:29.463
kind of a comic strip.

00:00:29.496 --> 00:00:32.699
It's an infuriatingly saccharin
little bubble of family values

00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:35.169
that's been a tumor
on our nation's funny pages

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:37.271
since the Eisenhower
Administration!

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:40.073
Just take a look
at this (bleep) drivel!

00:00:40.107 --> 00:00:43.577 line:0%
 
"What do birds do
if they are afraid of flying?"

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.878 line:0%
 
God...!

00:00:44.912 --> 00:00:46.513 line:0%
 
(laughter)

00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:50.884
-(whooping, applause)
-(exasperated grunt)

00:00:50.918 --> 00:00:52.853
Why was that published?!

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:56.523
This is (bleep), like,

00:00:56.557 --> 00:00:59.660
the monologue in Ted Cruz's head
most of the time.

00:00:59.693 --> 00:01:01.695
(laughter, whooping, applause)

00:01:04.598 --> 00:01:07.000
Thankfully, the Tumblr
Time is a Flat Circle

00:01:07.034 --> 00:01:09.169
has had some fun
with the captions.

00:01:09.203 --> 00:01:10.838 line:0%
 
Uh, "What happened to my head

00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:13.440 line:0%
 
is not something
that gets better."

00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:14.608 line:0%
 
(laughter)

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:16.210
-I feel it.
-Well, we wanted to...

00:01:16.243 --> 00:01:18.178
we wanted to get in
on the action as well,

00:01:18.212 --> 00:01:20.480
so, comedians, I'm gonna show
you a <i>Family Circus</i> cartoon

00:01:20.514 --> 00:01:22.449
that we've removed
the joke from--

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:25.085
and I mean loosely, "joke"--
and for 250 points,

00:01:25.118 --> 00:01:28.155
I want you to give me a new line
for this precious little moment.

00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:30.958
All right, first up,
this tender scene.

00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:33.160
What's going on there, Jesse?

00:01:33.193 --> 00:01:35.863
Uh, it's a rectal thermometer?

00:01:35.896 --> 00:01:37.865
Now you tell me!

00:01:37.898 --> 00:01:38.999
(laughter)

00:01:39.032 --> 00:01:42.302
-(whooping, applause)
-Yep.

00:01:42.336 --> 00:01:43.604
Ron.

00:01:43.637 --> 00:01:45.672
Uh, Mom, you can use
my vaporizer,

00:01:45.706 --> 00:01:47.741
but you got to use
your own weed.

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:49.743
-All right, points.
-(laughter, applause)

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:51.979
(cheering, whooping)

00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:57.251
Next up, this family outing.

00:01:57.284 --> 00:02:00.087
-Jesse. -Jesus Christ, Dad,
I think you killed that guy.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.256
You're not even
gonna go back and check?

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:05.025
-(laughter, whooping, applause)
-Points.

00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:06.627
Tom.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.763
(high-pitched): Is there gonna
be pizza at Mom's funeral?

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:11.365
(laughter)

00:02:11.398 --> 00:02:13.333
(applause)

00:02:16.203 --> 00:02:19.072
-Ron.
-Son, hand me my gun.

00:02:19.106 --> 00:02:21.808
Dilbert's cut us off
for the last time.

00:02:21.842 --> 00:02:25.012
-(laughter, applause, cheering)
-Points. Yep.

00:02:28.215 --> 00:02:31.251
Next up,
this adorable little exchange.

00:02:31.285 --> 00:02:32.753
Ron.

00:02:32.786 --> 00:02:35.889
Hey, look, lady, you pay
for the dick, not the height.

00:02:35.923 --> 00:02:37.424
(laughter, cheering)

00:02:37.457 --> 00:02:39.893
(applause, whooping)

00:02:39.927 --> 00:02:41.895
HARDWICK:
Yes.

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:44.831
(cheering, whistling)

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:54.942
We... It's unfortunate
we just can't hack the site

00:02:54.975 --> 00:02:57.477
and put things like that
on there.

00:02:57.511 --> 00:02:58.645
Tom.

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:00.347
That's not
a Fugazi T-shirt, bitch.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.583
Fugazi doesn't sell T-shirts.

00:03:02.616 --> 00:03:05.352
-(laughter, cheering, applause)
-MAN: Yeah!

00:03:07.154 --> 00:03:09.156
One guy got very excited
about that.

00:03:10.791 --> 00:03:12.659
-Next up...
-You and me, guy.

00:03:12.693 --> 00:03:14.862
...this imaginative scene.
This imaginative scene.

00:03:14.895 --> 00:03:16.330
Tom.

00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:19.499
I got my third callback
for <i>Goosebumps 2.</i>

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:22.236
Jesus, who do I got to blow
to be in <i>Goosebumps 2?</i>

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.071
All right, points.

00:03:24.104 --> 00:03:26.373
I think that would
probably be R.L. Stine.

00:03:26.406 --> 00:03:27.941
-I would imagine.
-Really?

00:03:27.975 --> 00:03:29.209
And pretty easily done.

00:03:29.243 --> 00:03:31.278
-Next up...
-Two phone calls.

00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:34.982
Next up... Two...
Why two phone calls?

00:03:35.015 --> 00:03:38.685
Is this the exchange?
Yes, get me R.L. Stine.

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:40.454
Hello, this is R.L. Stine.

00:03:40.487 --> 00:03:42.856
Why, hello there, I guess
this was one call, wasn't it?

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.992
Hello?

00:03:45.025 --> 00:03:45.092
You're up, I'm on my way over.
