00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.700
It’s very important that we have this department
now, at this current time

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.920
[Crowds chant, "I  Can't Breathe"]

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.590
because our nation needs the kinds of knowledge
that this department produces and will continue

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.380
to produce.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.240
Columbia has a longstanding tradition in
what we would call now African-American Studies

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.300
or Black Studies, you know, going back to
the days of Franz Boas but even in particular

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.250
after 1968

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.150
We see ourselves as a Harlem institution.
I mean African-American studies at Columbia

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:46.630
joins the Schomburg and Harlem Stage and the
Studio Museum and all of those like august

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:53.900
Harlem institutions of intellectuals from
the United States, the Caribbean, and Africa,

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.750
all of whom are committed to the very best
scholarly work.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.760
We now join them as a full-fledged department
at the University.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:12.350
I think it will be a hub for faculty, who
are working on a range of  topics and

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.220
disciplines, but I think it will also give
undergraduate students, Master’s level students,

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.850
and hopefully doctoral students also a hub
and a home for future studies.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.020
What attracted me to come here to Columbia
University was the robust programming that

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:33.760
was already in place. I was part of Manning
Marable’s class that interrogated Malcolm X's life

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.079
and his legacy, and I had the most
significant experience that has put me on

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.900
the pathway where I am now as a professor
in Africana Studies

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.920
One of the great things about, uh, being here  
at Columbia

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.840
is it’s really easy to get your students engaged in research.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.039
I think the prominence of the new department,
uh, and what makes maybe Columbia unique is

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:00.090
the fact that someone like me who’s an architect
is actually part of that department.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.289
Or you have someone from Journalism like Jelani
Cobb and June Cross who’ve been research

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:08.899
fellows but who can also be engaged in the
department. Or you have Kellie Jones who’s

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.440
an art historian involved And I – I think
that will make, uh, the new department actually

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.069
quite unique. For example, many of us are
interested in Black feminist perspectives,

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:24.209
like how do you make that a forefront in,
um, a mission statement and how you start

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.209
to craft curriculum.

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.980
Columbia is coming to this moment a bit later 
than other even peer institutions,

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.780
but I think that’s a good thing because it’s going
to allow us to kind of do things differently,

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.480
from a curricular standpoint, from an institutional
standpoint, than perhaps had been done before

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.090
at other Ivy institutions or at public institutions.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:47.430
So we’ve got a deep and extraordinary bench
of scholars, potential leaders of the department,

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.730
but you know, people who are very committed
to teaching and to producing very exciting,

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.500
um, innovative scholarship. It’s a wonderful
time to be at Columbia.
