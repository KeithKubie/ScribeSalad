00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.469
out
obviously when interacting with trans oh

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479
obviously when interacting with trans oh
 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.890

we feel disgust I feel very hungry right

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900

built within us to protect us from
 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:17.570
built within us to protect us from
potential dangers so if I if I were to

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580
potential dangers so if I if I were to
 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:28.400
potential dangers so if I if I were to
type this this spider is an example of

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410
type this this spider is an example of
 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.350
type this this spider is an example of
sensory disgust when you think of

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360
sensory disgust when you think of
 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.920
sensory disgust when you think of
insects or mice or all different sorts

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930
insects or mice or all different sorts
 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.240
insects or mice or all different sorts
of things that kind of grows too so it's

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250
of things that kind of grows too so it's
 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.979
of things that kind of grows too so it's
often because they could be carriers of

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989
often because they could be carriers of
 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.050
often because they could be carriers of
disease something like a cockroach isn't

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060
disease something like a cockroach isn't
 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.210
disease something like a cockroach isn't
necessarily dangerous for you but it

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220
necessarily dangerous for you but it
 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.740
necessarily dangerous for you but it
could indicate that your home or the

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750
could indicate that your home or the
 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:43.789
could indicate that your home or the
space you're living in is actually

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799
space you're living in is actually
 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.650
space you're living in is actually
unclean and so we've had this

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660
unclean and so we've had this
 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.000
unclean and so we've had this
evolutionary reaction to find they're

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010
evolutionary reaction to find they're
 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:55.340
evolutionary reaction to find they're
disgusting to protect our own cells if

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350
disgusting to protect our own cells if
 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.110
disgusting to protect our own cells if
you sneeze on yourself or if your best

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120
you sneeze on yourself or if your best
 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.129
you sneeze on yourself or if your best
friend's sneeze is on you it's not

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139
friend's sneeze is on you it's not
 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:02:59.870
friend's sneeze is on you it's not
nearly as bad as if a stranger sneezes

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880
nearly as bad as if a stranger sneezes
 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:00.979
nearly as bad as if a stranger sneezes
on you on the subway and it's kind of

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989
on you on the subway and it's kind of
 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:01.220
on you on the subway and it's kind of
like

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230
like
 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.259
like
I don't see tarantulas often yeah I have

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269
I don't see tarantulas often yeah I have
 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.809
I don't see tarantulas often yeah I have
no spirit I'm known exactly you don't

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819
no spirit I'm known exactly you don't
 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.610
no spirit I'm known exactly you don't
know this spider if we knew her

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620
know this spider if we knew her
 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.740
know this spider if we knew her
personally maybe be a little less scared

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750
personally maybe be a little less scared
 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:18.789
personally maybe be a little less scared
I'm so sorry Susan Sarandon Molly oh

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799
 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.000
that's disgusting

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010
that's disgusting
 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.710
that's disgusting
so we wanted to test some things that we

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720
so we wanted to test some things that we
 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.170
so we wanted to test some things that we
perceive as disgusting like a toilet and

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180
perceive as disgusting like a toilet and
 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.210
perceive as disgusting like a toilet and
a urinal and then put them side by side

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220
a urinal and then put them side by side
 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.680
a urinal and then put them side by side
with the things we use on a regular

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690
with the things we use on a regular
 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.050
with the things we use on a regular
basis like our phones and the keyboards

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060
basis like our phones and the keyboards
 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.240
basis like our phones and the keyboards
on our laptops to see which is actually

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250
on our laptops to see which is actually
 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.250
on our laptops to see which is actually
more disgusting we then took the swab

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260
more disgusting we then took the swab
 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.199
more disgusting we then took the swab
samples from each location to an agar

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209
samples from each location to an agar
 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.849
samples from each location to an agar
petri dish and let the cultures grow

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859
petri dish and let the cultures grow
 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:42.740
petri dish and let the cultures grow
then we left them in a warm right place

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750
then we left them in a warm right place
 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.530
then we left them in a warm right place
and here are the results so the cleanest

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540
and here are the results so the cleanest
 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.599
and here are the results so the cleanest
and least bacteria grown was in the

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609
and least bacteria grown was in the
 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.990
and least bacteria grown was in the
toilet which is everybody okay the

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000
toilet which is everybody okay the
 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.520
toilet which is everybody okay the
journal and the phone were about the

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530
journal and the phone were about the
 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.800
journal and the phone were about the
same and the most disgusting place was

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810
same and the most disgusting place was
 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.180
same and the most disgusting place was
the keyboard that's all kind of

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190
the keyboard that's all kind of
 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.039
the keyboard that's all kind of
surprising considering these two things

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049
surprising considering these two things
