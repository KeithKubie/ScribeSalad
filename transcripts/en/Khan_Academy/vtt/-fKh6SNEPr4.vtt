00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.824
- [Voiceover] So I have
the matrix A over here,

00:00:02.824 --> 00:00:05.407
and A has m rows and n columns,

00:00:07.736 --> 00:00:10.986
so we could call this an m by n matrix.

00:00:12.897 --> 00:00:15.256
And what I want to do in this video,

00:00:15.256 --> 00:00:19.423
is relate the linear independence,
or linear dependence,

00:00:20.497 --> 00:00:24.664
of the column vectors of
A, to the null space of A.

00:00:25.813 --> 00:00:26.646
So what, first of all

00:00:26.646 --> 00:00:28.850
what I am talking about as column vectors?

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.148
Well as you can see
there's n columns here,

00:00:31.148 --> 00:00:35.315
and we could view each of those
as an m-dimensional vector.

00:00:36.746 --> 00:00:38.600
And so, let me do it this way,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.706
so you can view this one right over here,

00:00:41.706 --> 00:00:44.123
we could write that as V one,

00:00:45.058 --> 00:00:45.891
V one,

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.623
this next one over here,
this would be V two,

00:00:50.623 --> 00:00:51.949
V two,

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.378
and you would have n of these,
because we have n columns,

00:00:54.378 --> 00:00:58.128
and so this one right
over here would be V n,

00:01:00.381 --> 00:01:01.214
V sub n.

00:01:03.148 --> 00:01:07.714
And so we could rewrite A, we
could rewrite the matrix A,

00:01:07.714 --> 00:01:09.381
the m by n matrix A,

00:01:10.339 --> 00:01:12.401
I'm bolding it to show
that that's a matrix,

00:01:12.401 --> 00:01:14.318
we could rewrite it as,

00:01:15.595 --> 00:01:19.067
so let me do it the same way, so,

00:01:19.067 --> 00:01:21.945
draw my little brackets there,

00:01:21.945 --> 00:01:23.947
we can write it, just express it,

00:01:23.947 --> 00:01:26.323
in terms of its column vectors,

00:01:26.323 --> 00:01:28.155
cos we could just say
well this is going to be

00:01:28.155 --> 00:01:29.988
V one for that column,

00:01:31.075 --> 00:01:32.908
V one for that column,

00:01:34.457 --> 00:01:37.374
V two for this column, all the way,

00:01:38.685 --> 00:01:39.980
we're gonna have n columns,

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.569
so you're gonna have V
n, for the nth column.

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:47.330
And remember, each of these,
are going to have m terms,

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.084
or I should say, m components in them.

00:01:50.084 --> 00:01:53.134
These are m-dimensional column vectors.

00:01:53.134 --> 00:01:54.476
Now what I want to do, I said I want to

00:01:54.476 --> 00:01:58.578
relate the linear
independence of these vectors,

00:01:58.578 --> 00:02:00.607
to the null space of A.

00:02:00.607 --> 00:02:04.530
So let's remind ourselves what
the null space of A even is.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.447
So the null space of A,

00:02:08.827 --> 00:02:10.494
the null space of A,

00:02:12.446 --> 00:02:17.027
is equal to, or I could
say it's equal to the set,

00:02:17.027 --> 00:02:19.527
it's the set of all vectors x,

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.230
that are members of R n,

00:02:24.943 --> 00:02:27.831
and I'm gonna double down
on why I'm saying R n,

00:02:27.831 --> 00:02:30.664
in a second, such that, such that,

00:02:32.291 --> 00:02:34.124
if I take my matrix A,

00:02:35.148 --> 00:02:37.356
if I take my matrix A,

00:02:37.356 --> 00:02:41.021
and multiply it by one of those x's,

00:02:41.021 --> 00:02:43.008
by one of those x's,

00:02:43.008 --> 00:02:47.175
I'm going to get, I'm going
to get the zero vector.

00:02:48.666 --> 00:02:52.930
So, why do the, why does x
have to be a member of R n?

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.045
Well just for the matrix
multiplication to work,

00:02:56.045 --> 00:03:00.748
for this to be, if this is m
by n, let me write this down,

00:03:00.748 --> 00:03:02.248
if this is m by n,

00:03:04.491 --> 00:03:06.801
well in order just to make
the matrix multiplication work

00:03:06.801 --> 00:03:09.509
or you could say the matrix
vector multiplication,

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:11.759
this has to be an n by one,

00:03:13.423 --> 00:03:15.090
an n by one, vector,

00:03:16.986 --> 00:03:18.695
and so it's gonna have n components,

00:03:18.695 --> 00:03:21.324
so it's gonna be a member of R n.

00:03:21.324 --> 00:03:24.560
If this was m by A, well, or,
let me use a different letter,

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.519
if this was m by, I don't know, seven,

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.743
then this would be R seven,
that we would be dealing with.

00:03:31.743 --> 00:03:34.360
So that is the null space.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.327
So, another way of thinking about it is,

00:03:36.327 --> 00:03:37.617
well if I take my matrix A,

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:40.144
and I multiply it by sum vector x,

00:03:40.144 --> 00:03:41.590
that's a member of this null space,

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.375
I'm going to get the zero vector.

00:03:43.375 --> 00:03:44.859
So if I take my matrix A,

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:47.428
which I've expressed here in
terms of its column vectors,

00:03:47.428 --> 00:03:49.761
multiply it by sum vector x,

00:03:51.116 --> 00:03:52.449
so sum vector x,

00:03:53.531 --> 00:03:57.389
and, actually let me make it clear that,

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:59.916
it doesn't have to have the same,

00:03:59.916 --> 00:04:02.916
so, sum vector x right over here,

00:04:04.114 --> 00:04:06.281
we draw the other bracket,

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:09.987
so this is the vector x, and so,

00:04:09.987 --> 00:04:12.954
it's going to have, it's a member of R n,

00:04:12.954 --> 00:04:14.255
so it's going to have n components,

00:04:14.255 --> 00:04:17.071
you're gonna have x one,
as the first component,

00:04:17.071 --> 00:04:20.154
x two, and go all the way, to x n.

00:04:22.424 --> 00:04:25.339
If you multiply, so if we say that this x

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:26.506
is a member of

00:04:28.657 --> 00:04:30.824
the null space of A, then,

00:04:32.266 --> 00:04:36.274
this whole thing is going to
be equal to the zero vector,

00:04:36.274 --> 00:04:38.269
is going to be equal to the zero vector,

00:04:38.269 --> 00:04:39.827
and once again the zero vector,

00:04:39.827 --> 00:04:42.858
this is gonna be an m by one vector,

00:04:42.858 --> 00:04:47.488
so it's gonna look, actually
let me write it like this,

00:04:47.488 --> 00:04:51.599
it's gonna have the same
number of rows as A,

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:54.019
so, I'll try to make it,

00:04:54.019 --> 00:04:57.436
the brackets roughly the same length, so,

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:02.992
and there we go, try and
draw my brackets neatly,

00:05:02.992 --> 00:05:05.993
so you're gonna have m of these, one, two,

00:05:05.993 --> 00:05:09.326
and then go all the way to the mth zero.

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.821
So, let's actually just multiply this out,

00:05:12.821 --> 00:05:16.042
using what we know of
matrix multiplication.

00:05:16.042 --> 00:05:18.029
And by the definition of
matrix multiplication,

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.924
one way to view this,

00:05:18.924 --> 00:05:21.415
if you were to multiply our matrix A

00:05:21.415 --> 00:05:23.525
times our vector x here,

00:05:23.525 --> 00:05:28.088
you're going to get the
first column vector, V one,

00:05:28.088 --> 00:05:28.921
V one,

00:05:29.758 --> 00:05:33.175
times the first component here, x one,

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.172
x one,

00:05:36.172 --> 00:05:39.674
plus, the second component
times the second column vector,

00:05:39.674 --> 00:05:41.174
x two times V two,

00:05:43.071 --> 00:05:43.904
V two,

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:47.577
and we're gonna do that n times,

00:05:47.577 --> 00:05:49.160
so plus dot dot dot

00:05:51.097 --> 00:05:52.930
x sub n times V sub n,

00:05:55.118 --> 00:05:55.951
V sub n,

00:05:58.631 --> 00:06:01.491
and these all when you add them together

00:06:01.491 --> 00:06:04.908
are going to be equal to the zero vector.

00:06:07.453 --> 00:06:09.504
Now this should be, this,

00:06:09.504 --> 00:06:11.771
so it's gonna be equal to the zero vector,

00:06:11.771 --> 00:06:14.057
and now this should start
ringing a bell to you,

00:06:14.057 --> 00:06:17.006
when we looked at, when we
looked at linear independence

00:06:17.006 --> 00:06:18.420
we saw something like this,

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:23.184
in fact we saw that these
vectors V, V sub one, V sub two,

00:06:23.184 --> 00:06:27.351
these n vectors, are linearly
independent if and only if,

00:06:29.413 --> 00:06:32.601
any linear, if and only
if the solution to this,

00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:35.576
or I guess you could say the
weights on these vectors,

00:06:35.576 --> 00:06:37.399
the only way to get this to be true

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:42.139
is if x one, x two, x
n are all equal zero.

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:43.792
So let me write this down.

00:06:43.792 --> 00:06:44.875
So V sub one,

00:06:47.119 --> 00:06:47.952
V sub two,

00:06:49.366 --> 00:06:51.283
all the way to V sub n,

00:06:52.796 --> 00:06:57.247
are linearly independent,
linearly independent,

00:06:57.247 --> 00:06:59.830
if and only if, if and only if,

00:07:01.215 --> 00:07:04.548
only solution, so let me, only solution,

00:07:07.775 --> 00:07:11.358
or you could say weights on
these vectors, to this equation,

00:07:11.358 --> 00:07:12.691
only solution is

00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:16.292
x one, x two,

00:07:18.105 --> 00:07:21.438
all the way to x n are equal to zero.

00:07:22.318 --> 00:07:23.707
So if the only solution here,

00:07:23.707 --> 00:07:26.333
if the only way to get this sum

00:07:26.333 --> 00:07:27.881
to be equal to the zero vector,

00:07:27.881 --> 00:07:30.733
is if x one, x two and x,
all the way through x n,

00:07:30.733 --> 00:07:31.814
are equal to zero,

00:07:31.814 --> 00:07:34.144
well that means that our
vectors V one, V two,

00:07:34.144 --> 00:07:37.226
all the way to V n, are
linearly independent,

00:07:37.226 --> 00:07:39.813
or vice versa, if they're
linearly independent,

00:07:39.813 --> 00:07:41.448
then the only solution to this,

00:07:41.448 --> 00:07:44.436
if we're solving for the
weights on those vectors,

00:07:44.436 --> 00:07:48.500
is if for x one, x two and
x n to be equal to zero.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.417
Remember, linear independence,
if you want to say,

00:07:51.417 --> 00:07:52.315
it's still mathematical,

00:07:52.315 --> 00:07:54.680
but a little bit more, common language is,

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.821
if these vectors are linearly independent,

00:07:56.821 --> 00:08:01.061
that means that none of these
vectors can be constructed

00:08:01.061 --> 00:08:05.504
by linear combinations
of the other vectors,

00:08:05.504 --> 00:08:07.620
or, looking at it this way,

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.532
this right over here is
a, you could view this

00:08:09.532 --> 00:08:12.768
as a linear combination
of all of the vectors,

00:08:12.768 --> 00:08:14.459
that the only way to get
this linear combination

00:08:14.459 --> 00:08:16.861
of all the vectors to be equal to zero,

00:08:16.861 --> 00:08:20.444
is if x one, x two,
all the way through x n

00:08:20.444 --> 00:08:21.531
are equal to zero,

00:08:21.531 --> 00:08:25.305
and we proved that in other
videos on linear independence.

00:08:25.305 --> 00:08:28.621
Well, if the only solution to this

00:08:28.621 --> 00:08:32.693
is all of the x one's through
x n's are equal to zero,

00:08:32.693 --> 00:08:34.682
that means that the null space,

00:08:34.682 --> 00:08:36.717
this is only going to
be true, you could say,

00:08:36.717 --> 00:08:39.717
if and only if, the null space of A,

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:43.478
the null space of A,

00:08:43.478 --> 00:08:46.396
let me make sure it looks like
a matrix, I'm gonna bold it,

00:08:46.396 --> 00:08:50.471
the null space of A only
contains one vector,

00:08:50.471 --> 00:08:53.270
it only contains the zero vector.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:56.025
Remember, this is, if all
of these are gonna be zero,

00:08:56.025 --> 00:08:57.500
well then the only solution here

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.644
is gonna be the zero vector,

00:08:59.644 --> 00:09:03.561
is going to be, is going
to be the zero vector.

00:09:04.554 --> 00:09:06.873
So the result that we're showing here is,

00:09:06.873 --> 00:09:11.040
if the column vectors of a
matrix are linearly independent,

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.806
then the null space of that matrix

00:09:15.806 --> 00:09:18.485
is only going to consist
of the zero vector.

00:09:18.485 --> 00:09:20.162
Or you could go the other way.

00:09:20.162 --> 00:09:24.631
If the null space of a matrix
only contains the zero vector,

00:09:24.631 --> 00:09:27.903
well that means that the
columns of that matrix

00:09:27.903 --> 00:09:29.986
are linearly independent.
