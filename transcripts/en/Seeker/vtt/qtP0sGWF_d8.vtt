00:00:00.057 --> 00:00:02.390
It turns out that when you
are wolfing down all that ice

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.470
cream, and your dog looks
at you like it's ashamed,

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.525
it's because it's ashamed.

00:00:07.525 --> 00:00:12.661
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:13.660
Anthony here, for DNews.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.450
And in the past, we've
thought that dogs

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.470
are pretty simplistic,
emotionally.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.400
While owners thought their
dogs saw them as best friends,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.740
science said it's more
like trustworthy guardian.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.450
Where owners saw
sympathy, science

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.880
said, emotional transference
and anthropomorphism.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.110
But a bunch of new
findings recently

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.439
show that dogs and a
lot of other animals

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.670
might have the same
emotional depth that we do.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.050
Gregory Berns is a
professor of neuroeconomics

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.090
at Emory University.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.490
And over the last
few years, he's

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.410
been training dogs to sit
comfortably in an MRI.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.530
Sit.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.340
Sit.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.640
Previously, putting an animal
in an MRI required sedation

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.500
or just dealing with a crazy,
stressed-out animal, which

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.440
means we've never gotten a
clear picture of how they think.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.940
We've been going mostly
on behavioral study.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.960
And let's be honest here, we
misread the behavior of humans

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.810
all the time.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.440
And we can verbally
communicate with humans.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.500
So--

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.520
Anyway, with calm, happy dogs
chilling in the brain tube,

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.900
they found some very
interesting activity going on,

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.860
particularly in an area
called the caudate nucleus.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.710
It's a happy place--
well, an anticipation

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:16.720
of happiness place.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.477
In humans, researchers can
look at the caudate nucleus,

00:01:19.477 --> 00:01:21.310
and based on what part
of it is lighting up,

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.596
predict what we
like, what our tastes

00:01:23.596 --> 00:01:24.970
are in things like
food or music.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.620
It can even clue
them in into things

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.840
that we find
aesthetically beautiful.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.130
In a dog, the caudate
lit up in response

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.790
to food or the
possibility of food.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.100
It activated at the
sense of familiar humans.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.544
It activated when their
owner walked into the room.

00:01:37.544 --> 00:01:38.960
So the same part
of the brain that

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.190
lights up for love and
attachment and beauty

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.720
in a human lit up for
similar things in a dog.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.190
Now that doesn't
necessarily mean

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.050
that a dog has got
a song that makes

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.740
them think of their
ex or anything,

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.320
but it's a functional homology.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.310
Their brains work
like ours, so they

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.960
might have emotions like ours.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.550
Other research lately
has been showing

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.600
a depth in emotion
and social memory

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.659
that we've never thought
animals were capable of.

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.450
We used to think that
friendship in animals

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.560
was based mostly on
reciprocity-- what

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.960
one animal can do for the
other to help it survive.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.169
A recent study of
chimpanzees actually

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:11.110
showed it's based on something
called the similarity effect.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.750
It's how we humans
choose friends.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.220
We tend to like people who have
personalities or interests that

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.890
are like ours.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.440
Chimps seem to do the same.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.510
Sociable, outgoing chimps
flock to one another.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.310
Emo chimps hung out under a
tree and smoked with other emo

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.330
chimps during lunch--
something like that.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.980
Anyway--

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.730
Another study of
dolphins this year

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.990
showed that they can
remember the unique whistle

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.870
of their friends, even after
being apart for decades.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.050
When a recording of
their buddy is played,

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.610
their mood improves, and
they go hunting around

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.610
in the tank to find
their lost friend.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.980
More and more, it is looking
like animals feel things

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.090
as deeply as we do.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.380
In his write-up of his
study in the New York Times,

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.710
Doctor Berns asks
how society would

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.960
have to change if
we can prove that.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.850
What happens to lab animals,
pet stores, agriculture?

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.870
Would we have to define
what an animal is to us?

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:00.710
What do you think?

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.240
Do animals have
emotions like us?

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.554
Dagger, do you have emotions?

00:03:05.554 --> 00:03:07.220
How did you feel at
the end of Twilight?

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.690
What is your five-year plan?

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.950
Feel free to answer any
of the questions I just

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.560
asked Dagger in the comments
and subscribe for more DNews.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.080
And oh, Dagger, we're going
to be on Petopia, over

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.770
on Animalist, aren't we?

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.960
They can't talk. they can
feel, but they can't talk.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.030
But he would say yes.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.170
You should go check that out.
