00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:10.428
Between you and the rest of the world 
lies an interface

00:00:10.428 --> 00:00:13.437
that makes up 16% of your physical weight.

00:00:13.437 --> 00:00:17.087
This is your skin, the largest organ 
in your body:

00:00:17.087 --> 00:00:22.468
laid out flat, it would cover close to 
1.7 square meters of ground.

00:00:22.468 --> 00:00:26.527
Its purpose may seem obvious—
to keep our insides in.

00:00:26.527 --> 00:00:28.317
But a look beyond the surface

00:00:28.317 --> 00:00:32.177
reveals that it plays a surprising 
number of roles in our lives.

00:00:32.177 --> 00:00:33.978
First, the basics.

00:00:33.978 --> 00:00:37.557
Skin is the foundation 
of the integumentary system,

00:00:37.557 --> 00:00:44.158
which also incorporates your hair, 
nails, and specialized glands and nerves.

00:00:44.158 --> 00:00:45.788
Made up of three layers,

00:00:45.788 --> 00:00:46.948
the epidermis,

00:00:46.948 --> 00:00:47.997
dermis,

00:00:47.997 --> 00:00:49.229
and hypodermis,

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:53.738
skin’s thickness varies 
from 0.5 millimeters at its thinnest

00:00:53.738 --> 00:00:57.019
and up to four millimeters 
at its thickest.

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:59.789
It also carries out three key functions:

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:00.746
protecting,

00:01:00.746 --> 00:01:01.714
regulating,

00:01:01.714 --> 00:01:04.768
and sensing the world beyond its limits.

00:01:04.768 --> 00:01:09.579
On a daily basis, its huge surface 
processes hundreds, if not thousands,

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:11.747
of physical sensations,

00:01:11.747 --> 00:01:15.746
relying mostly on large, 
pressure-sensitive skin components

00:01:15.746 --> 00:01:17.959
called Merkel cells.

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:19.631
In your fingertips alone,

00:01:19.631 --> 00:01:24.599
there are 750 Merkel cells 
per each square-centimeter of skin,

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:29.709
coupled with over 2,500 receptors
that give you your sense of touch.

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:34.038
This surface is also the body’s first 
major line of defense.

00:01:34.038 --> 00:01:38.349
Without it, you’d be a soggy mass 
of tissue and fluids,

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:41.059
fatally exposed to the elements.

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:44.341
Skin effectively seals off your insides

00:01:44.341 --> 00:01:47.036
and also absorbs pressure and shock

00:01:47.036 --> 00:01:51.120
with flexible collagen 
that makes up most of its dermal layer.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.791
The epidermis is made up mainly 
of skin cells called keratinocytes

00:01:55.791 --> 00:01:58.812
that are completely replaced 
every four weeks.

00:01:58.812 --> 00:02:04.071
As new cells form at the base of the
epidermis, older ones are pushed up.

00:02:04.071 --> 00:02:06.322
When these cells move upwards,

00:02:06.322 --> 00:02:09.991
they’re filled with a hardened protein 
called keratin.

00:02:09.991 --> 00:02:11.511
Once they reach the surface,

00:02:11.511 --> 00:02:15.261
they form a tightly-overlapping, 
waterproof layer

00:02:15.261 --> 00:02:18.772
that’s difficult for invading 
microbes to breach.

00:02:18.772 --> 00:02:21.864
Any harmful microbes that make it 
into the epidermis

00:02:21.864 --> 00:02:24.332
will encounter Langerhans cells.

00:02:24.332 --> 00:02:28.136
This group of protective skin cells 
detects invaders

00:02:28.136 --> 00:02:32.785
and communicates their presence 
to resident immune system T-cells,

00:02:32.785 --> 00:02:36.172
which react by launching 
an immune response.

00:02:36.172 --> 00:02:38.838
A crucial feature of this immune defense

00:02:38.838 --> 00:02:42.335
is the several thousand 
species of microorganisms

00:02:42.335 --> 00:02:43.695
that inhabit the planes,

00:02:43.695 --> 00:02:44.694
folds,

00:02:44.694 --> 00:02:47.085
and crevices of your skin.

00:02:47.085 --> 00:02:50.023
These microbes, 
which include bacteria and fungi,

00:02:50.023 --> 00:02:51.575
thrive in the sebum,

00:02:51.575 --> 00:02:54.975
an oily substance that’s secreted 
onto the skin’s surface

00:02:54.975 --> 00:02:58.595
by sebaceous glands nestled
inside the dermis.

00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:03.596
These skin microbes keep the immune system
in a state of constant surveillance,

00:03:03.596 --> 00:03:08.647
ensuring that it’s ready to react 
if the body really is at risk.

00:03:08.647 --> 00:03:10.297
Beyond this protective role,

00:03:10.297 --> 00:03:15.206
your skin is also a sensory organ that
helps regulate your body’s temperature,

00:03:15.206 --> 00:03:17.916
two roles that are closely interlinked.

00:03:17.916 --> 00:03:21.266
Nerves detect whether your skin 
is warm or cold

00:03:21.266 --> 00:03:24.126
and communicate that
information to your brain.

00:03:24.126 --> 00:03:27.327
In return, the brain instructs
localized blood vessels

00:03:27.327 --> 00:03:29.947
to either expand if the body is too warm,

00:03:29.947 --> 00:03:32.426
releasing heat from 
the blood through the skin,

00:03:32.426 --> 00:03:36.937
or to constrict if the body is cold,
which retains heat.

00:03:36.937 --> 00:03:42.327
At any given time, up to 25% of the body's
blood is circulating through the dermis,

00:03:42.327 --> 00:03:45.267
making this process extremely efficient.

00:03:45.267 --> 00:03:46.638
Under warm conditions,

00:03:46.638 --> 00:03:51.257
the skin’s sweat glands will secrete sweat
via ducts onto the surface,

00:03:51.257 --> 00:03:53.449
transferring heat out of the body.

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:58.318
Hair can also be stimulated
to conserve or release body warmth.

00:03:58.318 --> 00:04:01.440
The average human 
has 5 million hair follicles

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.496
embedded everywhere on the body

00:04:03.496 --> 00:04:06.705
except the palms of your hands 
and soles of your feet.

00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:10.285
Ninety to 150,000 of those 
are on your scalp,

00:04:10.285 --> 00:04:13.506
where they help shield
the large surface area of your head

00:04:13.506 --> 00:04:16.426
from physical damage and sunburn.

00:04:16.426 --> 00:04:19.788
When you're cold, tiny muscles 
called arrector pilli

00:04:19.788 --> 00:04:23.376
cause hair to stand upright
across the body.

00:04:23.376 --> 00:04:29.017
That’s the phenomenon known as goosebumps
and it traps body heat close to your skin.

00:04:29.017 --> 00:04:31.648
Skin’s vast surface isn’t just a shield;

00:04:31.648 --> 00:04:35.416
it also enables us to interact 
and connect with the world.

00:04:35.416 --> 00:04:39.297
Its multifunctional layer cools us down
and keeps us warm.

00:04:39.297 --> 00:04:42.270
The integumentary system 
may be many things,

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.737
but it’s certainly more than skin deep.
