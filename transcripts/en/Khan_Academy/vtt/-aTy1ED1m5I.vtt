00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:06.885
Graph the inequality y minus
4x is less than negative 3.

00:00:06.885 --> 00:00:08.260
So the first thing
we could do is

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.990
we could kind of put
this in mx plus b form,

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.950
or slope-intercept form,
but as an inequality.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.420
So we're starting with y minus
4x is less than negative 3.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.650
We can add 4x to both
sides of this inequality.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.670
So let's add 4x to both
sides of this inequality,

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.030
and then we'll just have
a y on the left-hand side.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.040
These guys cancel out.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.410
So you have y is
less than 4x minus 3.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.890
We could have had
negative 3 plus 4x,

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.320
but we want to write the 4x
first just because that's

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.490
a form that we're
more familiar with.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.620
So it's less than 4x minus 3.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.160
And now we can
attempt to graph it.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.210
But before I graph it, I want
to be a little bit careful here.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.610
So let me draw our axes.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.790
So this is the x-axis,
and is that is the y-axis.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.740
And we want to be
careful, because this

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.540
says y is less than 4x
minus 3, not less than

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.220
or equal to 4x minus 3, or
not y is equal to 4x minus 3.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.760
So what we want to do is kind
of create a boundary at y

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.110
is equal to 4x minus 3, and
the solution to this inequality

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.110
will be all of the area below
that, all of the y values

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.640
less than that.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.650
So let's try to do it.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.140
So the boundary line would look
like-- so let me write it over

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:39.470
here-- so we have a boundary
at y is equal to 4x minus 3.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.120
Notice this isn't
part of the solution.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.369
This isn't less than or equal.

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:43.580
It's just less than.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.990
But this will at
least help us draw,

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.405
essentially, the boundary.

00:01:47.405 --> 00:01:48.530
So we could do it two ways.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.240
If you know slope
and y-intercept,

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.110
you know that 4 is our
slope and that negative 3

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.400
is our y-intercept.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.150
Or you can literally
just take two points,

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.490
and that'll help you
define a line here.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:05.280
So you could say, well, when
x is equal to 0, what is y?

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.340
You get 4 times 0 minus 3, you
get y is equal to negative 3.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.710
And we knew that because
it was the y-intercept.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:16.080
So you have 0, and then you
have 1, 2, 0, and negative 3.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.740
And then you have
the point, let's say,

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.490
when x is equal
to-- I don't know--

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.920
let's say when x is equal to 2.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.800
When x is equal to 2, what is y?

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.150
We have 4 times
2 is 8 minus 3, y

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.540
is then going to be equal to 5.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.350
So then you go 1, 2, and
you go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.630
And so you have that
point there as well.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.676
And then we can just
connect the dots.

00:02:45.676 --> 00:02:47.550
Or you could say, look,
there's a slope of 4.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.230
So every time we move
over 1, every time we

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.020
move 1 in the x direction, we
move up 4 in the y direction.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.270
So we could draw it like that.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.504
So the line will look
something like this.

00:02:58.504 --> 00:03:00.420
And I'm just going to
draw it in a dotted line

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.027
because, remember, this
isn't part of the solution.

00:03:05.027 --> 00:03:06.860
Actually, let me draw
it a little bit neater

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.130
because that point should
be right about there,

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.740
and this point should
be right about there.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.770
And then this boundary line I'm
going to draw as a dotted line.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.875
So it's going to look
something like that.

00:03:19.875 --> 00:03:21.750
I draw it a dotted line
to show that it's not

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.080
part of the solution.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.610
Our solution has the
y's less than that.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:31.140
So for any x, so you pick an x
here, if you took 4x minus 3,

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.871
you're going to
end up on the line.

00:03:32.871 --> 00:03:35.120
But we don't want the y's
that are equal to that line.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.830
We want for that
particular x, the y's

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.480
that are less than the line.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.780
So it's going to be all
of this area over here.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.010
We're less than the line, and
we're not including the line,

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.960
and that's why I put
a dotted line here.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.880
You can also try values out.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.460
You can say, well, this line
is dividing our coordinate axes

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.550
into, essentially,
the region above it

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.890
and the region below it,
and you can test it out.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.431
Let's take something
that's above it.

00:03:57.431 --> 00:04:02.250
Let's take the
point 0, 0 and see

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.650
if that satisfies
our inequality.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.110
If we have y is 0 is
less than 0 minus 3,

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.540
or we get 0 is less
than negative 3.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.490
This is definitely not the case.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:16.510
This is not true.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.370
And it makes sense
because that 0, 0 is not

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.040
part of the solution.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.440
Now, we could go on the other
side of our boundary line.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.190
And we could take the
point, I don't know,

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.805
let's take the point 3 comma 0.

00:04:31.805 --> 00:04:34.180
So let's say that this is the
point-- well, that's right.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.330
There's a point 2 comma 0.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.170
Let's take the point 3
comma 0 right over here.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.490
This should work because
it's in the region less than.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.760
But let's verify
it for ourselves.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.490
So we have y is 0.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.576
0 is less than 4
times 3 minus 3.

00:04:51.576 --> 00:04:54.865
0 is less than 12 minus 3.

00:04:54.865 --> 00:04:58.190
0 Is less than 9, which
is definitely true.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.100
So that point does
satisfy the inequality.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.090
So in general, you
want to kind of look

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.150
at this as an equal to
draw the boundary line.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.791
We did it.

00:05:05.791 --> 00:05:07.540
But we drew it as a
dotted line because we

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.780
don't want to include
it because this

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:09.946
isn't less than or equal to.

00:05:09.946 --> 00:05:11.240
It's just less than.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.040
And then our solution
to the inequality

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.270
will be the region
below it, all the y's

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.191
less than the line
for x minus 3.
