00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.470
PROFESSOR: Welcome back.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.500
Today, we will
consider solutions

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.355
to systems of an infinite
number of degrees of freedom.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.960
What we'll consider is when
you have identical oscillators,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.600
which are coupled
only to the neighbors,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.200
and there is an
infinite number of them.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:53.240
So each one is an infinitely
small oscillator, as I say,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.420
coupled to each neighbor.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.410
The simplest example is
that of a taut string.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.220
Each piece of that string
is a harmonic oscillator.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.130
It oscillates transversely.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.990
And each piece is identical
to every other piece.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.500
And it's coupled
to its neighbors.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.562
So let's consider the
following problem.

00:01:18.562 --> 00:01:20.770
The problem we are going to
talk about-- the solution

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.410
of the following problem.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.830
Suppose you have a string.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.710
For practical purposes,
an infinite string.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:37.970
It has a mass per unit length
of new mu, a constant tension T,

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:45.530
and at one end it's
connected to a massless ring.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.380
This is an idealized situation.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.705
You could imagine, suppose
that ring was on your finger.

00:01:51.705 --> 00:01:57.370
You held the string taut
and you moved your finger

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.770
in some ways, which
caused a distortion, which

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.680
propagated down this string.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:12.320
You got a progressive pulse
going down this string.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.980
So this is an idealized
diagram of that situation.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.300
I've indicated the finger
holding the string by,

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.770
you could imagine,
a massless ring

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.050
sliding on a frictionless
rod, for example.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.680
And somehow or other, a force
is applied to this ring.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.279
But you can think of
the actual problem

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:34.195
where you're holding the
ring with your finger

00:02:34.195 --> 00:02:36.360
and moving this up and down.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.800
Now, somehow or other,
you're moving this ring such

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:50.230
that as a result of your motion,
there is a progressive pulse.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.220
And the idealized
pulse we'll consider

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.170
is a triangular shape
like this, where

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.880
this height is H and
the length from here

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.643
and here is L. It is idealized.

00:03:01.643 --> 00:03:07.610
In reality, you can't have
sharp corners like that.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.705
You can imagine there
is a very tiny curvature

00:03:11.705 --> 00:03:14.200
at those locations.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.480
Now, what we are told is
that at some instant t given

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:27.040
by 4L over-- and this is the
phase velocity of propagation

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.470
down the pulse over
square root of t over mu.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.440
At this instant of time,
you look at the string

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.200
and you see that this is
the shape of that pulse.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.880
And as a function of time,
that propagates to the right.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.360
OK?

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.290
The question is,
what is the motion

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.560
of this ring as a
function of time?

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.170
That's one.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:08.490
Two, what is the power that the
force which drives this string

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.400
delivers to the string?

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.630
So what's the power
as a function of time?

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.019
All right, next.

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.610
What is at any instant of
time the potential energy

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.055
stored in this pulse?

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.470
Four, what is the kinetic
energy stored in this pulse

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.230
as it's propagating?

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.760
And finally the question,
are your results

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:50.050
to the power that's delivered,
the potential energy

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.960
stored in the distortion,
the kinetic energy

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.180
in the distortion
consistent with each other?

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.965
These are the things
we are told to assume.

00:05:02.965 --> 00:05:04.600
And I repeat some of them.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.990
We assume the ring is massless.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.290
The distortion is always
sufficiently small

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.900
so that this height is
much smaller than this.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.560
So that this angle here
is sufficiently small

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:27.190
that we can approximate
the sine angle the angle

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.800
or the tangent of the
angle, which of course

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.020
is this height divided by that.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.450
So it's h over L over T.

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.760
We are told that the mass
per unit length is mu

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.010
and that the tension is uniform.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.980
In other words, because
this distortion is small,

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:51.220
we are making the assumption
that the tension in this string

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:58.340
is constant and the
same everywhere.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.260
There are no losses,
no frictional losses.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:06.010
And finally, all the
motion is-- because this

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.255
is so small, is in the
transverse direction.

00:06:08.255 --> 00:06:14.630
So any piece of the string moves
in the transverse direction.

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.620
This is a reasonable
approximation to reality.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.730
Or put it the other
way around, the reality

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.920
would be a reasonable
approximation

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.420
to this idealized
situation, which

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.890
we will try to
understand and solve.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:37.390
OK, so how do we go about it?

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:38.710
The usual way.

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:44.730
We first have to
represent the problem

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:47.840
in terms of mathematics.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.180
So what do we know?

00:06:50.180 --> 00:07:07.150
The system is a continuous
infinite row of oscillators.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:11.250
Each one connected
only to its neighbor.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:18.170
And we know that
such a system can

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:22.760
be represented by
a wave equation.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:29.110
The equation of motion for
this system is a wave equation.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:34.940
In essence, if you remember
when we had coupled oscillators,

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.940
three oscillators,
four, et cetera.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.550
Every time you add
one more oscillator,

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:45.470
you have one more
equation of motion.

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:50.670
So if you have an infinite
number of oscillators,

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.740
you expect to have
an infinite number

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.710
of coupled equations of motions.

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:00.910
That's what a wave equation is.

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:08.890
For every position x, you
have an equation of motion.

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:12.300
Why the distortion
is a function of x?

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:17.190
So essentially for every value
of x, you have one equation.

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:20.810
Since x is a continuum,
this, in essence,

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:24.650
is an infinite number of
coupled differential equations.

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:28.070
And we call this
the wave equation.

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:33.990
So the equation of motion
of the string is that.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:36.049
What else do we know?

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:39.860
How can we use
the laws of nature

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:41.950
to describe this situation?

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:43.200
Well, let's consider the ring.

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:51.470
On the ring, there
will be forces.

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:54.675
One is the string is
attached, so there

00:08:54.675 --> 00:09:00.300
will be the tension in the
string pulling on the ring.

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:05.150
We said that the ring cannot--
it moves only up and down,

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:10.520
so there must be some
constraining force on it.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.520
If you're imagining it to
be on this frictionless rod,

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:18.240
then that constraining
force is the reaction

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.990
of the rod on the ring.

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:24.520
If you're thinking of it in
terms of a finger holding

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:28.870
onto that ring,
then your finger is

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:32.170
preventing the ring moving
backwards or forwards.

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:34.760
So that's this reaction force.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:39.600
Now, on top of that, there
is the vertical force,

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.080
the one we are
interested in, which

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:47.140
must be the cause
of the distortion.

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:51.830
So those are the three forces.

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:54.550
What else do we know?

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:58.390
We said that we are going
to idealize this situation.

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:02.140
We're going to assume that
this ring has no mass.

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.180
It's only there so
you can essentially

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:06.730
hold the tip of the string.

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:11.070
Now if mass is 0, then in
Newton's laws of motion

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:14.590
there can be no net
force on that mass.

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:18.710
Because if you applied
any force to a 0 mass,

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:20.440
it will have an
infinite acceleration.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.720
Your ring would disappear.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:28.900
So the fact that the ring is
massless-- in other words,

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:32.760
you're just holding the
very tip of the string.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.180
That's what it,
in essence, means.

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:39.110
It means there is no
net force on the ring.

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:42.000
The ring does not move
backwards and forwards.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.315
There's no net force
in that direction.

00:10:49.760 --> 00:11:04.340
So the reaction of
the rod on the string

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:08.470
must be exactly equal to
the horizontal component

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:11.980
of the tension.

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:17.610
Actually, we don't need this
for the solving of the problem.

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:20.030
On the other hand, in
the vertical direction

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:24.800
we also know that there is
no net force vertically.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:30.796
And so the magnitude of the
force at any instant of time

00:11:30.796 --> 00:11:34.240
will, of course, be
equal and opposite

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:39.660
to the magnitude of the
force due to the tension

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:44.620
in this string, the component of
that in the vertical direction.

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:49.930
So the F of t at
any instant of time

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:54.970
will be equal to minus
the vertical component

00:11:54.970 --> 00:12:00.680
of the tension on the string.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:04.330
OK, so that's everything
we know about the dynamics.

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:15.720
This plus the knowledge
that at the time

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.180
we were given this was the
shape of the distortion,

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.370
and it was progressing
to the right,

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:26.590
must be enough to
be able to predict

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:30.250
the motion of the ring,
the power delivered.

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:35.980
Now, why do I say that?

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:37.890
Well, let's go
back for a second.

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:40.050
This will tell us
what the ring is doing

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:42.690
and what the forces
are acting on it.

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:47.070
Now, if you have a force
acting on something,

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:51.050
and that something
is moving, the power

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:56.030
that you will deliver
that to that object

00:12:56.030 --> 00:13:00.700
is the dot product
between the force

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:04.330
and the velocity of the object.

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:10.380
These we know because power
is work per unit time.

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:18.690
Work done by a force is force
times the distance moved.

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:23.500
So therefore, work times
distance moved per second

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:30.250
is the force times the velocity.

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:37.410
So this is the power
generated by a force

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:43.600
if it moves an object
with a velocity v of t.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.550
From what I told
you earlier, I'm

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:50.600
just thinking through whether
we can solve this problem.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.860
From the part I
discussed earlier,

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:55.460
we will be able to
figure out the force.

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:58.620
We will be able to
figure out the motion.

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:02.440
Therefore, we will be able
to calculate this and answer

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.900
the second part of the problem.

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:08.030
Let's continue.

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:11.210
We want to find
the energy stored

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:14.280
in the distortion of this ring.

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.220
How would we do
that to make sure

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:18.030
that we have
everything in place?

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:20.960
Well, if you have
some system which

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:26.930
you distort from equilibrium,
the potential energy

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:29.450
stored by conservation
of energy is

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:38.430
equal to the work you do
to distort that system.

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:46.500
In our case, the pulse
is a distorted string

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.170
from equilibrium.

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:51.780
So if I calculate
the work that I

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:56.740
will have to do to produce
that shape of the string,

00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:00.710
that will be equal to the
potential energy stored

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:03.010
in the string.

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:04.890
So potential energy,
in other words,

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:07.090
is work to distort the string.

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:13.870
And that is simply the integral
of the force times the distance

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:17.285
that will move that force
to distort the string.

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:26.000
So that we will be
able to do since we--

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.070
as I'll show in a second.

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:33.100
The next part was, what is the
kinetic energy in the pulse?

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:36.620
Well kinetic energy
is, of course,

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:42.385
1/2 mass times velocity
squared of a system.

00:15:42.385 --> 00:15:47.350
The string is-- it's a
continuous distribution

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:48.980
of masses.

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:53.910
If I take every
piece of that string

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:58.050
and calculate its
transverse velocity--

00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:00.080
that's the only
velocity that it has.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.440
We said that this string
has only transverse motion.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.840
So if I calculate the
transverse velocity

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:13.630
of every piece of the string
and add up all the pieces,

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:16.540
I'll have the total
kinetic energy stored.

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:19.440
So at any instant
of time, I have

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:23.090
to just find out what every
piece of the string is doing,

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:26.640
calculate its velocity
squared multiplied

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:33.300
by 1/2 by the mass of that
piece, add them all up,

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:34.785
and that's equal
to-- therefore, we

00:16:34.785 --> 00:16:39.060
will have to integrate across
the whole string 1/2 times

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:43.470
the transverse
velocity squared times

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:48.010
the density of
the-- the string has

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:51.580
certain mass per
unit length, mu.

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:56.670
So I have to take this and
integrate a mu dx times that.

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:59.330
That'll give us the
total kinetic energy.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:01.160
OK.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:07.810
So now, here we have the
problem in terms of mathematics.

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:11.097
And we'll switch over
and try to solve it.

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:17.750
OK.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:32.540
This wave equation
has, as I told you,

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:37.240
is equivalent to an infinite
coupled differential equations.

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:42.340
It has infinite
number of solutions.

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:45.650
Trying like we did
for simpler system,

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:48.150
like system with one
degree of freedom

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:51.510
or two degree of freedom
is no longer practical.

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:53.990
I can't go through
all the possibilities

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:56.670
and then guess
which one applies.

00:17:56.670 --> 00:18:00.870
So I have to use some more
knowledge or experience.

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:08.600
In general, as I say, there's
an infinite number of solutions.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:16.420
But we know that we are looking
for a very specific kind

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:18.120
of solution.

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:25.370
We know that this
pulse we're told

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:30.140
was generated by this
mass-- this ring.

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:31.230
Sorry, not the mass.

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:35.480
By this ring being
moved by a finger.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:39.850
Which gave rise to
a progressive wave.

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:46.460
Meaning a shape like this
which is moving to the right.

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:50.240
That immediately
gives us a clue.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:55.160
We know that there are some
general classes of solutions

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.430
of this wave equation.

00:18:57.430 --> 00:19:00.540
There are the
normal modes, which

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:08.650
are every piece of this string
moving with the same frequency

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:11.120
and phase, et cetera.

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.800
There is another one
which isn't obvious,

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:18.830
but which Professor Walter
Lewin discussed in class,

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:22.200
that is actually quite-- I
consider it the miraculous one.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.450
It's so not obvious.

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:29.140
There is a solution
of this wave equation,

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:32.640
which consists of
any distortion.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.780
You can take any shape.

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:42.150
And if somehow or other you
manage to make that distortion

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:49.280
move with a uniform
velocity corresponding

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:58.020
to this velocity in
the wave equation--

00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:04.400
so for our string, the square
root of this number-- that

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:08.640
will progress forever.

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:12.400
It's a progressive
wave solution.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.960
And it's for any shape.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:21.870
So here, clearly we are
talking of that kind

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:25.940
of a solution of
this wave equation.

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:29.460
And as I say, from what you've
learned from Professor Walter

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:33.680
Lewin, we know that
the wave equation

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:35.940
does have that
class of solutions.

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:45.690
So the solution to
this problem must

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:48.830
be that of a progressive wave.

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:54.490
Specifically, a
shape like this which

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:59.180
moves to the right with a
velocity square root of T

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:00.580
over mu.

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:08.390
And I cannot resist emphasizing
that no part of the string is

00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:12.240
moving here to the right.

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:16.870
The string is only moving
in the transverse direction.

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:21.710
But it is the distortion which
is moving with that velocity v

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:22.210
.

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:23.501
It's called the phase velocity.

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:27.690
All right.

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:32.100
So our knowledge
of the solutions

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:39.080
of wave equations and these
descriptions make sense.

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:43.220
And so we know the class of
solutions that describe this.

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:48.950
In fact, it is the progressive
wave solution of this problem.

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:50.140
Fantastic.

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:59.550
So we know what this string is
doing at all times, a earlier

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:03.250
times and later times.

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:08.160
From now on, this triangle will
just move forever like that.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.940
That will be the distortion.

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:14.080
I can turn the clock around.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:18.950
I know that earlier it
was here, here, et cetera.

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:25.490
So I know the shape of
this string at all times.

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:32.140
Knowing that, I can-- it's
a funny way of saying it,

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.090
predict because it
happened earlier.

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:40.720
But I can tell you
what the distortion

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.730
must have been at earlier times.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:54.880
Going back with velocity
v until-- up to the times

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:58.530
when this distortion was here.

00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:03.580
Of course, the string
was doing nothing.

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:09.380
But at some instant of-- so the
total picture is the following.

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:12.600
We start off with
the taut string.

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:16.600
At some instant of
time, the person

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:21.290
must have moved the string
with uniform velocity

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:26.610
up, which I call the transverse
velocity the transverse.

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:33.260
That'll start this wave front.

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:40.210
You will have come to a stop and
start moving downwards again,

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:46.350
formed this triangle,
and then I do no more.

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:50.640
This triangle will
then progress forward.

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:56.190
It will progress with
a phase velocity v

00:23:56.190 --> 00:24:01.050
with this velocity,
which we know.

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:04.100
It's not something
I did in my head.

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:12.650
I can derive this
by studying how

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:21.520
a string can be described
by the wave equation.

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.460
But for this
instant, you can say

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:26.200
I took it from a
book or somewhere,

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:28.740
or from the lectures of
Professor Walter Lewin.

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:32.860
The phase velocity of
a pulse on this string

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:37.270
is-- of an ideal string is
the square root of the tension

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:40.940
divided in mass per unit length.

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:43.320
OK.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:50.450
And I was telling you a second
ago, when I go back in time

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:56.460
at any instant of time
when they ring was moving,

00:24:56.460 --> 00:25:02.400
this string has that shape.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:12.760
And as I move the ring up
and generate this wave front,

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:16.610
every piece of the
string is moving up

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:21.720
with a transverse velocity
v tr, which I don't know.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:28.660
But the result is that
this part of the pulse

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:33.330
moves to the right with
velocity [INAUDIBLE],

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:37.330
phase velocity of the pulse.

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:39.880
Don't get confused.

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.430
This piece of the
string-- and I'm

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:45.640
repeating myself-- is
not moving to the right.

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:50.280
This piece is moving up with
this transverse velocity.

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:53.900
This piece of the
string is moving up.

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:57.050
This piece isn't moving yet.

00:25:57.050 --> 00:26:01.080
But shortly afterwards, it will.

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:04.820
And so the result
of the movement

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:09.510
of every piece of
this string up is

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:15.940
to produce a pulse which
is moving to the right.

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:17.770
OK.

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:23.590
So now we want to calculate what
is this transverse velocity.

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:29.720
Well, from this picture
it will be-- this velocity

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.700
is related to that
one by that angle.

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:38.550
And so the motion of the ring
is the transverse velocity

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:42.680
at time t of the
ring-- this part of it.

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:44.730
OK, we're talking
about this-- is

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:50.370
equal to v times
H over L over 2.

00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:52.050
That's the tangent
of this angle.

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:54.460
That's the relation
between this velocity

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:59.110
and this transverse velocity.

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:02.400
Which is equal to 2v H over L.

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:17.330
And this is the motion of this
string from the time when this

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:25.560
is back here until the time
when this is moved for the ring

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:32.700
to be at the maximum height
H. If we remember that we were

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:36.240
told that the shape
of the pulse-- and I

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:40.470
have to refer you now back
to do original picture.

00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:43.950
If you look at that
original picture,

00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:49.020
we were told that at time
4L over the square root of T

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:54.480
over mu, that pulse was--
well, the back end of it

00:27:54.480 --> 00:28:01.270
was 2L away from the ring
and the forward part was 3L.

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:06.610
That pulse is moving
with velocity v.

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:10.290
And therefore, we can
calculate the time

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:13.550
when the different
parts of that pulse

00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:17.090
were generated by the ring.

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:27.230
From the time L over v until 3L
over 2v, this part of the pulse

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:29.520
was generated.

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:35.230
And so the transverse velocity
during that period of the ring

00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:40.450
is 2v H over L.

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:43.570
Later on, now the
ring is at the top

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:47.910
and just the front edge of
the pulse has been generated.

00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:54.040
We now suddenly-- this is
an idealized situation.

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:58.660
So this ring was going
up with uniform velocity.

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:01.240
And it suddenly
reverses direction.

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.320
Obviously, that's not
the physical situation.

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:05.420
That's infinite acceleration.

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:10.250
But we can imagine it
happens very fast that it's

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:13.810
almost infinite acceleration.

00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:17.800
And so suddenly, we
change from the ring,

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:23.870
pulling the string upwards to
the ring pulling the string

00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:25.120
downwards.

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:30.490
We are now creating the
back edge of that pulse.

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:35.820
The situation is symmetric
to the previous case.

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:41.030
The only difference is that
it's in the opposite direction.

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:43.670
And we know that the
magnitude of the two

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:47.060
are the same because
the pulse is symmetric.

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:51.450
In one case, we are
producing a wave front

00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:53.360
which is at some
angle like that.

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:56.350
And then the other like this.

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:58.440
But they're symmetric.

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:05.140
The angles are the same, but
in the opposite direction.

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:08.160
So the transverse
velocity here now

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:12.200
is therefore minus
2v H over L. And this

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:14.680
happens this time interval.

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:26.270
By the time we've
reached time 2L over V,

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:35.080
the complete pulse
has left the ring.

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:39.960
From then on, the ring
must be stationary.

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:42.735
Because if it moved, it
would produce new distortions

00:30:42.735 --> 00:30:45.170
in the string.

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:57.030
OK, so we have
completely described

00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:58.280
the motion of the ring.

00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:01.270
That was the first
part of the problem.

00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:06.320
And I repeat quickly, you have
a string which is straight.

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.870
I'm holding the ring.

00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:09.990
I'm waiting, waiting.

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:12.240
At some time when
I feel like it,

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:18.716
I start moving it with
uniform velocity up.

00:31:18.716 --> 00:31:23.610
I then reverse instantaneously
and move with uniform velocity

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:25.250
down.

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:30.870
When I'm moving up, I generate
the front part of that pulse.

00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:35.560
When I'm moving down, I
generate the back part.

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:36.650
Then, I stop.

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:38.240
I'm doing nothing.

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.870
The ring is doing nothing more.

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:43.350
The string is attached
to it horizontally.

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:48.930
But as a result of that
motion of the ring,

00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:54.710
I've introduced a triangular
distortion on the string.

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:59.780
That distortion will
now propagate forever

00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:03.506
with the phase velocity
square root T over mu.

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:15.960
I don't have to discuss how this
pulse is progressing forward.

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:18.920
That we've done in general,
or Professor Walter Lewin

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.180
has done in general.

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:24.620
He has shown that there
is this progressive wave

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:31.600
solution to the wave equation,
which describes this string.

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:36.160
OK, so we've finally
understood the motion

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:44.230
of the ring and the subsequent
motion of the pulse progressing

00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:45.850
down the string.

00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:47.520
End of that.

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:52.140
The next question was the
power delivered by the string.

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:56.950
Well, clearly, during the time
when the ring is stationary,

00:32:56.950 --> 00:33:00.160
isn't doing no work on anything.

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:05.170
My finger doesn't have to do any
work on the ring or the string.

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:07.610
There's no power generating.

00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:16.300
But during the time when
I was moving the ring up,

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:20.240
I had to exert a force.

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:24.155
So I was pulling with a force.

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:29.870
Therefore, I was doing work.

00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:36.110
And the rate of doing work is
the power that I'm generating.

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:39.220
Similarly when I'm
going down, I will

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:43.810
have to do work against
the force, the tension

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:48.910
in the string, and I
will be exerting power

00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:50.290
during that time.

00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:52.700
How do we calculate that?

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:57.410
Well, I repeat what
I said earlier,

00:33:57.410 --> 00:33:59.580
so I don't have to
look at the board.

00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:07.030
The instantaneous power
generated or exerted by a force

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:11.920
is force dot the velocity.

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:13.620
OK.

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:17.320
Now, we did calculate the force.

00:34:23.417 --> 00:34:27.420
Sorry, we can
calculate the force

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:33.300
that I have to generate
to move this ring.

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:36.370
I'm just redrawing
the sketch for you.

00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:38.139
Here is the ring.

00:34:38.139 --> 00:34:39.250
What are the forces?

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:42.150
I am repeating, there is
the reaction force here.

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:45.980
That's this force F
which I am exerting.

00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:49.679
And I've chosen this
picture at the time

00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:52.770
when the string is like this.

00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:57.440
At other times, the string
will be in that direction.

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:59.420
But I've sketched
this at a time when

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:01.560
the string is in this direction.

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:02.955
That is the tension in it.

00:35:02.955 --> 00:35:05.770
It exerts a force.

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:07.940
So those are the three forces.

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:11.970
And as I've discussed earlier,
this is a massless ring.

00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:14.980
Therefore, there's no net force.

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:19.990
At this instant, this
force must be equal

00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:25.020
and in the opposite direction
than the vertical component

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:31.230
of this tension T.
So it is equal to T

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:33.590
times the tangent of this angle.

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:39.260
So at that instant of time,
the magnitude of this force--

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:45.470
and it's in the up direction--
is plus T H over L over 2,

00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:49.050
which is 2H T over L.

00:35:49.050 --> 00:35:52.320
This corresponds
to the period when

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:55.020
the string is like
this at the ring.

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:58.530
And earlier on, I told
you that corresponds

00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:02.190
to this time interval.

00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:03.560
OK.

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:05.650
Later, I've reached the top.

00:36:05.650 --> 00:36:08.520
I'm starting to move down.

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:13.590
The string now is upwards,
but the angle is the same.

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:16.160
And so the force
that I have to exert

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:19.670
is the same magnitude as this
but in the opposite direction.

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:21.880
Hence, the minus sign.

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:25.040
So it's minus T over
that, which is minus

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:29.550
2H T over L. The two
are, of course, equal.

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:33.630
So I first have to--
it actually makes

00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:35.550
sense if you imagine a string.

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:41.680
If I want to distort it
up, I have to pull on that.

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:45.460
Later on, I want to
pull it in the opposite.

00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:47.390
I pull it down.

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:51.570
Those are the two types.

00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:55.070
So we know at every
instant of time

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:58.960
what is the force that I
exert and the direction of it.

00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:09.810
Now, the power that I generate
is the force dot velocity.

00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:16.580
So I have to take the dot
product between this force

00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:20.660
and the corresponding velocity.

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:23.290
All the motion is
up and down, so I

00:37:23.290 --> 00:37:27.200
don't have to-- I'm doing
just the components.

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:30.170
And so the dot product is
just the multiplication

00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:32.370
of the force times the velocity.

00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:34.430
And the only thing I
have to watch out for

00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:36.710
is whether they're in
the same direction,

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:38.490
in the opposite direction.

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:45.520
Notice that when the
transverse velocity is

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:49.530
positive-- in other
words, upwards-- that's

00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:52.920
the time when I'm
pulling upwards.

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:59.590
And so the force and the
velocity have the same sign.

00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:04.660
So the power I
exert is this 2H T

00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:11.130
over L times the transverse
velocity 2v H over L. OK?

00:38:14.342 --> 00:38:28.650
Now, afterwards when we change
to the other-- the back edge,

00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:31.820
the force reverses.

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:34.180
It's minus.

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:36.900
So that's the
transverse velocity.

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:40.810
And so that product,
once again, is positive.

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:48.690
So both on the leading edge of
that pulse and the back edge,

00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:53.270
I do positive amount of work.

00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:57.770
I do work on the ring
and not the ring on me.

00:38:57.770 --> 00:39:02.390
And of course,
immediately that power

00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:04.590
is transmitted to the string.

00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:08.950
So for both the front edge and
the back edge of the piles,

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:12.140
I have to do work on the string.

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:15.080
It's positive.

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:20.260
And at every instant of
time during my motion,

00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:24.420
this is the power.

00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:29.690
It's the product of the force
times the transverse velocity.

00:39:29.690 --> 00:39:33.950
So this now is true
for the complete time

00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:40.370
period during which I
am generating the pulse.

00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:41.760
OK.

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:48.690
I can now plot what
is the power that I

00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:51.350
have to exert as a
function of time.

00:39:51.350 --> 00:39:56.110
So here is the power and
in this direction is time.

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:58.990
And what we've shown
from a time of L

00:39:58.990 --> 00:40:04.440
over v to a time 2L
over v. And by the way,

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:10.770
just I'm reminding you,
halfway through-- this

00:40:10.770 --> 00:40:12.840
is when I'm moving
it in one direction.

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:13.750
This is in the other.

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:16.690
But the power is
positive in both cases.

00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:21.820
So this is the power
as a function of time.

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:24.890
And so what is the
total energy that I

00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:32.260
have to give to the string
to produce that pulse?

00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:37.360
Well, total energy
given is the integral

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:42.140
of the power over the
time during which I

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:43.720
exert that power.

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:50.360
So it's the integral of P
of t dt over that interval.

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:53.690
Well, that's just the
area of that pulse.

00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:56.480
So it's this height
times this time.

00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:02.520
And if I do that, I get-- if
I take this and multiply it

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:08.540
by that length, I get
4H squared T over L.

00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:12.600
All right, so we've now
understood what the ring does.

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:18.740
We understand how
much energy I had

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:24.510
to apply to it in order
to generate that pulse.

00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:31.150
OK, finally we were asked about
something about the pulse.

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:34.820
I've put some energy into
it, where did that energy go?

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:40.690
That energy went into the
potential energy stored because

00:41:40.690 --> 00:41:44.990
of the shape of the pulse
and the kinetic energy in it.

00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:49.180
So the essence of the
next parts of the question

00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:54.320
is, let's now, from first
principles-- knowing

00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:58.930
what pulse we have, let's try to
calculate how much energy we've

00:41:58.930 --> 00:42:03.150
stored in the pulse in the
form of potential energy.

00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:06.230
How much energy we've
stored in the pulse

00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:08.670
in the form of kinetic energy.

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:11.330
And just to check that
we didn't make a mistake,

00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:13.140
let's see that
energy is conserved.

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:15.930
We know the total energy
we've put into the system.

00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:19.080
Let's see whether that's
equal to the potential energy

00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:20.580
plus the kinetic energy.

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:22.550
Of course, it's going
to work out right,

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:25.150
so it's more a test I
haven't made a mistake.

00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:27.930
And we are not going to discover
non-conservation of energy

00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:29.140
here.

00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:33.350
OK, so now let's
try to calculate

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:36.930
how much potential energy
is stored in the pulse.

00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:48.070
OK, you can do it many ways.

00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:51.810
But normally, I like
going to first principles.

00:42:51.810 --> 00:42:55.840
This string normally in
equilibrium is straight.

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:01.780
In the moving pulse,
it is distorted.

00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:04.560
It's this shape.

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:10.000
In order to distort it to this
shape-- and ti doesn't matter,

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.600
I'm talking at some
instant of time.

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:15.560
I don't care whether anything
is moving here or not.

00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:20.540
At some instant of time,
this has a certain amount

00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:22.130
of potential energy.

00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:25.590
It is the energy
stored in the system

00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:32.100
because it is distorted from
its equilibrium straight path.

00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:37.250
I don't care whether any
piece here is moving or not.

00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:38.880
That's nothing to
the potential energy.

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:42.370
How much energy is there if I
have a piece of string shaped

00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:44.990
like this whether it's
part of the pulse or not?

00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:46.480
Irrelevant.

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:49.430
OK, how do we do it?

00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:54.000
I will do a thought experiment,
a Gedanken experiment.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:59.730
I will imagine I took a
string, nailed these points.

00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:04.840
They don't move separated by
a distance L. In the middle,

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:10.000
I get hold of this and
from it being straight,

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.040
I start pulling up.

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:14.060
All right?

00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:17.510
Until I reach a height H.

00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:21.660
At that stage, I've
generated this shape.

00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:24.950
The potential
energy in that shape

00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:31.070
must come from the work
I did in distorting it.

00:44:31.070 --> 00:44:33.070
How much work do I do?

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:38.180
Well, I have to exert
a force pulling it up.

00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:43.890
And the integral of that force
times the total distance, that

00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:46.450
will be the total
work I have done.

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:48.250
So that's what I have to do.

00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:48.750
All right?

00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:51.430
So what I'm doing?

00:44:51.430 --> 00:45:00.110
I'm going to integrate from this
height being 0 to the height

00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:03.310
being H. I mean,
integral is just

00:45:03.310 --> 00:45:09.960
the addition of bits of
work as I pull this up.

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:20.270
So integral of the force,
which I call little f of y dy.

00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:22.325
Now, what is the force?

00:45:26.012 --> 00:45:27.720
I'm not [INAUDIBLE]
where I'm doing this.

00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:32.640
I'm doing it, pulling it up
very slowly at uniform velocity.

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:35.690
So I'm not
accelerating anything.

00:45:35.690 --> 00:45:43.520
So the net force on this must be
equal and opposite to the force

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:48.220
exacted on my fingers
by this string.

00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:51.110
Well, there is a
tension in this string

00:45:51.110 --> 00:45:53.090
pulling in these directions.

00:45:53.090 --> 00:45:55.440
The horizontal components
of the tensions

00:45:55.440 --> 00:46:00.160
cancel, but the
vertical ones add up.

00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:03.810
The two vertical components
of the string on this side

00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:08.422
and that are equal and
opposite to my force f.

00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:14.720
Now, what we said,
the assumption

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:18.650
here is that this
distortion is so small

00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:21.480
that in the process of me
pulling this and changing it,

00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:24.020
this tension does not change.

00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:27.490
In reality, it would
change slightly.

00:46:27.490 --> 00:46:30.910
But if this is small
enough, it's negligible.

00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:32.460
So I'm going to
make the assumption

00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:37.010
that this tension does not
change as I'm moving this up.

00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:42.120
So the force I'll be applying
will be constant, actually.

00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:44.220
And so what that is?

00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:49.630
Well, it's twice the tension
times the component of it,

00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:55.530
this tangent of the angle in the
vertical direction from 0 to H

00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:56.740
times dy.

00:46:56.740 --> 00:47:02.105
But as I say, T will be
constant throughout this period.

00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:13.310
But y-- there is a y here,
which is not a constant.

00:47:13.310 --> 00:47:16.710
This goes from 0 to H.
And so if I integrate

00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:23.830
that with respect to y, I'll get
y squared over 2 from 0 to H.

00:47:23.830 --> 00:47:30.590
And so this integral is equal
4T H squared over L over 2.

00:47:30.590 --> 00:47:33.770
This 2 is from the
integral of y dy.

00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:38.650
It's y squared over 2 taken
from those limits gives me that.

00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:43.550
OK, which is 2H
squared T over L.

00:47:43.550 --> 00:47:48.930
This is the work I did
distorting the string.

00:47:48.930 --> 00:47:52.880
It must be equal to
the energy stored

00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:55.070
in the string in that process.

00:47:55.070 --> 00:47:58.170
OK, so we've answered that part.

00:47:58.170 --> 00:48:00.640
How about the kinetic energy?

00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:09.000
There is a pulse which
is moving to the right.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.860
Meaning that every piece of
this string from here to here

00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:16.240
is actually in motion.

00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:17.790
Over here, it's stationary.

00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:20.200
Over here, it's stationary.

00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:25.890
But to the left of center,
every piece in here

00:48:25.890 --> 00:48:29.240
it's actually moving down.

00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:32.580
We discussed that earlier.

00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:35.145
Every piece along
here is moving up.

00:48:38.050 --> 00:48:40.820
The result is you
get the impression

00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:44.900
of the pulse moving
to the right.

00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:53.680
But the actual motion of the
mass is down here and up here.

00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:59.670
So at any instant of time
when you have this pulse,

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:03.930
there is kinetic energy of
the string in this piece

00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:07.020
and in that piece.

00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:09.610
And we have to calculate that.

00:49:09.610 --> 00:49:11.920
They are both positive
kinetic energy.

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:14.690
There is no such thing as
negative kinetic energy.

00:49:14.690 --> 00:49:15.700
So those are moving.

00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:19.550
And the transverse velocity
is down and here up.

00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:22.470
Kinetic energy is 1/2 mass
times velocity squared.

00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:24.690
They're both positive, OK?

00:49:24.690 --> 00:49:27.960
So let's now just calculate.

00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:31.315
Again, it will be
the integral, the sum

00:49:31.315 --> 00:49:34.230
of the kinetic energy of
every piece along here.

00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:39.930
So if I take a piece
of mass dm multiply it

00:49:39.930 --> 00:49:45.400
by 1/2 times its transverse--
the motion of that mass

00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:47.250
squared.

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:50.000
That's the total
velocity of that mass.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.460
It's not moving horizontally.

00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:55.890
We've made that assumption
in this idealized case.

00:49:55.890 --> 00:50:00.055
So this is the kinetic energy
of a piece of the mass.

00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:06.940
And I have to integrate that
over all the pieces of m

00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:08.460
from here to here.

00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:11.610
There's no kinetic
energy there and there.

00:50:11.610 --> 00:50:13.900
OK, this is a
constant, actually.

00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:23.010
It's only true because
this is a straight line

00:50:23.010 --> 00:50:25.830
that this pulse consists
of two straight lines.

00:50:25.830 --> 00:50:29.280
If it wasn't, it
would not be constant.

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:34.090
So this integral
is that 1/2 times

00:50:34.090 --> 00:50:36.540
this transverse
velocity, which we

00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:41.860
calculated earlier
the transverse.

00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:46.342
We've calculated over here
the transverse velocity.

00:50:46.342 --> 00:50:51.740
And you can see it's independent
of position of the string.

00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:52.790
So back to here.

00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:55.660
So we know that
transverse velocity.

00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:58.180
And what is the piece of mass?

00:50:58.180 --> 00:51:01.955
Well, that will be the
density of the string, mass

00:51:01.955 --> 00:51:06.120
per unit length mu times
the little piece of string

00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:07.330
of length l.

00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:14.360
This is a trivial integral,
so they're all constants here.

00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:22.320
By the way, this
integral-- maybe

00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:28.686
I should've said it-- goes
over a length from 0 to L.

00:51:28.686 --> 00:51:32.370
That's the length of the
string we're considering.

00:51:32.370 --> 00:51:36.270
So we get up with that
equal to that, which

00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:45.190
is equal to-- because
I could replace v. We

00:51:45.190 --> 00:51:50.250
know v. v is the square
root of T over mu.

00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:55.120
And so if I replace v by
v squared by T over mu,

00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:58.020
it cancels the mu,
but we get a T here.

00:51:58.020 --> 00:52:03.760
And so the total energy,
kinetic energy, is this.

00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:05.900
And we are essentially whole.

00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:12.090
Because now we've calculated
the total potential energy

00:52:12.090 --> 00:52:13.520
stored in the pulse.

00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:17.430
We've calculated the
total kinetic energy.

00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:21.360
So the total energy
stored in that policy

00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:25.990
is the sum of those two,
which is of course, 4H squared

00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:33.780
T over L. So in other words,
as this pulse moves along, it

00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:38.800
has a total energy of this
plus that 4H squared T over L.

00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:40.610
And it will continue forever.

00:52:40.610 --> 00:52:45.190
Energy is conserved,
it will go forever.

00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:47.150
Where did it come from?

00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:55.250
We said it came from
the motion of the ring.

00:52:55.250 --> 00:53:00.430
And I calculated how much
energy I did initially.

00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:07.900
It was 4H squared T over L. And
lo and behold, big surprise,

00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:11.500
it's exactly what's
in the pulse.

00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:17.300
So the work I do is
right at the beginning.

00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:21.850
The work I do is at the time
when I generate the pulse.

00:53:21.850 --> 00:53:26.610
From then on, the energy
just progresses forever.

00:53:26.610 --> 00:53:32.000
That's the end to that problem.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.710
We'll now deal with
the next problem.

00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:37.580
So we now come to
the second problem

00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:40.030
to do with progressive waves.

00:53:40.030 --> 00:53:43.670
And the problem I've
taken is the following.

00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:47.560
You have two coaxial cables.

00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:50.530
They're connected at some place.

00:53:50.530 --> 00:53:55.820
And we are told that on the
left cable-- this one here,

00:53:55.820 --> 00:54:02.490
left cable-- there is a
voltage at every location given

00:54:02.490 --> 00:54:10.240
by v1 cosine omega 1t
minus 2 pi over lambda 1t.

00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:12.550
And there is some kind
of reflection to it.

00:54:12.550 --> 00:54:15.170
They don't tell
us much about it.

00:54:15.170 --> 00:54:17.340
On the right-hand
side, they tell

00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:22.790
us the voltage wave
v2 cosine omega

00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:27.060
2t minus 2 pi lambda 2 over t.

00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:31.080
And furthermore,
they tell us that we

00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:36.680
have to assume that these
cables are ideal and lossless.

00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:37.910
That's one.

00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:41.080
That the phase velocity
on the left one

00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:47.620
is v1 and that whenever
there is a voltage on it

00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:50.600
at any location,
there is a current,

00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:55.360
which is v1 divided
by some constant z1.

00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:59.770
So on the left one, the
phase velocity v1 and I1

00:54:59.770 --> 00:55:01.360
is v1 over z1.

00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:07.340
And on the right cable,
the phase velocity is v2

00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:12.230
and the current
I2 is v2 over z2.

00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:18.700
The question is, what is the
ratio of omega 2 to omega 1?

00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:22.290
What's the ratio of
lambda 2 to lambda 1?

00:55:22.290 --> 00:55:25.550
And what's the
ratio of v2 to v1?

00:55:25.550 --> 00:55:30.450
Now, you may have never
seen a coaxial cable.

00:55:30.450 --> 00:55:32.010
You may have seen
a coaxial cable,

00:55:32.010 --> 00:55:34.960
but you've never discussed
it or learned about it.

00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:39.630
Certainly, Professor Walter
Lewin did not cover this.

00:55:39.630 --> 00:55:41.390
Why did I do this problem?

00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:47.665
Precisely to show that by
learning how to solve problems

00:55:47.665 --> 00:55:50.810
or understanding
progressive waves

00:55:50.810 --> 00:55:54.020
on one system like
this string, we

00:55:54.020 --> 00:55:57.130
can do transfer
the whole knowledge

00:55:57.130 --> 00:56:03.910
we have to understanding how to
analyze, in fact, a much more

00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:05.200
interesting situation.

00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:08.620
A situation you'll
come across very often

00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:14.090
in life, progressive
waves down coaxial cables.

00:56:14.090 --> 00:56:19.000
Now, from the way the
problem is worded,

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.390
we can in fact
conclude that we should

00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:25.320
be able to solve this problem
from our knowledge of what

00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:30.560
happens on taut string.

00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:33.610
We are told that
on this one, there

00:56:33.610 --> 00:56:36.590
is a voltage, which
has this form.

00:56:36.590 --> 00:56:38.640
If you look at
this form, this is

00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:53.210
a function of some constants
times time minus-- I'm sorry,

00:56:53.210 --> 00:56:54.930
this should be an x and an x.

00:56:54.930 --> 00:57:03.600
Let me immediately correct
this, x here and x here.

00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:09.710
So it's a function of
some constant times

00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:13.010
t minus a constant times x.

00:57:13.010 --> 00:57:19.470
And we know that such a function
represents a progressive wave.

00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:21.960
If you plot this
at different times

00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:24.410
and different locations,
what you will see

00:57:24.410 --> 00:57:30.960
is a sinusoidal
function which is

00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:35.570
moving to the right with some,
what we call, phase velocity.

00:57:35.570 --> 00:57:38.390
Which in the problem,
they tell us what it is.

00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:40.110
It's v1.

00:57:40.110 --> 00:57:42.230
So from this form,
we immediately

00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:46.460
realize that the
voltage on this cable

00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:50.450
is a progressive wave,
which is going to the right.

00:57:50.450 --> 00:57:54.780
Therefore, this
system, the cable,

00:57:54.780 --> 00:57:59.740
must have a wave
equation for it to have

00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:05.760
a wave as a solution-- a
progressive wave as a solution.

00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:06.840
OK, next.

00:58:11.790 --> 00:58:15.400
If we know omega
1, what is omega 2?

00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:18.400
If we know omega 1,
what is lambda 1?

00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:19.690
What is lambda 2?

00:58:19.690 --> 00:58:24.380
And if we know v1, what is v2?

00:58:24.380 --> 00:58:30.410
In other words, we
immediately realize

00:58:30.410 --> 00:58:35.740
that these two-- the
angular frequencies here

00:58:35.740 --> 00:58:41.350
or the wavelengths of
the progressive waves--

00:58:41.350 --> 00:58:46.420
do not necessarily have
the same phase velocity.

00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:50.270
And in fact, they tell
us that it is different.

00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:55.140
So the propagation down these
two cables will be different.

00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:59.380
And so these cables must
be made structurally

00:58:59.380 --> 00:59:00.460
in a different way.

00:59:00.460 --> 00:59:03.210
They are different
cables, but they're just

00:59:03.210 --> 00:59:05.590
connected together.

00:59:05.590 --> 00:59:06.740
OK.

00:59:06.740 --> 00:59:08.300
And of course,
electrically-- that's

00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:13.190
the other thing I should-- the
outside has to be connected.

00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:17.120
All right, how do we proceed?

00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:21.920
So as I started saying, from
the wording of the problem

00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:27.780
we immediately conclude that
a coaxial cable, in fact,

00:59:27.780 --> 00:59:32.730
is the continuum limit of
some row of oscillators.

00:59:32.730 --> 00:59:34.420
Is that surprising?

00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:41.060
Well, if you stop and think and
magnified the coaxial cable,

00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:45.280
in essence what you see
is two parallel wires.

00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:47.970
They have a capacitance
with each other.

00:59:47.970 --> 00:59:52.040
The two conductors
have the central wire

00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:54.780
and the sheathing around that.

00:59:54.780 --> 00:59:58.430
Each have self-inductance.

00:59:58.430 --> 01:00:01.950
And so schematically, it
looks something like this.

01:00:01.950 --> 01:00:07.980
You have a row of inductances,
a row of capacitances

01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:09.040
connected like this.

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:14.830
So this is a schematic
diagram of a coaxial cable.

01:00:14.830 --> 01:00:15.650
What is this?

01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:19.820
Nothing other than
each piece here

01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:24.980
is like a simple
harmonic oscillator

01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:27.100
we've solved many times.

01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:30.760
It's simply an inductance
in the capacitance.

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:37.110
And they are furthermore,
identical harmonic oscillators

01:00:37.110 --> 01:00:41.140
only connected to
their neighbors.

01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:44.950
And so this, from
a point of view

01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:48.120
of the response
of this system, is

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:54.460
identical to a taut string,
where at each point in the s

01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:58.560
we had a harmonic oscillator
which was connected only

01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:00.730
to its neighbors.

01:01:00.730 --> 01:01:05.060
So the equation of
motion for this system--

01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:09.670
well, the variable
was the voltage,

01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:12.830
the potential difference
between the central conductors

01:01:12.830 --> 01:01:17.050
and the outside conductor,
must satisfy a wave equation

01:01:17.050 --> 01:01:23.300
like this where v is
the phase velocity

01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:26.100
of the propagation
of v down the cable.

01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:28.360
And we are told on
the left-hand side

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:32.290
is v1, on the
right-hand side is v2.

01:01:32.290 --> 01:01:35.460
Furthermore, in the
problem they told us

01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:43.470
that if there is a voltage
propagating down this cable,

01:01:43.470 --> 01:01:46.660
there will also be a
current propagating.

01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:51.780
And they tell us that the ratio
of the voltage to the current

01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:53.800
is a constant.

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:57.090
And it's different
for the two cables.

01:01:57.090 --> 01:02:00.290
In fact, let me sort
of digress and tell you

01:02:00.290 --> 01:02:02.830
it is the two
quantities, the phase

01:02:02.830 --> 01:02:05.990
velocity and this
constant z, which

01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:10.040
is called the characteristic
impedance, which

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:12.975
characterizes any coaxial cable.

01:02:12.975 --> 01:02:18.100
Or in fact, any system
consisting of two parallel

01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:19.610
conductors.

01:02:19.610 --> 01:02:24.100
So a wire, typical
two-conductor wire,

01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:27.510
would be a coaxial
cable in that sense.

01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:32.230
Since I is proportional to
the voltage, if this satisfies

01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:35.180
the wave equation
so must the current.

01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:36.340
OK.

01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:38.980
Furthermore, what
do they tell us?

01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:42.620
They tell us that if you look
at the first cable, the one

01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:46.780
on the left, we see the
progressive wave going

01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:48.030
to the right.

01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:52.280
But also, there may be a
reflected wave they tell us.

01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:53.950
On the right-hand
side, they tell

01:02:53.950 --> 01:02:58.210
us there is only a
propagating wave to the right.

01:02:58.210 --> 01:03:01.000
From that, I can immediately
conclude something

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.240
about the boundary
conditions of this system.

01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:08.520
Take the right-hand side.

01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:12.550
There's a wave going to the
right, but nothing to the left.

01:03:12.550 --> 01:03:16.480
Therefore, there
must be no reflection

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:23.570
of the progressive wave at the
far end of the right cable.

01:03:23.570 --> 01:03:25.220
How about the left cable?

01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:28.430
Well, the pulse is coming in.

01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:34.160
There is a junction between two
cables which are not the same.

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:38.420
And whenever you have
such a situation where

01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:44.710
you have a continuous
system of oscillators coming

01:03:44.710 --> 01:03:47.180
to another continuous
system, like two

01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:49.620
wires of different
density for example,

01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:52.940
or different tensions, or
something of that kind,

01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:56.730
at the junction you are
going to get a reflection.

01:03:56.730 --> 01:04:01.230
So where you're going to get
a reflection at that junction,

01:04:01.230 --> 01:04:04.240
that reflected wave will
go all the way to the left,

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:07.220
come to the far
end of that cable.

01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:09.480
And normally it would
be reflected there

01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:12.960
unless one works hard to
prevent that from happening.

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:16.324
And here, they're
telling us nothing

01:04:16.324 --> 01:04:20.420
is-- there's no reflection.

01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:24.730
There isn't any further
reflection from that side.

01:04:24.730 --> 01:04:30.700
There is just the original pulse
coming from left to the right.

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:39.440
OK, so now, how do we answer
the questions they do?

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:43.360
And so now, I will
go from what we've

01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:46.670
learned about the
physical system

01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:50.610
to a mathematical
description of it.

01:04:50.610 --> 01:04:53.910
And at this stage,
you probably won't

01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:55.630
be able to almost
tell the difference

01:04:55.630 --> 01:05:04.070
with I'm talking about-- two
strings connected together

01:05:04.070 --> 01:05:08.110
or I'm talking a coaxial cable.

01:05:08.110 --> 01:05:11.212
The behavior, mathematical
behavior, will be the same.

01:05:11.212 --> 01:05:13.270
The mathematical description
will be the same.

01:05:15.810 --> 01:05:17.760
I should digress for a second.

01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:19.400
If you're curious
what happens here,

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:22.750
I was talking about
two pulses going down,

01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:25.900
the voltage pulse
and the current.

01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:27.500
What happens on the string?

01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:31.760
Well, in a string there
are also many pulses.

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:34.740
We normally don't talk
about all of them.

01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:40.050
For example, if you
have a propagating pulse

01:05:40.050 --> 01:05:45.440
of displacement on
a string, then there

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:49.860
will be also a pulse
going down corresponding

01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:55.630
to the transverse velocity
of the string at every point.

01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:57.510
So there's already two.

01:05:57.510 --> 01:05:59.220
There's another one.

01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:03.350
As the pulse on a
string goes along,

01:06:03.350 --> 01:06:06.890
the left part of the
string acts a force

01:06:06.890 --> 01:06:12.760
on the right part of the
string to generate that pulse.

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:14.360
And that also propagates.

01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:17.620
So even on a simple
thing like a string,

01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:23.480
there will be simultaneously
three progressive waves

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:27.300
going down the string--
the displacement,

01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:30.410
the transverse
velocity, and the force.

01:06:30.410 --> 01:06:35.380
Here, we are talking about two--
the current and the voltage.

01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:43.800
All right, so I've translated
what I've discussed before.

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:48.620
I'll call x equals 0 the
junction between the two

01:06:48.620 --> 01:06:50.330
cables.

01:06:50.330 --> 01:06:53.350
On the left and on
the vertical axis

01:06:53.350 --> 01:06:59.830
here, I'm going to either
be plotting the voltage

01:06:59.830 --> 01:07:03.850
across the cable or the
current flowing down the cable.

01:07:03.850 --> 01:07:08.400
I'm just too lazy to
draw two separate plots.

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:12.130
So what we are told,
there is the voltage,

01:07:12.130 --> 01:07:15.460
which is given by
this expression.

01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:19.630
That's a progressive wave, a
sinusoidal progressive wave

01:07:19.630 --> 01:07:22.720
moving to the right.

01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:32.090
There is a reflected one, which
is given by some amplitude,

01:07:32.090 --> 01:07:34.470
v reflected times cosine.

01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:38.410
And this will now
have a plus sign

01:07:38.410 --> 01:07:41.500
because it's now
propagating to the left.

01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:45.000
Here, the minus sign tells
you it's going to the right.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.700
The plus sign going to the left.

01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:54.720
Now, we know from-- for
example, our studies

01:07:54.720 --> 01:08:01.940
of coupled oscillators, that
in a steady state situation,

01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:08.365
every oscillator is moving with
the same frequency and phase.

01:08:08.365 --> 01:08:13.620
So if I extend that
to the infinite case,

01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:20.609
I know that the
frequency of this wave,

01:08:20.609 --> 01:08:22.390
which was only one frequency.

01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:25.640
So the progressive
wave going this way

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:30.420
has only one frequency, omega 1.

01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:37.910
If it drives the oscillators
as it goes along,

01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:41.790
it will drive them to
oscillate at the same frequency

01:08:41.790 --> 01:08:43.740
as its frequency.

01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:46.090
Another way to say
it, in this problem

01:08:46.090 --> 01:08:48.020
there's only one frequency.

01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:51.390
And so the reflected wave
will have the same frequency

01:08:51.390 --> 01:08:53.460
as the incoming one.

01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:59.279
Similarly, the transmitted wave
will have the same frequency.

01:08:59.279 --> 01:09:02.740
That's why I wrote this
to be equal to that.

01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:06.365
We can actually
formally show that that

01:09:06.365 --> 01:09:10.330
has to be the case
by considering

01:09:10.330 --> 01:09:13.069
what happens at the boundary.

01:09:13.069 --> 01:09:17.310
You could never have
the two separate halves

01:09:17.310 --> 01:09:20.130
moving with different
frequencies and the string

01:09:20.130 --> 01:09:21.689
not be broken.

01:09:21.689 --> 01:09:28.939
Or in this case, the
voltage being not the same

01:09:28.939 --> 01:09:32.140
on both sides of the
string, on both sides

01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:34.910
of the boundary of the string.

01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:37.620
OK, so everything we
learned over there

01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:40.960
we can write as this
sinusoidal progressive wave

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:44.630
to the right with amplitude
v1, the reflected wave

01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:48.290
with amplitude v reflected.

01:09:48.290 --> 01:09:54.760
And there will be a transmitted
wave of some magnitude v2.

01:09:54.760 --> 01:10:02.120
And a cosine omega 2t
minus 2 pi lambda to the x.

01:10:04.970 --> 01:10:07.950
I went ahead of
myself to explain

01:10:07.950 --> 01:10:12.360
that this omega 1 has
to be the same as that.

01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:15.220
In a second using
the same argument,

01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:19.580
I'll show that this has
to be equal to that.

01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:22.840
What else do we know
about the situation?

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:26.460
Well, we know that
at the boundary,

01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:29.020
the two y's are connected.

01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:33.570
Therefore, there will be the
same potential difference

01:10:33.570 --> 01:10:38.210
between the central conductor
and the outside conductor

01:10:38.210 --> 01:10:40.870
just to the left of the
boundary and to the right.

01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:47.730
So at x equals 0 for all
times, the voltage VL

01:10:47.730 --> 01:10:53.090
will be equal to the
potential difference

01:10:53.090 --> 01:10:54.520
on the right-hand side.

01:10:54.520 --> 01:11:00.300
So that's one
boundary condition.

01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:05.970
The other one, we know
that charges are conserved.

01:11:05.970 --> 01:11:10.380
And therefore, if you have
junction of two wires,

01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:13.850
the total current going
into that junction

01:11:13.850 --> 01:11:16.345
or coming away from
it must be 0 or you

01:11:16.345 --> 01:11:18.300
would be creating charges.

01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:23.420
So the sum of all the
currents coming in or out

01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:29.670
from the junction for all
times and x equals 0 must be 0.

01:11:29.670 --> 01:11:31.910
So this is now all
in mathematics.

01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:34.890
You don't need to
know this, but this

01:11:34.890 --> 01:11:39.470
is anything to do with
voltages, currents, et cetera.

01:11:39.470 --> 01:11:43.000
This is the mathematical
description of the situation.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:48.830
And let's try to now answer
the questions that were posed.

01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:52.190
OK, the first
question was, what is

01:11:52.190 --> 01:11:55.070
the ratio of omega 2 to omega 1?

01:11:55.070 --> 01:11:57.480
And I've answered it already.

01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:01.620
The only frequency in
this problem is omega 1.

01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:03.310
That's what comes in.

01:12:03.310 --> 01:12:07.930
It'll drive any oscillator
anywhere at that frequency

01:12:07.930 --> 01:12:11.070
under the steady-state
conditions, which we have here.

01:12:11.070 --> 01:12:17.097
So omega 2 must equal to omega
1 or that ratio is equal to 1.

01:12:17.097 --> 01:12:17.680
First problem.

01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:20.170
The next question
we were asked, what

01:12:20.170 --> 01:12:24.310
is the ratio of the wavelengths?

01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:35.820
Now, we know that for
any harmonic wave,

01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:39.620
the product of the wavelengths
times the frequency

01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:41.560
is the phase velocity.

01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:43.380
You can trivially
prove it for yourself.

01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:49.620
Just take that formula
for the progressive wave,

01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:51.825
harmonic progressive
wave, and calculate

01:12:51.825 --> 01:12:53.410
what the frequency is.

01:12:53.410 --> 01:12:57.000
And if you have
difficulty, draw the wave

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.780
as a function of
position at 2 times

01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:03.710
and see how far that
picture has moved.

01:13:03.710 --> 01:13:09.720
And you'll find that lambda
times f is equal to v. OK.

01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:12.570
This is true to the
left of the boundary

01:13:12.570 --> 01:13:16.380
and on the right-hand side.

01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:20.890
So I've rewritten this lambda
times omega over 2 pi equals

01:13:20.890 --> 01:13:26.940
v. Therefore, if you have two
strings of different phase

01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:32.210
velocity, for the first one
this equation looks like that.

01:13:32.210 --> 01:13:36.740
For the second one, it's the
same but 1's replaced by 2.

01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:40.360
From these, I immediately
divide one by the other,

01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:44.120
that lambda 2 over lambda
1 is equal to v2 over v1.

01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:45.930
They are no longer the same.

01:13:45.930 --> 01:13:48.450
The frequencies are the
same, but the wavelengths

01:13:48.450 --> 01:13:49.440
are different.

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:55.380
It depends on the properties
of the two cables.

01:13:55.380 --> 01:14:00.880
So we get that the wavelength
on the left-hand side, as I say,

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:03.780
will be a different wavelength
to the one on the right.

01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:06.550
And the ratio
between them will be

01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:12.100
that of the phase
velocity on both sides.

01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:14.650
All right, next.

01:14:14.650 --> 01:14:16.660
The third part of
the thing was, what's

01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:19.300
the ratio of the voltages?

01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:23.760
In other words, what is
the ratio of v2 to v1?

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:28.250
v1, I'm reminding
you, is the amplitude

01:14:28.250 --> 01:14:33.270
of the voltage wave that
comes from the left cable

01:14:33.270 --> 01:14:37.090
to the junction, and
then continues out

01:14:37.090 --> 01:14:38.730
with a different amplitude.

01:14:38.730 --> 01:14:41.640
What is that amplitude?

01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:44.930
To answer that, we make use
of the boundary conditions,

01:14:44.930 --> 01:14:47.960
which we discussed earlier.

01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:52.220
These boundary conditions
immediately tell us that how?

01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:54.320
Well, the first
boundary condition

01:14:54.320 --> 01:15:00.160
tells us that the voltage
just to the left of x equals 0

01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:02.850
must equal to just
to the right to it.

01:15:02.850 --> 01:15:09.070
Now on the left-hand side, you
have two waves-- one coming in,

01:15:09.070 --> 01:15:14.500
one coming out,
the reflected one.

01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:23.750
If you look at the equation
for VL at x equals 0,

01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:30.130
for all times you'll find
it's v1 times cosine omega

01:15:30.130 --> 01:15:34.510
1t plus v reflected
cosine omega 1t.

01:15:34.510 --> 01:15:40.410
On the right-hand side, you see
that it is v2 times-- again,

01:15:40.410 --> 01:15:43.170
with x equals 0 cosine omega 2t.

01:15:43.170 --> 01:15:45.970
But omega 2t is
equal to omega 1.

01:15:45.970 --> 01:15:50.050
And so at all times,
the cosines cancel

01:15:50.050 --> 01:15:55.020
and you end up that v1 plus
v reflected has to be v2.

01:15:55.020 --> 01:15:59.380
At all times that will
be true at x equals 0.

01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:01.080
So you have one equation.

01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:04.980
The other boundary condition
gives us the other one.

01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:08.150
We know that if there
is a wave coming

01:16:08.150 --> 01:16:12.060
in with amplitude v1, the
current that comes in,

01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:18.090
it told us in the formulation of
the problem, is that divided by

01:16:18.090 --> 01:16:21.580
z1, this characteristic
impedance.

01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:23.860
Similarly, for the
reflected wave.

01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:24.930
But we have to watch it.

01:16:24.930 --> 01:16:26.055
There is a sign difference.

01:16:26.055 --> 01:16:26.930
Because why?

01:16:26.930 --> 01:16:33.730
If the wave is coming from
the left to the right,

01:16:33.730 --> 01:16:37.330
if we call that a
positive current.

01:16:37.330 --> 01:16:41.020
After reflection if
it goes the other way,

01:16:41.020 --> 01:16:42.310
it will be a negative.

01:16:42.310 --> 01:16:44.910
We'll be subtracting
from that junction.

01:16:44.910 --> 01:16:47.630
So that's why there
is this minus.

01:16:47.630 --> 01:16:53.880
And then, this is the one--
this is the total current coming

01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:55.290
into the junction.

01:16:55.290 --> 01:16:58.770
And that's got to be equal to
the total current coming out

01:16:58.770 --> 01:17:03.210
on the other side, v2 over z2.

01:17:03.210 --> 01:17:07.910
From this, I just multiply by
z1, so I get this equation.

01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:10.470
And these are two trivial
algebraic equations.

01:17:10.470 --> 01:17:12.920
If I add them, I
get 2 v1, et cetera.

01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:15.920
From which, I get
that this is the case.

01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:21.070
And again, I notice I forget v1.

01:17:21.070 --> 01:17:22.010
OK.

01:17:22.010 --> 01:17:27.480
And so we get that
the v2 over v1

01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:30.330
is that quantity
which was given.

01:17:30.330 --> 01:17:33.470
And we've solved the three
parts of the problem.

01:17:33.470 --> 01:17:35.020
That's the end.

01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:37.030
And the thing that
I would just like

01:17:37.030 --> 01:17:39.300
you to keep in mind,
that if you come

01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:41.980
across some kind
of a problem to do

01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:43.990
with progressive
waves, et cetera.

01:17:43.990 --> 01:17:46.170
If you've never
seen the system, it

01:17:46.170 --> 01:17:48.520
doesn't mean you don't
know how to solve it.

01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:53.280
Stop, think, see by
analogy what it corresponds

01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:56.660
to a system which
you have understood.

01:17:56.660 --> 01:18:00.030
The corollary is, suppose
you are having trouble

01:18:00.030 --> 01:18:03.520
with progressive
waves on strings.

01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:05.680
But you're an
electrical engineer

01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:10.620
and you feel very comfortable
about waves on cables.

01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:15.380
You can use the study of
waves on cables, reflection

01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:19.570
of pulses, reflection
coefficients, transmission

01:18:19.570 --> 01:18:22.700
coefficients, et cetera.

01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:25.120
That which you've understood
in the electrical system,

01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:27.440
you can translate
it to what happens

01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:31.600
if you have mechanical
systems connected together.

01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:33.150
Thank you.
