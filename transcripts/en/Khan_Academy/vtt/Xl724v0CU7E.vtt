00:00:00.503 --> 00:00:03.080
- [Voiceover] In 2014,
the population of the

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:08.080
United States was about
318,900,000 people.

00:00:09.267 --> 00:00:11.067
Choose the best approximation of the

00:00:11.067 --> 00:00:14.898
United States population in 2014.

00:00:14.898 --> 00:00:16.941
So they say three times
10 to the eighth people

00:00:16.941 --> 00:00:18.767
or three times 10 to the ninth people.

00:00:18.767 --> 00:00:19.766
This is a big difference.

00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:20.775
This is a factor of 10.

00:00:20.775 --> 00:00:24.073
This is 10 times this right over here.

00:00:24.073 --> 00:00:25.651
So which one's closer?

00:00:25.651 --> 00:00:29.135
So if I were to round this to the nearest

00:00:29.135 --> 00:00:34.135
hundred million, this
would go to 300,000,000.

00:00:38.416 --> 00:00:42.173
300,000,000, this is
three times 100,000,000.

00:00:42.173 --> 00:00:44.912
This is the same thing as three times,

00:00:44.912 --> 00:00:49.637
three times 100,000,000.

00:00:49.637 --> 00:00:52.204
And 100,000,000 we see has eight zeros.

00:00:52.204 --> 00:00:55.593
So this is the same thing as
three times 10 to the eighth.

00:00:55.593 --> 00:00:58.115
Three times 10 to the eighth power,

00:00:58.115 --> 00:01:00.087
which they have right over here.

00:01:00.087 --> 00:01:01.000
Three times 10 to the ninth,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.147
that would be 3,000,000,000.

00:01:03.147 --> 00:01:04.646
That would be almost 10 times

00:01:04.646 --> 00:01:05.945
as large as this.

00:01:05.945 --> 00:01:07.779
So we would definitely
wanna go with this one.

00:01:07.779 --> 00:01:08.987
Three times 10 to the eight people

00:01:08.987 --> 00:01:10.206
is a pretty good approximation.

00:01:10.206 --> 00:01:12.331
This is 300,000,000 people.

00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:15.454
So we're kind of rounding
to the nearest 100,000,000.

00:01:15.454 --> 00:01:18.008
In 2014, the population of the world

00:01:18.008 --> 00:01:23.008
was about 7,125,000,000 people.

00:01:23.355 --> 00:01:24.669
Choose the best approximation

00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:27.871
of the world population in 2014.

00:01:27.871 --> 00:01:28.951
Well here we're dealing with,

00:01:28.951 --> 00:01:30.275
this is billions here,

00:01:30.275 --> 00:01:32.504
so let me just round
to the nearest billion.

00:01:32.504 --> 00:01:36.025
So we could say this is
roughly 7,000,000,000.

00:01:37.751 --> 00:01:39.445
So approximately 7,000,000,000

00:01:39.445 --> 00:01:41.904
if we're rounding to the nearest billion.

00:01:42.984 --> 00:01:44.812
A billion is 10 to the ninth.

00:01:44.812 --> 00:01:47.262
We see we have nine zeros here.

00:01:47.262 --> 00:01:48.202
So this is going to be equal

00:01:48.202 --> 00:01:52.753
to seven times 10 to the ninth power.

00:01:52.753 --> 00:01:54.215
Which is this right over here.

00:01:54.215 --> 00:01:55.841
This would be 700,000,000.

00:01:55.841 --> 00:01:57.662
This is less than a 10th

00:01:57.662 --> 00:01:59.712
of the actual world population.

00:01:59.712 --> 00:02:01.291
This is 7,000,000,000,

00:02:01.291 --> 00:02:02.950
which is, if you're rounding
to the nearest billion,

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.024
how many people there were in 2014.

00:02:06.376 --> 00:02:08.062
Approximately how many times larger

00:02:08.062 --> 00:02:10.012
was the world population,

00:02:10.012 --> 00:02:12.487
how many times larger
was the world population

00:02:12.487 --> 00:02:16.388
than the United States population in 2014?

00:02:16.388 --> 00:02:18.925
Well what was the world population?

00:02:18.925 --> 00:02:21.003
Once again, they're taking approximately.

00:02:21.003 --> 00:02:23.533
They're saying two, 20, 200.

00:02:23.533 --> 00:02:24.950
So if we're saying approximately,

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.227
see the world population,

00:02:26.227 --> 00:02:27.912
if we're using the approximation,

00:02:27.912 --> 00:02:31.673
was seven times 10 to the ninth power,

00:02:31.673 --> 00:02:33.008
and the United States population,

00:02:33.008 --> 00:02:35.922
we said it was roughly, in 2014,

00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:37.755
three times 10 to the eighth.

00:02:37.755 --> 00:02:42.755
So we could divide the world population,

00:02:42.934 --> 00:02:45.039
or our approximation of
the world population,

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:47.993
by our approximation of the
United States population.

00:02:47.993 --> 00:02:50.652
So our approximation
of the world population

00:02:50.652 --> 00:02:52.277
divided by the approximation

00:02:52.277 --> 00:02:53.960
of the United States population,

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.758
three times 10 to the eight power,

00:02:56.758 --> 00:02:58.500
well what's that going to be?

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.019
This is going to be approximately,

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.653
well, this is actually
going to be exactly 7/3.

00:03:04.653 --> 00:03:08.214
So we could say seven divided by three,

00:03:08.214 --> 00:03:11.174
that's 7/3, times,

00:03:11.174 --> 00:03:12.950
what's 10 to the ninth

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.678
divided by 10 to the eighth power?

00:03:15.678 --> 00:03:17.353
Well that's just going to be 10.

00:03:17.353 --> 00:03:20.580
10 to the ninth is 10
to the eighth times 10,

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.973
and if we divide that by 10 to the eighth,

00:03:21.973 --> 00:03:23.761
we're just gonna be left with 10.

00:03:23.761 --> 00:03:25.292
Or, if we think about exponent properties,

00:03:25.292 --> 00:03:27.318
we have the same base, 10 to the ninth,

00:03:27.318 --> 00:03:29.037
divided by 10 to the eighth,

00:03:29.037 --> 00:03:31.033
you can subtract this, the exponent

00:03:31.033 --> 00:03:31.613
in the denominator,

00:03:31.613 --> 00:03:33.494
from the exponent in the numerator.

00:03:33.494 --> 00:03:36.419
So it's going to be 10 to
the nine minus eight power,

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:37.476
10 to the first.

00:03:37.476 --> 00:03:39.255
This is going to be times 10.

00:03:39.255 --> 00:03:40.417
Well that's not exactly what they have

00:03:40.417 --> 00:03:42.820
over here, but we see 7/3,

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.919
this is 2 1/3 times 10.

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:50.919
So we could say this is
equal to 2 1/3 times 10,

00:03:52.956 --> 00:03:55.059
which is approximately equal to,

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:58.635
which is approximately
equal to two times 10

00:03:58.635 --> 00:03:59.934
if we're just rounding,

00:03:59.934 --> 00:04:02.258
once again, this is all
for the sake of roughness,

00:04:02.258 --> 00:04:04.336
which is 20,

00:04:04.336 --> 00:04:05.540
which is 20,

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.449
which is that right over there.
