00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:06.830
In 2017, scientists launched an ambitious
experiment to photograph a black hole for

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.530
the first time,
A network of radio dishes across four different

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.440
continents joined together to form a giant,
planet-sized observatory, known as the Event

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.609
Horizon Telescope.

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.659
It set its sights on two targets: Sagittarius
A*, the supermassive black hole in the heart

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:27.019
of our Milky Way, and an even bigger one lurking
in Messier 87.

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:32.790
With a globe sized telescope, the EHT should
have enough resolution to directly observe

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.530
the shadow of a black hole’s event horizon.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:43.610
It’s been over a year, so where’s the
photo?

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.490
To get some answers, we went to MIT Haystack
Observatory, one of the two hubs responsible

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.910
for processing all of the observing data.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.510
A lot of people wonder, why haven't you released
an image yet?

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.970
There are three reasons for that.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:04.290
One is that it took a long time for the data
to get here.At each telescope, we record 64

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.460
gigabits per second of data...We record...throughout
the course of a night.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.329
So we're talking about several petabytes of
data.

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:17.070
For the data volumes we're talking about,
the Internet is insufficient to transport

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.070
the data.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.549
nothing beats loading up hard drives onto
an airplane and shipping them.

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.929
And shipping hard drives from telescopes in
Chile and the South Pole to data correlators

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:27.329
just took months.

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:32.539
The second reason is because we're being very
careful on the calibration.

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:38.079
After the data were shipped to Haystack, the
team here...started to correlate the data.

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:42.409
Once the data were correlated, we handed them
off to the calibration and error analysis

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.479
team...to find fringes and figure out the
amplitude calibration.

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.009
For the first time, we had incredibly sensitive
detections on all of our baselines.

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.219
And that means that we could actually start
to see all the little bumps and wiggles that

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:55.560
were instrumental in nature rather than from
the source.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.459
I can show some example here: one of our target,
the Sagittarius A star.

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:07.319
Everything is rotating around 30 minutes,
which is really fast.The Event Horizon Telescope

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:13.070
is designed to actually catch things happening
on very short timescales.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.630
It takes a lot of time to check what's happening.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.290
For example, what's the instrumentation effect?

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.800
What's the actual minor effect, or side effect?

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.310
And the third reason is we're just being extra
careful.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.960
We have internal reviews all the time where
one team goes ahead and works with the data.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.831
And then people who weren't involved in that...can
look at the results and say, "Well did you

00:02:36.831 --> 00:02:37.950
think about this?

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.040
Did you try this?"

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.720
At this stage of the project, the team has
a solid enough data set to start putting together

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.720
images.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.180
The telescope coverage itself...doesn't cover
all of the planet so when we actually want

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.480
to make images, there is an infinite number
of possible images can fit our data set.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.280
We need to find what is the most likely images
for these sources.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.580
It's like a detective work.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.570
We actually have four different teams of people
making images.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.370
And they're working blindly.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.040
So one team makes an image, a second team
makes an image.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.450
And then at the end we compare them and say,
are these consistent?

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.810
But that comes with a whole new set of obstacles.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.110
For our Milky Way black hole, Sagittarius
A star, there are two challenges.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:29.020
What we are expecting to see is the structure,
or the plasma flow around the black hole is

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.640
dynamically changing.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.800
We are supposed to take a movie of these black
holes.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.300
That pose some challenge for the image reconstruction.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.670
Another challenge is that because Sagittarius
A star is at the center of our galaxy...we

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.020
are looking …. through the many spiral arms
of our galaxy.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.780
That will slightly blur the image of Sagittarius
A star.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:59.150
So we also need to mitigate a kind of scattering
effect from the interstellar plasma in front

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.190
of us on the way to Sagittarius A star.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:07.170
If we move on another source, M-87, it also
has a completely different challenge… because

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:13.569
M-87 is not in our galaxy, there are some
uncertainties.

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:18.370
Before we explain what those are, remember
when it comes to imaging a black hole, scientists

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.750
can’t observe it directly.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.600
They’re looking at the surrounding matter
and light that’s being pulled by gravity

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.660
around the black hole’s event horizon.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:35.790
You’ve likely heard that phrase before,
it’s the ultimate boundary, the place where….”

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:46.440
But underneath that classic saying is a geometric
parameter that underpins how the EHT maps

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.000
black holes in space time.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.070
It’s called the Schwarzschild radius.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:57.020
Back in 1916, German astrophysicist Karl Schwarzschild
was inspired by Einstein’s theory of relativity,

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.160
and in his free time fighting as a soldier
in World War I, he came up with this formula

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.950
to calculate the radius: Where M is the mass,
g is the universal

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.590
constant of gravitation, and c is the speed
of light.

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.531
The Schwarzschild radius is the distance from
the center of the black hole to the event

00:05:14.531 --> 00:05:17.720
horizon, that point where light can’t escape.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.130
This model works for non-rotating black holes.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.821
But the field has advanced since Schwarzschild,
with the Kerr metric, which takes black hole

00:05:23.821 --> 00:05:25.500
spin into account.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.670
Ultimately, the Schwarzschild radius is key,
because it helps physicist unlock the size

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.800
of a black hole.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:40.030
Apparent size of the black hole is determined
by distance to M-87 and how far the black

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:46.410
hole is and how heavy the black hole is, because
the size of black hole is proportional to

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:47.550
the mass of the black hole.

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:54.310
We have a very good measurement for the distance,
but still there is a factor of two uncertainties

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.820
for the mass of M-87.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.000
The size of the shadow is determined by the
black hole's mass.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.310
The bigger the mass, the larger the shadow.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.400
But if the mass is a question mark, that could
pose a challenge.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:11.740
If we cannot get the shadow, may be suggesting
that the current way to measure the mass of

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:18.000
the supermassive black hole in many galaxies
could be somewhat wrong and we need to do

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000
recalibration.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.690
While the teams are still working on images,
they have some guesses as to what the finals

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:27.389
might look like. for Sagittarius A star, the
expected image is very different from, for

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:29.900
instance, the famous image of "Interstellar."

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:35.550
We will see it's like a crescent image; one
side is brighter and there is a shadow and

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.410
the other side is very faint.

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:44.740
For M-87, we are expected to see both accretion
flow falling into the black hole and also

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:49.220
the jet, which is the plasma flow escaping
from the black hole.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:54.371
Those images are still preliminary, and they
haven't been released yet, but we expect to

00:06:54.371 --> 00:07:01.030
have a release of the papers and the images
in the late winter or early spring of 2019.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.360
Black holes are basic constituents of our
universe, and these monsters are the anchor

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.230
point in virtually every galaxy.

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:12.040
Understanding their formation and dynamics
could be the ultimate test of Einstein’s

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.020
theory of relativity, which makes some key
predictions.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:20.940
First that the gravity of a black hole curves
space time and draws everything towards it.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:25.210
And secondly that the shadow of the event
horizon cast by the accretion disk should

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:26.700
be mostly circular.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:32.270
Depending on what the final image looks like,
we might need to update the law of the cosmos.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:36.030
Everyone believes something is actually falling
down the black hole and something is escaping

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:39.330
the black hole, but we still don't have any
images.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:43.800
We are now in a very exciting moment that
we can actually test what people thought about

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.370
a hundred years ago.

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:48.500
My take is that Einstein was probably right.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:52.919
Every time we've tried to test relativity,
relativity passes the test.

00:07:52.919 --> 00:07:56.960
the image of the black hole could change our
conception of relativity, or it could confirm

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:57.960
it.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:03.630
So you predict that you will see a circular
shadow, and the size of that shadow is predictable

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:07.620
from the distance to the source and the mass
of the black hole.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.180
We could always get unlucky and not see a
shadow at all.

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:16.300
But I think that the preliminary data tells
us there's something there to be seen.
