00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.290
You're almost ready to get started. The last thing I'd

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.280
like you to do is to read over the rubric, which

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.970
is linked in the instructor notes. You can use this rubric

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.270
to self-assess your work, and to gauge the quality of it.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.060
For students enrolled in the full course experience, this is

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.730
the same rubric that Udacity will use to evaluate your final

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.070
project. I'm excited to see what all of you can do,

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.040
and remember, be curious, be sceptical and have fun exploring data.
