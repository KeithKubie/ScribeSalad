DAVE GOSSARD: The world around us,
both natural and man-made, is in

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.330
constant motion.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.910
Understanding the dynamic behavior of
objects and systems, their motions and

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.850
associated forces, is fundamental
to engineering.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:19.200
The ability to analyze and predict the
dynamic behavior of mechanical systems

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.770
is an important foundation for
design and innovation.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.530
Hi, I'm Dave Gossard, professor of
mechanical engineering at MIT and

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.670
instructor of a new course
on edX, 2.03x, Dynamics.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.850
This course has the same rigor as the
regular MIT course of the same name,

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.230
one of the first subjects in our
mechanical engineering undergraduate

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.080
curriculum.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.050
In this course, you will learn to apply
Newton's laws to systems whose

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.830
complexity is representative
of engineering practice.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.960
You will learn to analyze the kinematics
of mechanisms, understand

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.470
torque and angular momentum, and
imbalance in rotating systems.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.010
You'll learn to derive equations of
motion for nonlinear dynamic systems

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.770
and how to use modern computational
tools to solve them.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.610
After completing this course, you'll
be able to analyze the behavior of

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.360
existing devices you encounter
and predict the behavior of

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.160
new ones you invent.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.530
It'll be fun, accessible,
and empowering.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.640
Come join us in 2.03x and get moving.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:35.840
