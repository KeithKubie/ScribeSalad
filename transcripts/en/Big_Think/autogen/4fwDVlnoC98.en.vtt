along with something very interesting
which is his paintings so in his

which is his paintings so in his
 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.530
which is his paintings so in his
paintings we see intense color and a

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540
paintings we see intense color and a
 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.719
paintings we see intense color and a
difference in terms of paintings that

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729
difference in terms of paintings that
 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.550
difference in terms of paintings that
preceded it which which weren't more

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560
preceded it which which weren't more
 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.070

abstract quality almost in some ways

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510
abstract quality almost in some ways
 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.630
abstract quality almost in some ways
like a nightmarish quality to them and

like a nightmarish quality to them and
 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.009
like a nightmarish quality to them and
that makes you think about again what

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019
that makes you think about again what
 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:11.680
that makes you think about again what
was going on his mind that he produced

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690
was going on his mind that he produced
 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.929

something like that if you look at all

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:13.939
something like that if you look at all
 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:16.330
something like that if you look at all
of those qualities you think about

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340
of those qualities you think about
 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.170
of those qualities you think about
temporal lobe epilepsy

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180
temporal lobe epilepsy
 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.449
temporal lobe epilepsy
temporal lobe epilepsy is not like other

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459
temporal lobe epilepsy is not like other
 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.250
temporal lobe epilepsy is not like other
forms of epilepsy where you have a

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260
forms of epilepsy where you have a
 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.039
forms of epilepsy where you have a
seizure happen that you can see because

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049
seizure happen that you can see because
 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:26.479
seizure happen that you can see because
it's happening in the temporal lobe

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489
it's happening in the temporal lobe
 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.059
it's happening in the temporal lobe
which is an emotional center of the

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069
which is an emotional center of the
 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.670
which is an emotional center of the
brain so that symptoms of temporal lobe

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680
brain so that symptoms of temporal lobe
 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.780
brain so that symptoms of temporal lobe
epilepsy are this mood lability

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790
epilepsy are this mood lability
 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.959

stickiness irritability or a civility
and so being a frustrating person and

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280
and so being a frustrating person and
 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.390
and so being a frustrating person and
visual hallucinations so seeing visually

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400
visual hallucinations so seeing visually
 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.030
visual hallucinations so seeing visually

heightened sensory visual stimuli like
 

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:58.759
heightened sensory visual stimuli like
this essentially starry night or you

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769
this essentially starry night or you
 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.849

else looks like so it can so people have

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:09.689
else looks like so it can so people have
 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:11.119
else looks like so it can so people have
temporal lobe epilepsy might look at

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129
temporal lobe epilepsy might look at
 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.059
temporal lobe epilepsy might look at
your face and see distortions and of

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069
your face and see distortions and of
 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.229
your face and see distortions and of
course when we look at some of Van

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239
course when we look at some of Van
 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.659
course when we look at some of Van
Gogh's paintings you often do see such

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:17.669
Gogh's paintings you often do see such
 

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:19.879

distortions the interesting thing is

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889
distortions the interesting thing is
 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:22.099
distortions the interesting thing is
that ultimately when he was hospitalized

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109
that ultimately when he was hospitalized
 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:26.809
that ultimately when he was hospitalized
in REME the doctor actually thought he

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819
in REME the doctor actually thought he
 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.719
in REME the doctor actually thought he
did have epilepsy and treated him for

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:29.729
did have epilepsy and treated him for
 

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:32.030
did have epilepsy and treated him for
epilepsy so there was even knowledge at

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040
epilepsy so there was even knowledge at
 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.689
epilepsy so there was even knowledge at
that time that there could be this kind

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:35.699
that time that there could be this kind
 

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:38.390
that time that there could be this kind
of illness causing his problems and in

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400
of illness causing his problems and in
 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.969
of illness causing his problems and in
fact this all fits with the time periods

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:40.979
fact this all fits with the time periods
 

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:43.759
fact this all fits with the time periods
during which he becomes most ill which

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769
during which he becomes most ill which
 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.990
during which he becomes most ill which
is when he would drink absinthe absinthe

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000
is when he would drink absinthe absinthe
 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.420
is when he would drink absinthe absinthe
was an alcohol that was very in during

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430
was an alcohol that was very in during
 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.170
was an alcohol that was very in during
various periods of Van Gogh's life and

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180
various periods of Van Gogh's life and

various periods of Van Gogh's life and
it has a very high pure alcohol content

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:57.379
it has a very high pure alcohol content
 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:00.679
it has a very high pure alcohol content
which lowers the seizure threshold in

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:00.689
which lowers the seizure threshold in
 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:03.140
which lowers the seizure threshold in
the brain so people who have epilepsy

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150
the brain so people who have epilepsy
 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.479
the brain so people who have epilepsy
have to stay away from alcohol and are

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489
have to stay away from alcohol and are

usually medicated with something that
 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:08.809
usually medicated with something that
lowers the seizure threshold of the

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819
lowers the seizure threshold of the
 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.499
lowers the seizure threshold of the
brain if one would drink absinthe and

brain if one would drink absinthe and
 

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:14.869
brain if one would drink absinthe and
have a temporal lobe epilepsy you would

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879
have a temporal lobe epilepsy you would
 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:19.430
have a temporal lobe epilepsy you would
expect a real rise in the amount of

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440
expect a real rise in the amount of
 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.580
expect a real rise in the amount of
activity going on and and

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590
activity going on and and
 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.590
activity going on and and
and more illness to the point even of

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600
and more illness to the point even of
 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.930
and more illness to the point even of
being psychotic which did ultimately

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940
being psychotic which did ultimately
 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.200
being psychotic which did ultimately
