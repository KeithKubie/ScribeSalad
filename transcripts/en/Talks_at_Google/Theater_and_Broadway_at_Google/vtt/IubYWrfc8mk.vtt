00:00:05.556 --> 00:00:08.189
SPEAKER: "The Whirligig" is
presented by the New Group,

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.420
in associated with Lisa Matlin.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.073
And everyone, please
help me welcome

00:00:12.073 --> 00:00:13.739
cast and creatives
from "The Whirligig".

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:15.146
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:15.146 --> 00:00:16.854
DOLLY WELLS: [INAUDIBLE]
clap for myself.

00:00:16.854 --> 00:00:19.370
NORBERT LEO BUTZ: You can clap
for yourself, it's all right.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.745
SPEAKER: And so, I guess we
should go down the line here.

00:00:21.745 --> 00:00:24.080
We have Norbert Leo
Butz, of course.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.810
And Dolly Wells, Zosia Mamet.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.230
Hamish already raised his hand,
and then artistic director

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.720
Scott Elliott.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.830
I want to start with the
concept of the show, Hamish.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.420
Where did this even come from?

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.540
[STAMMERING]

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.680
HAMISH LINKLATER: Yes, yes.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.222
I don't know.

00:00:49.222 --> 00:00:50.221
SPEAKER: Take your time.

00:00:50.221 --> 00:00:52.460
HAMISH LINKLATER: I
started writing some scenes

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.840
with some people in it, and had
a really good idea for a play.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.800
And then it fell apart.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.609
And I put those scenes away.

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:04.900
SPEAKER: How long ago was that?

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.400
HAMISH LINKLATER: That
was about four years ago.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.020
And they moldered and festered.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.710
And then I pulled them
out of the drawer.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.770
And I was shooting a movie
in Richmond, Virginia.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.810
I had a lot of time on my hands.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.950
I had too small a part.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:31.550
Then suddenly, this play filled
up the rest of like 10 days

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.330
by the river.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.100
And it came out.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.450
Yeah, that's how I
wrote the play, I think.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.280
SPEAKER: So that's how, but why?

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.710
HAMISH LINKLATER: Why
did I write the play?

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.510
Because I had too much time on
my hands in Richmond, Virginia.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:55.350
No, I think the play is
about loss, to a degree.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.290
And I think I probably
had experienced some loss.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.250
And it was giving me a rash.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.830
And I needed to scratch it.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.539
And so I scratched
it with my pen.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.965
Out of that ooze came the play.

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:13.090
NORBERT LEO BUTZ: Oh, lord.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.156
HAMISH LINKLATER: Yeah,
sometimes the playwright

00:02:16.156 --> 00:02:16.780
should shut up.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.472
SCOTT ELLIOTT: He
writes very well.

00:02:21.472 --> 00:02:22.180
SPEAKER: Oh yeah.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.300
The show, I saw it Friday
night, which I think

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.370
was your second night open.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.907
Incredible.

00:02:27.907 --> 00:02:29.240
I just want you to keep talking.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.460
You're quite interesting
to listen to.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.280
So oftentimes, it takes of
course years of writing.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.250
And you said it
was four years ago

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.380
when you were down shooting
in the wonderful hills

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.490
of Virginia.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.285
And writing development, and we
get the show through workshops,

00:02:46.285 --> 00:02:47.910
and then through
off-Broadway, and then

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.368
to Broadway, and
the whole process.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.330
I know you're not
on Broadway, but--

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.460
SCOTT ELLIOTT: Yet.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.960
SPEAKER: Yet.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.110
What was the process--

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.090
this is still for creatives
here, Scott and Hamish.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.904
How did you finish
up the script?

00:03:01.904 --> 00:03:02.820
What was the timeline?

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.130
How did, Scott, you get
involved, and be like,

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.300
yes, that's what we want?

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.220
SCOTT ELLIOTT: Yeah, well,
I read a lot of plays

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.450
every year, having to
pick a few to produce.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.030
And Hamish's agent
sent us the play.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.380
And I read it.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.710
And I had an experience
while I was reading it.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.430
It was one of those ones
where I found myself laughing,

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.440
and then I couldn't
stop crying at the end.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.400
And so just that
reaction made me say,

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.150
OK, I have to figure
out a way to do this.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.690
It's a very complicated
play, for those of you

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.950
who might come check it
out, just in the logistics

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:47.820
of the whole thing.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.300
And it took me a minute to
figure out how to do it.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.060
And then I just
decided to do it.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.210
It was not a hard one--

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.220
it didn't go through
a million workshops.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.030
We did, I think,
one little workshop.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.060
And only Zosia was
in that workshop.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.340
And Zosia, I think, fell
in love with the play

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.520
just the same time I did.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.270
We had a love affair
together that weekend.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.755
And we decided we were going to
do it together over a year ago.

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.320
It just was you know
one of those plays.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.850
I love stories that are
small and relatable,

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.450
but are about big things.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.310
And that's what this play is.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.440
SPEAKER: You said you
wanted to figure out

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.570
how you were going to do it.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.867
Did you mean physically in
terms of the stage itself?

00:04:41.867 --> 00:04:43.950
Because whirligig-- I mean,
what is the definition

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.260
of a whirligig here?

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.230
HAMISH LINKLATER:
I've forgotten.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.230
SPEAKER: Well, I've got
it right in front of me.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.290
I was setting you up.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.000
It is one, noun, a
toy that spins around,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.290
for example a top or pinwheel.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.050
Two, a thing regarded as
hectic or constantly changing,

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.480
such as a whirligig of time.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.190
So the characters
in this play all

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.790
seem to circulate
around each other.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.331
They've got past lives, and then
their present lives have all

00:05:09.331 --> 00:05:11.850
brought them back, which
is-- the term I coined,

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.070
full circle,
everything comes back.

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.062
But then the stage
itself is also--

00:05:16.062 --> 00:05:16.770
it's a turntable.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:17.275
It's a whirligig.

00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:18.150
SCOTT ELLIOTT: Right.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.210
SPEAKER: So is there--

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.960
When you said how you
were going to do it,

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.410
did you mean in terms of--

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.070
SCOTT ELLIOTT: Well, it
doesn't just have a turntable.

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.827
That was just something
that I envisioned.

00:05:28.827 --> 00:05:29.910
That wasn't in the script.

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.030
But it also has people climbing
trees and things like that,

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.680
which seems almost impossible.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:41.640
And just trying to figure out
a way to do that, artistically,

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:48.060
poetically, and within a budget,
it became very challenging.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.570
But then my set designer
and I, Derek McLane,

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.890
came up with some ways to
do the little tricks in it.

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.410
The play is-- it
sounds depressing

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.625
but it's very, very
fanciful and charming.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.860
I wanted to just get that feel.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:10.140
And the turntable helped
me create some surprises

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.710
in the visual life of the story.

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.360
SPEAKER: It's
interesting, because when

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.700
the audience loads in,
one of the actresses

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:18.870
is already on stage.

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.590
And she's been sitting
there spinning for how long?

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.170
SCOTT ELLIOTT: That's
why she's not here today.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:26.040
She's nauseous.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.890
No.

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:29.760
No, she's a delightful young
actress, Grace Van Patten.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.500
You will hear a lot about
her very soon, I imagine.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.670
No, I just wanted--

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.070
because it's about a girl
who is losing her life.

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.900
And really, as I watched
the play five times

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.230
this week, it seems
that the play--

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:46.780
a young woman is
losing her life,

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:51.860
and that's what sends everybody
into this whirligig of life.

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:57.840
And they emerge grown, I think.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.544
And that's the sort
of moral of the story

00:07:02.544 --> 00:07:03.960
SPEAKER: So Norbert
and Dolly, how

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.150
did you two get attached to it?

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.590
DOLLY WELLS: It was
cast without me.

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.450
And then I very luckily came
in quite close to the opening,

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:14.190
because the person
that had the part

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:15.690
was then not able to do it.

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:20.219
And I read the play, and felt
incredibly excited, but was not

00:07:20.219 --> 00:07:22.510
going to let myself get too
excited, because I thought,

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:25.386
I'm at the end of
a very long list.

00:07:25.386 --> 00:07:26.260
That's what happened.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.420
SCOTT ELLIOTT: And we had
had a drink once before.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.235
DOLLY WELLS: Yeah, definitely.

00:07:29.235 --> 00:07:29.820
HAMISH LINKLATER: And you wanted
to continue the relationship,

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:29.890
right?

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.181
DOLLY WELLS: And I think
that's why you wrote the play.

00:07:33.695 --> 00:07:34.570
Yeah.

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:36.880
Almost as much as you did.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.800
Anyway, what about you, Norbert?

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:43.420
NORBERT LEO BUTZ: I just
met Hamish once or twice.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:49.280
And just to know Hamish is
just to fall in love with him.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.780
And I've been a huge fan
of his work as an actor.

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.729
He is one of my favorite
working actors in New York City.

00:07:56.729 --> 00:07:58.270
I've seen him several
times on stage.

00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:59.500
He's quite brilliant.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:04.330
And so when he sent me an email
with a play attached to it,

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:07.510
I was a little bit--

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:11.110
the actor slash
playwright, there

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:13.180
was a little bit of an eye roll.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:18.490
Maybe a slight eye
roll, like oh god,

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:21.970
here's another
dilettante writer,

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:29.860
and quickly realized
this is a real writer--

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:30.940
a real writer.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:36.250
I couldn't believe-- and I did
so with some major jealousy.

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:38.470
How could someone be
such a good performer

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:40.720
and write so beautifully?

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.440
I fell in love with the
play on first reading.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.400
And Hamish said he had just
had me in mind for the role.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.500
And I just jumped on.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:57.870
I think there's a tradition
of actor playwrights.

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:03.210
And I think Hamish really does,
he joins the Tracy Letts, Bruce

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:15.720
Norris school of contemporary
actors who write, not because--

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.930
I don't know, I could
be wrong-- because they

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:22.020
need to prove that they can do
something else besides acting.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.910
Like I said, he's a real writer.

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:26.120
But the joy of
doing a play by is

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:31.830
someone who is an actor as
well, so much of the word

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:32.820
is already on the page.

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.560
It's very actor-friendly.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.890
It's a play for actors.

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:39.540
It's all about the characters.

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:46.040
It's all about the minds and
hearts of these sort of quiet,

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.660
maybe some would say
insignificant lives.

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:55.100
But I love stories that are
about quiet, insignificant

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.345
lives.

00:09:56.345 --> 00:09:58.070
The play reminded me of--

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:03.192
I like short stories.

00:10:03.192 --> 00:10:05.400
And I've been reading a lot
of Chekhov short stories.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.470
And I have for a
long, long time.

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:10.180
There's something Chekhovian
about these characters.

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:11.720
In fact, there's a
wonderful passage

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.020
that sort of hearkens to "The
Cherry Orchard," that one

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:19.430
character gets to say, "I love
the short stories of Alice

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:24.020
Munro and people like that who
just sort of take Polaroids

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:27.560
of people's lives, that
you would pass by and not

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.100
think twice about
what was going on."

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.370
And I just love that.

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:38.880
We get to be voyeurs into
these simple people who are

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:44.050
dealing with unspeakable loss.

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:45.550
SPEAKER: That was
a very good answer

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:47.585
for a very simple question.

00:10:47.585 --> 00:10:49.210
NORBERT LEO BUTZ:
Oh, give me a minute.

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:51.730
[LAUGHING]

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:53.950
SPEAKER: So then, for all
three of the cast members

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:55.720
here, what was your first
reaction when you actually

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.344
did read the script
for the first time?

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.470
Because it touches on so many
different levels of-- there's

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:06.980
a lot of comedic relief
written into it, but I wonder,

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:10.220
too, Norbert, your character
specifically, how much of that

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:15.470
is you bringing the
comedy to it versus what's

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:16.380
written on the page.

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:17.930
But that's a second question.

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:20.619
Again, my first question is
what was your first impression?

00:11:20.619 --> 00:11:22.160
NORBERT LEO BUTZ:
I was really moved.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.870
I found it incredibly relatable.

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:29.930
I'll just be very candid and
say that the character is

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:34.330
a father of a young girl
between the ages of 17 and 23,

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:34.830
we see her.

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:36.120
I have three daughters myself.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.310
My oldest daughter is 20.

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:38.550
I have a 17-year-old.

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:39.340
I could relate.

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:42.300
I thought it was extremely
authentic, the dialogue,

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.580
very funny.

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:47.690
I don't know how this
approaching-middle-aged man

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:51.990
gets the vernacular of
teenage girlhood so spot-on.

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:55.320
He has two daughters himself.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:58.470
I just recognized immediately,
Hamish has two daughters

00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:59.850
as well.

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:04.470
This guy has just an
open, bleeding heart

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:06.000
full of love for his child.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.860
And that was relatable.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:12.390
He's an actor and an acting
teacher, the character is.

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:14.580
There were some
wonderfully funny scenes

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:17.230
where I get to kind of
send up, a little bit,

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:19.900
the cliche of the
acting teacher,

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:26.010
of the sort of narcissist
acting teacher.

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:28.040
The jokes were really funny.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.942
Hamish also has--

00:12:29.942 --> 00:12:31.650
I'm going to keep on
raving about Hamish,

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:34.882
but I first loved
him on "The New

00:12:34.882 --> 00:12:36.090
Adventures of Old Christine."

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:37.340
You remember him on that show?

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.490
He's so funny.

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:44.190
And But there's proper jokes
in the show, and not jokes

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:46.650
that have punch lines,
but that come out

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:48.310
of the situations
and the characters.

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:51.090
And I really responded to that.

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:53.130
DOLLY WELLS: I found
it incredibly sad.

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:55.620
I remember reading
it with my husband,

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.290
and I couldn't-- there were
scenes neither of us could get

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:00.390
to the end of without crying.

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:03.600
I thought I thought it was very,
very beautiful, very sad, very

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.191
funny.

00:13:04.191 --> 00:13:05.940
I agree with what
Norbert said, that there

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:07.440
were jokes that
were coming out-- it

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.320
all comes out of
such a real place.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.969
And these people are all--

00:13:11.969 --> 00:13:13.510
god, imagine if I
started crying now,

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:14.801
how embarrassing that would be.

00:13:14.801 --> 00:13:15.750
I'm not going to.

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:16.515
[LAUGHING]

00:13:16.515 --> 00:13:18.640
SPEAKER: Look at the picture
on the wall over here.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:24.360
DOLLY WELLS: All the characters
are so brave and sympathetic

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.960
and full of--

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:30.230
I mean, it's the most
awful situation that--

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:32.090
I am also a mother
with two children

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:34.650
and one teenage daughter.

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:36.840
The setting and the
situation is so awful,

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:42.020
but there's such beautiful,
specific moments of joy

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:43.759
and hope and that--

00:13:43.759 --> 00:13:45.050
I hadn't read a play like that.

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:46.591
And also, without
giving things away,

00:13:46.591 --> 00:13:48.755
the time structure I
was just very excited

00:13:48.755 --> 00:13:49.880
about when I first read it.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.467
So I felt-- and this
is the first play

00:13:52.467 --> 00:13:54.050
I've done since I've
come to New York,

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:55.040
and I haven't done
very many before,

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.810
so it felt like,
wow, to be able to do

00:13:56.810 --> 00:14:02.580
this brand-new, exciting,
delicate thing felt just really

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:03.080
exciting.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:08.200
And the part of
Christina is so--

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.550
well, she's a very unhappy--

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:11.800
I don't want to give too
much away, because you're all

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:12.400
going to see it.

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.525
You're all going to bring
lots of people to see it.

00:14:14.525 --> 00:14:19.150
But she doesn't have such a
bleeding heart as her husband

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.260
and her ex-husband.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.449
She finds it much
harder to communicate,

00:14:23.449 --> 00:14:24.740
to work out what she's feeling.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:28.100
She's a bit more withdrawn
and cold and confused.

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.900
So there's a huge amount
of regret for her,

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:33.660
and there's a huge
amount of unspoken--

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:38.010
I'm garrulous, and
I haven't really

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:39.510
played a character
like that before.

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:42.690
And I found that very
exciting, and a challenge.

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:45.530
And the cast, I mean the whole
situation seemed like a dream.

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:47.030
So I didn't want
to get too excited.

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:48.930
But when I read it,
I was gobsmacked.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:52.940
I couldn't stop thinking
about all of them.

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.395
ZOISA MAMET: Such a good word.

00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:57.172
[INAUDIBLE]

00:14:57.172 --> 00:14:58.380
He just told me you're fired.

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:03.608
DOLLY WELLS: I thought I'd be
told at the end of previews,

00:15:03.608 --> 00:15:06.066
but I didn't know it would be
in front of everyone, but OK.

00:15:06.066 --> 00:15:07.890
It's fine.

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:10.830
ZOISA MAMET: I echo
everything that they said.

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:18.130
And I am a big believer that
true and great comedy arises

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:21.160
out of necessity.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:25.000
We laugh in the darkest
moments, because we have to.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.030
Otherwise we implode and die.

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:29.830
It's why people
laugh at funerals,

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:32.790
or when something
terrible happens,

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:34.390
you somehow get the giggles.

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:35.890
And it feels so
inappropriate, but I

00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:39.160
think it's sort of your
body's reaction to attempting

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:43.120
to process something that's
impossible to process

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.720
in real time.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.110
And when I read
Hamish's play, it's

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:51.130
so heartbreaking in the most
beautiful and, like Dolly said,

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:52.190
delicate way.

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:56.980
But it's also so fucking
funny, because it has to be.

00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:01.417
Because if it wasn't,
these people would die.

00:16:01.417 --> 00:16:03.500
They'd kill themselves,
because there is no reason

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.190
to go on living otherwise.

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:09.320
And I think these
very hard humans

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:15.560
who are faced with this
incredible tragedy and the need

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:22.530
to process their own guilt
and blame surrounding it--

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:25.370
Hamish has just does this
incredible and beautiful job

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:29.930
of writing the way that
they navigate this story,

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:33.290
and the way that
they navigate trying

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:38.430
to climb over their grief
and continue living.

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:42.030
SPEAKER: Is this all
new for you, Hamish?

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:44.480
HAMISH LINKLATER:
It's very accurate.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.814
I can't imagine the play you
guys all must be imagining.

00:16:47.814 --> 00:16:49.634
[LAUGHING]

00:16:49.634 --> 00:16:50.800
SPEAKER: Sorry to interrupt.

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:51.360
Go ahead.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.200
ZOISA MAMET: We're really just
setting it up for all of us

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.110
to fail here really--

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:56.150
SPEAKER: Because I'm
here looking at Scott

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:57.410
with this weird
look on his face.

00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:58.550
I was like, is
this the first time

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:00.436
he's heard any of you
guys talk about him?

00:17:00.436 --> 00:17:01.150
DOLLY WELLS: No.

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:03.452
ZOISA MAMET: Those are
just the faces he makes.

00:17:03.452 --> 00:17:04.910
NORBERT LEO BUTZ:
And I just wanted

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:06.290
to say one other thing too.

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:08.599
Something about the play
that struck me right away

00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:12.069
is its total lack of cynicism.

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:17.359
I don't know about
all of you, but it was

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:22.880
a hard year in a lot of ways.

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:26.390
For a lot of us it felt like
the bottom really fell out.

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:32.440
We were culturally, socially,
in a whirligig, I think,

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:33.450
in a lot of ways.

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:36.110
And so this idea that
a group of people

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:42.620
come together to hold
each other up, I suppose--

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:47.010
it's a play about community,
really at the end of the day.

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:51.110
It's about eight characters
who get through something

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:54.420
through and with each other.

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:56.760
We all need each
other up on the stage.

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.610
And we need each other
without cynicism.

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:01.490
That hit me real hard
when I read the play.

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:03.650
Maybe it was at the time
that I got the play.

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:08.530
But that's what I most
love about "The Whirligig."

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:11.240
SPEAKER: So all of
the actors, Scott,

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:15.320
have very long and illustrious--
and even the writer--

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:21.050
acting careers in front of
the camera for TV and movies.

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:23.360
Is there anything
that-- as a director,

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:26.851
do you have to adjust what you
do based on what they bring,

00:18:26.851 --> 00:18:28.850
because they have a
different background, versus

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:30.680
a traditional theater-only
type of actor?

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:31.680
Or does that even exist?

00:18:34.452 --> 00:18:35.660
Or you just say, "Have at it!

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:38.180
Here's the word."

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:41.570
HAMISH LINKLATER: Every
one is its own animal.

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:44.690
When you get a group of people
together, and you try to--

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:47.930
I personally try to make
it seem like everybody's

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:49.470
in the same world.

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:55.600
And so sometimes you have
to nudge somebody in one way

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.340
or in another way
to sort of make sure

00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:01.790
that everybody feels like
they live in the same world.

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:03.530
Because that's, in
my opinion, when

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:06.050
you watch a show or
a movie or something

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:10.490
like that, if it's off balance,
it doesn't seem authentic.

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:12.080
It seems a little fraudulent.

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:17.210
And so I really work hard
thinking about a world.

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:18.530
And every world is different.

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:21.970
Sometimes you do a
very different tone.

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:25.760
It's really just about the
sort of tone that you're after.

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.490
And as far as people being--

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:31.891
I mean talent is talent
and technique is technique,

00:19:31.891 --> 00:19:32.390
I guess.

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:34.940
And so some people who
are incredibly talented

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.950
have to figure out
things in their technique

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:39.650
to help them out.

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:42.500
And so you just try to help
people figure out the balance.

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.930
And sometimes you hit them.

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:47.660
But it's always with love.

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:53.330
That's always my goal.

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:57.040
Whether a show works or not
for me, is when I watch it,

00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:59.090
I feel like, ah,
it feels like I'm

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:04.596
watching a world where everybody
inhabiting it is the same one.

00:20:04.596 --> 00:20:06.470
SPEAKER: And the person
I went to see it with

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:08.150
commented afterwards
she said to me,

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:09.691
"I felt like I just
watched a movie."

00:20:11.937 --> 00:20:13.520
And I was thinking
about that comment.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:14.900
I was thinking about the
whole thing over the weekend,

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.590
because I saw it
on Friday night.

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:18.920
And it sat with me for
a couple of reasons.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.620
Being a parent myself,
it hit me on that level.

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:24.380
But then just in terms of
just being damn good theater,

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:26.660
it was on that level.

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:29.190
And then my friend's
comment about being a movie,

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:30.776
it just occurred
to me why we felt

00:20:30.776 --> 00:20:32.900
that based on what you
said, is that everything was

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:36.150
so perfectly complementary
of each other,

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:39.620
including the actors were
all on the same level,

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:42.740
the set was not intrusive,
but complemented

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:45.019
everybody's performance.

00:20:45.019 --> 00:20:46.560
So there's actually
no question here.

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.400
I just wanted to add on--

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:52.190
SCOTT ELLIOTT:
But the story sort

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:56.600
of unfolds in a
cinematic way, in that--

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:59.840
not a lot of playwrights
write three-line scenes.

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:03.347
And I think that that was
a challenge, in a way,

00:21:03.347 --> 00:21:03.930
to sort of do.

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:08.310
But I knew that they were
essential to capture the sort

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:12.090
of absurdity of the situation.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.070
And there's no blackouts.

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:20.220
I decided to not have
any blackouts in it,

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:21.870
and try to figure it out.

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:23.880
It took-- I think
the actors wanted

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.430
to kill me-- it
took a while, but I

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:29.310
think now it all worked out.

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:31.500
SPEAKER: Oh, no,
it was wonderful.

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:34.964
Along those lines,
with no blackouts--

00:21:34.964 --> 00:21:36.880
hello, audience, I will
tell you was going on.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.180
The stage turns, so
you're looking at a scene,

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.590
and then that
scene moves upstage

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:43.020
while another scene
comes downstage,

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:45.990
or someone sitting
in a tree, like Zoisa

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:48.515
sits in a tree for what
seems like an hour.

00:21:48.515 --> 00:21:49.390
ZOISA MAMET: Forever.

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:50.730
SPEAKER: Yeah, 20 minutes?

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:53.100
And the tree limb
itself lifts up,

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:56.400
so you're a good 30, 40 feet
off the stage at some point.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.350
ZOISA MAMET: 25.

00:21:58.350 --> 00:21:59.520
SPEAKER: Like 60, 70 feet.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.780
SCOTT ELLIOTT: 25, but she's
stoned, so add another 20.

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:05.270
SPEAKER: Fake stoned, remember?

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:06.750
Fake stoned, like fake news.

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:13.040
What do you guys do when
you're waiting to come back on?

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:16.740
Is there anything you have
to do to just not fall off

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:17.760
that branch?

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:18.240
ZOISA MAMET: In the tree?

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:18.720
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:19.845
ZOISA MAMET: What do we do?

00:22:19.845 --> 00:22:22.080
We stare at the audience.

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:25.850
Yeah, Johnny and I
just people watch.

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:29.670
Because we can't say anything,
because we don't want to pull

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:32.280
focus from the scenes
below us, but we just

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:33.510
watch people in the audience.

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:35.510
SPEAKER: Have you ever
noticed anything unusual?

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:37.380
You're like, that
guy's picking his nose.

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:39.630
ZOISA MAMET: No one's done
anything super embarrassing

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:41.120
yet, but there's still time.

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:42.060
DOLLY WELLS: She
tells us there's

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:43.225
people in the
audience that aren't

00:22:43.225 --> 00:22:44.430
there just to terrify us.

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:45.850
ZOISA MAMET: Oh, yeah.

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:50.250
The other night it
was Stephen Spielberg.

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:53.120
Last night it was Judith Light.

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.870
NORBERT LEO BUTZ:
Terrifying Judith Light.

00:22:57.442 --> 00:22:59.650
ZOISA MAMET: I actually
thought I saw her last night.

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.530
SCOTT ELLIOTT: They're supposed
to be looking in somebody's

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:02.446
window the whole time.

00:23:02.446 --> 00:23:03.360
Now I know.

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.220
So we found out what
really is going on.

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:06.761
SPEAKER: Is your
character motivation

00:23:06.761 --> 00:23:08.415
to find Judith Light?

00:23:08.415 --> 00:23:09.210
Yes.

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:10.102
I get that.

00:23:10.102 --> 00:23:10.544
SCOTT ELLIOTT: Where in
the world is Judith Light?

00:23:10.544 --> 00:23:11.877
SPEAKER: That would be a funny--

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:16.980
in terms of the
audience itself, though.

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:19.710
You've only been open
for a couple of days now,

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:22.230
but have you received any
unusual audience feedback,

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:25.240
or things that you may or may
not have expected from this?

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.200
Any of you?

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:29.640
DOLLY WELLS: I wasn't
ready for him the volume

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.500
of the talking in the audience.

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:35.515
Like in the matinee, I just
had someone go "Oh, my god."

00:23:35.515 --> 00:23:37.530
But they were sitting,
there were so close.

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:39.935
And then you hear, "Is
that the one from--"

00:23:39.935 --> 00:23:41.560
They're trying to
work out who you are.

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:44.447
Or the chatting, I
wasn't so prepared for.

00:23:44.447 --> 00:23:45.030
Just hearing--

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:46.844
SPEAKER: You mean just
poor etiquette of--

00:23:46.844 --> 00:23:48.760
DOLLY WELLS: Yeah, just
talking to each other.

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.330
ZOISA MAMET: That's just
because we're terrible Americans

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:52.897
with no manners.

00:23:52.897 --> 00:23:53.980
And you're not used to it.

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:54.870
DOLLY WELLS: I
remember the first time

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:56.110
I came to the
theater in America,

00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:58.318
and I was so surprised, and
that hasn't happened yet,

00:23:58.318 --> 00:23:59.550
which is devastating--

00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:02.550
is that someone came on stage,
and everyone went, "Woo!"

00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:04.160
Which does not happen in London.

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.250
And it was Orlando Bloom
in "Romeo and Juliet."

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:08.916
And he didn't have his shirt on,
and people were just screaming,

00:24:08.916 --> 00:24:09.540
so I'm--

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:11.370
NORBERT LEO BUTZ:
I was one of them.

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:13.920
DOLLY WELLS: I'm devastated
that I haven't even got--

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.490
NORBERT LEO BUTZ: It was
Orlando Bloom, come on.

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:17.000
DOLLY WELLS: That's true, OK.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:17.230
NORBERT LEO BUTZ:
Without his shirt on.

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:18.600
ZOISA MAMET: Come out without
your shirt on, they might--

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:19.787
DOLLY WELLS: They might cry.

00:24:19.787 --> 00:24:22.469
[LAUGHING]

00:24:22.469 --> 00:24:23.940
Maybe I'll try
that one tomorrow.

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.606
SCOTT ELLIOTT: I'm
fascinated sometimes,

00:24:25.606 --> 00:24:29.100
because when we do
shows-- and I always

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:30.570
know they're working
in a weird way

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:32.970
when sometimes the
audience talks at it.

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:37.950
Or I always love in the
show, when about that key--

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:39.710
you know what I mean?

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:41.430
You won't understand
this, but they

00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:43.080
say, oh, he's locked the door.

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:46.110
They sort of say the line with,
him as if they're so into it

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:48.082
that they recite it with him.

00:24:48.082 --> 00:24:48.915
It's so interesting.

00:24:48.915 --> 00:24:51.596
DOLLY WELLS: And there's
another scene I won't give away

00:24:51.596 --> 00:24:52.900
between Norbert and another--

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.420
SCOTT ELLIOTT: They won't
really remember the scenes

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:55.110
even if you give it away.

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:56.020
DOLLY WELLS: And you
hear the audience go--

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:56.950
[SURPRISED GASP]

00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:57.450
Which I love, every time.

00:24:57.450 --> 00:24:58.590
SCOTT ELLIOTT: Yeah,
there's a lot of gasping.

00:24:58.590 --> 00:24:59.280
And it's interesting.

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:00.300
DOLLY WELLS: They gasp.

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:01.650
SCOTT ELLIOTT: I think that
means people are with it,

00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:03.750
and I find that exciting,
because that's part of--

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:05.666
NORBERT LEO BUTZ: Either
that or my overacting

00:25:05.666 --> 00:25:06.874
offended them so much.

00:25:06.874 --> 00:25:07.540
They were like--

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:08.206
[SURPRISED GASP]

00:25:08.206 --> 00:25:09.690
I can't believe
he did that again!

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:11.398
SCOTT ELLIOTT: You
could feel that people

00:25:11.398 --> 00:25:12.720
are engrossed when they react.

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.520
It's like they have
a visceral reaction.

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.590
They can't control themselves.

00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:18.010
They have to say something.

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:19.170
It's interesting, I think.

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:20.070
And part of the--

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:23.010
I always say the audience
is the next character.

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:25.550
It's like a character
in a play, an audience.

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:27.650
You never you're going
to get any night.

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:31.032
SPEAKER: Just talking,
Norbert, to your over-acting.

00:25:31.032 --> 00:25:32.573
NORBERT LEO BUTZ:
Oh, [INAUDIBLE], it

00:25:32.573 --> 00:25:35.400
gets its own subject heading?

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.566
SPEAKER: On my tablet, I
have overacting right here.

00:25:37.566 --> 00:25:39.690
No, obviously It's working well.

00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:42.442
You've won a couple
Tony awards and such.

00:25:42.442 --> 00:25:43.692
DOLLY WELLS: Your overacting--

00:25:43.692 --> 00:25:45.014
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:45.014 --> 00:25:45.930
NORBERT LEO BUTZ: Wow.

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:47.471
DOLLY WELLS: You so
walked into that.

00:25:47.471 --> 00:25:48.492
You asked for it.

00:25:48.492 --> 00:25:49.950
SPEAKER: This is
a question for you

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:53.160
and, I guess, Hamish
and Scott, too.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:57.934
Your character is
a very eccentric.

00:25:57.934 --> 00:26:00.100
That was my earlier question
that we didn't answer--

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:03.010
how much of that did you bring
to the page, and how much of it

00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:05.570
was written in the
script already?

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:07.570
NORBERT LEO BUTZ: Well,
that's the strange thing

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:08.870
about what we do.

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:17.590
There's a silent amalgamation,
something that happens.

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:19.120
That's what you look for.

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:23.980
I don't know how to answer that
other than to say of course

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:26.290
it's all coming from the page.

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:29.110
It has to start with the words.

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:32.060
I haven't improved anything.

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:32.950
I've added nothing.

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:35.940
The play is so well-written.

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:39.460
So I haven't added
anything to it.

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:41.870
The language is there.

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:45.310
So anything that I'm
doing, my imagination

00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:49.900
has been sparked from what's
right there on the page.

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:58.220
It's my job to sort of
find within me, Norbert,

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:03.460
my sensibility of
Michael, this man.

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:09.480
You I really try not
to over-think it.

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:11.620
You learn it
really, really well.

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:15.610
You learn it perfectly,
as best you can.

00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:17.470
Hamish is a real
stickler about--

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:20.980
"There's actually not
an and in that sentence,

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:23.950
there's actually--"
And he's dead right.

00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:26.110
Every time, he's dead right.

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:28.600
There's a reason that
the and is not there.

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:31.150
The line is funnier without it.

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:34.060
Or it's odder without it.

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:37.720
You try to do exactly
what's on the page,

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:44.200
and then let go and try to fly.

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:51.130
HAMISH LINKLATER: I will say
that I so enjoy acting myself.

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:53.470
And I love being an actor.

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:56.620
And I love other actors so much.

00:27:56.620 --> 00:28:02.350
And so if I'm going to force
someone to go up on a stage

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:04.510
and say something
that I've written,

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:07.980
I hope it will give
them joy to do it,

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:13.000
and joy to the
audience to receive it.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.020
I do tend to write
bigger characters who

00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:19.300
have large emotional lives.

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:23.230
And when I go on stage, I
want to make people laugh,

00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:25.120
and I want to make people cry.

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.610
So I wouldn't want to just--

00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:30.280
what does that, play it forward,
pay it forward, whatever?

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:30.850
ZOISA MAMET: Pay
it forward, yeah.

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:31.510
HAMISH LINKLATER:
Pay for forward.

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:33.221
Yeah, I did know
what I was saying.

00:28:33.221 --> 00:28:33.720
Damn it.

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:41.920
Certainly while putting
together this cast,

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:44.800
the consideration
was, we want people

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:48.490
who are going to eat
up the stage, that

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:50.830
are going to go for it.

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:52.935
Because then,
everyone in the house

00:28:52.935 --> 00:28:55.060
is going to be having a
good time at the same time.

00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:03.700
Norbert is doing it.

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:05.050
And so it's really great.

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:06.220
And Zosia as well.

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:08.122
And Dolly, really, too.

00:29:08.122 --> 00:29:09.580
SPEAKER: Except
you just fired her.

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:13.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:14.830
So from your perspective, Scott.

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:16.097
Is there anything that--

00:29:16.097 --> 00:29:18.430
are you just there to be like,
yep, check all the boxes.

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:19.544
Or, you're a director.

00:29:19.544 --> 00:29:21.460
How much do you direct
these wonderful people?

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:26.620
SCOTT ELLIOTT: I don't know.

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:30.040
I don't know how
other people do it.

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:32.350
I guess I always speak my mind.

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:33.550
I'm honest.

00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:40.330
I try to offer help and insight,
and try not to hover too much,

00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:43.270
let people have a little leeway.

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:45.790
But I also try to be
really honest, because I

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:47.770
want everybody to excel.

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:52.690
I want everybody in the theater
to feel every performance.

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:58.060
Also, I'm dedicated to the
play and Hamish, and so--

00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:02.620
HAMISH LINKLATER: Scott
does an unbelievable job

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:08.620
of changing my diapers,
and soothing me.

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:09.820
It's unbelievable.

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:14.800
During the show, I'm just
like a wiggly, wiggly baby.

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:23.200
But the way that he has
mentored me and cared

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:26.770
for me during this
process, has just

00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:29.230
been unspeakably invaluable.

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:30.820
I'm so grateful to him.

00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:33.490
SPEAKER: So audience, if
you guys have any questions,

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:34.790
we have two mics in the aisles.

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:36.070
Please start to line up.

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:39.590
You can ask anybody anything.

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:42.190
I want to go back, though,
to the set real fast.

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:44.770
I think it's kind of interesting
that, for these shows

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:47.680
that have such a highly evolved
technical aspect, not that this

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:49.540
is [INAUDIBLE]
technical, but you're

00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:51.369
very reliant on a turntable.

00:30:51.369 --> 00:30:52.660
Do you have a contingency plan?

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:55.030
Like, what if that turntable
messes up, screws up?

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:55.960
Has it screwed up?

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:56.380
HAMISH LINKLATER: Do we?

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:57.172
Do we, Scott?

00:30:57.172 --> 00:30:59.159
ZOISA MAMET: Don't
ask that question.

00:30:59.159 --> 00:30:59.950
SPEAKER: Is there--

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:02.050
HAMISH LINKLATER:
[INAUDIBLE] wood in here?

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:04.040
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:06.340
SCOTT ELLIOTT: We have
very experienced people

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:09.980
working on all of the
aspects of the production.

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:15.580
And yeah, it does rely on
it, but if, god forbid,

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:19.300
something happened, they
would still do the play.

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:21.460
The stage is actually--
it's interesting,

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:22.780
the stage is raked.

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:25.090
So you can see behind--

00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:26.827
you can see what's going on.

00:31:26.827 --> 00:31:28.660
So I don't think, if
they just did the play,

00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:30.330
it would just be wonderful.

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:33.820
You just wouldn't see my
staging, which is really

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:35.745
just enhancing the play.

00:31:35.745 --> 00:31:36.370
SPEAKER: Right.

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:36.850
Raked means angled.

00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:38.470
SCOTT ELLIOTT: The
play is amazing,

00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:42.190
so the staging just gives
it a little something.

00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:45.050
But when we did a
workshop of the play,

00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:47.170
and we were all just
sitting around the table

00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:49.030
and reading the play,
it was obvious to us

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:54.090
that just the actual
play is so beautiful.

00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:58.130
So I guess if something
happens, thanks a lot.

00:31:58.130 --> 00:31:58.880
SPEAKER: Blame me.

00:31:58.880 --> 00:31:59.910
SCOTT ELLIOTT: I'm
going to call you.

00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:00.620
SPEAKER: Just blame me, text me.

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:02.703
SCOTT ELLIOTT: I am going
to come and wake you up,

00:32:02.703 --> 00:32:04.710
and your child.

00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:07.120
SPEAKER: That's just mean.

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:10.280
They're young, let them sleep.

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:13.110
Zosia, everybody on
the stage, actually,

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:14.502
and we'll get all of you.

00:32:14.502 --> 00:32:16.800
Zosia, you've got a
long family history

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.840
of being in performing
arts and whatnot.

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:21.960
Your father-- yes,
that shouldn't

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:26.640
be a surprise, your father David
Mamet founded Atlantic Theater

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:29.970
Company here, attached
to this building.

00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:31.900
So you've never
been inside Google,

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:34.358
but you've been in the building,
you said, plenty of times.

00:32:36.734 --> 00:32:38.650
Does your relationship
with him, do you think,

00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:40.140
this is sort of on a
more general note--

00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:41.723
has your relationship
with your father

00:32:41.723 --> 00:32:43.450
being successful
as he is influenced

00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:47.854
the choices that you've made
as your own independent career?

00:32:47.854 --> 00:32:48.520
ZOISA MAMET: No.

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:52.910
SPEAKER: Fair.

00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:53.410
Fair.

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:56.050
All right, next question.

00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:57.340
Norbert!

00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:58.644
Seven of 11 children.

00:32:58.644 --> 00:32:59.560
NORBERT LEO BUTZ: Yep.

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:02.470
SPEAKER: Are any of them
as wonderful over-actors

00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:03.782
as you are?

00:33:03.782 --> 00:33:06.550
NORBERT LEO BUTZ: [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:08.140
SPEAKER: Where did
you get your start?

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:10.875
Is it a family thing?

00:33:10.875 --> 00:33:12.750
NORBERT LEO BUTZ: Yes,
I'm the seventh of 11.

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:15.940
I think I got my
start just trying

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:19.990
to be heard over the
din of that household,

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:24.040
gave me the instrument
that you hear before you.

00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:29.920
I grew up in a suburb
of St. Louis, Missouri.

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.820
And then after age seven,
way out in the country

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:35.230
in a very, very,
very small town.

00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:37.834
No theater at all to speak of.

00:33:37.834 --> 00:33:39.250
My parents were
devout Christians,

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:44.931
so limited music, limited film.

00:33:44.931 --> 00:33:46.930
And that was a great way
to be raised, actually,

00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:49.630
because we just got to
pretend all day long.

00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:52.210
I had to create all kinds
of worlds in my head.

00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:55.120
And we sang a lot, so music
was really my first way

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:58.960
into this crazy world of show.

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:03.970
But then I discovered the
theater in high school.

00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:06.850
Then I went on to college
and studied acting,

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:10.830
and I've been at it ever since.

00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:12.010
SPEAKER: Cool, Dolly.

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:14.560
You're next, yes.

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.929
NORBERT LEO BUTZ: Dolly, by
the way, is my mom's name.

00:34:16.929 --> 00:34:19.917
And now I'm working
with Dolly Wells.

00:34:19.917 --> 00:34:21.250
DOLLY WELLS: I'm called Dorothy.

00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:22.199
NORBERT LEO BUTZ: Yes, and
you don't look anything

00:34:22.199 --> 00:34:23.053
like my mom.

00:34:23.053 --> 00:34:23.969
DOLLY WELLS: Do I not?

00:34:23.969 --> 00:34:25.300
NORBERT LEO BUTZ: No, no.

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:26.159
DOLLY WELLS: OK.

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:28.104
NORBERT LEO BUTZ: You're
sweet like my mom.

00:34:28.104 --> 00:34:30.270
I just didn't want to say
that when Dolly and I have

00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:32.233
to kiss in the play
a lot, so I don't

00:34:32.233 --> 00:34:34.399
think of my mom-- never
mind, this is getting weird.

00:34:34.399 --> 00:34:35.572
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:35.572 --> 00:34:37.280
SPEAKER: Keep going,
this is interesting.

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:37.949
DOLLY WELLS: Here we go.

00:34:37.949 --> 00:34:39.110
NORBERT LEO BUTZ: You
take the mic away from me.

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:39.954
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:34:39.954 --> 00:34:42.042
Doll, your father, John
Wells, correct, yes?

00:34:42.042 --> 00:34:42.750
DOLLY WELLS: Yes.

00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:44.948
SPEAKER: Very, very
successful in his own right.

00:34:44.948 --> 00:34:46.739
DOLLY WELLS: He would
love you saying that.

00:34:46.739 --> 00:34:50.027
He's not alive anymore,
but he was very wonderful.

00:34:50.027 --> 00:34:51.610
He wasn't very, very,
very successful,

00:34:51.610 --> 00:34:54.150
but he was a satirist
and a comedian.

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:56.940
He started up a magazine
called "Private Eye"

00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:00.870
that lampoons most people.

00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:03.660
And he was an actor.

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:05.976
He translated operas,
and he was a journalist.

00:35:05.976 --> 00:35:07.350
He did millions
of things, and he

00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:08.880
thought, towards
the end of his life,

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:09.900
that he did them very badly.

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:11.816
He thought he should
have just done one thing.

00:35:11.816 --> 00:35:13.290
He started off as
a teacher Eton.

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:15.270
He taught French and German.

00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:18.780
And at night, he would
climb out the window

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:22.590
and go to The Establishment,
which was this trendy comedy

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:25.050
place that Peter Cook, this
comedian, would put nights on.

00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:26.460
And my dad would do it with him.

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:28.380
And one night it was
in one of the red tops,

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:30.020
on the bad newspapers.

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:34.320
It said "Eton master peddles
smut on the London stage."

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:36.240
He got asked to come
and see the headmaster.

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:37.615
And they said,
you have to decide

00:35:37.615 --> 00:35:40.680
whether you would like to be
a teacher or peddling smut.

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:42.645
And he decided to peddle smut.

00:35:42.645 --> 00:35:44.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:46.770
For the end of his
life, he thought

00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:50.840
he should have carried on,
stuck to being a teacher.

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:53.310
SPEAKER: And did that influence
you to choose a career--

00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:55.310
DOLLY WELLS: Yes, because
when I was very young,

00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:57.350
his thing that he did
that was most noticed

00:35:57.350 --> 00:36:00.864
was he imitated Mrs. Thatcher's
husband, Denis Thatcher,

00:36:00.864 --> 00:36:01.530
in the West End.

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:02.940
He wrote a play that he put on.

00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:04.530
And It lasted for two years.

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:07.500
And every night, he
would make up whatever

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:09.210
was going on in the news.

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:10.909
And so I would go
and watch him do it.

00:36:10.909 --> 00:36:13.200
And I can remember standing
on the stage at about eight

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:16.566
or nine, just thinking,
this would be really fun.

00:36:16.566 --> 00:36:18.690
And then at night, all his
friends would come home.

00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:20.580
And I was noticing
that yesterday.

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:22.140
I've got a son who's 12.

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:25.470
And we were doing FaceTiming
and doing dares in the theater.

00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:28.410
And anything that he asked
Zosia to do or Hamish to do

00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:30.480
or the crew to do,
they were doing.

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.770
And I was thinking,
there's no way-- help.

00:36:32.770 --> 00:36:34.853
There is no way he's not
going to be an actor now,

00:36:34.853 --> 00:36:36.830
because actors are just
so nice to children.

00:36:36.830 --> 00:36:39.090
ZOISA MAMET: We were
having so much fun.

00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:41.100
They were great-- this
was like 15 minutes

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:44.470
before we went
onstage, by the way.

00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:47.100
DOLLY WELLS: So yes, he did
influence me, definitely.

00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:49.407
SPEAKER: And then Hamish,
your mother, who's

00:36:49.407 --> 00:36:50.490
here in the audience, yes?

00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:52.762
HAMISH LINKLATER:
My mom in the house.

00:36:52.762 --> 00:36:53.654
There she is.

00:36:53.654 --> 00:36:54.874
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:54.874 --> 00:36:56.040
SPEAKER: Who is your mother?

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.120
Tell us about her.

00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:00.210
HAMISH LINKLATER: My mom's a
lady named Kristin Linklater.

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:04.050
She has a technique called
the Linklater technique, which

00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:06.480
is taught in universities
across this country,

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:13.960
to help actors fill a space,
and also be great artists.

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:18.600
And so that's what
smut she peddle.

00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:27.700
And when my mommy had me--

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:29.910
I'm going to tell
a long story now.

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:34.980
When my mommy had me,
just because she's here,

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:38.380
she had a good
university job at NYU.

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:44.790
She was in a good
financial place

00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:49.640
to raise a child by
herself in New York.

00:37:52.524 --> 00:37:54.690
When I got to be about two,
she was like, all right,

00:37:54.690 --> 00:37:55.800
that's enough of that.

00:37:55.800 --> 00:38:00.950
And she went off to start
this theater company called

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:02.700
Shakespeare and Company
in the Berkshires,

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:04.470
where this play is set.

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:08.940
And we moved into
an actor commune,

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:12.990
moved into this abandoned
mansion that was haunted.

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:17.160
It had maybe electricity,
but certainly not hot water.

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:19.080
It was built by Edith Wharton.

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:25.290
And so her ghosts, there
were real, real ghosts.

00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:26.490
NORBERT LEO BUTZ: Yes!

00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:27.990
HAMISH LINKLATER:
And you would hear

00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:30.900
the footsteps of the maids
on the top floor at night,

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:33.134
and then sometimes a scream
and something like that.

00:38:33.134 --> 00:38:34.800
ZOISA MAMET: Hamish,
where is this play?

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:38.320
HAMISH LINKLATER:
This is this play.

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.930
And I'm finally casting
myself in a role.

00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:47.850
There was no money.

00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:50.890
There were just ghosts.

00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:56.760
But the idea was, we're going
to make a great American

00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:57.860
Shakespeare troupe.

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:05.040
That's what I grew up with,
was sitting out on the lawn

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:07.500
and watching the Shakespeare
happening all summer.

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:14.550
And like you were saying,
actors are the best people

00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:16.240
in the world.

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:18.620
Not a lot of people know that.

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:23.040
But when you're a kid,
they want an audience.

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:25.320
They're desperate for an
audience, those actors.

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:28.800
And little children love to
see people dancing around doing

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:30.030
things in pumpkin pants.

00:39:34.290 --> 00:39:35.430
My mom made me--

00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:38.550
[LAUGHING]

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:47.680
My mom made me a home,
and it was in the theater.

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:50.072
So I'm really grateful to her.

00:39:50.072 --> 00:39:51.548
[CRYING]

00:39:51.548 --> 00:39:54.500
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:02.300
SPEAKER: Is that the first
tear shed in a Google talk?

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:05.840
I think it might be, actually.

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:07.070
That was really-- thank you.

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:07.861
Thank you for that.

00:40:07.861 --> 00:40:08.720
And thank you for--

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:10.178
KRISTIN LINKLATER:
We do cry a lot.

00:40:10.178 --> 00:40:11.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:14.690
SPEAKER: The two of
you sit around and cry?

00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:16.184
Everyone needs a
good cry session.

00:40:16.184 --> 00:40:17.100
Just go see this show.

00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:17.990
It's wonderful.

00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:19.490
HAMISH LINKLATER:
Actually, that was

00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:22.802
the one comment I got from
an audience member after it.

00:40:22.802 --> 00:40:24.679
He was like, hey, did
you write the show?

00:40:24.679 --> 00:40:25.970
It was at the end of the thing.

00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:26.750
"Hey, did you write the show?"

00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:27.860
I was like, yeah
I wrote the show.

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:28.960
He was like, "Are you crying?"

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.168
I was like, yeah, I'm crying.

00:40:30.168 --> 00:40:33.410
"You're crying at
your own play?"

00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:36.685
I said to him, "Why the fuck
do you think I wrote it?"

00:40:41.217 --> 00:40:43.470
I like a cry.

00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:46.910
And it's so great when we
have like two show days,

00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:48.160
I get two cries in.

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.057
It's fabulous.

00:40:49.057 --> 00:40:50.640
SPEAKER: So you still
go see the show.

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:52.556
Are you going to see
every show, do you think?

00:40:52.556 --> 00:40:56.020
HAMISH LINKLATER: I go as
often as I possibly can.

00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:58.660
Also, the audience teaches
you so much about the play.

00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:02.417
So it's wonderful to get a
good variety of focus groups.

00:41:02.417 --> 00:41:04.250
SPEAKER: It's very heavy
for the characters.

00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:06.124
All the characters are
deeply, deeply flawed,

00:41:06.124 --> 00:41:08.760
which makes them
all work together.

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:10.640
So I guess, for again
the cast members,

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:12.650
do you guys do anything
specific for this

00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:15.290
to help you prepare for
the emotional journey

00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:16.940
you have to go on?

00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:19.359
ZOISA MAMET: We bounce
on the trampoline.

00:41:19.359 --> 00:41:20.150
DOLLY WELLS: Twice.

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:22.430
Everyone has to do two bounces.

00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:25.160
That was the extent--
the play, we don't--

00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:28.347
I find that really hard talking
about that sort of thing

00:41:28.347 --> 00:41:30.680
beforehand, because I find
that this sounds too English,

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:31.730
but it's cringe-y.

00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:33.010
That's just what I find.

00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:34.280
So I wouldn't probably say.

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:39.940
But I think that the play,
once you get onstage and start

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:43.030
speaking Hamish's words in
this play, that's got as many--

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:46.210
beautiful for us to be in and
do and know what we're doing.

00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:48.567
I think you just have
to get on with it.

00:41:48.567 --> 00:41:49.150
I don't know--

00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:51.250
NORBERT LEO BUTZ:
That's exactly right.

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:54.790
I don't want to
keep pointing out

00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:57.740
Ms. Kristin, the brilliant
Kristin Linklater over there,

00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:59.246
but the first textbook--

00:41:59.246 --> 00:42:01.120
most actors that go
through training programs

00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:04.530
in this country have
to do Linklater work.

00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:07.779
It was the first textbook that I
bought in my undergrad program.

00:42:07.779 --> 00:42:09.820
I did the technique all
through undergrad school.

00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:13.630
And so to be here now, with
her as an audience member,

00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:18.460
and her son as a playwright
is just huge for me.

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:20.320
So how do I prepare?

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:25.180
I think back when I was 19
years old, and I read her work

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:27.640
and "How to Free the Natural
Voice" and all these types

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:32.590
of things, I think I was
preparing 35 years ago for what

00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:34.310
I have to do.

00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:35.780
But Dolly is exactly right.

00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:38.410
There's really no-- you show up.

00:42:38.410 --> 00:42:42.130
You make sure you have your
sleep, have your protein,

00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:45.289
make sure you're rested,
warm up, and then get out

00:42:45.289 --> 00:42:45.830
of your head.

00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:47.830
There's no way to start
the play, or through it,

00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:49.780
except through it.

00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:55.120
And actors try to find so
many ways of how not to begin.

00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:56.920
None of us want to start.

00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:57.720
It's the worst.

00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:58.970
Starting is the worst.

00:42:58.970 --> 00:43:04.660
And this is true, I'm sure from
Olivier down to an overacting

00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:06.980
ham like me.

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:09.160
You want to find
something-- oh please, don't

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:10.545
let it have to happen again.

00:43:10.545 --> 00:43:12.670
Is there any way that I
can get to the curtain call

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:15.040
without actually having
to do all these things?

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:16.510
And there's not.

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:17.150
There's not.

00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:20.110
I absolutely love
that about acting.

00:43:20.110 --> 00:43:23.859
Every day it's a microcosm
of living your life, right?

00:43:23.859 --> 00:43:25.150
One foot in front of the other.

00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:29.110
Get out there, the play starts,
open up and move through it.

00:43:29.110 --> 00:43:31.100
There's really no
way to prepare.

00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:33.910
DOLLY WELLS: And also,
it's having more experience

00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:40.410
with television, it feels
like quite a good lesson,

00:43:40.410 --> 00:43:43.140
just for me, in how to try and
live life when you're onstage,

00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:45.290
which is just basically,
listen very carefully

00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:47.480
to what the other people
are saying to you,

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:49.810
and only listen to them.

00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:53.690
And don't jump at all ahead,
even like a second ahead,

00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:56.497
because you give
yourself a heart attack.

00:43:56.497 --> 00:43:58.830
Because you're thinking, oh
my god, I don't know where--

00:43:58.830 --> 00:43:59.990
I don't know anything.

00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:02.600
So you just have to stay
very, very much in the moment

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:06.200
and listen and think, and feel.

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:07.500
ZOISA MAMET: Yeah.

00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:10.420
DOLLY WELLS: You have to feel,
because it's done for you.

00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:13.780
ZOISA MAMET: I mean, I
think feeling is good.

00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:17.780
But he's written it very well,
so it's like half of it's

00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:18.890
done for you.

00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:21.740
But I also think,
hearkening back

00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:24.770
to what Hamish said before,
that he wants us all

00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:29.810
to have a good time, I think
he really accomplished that.

00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:31.520
And the writing is--

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:34.400
we as actors, we are hams.

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:35.870
That's why we do what we do.

00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:38.410
And we want to go on stage,
and we want to make you laugh.

00:44:38.410 --> 00:44:39.410
We want to make you cry.

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:43.340
We want to make
ourselves cry for you.

00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:45.860
We want to feel
all the feelings.

00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:48.140
But I think, at
the end of the day,

00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:50.500
and Hamish has said
this to us so often

00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:55.332
throughout the
process, just have fun.

00:44:55.332 --> 00:44:57.290
And I try and remember
that every time I go out

00:44:57.290 --> 00:45:00.770
on stage every night, just that
I do this because I fucking

00:45:00.770 --> 00:45:02.180
love it.

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:04.550
And it's this deep,
deep love of the game.

00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:09.050
Because it is quite miserable
at times, and terrifying,

00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:12.680
and sort of awful.

00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:15.050
But it's like a compulsion.

00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:18.200
We do it because we
have to, otherwise

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:21.550
we would have all been bankers.

00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:26.812
And so, to remember that,
to be incredibly present,

00:45:26.812 --> 00:45:29.270
and listen to the people that
you're onstage with, and then

00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:32.300
also just, even in the
scenes where you're

00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:35.670
weeping and crumpled
in a ball on the floor,

00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:38.990
which I do too
much in this play,

00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:40.640
just to remember
that you love it

00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:45.824
and try and take a
huge bite out of that.

00:45:45.824 --> 00:45:46.490
SPEAKER: Lovely.

00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:49.660
There's a quote, actually
that I've found of Norbert--

00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:49.810
do you want to add to that?

00:45:49.810 --> 00:45:52.101
SCOTT ELLIOTT: I was just
going to say one quick thing,

00:45:52.101 --> 00:45:57.040
that I see our job as
making you feel something.

00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:59.430
That's what we do.

00:45:59.430 --> 00:46:02.280
The only way we can do that--

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:04.980
I have the greatest
admiration and respect

00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:08.830
for actors who are
able to do that.

00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:12.990
That's the only way that
I could put my own job,

00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:17.030
and make myself feel like
I'm doing something worthy,

00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:22.560
is to think that our job is
to make people feel something.

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:24.630
SPEAKER: The quote I was
going to bring up here,

00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:26.814
"It's thrilling to be on
stage, and to not know,

00:46:26.814 --> 00:46:28.230
literally, what
the next moment is

00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:32.910
going to bring, to just submit
to the not-knowingness of it.

00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:34.470
I love that you said that.

00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:36.331
Yes, question over here?

00:46:36.331 --> 00:46:37.830
AUDIENCE: Thanks
so much for coming.

00:46:37.830 --> 00:46:39.270
Can't wait to see it.

00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:42.720
And on the topic of
liking to feel things,

00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:45.540
I really appreciated how you all
talked about both the sadness

00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:48.180
but also the humor in the play.

00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:51.120
And I was curious if there
were any rehearsals that

00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:53.310
were particularly humorous
that you could tell us

00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:55.470
about that would give us
insight into the process?

00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:02.780
ZOISA MAMET: I think they've
all been humorous at times,

00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:08.640
especially with a play that
the subject matter is so heavy,

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:10.080
for lack of a better word.

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:13.560
You have to find the
humor in the process,

00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:19.200
otherwise we'd all just
never show up for work.

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:21.450
So yeah, we laugh a lot.

00:47:21.450 --> 00:47:22.700
DOLLY WELLS: Yeah, loads.

00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:28.190
And also there's lines, that
however many times you hear--

00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:31.020
Norbert and I always laugh
about when someone says,

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:33.520
there's a photograph on the
bar, and they say, "Who's that?"

00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:35.520
one of the characters
just says "Ugly children."

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:37.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:39.640
Because we're all so
smug, thinking that

00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:41.681
our children are so
beautiful, that we can laugh.

00:47:41.681 --> 00:47:42.305
It's great.

00:47:42.305 --> 00:47:44.585
Ha ha, imagine having
ugly children, ha ha.

00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:49.920
Also, this sounds really
annoying and actor-y,

00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:51.550
if we have sounded
like that already,

00:47:51.550 --> 00:47:54.430
is that Scott and Hamish have
put together a group of people

00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:56.560
that really, really
like each other,

00:47:56.560 --> 00:48:01.779
and really find each other very
funny, which is really lucky.

00:48:01.779 --> 00:48:03.070
Because you have moments like--

00:48:03.070 --> 00:48:04.962
I have a moment when I
have to lie on a bed.

00:48:04.962 --> 00:48:06.670
And I'm listening to
two or three scenes.

00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:08.878
And you're listing to them
again and again and again.

00:48:08.878 --> 00:48:10.960
But you're feeling so
lucky that you're not only

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:14.050
listening to really
powerful and interesting

00:48:14.050 --> 00:48:16.335
and moving and funny
and peculiar words,

00:48:16.335 --> 00:48:17.710
but you're also
listening to them

00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:20.629
being done by really
talented people who you like.

00:48:20.629 --> 00:48:23.170
So there's quite a few things
all happening at the same time,

00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:26.412
that you feel quite pleased
about, because we all

00:48:26.412 --> 00:48:28.120
get on very well, and
because everybody--

00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:30.850
I can't think of anyone
that doesn't make me laugh.

00:48:30.850 --> 00:48:32.110
We do all laugh quite a lot.

00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:34.151
SCOTT ELLIOTT: It's awful
working with people who

00:48:34.151 --> 00:48:36.600
don't have a sense of humor.

00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:38.177
I mean, we've all
been in a situation

00:48:38.177 --> 00:48:40.510
where we've worked with people
without a sense of humor.

00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:42.250
And that's always hard.

00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:46.360
But I always look
for people, actors--

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:49.730
I'm always attracted to
people with senses of humor.

00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:50.792
It's my-- love it.

00:48:50.792 --> 00:48:52.250
NORBERT LEO BUTZ:
I thought we were

00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:53.920
going to get in trouble
the other night.

00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:55.790
We were in our tech rehearsal.

00:48:55.790 --> 00:48:59.020
We were on, like, hour nine
of just going cue to cue.

00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:00.070
It's just drudgery.

00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:01.810
It's just awful.

00:49:01.810 --> 00:49:04.360
And it was like our eighth
day in a row or something.

00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:09.610
And the play has a lot of joy,
there's a lot of sadness in it.

00:49:09.610 --> 00:49:12.010
And we just get into
these giggle fits.

00:49:12.010 --> 00:49:15.540
And I think your defenses are
down, your body gets tired,

00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:16.559
and it's always--

00:49:16.559 --> 00:49:18.850
Hamish, you know, you're
doing Shakespearean tragedies.

00:49:18.850 --> 00:49:20.350
The end of those
plays, it's so hard

00:49:20.350 --> 00:49:21.730
to do them with a straight face.

00:49:21.730 --> 00:49:23.590
You're either all
in, you're all in.

00:49:23.590 --> 00:49:24.235
SCOTT ELLIOTT: Yeah,
I remember that.

00:49:24.235 --> 00:49:24.970
That was funny.

00:49:24.970 --> 00:49:26.178
No, you guys were having fun.

00:49:26.178 --> 00:49:27.660
I love watching
moments like that.

00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:27.830
DOLLY WELLS: I've got an answer.

00:49:27.830 --> 00:49:28.600
Sorry, go on.

00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:29.490
SCOTT ELLIOTT: I
love when people--

00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:29.990
I love it.

00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:33.070
ZOISA MAMET: Are you talking
about when I said, [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:35.480
SCOTT ELLIOTT: I don't think
Hamish liked it very much.

00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:38.790
But I really loved it.

00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:40.270
DOLLY WELLS: Or when Norbert--

00:49:40.270 --> 00:49:43.130
that's an answer that
I hadn't remembered--

00:49:43.130 --> 00:49:45.190
and I must be very
gullible, but Grace,

00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:46.720
the girl who lies
in the bed, he was

00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:49.230
doing what he said with
his best English accent

00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:50.580
for me and Grace.

00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:53.267
And I was so amazed.

00:49:53.267 --> 00:49:55.100
ZOISA MAMET: He said
it was for an audition.

00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:56.860
NORBERT LEO BUTZ: I said, Dolly,
I have to go on an audition.

00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:58.109
I have to do a British accent.

00:49:58.109 --> 00:49:59.630
I think I've nearly got it.

00:49:59.630 --> 00:50:01.910
Would you just have a listen
to me for a few lines?

00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:03.490
And so I started to--

00:50:03.490 --> 00:50:05.980
(IMITATING TERRIBLE BRITISH
ACCENT) [INAUDIBLE] like this.

00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:10.360
I think I've just aboot got it.

00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:12.520
To be or to be.

00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:15.157
No, that one's not
right-- to be or to be?

00:50:15.157 --> 00:50:15.990
And I had her going.

00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:17.530
It was a dumbest
joke in the world.

00:50:17.530 --> 00:50:19.810
Everybody else knew it
was the dumbest joke.

00:50:19.810 --> 00:50:22.680
And she's like, oh, oh
god, he's really terrible.

00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:23.770
But she was buying.

00:50:23.770 --> 00:50:25.311
DOLLY WELLS: And I
was being so nice.

00:50:25.311 --> 00:50:27.610
I kept saying, have you got
anything that I could help?

00:50:27.610 --> 00:50:29.220
Just maybe, where's he from?

00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:31.915
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:31.915 --> 00:50:34.660
And me and Grace were just
pushing each other's leg.

00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:36.550
I was really scared for him.

00:50:36.550 --> 00:50:39.133
NORBERT LEO BUTZ: I said, well,
it's an interesting character.

00:50:39.133 --> 00:50:43.231
He was born in London, but when
he was two, he moved to Utah.

00:50:43.231 --> 00:50:45.815
But when he was 3 and 1/2
he moved back to London.

00:50:45.815 --> 00:50:47.690
DOLLY WELLS: And then
he moved to Birmingham.

00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:48.700
NORBERT LEO BUTZ: And then
he moved to Birmingham

00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:49.856
when he was six.

00:50:49.856 --> 00:50:51.730
So I'm trying to get
all these little sounds.

00:50:51.730 --> 00:50:53.530
And she's nodding, going oh, OK.

00:50:53.530 --> 00:50:55.120
Let me see if I
can get my head--

00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:56.740
I was like, are you serious?

00:50:56.740 --> 00:50:58.180
You're buying that shit?

00:50:58.180 --> 00:50:59.800
DOLLY WELLS: I was
so disappointed.

00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:02.174
ZOISA MAMET: Dolly Wells is
the most gullible human being

00:51:02.174 --> 00:51:03.340
who's ever existed.

00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:05.350
Every night, Noah
[? Bean ?] and I go--
