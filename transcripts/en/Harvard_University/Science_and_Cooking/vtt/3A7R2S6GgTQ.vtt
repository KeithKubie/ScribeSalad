MICHAEL BRENNER: So welcome.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.660
So my slide says that it's week 10
of the lectures of this series, which

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.770
I find remarkable that we've
been going for 10 weeks already.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.220
And this week, the topic for this week,
the scientific topic for this week,

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.870
is emulsions and foams.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.288
And we're very fortunate to have
Christina Tosi from Milk Bar who's here

00:00:37.288 --> 00:00:37.788
[INAUDIBLE].

00:00:37.788 --> 00:00:39.240
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:41.919 --> 00:00:44.960
Christina has all of these remarkable
things that she's going to show us,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.325
I think perhaps
culminating in this cake.

00:00:47.325 --> 00:00:48.660
Is that the culmination?

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.020
And this cake, which is some
sort of a chocolate chip cake

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.810
is full of emulsions, not foams,
but it's full of emulsions.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.770
Actually it's sort of also full
of foams, kind of foams too.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.220
And so what I want to do
for the next 10 minutes

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.470
while you're getting ready to listen to
her, which is going to be much better,

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.020
is to tell you a little bit about
the science of emulsions and foams

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.310
so you have something to think
about while you're listening.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.897
With that as introduction, I'm going
to start with emulsions and foams.

00:01:18.897 --> 00:01:20.980
And so it turns out that
with emulsions and foams,

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.580
the important ingredient, the
important thing to control

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.960
is also volume fraction.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.470
It's the same idea.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.870
And I want to demonstrate
this before we go into it

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.070
with a very strange sort of experiment.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.747
So these are M&amp;Ms. It
was just Halloween.

00:01:34.747 --> 00:01:37.580
And you'll notice actually, the
interesting thing about M&amp;Ms is that

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.250
when the volume fraction is
low, like it is it is here,

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.470
then it pours like a liquid.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.820
The M&amp;Ms are liquid.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.320
But if you've pack them together in a
jar, now the volume fraction is high

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.312
and now the thing is a solid.

00:01:51.312 --> 00:01:52.270
It's basically a solid.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.050
You could stand on it.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.008
If we had a big container of M&amp;Ms,
we could stand on it and jump around

00:01:56.008 --> 00:01:56.950
in it.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.230
So the volume fraction of M&amp;Ms,
there's a critical volume fraction when

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.130
a material becomes a solid.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.980
And it turns out, for
M&amp;M's it's about 70%.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.920
So the volume fraction-- there's
about 70% air in this thing.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.011
So if anyone's ever entered a count
the number of M&amp;Ms in a jar contest,

00:02:12.011 --> 00:02:15.010
the thing you really need to know,
besides being very good at being able

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.150
to estimate the volume of the
jar, is that 30% of this is air.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.080
But when you make an
emulsion, you have to get--

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.320
there's essentially a little thing of
M&amp;Ms that's inside of it that's playing

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.070
the essence of it.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.474
And I now want to just
show you what it is.

00:02:29.474 --> 00:02:30.640
Would anyone like some M&amp;Ms?

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.510
That's fine.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.499
OK, and actually there's an equation
that we have that describes this.

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:41.790
And actually Christina, you
might be impressed by this.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.706
So what do we do here
when we see an equation?

00:02:43.706 --> 00:02:45.453
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.730
Yeah.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:48.438
It's pretty good.

00:02:48.438 --> 00:02:50.560
This equation is the elastic modulus.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.931
It's basically how solid something is.

00:02:52.931 --> 00:02:55.930
And you have to be about a critical
volume fraction for it to get there.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.710
And that's what that equation says.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.840
So actually in our lab in the
Harvard class, we make lime foam.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.924
I already to you about M&amp;Ms. This also
works for marbles, M&amp;Ms and marbles,

00:03:06.924 --> 00:03:07.590
volume fraction.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.631
Turns out for spheres, the volume
fraction, the critical volume fraction,

00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:11.390
is 64%.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.200
That's actually closer to
what's going on in the things

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.810
that Christina is going to make.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.140
The things that are playing the role
of particles in the emulsions that

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.660
Christina will make are not
actually the shape of M&amp;Ms.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.310
They tend to be more like spheres.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.720
And basically the point is
that of course, as I said,

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.170
this thing has no elastic
modulus, and the one on the right

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.370
has an elastic modulus.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.640
And when you're making
this-- what is that?

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.740
Cream?

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.630
Cream.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.630
CHRISTINA TOSI: There is some passion
fruit curd and coffee frosting.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.780
MICHAEL BRENNER: Right, the
frosting is cream and it better

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.135
basically, be a solid, because
otherwise the whole thing will squish.

00:03:44.135 --> 00:03:44.900
CHRISTINA TOSI: That's right.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:45.490
MICHAEL BRENNER: That's right.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.770
And so it's all about
having an elastic modulus.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.367
Now you can make a plot.

00:03:49.367 --> 00:03:50.450
This is what I like to do.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.460
You can plot elasticity as a
function of volume fraction.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.490
And if you do it with M&amp;Ms, you see
there's a critical volume fraction,

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.559
which for M&amp;Ms is about 70%, at
which the thing becomes a solid.

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:59.850
And that's what you need to do.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.360
You need to get the
volume fraction up to 70%.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.570
Now, it turns out that-- you think this
is so silly, he's talking about M&amp;Ms.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.690
But it turns out the physics of
emulsions is basically the same thing.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.110
Because, so all of these
things are emulsions.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.050
So these are-- so
mayonnaise, an emulsion,

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.510
aioli is an emulsion, whipped cream
and cappuccino foam are all emulsions.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.810
But the analog of the M&amp;M that's
in these things are bubbles.

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.340
And so this is a picture of mayonnaise
under a microscope, Hellman's

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.120
mayonnaise.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.260
I don't know if you've ever seen this.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.985
And look at it.

00:04:29.985 --> 00:04:30.560
It's amazing.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.400
There are all of these little
bubbles that are in there.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.130
And the bubbles are packing
just like M&amp;Ms pack.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.790
And my claim is, the volume fraction
of this bubbles it has to be above 64%,

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.120
because otherwise it won't be a solid.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.690
In fact, in mayonnaise
it's much higher than 64%.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:47.690
I don't know what it is.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:48.610
It's probably 70%.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.810
You can look on the
recipe and see actually.

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.270
It's the volume fraction
of oil that's in the dish.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.520
What I find amazing is,
look at the scale bar.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.000
It's 100 microns.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.230
So Christina, in her icing,
right, there's little particles,

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.440
there's stuff in there.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.749
And the size of it is on
a scale of 100 microns,

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:08.540
and she's going to show
you how to make it.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.950
And just by doing that, just
by doing whatever she does,

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.930
she's making 100 micron sized
objects, just by stirring basically.

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.254
That's what happens.

00:05:16.254 --> 00:05:18.170
And I think it's important
to just take a step

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:19.710
and wonder about things that happen.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.020
I mean, it's so ordinary, that you
wouldn't normally think about it,

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.500
but that's what happens.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.180
Now here's a picture of aioli, which
actually is even harder to make,

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.150
because the emulsifier is
actually in the garlic.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.610
It has bubbles, which are
on an even smaller scale.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.150
So OK, so these things are all
packing of little droplets.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.487
And so this is a picture of what it
looks like, droplets in the background.

00:05:39.487 --> 00:05:41.820
The droplets can either be
oil and water, water and oil,

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.430
or air in a solid.

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:44.480
That's fine too.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.272
And so they're packings
of little droplets.

00:05:46.272 --> 00:05:48.480
And they're really two
different scientific questions

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.000
that you have to ask about these.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.920
The first is, how are the droplets made?

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.190
And the second thing is,
why don't they come apart?

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.460
I mean, the M&amp;Ms don't
apart because they're solid.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.950
But droplets are not solid,
so how do they come apart?

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.680
And so to make droplets, you
use all of the standard methods

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.080
that you've used yourself,
whisking, blending.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.420
There's a KitchenAid over
there, that works fine.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.920
That's how you make little droplets.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.030
That's a droplet-making machine.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.400
That's how I think about it.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.590
Or it's a bubble-making machine.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.660
And that happens because
the thing-- what happens

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.493
is you take these big
droplets and you shear

00:06:19.493 --> 00:06:21.750
them and they come up
apart into little droplets

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.710
and presumably that
happens again and again.

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.001
Now the other thing that's important and
this is the last thing that I will say

00:06:27.001 --> 00:06:29.890
and then I will shut up, is that
droplets, when they collide,

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.390
when two little droplets collide,
they become a big droplet.

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.306
And you don't want that to happen,
because it'll break your mayonnaise

00:06:35.306 --> 00:06:36.820
or it'll mess up the icing.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.897
And so you have to somehow coat the
droplets with armor, a sort of armor,

00:06:40.897 --> 00:06:42.230
that basically keeps them apart.

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.221
And that armor are molecules
that are called surfactants,

00:06:45.221 --> 00:06:47.720
which like to live on the
interface and this is like coating

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:48.930
the thing with armor.

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.990
Now, when you make mayonnaise, does
anybody know where the armor is?

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:54.130
It's in the egg.

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:55.020
It's in the egg.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.170
And it's an amazing
thing, because I don't

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:58.570
know if you've ever made mayonnaise,
but you take oil, water, you just

00:06:58.570 --> 00:06:59.540
pour it in the egg.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.170
And then you stir it up, and
somehow magically, the armor

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:04.425
has to coat all of the
bubbles because otherwise,

00:07:04.425 --> 00:07:08.180
if it doesn't coat all of the bubbles,
then you don't have stable mayonnaise

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.630
and the mayonnaise breaks.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:11.646
And so there are analogs
with what Christina

00:07:11.646 --> 00:07:14.270
is going to do that you should
think about as she's doing them.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.167
And we can talk about
them later if you want.

00:07:17.167 --> 00:07:20.000
Although I suspect that you're going
to find more interesting things

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.864
to talk about.

00:07:20.864 --> 00:07:23.530
So there's a wonderful chapter
in a book the Harold McGee wrote,

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:27.110
that's sadly out of print, that's called
The Curious Cook, in which he calls it,

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.200
Mayonnaise, Doing More With Lecithin.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.560
And Harold asked a very
interesting question

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:35.730
of how much mayonnaise can
you make with a single egg?

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:39.330
And so the questions is, with one
egg, how much mayonnaise can you make?

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.500
Now if you go look at recipes--
so I Googled two fancy recipes.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:46.300
This is a recipe from Alton Brown and
from Martha Stewart, both of whom to me

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.800
seen rather fancy.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:52.920
And you'll notice that with one egg,
Alton Brown calls for one cup of oil,

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:56.410
whereas Martha Stewart calls for one
cup of vegetable oil with one egg.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:59.900
But the question is, how much
can you make with one egg.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:04.390
And so, we, last year when we taught
the HarvardX version of this class,

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:08.767
we had a mayonnaise contest in which
we basically said, take one egg--

00:08:08.767 --> 00:08:10.850
and we had a competition
around the world, who can

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:15.580
make the most mayonnaise with one egg.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.312
And so there is a person who we
only know her by her screen name.

00:08:18.312 --> 00:08:20.020
But that's her screen
name, and she said,

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:24.120
yesterday I made mayonnaise with one egg
and 200 milliliters of sunflower oil.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.320
And she kept going, and
basically at the end

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:30.100
she ended up with 850
milliliters of mayonnaise,

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.780
which is more than three cups.

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:36.030
And this was her process
from one egg yolk.

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:39.080
And so this shows you that you know
you're doing and you have patience,

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.890
you can make a lot of mayonnaise with
one egg and it's all about technique.

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:46.117
And I don't know how this
is a good intro-- say again.

00:08:46.117 --> 00:08:47.450
AUDIENCE: Why would you want to?

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:50.116
MICHAEL BRENNER: Well I guess you
would want to for two reasons.

00:08:50.116 --> 00:08:53.020
One is it's so interesting, like
how much mayonnaise could you

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:54.360
make out of one egg?

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.074
So if you take the HarvardX
version of the class,

00:08:57.074 --> 00:08:58.990
we ask you do something
else that you probably

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:02.040
wouldn't want to do, which
is, we ask you to calculate,

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:07.140
on the basis of the content of one
egg, how much mayonnaise can you make.

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.990
And you'll find it's even much
more than three cups in principle.

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:11.990
You just have to coat all
of the little bubbles.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:13.448
So it's intellectually interesting.

00:09:13.448 --> 00:09:15.960
And also you'll have less
egg in your mayonnaise.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.640
And if you're interested
in less eggy mayonnaise,

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.200
then Gotchava is a
factor of three below.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.700
CHRISTINA TOSI: That's a good point.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:23.616
MICHAEL BRENNER: Yeah.

00:09:23.616 --> 00:09:26.660
Anyway, with that, I think I will turn
it over to Christina and to Jenna,

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.180
and we're really grateful
that you're here.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:31.280
I don't know what mayonnaise has to do
with what you're going to talk about.

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.580
Although there are bubbles in what
she's going to talk about too.

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:34.649
So it's sort of similar.

00:09:34.649 --> 00:09:37.440
But it's really a pleasure to have
you and we're all very grateful.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:37.920
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.170
CHRISTINA TOSI: Oh, thank you.

00:09:43.601 --> 00:09:45.850
MICHAEL BRENNER: So that
thing doesn't work very well.

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:47.797
So [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:47.797 --> 00:09:49.380
CHRISTINA TOSI: We'll see how it goes.

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:49.879
Hi, guys.

00:09:49.879 --> 00:09:51.105
How's it going?

00:09:51.105 --> 00:09:51.730
AUDIENCE: Good.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:53.721
CHRISTINA TOSI: There's a
lot of you here tonight.

00:09:53.721 --> 00:09:54.554
I'm not intimidated.

00:09:54.554 --> 00:09:57.700
Don't worry.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:58.840
Hi thanks for coming out.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.660
I'm so excited that
you guys are either so

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:06.184
interested in emulsions or foams or just
dying to hear everything about Milk Bar

00:10:06.184 --> 00:10:06.850
and watching me.

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:11.490
Make it or you're here because some
of what the cat out of the bag and

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:14.910
found out that we brought corn
flake chocolate chip marshmallow

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:15.900
cookies for you guys.

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.397
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:25.050
I was raised by a mother who
would always reward good behavior

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:27.060
once good behavior happened.

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:30.140
But I like to break the
rules, so we decided

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:31.870
to reward you just for showing up.

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:38.260
And so here are the corn flake
chocolate chip marshmallow cookies.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.770
I'm going to be demoing these cookies.

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:43.830
So my theory is that I'm
feeding you them now,

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:47.630
so if you have any specific questions
about them while I'm making them

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:51.230
or after, you get to
ask whatever you want.

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:56.420
And my only rule about speaking
publicly is that you guys

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:58.510
have as much fun as I have.

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:02.480
So if at any point along the way,
you just have a burning question,

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.310
shout it out.

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:07.480
Or if you're feeling a little shy,
we'll take questions at the end as well.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:13.140
So any which way you want to get
your question out loud, I'll take it.

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:14.350
So I'm Christina.

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:15.140
This is Jenna.

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:19.140
Jenna is our Director of
Culinary Operations at Milk Bar,

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.490
very fancy title for a very fancy lady.

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:24.300
She can also help answer any questions.

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.720
How many of you guys
have been to Milk Bar?

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.720
JENNA: Wo!

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.710
CHRISTINA TOSI: Jenna,
are you impressed?

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:29.293
I'm impressed.

00:11:29.293 --> 00:11:30.460
JENNA: I'm really impressed.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:32.793
CHRISTINA TOSI: How many of
you haven't been to Milk Bar

00:11:32.793 --> 00:11:34.324
but know what Milk Bar is?

00:11:34.324 --> 00:11:35.130
OK.

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:37.610
Does anyone here not
know what Milk Bar is,

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:41.910
but it was just completely intrigued by
free cookies and emulsions and foams.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:42.900
OK. good.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.350
I just like to get, you know, a good
read of how deep I'm going to go

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:47.770
or how not deep I'm going to go.

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:49.740
So I brought this really fun slide show.

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:52.240
Those of you that have been to
Milk Bar know about Milk Bar,

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:57.130
I feel like you'll appreciate the
nuance of a lot of the cookies

00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:00.350
and cakes and pies and bread that
you know and love from Milk Bar.

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:03.780
And those of you that don't,
this a great introduction.

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:09.350
So Milk Bar actually turns
60 years old in 13 days

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:11.260
13, 14 days, which is pretty cool.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.132
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:20.930
We opened Milk Bar as the sister
bakery of the Momofuku restaurants

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:25.360
in New York City that are owned
and run by David Chang who

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.220
I believe came last year to speak.

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:33.800
And I was brought on board at
Momofuku almost nine years ago,

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.110
in a completely undesdrty
related capacity.

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:40.200
I was hired on to sort of work
operations and do odd jobs.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:44.660
And I kind of-- sometimes I have
to trick myself into things,

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:46.610
and so, it worked out
that I was not hired

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:50.730
to be the pastry chef of the Momofuku
restaurants and to open a bakery.

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:53.110
But that's what I became.

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:55.840
I was raised in Virginia.

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:59.040
And my family is largely from
Ohio, so I have a little bit

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.380
of a Midwestern sensibility about me.

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:05.300
I was raised by women that love to bake.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:10.550
And I, in turn, love to eat
dessert, and from a very early age,

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:13.430
also learned to love to bake.

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:19.660
So much so, that I became obsessed
with it and baked from maybe five

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:23.410
or six years old all the way up
until I decided to move to New York

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:28.290
to go to culinary school and
become a pastry chef for a living.

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:31.330
Now the thing about becoming
a pastry chef for a living

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:34.580
is, pastry chef is like a
pretty fancy word, which

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:37.300
usually means that you make
pretty fancy desserts, which

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:38.880
we do at the restaurants.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.540
But have a lot of my spirit and my
heart is in the sort of baked goods

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:46.280
that I grew up with
around baking and in.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:50.000
So Milk Bar, the spirit of Milk Bar,
the sort of personality of Mile Bar

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.110
is very much where home baker meets
someone that went to culinary school

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:55.960
to become a formally
trained pastry chef.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:14:00.760
So everything on the menu is in a very
simple form, a very simple vehicle,

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:07.910
cookies, cakes, slices of pie,
soft serve ice cream, baked breads,

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:10.950
baked savory breads.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:15.210
And they all start with very,
very simple inspiration points.

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:19.320
But then we take our really,
really, really formal knowledge

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:24.100
and experience and expertise from
working in fancier kitchens that

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:29.370
are much more technique driven, and we
apply all of that skill and technique

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:33.630
and knowledge that we have picked up
along the way, we apply it to recipes.

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:36.080
We run every recipe and
technique through the gamut,

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:41.320
and then we put it back into a very
simple cookie recipe or layer cake

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:41.990
recipe.

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:46.210
So just a little rundown of Milk Bar.

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:47.540
This is who we are.

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:52.302
So I'm going to just start to give you
a few of my favorite creation points

00:14:52.302 --> 00:14:54.010
of what we do at Milk
Bar because I think

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:59.090
it's a really fun way to understand what
we do and what I'm about to show you.

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:02.690
So one of the first things
that I ever created long ago

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:04.180
was called cereal milk.

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:06.900
And it's milk that tastes
like what's life in your bowl

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:07.970
after you eat all the cereal out of it.

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:09.136
That's pretty simple, right?

00:15:09.136 --> 00:15:12.200
I was a picky eater as
a kid, and the only way

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.870
my mom could get me to eat
anything of nutritional value

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:18.257
was to promise me a bowl of cereal.

00:15:18.257 --> 00:15:20.090
So I could go to the
grocery store with her,

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:23.089
I spent a lot of my childhood going
to the grocery store with my mother.

00:15:23.089 --> 00:15:25.480
I could pick out any box of cereal.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.360
She was allowed to pour as much
milk into the bowl as she wanted.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:32.409
And the only agreement was that
I had to drink the bowl of milk

00:15:32.409 --> 00:15:33.950
after I ate all the cereal out of it.

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:40.920
And I thought cereal milk would be
a really fun way to approach vanilla

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.470
without giving someone vanilla.

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:44.800
So we don't make make vanilla
ice criminal at Milk Bar

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.930
but we make cereal milk ice cream.

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:52.870
And it has that sort of like riff on
the nostalgic moment of bottoms up

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:54.155
with your bowl of cereal.

00:15:54.155 --> 00:15:56.670
We make it into a drinking milk.

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:59.910
We make it into an ice cream,
and therefore an ice cream pie.

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:02.360
We swirl it up in swirls of soft serve.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.810
We also use it to make a panacotta.

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:10.390
So essentially the creation process
is, either I have a really great flavor

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:11.960
and I know the vehicle it comes in.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.890
So for cereal milk, it's I know I
have this really great flavored milk,

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:18.780
and then all of a sudden we go
down the rabbit hole of, well,

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:23.450
what recipes are milk heavy or what
recipes are flavor milk forward.

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:28.260
Ice cream, drinking milk,
panacotta, sky's the limit.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.520
Cereal milk.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:35.240
Another one of my favorite recipes
of all time is called crack pie.

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:36.980
Has anyone had crack pie?

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.330
Yeah.

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:45.050
So crack pie and is sort
a meeting and gooey butter

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:49.690
cake from Saint Louis and
chess pie from the South.

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:53.280
I fell in love with
the theory of chess pie

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:56.260
because I was reading through
the Joy of Cooking one

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.400
day when I was working
in a pastry kitchen

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.220
and had a little bit of free time.

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.460
And I loved the story behind it.

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:05.230
It's the five that you
make when you don't

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:08.329
have enough apples to
make apple pie, or pecans

00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:11.560
to make pecan pie or
rhubarb to make rhubarb pie.

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:15.599
You basically leave all of those
ingredients out and you may just pie.

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:19.900
And over time, just pie, with that
sort of strident country accent,

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:21.770
became chess pie.

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:24.740
And chess pie nowadays is usually
a little bit more buttermilk based,

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:27.010
so it's a little tangy.

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:29.840
But I really love-- my
favorite part about baked goods

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.250
is that dense gooey fudgy center.

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:35.850
And so crack pie is a
little less buttermilk

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:39.910
that a chess pie, but certainly the same
density and gooey nature that you get

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:42.030
from a Saint Louis gooey butter cake.

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:46.630
It has a toasted oat crust
and this gooey butter filling.

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:51.350
One of our most popular cookies
is called the compost cookie.

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:54.080
The compost cookie-- so we
don't make a chocolate chip--

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:57.562
we don't make just a
chocolate chip cookie.

00:17:57.562 --> 00:17:59.520
We make a corn flake
chocolate chip marshmallow

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:05.630
cookie, which by the sound it, you
guys already have had a very warm,

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:07.160
intimate meet and great with.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.590
And we don't make a chocolate
cookie, but we make a compost cookie.

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:15.890
And a compost cookie has pretzels
and potato chips and butterscotch

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:18.625
and oats and coffee grounds
and Graham crackers.

00:18:18.625 --> 00:18:21.254
And it's basically just like,
you go in your cupboard,

00:18:21.254 --> 00:18:23.170
you want to make a batch
of cookies, you don't

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:26.380
have enough of any single ingredient
to make that type of cookie

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:29.960
so you just put it all in the
mixing bowl and hope it comes out.

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:36.360
And that is very much the spirit of our
approach to baking at Milk Bar as well.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:40.330
So we have this technical background,
and when we want to be intentional

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:41.640
we certainly are.

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:45.520
But we firmly believe in not
taking yourself so seriously.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.760
And that the sort of
creative process can also

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:53.030
be every bit as sort of just
like throw caution to the wind,

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:57.130
throw all of your cupboards'
ingredients into the mixing bowl

00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:59.720
and make a compost cookie.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.860
And this is a bunch of fun ingredients
that go into the compost cookie.

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:08.270
I think the most fun part
about creating at Milk Bar

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:13.430
is keeping it really simple.

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:17.216
The compost cookie, I think is
a great example of the mentality

00:19:17.216 --> 00:19:20.340
that I was raised with in the kitchen,
where it's just waste not, want not.

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:23.760
If you want to make a batch of cookies,
you don't have to go to the supermarket

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:24.970
to make them.

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:29.120
You probably need some butter and an
egg and some sugar, but the rest of it--

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.540
embrace the creative
spirit and sort of make

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:36.320
it work with the limitations of
whatever is left in your cupboard.

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:39.954
The only problem with
that, in modern day terms,

00:19:39.954 --> 00:19:41.870
is that if you live in
New York, you might not

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:43.850
have a bunch of stuff in your cupboard.

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:49.350
And and it's always fun to look at
oats or ground coffee and go like,

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:53.030
oh, I wonder what if, or trying to
look at it with new, fresh new eyes.

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:56.490
And so, what we do to sort
of perpetuate that theory

00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:59.110
is we come up with
new pantry ingredients

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:01.320
that just live in our
kitchen at all times.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:04.270
And we use them in a
multitude of recipes.

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:09.110
One of those staple pantry
ingredients, we call the crunch.

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:14.280
The crunch is just clusters
of basically anything that's

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:18.050
dry, bound together with a little bit
of fat and toasted off in the oven

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:19.230
to caramelize.

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:23.450
And the crunch itself is based
off of staple pantry items.

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:25.230
So we have corn flake crunch.

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:29.060
That was what was in your corn flake
chocolate chip marshmallow cookie.

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:31.780
We have pretzel crunch; we
have Ritz cracker crunch;

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:37.612
we have Fruity Pebble crunch;
we have Cinnamon Toast Crunch;

00:20:37.612 --> 00:20:38.570
we have pretzel crunch.

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:41.910
Anything that's a pantry
item, we'll take out

00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:44.450
and we'll crunch it down by
hand, crush it down my hand,

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:46.460
toss it in a little bit of sugar, salt.

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:48.250
We usually use a little
bit of milk powder

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:51.280
to add chewiness and depth of
flavor, a little bit of fat

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:54.980
to bind it all together, toast it
in the oven and bam, all of a sudden

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:58.230
you have this new souped-up pantry item.

00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:02.570
And we take the crunch and we'll
use it all across our kitchen.

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:05.810
So we'll use corn flake crunch
as a soft serve topping.

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:12.000
We'll use Ritz cracker crunch as a
pie crust, as a shell for a pie crust.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.150
The middle top picture
there is your corn

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:18.340
flake chocolate chip marshmallow
cookie being spread apart

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.030
with those gooey marshmallows.

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:25.480
We'll use it as a textural ingredient
in a fancy, plated dessert.

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:27.820
One of them is a Thai
tea parfait and the other

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:33.020
is a pumpkin ganache with some pear
sorbet, blue cheese, and corn flake

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:33.770
crunch.

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:39.462
So we take these pantry items, we sort
of put a magnifying glass on them,

00:21:39.462 --> 00:21:41.920
but we'll go in when we're
trying to create, we'll be like,

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:44.570
OK, I know I need a textural element.

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:46.640
It could be for anything in any vehicle.

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.846
It can be a textural layer of a cake.

00:21:48.846 --> 00:21:50.970
We'll basically go into
our pantry and be like, OK,

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:52.640
what flavor is going to work best?

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:56.160
So that's a really cool way that
we approach the creative process.

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:59.330
The crumb is very similar
to the crunch, but it's

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:02.269
a little more sandy in its texture.

00:22:02.269 --> 00:22:03.560
We approach it in the same way.

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:09.240
The crumb's basic flavor origin
is anything thing that's dry

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.810
and a powder that has flavor.

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:16.890
So cocoa powder, malted milk
powder, freeze-dried berries ground

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:19.830
into a powder, milk powder.

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:25.280
Anything that is dry and pulverized
down into a powder that has flavor

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.770
can become a crumb.

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:28.700
Same type of technique.

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:31.840
You take that powder,
a little bit of flour,

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:35.830
some sugar, some salt, just to sort
of round the edges of the flavor,

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:39.110
bind it together with some
fat, back it off in the oven,

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:41.100
and you get a flavored crumb.

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:42.310
We have birthday crumbs.

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:43.890
We have milk crumbs.

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:47.410
We have berry milk crumbs, so
freeze-dried berries plus milk crumbs

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:48.920
is berry milk crumbs.

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:53.010
Chocolate crumbs, which we'll use
in the chocolate chip layer cake.

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:56.880
Malted milk crumbs, so milk
crumbs plus malted milk powder

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:59.720
equals malted milk crumbs and so on.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.532
And we'll take those
crumbs in our kitchen

00:23:01.532 --> 00:23:03.490
and we'll dispatch them
in the same way that we

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:05.760
do the crunch in the creative process.

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:10.200
So we'll use crumbs when we're mixing up
a batch of chocolate chocolate cookies,

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:13.840
because we want sandy
pops a flavor and texture.

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.940
We'll mold them into a pie
crust to make a chocolate pie

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:20.740
crust for a banana cream pie filling.

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:25.950
We'll put those crumbs into layer cakes
for bits of some sort of visual draw,

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:28.770
but also textual nuance.

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:31.630
I'll show you the chocolate chip
layer cake a little bit later.

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:37.100
We'll also mix them into cookie is
for the same sort of flavor balance.

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:41.220
The bottom left is our blueberry
and cream cookie being made.

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:45.470
So it's sugar cookie dough
essentially, dried blueberries and milk

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:50.080
crumbs make our blueberry and cream
cookie, which is largely based off

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:55.940
of the muffin top of a blueberry muffin,
my favorite thing in the world to eat.

00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:58.820
I'm going to make chocolate chip
layer cake with you guys tonight,

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:01.410
so you'll sort of see the process.

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:05.310
You'll see a little bit of
an overhead, but very much

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:07.490
the way that we construct
layer cakes at Milk

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:13.900
Bar is breaking down the
rules of traditionally how you

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:17.220
would make a layer cake.

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:20.190
The flavors in layers that
you can put into a layer cake

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:25.476
to sort of defy gravity, but also
understand the weight of each layer

00:24:25.476 --> 00:24:27.850
so that you don't have a cake
that bows out at the edges.

00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:33.770
You have a cake that sits
perfectly at attention.

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:36.310
We make liquid cheesecake at Milk Bar.

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:39.020
I love cheesecake but the best
kind of cheesecake I think,

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:42.030
is the slightly underbaked cheese cake.

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:44.860
So we have a recipe
called liquid cheesecake.

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:48.200
And it's essentially
cheesecake-- ti's not underbaked,

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:52.140
it's just meant to set a little bit
looser than your standard cheesecake.

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:54.420
So we don't make cheesecake at Milk Bar.

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:59.360
But we make liquid cheesecake and we
use it as elements in other recipes.

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:02.800
We don't make an apple pie, but we
do make an apple pie layer cake.

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:08.240
So we have layers of brown butter cake,
layers of those gooey cinnamon apples.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.930
One of the crumbs that
we make is a pie crumb,

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:15.000
so it's a pie dough recipe that
we crumb up, bake in the oven.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.190
We use that as a textural element.

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:21.070
And then we make liquid cheesecake
and fold in brown butter bits

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:25.940
to sort of give those sort of creamy
notes that you get out of an apple pie

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:27.370
and we make this layer cake.

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:28.800
We make a cinnamon bun pie.

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.500
So I love liquid cheesecake.

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:31.960
I love cheesecake.

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:35.430
I also love cream cheese frosting,
but we can't make cinnamon buns

00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:37.170
with cream cheese frosting.

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:38.390
I mean, I suppose we can.

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:41.840
But I feel like we can push beyond that.

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:45.760
So we make a cinnamon bun
pie, which is the top photo.

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:48.900
And it's a bread dough that's
pressed into a pie crust,

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:53.150
and it has layers of liquid cheesecake
and light brown sugar and cinnamon

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:55.950
and salt layered up with a
little bit of a streusel top.

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:59.290
Eaten warm, it's the
best thing in the world.

00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:02.860
We make a cheesecake ice cream
with this liquid cheesecake

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:10.980
that we blend into ice cream base.

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:17.180
We make a desert that has liquid
cheesecake, guava, and a cream cheese

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:21.680
skin, sort of a take
on a Cuban pastelito.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:27.080
And then liquid cheesecake in all of
its glory here at the bottom right.

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:31.920
But a lot of how we create is
thinking about our favorite desserts

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.900
and then how we can
challenge what they are.

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:40.220
So we don't make just a chocolate
chip cookie because a lot of us

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:43.674
love chocolate chip cookies, but we all
love a different chocolate chip cookie.

00:26:43.674 --> 00:26:45.840
Someone likes a really
crispy chocolate chip cookie.

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:49.050
Someone-- I like a fudgy in the center,
crispy on the outside chocolate chip

00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:49.710
cookie.

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:52.910
My grandma also makes the
best chocolate chip cookie.

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:56.310
So even if I tried to make and
sell chocolate chip cookies,

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:58.590
I'd only make the second
best chocolate chip cookie.

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:02.350
And a lot of you probably already have
your favorite chocolate chip cookies.

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:05.020
So why in the world would
I try and open a business

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:06.390
based on chocolate chip cookies.

00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:08.680
That seems like a
terrible business plan.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:14.030
You also have to sell a lot of cookies
to pay the rent, so rather than

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:16.390
compete, it was sort
of like how do we hone

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:20.490
in on what people love about
cheesecake, and figure out how to,

00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:24.825
rather than compete, find a way to
sort of honor everyone's favorite part

00:27:24.825 --> 00:27:27.430
of cheesecake and push beyond.

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:30.270
And I think that's a lot
of the spirit of Milk Bar,

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:33.980
but a lot of the secret to our success.

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:37.384
We don't make food that speaks over you.

00:27:37.384 --> 00:27:39.300
There's nothing worse,
I think, than going out

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:41.920
to a fancy meal or not
fancy meal and feeling

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:47.950
like the food is too smart for you, or
that there's just not the connection

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:50.820
with the food or it's too showy.

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:53.740
I think that a lot of
our technique comes down

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:57.390
to being humble enough to be
like, well, if it's not good

00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:00.960
and you can't eat it in your
hand and sort of ust melt,

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:04.120
and hold that cookie close, then
it doesn't matter how much we know.

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:08.570
It doesn't matter how skilled we
are or what our knowledge base is.

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:12.480
It doesn't matter if we can't
connect with you through what we do.

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:15.750
And the things that you
remember that are food-based

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:19.380
are either food that you have
your memories with already

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:23.640
made, or the things that
you can get in the moment

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.010
and make that relationship with.

00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:28.980
You'll walk out of any restaurant
or any bakery excited and ready

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:30.780
to talk about what you just experienced.

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:33.780
If you have something that's
too fancy or too overdone

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:37.550
or there's not a story that you get and
there's not a connection that you make,

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:38.730
then that moment's lost.

00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:43.050
And all of that hard work and effort to
make something delicious and thoughtful

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:45.450
and all these things is gone.

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:49.200
So hopefully that comes
through what we do.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.320
We also make savory
breads, like I was saying.

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:55.050
We start all of our savory
breads with one dough

00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:56.730
that we call the mother dough.

00:28:56.730 --> 00:29:00.040
And so I thought, well, I want to
have savory breads at Milk Bar,

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:04.380
but you've got to see a lot
of bread to pay the rent.

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:08.720
And making bread is very time-consuming.

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:12.470
And a lot of what-- and we're
not going to make a croissant

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:15.250
and we're not going to
make a pana chocolate

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:16.732
and we're not going to make Danish.

00:29:16.732 --> 00:29:18.190
Because those things already exist.

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:21.210
And you guys probably already have
your favorites of all of those.

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:24.850
So how do we figure out how
to challenge the status quo

00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:28.650
and have a sort of pay honor
to the classic pastry staples

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:30.840
that came before us when we create?

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:34.900
So we start with the
mother dough and we sort of

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:37.920
make it a vehicle for a
bunch of different things.

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:42.110
We make a bread called the volcano,
which is exactly what it sounds like.

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:44.490
It's a flavor explosion.

00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:46.559
It's a cheesy potato gratin.

00:29:46.559 --> 00:29:48.850
It has some pancetta and some
caramelized onions in it.

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:52.130
And we take the mother
dough, we portion it out.

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:55.360
And then we wrap it around this
potato gratin, flip it over,

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.150
these are the top two photos.

00:29:57.150 --> 00:30:00.100
And then put a little
Gruyere cheese on the top.

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:02.340
That's mother dough in volcano form.

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:04.990
We make bagel bombs.

00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:06.469
We can't boil and bake them.

00:30:06.469 --> 00:30:07.260
We don't have time.

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:08.890
We don't run the bagel
business and we're not

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:10.640
trying to compete with
the bagel business.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:15.454
But I love an everything bagel with
some bacon, scallion cream cheese,

00:30:15.454 --> 00:30:16.620
favorite thing in the world.

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:18.180
So we make a bagel bomb.

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:25.449
It's this mother dough, we put a little
bit of sodium carbonate in the dough

00:30:25.449 --> 00:30:27.740
so that you get a little bit
of the chew and the bounce

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:29.750
that you might get in a bagel.

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:32.360
We make rounds of bacon
scallion cream cheese.

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:37.060
We wrap them around the dough,
paint the dough with some egg wash,

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:40.450
put everything, bagel seeds on
it, and we baked the bagel bombs

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:44.520
in a combi oven so it gets
combination steam and convection.

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:47.620
So it gets some of the nuances of
a bagel without competing with it.

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:49.270
That's a bagel bomb.

00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:53.280
And then in this lovely corner, you
will see some crescent shaped breads,

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:55.890
which are croissants in theory.

00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:57.560
But we make a compound butter.

00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:58.430
I love croissants.

00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:00.549
They're so good.

00:31:00.549 --> 00:31:03.590
The thing about croissants is, it's
sort of like a chocolate chip cookie.

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:08.600
It's already made and I get so excited
about how croissants are made, right?

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:11.500
You take this bread
dough, you take butter

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:16.470
and you start folding layers in, almost
like you're playing double dutch.

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:19.440
And I love that, but
my favorite croissants

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:22.200
are the ones that are
stuffed with ham and cheese.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:26.050
So I thought, well, obviously, we're
in the business of stuffing things

00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:30.590
into bread so why not challenge?

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:34.150
So if I have butter, butter's
delicious on its own,

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:37.220
but man, we know how to make
butter taste even better

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:38.290
than its original form.

00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:40.600
So we make compound butters.

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:43.710
This croissant, we make a kimchi butter.

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:48.460
And we layer that into the mother dough,
and then we stuff it with blue cheese

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:51.397
when we're going to roll it
up into a crescent shape.

00:31:51.397 --> 00:31:52.230
JENNA: It's amazing.

00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:53.620
CHRISTINA TOSI: It's amazing.

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:57.190
We make a pastrami and rye croissant.

00:31:57.190 --> 00:32:01.810
We take caraway seeds that are
ground down and almost polarized,

00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:06.650
we mix those into the butter, and
again, layer it into the bread dough.

00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:10.130
And then as we're going to roll the
bread up into its crescent shape,

00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:14.900
we stuff it with sliced pastrami,
Russian dressing, and sauerkraut.

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:17.330
I hope you guys ate before you came.

00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:22.410
It's probably a terrible, terrible
idea to talk about so excitedly.

00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:28.000
But again, we like to challenge
what exists and why it exists.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.180
And it's this sort of just spirit
of curiosity with why does this work

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:35.410
and how does it work and
what if I try something new?

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:38.740
And understanding why
things work, but also

00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:43.410
not being afraid to challenge how you
can evolve that thought process even

00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:44.560
further.

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:47.630
So that's our mother dough.

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:48.130
Yes.

00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:49.270
First question of the night.

00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:51.200
AUDIENCE: How long did it take
you to perfect your mother dough?

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.930
CHRISTINA TOSI: How long did it
take us to perfect the mother dough?

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:55.360
It's a constant work in progress.

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:56.740
No.

00:32:56.740 --> 00:33:02.970
The theory of it, I thought, we
don't make shortcuts in our kitchen

00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:05.710
unless we really need to,
unless they really matter.

00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:08.430
I had been working on the
theory of the mother dough

00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:11.330
long before Milk Bar started.

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:17.600
I'd worked as a pastry cook in a
kitchen and every night before service,

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:21.480
I'd have to make this lavash
dough, so this sort of bread dough,

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:25.090
that I would spread apart on
sheet pans and bake in the oven

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:27.600
to make crackers for service.

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:30.090
And I'd make these huge batches.

00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:33.700
But lavash is-- I mean it's paper thin.

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:37.070
And I made this big batch of
dough and inevitably, there

00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:39.485
was so much dough that
would never get used.

00:33:39.485 --> 00:33:41.710
And so I'd sort of hoard it.

00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:44.602
And that night if I had
time, or the next day,

00:33:44.602 --> 00:33:46.560
I'd come in and sort of
look at it and be like,

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:49.480
I wonder what I can make you into?

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:51.740
And so I would take
that dough and basically

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:54.840
just like adulterate it in
every way you could imagine

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:57.610
to wonder what else I could do with it.

00:33:57.610 --> 00:33:59.180
How forgiving would it be?

00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:01.720
Because a lot of time, it's
like, what's the breaking point?

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:04.100
How forgiving can it be?

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:06.140
But it's always been a work in progress.

00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:09.450
I think the fun part about Milk Bar
now is because the mother dough was

00:34:09.450 --> 00:34:12.050
a work in progress long
before Milk Bar opened,

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:16.239
the fun part is getting to take
what the mother dough was to me

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:21.230
and seeing how other members of my team
take it and look at it and go, like,

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:23.580
oh, I wonder what if?

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:25.284
I saw a few other hands.

00:34:25.284 --> 00:34:26.409
OK, we're going to get shy.

00:34:26.409 --> 00:34:26.940
That's cool.

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:27.670
What do we got?

00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:29.949
AUDIENCE: Do you use the same
mother dough for the croissants?

00:34:29.949 --> 00:34:30.865
CHRISTINA TOSI: We do.

00:34:30.865 --> 00:34:33.031
We use the same mother
dough the croissants, we do.

00:34:33.031 --> 00:34:33.530
We do.

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:34.139
We do.

00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:38.420
So we call them croissants,
but they're not the same.

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:39.800
They have the same layering.

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:47.469
So they get the same puff on the top
from when the water in the butter

00:34:47.469 --> 00:34:49.500
bakes off and creates
those steam pockets that

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.850
then create the sort of flaky
nature of the croissants,

00:34:51.850 --> 00:34:54.749
but the center of the
croissants are always like dense

00:34:54.749 --> 00:34:59.820
and stuffed full of blue cheese and
pastrami and all these other things.

00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:01.100
And so that's always fun.

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:03.970
We called them croissants because
that's what they look like.

00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:05.500
I'll go back to that so
you guys can look at it.

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:06.000
Yes.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.640
AUDIENCE: Is there
one pastry or anything

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:12.097
that you love that you think
is already great as it is

00:35:12.097 --> 00:35:13.680
that you wouldn't want to [INAUDIBLE]?

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:17.550
CHRISTINA TOSI: I think every
pastry that exists largely

00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:21.740
is great as it is, which is why we don't
make any of those pastries at Milk Bar.

00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:25.760
But why, we'll take our love
for the-- I love apple pie.

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:28.710
We don't make the apple
pie cake, because Jenna

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:31.210
is like, you want to know
what's overrated, apple pie.

00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:36.490
She always has an attitude about that.

00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:38.530
JENNA: Yeah.

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:41.140
CHRISTINA TOSI: We look at it,
and we go, fall is coming up

00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:45.040
and how are we going to celebrate
our favorite fall desserts?

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:48.330
And we brainstorm what our
favorite fall desserts are

00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:52.170
and then we go, OK, well how are
we going to best celebrate these

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:56.230
without competing with what's
so beautiful about them

00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:58.780
in their original pastry form?

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:03.240
So I would say largely,
we love every pastry.

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:10.360
And that's why we don't make any of
those pastries one for one at Milk Bar.

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:10.890
OK.

00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:13.237
Then I'm going to keep going.

00:36:13.237 --> 00:36:15.070
You guys can shout it
out whenever you want.

00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:19.950
OK, so we just opened our sixth
store in New York City in Soho,

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:23.160
which is this one.

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:27.390
And the East Village, is
our original Milk Bar.

00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:30.825
In over six years, we've opens six
stores in the US and one in Toronto.

00:36:30.825 --> 00:36:33.450
So if you guys are in New York
City, you should come and visit.

00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:37.610
Williamsburg-- I keep getting it wrong.

00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:40.750
Williamsburg is also where
we do all of our baking.

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:42.775
So we sort of operate on
a hub and spoke model.

00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:49.950
We realized really early on
that the best part of a bakery,

00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:54.340
if you strip down all of the fun flavors
and textures and the creative process,

00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:58.540
you have to have the most
consistent product possible.

00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:01.020
And we realized that the only
way we're going to do that--

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:03.645
and also we didn't want to say
goodbye to each other every time

00:37:03.645 --> 00:37:06.840
we opened a new store, --was to
create one central kitchen that we all

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:07.740
bake in together.

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:09.900
And we do that behind
our Williamsburg store.

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:12.230
And we also offer baking
classes there on Saturdays.

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:15.064
so if you guys are in the city--
all of our stores are fun to visit,

00:37:15.064 --> 00:37:17.354
but the Williamsburg store,
depending on when you come,

00:37:17.354 --> 00:37:19.870
you might get a little peek
into the back of our kitchen.

00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:22.600
It's an 11,000 square foot kitchen.

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:26.390
So we made more-- these cookies that
just fed you was like-- Jenna said,

00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:27.290
no problem.

00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:29.330
I got that.

00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:30.810
This is our team.

00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:34.440
Some of you might recognize Jenna
in some of these fun photos.

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:39.250
You get a little peek into a little bit
of our kitchen in the photo up here.

00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:43.140
But we very much live in
that philosophy of how you

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:45.610
do anything is how you do everything.

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:47.930
And oh, that just disappeared.

00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:49.510
Well, OK, there you go.

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:55.317
And so how we live life
and how we approach life

00:37:55.317 --> 00:37:58.150
and how we approach the relationships
that we have with one another,

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:02.490
is how we approach time in the kitchen
is how we love making desserts.

00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:05.690
And working in a kitchen
is really hard work.

00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:08.750
It's usually grueling and it's
only fun if you make it fun

00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:10.500
and it's as fun as you make it.

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:12.935
And it's as challenging
and rewarding as you

00:38:12.935 --> 00:38:15.560
make it and you get to celebrate
the successes and the failures

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:16.226
with each other.

00:38:16.226 --> 00:38:18.900
So that's our team.

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:20.810
But I'm feel like it's
time to get baking.

00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:21.775
Enough about me.

00:38:21.775 --> 00:38:23.400
AUDIENCE: How do you find great people?

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:24.720
CHRISTINA TOSI: How do
we find great people?

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:25.790
That's a great question.

00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:28.630
It is always a work in progress.

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:34.350
I think that if I had to strip
down all of the technicalities,

00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:39.110
I'd say great people attract
great people, just in general.

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:43.465
Case in point.

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:47.370
You sort of figure it out.

00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:50.110
We're very protective about
who we let through the doors

00:38:50.110 --> 00:38:52.740
and who we let on our team.

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:54.890
I am a long distance runner.

00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:57.494
I always want to ask people
like, what are your parents like?

00:38:57.494 --> 00:38:59.910
How did they raise you and are
you a long distance runner?

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:02.000
Because those are things that I know.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.860
I know for sure that are like,
Jenna's parents are amazing.

00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:10.910
And she's not a long distance runner,
which is not a strike against her,

00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:12.300
at all, Jenna.

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:14.340
But there's something
about how you're raised.

00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:16.240
And the long distance
running for me, is just

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:19.930
like the endurance of like just never
quitting and always going and just

00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:22.250
strong and steady.

00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:27.730
It's tricky to read that into
people and to read that out

00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:29.480
of people in the moment.

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:33.140
But a lot of it is also trained,
where like if you're inspired,

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:34.810
amazing things can come out of you.

00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:38.990
Where like, even in someone that
you might think is questionable,

00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:42.140
I think that if you are
a good person and you

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:46.134
can inspire the love of what we
do in the kitchen, a lot of that

00:39:46.134 --> 00:39:47.800
comes out of people in really cool ways.

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:51.460
And that's part of the
fun of hiring new people

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:54.460
and watching then develop
into these amazing people.

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:58.230
So sometimes it's not just hiring great
people, it's hiring great potential

00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:00.900
and watching them become great people.

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:02.187
That's hard.

00:40:02.187 --> 00:40:03.270
That doesn't pay the rent.

00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:05.500
I mean, it pays the rent
in some way, but if it's

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:10.720
by far the most valuable thing, the
most valuable element, of our business.

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:13.701
I think probably of any business.

00:40:13.701 --> 00:40:14.200
OK.

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:16.950
It's corn flake chocolate
chip marshmallow cookie time.

00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:19.300
How many of you guys have made corn
chocolate chip marshmallow cookies

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:19.800
at home?

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.157
JENNA: Oh, yeah.

00:40:22.157 --> 00:40:23.740
CHRISTINA TOSI: How did they turn out?

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:27.300
Did anybody have cookies
that fell flat or laced out?

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:27.930
Be honest.

00:40:27.930 --> 00:40:28.690
It's totally fine.

00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:29.260
Yeah, I know.

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:30.660
It happens some times.

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:34.802
So the reason that we wanted
to bring this recipe with us,

00:40:34.802 --> 00:40:36.510
the corn flake chocolate
chip marshmallow

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:41.630
cookie is-- don't tell any of the
other cookies, --is my favorite cookie.

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:43.140
Don't tell any of the other cookies.

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:44.810
They're not here with us tonight.

00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:48.460
It's one of my favorite cookies
for a few different reasons.

00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:52.840
It's the most-- it's a cookie that's
the most similar to a chocolate chip

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:55.120
cookie for sure.

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:58.840
It's also my favorite cookie because
it has more butter and sugar in it

00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:00.970
than any of the other cookies we make.

00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:10.880
And that's a really tricky
sort of like-- like,

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:16.320
you have to really defy all of the
sort of elements of the universe

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:18.787
in order to force that much
butter and sugar into a cookie

00:41:18.787 --> 00:41:20.120
to make it taste that delicious.

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:24.430
It is, because it just is.

00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:31.660
I used to work for a chef, and he swore
that his wife made the best chocolate

00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:32.400
chip cookie.

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:35.180
I was scarred at an early
age as a pastry cook.

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:38.730
And I'd always try to get to the
bottom of why they tasted so good.

00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:42.070
And one day he was like, I think she
sneaks extra butter into them when

00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:42.840
no one's looking.

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:44.100
That's why they're so good.

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:47.780
I thought, huh, that's a
really interesting approach.

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:51.530
What if I'd been using the wrong
amount of butter the entire time,

00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:53.260
and all I need is to use more butter?

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:58.920
The problem with butter is, if you don't
make the bonds in the mixing process,

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:01.360
it's just going to bake
out onto your baking tray

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:04.500
and your cookies are going
to fall flat and lace.

00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:09.620
And so we're going to get just
a little dorky about what we do

00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:13.384
and how we create a nice protective
armor around the butter and the sugar

00:42:13.384 --> 00:42:16.550
and how we help it defy gravity in the
corn flake chocolate chip marshmallow

00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:18.530
cookie in the process.

00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:22.450
So this cookie recipe
is online for any of you

00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:25.550
that are going to feel super
inspired after eating your cookie

00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:31.320
or watching this stunt on stage.

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:33.910
So all of our cookies,
all of our baked goods,

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:39.770
start with unsalted
European style butter.

00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:44.280
Pastry chefs usually--
there's usually two camps.

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:46.450
I'm in the camp of
pastry chefs that loves

00:42:46.450 --> 00:42:48.980
to bake with European style butter.

00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:52.160
And I also like to bake with salt.

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:57.260
Other pastry chefs swear by the
exact opposite for their own reasons,

00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:59.570
which are completely legitimate.

00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:04.840
European style butter is made
with dairy that's cultured

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:06.560
before it's churned into butter.

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:09.410
So it already has this
really great depth of flavor.

00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:11.990
And I think a lot of that
is what adds to the sort

00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:17.070
of like, just depth of flavor that
you taste in any of our baked goods.

00:43:17.070 --> 00:43:21.570
They're not good, they're great,
because of this European style butter.

00:43:21.570 --> 00:43:25.510
Now, we love to bake with salt, but we
like to be able to control the salt.

00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:28.020
Baked goods aren't just about
being sweet and adding salt

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:33.280
to a recipe that is a baked good
is not about it being salty.

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:36.540
So it's not about making a
salted caramel every time.

00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:38.950
Salt just helps bring out the flavor.

00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:41.600
It helps sharpen the edges of flavor.

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:46.030
We don't add salt to make the
baked good taste salted or salty.

00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:49.870
But we like to be able to control
the amount of salt that we put in.

00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:54.580
So we start with unsalted
European style butter.

00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:57.090
We like to add the salt in with
some of the dry ingredients.

00:43:57.090 --> 00:43:57.460
Yes.

00:43:57.460 --> 00:43:58.376
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.180
CHRISTINA TOSI: We use Plugra
butter, which is actually

00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:07.323
made in Pennsylvania, which is close.

00:44:07.323 --> 00:44:09.390
Close.

00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:11.520
I like to always say,
when you're baking,

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:14.070
and you're at the grocery store,
if you can make one choice,

00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:15.590
choose unsalted butter.

00:44:15.590 --> 00:44:19.240
Because it's really important to be
able to control the salt after the fact.

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:23.550
If you make two choices,
unsalted European style butter.

00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:26.070
All of our recipes start with it.

00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:26.700
Sugar.

00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:33.020
so this is-- if you were to compare
this recipe with the standard Toll House

00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:35.680
cookie recipe, it looks almost the same.

00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:39.380
I just said that we add, that we
sneak extra butter and extra sugar

00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:40.500
into the mix.

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:42.732
It looks like the same one
for one amount of butter,

00:44:42.732 --> 00:44:45.190
if you're going to compare to
the Toll House cookie recipe.

00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:47.080
But what we do is add less flour.

00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:49.700
So depending on how you look
at it, we either add less flour

00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:52.274
or, I like to describe it as
adding more butter and sugar

00:44:52.274 --> 00:44:54.190
because I think that's
a more fun and easy way

00:44:54.190 --> 00:44:57.560
to comprehend why it tastes so good.

00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:03.440
So light brown sugar,
regular sugar, go to the bowl

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:06.310
and we start the creaming process.

00:45:06.310 --> 00:45:12.130
Most baked goods start by
creaming together fats and sugars

00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:16.000
to help start the batter.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.820
These are the hardest
ingredients to break down

00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:23.120
and to incorporate, which is
why you start with them first.

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:27.590
I'm going to crack-- we're going
to let this go for a few minutes.

00:45:27.590 --> 00:45:28.860
One large egg.

00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:32.180
We bake with large eggs in our kitchen.

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:37.420
I like the ratio of an egg white
to egg yolk and vanilla extract.

00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:42.770
All baked goods, in my
opinion, taste delicious

00:45:42.770 --> 00:45:48.100
and taste like home when they
have vanilla extract in them.

00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:50.710
Most of our recipes have a
little bit more vanilla extract

00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:53.810
than the average Toll
House cookie recipe.

00:45:53.810 --> 00:45:57.620
I realized-- one day, I was just
like, I wonder what would happen like,

00:45:57.620 --> 00:46:00.710
what's the breaking point
with vanilla extract?

00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:07.350
And I realized in doing so, that vanilla
extract really adds-- it's not about it

00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:10.290
tasting like a vanilla
cookie, it's just something

00:46:10.290 --> 00:46:15.880
about the scents and the flavor that
it does sort of set in place in a cake

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:19.690
batter, in a cookie batter, that
tastes like, just a delicious

00:46:19.690 --> 00:46:23.460
baked good that your mom or your aunt or
your uncle or your neighborhood bakery

00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:25.930
made, that you have a relationship with.

00:46:30.170 --> 00:46:35.510
We learned really early on that
you have to paddle the heck out

00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:39.410
of the butter and the sugar in
this stage to really make them

00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:42.840
like each other, to make
them bond together so

00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:47.840
that they can defy gravity in the oven.

00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:50.310
I'm going to let Jenna
take over this part,

00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:53.116
so that you guys don't have to
listen to the whole mixer over here.

00:46:53.116 --> 00:46:54.032
What do we got up top?

00:46:54.032 --> 00:46:55.532
AUDIENCE: What's the breaking point?

00:46:55.532 --> 00:46:57.320
CHRISTINA TOSI: What's the break point?

00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:58.944
That's actually a really good question.

00:46:58.944 --> 00:47:02.140
I don't know we've been gone
so far with butter that we

00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:04.185
haven't been able to force it together.

00:47:04.185 --> 00:47:05.580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:06.255
CHRISTINA TOSI: Say that again.

00:47:06.255 --> 00:47:06.985
AUDIENCE: Vanilla extract?

00:47:06.985 --> 00:47:08.943
CHRISTINA TOSI: Oh, what's
the vanilla extract,

00:47:08.943 --> 00:47:11.540
[LAUGHING]

00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:13.680
I would say it's a matter of opinion.

00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:17.750
It just comes down to your palate.

00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:21.280
For like a standard batch of
cookies, like two sticks of butter,

00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:27.060
you can go as deep as three teaspoons,
but it gets a little like you

00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:30.620
kind of, start to wink
at it a little bit.

00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:32.640
It's a matter of opinion,
but we usually like

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:37.750
to use like close to two teaspoons,
which is almost twice what

00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:40.530
a standard chocolate recipe calls for.

00:47:40.530 --> 00:47:42.750
It depends on what you're
using it in and what

00:47:42.750 --> 00:47:44.580
other flavors your offsetting with it.

00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:45.080
Yes.

00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:47.742
AUDIENCE: What like
portion of your time is

00:47:47.742 --> 00:47:49.920
spent in recipe development
versus production?

00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:51.850
CHRISTINA TOSI: What
portion of our time is

00:47:51.850 --> 00:47:56.270
spent in recipe development
versus production?

00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:58.590
We have an 11,000 square foot kitchen.

00:47:58.590 --> 00:48:06.580
We have an entire production kitchen
that operates seven days a week.

00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:10.020
We also have a classroom, this
classroom that I was telling you about

00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:12.530
that we teach classes in on Saturdays.

00:48:12.530 --> 00:48:17.500
Usually Monday through Friday,
we develop recipes in there.

00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:21.300
So we have laundry
lists of things that we

00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:25.677
want to create, either curiosities
or points of inspiration,

00:48:25.677 --> 00:48:27.010
like the black and white cookie.

00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:29.884
Like I got to figure out what
our black and white cookie is.

00:48:29.884 --> 00:48:31.550
Because I love a black and white cookie.

00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:33.830
I haven't figured that out yet.

00:48:33.830 --> 00:48:36.430
All the way down to like actual
tasks, where it's like, OK,

00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:37.300
we're going to change our menu.

00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:39.091
We need to come up with
soft serve flavors.

00:48:39.091 --> 00:48:41.107
Or we need to change
the menu at Ssam Bar.

00:48:41.107 --> 00:48:41.940
What are some ideas?

00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:44.540
And we start to play in that process.

00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:50.550
But there's usually two or three
of us that are working on stuff.

00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:56.760
I'm here tonight so I'm definitely
not part of the R&amp;D process today.

00:48:56.760 --> 00:49:00.600
But I usually am more of like the
idea and the taste tester now,

00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:04.579
more so than like the idea, the
starting point of recipes, OK,

00:49:04.579 --> 00:49:05.620
let's taste through them.

00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:06.328
Bring the recipe.

00:49:06.328 --> 00:49:08.090
Let's talk about what's happening.

00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:11.820
So I feel like I've become more of like
the Michael, where everyone's excited.

00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:15.440
But then sometimes people
don't listen for sure.

00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:16.400
Pop quiz?

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:18.340
Failed.

00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:21.490
But it's a completely
collective process.

00:49:21.490 --> 00:49:25.410
So five out of seven
days a week, we actually

00:49:25.410 --> 00:49:29.170
have individuals that are working
towards recipe development and menu

00:49:29.170 --> 00:49:29.690
development.

00:49:29.690 --> 00:49:33.670
But I sort of always like to think of
it as well as like all day, every day.

00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:36.940
Because it's amazing where
and when lightning strikes.

00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:41.180
When someone accidentally
adds molasses to a recipe.

00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:41.955
I hate molasses.

00:49:41.955 --> 00:49:46.000
When somebody accidentally adds it and
we taste it, because we're like, well,

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.720
we can't throw this away.

00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:50.170
We taste it and it's like,
OK, this is disgusting.

00:49:50.170 --> 00:49:54.714
But it tastes like something
malted or malty or pretzely.

00:49:54.714 --> 00:49:56.630
And then all of a sudden
it's like, all right,

00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:59.350
molasses is our new secret
weapon ingredient when

00:49:59.350 --> 00:50:04.050
we want to make pretzel cake or we
want to make malted chocolate peanut

00:50:04.050 --> 00:50:06.960
butter soft serve or what have you.

00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:09.650
So at any point in
time in our kitchen, we

00:50:09.650 --> 00:50:13.100
could be just moments away
from a kitchen disaster

00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:20.050
that then turns into a really cool
R&amp;D uncovering which is really fun.

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:20.950
How are we looking?

00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:21.450
JENNA: Good.

00:50:21.450 --> 00:50:23.630
I just added the egg and the vanilla.

00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:26.860
And now we're in a really crucial
part of our mixing process.

00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:28.752
CHRISTINA TOSI: OK.

00:50:28.752 --> 00:50:30.585
I was worried that if
I told you how long it

00:50:30.585 --> 00:50:33.250
was going to take that you guys
would stop paying attention.

00:50:33.250 --> 00:50:36.819
So jokes on you.

00:50:36.819 --> 00:50:39.360
When we mix the corn flake
chocolate chip marshmallow cookies

00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:43.140
and we're forcing all of that
extra butter and sugar together,

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:45.020
we call it the 10
minute creaming process.

00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:46.740
Because we cream it for 10 minutes.

00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:49.140
And we don't cream it like
on medium for 10 minutes.

00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:54.170
We are agitating that sucker
on high for 10 minutes.

00:50:54.170 --> 00:50:56.850
The butter and the sugars
together, they start to get fluffy,

00:50:56.850 --> 00:50:59.850
they start to aerate, as you
can sort of see maybe down

00:50:59.850 --> 00:51:01.420
into Jenna's bowl a little bit.

00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:02.310
JENNA: Can you see?

00:51:02.310 --> 00:51:04.143
CHRISTINA TOSI: Oh,
yeah, you're good, girl.

00:51:04.143 --> 00:51:12.810
And then we add that one large
egg, cold, into the mixture.

00:51:12.810 --> 00:51:18.500
Because if you cream the heck out
of butter and sugar for 10 minutes,

00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:22.430
the friction that you're creating on
the sides of the bowl, at some point

00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:26.417
are just going to keep that butter up
and it's going to start to liquefy,

00:51:26.417 --> 00:51:28.000
which is not going to be a good thing.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:31.290
So we use that egg as the armor.

00:51:31.290 --> 00:51:34.510
It helps keep the mixture
cold and that egg yolk really

00:51:34.510 --> 00:51:40.340
helps coat the butter and
the sugars that we are just

00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:45.925
trying to make love each other
and bond together in this process.

00:51:45.925 --> 00:51:46.464
Yeah.

00:51:46.464 --> 00:51:47.380
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:53.210
CHRISTINA TOSI: Say that one more time.

00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:57.030
Can you over cream the
butter and the sugar?

00:51:57.030 --> 00:52:01.220
I would say, my definition of
overcreaming the butter and the sugar

00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:04.180
would be the butter and
the sugar liquefying.

00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:08.990
So usually, three to four minutes into
the process is when we add an egg.

00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:14.030
Or in an our kitchen we make--
this is probably a five quart bowl.

00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:16.582
We make our cookies in 140 quart bowls.

00:52:16.582 --> 00:52:19.540
So it's a bowl that's big enough,
Jenna could take a bubble bath in it.

00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:22.370
JENNA: It's like that.

00:52:22.370 --> 00:52:27.500
CHRISTINA TOSI: So we're adding
many, many, many cold, large eggs.

00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:32.050
And those egg yolks are really
what helps the process bond.

00:52:32.050 --> 00:52:32.779
Yes.

00:52:32.779 --> 00:52:34.735
AUDIENCE: The [INAUDIBLE]
theory about cooking

00:52:34.735 --> 00:52:37.424
is that you don't want
to cream the butter

00:52:37.424 --> 00:52:41.825
and the sugar for very long because
the sugar boring holes in the butter

00:52:41.825 --> 00:52:45.410
is what aerates something
light and fluffy like a cake.

00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:48.522
So, she mixes it together
for like 60 seconds.

00:52:48.522 --> 00:52:50.230
CHRISTINA TOSI: And
then is done with it.

00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:50.920
AUDIENCE: What is your thought on that?

00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:52.670
CHRISTINA TOSI: What's
my thought on that?

00:52:54.942 --> 00:52:56.650
I love [INAUDIBLE] I
think she's amazing.

00:52:56.650 --> 00:53:04.500
When I make chocolate chip cookies at
home, 60 seconds, 45 seconds, I'm done.

00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:10.230
To get the butter and the sugars
to bond together in this ratio,

00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:14.630
absolutely will not happen unless
you start to incorporate air

00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:17.090
into the mixture in this capacity.

00:53:17.090 --> 00:53:20.000
So part of it is ratio based.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:25.080
And then the other part of it is,
what you want that and product to be.

00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:29.940
There's a really great
website called Serious Eats.

00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:32.460
One of their writers did,
I think, it's something

00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:37.840
crazy like a 10 page study on how to
make the best chocolate chip cookie.

00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:42.600
And he and has a diary of all
the things that he figured out.

00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:44.860
And one of them is creaming
the butter and the sugar.

00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:48.440
So it depends on the ratio of the two.

00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:50.130
And it's not just butter to sugar.

00:53:50.130 --> 00:53:51.880
It's butter to sugar to the
rest of your ingredients,

00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:53.095
largely your dry ingredients.

00:53:53.095 --> 00:53:56.261
AUDIENCE: You know what would happen
if you creamed the butter and the sugar

00:53:56.261 --> 00:54:01.120
here for like 60 seconds and then added
the egg and creamed for 10 minutes?

00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:04.230
CHRISTINA TOSI: Oh, if I just
creamed the two together quickly

00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:05.660
and then added the egg?

00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:08.400
It'll still go like this.

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:13.350
We start with cold butter
and it's really hard

00:54:13.350 --> 00:54:18.510
to get cold butter just to even
consider liking sugar if you only

00:54:18.510 --> 00:54:20.440
mix it for 60 seconds.

00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:24.375
So part of it is also the temperature
of your butter in that stage.

00:54:24.375 --> 00:54:25.309
Yes.

00:54:25.309 --> 00:54:26.225
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:54:28.377 --> 00:54:30.210
CHRISTINA TOSI: So we
start with cold butter

00:54:30.210 --> 00:54:34.650
because we know that we're going
to be paddling the heck out

00:54:34.650 --> 00:54:38.140
of it for 10 minutes and we
don't want it to liquefy.

00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:42.600
It's largely that, but
it's also easier for us

00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:47.740
to use cold butter because we store our
butter cold, and it's harder to-- we

00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:50.830
get a more consistent product knowing
that every cook walks straight

00:54:50.830 --> 00:54:54.079
into the walk-in, grabs all the
butter cold and pulls it out.

00:54:54.079 --> 00:54:56.120
Rather than getting to
the point of, well, what I

00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:59.036
think is room temperature butter
might be different than someone else.

00:54:59.036 --> 00:55:02.420
And then all of a sudden,
you have to probe the butter

00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:05.990
to understand what
the starting point is.

00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:06.490
Yes.

00:55:06.490 --> 00:55:07.406
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:17.750
CHRISTINA TOSI: And
usually-- in the question

00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:22.930
was, just going back
to the comment of us

00:55:22.930 --> 00:55:25.180
baking with unsalted
European style butter

00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:27.380
and then adding salt after the fact.

00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:31.720
And what the other camp that-- the
other camp, that I mentioned is.

00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:36.610
It's usually pastry chefs--
well, the salts factor

00:55:36.610 --> 00:55:41.710
is usually a matter--
now, no one get mad.

00:55:41.710 --> 00:55:45.510
But it's usually a matter of
like European style pastry chefs

00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:47.350
versus American style pastry chefs.

00:55:47.350 --> 00:55:52.330
I think American style pastry chefs
are not as afraid to use salt.

00:55:52.330 --> 00:55:58.280
Or that's just part of-- we
like really sharp, bold flavors.

00:55:58.280 --> 00:56:00.750
And I think often times,
you don't find that as much.

00:56:00.750 --> 00:56:06.890
The European style butter versus the
not, depending on what you're making,

00:56:06.890 --> 00:56:09.650
a lot of pastry chef
that make cakes and that

00:56:09.650 --> 00:56:16.430
make really, really fluffy, delicate,
like almost spongy, or foam cakes,

00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:20.100
European style butter
almost has a heftiness to it

00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:22.950
and will weigh down a recipe.

00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:25.260
We make American style cakes.

00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:27.710
So we're starting with
butter and sugar and then

00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:31.060
we're adding oil and other fats.

00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:33.130
It makes the crumb structure more dense.

00:56:33.130 --> 00:56:37.220
It makes those holds and
air pockets much smaller.

00:56:37.220 --> 00:56:39.750
But that's the style
of cake that I prefer.

00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:44.579
But usually the camp that dos
not like European style butter,

00:56:44.579 --> 00:56:46.870
doesn't like it because of
the weight that it sometimes

00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:50.280
brings in more delicate recipes.

00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:51.629
OK cool.

00:56:51.629 --> 00:56:52.670
What do we got over here?

00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:53.630
JENNA: One more minute.

00:56:53.630 --> 00:56:55.838
CHRISTINA TOSI: All right,
we've got one more minute.

00:56:55.838 --> 00:56:59.230
I make, when I'm at
home, if I'm not even

00:56:59.230 --> 00:57:02.580
willing to give 60 seconds
to the creaming process,

00:57:02.580 --> 00:57:04.710
I will melt the butter and go.

00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:09.530
Again you're going to get a
different texture in your end cookie,

00:57:09.530 --> 00:57:12.880
depending on how long you
mix the dry ingredients,

00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:16.450
how cold the dough is before you
scoop it and form it and bake it.

00:57:16.450 --> 00:57:18.590
You might get a little
lacing on the outside

00:57:18.590 --> 00:57:22.040
of the cookie, which is basically
just the butter baking out

00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:28.110
a little bit because it wasn't
emulsified properly with the starch.

00:57:28.110 --> 00:57:30.290
It wasn't mixed in
full and some of it was

00:57:30.290 --> 00:57:35.440
left to basically lace out
and bake on the baking tray.

00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:39.050
But that's essentially-- you
can do it with some recipes,

00:57:39.050 --> 00:57:42.930
but this cookie recipe has so
much butter that there's not--

00:57:42.930 --> 00:57:47.580
if you don't create this bond early on
in this process, you've got no chance.

00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:49.230
I, mean they'll be fine.

00:57:49.230 --> 00:57:53.100
They'll just be flat and lacy and
you'll see all the extra butter that you

00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:57.150
spend your money on your sheet tray.

00:57:57.150 --> 00:58:00.380
They end up tasting a
little greasy as such.

00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:02.890
So we're 10 minutes, done.

00:58:02.890 --> 00:58:08.230
So it's light, it's fluffy,
it's glossy, it's voluminous.

00:58:08.230 --> 00:58:12.180
All of these things have happened
during the 10 minute creaming process.

00:58:12.180 --> 00:58:16.750
JENNA: It's like lighter when
you go to scrape down the bowl.

00:58:16.750 --> 00:58:17.530
Feels lighter.

00:58:17.530 --> 00:58:19.220
CHRISTINA TOSI: Feels lighter.

00:58:19.220 --> 00:58:20.970
OK.

00:58:20.970 --> 00:58:25.530
And then, just like any cookie recipe,
we're going to add our dry ingredients.

00:58:25.530 --> 00:58:27.980
So we have an all purpose flour.

00:58:27.980 --> 00:58:32.685
Our all purpose flour actually
has a pretty high protein content.

00:58:32.685 --> 00:58:35.140
It has a protein content
that almost makes

00:58:35.140 --> 00:58:39.760
it eligible to be a bread flour,
which helps because we don't want

00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:47.450
to add a lot of this flour and we want
it to-- if you think about what bread

00:58:47.450 --> 00:58:52.560
flour will do in a
bread recipe, it's going

00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:57.520
to hydrate and start to develop
the gluten strands of bread dough

00:58:57.520 --> 00:58:58.970
that you think about.

00:58:58.970 --> 00:59:00.850
It's very strong.

00:59:00.850 --> 00:59:05.860
It wants to become bread, I suppose
is the best way to think about it.

00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:07.925
All purpose flour is
a little bit weaker.

00:59:07.925 --> 00:59:10.550
If you think about trying to make
bread with all purpose flour,

00:59:10.550 --> 00:59:13.630
it's harder to get that formation.

00:59:13.630 --> 00:59:16.440
It's harder to make
that sort of dough ball.

00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:20.150
We like to use a high protein flour,
especially in this cookie recipe,

00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:23.180
because we all this
extra butter and sugar

00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:27.020
and it's going to want to
break down and melt out.

00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:29.710
But we want to give it a little
bit more to sort of bond to.

00:59:29.710 --> 00:59:33.380
So we use this higher
protein all purpose flour.

00:59:33.380 --> 00:59:36.660
Kosher salt, we already
talked about that.

00:59:36.660 --> 00:59:40.310
We like to use kosher salt as opposed
to sea salt or our table salt, which

00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:41.640
is iodized salt.

00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:43.880
Mostly because kosher
salt doesn't really

00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:47.850
taste salty, whereas I think
table salt and sea, for my palate,

00:59:47.850 --> 00:59:49.510
it tastes salty.

00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:52.590
And again, the goal is not to make
salted corn flake chocolate chip

00:59:52.590 --> 00:59:53.700
marshmallow cookies.

00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:55.120
It's to make corn flake
chocolate chip marshmallow

00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:56.575
cookies that are well balanced.

00:59:56.575 --> 00:59:58.700
Kosher salt is the salt
that we use in our kitchen.

00:59:58.700 --> 01:00:02.646
There's some baking powder
and there's some baking soda.

01:00:02.646 --> 01:00:05.020
Those are going to be leaveners
that help the cookie puff

01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:10.320
and spread and give great texture
and flavor, believe it or not.

01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:12.520
So we mix these dry
ingredients together.

01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:16.110
We mix them together for a
very short period of time.

01:00:16.110 --> 01:00:18.910
Remember, we're adding this
flour that's pretty high protein.

01:00:18.910 --> 01:00:21.650
We're not trying to
make bread, so we need

01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:23.750
to be very conservative
about the amount of time

01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:30.440
that we spend mixing the flour
into the butter, sugar, egg bond

01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:31.396
that we just made.

01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:37.530
I like to stop when it's
this weird shaggy mixture.

01:00:37.530 --> 01:00:38.520
Does that look mixed?

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:40.590
Absolutely not, but guess what?

01:00:40.590 --> 01:00:45.140
We still have corn flakes, chocolate
chips, and marshmallows to add.

01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:48.640
So the thing to think about
when you're mixing is not just,

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:50.580
OK, I know I need to add
dry ingredients and I

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:53.060
know it needs to be a
nice homogeneous mixture.

01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:55.530
It also has to be
consideration with what else

01:00:55.530 --> 01:00:58.770
you're going to do with the
dough before it's done mixing.

01:00:58.770 --> 01:01:01.100
So I mix it to this shaggy space.

01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:02.950
We're going to add our corn flakes.

01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:06.820
These are corn flake crunch actually,
which is like a caramelized corn flake.

01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:08.930
They were on the crunch
slide that we looked at.

01:01:08.930 --> 01:01:10.820
Corn flakes.

01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:14.210
Sugar and salt like we talked about,
not a lot, just to round out the edges.

01:01:14.210 --> 01:01:16.330
Milk powder, like we
talked about, just to add

01:01:16.330 --> 01:01:18.790
depth of flavor and some chewiness.

01:01:18.790 --> 01:01:23.934
Some melted, unsalted European style
butter, toasted off in the oven.

01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:28.670
Mini chocolate chips.

01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:30.920
We like to use mini
chocolate chips at Milk Bar.

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:35.240
I like fancy chocolate, but
I have the hardest time--

01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:37.380
I don't like to adulterate chocolate.

01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:39.620
I like chocolate-- I
feel like chocolate chips

01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:41.800
are meant for chocolate chip cookies.

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:44.940
And I feel really bad taking
really fancy chocolate

01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:46.850
and putting them into cookies.

01:01:46.850 --> 01:01:48.660
I also like mini chocolate chips.

01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:51.410
They distribute nice and
evenly, so you get a little bit

01:01:51.410 --> 01:01:53.210
of chocolate chip in every bite.

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:54.940
And mini marshmallows.

01:01:54.940 --> 01:02:01.944
And these just get mixed together until
they are a nice homogeneous mixture.

01:02:01.944 --> 01:02:02.860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:02:06.404 --> 01:02:08.070
CHRISTINA TOSI: That's a great question.

01:02:08.070 --> 01:02:12.650
So we have some cookie recipes
that we add glucose syrup to.

01:02:12.650 --> 01:02:19.175
Glucose syrup is sort of-- I earned it.

01:02:19.175 --> 01:02:19.954
It's good.

01:02:19.954 --> 01:02:20.620
Chef, it's good.

01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:27.180
We add glucose syrup to
some of our cookie recipes.

01:02:27.180 --> 01:02:30.520
My favorite cookie is fudgy in the
center and crispy on the outside,

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:32.280
like I mentioned before.

01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:36.410
Some cookies have a harder time,
depending on the makeup of them,

01:02:36.410 --> 01:02:41.139
they have a harder time
maintaining that fudgy center.

01:02:41.139 --> 01:02:43.430
Based on what we're mixing
in, based on the ingredients

01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:44.888
based on the makeup of the formula.

01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:49.810
So in my head I was
thinking, all right, well,

01:02:49.810 --> 01:02:53.720
how am I going to get this
cookie to be fudgy in the center.

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:58.320
And glucose syrup is sort of like
a less sweet version of corn syrup.

01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:03.050
It's less fluid so it's thicker
and it's not very sweet at all.

01:03:03.050 --> 01:03:07.945
And I thought well, glucose
syrup, if I put it in a recipe,

01:03:07.945 --> 01:03:09.820
it makes it seem like
it's going to be fudgy.

01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:14.810
It has almost fudgy, like
clear, fudgy quality to it.

01:03:14.810 --> 01:03:19.300
So we added it to the cookies
originally to keep them fudgy

01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:21.230
in the center and crispy on the outside.

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:24.020
And then we also realized that
when we were doing-- it worked,

01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:24.910
it worked great.

01:03:24.910 --> 01:03:29.860
We also realized when we were doing
that, that they also helped keep them

01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:34.710
fudgy in the center for a longer period
of time because of the makeup of what

01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:37.350
glucose is, which is pretty cool.

01:03:37.350 --> 01:03:41.840
The cool thing about glucose is
it has a very low water content.

01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:43.950
When you're mixing things
into a cookie dough,

01:03:43.950 --> 01:03:45.870
the thing that you
really don't want to do

01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:49.220
is add something that has a
high water content because it's

01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:52.240
going to make your cookies bake
off into almost like cakey,

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:54.786
cookie-- I don't like cakey cookies.

01:03:54.786 --> 01:03:57.320
I like fudgy in the center,
crispy on the outside cookies.

01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:00.920
And so glucose syrup is a cool
add-in to get the right texture,

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:07.690
but not to add such a water content that
it would sort of make the cookies puff

01:04:07.690 --> 01:04:09.980
or it would hydrate the
cookies in a way that they

01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:11.931
would puff into cakey cookies.

01:04:11.931 --> 01:04:12.847
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:04:16.115 --> 01:04:17.490
CHRISTINA TOSI: Oh, there she is.

01:04:17.490 --> 01:04:20.031
Sorry, I couldn't figure out
where the voice was coming from.

01:04:20.031 --> 01:04:24.020
Why do we use both baking powder and
baking soda and not one or the other?

01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:26.000
Part of it is flavor.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.940
I love the flavor that the
two of them bring together.

01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:34.300
In like a standard Toll House cookie
recipe, it just calls for baking soda.

01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:37.620
Baking powder, or baking powder that
you usually find in grocery stores

01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:42.040
is double acting, so it
acts, usually immediately,

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:43.570
when it's hydrated in a recipe.

01:04:43.570 --> 01:04:45.600
That usually happens
more on the cake end.

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:49.105
But then it also happens
again in the baking process.

01:04:49.105 --> 01:04:55.710
It provides-- it releases a gas,
which helps your baked good puff.

01:04:55.710 --> 01:05:00.390
Baking soda reacts the most when
there's an acid introduced to it.

01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:03.800
So in cakes, buttermilk, or lemon
juice or something like that.

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:08.240
So I like what baking soda
does from a flavor standpoint,

01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:12.690
but I find that the baking-- we put
baking powder in as well, because it

01:05:12.690 --> 01:05:15.490
helps give a little bit extra lift.

01:05:15.490 --> 01:05:17.770
And the way that we
bake our cookies, we'll

01:05:17.770 --> 01:05:21.660
bake them-- we almost underbake them
slightly so that you get that lift

01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:23.700
and you get that crispy top.

01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:26.580
But we underbake them just
slightly so that when they cool,

01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:28.760
there's still a fudgy
center and they almost

01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:31.080
sink into themselves just a little bit.

01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:33.640
So you get the crispy element,
but still the fudgy center.

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:38.390
So the baking soda is there for purpose,
but also because it's the flavor

01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:40.750
that you-- believe it or not,
I know you don't probably

01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:43.690
think about baking soda
being an awesome flavor.

01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:48.930
But it really does shape a
nuanced flavor of a cookie.

01:05:48.930 --> 01:05:51.530
And it's there for that reason
and for the leavening purpose.

01:05:51.530 --> 01:05:55.310
But we use baking powder as well to
get a little bit more of that height

01:05:55.310 --> 01:06:00.450
when it acts the second
time in a hot oven.

01:06:00.450 --> 01:06:04.520
OK, so these corn flake chocolate chip
marshmallow cookies are in the oven.

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:10.530
If we were at all worried about them,
we would take them-- in our kitchen,

01:06:10.530 --> 01:06:12.770
we'd scoop them and we refrigerate them.

01:06:12.770 --> 01:06:14.440
Sometimes we even freeze them.

01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:17.110
So we get the mixture
super, super, super, cold.

01:06:17.110 --> 01:06:20.680
Because what happens when you
bake room temperature butter,

01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:24.680
well, it starts to melt a lot quicker,
because room temperature is already

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:31.210
a lot warmer than butter that's come
out of a 40 or 41 degree refrigerator.

01:06:31.210 --> 01:06:35.560
So we usually take this cookie dough
and we refrigerate it in our kitchen.

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:38.740
That really helps seal
the deal and the bond

01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:41.950
that we made between the
butter, the sugar, and the egg.

01:06:41.950 --> 01:06:47.020
And it's an insurance plan so that the
second those cookies hit a hot oven,

01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:50.180
the butter doesn't want to
start-- the butter doesn't

01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:55.720
want to sort of break up with the
butters and the egg and bake out.

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.460
It allows the outside of
the cookie to bake first

01:06:58.460 --> 01:07:02.530
before the butter starts to melt down
and break down in the baking process.

01:07:02.530 --> 01:07:03.518
Yes.

01:07:03.518 --> 01:07:08.549
AUDIENCE: What temperature do your
have your kitchen [INAUDIBLE]?

01:07:08.549 --> 01:07:10.590
CHRISTINA TOSI: You're
going to love this answer.

01:07:10.590 --> 01:07:12.381
So the question was,
what temperature do we

01:07:12.381 --> 01:07:15.100
have our kitchen and our
refrigerator and our freezer?

01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:21.420
Our kitchen is whatever temperature
it happens to be at that time of year.

01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:23.910
We do not have central
heating or air conditioning,

01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:28.900
which anybody that's ever-- anybody out
there that's a baker, I want a standing

01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:33.010
round of applause for that, because that
is a gravity-- that is like a-- that

01:07:33.010 --> 01:07:37.640
is the largest accomplished--
creating baked goods

01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:42.010
in an un-temperature controlled kitchen
is a very difficult thing to do.

01:07:42.010 --> 01:07:48.400
Our refrigerator is usually live in
the 38 degree time, temperature range.

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:52.590
And our freezers, our
walk-in freezers, usually

01:07:52.590 --> 01:07:56.150
live between negative five,
usually negative 10 and zero,

01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:58.890
but usually largely in
the negative five zone.

01:07:58.890 --> 01:08:01.390
A lot of our units are
large units, so they always

01:08:01.390 --> 01:08:06.840
go into defrost time
once or twice a day.

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:08.950
And the temperature will
raise a few degrees.

01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:12.110
But we bake and an un-temperature
controlled environment.

01:08:12.110 --> 01:08:14.910
So there's no reason
why you can't get it

01:08:14.910 --> 01:08:19.210
done at home, Unless you also
have an temperature controlled

01:08:19.210 --> 01:08:21.510
kitchen in your home.

01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:25.630
OK so the cookies are going
to bake for about 10 minutes.

01:08:25.630 --> 01:08:31.000
We bake then at 350
in a convection oven.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.430
A convection oven is an oven
that has a large fan somewhere

01:08:35.430 --> 01:08:39.529
on one of its sides, above, below, that
helps distribute the heat of the oven,

01:08:39.529 --> 01:08:41.189
largely.

01:08:41.189 --> 01:08:43.550
Some of you might have a
convection oven at home.

01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:45.950
Some of you might have
a conventional oven.

01:08:45.950 --> 01:08:50.930
A conventional oven is an oven that
just has a heating element somewhere.

01:08:50.930 --> 01:08:53.529
My heating element is in
the bottom of my oven.

01:08:53.529 --> 01:08:58.040
It's just like almost like a
little-- you can see it heat up pink

01:08:58.040 --> 01:08:59.840
when it starts to get warm.

01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:03.910
I had a conventional oven
before that heated from the top.

01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:05.609
It's basically just like a hot box.

01:09:05.609 --> 01:09:07.859
There's no fan that's distributing heat.

01:09:07.859 --> 01:09:10.250
If you're baking in a
conventional oven, you

01:09:10.250 --> 01:09:15.930
want to bake and 25 degrees
lower than a convection oven.

01:09:15.930 --> 01:09:20.279
So if you're baking these cookies at
home, you want to bake them at 325.

01:09:20.279 --> 01:09:22.069
A lot of that is just heat distribution.

01:09:25.012 --> 01:09:26.970
All right, Jenna's going
to bake those cookies.

01:09:26.970 --> 01:09:29.710
And we're going make
chocolate chip cake.

01:09:29.710 --> 01:09:30.210
Yes.

01:09:30.210 --> 01:09:31.126
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:09:38.387 --> 01:09:39.220
CHRISTINA TOSI: Yes.

01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:42.399
So the question was,
have you played around

01:09:42.399 --> 01:09:44.479
with baking temperature for the cookies?

01:09:44.479 --> 01:09:47.600
We haven't played around with the
baking temperature of the cookies

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:52.160
too much from a textural standpoint
and to get just the right crispiness,

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:56.790
mostly because they came
out great the first time.

01:09:56.790 --> 01:09:58.336
Truth be told.

01:09:58.336 --> 01:09:59.460
We're in a safe place here.

01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:01.370
I'll just give it to you straight.

01:10:01.370 --> 01:10:07.320
We do bake in convection ovens than
are combi ovens and that are electric.

01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:11.820
So their sense of temperature and their
recovery time is incredibly acute.

01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:13.620
It's very, very accurate.

01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:17.476
When we open the door, the
recovery time is very, very short.

01:10:17.476 --> 01:10:18.600
That's part of the process.

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:23.120
When we bake the crack pie, the pie
that I showed you after the cereal milk,

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:26.760
because of the sugar in that
pie, the nature of that pie,

01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:31.650
we start the baking process at 350.

01:10:31.650 --> 01:10:37.020
But the top of the pie starts to-- the
sugars in the pier start to caramelize,

01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:40.470
so we actually turn down the
temperature to 325 to let

01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:42.580
the center of the pipe finish baking.

01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:46.662
So we do play around with
temperature, but with cookies.

01:10:46.662 --> 01:10:47.630
Yes, in the back.

01:10:47.630 --> 01:10:48.546
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:55.240
CHRISTINA TOSI: Yes, the armor.

01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:55.920
Say that again.

01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:57.160
AUDIENCE: Do you need the whites?

01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:59.118
CHRISTINA TOSI: That's
a really great question.

01:10:59.118 --> 01:11:00.800
Do we need the whites in the recipe?

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:05.880
We have not-- I have not tried
the recipe without egg whites.

01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:08.660
I do think the egg white in
the recipe does help provide

01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:11.970
a little bit of the lift in the cookie.

01:11:11.970 --> 01:11:15.680
An all egg yolk cookie
would be super, duper rich,

01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:20.970
I would say maybe if we were making
the cookie without the egg white,

01:11:20.970 --> 01:11:24.650
and just egg yolks, we'd need to
add either a little bit more egg

01:11:24.650 --> 01:11:27.790
yolk or a little bit less
flour, because the whites also

01:11:27.790 --> 01:11:31.840
provide a specific moisture
content that helps the formula.

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:38.190
" we chose to add just yolks, I might
almost think about taking away a little

01:11:38.190 --> 01:11:42.570
bit of the butter, not because I'm
worried about the sort of armor quality

01:11:42.570 --> 01:11:47.080
of egg yolks, but more just the
richness and the balance of flavor.

01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:51.940
Because there such a thing is
like too- too rich, too much.

01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:53.420
But that's a really good question.

01:11:53.420 --> 01:11:56.645
Jenna write it down.

01:11:56.645 --> 01:11:57.770
We're going to test it out.

01:11:57.770 --> 01:12:00.150
We'll be your cookie testers.

01:12:00.150 --> 01:12:01.330
OK, so chocolate chip cake.

01:12:01.330 --> 01:12:05.200
Have any of you had the
chocolate chip layer cake?

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:06.310
It's a sleeper.

01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:07.160
It's a sleeper.

01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:08.510
JENNA: Not in my world.

01:12:08.510 --> 01:12:12.340
CHRISTINA TOSI: Not in-- oh, none of
you exist in Jenna's world right now.

01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:13.690
You hurt her feelings.

01:12:13.690 --> 01:12:16.330
So we make these fun
layer cakes at Milk Bar.

01:12:16.330 --> 01:12:19.510
They all make 14 different
flavors of layer cake.

01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:21.930
And they all follow the same formula.

01:12:21.930 --> 01:12:25.230
One, they look funny.

01:12:25.230 --> 01:12:26.180
What happened here?

01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:27.780
Why isn't there anything there?

01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:30.780
We don't frost any of
the sides of the cake.

01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:32.300
I love cake.

01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:33.580
I love cake.

01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:37.610
More than cake, I really
love frosting, hands down,

01:12:37.610 --> 01:12:38.980
I could eat a tub of frosting.

01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:41.880
I think the thing that always
bothers me a little bit about cake

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:44.680
or before I decided that I
should do something about it

01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:48.300
instead of complaining
about it in my head,

01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:52.570
is that typically with cake, you
get cake, frosting, cake, frosting,

01:12:52.570 --> 01:12:53.300
cake, frosting.

01:12:53.300 --> 01:12:55.700
Or you just get get cake, frosting.

01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:59.400
And sometimes the cake's
dry, or the cake's fine.

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:00.069
It's just fine.

01:13:00.069 --> 01:13:02.360
When was the last time you
had a cake that was awesome.

01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:05.301
It's usually just fine, in a
layer cake capacity, right?

01:13:05.301 --> 01:13:07.550
I'm not talking about like
a flourless chocolate cake.

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:10.840
I'm talking about layer
cake, capacity cake.

01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:11.890
It's usually just fine.

01:13:11.890 --> 01:13:13.770
Sometimes it's dry.

01:13:13.770 --> 01:13:17.630
The frosting is almost always the best
part, but then it's also usually like,

01:13:17.630 --> 01:13:20.060
OK, maybe it's vanilla,
maybe it's chocolate,

01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:22.190
maybe it's lemon if you're lucky.

01:13:22.190 --> 01:13:25.217
There was never a lot of
flavor personality in cakes.

01:13:25.217 --> 01:13:27.050
And that always sort
of bummed me out, like,

01:13:27.050 --> 01:13:29.190
where's the perspective,
where's the point of view,

01:13:29.190 --> 01:13:30.840
where's the flavor and the texture?

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:32.670
Cake is also usually just soft, right?

01:13:32.670 --> 01:13:36.970
It's like soft cake, soft
frosting, soft cake, soft frosting.

01:13:36.970 --> 01:13:40.540
So I thought, OK, what is my-- just
m what's my cheesecake going to be,

01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:42.750
if I know I can't make
cheesecake, if I know

01:13:42.750 --> 01:13:47.240
I can't make apple pie, what is it
that I am going to make with it?

01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:49.830
So with cake, I thought,
OK, layer cakes.

01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:50.960
I can do that.

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:53.290
And I'm going to break it open.

01:13:53.290 --> 01:13:57.919
Why not question what can or
can't be a layer in a layer cake?

01:13:57.919 --> 01:13:59.460
Why does it just have to be frosting?

01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:03.530
How can I make fun flavors
of frosting and fun elements

01:14:03.530 --> 01:14:06.251
that could be layers in a layer cake.

01:14:06.251 --> 01:14:08.000
The one thing I didn't
share with you guys

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:13.880
is, I'm definitely a don't take yourself
so seriously person, but details,

01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:17.750
details, details, when
it really matters.

01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:20.060
I just am not fussy about cakes.

01:14:20.060 --> 01:14:21.810
I could never understand
going to culinary

01:14:21.810 --> 01:14:32.010
school-- I'd say 80% of my class were
obsessed with cakes, wedding cakes.

01:14:32.010 --> 01:14:34.010
And it was all about like,
OK, I'm going to make

01:14:34.010 --> 01:14:38.050
this kind of boring
cake frosting and then

01:14:38.050 --> 01:14:40.630
I'm going to drape some fondant over it.

01:14:40.630 --> 01:14:43.110
Like, I get it, it's beautiful.

01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:44.410
It's beautiful.

01:14:44.410 --> 01:14:46.880
But like, I went to
culinary school to eat

01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:54.090
and to learn how to feed you guys
to eat And so, I was like OK, OK.

01:14:54.090 --> 01:14:55.680
I'm not playing that game.

01:14:55.680 --> 01:15:01.470
I also just I don't have the capacity
to make something look perfect.

01:15:01.470 --> 01:15:03.910
I'm a very comfortably human person.

01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:06.640
Like I describe the Milk Bar
style as we're comfortably human.

01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:11.230
We are perfectly imperfect
and we're not going--

01:15:11.230 --> 01:15:15.759
I can't create a business based on cakes
that look perfect and don't taste good.

01:15:15.759 --> 01:15:17.300
It just doesn't make any sense to me.

01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:20.050
So I was like, I'm not going to
cover the sides, I'm not doing it.

01:15:20.050 --> 01:15:21.050
I'm not doing it.

01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:24.170
And if I'm going to take all
this time trying to figure out

01:15:24.170 --> 01:15:26.840
flavors of cake and flavors
of fillings and layers

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:31.190
and textures, why would I hide
it behind a bunch of frosting?

01:15:31.190 --> 01:15:35.730
I'm going to save the frosting and bring
it home with me and eat it after work

01:15:35.730 --> 01:15:39.110
and then we'll leave the cakes
to sort of speak for themselves.

01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:41.030
So all of our cakes
look a little like this.

01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:44.380
People call it naked, which makes
me feel uncomfortable personally.

01:15:44.380 --> 01:15:46.230
They're not naked, they're good.

01:15:46.230 --> 01:15:46.810
They're good.

01:15:46.810 --> 01:15:47.850
They are what they are.

01:15:47.850 --> 01:15:50.120
But so this is just a little
bit of a story of a layer cake.

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:51.703
I just don't want anyone to freak out.

01:15:51.703 --> 01:15:53.310
This is what they look like.

01:15:53.310 --> 01:15:55.920
14 different flavors,
they're all different colors.

01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:03.770
Each of them is meant to sort of draw
you into the flavors that are inside

01:16:03.770 --> 01:16:05.050
and layered up.

01:16:05.050 --> 01:16:08.722
So the cake batter, I think is
a really fun study in emulsions

01:16:08.722 --> 01:16:11.055
because it's all about bubbles
and it's all about space,

01:16:11.055 --> 01:16:13.100
so we'll talk about that.

01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:18.550
So it starts off, just like the cookies,
with unsalted European style butter.

01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:22.960
This cake, like I mentioned a little
bit earlier, is an American style cake.

01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:24.485
So it has a lot of fat it it.

01:16:24.485 --> 01:16:26.610
It's not a sponge cake,
it's not a foam cake,

01:16:26.610 --> 01:16:29.740
it's not based on a
egg whites or aeration.

01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:33.330
It gets its height from leaveners,
so baking powder and baking soda,

01:16:33.330 --> 01:16:36.774
just like the cookies, but in a
little bit larger of capacity.

01:16:36.774 --> 01:16:39.690
It also gets its height from eggs,
which we'll talk about in a second.

01:16:39.690 --> 01:16:43.400
So unsalted European style
butter, light brown sugar,

01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:48.160
granulated sugar, easy enough,

01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:51.610
This, we start the creaming process.

01:16:51.610 --> 01:16:57.420
It gets three large eggs, easy enough.

01:16:57.420 --> 01:16:59.080
Let's crack those here.

01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:00.250
And then vanilla extract.

01:17:00.250 --> 01:17:02.890
I don't know if you can see how much.

01:17:02.890 --> 01:17:05.310
There's a lot of vanilla
extract for a layer cake.

01:17:05.310 --> 01:17:11.490
But the layer cake itself is
chocolate chip layer cake.

01:17:11.490 --> 01:17:15.210
So we're making a chocolate
chip cake to start.

01:17:15.210 --> 01:17:17.670
And I want this chocolate
chip cake to taste almost

01:17:17.670 --> 01:17:20.420
like a chocolate chip cookie, so
I'm going to add a lot of vanilla

01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:22.170
extract to it.

01:17:22.170 --> 01:17:28.990
This cake itself is chocolate
chip, passion fruit, and coffee.

01:17:28.990 --> 01:17:32.760
And the inspiration
behind this cake is sort

01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:38.150
of a riff on a fancy pastry
chef triumvirate of flavors

01:17:38.150 --> 01:17:41.249
that is often used coffee,
chocolate, and passion fruit.

01:17:41.249 --> 01:17:43.790
If you think about if, they're
all bitter, they're all sweet,

01:17:43.790 --> 01:17:46.480
they're all floral.

01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:48.820
And so, I figured it would
be fun to make a layer

01:17:48.820 --> 01:17:54.110
cake in our fun, comfortably human way,
based off of very fancy pastry chef

01:17:54.110 --> 01:17:56.600
tastes and flavors.

01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:59.669
So the mixture gets creamed together.

01:17:59.669 --> 01:18:01.960
We're not creaming it the
way that we would the cookie.

01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:04.085
We're not going for the 10
minute creaming process,

01:18:04.085 --> 01:18:08.860
we're just looking to incorporate
the butter and the sugars together.

01:18:08.860 --> 01:18:13.190
I'm going to add the eggs
one by one into the mixture.

01:18:13.190 --> 01:18:17.762
I don't add one egg until the egg
before it has disappeared and dissipated

01:18:17.762 --> 01:18:18.470
into the mixture.

01:18:22.670 --> 01:18:23.520
Easy enough.

01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:27.330
Do any of you guys make
cakes from scratch at home?

01:18:27.330 --> 01:18:28.620
That's impressive.

01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:31.440
I was raised by women that love to bake.

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:35.410
The one thing I didn't
tell you is, I was never

01:18:35.410 --> 01:18:38.860
taught how to make a cake
from scratch in this capacity

01:18:38.860 --> 01:18:41.210
until-- not even actually
in culinary school.

01:18:41.210 --> 01:18:43.543
In culinary school, they teach
you how to make a genoise

01:18:43.543 --> 01:18:46.290
or a lot of these European style cakes.

01:18:46.290 --> 01:18:50.260
I had to figure out the American
style cake a little bit for myself.

01:18:50.260 --> 01:18:53.592
But I'm always impressed by those
that make cakes from scratch at home.

01:18:53.592 --> 01:18:54.300
I don't know why.

01:18:54.300 --> 01:18:55.540
It's not that hard.

01:18:55.540 --> 01:18:58.010
But I just never-- Sorry,
it's not that hard.

01:18:58.010 --> 01:18:59.300
Sorry.

01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:00.520
That wasn't nice.

01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:03.930
That wasn't nice.

01:19:03.930 --> 01:19:07.260
It's mind over matter, where
it's a very simple technique.

01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:11.610
But I think it shows just like
a capacity to get in there

01:19:11.610 --> 01:19:12.990
and get in the kitchen.

01:19:12.990 --> 01:19:17.500
And I just never, ever-- it always
seems like the most glamorous thing

01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:21.110
to do in your home kitchen
when I was growing up.

01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:26.080
So American style cake, we added
one egg, we added two eggs.

01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:29.690
After we add the second egg after the
first egg disappeared into the mixture.

01:19:29.690 --> 01:19:31.940
So after we are confident
that was well mixed,

01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:35.251
we're going to add this last egg
with a little bit of vanilla extract.

01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:44.770
At this point, the batter
is starting to get we,

01:19:44.770 --> 01:19:47.770
but we have a lot more
wet ingredients to add.

01:19:47.770 --> 01:19:50.020
We still have buttermilk
that we're going to add.

01:19:50.020 --> 01:19:53.330
And we still have grape seed
oil that we're going to add.

01:19:53.330 --> 01:19:56.930
The buttermilk that we're
adding is for flavor.

01:19:56.930 --> 01:20:01.310
It also has an acidity that will
help react with the baking soda

01:20:01.310 --> 01:20:05.460
later on in the recipe,
that'll help create

01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:08.404
those foamy bubbles and that
height that you get from cake.

01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:14.830
The problem with
buttermilk is when I add it

01:20:14.830 --> 01:20:20.200
in this stage, the butter and the
sugar and the eggs get really pissed.

01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:25.510
They don't want-- they do not want
the buttermilk in the mixture.

01:20:25.510 --> 01:20:27.600
But the buttermilk's got to go in.

01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:31.360
And buttermilk, we know,
is not an emulsifier.

01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:32.300
Wasn't on that list.

01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:37.660
It's not providing any sort of
armor, but we need it in the mixture.

01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:41.360
A lot of times in recipes, they'll
have you alternate wet and dry.

01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:44.490
So they'll have you alternate
buttermilk, flour, buttermilk, flour,

01:20:44.490 --> 01:20:45.446
buttermilk, flour.

01:20:45.446 --> 01:20:46.280
I can't.

01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:47.486
It's just, why?

01:20:47.486 --> 01:20:48.920
It's too much.

01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:49.685
It's too much.

01:20:49.685 --> 01:20:50.450
I don't feel like doing it.

01:20:50.450 --> 01:20:50.860
I don't want to do it.

01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:52.200
I don't feel like doing it.

01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:54.940
So what we do do, we still
have grape seed oil to add.

01:20:54.940 --> 01:20:55.589
It's too fussy.

01:20:55.589 --> 01:20:57.380
I don't like doing it,
so I'm not doing it.

01:20:57.380 --> 01:20:59.290
We don't do it at Milk Bar.

01:20:59.290 --> 01:21:01.390
We do have grape seed
oil that we need to add.

01:21:01.390 --> 01:21:05.320
We use grape seed oil and
canola oil, vegetable oil,

01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:07.610
an oil that is flavorless
and odorless, we'll

01:21:07.610 --> 01:21:12.400
do here unless you want the odor or the
flavor to incorporate into the cake.

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:15.560
So pumpkin seed oil, if you're
making pumpkin seed cake or olive

01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:17.860
oil, if you want olive oil cake.

01:21:17.860 --> 01:21:21.970
I start to add some of
the grape seed oil in,

01:21:21.970 --> 01:21:24.250
and the grape seed oil,
funnily enough, really

01:21:24.250 --> 01:21:28.730
helps the emulsification of
the batter at this point.

01:21:28.730 --> 01:21:34.240
It's like the social lubricant for
the party that's happening in here.

01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:37.770
If a cook adds too much
buttermilk, it just

01:21:37.770 --> 01:21:41.790
starts to look like a crazy separated
mass and my favorite thing to do

01:21:41.790 --> 01:21:45.360
is to walk over and start
pouring in the grape seed oil

01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:52.080
and letting the mixture go, because
it makes it look like miracle worker.

01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:53.030
All I did was add--

01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:57.230
So I'm just going to show you know how
crazy it looks right now because you

01:21:57.230 --> 01:22:00.000
get you guys are super
impressed when the grape see

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.700
oil comes into play a little bit more.

01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:03.330
You see that?

01:22:03.330 --> 01:22:04.250
It looks like it's curdled.

01:22:04.250 --> 01:22:05.660
It looks like I just made cheese.

01:22:05.660 --> 01:22:07.710
Let's get a little spotlight in here.

01:22:07.710 --> 01:22:11.222
Yeah OK, it;s not going to
look like that in a second.

01:22:11.222 --> 01:22:12.856
AUDIENCE: What does the buttermilk add?

01:22:12.856 --> 01:22:14.230
CHRISTINA TOSI: What does it add?

01:22:14.230 --> 01:22:15.590
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:22:15.590 --> 01:22:18.160
CHRISTINA TOSI: So if it adds
flavor, believe it or not.

01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:20.340
It's similar to the leaveners.

01:22:20.340 --> 01:22:21.990
That we add, where it will add flavor.

01:22:21.990 --> 01:22:27.110
It also adds the acidity that
baking soda needs to react properly

01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:30.267
in that leavening process.

01:22:30.267 --> 01:22:32.100
So I'm just going along
with the buttermilk.

01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:35.690
I'm sick of taking my time.

01:22:35.690 --> 01:22:39.546
And grape seed oil's coming
in so get ready, guys.

01:22:39.546 --> 01:22:40.950
It's about to happen.

01:22:45.630 --> 01:22:49.540
A European cake is usually
and largely egg-based.

01:22:49.540 --> 01:22:54.380
There's usually not a ton
of fat in a European cake.

01:22:54.380 --> 01:22:55.810
And it's usually very delicate.

01:22:55.810 --> 01:22:59.020
There's usually not baking powder and
baking soda in it to act as a leavener.

01:22:59.020 --> 01:23:02.340
You typically take egg whites
and you whip them up over here.

01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:07.530
If there even is egg yolks in the
recipe, you'll aerate them separately.

01:23:07.530 --> 01:23:09.490
You'll very delicately
incorporate the two

01:23:09.490 --> 01:23:11.031
so that you don't deflate the batter.

01:23:11.031 --> 01:23:13.470
Because you're really
depending on that height

01:23:13.470 --> 01:23:21.330
that you've established to maintain in
the baking process so that it keeps on.

01:23:21.330 --> 01:23:26.490
Every once in awhile you will fold in
a tablespoon or two of melted butter.

01:23:26.490 --> 01:23:27.420
You can't taste it.

01:23:27.420 --> 01:23:29.878
Why would you put butter in
something that you can't taste?

01:23:29.878 --> 01:23:30.770
I don't know.

01:23:30.770 --> 01:23:34.350
OK so, we're almost there.

01:23:34.350 --> 01:23:36.766
This is looking a little bit better.

01:23:36.766 --> 01:23:39.835
You guys see that?

01:23:39.835 --> 01:23:41.460
A little bit better, it's almost there.

01:23:41.460 --> 01:23:43.560
We're going to let it go
until it's nice and glossy.

01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:46.601
I'm going to let Jenna to take over
this, so I can ask you guys questions

01:23:46.601 --> 01:23:52.490
or you guys can ask me questions and not
be bored by watching grape seed oil go.

01:23:52.490 --> 01:23:52.990
Yes.

01:23:52.990 --> 01:23:53.340
MICHAEL BRENNER: Can I say something?

01:23:53.340 --> 01:23:54.130
So I've got to say this.

01:23:54.130 --> 01:23:54.670
CHRISTINA TOSI: Get in there.

01:23:54.670 --> 01:23:56.570
MICHAEL BRENNER: I've got to say this.

01:23:56.570 --> 01:23:56.920
CHRISTINA TOSI: Get in there.

01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:57.780
MICHAEL BRENNER: OK,
I'm allowed to say this.

01:23:57.780 --> 01:23:59.440
So, do you know what it is
with the grape seed oil?

01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:00.150
CHRISTINA TOSI: Tell me.

01:24:00.150 --> 01:24:02.066
MICHAEL BRENNER: It's a
volume fraction thing.

01:24:02.066 --> 01:24:05.958
CHRISTINA TOSI: Oh, slam
It's a volume fraction thing.

01:24:05.958 --> 01:24:09.380
MICHAEL BRENNER: Because you know,
it's the volume fraction of-- it's

01:24:09.380 --> 01:24:11.840
the volume-- I have my own mic.

01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:13.330
I don't think it works though.

01:24:13.330 --> 01:24:14.670
Does my mic work?

01:24:14.670 --> 01:24:18.920
So it's a volume fraction thing because
what matters, remember I told you 63%?

01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:20.380
Remember I told you 63%?

01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:23.060
CHRISTINA TOSI: I've got an
apron over here to prove it.

01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:23.410
MICHAEL BRENNER: You guys didn't know.

01:24:23.410 --> 01:24:25.743
That's going to be the question
next week, what percent.

01:24:25.743 --> 01:24:28.990
So if you calculate-- people should go
home-- I'm sure your recipe's online.

01:24:28.990 --> 01:24:29.610
CHRISTINA TOSI: Yeah, it is.

01:24:29.610 --> 01:24:31.100
MICHAEL BRENNER: So I'm sure
you could go and calculate

01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:33.950
the volume fraction of oil in
there and the buttermilk has water,

01:24:33.950 --> 01:24:36.003
so you've increased the amount
of water, so the volume fraction

01:24:36.003 --> 01:24:36.904
has gone way down.

01:24:36.904 --> 01:24:38.070
So you've got to push it up.

01:24:38.070 --> 01:24:38.870
CHRISTINA TOSI: You've
got to push it back up.

01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:40.640
MICHAEL BRENNER: And
it's going to go up 63%.

01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:41.130
Anyway--

01:24:41.130 --> 01:24:41.880
CHRISTINA TOSI: Volume fraction.

01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:43.500
MICHAEL BRENNER: Volume fraction.

01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:46.259
CHRISTINA TOSI: Homework for next week.

01:24:46.259 --> 01:24:48.050
I feel like as a
professor, you're not even

01:24:48.050 --> 01:24:51.120
supposed to tell them what they're
going to be tested on next week.

01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:53.750
You all got a free pass.

01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:54.670
63%.

01:24:54.670 --> 01:24:55.170
Yes.

01:24:55.170 --> 01:24:57.194
In the back.

01:24:57.194 --> 01:24:58.110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:25:00.104 --> 01:25:02.020
CHRISTINA TOSI: How do
we feel about macarons?

01:25:06.630 --> 01:25:09.150
I think they're delicious
when made properly.

01:25:09.150 --> 01:25:13.264
I think often times-- I think dessert,
in general, when made properly

01:25:13.264 --> 01:25:13.805
is delicious.

01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:22.010
It's hard, it's hard with
certain desserts that

01:25:22.010 --> 01:25:26.430
become so trendy that people
get so excited about them,

01:25:26.430 --> 01:25:31.020
that they forget technique
and nuance and they're

01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:34.750
supposed to have certain
texture and consistency.

01:25:34.750 --> 01:25:36.230
We don't make macarons.

01:25:36.230 --> 01:25:39.380
We don't make them for the same reason
that we don't make other things.

01:25:39.380 --> 01:25:41.980
I know that other people
are super excited about them

01:25:41.980 --> 01:25:50.840
and they often choose flavor or
inspiration over technique or end

01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:51.340
product.

01:25:51.340 --> 01:25:57.950
And I think that has largely made
macarons a tricky subject matter

01:25:57.950 --> 01:26:04.320
because people either love them
or they like to be haters on them.

01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:05.840
I love a delicious macaron.

01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:10.411
macarons are really, really difficult
to make and to make properly, but--

01:26:10.411 --> 01:26:11.327
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:26:11.327 --> 01:26:12.618
CHRISTINA TOSI: Say that again.

01:26:12.618 --> 01:26:14.190
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:26:14.190 --> 01:26:19.400
CHRISTINA TOSI: The technique
that I was raised and taught, was,

01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:21.760
after you go through
whipping the egg white,

01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:24.250
and after you delicately
fold in almond flower

01:26:24.250 --> 01:26:26.290
and so on, and after
you grind down the 10X

01:26:26.290 --> 01:26:31.320
and the almond flour together and push
it through a sieve and then fold it,

01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:36.240
and you go to pipe these macarons,
it's to let them sit for two hours,

01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:40.520
so that a very thin skin forms.

01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:46.560
And that skin forms because the
air is drying out the surface.

01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:54.510
Aside from the composition of the
recipe, that is the number one--

01:26:54.510 --> 01:26:59.320
that's how you can always
tell me a good macaron from--

01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:01.715
AUDIENCE: What about the
beating of the egg whites?

01:27:01.715 --> 01:27:02.194
CHRISTINA TOSI: Questionable.

01:27:02.194 --> 01:27:03.877
AUDIENCE: There is a breaking point?

01:27:03.877 --> 01:27:04.710
CHRISTINA TOSI: Yes.

01:27:04.710 --> 01:27:07.459
There's a breaking point, that's
the temperature of the egg white.

01:27:07.459 --> 01:27:12.450
It's how much sugar, salt you're adding
to help keep it stable and stiff.

01:27:12.450 --> 01:27:14.740
It also comes down to
how often you're folding

01:27:14.740 --> 01:27:19.260
in your 10X and your almond flour
that have been ground together

01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:20.855
and sieved out.

01:27:25.010 --> 01:27:29.550
So many factors that could
be a success or a failure.

01:27:29.550 --> 01:27:35.980
I love them but it bums me
out when someone calls--

01:27:35.980 --> 01:27:38.469
I learned in culinary school--

01:27:38.469 --> 01:27:40.760
I learned many things, but
one of my favorite takeaways

01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:44.600
was when you have
something on your menu,

01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:47.480
you're making a promise
to your customers.

01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:51.156
So if you're going to
call something ice cream,

01:27:51.156 --> 01:27:52.786
it damn well better be ice cream.

01:27:52.786 --> 01:27:55.160
Or if you're going to call
something a cake, of if you're

01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:58.210
going to call something a pie, or
if you call something a macaron,

01:27:58.210 --> 01:27:59.450
that's what it needs to be.

01:27:59.450 --> 01:28:02.755
It can't just be like your best attempt
at it or your kind of attempt at it.

01:28:02.755 --> 01:28:04.960
If you're going to call it something,
you're making that promise.

01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:06.180
You're creating that expectation.

01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:09.179
There's nothing worse than when you
order like a dessert at a restaurant

01:28:09.179 --> 01:28:12.050
and you're like, I thought it was
going to be something different

01:28:12.050 --> 01:28:14.794
because the menu said it was something.

01:28:14.794 --> 01:28:17.710
And I think sometimes that's what
happens with macarons because people

01:28:17.710 --> 01:28:24.090
get so excited about the
potential enthusiasm behind them

01:28:24.090 --> 01:28:29.820
that they forget that they
also have to be macarons.

01:28:29.820 --> 01:28:30.760
How are we looking?

01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:31.570
JENNA: Good.

01:28:31.570 --> 01:28:32.850
CHRISTINA TOSI: OK.

01:28:32.850 --> 01:28:34.380
Nice and glossy.

01:28:34.380 --> 01:28:37.280
Look at that, volume fracture.

01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:40.490
Coming back up.

01:28:40.490 --> 01:28:42.490
Buttermilk has been saved.

01:28:42.490 --> 01:28:45.385
JENNA: You're getting an A plus.

01:28:45.385 --> 01:28:45.885
Now, teach.

01:28:48.888 --> 01:28:51.310
CHRISTINA TOSI: So, it's
dry ingredient time.

01:28:51.310 --> 01:28:53.520
We're going to add cake flour.

01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:56.290
We're going to add kosher salt.

01:28:56.290 --> 01:28:58.610
We're going to add baking
powder and baking soda.

01:28:58.610 --> 01:29:02.090
Same reason, but different reasons
for the baking powder and baking

01:29:02.090 --> 01:29:03.910
soda in this recipe.

01:29:03.910 --> 01:29:06.700
For leavening, for
height, the baking powder

01:29:06.700 --> 01:29:09.850
is going to start to react
when we add it to this mixture.

01:29:09.850 --> 01:29:14.300
The baking soda and the baking
powder in its second iteration

01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:18.400
will react when they hit the
oven, the baking soda when

01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:21.690
it hits the acidity of the
buttermilk, the baking powder when it

01:29:21.690 --> 01:29:24.467
hits the heat the oven a second time.

01:29:24.467 --> 01:29:26.800
I'm going to let Jenna take
this away and look at these.

01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:30.865
Oh, did you guys see these, by chance?

01:29:30.865 --> 01:29:32.990
We're going to give those
away at the end of class.

01:29:32.990 --> 01:29:34.930
So I hope you guys
were paying attention.

01:29:34.930 --> 01:29:36.556
JENNA: I'm just adding a little slower.

01:29:36.556 --> 01:29:37.346
CHRISTINA TOSI: OK.

01:29:37.346 --> 01:29:39.460
So Jenna's adding the
dry ingredients and then

01:29:39.460 --> 01:29:44.047
she's going to add-- she's
going to paddle them together.

01:29:44.047 --> 01:29:45.630
We're going to get the cake baked off.

01:29:48.477 --> 01:29:50.060
What other questions do you guys have?

01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:50.974
Yes, in the back.

01:29:50.974 --> 01:29:51.890
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:29:57.470 --> 01:30:00.154
CHRISTINA TOSI: In the
supermarket, we get--

01:30:00.154 --> 01:30:01.300
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:03.133
CHRISTINA TOSI: Double
acting baking powder.

01:30:03.133 --> 01:30:09.010
Double acting baking powder is
probably the most common baking powder

01:30:09.010 --> 01:30:11.280
that you find in grocery stores.

01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:15.690
Single acting, I think still
exits, but not so frequently.

01:30:15.690 --> 01:30:20.940
Single acting baking powder only
acts when it hits and hydrates.

01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:23.630
It doesn't react again in the oven.

01:30:23.630 --> 01:30:26.000
And the reason they created
double acting baking powder

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:30.330
was because if it only reacts
once when it hits the mixture,

01:30:30.330 --> 01:30:34.595
it means like Jenna's going way too
slow for single acting baking powder.

01:30:37.725 --> 01:30:40.620
Like, you got to hit it in the
batter and get it in the oven

01:30:40.620 --> 01:30:44.020
because that's the only opportunity
you have for that baking powder

01:30:44.020 --> 01:30:47.685
to release the carbon dioxide to
create those big gas and the tunneling

01:30:47.685 --> 01:30:49.986
that you get and the height
that you get in cakes.

01:30:49.986 --> 01:30:50.486
Yes.

01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:56.860
MICHAEL BRENNER: Let's try
to mics, because otherwise--

01:30:56.860 --> 01:30:58.610
AUDIENCE: According
to your book, you seem

01:30:58.610 --> 01:31:01.780
to be a very big fan of American
butter cream frostings as opposed

01:31:01.780 --> 01:31:04.050
to look like a baked frosting
or a European frosting.

01:31:04.050 --> 01:31:04.925
CHRISTINA TOSI: Yeah.

01:31:04.925 --> 01:31:05.800
AUDIENCE: Can you talk about why?

01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:06.675
CHRISTINA TOSI: Yeah.

01:31:06.675 --> 01:31:13.550
We have-- What's the
best way to put this?

01:31:13.550 --> 01:31:20.340
I clearly had an issue with the
cake unit of culinary school.

01:31:20.340 --> 01:31:24.620
There was this huge lead up
to the butter cream unit,

01:31:24.620 --> 01:31:27.500
like you are going to go crazy
when you have this frosting.

01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:30.920
It;s the best frosting you've
ever had before in your life.

01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:36.175
And I just-- it was so
complicated and over the top

01:31:36.175 --> 01:31:38.052
and it didn't taste that great.

01:31:38.052 --> 01:31:39.010
I mean it tasted great.

01:31:39.010 --> 01:31:41.380
There's butter in it, there's
sugar in it, it's fine.

01:31:41.380 --> 01:31:44.960
But it was so tricky and it seems
so froufrou in a way that was like,

01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:48.440
OK, well, you have to bring your
sugar to the right temperature.

01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:51.760
And then you have to pour
it into your whipping egg

01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:53.800
whites that have to be just so.

01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:58.030
And then you have to add your
butter chunk by chunk by chunk

01:31:58.030 --> 01:31:59.050
until it dissipates.

01:31:59.050 --> 01:32:02.020
And I just thought, like, I know
how to make icing taste good.

01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:04.280
I've been eating it all my life.

01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:11.500
And I just-- also the nuance
of a European style buttercream

01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:14.380
is harder to get additional flavors in.

01:32:14.380 --> 01:32:17.110
And we're going to make
coffee frosting next,

01:32:17.110 --> 01:32:20.660
which is one of my most favorite
things to make because it's simple,

01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:24.220
but also to really help
explain emulsifications

01:32:24.220 --> 01:32:27.420
and how they affect
what I do for a living.

01:32:27.420 --> 01:32:31.550
I just didn't like the parameters and
the makeup of a European style butter

01:32:31.550 --> 01:32:32.050
cream.

01:32:32.050 --> 01:32:33.630
I didn't like the fussiness of it.

01:32:33.630 --> 01:32:37.360
There were way too many pitfalls in
the process and it was too fussy.

01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:39.940
And I also found that
because of the makeup of it,

01:32:39.940 --> 01:32:41.660
it's really easy to break down.

01:32:41.660 --> 01:32:45.660
It's really hard to make the day before
and then bringing it back to life

01:32:45.660 --> 01:32:48.730
takes almost as much
effort and then trying

01:32:48.730 --> 01:32:53.740
to get other flavors into it
became very, very, very difficult

01:32:53.740 --> 01:32:55.890
and I just thought, get rid of this.

01:32:55.890 --> 01:32:59.420
I can make frosting and
butter cream on my own.

01:32:59.420 --> 01:33:01.970
So we are going to make-
I'll show you guys-

01:33:01.970 --> 01:33:07.290
and I was raised by this funny
mom that loved to make box cake

01:33:07.290 --> 01:33:11.660
and I was raised by grandmothers
and they made frosting one way.

01:33:11.660 --> 01:33:16.210
And honestly, that is the way
that we make frosting today.

01:33:16.210 --> 01:33:17.900
We don't make boiled frosting.

01:33:17.900 --> 01:33:21.190
We don't make anything
other than this frosting.

01:33:21.190 --> 01:33:27.610
It's really simple and it's really
easy to alter the flavors of it.

01:33:27.610 --> 01:33:31.510
It's butter, unsalted
European style butter.

01:33:31.510 --> 01:33:34.940
It's confectioner's sugar.

01:33:34.940 --> 01:33:41.690
We paddle those two suckers together
until the butter has broken down

01:33:41.690 --> 01:33:46.590
and we're going to make this
frosting in a coffee frosting.

01:33:46.590 --> 01:33:51.330
When we are creating
recipes and we're trying

01:33:51.330 --> 01:33:56.300
to figure out what flavor we want in
what vehicle, so in this case, coffee

01:33:56.300 --> 01:33:59.800
into a frosting, we have so many
decisions we have to think about.

01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:03.240
One, what type of frosting
do we want to make?

01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:06.380
Inevitably, it comes back
to this very simple style

01:34:06.380 --> 01:34:11.440
of frosting and how are we
going to get the flavor in?

01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:16.290
So when you think about coffee, I could
skin this cat so many different ways.

01:34:16.290 --> 01:34:21.080
I can just add coffee, but
coffee is largely water-based.

01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:25.300
So it's going to alter my volume.

01:34:25.300 --> 01:34:27.355
It's going to plummet
my volume fraction.

01:34:27.355 --> 01:34:29.230
MICHAEL BRENNER: Plummet
the volume fraction.

01:34:29.230 --> 01:34:30.600
CHRISTINA TOSI: It's not good.

01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:31.558
It's going to separate.

01:34:31.558 --> 01:34:32.880
It's not going to emulsify.

01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:33.588
This is not good.

01:34:33.588 --> 01:34:36.311
No one wants an unemulsified frosting.

01:34:36.311 --> 01:34:37.686
Can you hand me one more spatula?

01:34:37.686 --> 01:34:39.470
JENNA: Yeah, of course.

01:34:39.470 --> 01:34:40.950
CHRISTINA TOSI: I can add espresso.

01:34:40.950 --> 01:34:41.740
Espresso works.

01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:43.820
Espresso is a little bit
bitter and I don't know.

01:34:43.820 --> 01:34:45.770
I don't want it to taste like espresso.

01:34:45.770 --> 01:34:51.110
I want it to taste like coffee,
I could-- what else could I do?

01:34:51.110 --> 01:34:55.049
I could melt the butter and
try and brew coffee through it

01:34:55.049 --> 01:34:56.840
or try and do like a
pour over with coffee.

01:34:56.840 --> 01:35:00.740
I start going in all these
places of like how can I do it?

01:35:00.740 --> 01:35:04.670
We tested so many different
recipes for coffee frosting

01:35:04.670 --> 01:35:14.950
and we ended up taking whole milk,
instant coffee, and some kosher salt,

01:35:14.950 --> 01:35:21.010
and the instant coffee really allows
you to get a depth of flavor in there

01:35:21.010 --> 01:35:25.770
without having to add too much milk.

01:35:25.770 --> 01:35:30.560
So you can really, really
control the depth of flavor

01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:35.440
against the amount of
milk but you're adding in.

01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:37.370
Now, the hardest part
about creating something

01:35:37.370 --> 01:35:39.411
is it's really easy to
dream up an idea, but it's

01:35:39.411 --> 01:35:42.380
really hard to make it into a reality.

01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:50.890
I'm going to let you
finish while I talk.

01:35:50.890 --> 01:35:54.130
And the hardest part about
something like this coffee frosting

01:35:54.130 --> 01:35:58.010
is I know I need to add
coffee in some degree.

01:35:58.010 --> 01:36:04.110
The instant coffee really needs
the milk to dissolve itself, right?

01:36:04.110 --> 01:36:06.160
Maybe some of you eat
instant coffee granules,

01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:10.000
but I don't-- I want it to be smooth,
and I want it to have the flavor

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:10.520
of coffee.

01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:14.690
So I can't just paddle
instant coffee into my butter.

01:36:14.690 --> 01:36:19.860
I need enough liquid to hydrate that
instant coffee into a coffee flavor.

01:36:19.860 --> 01:36:23.510
But I also know that I only
have a certain allowance

01:36:23.510 --> 01:36:26.880
for the amount of liquid that I can
add into this frosting before it breaks

01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:28.760
and it separates.

01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:32.920
And this coffee frosting like
literally comes right up to the line,

01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:40.630
in terms of keeping that emulsification
intact and separating it out.

01:36:40.630 --> 01:36:44.400
And that is the hardest
part of the job, where

01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:46.520
it's like knowing when to say when.

01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:50.600
I wish that more of
us took these classes

01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:53.880
to be able to be able to
really calculate the math

01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:55.970
and understand-- we
understand why it's happening.

01:36:55.970 --> 01:36:58.053
We understood how it's
happening, but sometimes we

01:36:58.053 --> 01:37:03.510
don't understand what the like, what
the very, very, very, very, very--

01:37:03.510 --> 01:37:05.790
what the tipping point
is and what amount we

01:37:05.790 --> 01:37:08.530
can add before it tips over and so on.

01:37:08.530 --> 01:37:10.850
And that's the coolest
part of the job too,

01:37:10.850 --> 01:37:14.724
is sort of getting to learn about the
scientific process through something

01:37:14.724 --> 01:37:16.890
as simple as like, I want
to make a coffee frosting,

01:37:16.890 --> 01:37:21.030
but it needs to be able to be
smooth enough to spread and so on.

01:37:24.294 --> 01:37:24.960
Coffee frosting.

01:37:27.915 --> 01:37:29.165
How are we looking over there?

01:37:29.165 --> 01:37:29.490
Are we good?

01:37:29.490 --> 01:37:30.489
Are we making it happen?

01:37:30.489 --> 01:37:32.700
JENNA: Yeah, we're making it happen.

01:37:32.700 --> 01:37:37.320
CHRISTINA TOSI: But
frosting is one-- frosting

01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:43.095
is one of those funny things where it
really is all about-- unless you just

01:37:43.095 --> 01:37:46.220
want your frosting to taste like butter
and sugar, which is what we have in

01:37:46.220 --> 01:37:49.920
here, you really have to figure
out how you're going to get

01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:53.660
that sucker to emulsify and what you're
adding in it, and how you're adding it,

01:37:53.660 --> 01:37:56.000
to really tell the flavor
story that you want.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:00.180
So it's sort of like
maintaining your imagination,

01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:03.500
but also understanding what
is and what isn't possible,

01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:05.220
and why it is or isn't possible.

01:38:05.220 --> 01:38:07.890
And understanding all
the different vehicles

01:38:07.890 --> 01:38:12.910
that you can bring that
flavor into the picture

01:38:12.910 --> 01:38:15.100
and how you're going
to get maximum flavor

01:38:15.100 --> 01:38:23.655
for the consistency and the texture
that you want your end product to be.

01:38:23.655 --> 01:38:24.155
Yes.

01:38:24.155 --> 01:38:27.480
AUDIENCE: I have a question about
one of your other frostings.

01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:30.340
I don't know if you
consider it frosting,

01:38:30.340 --> 01:38:33.170
but I had the opportunity
to try your popcorn cake.

01:38:33.170 --> 01:38:36.130
And it was amazing.

01:38:36.130 --> 01:38:39.132
I'm wondering what the
corn fudge is and how

01:38:39.132 --> 01:38:41.090
that that's made if you
want to go into detail.

01:38:41.090 --> 01:38:42.000
I would love that.

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:42.875
CHRISTINA TOSI: Sure.

01:38:42.875 --> 01:38:47.610
So, we have a cake on
the menu at Momofuku Ssam

01:38:47.610 --> 01:38:51.400
Bar that is a popcorn cake.

01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:56.330
It was born entirely from
inspiration at the movie theater.

01:38:56.330 --> 01:39:01.024
And we make the cake itself by
challenging what a flour can be

01:39:01.024 --> 01:39:02.940
or challenging what
starch in a recipe can be.

01:39:02.940 --> 01:39:07.250
We basically take popcorn and we
grind it down, popped popcorn,

01:39:07.250 --> 01:39:11.820
and we grind it down into
what we call a flour,

01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:15.050
and then we pass it
through a sieve or a tami,

01:39:15.050 --> 01:39:18.887
to sort of keep some of the kernels up
and try and create a flour out of it.

01:39:18.887 --> 01:39:20.220
We do that with a lot of things.

01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:21.178
We do it with pretzels.

01:39:21.178 --> 01:39:23.860
We do it with anything
that can grind down,

01:39:23.860 --> 01:39:29.530
we'll use as a partial flour replacement
to really get that flavor in.

01:39:29.530 --> 01:39:33.490
One of the layers of the cake-- so we
don't only make cakes with frosting.

01:39:33.490 --> 01:39:36.240
Some of our cakes, or a lot of our
cakes don't even have frosting.

01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:40.600
We'll use curds, we'll use
jams, we'll use jellies.

01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:46.610
We'll use, in this case,
what we call a popcorn fudge.

01:39:46.610 --> 01:39:52.610
The popcorn fudge is very much
like a ganache, in that it's

01:39:52.610 --> 01:39:54.150
a white chocolate based.

01:39:54.150 --> 01:39:55.966
A ganache is just
typically chocolate-based

01:39:55.966 --> 01:39:57.090
and there's some fat in it.

01:39:57.090 --> 01:40:01.450
So you're almost making like a
pliable or spreadable chocolate.

01:40:01.450 --> 01:40:03.060
We take white chocolate.

01:40:03.060 --> 01:40:03.560
We--

01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:07.780
JENNA: Sorry.

01:40:07.780 --> 01:40:09.619
CHRISTINA TOSI: She gets so distracted.

01:40:09.619 --> 01:40:12.910
Did you guys hear me ask her to help me
and then she was like, I'm out of here.

01:40:16.380 --> 01:40:21.770
We make a fudge or a ganache
with white chocolate and butter.

01:40:21.770 --> 01:40:24.820
We add some of that popcorn.

01:40:24.820 --> 01:40:29.150
We actually take some of the popcorn
and we blend it with heavy cream.

01:40:29.150 --> 01:40:31.710
So we make like a popcorn
flavored heavy cream.

01:40:31.710 --> 01:40:32.320
We blend it.

01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:32.910
We strain it.

01:40:32.910 --> 01:40:37.830
Because we don't want the mouth feel of
the popcorn, we just want the flavor.

01:40:37.830 --> 01:40:42.170
And where you would typically
put heavy cream in the recipe,

01:40:42.170 --> 01:40:44.950
we put this popcorn cream.

01:40:44.950 --> 01:40:47.500
And we make this popcorn
fudge or popcorn ganache.

01:40:47.500 --> 01:40:52.670
So that's very similar to the
cereal milk theory, right?

01:40:52.670 --> 01:40:56.770
It's like I know how to make this
flavored milk, and in this case,

01:40:56.770 --> 01:41:00.070
it's popcorn milk or
popcorn heavy cream.

01:41:00.070 --> 01:41:04.106
And where can I put it in
a recipe that is subtle,

01:41:04.106 --> 01:41:06.480
the recipe itself is subtle
enough that it's just waiting

01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:09.080
for flavor to come in this vehicle.

01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:11.020
In this case, it's heavy cream.

01:41:11.020 --> 01:41:11.963
Popcorn fudge.

01:41:11.963 --> 01:41:12.462
Yes.

01:41:15.444 --> 01:41:17.860
AUDIENCE: Birthday cake truffles
are my personal favorite.

01:41:17.860 --> 01:41:22.260
How did you create those and
any other history around those.

01:41:22.260 --> 01:41:26.640
CHRISTINA TOSI: We make a birthday
layer cake, which is on the first slide

01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:28.590
that I showed before we
got into cereal milk.

01:41:28.590 --> 01:41:32.070
The birthday layer cake and therefore
the corresponding birthday truffles

01:41:32.070 --> 01:41:36.690
are born from the box
cake mix of my childhood.

01:41:36.690 --> 01:41:40.790
My mother always made funfetti
box cake and she topped it

01:41:40.790 --> 01:41:45.140
with that sort of like tub, that
shelf stable tub of frosting,

01:41:45.140 --> 01:41:49.155
that had little rainbow bits in it.

01:41:49.155 --> 01:41:52.510
It took us two years
to develop that recipe.

01:41:52.510 --> 01:41:54.330
I know it sounds crazy.

01:41:54.330 --> 01:41:57.307
Because we could get it very,
very close and almost just right.

01:41:57.307 --> 01:41:59.140
But when we would do a
side by side tasting,

01:41:59.140 --> 01:42:00.880
we could never quite get there.

01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:05.190
We learned that clear vanilla
extract, which does not naturally

01:42:05.190 --> 01:42:10.950
occur in this environment, was the
secret in place of your standard,

01:42:10.950 --> 01:42:13.710
like darker Tahitian vanilla extract.

01:42:13.710 --> 01:42:18.270
And we also found that things
like citric acid and baking powder

01:42:18.270 --> 01:42:22.350
in the frosting were
nuances that we found

01:42:22.350 --> 01:42:24.660
by looking at the back
of the box of cake

01:42:24.660 --> 01:42:30.770
and the back of the box of
frosting, that brought flavor

01:42:30.770 --> 01:42:37.320
in ways, in little nuances of flavor
that we would have never expected.

01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:40.710
So for every layer cake that
we make, we make cake truffles,

01:42:40.710 --> 01:42:42.630
which are little bites of cake.

01:42:42.630 --> 01:42:48.820
And I will sort of show you when I cut
this cake-- this is our chocolate chip

01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:52.000
cake here.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:55.032
I'm just going to give you
guys a little look see.

01:42:55.032 --> 01:42:57.365
We made it for you ahead of
time just so you didn't have

01:42:57.365 --> 01:42:59.750
to wait for the real thing to bake.

01:42:59.750 --> 01:43:02.576
We make these layer cakes--
we bake all of our cakes

01:43:02.576 --> 01:43:04.450
in pans like this,
whether it's birthday cake

01:43:04.450 --> 01:43:06.697
or whether it's chocolate
chocolate chip cake.

01:43:06.697 --> 01:43:08.780
So that we have a nice
even bake across the board.

01:43:08.780 --> 01:43:10.696
The other thing that
bummed me out about cakes

01:43:10.696 --> 01:43:14.970
was that when you go to bake them
in a traditional round cake pan,

01:43:14.970 --> 01:43:18.760
you pour all the batter in, sometimes
you even pour it across three,

01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:26.240
but the problem when you're sitting in
a metal or aluminum of some sort tin,

01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:28.610
is that you get weird heat conductivity.

01:43:28.610 --> 01:43:31.240
And depending on how much
you're baking, you're

01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:33.780
getting cake that's
overbaked on the outside

01:43:33.780 --> 01:43:35.460
so that's perfectly baked in the center.

01:43:35.460 --> 01:43:37.790
Or you're getting cake that's
underbaked in the center

01:43:37.790 --> 01:43:40.080
to be perfectly based on the outside.

01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:43.320
So we got smart and said, well,
what if I just take the cake batter

01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:46.030
and pour it into a sheet
pan and bake it like that?

01:43:46.030 --> 01:43:49.050
That's how I know I can get the
most even consistent bake of cake.

01:43:49.050 --> 01:43:51.760
The only problem is that you
get this rectangular cake

01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:54.110
and you're trying to
make this and you're

01:43:54.110 --> 01:43:56.250
trying to make it into a six inch round.

01:43:56.250 --> 01:44:01.680
So when we make this cake, we punch
out the rounds of cake that we need.

01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:12.200
One, two, and the third round we
piece together with two halves.

01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:17.440
But what happens after the fact is,
I have all this delicious cakes scrap

01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:21.340
left over and it's still good.

01:44:21.340 --> 01:44:22.330
It's still servable.

01:44:22.330 --> 01:44:26.020
But I have but every
time I make a layer cake.

01:44:26.020 --> 01:44:29.160
So to make the birthday cake truffle
or the chocolate chip cake truffle,

01:44:29.160 --> 01:44:34.060
we take the scraps from the layer
cakes, and we mix them together

01:44:34.060 --> 01:44:40.370
with a liquid that we
choose that has flavor

01:44:40.370 --> 01:44:44.160
and that's going to add to the
flavor profile of the layer cake

01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:47.520
and therefore the cake truffles.

01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:52.320
In chocolate chip cakes,
it's passion fruit puree.

01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:55.200
This is also what we use to
soak the layer cake with.

01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:57.440
So we bind these cake scraps together.

01:44:57.440 --> 01:45:00.040
For a birthday cake, we take
the birthday cake scrap,

01:45:00.040 --> 01:45:02.429
we bind it together with
a vanilla scented milk.

01:45:02.429 --> 01:45:04.720
So we take some whole milk
and mix it with a little bit

01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:08.210
of that clear vanilla extract that
we found was the secret weapon.

01:45:08.210 --> 01:45:12.280
Bind it together, roll it
into fudgy little cake balls,

01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:17.810
and then we toss that in a thin
layer of melted white chocolate.

01:45:17.810 --> 01:45:21.590
That acts as a glue for
the outer coating which

01:45:21.590 --> 01:45:27.540
is just a sandier version of the
cake that we call birthday sand.

01:45:27.540 --> 01:45:31.780
And that, melted white chocolate
layer, it acts as a glue,

01:45:31.780 --> 01:45:37.330
but when it sets up, when it's
chills out and it changes its phase,

01:45:37.330 --> 01:45:40.900
it creates a freshness and
a shell and a freshness seal

01:45:40.900 --> 01:45:44.160
to keep the inside of the chocolate
cake truffle or the birthday cake

01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:49.070
truffle, nice and fudgy and in the
birthday cake case, vanilla scented.

01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:07.530
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
--with brown butter.

01:46:07.530 --> 01:46:12.550
And so when you make it any like
baked good with brown butter,

01:46:12.550 --> 01:46:17.730
you're melting the butter and thus
breaking the emulsion into the milk

01:46:17.730 --> 01:46:21.000
solids and the butter fat.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.960
So I was wondering how you
combat like creaming method.

01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:27.080
Do you like switch over
to quick bread method

01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:30.620
or like how do you usually combat that?

01:46:30.620 --> 01:46:34.210
CHRISTINA TOSI: When we make
cakes or cookies or something

01:46:34.210 --> 01:46:39.140
that we add brown butter to,
because brown butter is butter

01:46:39.140 --> 01:46:41.200
that's literally browned in a pan.

01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:43.770
And browned is probably
a generous description.

01:46:43.770 --> 01:46:44.320
It's burned.

01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:51.210
And you have to burn it to bring out
the nuttiness of the caramelized milk

01:46:51.210 --> 01:46:51.710
solids.

01:46:51.710 --> 01:46:54.130
That's sort of what you get
when you get brown butter.

01:46:54.130 --> 01:46:58.580
But when you do that, you are
changing the makeup of butter.

01:46:58.580 --> 01:47:01.950
Typically you do it as well all the
water content in butter goes away.

01:47:01.950 --> 01:47:04.900
It evaporates it in
the browning process.

01:47:04.900 --> 01:47:11.230
When we make recipes with brown butter,
we don't just use a one for one.

01:47:11.230 --> 01:47:14.730
Like OK, well, if I'm using two
sticks of butter and I'm browning it,

01:47:14.730 --> 01:47:19.120
then I'm just going to use those two
sticks in my corn flake chocolate chip

01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:19.980
cookie recipe.

01:47:19.980 --> 01:47:21.780
What we do is we'll
take that brown butter

01:47:21.780 --> 01:47:26.980
and we take it further than
you maybe you might imagine.

01:47:26.980 --> 01:47:29.870
Like it's burned, it's burned
to the bottom of your pan.

01:47:29.870 --> 01:47:34.080
And then we have a
different ratio-- we then

01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:39.100
also use regular butter in the recipe
whether it's a cookie or cake or a pie

01:47:39.100 --> 01:47:45.120
and we start the process just as though
brown butter was an additional add

01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:47.560
in later in the process.

01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:50.500
And we add those sort of brown
butter bits as flavoring elements.

01:47:50.500 --> 01:47:52.940
They certainly still have
a fat content to them.

01:47:52.940 --> 01:47:54.870
So the formula is different.

01:47:54.870 --> 01:47:59.590
We wouldn't just take it and add
it into the chocolate chip cake

01:47:59.590 --> 01:48:01.020
batter in the same way.

01:48:01.020 --> 01:48:05.900
But we don't treat it as
though it is butter, even

01:48:05.900 --> 01:48:08.320
though it's butter in a different form.

01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:10.020
And that's the secret I've learned.

01:48:10.020 --> 01:48:14.430
I have worked for pastry chefs that
made brown butter cake or this or that,

01:48:14.430 --> 01:48:18.580
and it never came out the same,
because they were basing the butter

01:48:18.580 --> 01:48:20.960
content of the recipe
off of brown butter,

01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:22.840
and depending on who
made the brown butter,

01:48:22.840 --> 01:48:26.610
you're taking it further or less
far and so it's makeup changes,

01:48:26.610 --> 01:48:28.540
and we'd always get an
inconsistent product.

01:48:28.540 --> 01:48:32.860
So we started treating it at Milk Bar
as almost like an add in ingredient.

01:48:32.860 --> 01:48:34.620
And we'd burn it, we'd take it further.

01:48:34.620 --> 01:48:36.940
We'd take it super, super, super, far.

01:48:36.940 --> 01:48:41.340
And we don't treat it as though
it's a butter in a recipe.

01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:43.656
Yeah.

01:48:43.656 --> 01:48:46.151
AUDIENCE: Do you guys use
exclusively combi ovens

01:48:46.151 --> 01:48:50.200
and what besides the [INAUDIBLE]?

01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:52.930
CHRISTINA TOSI: We do use
exclusively combi ovens.

01:48:57.460 --> 01:49:00.750
We use exclusively combi ovens
because all of our recipe testing,

01:49:00.750 --> 01:49:03.430
it's sort of one of those
funny accidents where

01:49:03.430 --> 01:49:06.690
those were the only ovens that
existed at the restaurants

01:49:06.690 --> 01:49:13.840
when I first started at Momofuku and
so all of the recipe testing that I did

01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:16.340
happened in those combi ovens.

01:49:16.340 --> 01:49:22.302
In the restaurants we use them to cook
proteins, we use them to steam eggs

01:49:22.302 --> 01:49:23.490
and so on and so forth.

01:49:23.490 --> 01:49:27.750
We use the combi ovens
largely on convection to bake.

01:49:27.750 --> 01:49:32.720
For the combination
function, we only use

01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:35.820
the combination function of steam
and convection to make bagel bombs,

01:49:35.820 --> 01:49:39.610
but we use the steam
function to steam buns.

01:49:39.610 --> 01:49:42.060
We make pork buns and veggie buns.

01:49:42.060 --> 01:49:48.160
Steamed buns are essentially like bread
dough that is steamed instead of baked.

01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:49.090
We steam eggs.

01:49:49.090 --> 01:49:50.900
But we don't steams eggs at 212.

01:49:50.900 --> 01:49:53.940
We'll steam them lower at 145.

01:49:53.940 --> 01:49:55.880
And that's the cool
part of a combi oven.

01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:58.500
It allows you-- it
creates a false-- I mean,

01:49:58.500 --> 01:50:02.980
can you create steam at a
temperature lower than 212?

01:50:02.980 --> 01:50:06.966
In theory, I mean,
sorry, in real terms, no.

01:50:06.966 --> 01:50:12.340
But essentially the oven keeps at a
temperature that's lower than 212,

01:50:12.340 --> 01:50:15.690
and it injects steam in
or water in and knows

01:50:15.690 --> 01:50:21.500
how much it can inject with that
spiking above the set temperature.

01:50:21.500 --> 01:50:25.950
But we use it for many different
things but on the combination function

01:50:25.950 --> 01:50:30.165
of steam and convection the bagel
bombs are the only thing that we use

01:50:30.165 --> 01:50:31.540
or that we back in that capacity.

01:50:31.540 --> 01:50:34.580
MICHAEL BRENNER: So may I just
You know what I'm going to do?

01:50:34.580 --> 01:50:39.600
Can we ask Christina and
Jenna to finish the cake

01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:42.080
because I know I think you
guys could, and this is great,

01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:43.920
ask questions all night.

01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:47.380
But the only thing that worries me is,
there's a book signing outside where--

01:50:47.380 --> 01:50:48.755
CHRISTINA TOSI: Oh, am I signing?

01:50:48.755 --> 01:50:50.900
I'm signing books.

01:50:50.900 --> 01:50:53.460
And I mean, Christina looks
like she has infinite energy,

01:50:53.460 --> 01:50:57.310
but I'm afraid at some point, she may
run out of energy to sign the books,

01:50:57.310 --> 01:50:59.250
which might be bad.

01:50:59.250 --> 01:51:02.870
So why don't we let them
finish up this cake.

01:51:02.870 --> 01:51:05.560
And then we'll take one
or two more questions.

01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:07.140
And then Christina can sign books.

01:51:07.140 --> 01:51:07.700
CHRISTINA TOSI: You're going to clap?

01:51:07.700 --> 01:51:09.020
MICHAEL BRENNER: But
not until you're done.

01:51:09.020 --> 01:51:09.250
CHRISTINA TOSI: OK.

01:51:09.250 --> 01:51:10.075
We always clap.

01:51:10.075 --> 01:51:11.450
I mean of course, we should clap.

01:51:11.450 --> 01:51:12.392
We should clap twice.

01:51:12.392 --> 01:51:13.334
Let's clap.

01:51:13.334 --> 01:51:18.022
[APPLAUSE]

01:51:18.022 --> 01:51:19.730
CHRISTINA TOSI: The
funny thing is I know

01:51:19.730 --> 01:51:23.310
it seems like it's going to take
more than like three minutes to make

01:51:23.310 --> 01:51:24.977
this layer, to assemble this layer cake.

01:51:24.977 --> 01:51:26.601
But Jenna and I are true professionals.

01:51:26.601 --> 01:51:28.740
So you're going to watch
her zoom through it.

01:51:28.740 --> 01:51:31.710
As I talk you through what's happening.

01:51:31.710 --> 01:51:35.031
So best part about layer cakes.

01:51:35.031 --> 01:51:35.530
What?

01:51:35.530 --> 01:51:36.238
What's happening?

01:51:36.238 --> 01:51:37.355
Go, go, go, go, go.

01:51:37.355 --> 01:51:38.480
JENNA: Did you use a timer?

01:51:38.480 --> 01:51:40.271
CHRISTINA TOSI: The
best part layer cake is

01:51:40.271 --> 01:51:44.300
that everyone thinks you have
to be like fancy and worried

01:51:44.300 --> 01:51:45.490
about all these things.

01:51:45.490 --> 01:51:46.370
You don't.

01:51:46.370 --> 01:51:49.850
We baked our cake evenly
in that baking tray.

01:51:49.850 --> 01:51:52.950
We cut out two rounds
that look pretty good.

01:51:52.950 --> 01:51:55.840
Truth be told, you need one
really good looking top of it.

01:51:55.840 --> 01:51:57.584
We need one really good round.

01:51:57.584 --> 01:51:59.250
That's going to be the top of your cake,

01:51:59.250 --> 01:52:04.174
When you're looking at this cake, you
can't see what's happening down below.

01:52:04.174 --> 01:52:06.840
You can only see what's happening
up top here on this top layer.

01:52:06.840 --> 01:52:09.980
So the prettiest round's for top.

01:52:09.980 --> 01:52:13.700
The second prettiest round
is the center of the cake.

01:52:13.700 --> 01:52:17.451
What people won't tell you is
that the bottom round-- No, I know

01:52:17.451 --> 01:52:18.950
I think you're laughing, guess what?

01:52:18.950 --> 01:52:20.710
This is what we do every single day.

01:52:20.710 --> 01:52:23.700
People think that you need
this beautiful round of cake

01:52:23.700 --> 01:52:25.530
to make a layer cake.

01:52:25.530 --> 01:52:26.260
You don't.

01:52:26.260 --> 01:52:28.810
We take some of the
cake scraps but enough

01:52:28.810 --> 01:52:32.010
to leave some left
over for take truffles

01:52:32.010 --> 01:52:36.460
and we piece together a
bottom layer of the cake.

01:52:36.460 --> 01:52:39.900
Cake is a bummer when it's
dry and crumbly, right?

01:52:39.900 --> 01:52:43.310
So in pastry school they
teach you to soak a cake.

01:52:43.310 --> 01:52:48.000
Typically they teach you soak a cake
with simple syrup or liquor, a liqueur.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:48.500
OK.

01:52:48.500 --> 01:52:50.140
I can get on board with that.

01:52:50.140 --> 01:52:53.597
But I just like simple syrup
doesn't taste like anything.

01:52:53.597 --> 01:52:55.430
It's sugar water and
we're not hummingbirds.

01:52:57.960 --> 01:52:59.070
You know it's true.

01:52:59.070 --> 01:53:02.750
And it's a missed opportunity, like
many things in the pastry world,

01:53:02.750 --> 01:53:06.350
in the culinary world, it's a
missed opportunity to add flavor.

01:53:06.350 --> 01:53:08.970
And the story of our cake is
all about chocolate and passion

01:53:08.970 --> 01:53:09.820
freedom and coffee.

01:53:09.820 --> 01:53:12.140
So we soak the cake with
a passion fruit puree.

01:53:12.140 --> 01:53:15.550
Anything that's flavor and has
liquid, can be a cake soak.

01:53:15.550 --> 01:53:18.600
Anything that's flavor
in a liquid form can also

01:53:18.600 --> 01:53:22.080
be the binder for a cake
truffle, so for cake scraps.

01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:23.970
Passion fruit down.

01:53:23.970 --> 01:53:28.290
Then we put three layers in the cake
before we put the next physical cake

01:53:28.290 --> 01:53:29.150
layer on top.

01:53:29.150 --> 01:53:31.880
We have two spreadable fillings
and one textural filling.

01:53:31.880 --> 01:53:35.920
This is the formula every
Milk Bar cake and is made of.

01:53:35.920 --> 01:53:37.640
So cake, soak.

01:53:37.640 --> 01:53:38.770
One spreadable filling.

01:53:38.770 --> 01:53:42.190
The first spreadable filling is usually
the filling that's harder to spread.

01:53:42.190 --> 01:53:44.740
In this case, it's passion fruit curd.

01:53:44.740 --> 01:53:50.230
We made it before you
guys came, just because we

01:53:50.230 --> 01:53:51.930
didn't want to show off too much.

01:53:51.930 --> 01:53:54.350
So passion fruit curd goes down.

01:53:54.350 --> 01:53:56.100
Passion fruit curd is
passion fruit juice.

01:53:56.100 --> 01:54:01.240
It's eggs that are cooked with passion
fruit juice, some sugar, and some salt.

01:54:01.240 --> 01:54:05.510
Off the heat, once the
eggs thicken, we add

01:54:05.510 --> 01:54:07.590
butter, and a little bit of gelatin.

01:54:07.590 --> 01:54:14.404
The gelatin helps keep
the curd in a nice state.

01:54:14.404 --> 01:54:15.820
MICHAEL BRENNER: It emulsifies it.

01:54:15.820 --> 01:54:16.695
JENNA: What was that?

01:54:16.695 --> 01:54:18.470
Emulsified state.

01:54:18.470 --> 01:54:24.530
So that it naturally won't
want to separate out too much.

01:54:24.530 --> 01:54:29.510
But we need it to be happily
emulsified as a layer cake

01:54:29.510 --> 01:54:32.720
because it's going to change
temperatures a few times when

01:54:32.720 --> 01:54:36.410
we make it and freeze it and defrost
it and serve it at room temperature.

01:54:36.410 --> 01:54:42.340
And that helps that emulsification
withhold the process.

01:54:42.340 --> 01:54:45.920
The textural layer that we're putting
in the cake is chocolate crumb.

01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:48.930
So crunch, a crumb, anything that
has texture and flavor and helps

01:54:48.930 --> 01:54:52.470
tell the story can be a layer of cake.

01:54:52.470 --> 01:54:55.050
It's also a really fun
surprise because you can only

01:54:55.050 --> 01:54:59.160
like kind of sort of tell that
there's anything else in there when

01:54:59.160 --> 01:55:02.640
you look at the cake, so
chocolate crumbs go down.

01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:05.910
The next layer is our
second spreadable filling.

01:55:05.910 --> 01:55:08.550
And in this case, it's coffee frosting.

01:55:08.550 --> 01:55:15.460
And so cake, soak, spreadable layer one,
textural layer, spreadable layer two,

01:55:15.460 --> 01:55:17.070
and then we build it up again.

01:55:17.070 --> 01:55:20.340
Remember we're saving our most
beautiful layer for the top,

01:55:20.340 --> 01:55:25.250
and our second most beautiful
layer for the middle.

01:55:25.250 --> 01:55:26.680
All the way up.

01:55:26.680 --> 01:55:28.350
Chocolate chips to garnish.

01:55:28.350 --> 01:55:32.860
What we do is we take the
cake and we freeze it.

01:55:32.860 --> 01:55:35.990
We freeze it so that all
of the fillings firm up.

01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:41.160
We also freeze it because we're
building this cake in a cake ring

01:55:41.160 --> 01:55:42.760
that has some acetate in it.

01:55:42.760 --> 01:55:45.860
The acetate helps provide a
structure and collar to the cake

01:55:45.860 --> 01:55:50.560
because they don't make many
cake rings as tall as this cake.

01:55:50.560 --> 01:55:55.260
Most pastry chefs use
acetate for chocolate works.

01:55:55.260 --> 01:55:57.257
You typically use tempered chocolate.

01:55:57.257 --> 01:55:59.340
You make something pretty
and delicious out of it.

01:55:59.340 --> 01:56:03.740
You leave it on a piece
of this acetate to set.

01:56:03.740 --> 01:56:08.250
And then when you peel it off
you get this beautiful shiny film

01:56:08.250 --> 01:56:08.980
on the bottom.

01:56:08.980 --> 01:56:13.000
So we apply the same theory
here and for our cake.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:17.120
So that when we go to take
our cake out of the freezer,

01:56:17.120 --> 01:56:22.360
and we peel the acetate back, we get
this really beautiful finished edges.

01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:24.990
Because of what we
already discussed earlier,

01:56:24.990 --> 01:56:28.470
we're not going to spend our time
making that cake look picture perfect.

01:56:28.470 --> 01:56:32.600
And so this really helps the process.

01:56:32.600 --> 01:56:35.180
All the way back up, oh, sorry.

01:56:35.180 --> 01:56:40.580
All the way back up again, layer
by layer by layer by layer.

01:56:40.580 --> 01:56:42.730
I'm going to let Jenna finish.

01:56:42.730 --> 01:56:46.480
You guys look so intrigued by
what's going on on the screen.

01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:47.230
It's like a movie.

01:56:51.780 --> 01:56:56.760
I think a lot of people think cakes have
to be perfect, and just so and as you

01:56:56.760 --> 01:57:01.590
guys saw Jenna, we
use the back of spoons

01:57:01.590 --> 01:57:05.700
that we bend at an angle as well
as our little offset spatula.

01:57:05.700 --> 01:57:10.000
And it's how about getting the flavor
and the feelings in there in order,

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:14.500
so that when you go to take a bite of
the cake, that's what you're tasting.

01:57:14.500 --> 01:57:15.980
But it never happens perfectly.

01:57:15.980 --> 01:57:20.600
That's not what happens
in real cake world,

01:57:20.600 --> 01:57:23.290
but all of the feelings that
do get layered into a cake

01:57:23.290 --> 01:57:29.140
get layered and just so, so that they're
all emulsified in and of themselves,

01:57:29.140 --> 01:57:33.289
but they're also and the correct
density or the correct weight,

01:57:33.289 --> 01:57:35.330
so that you don't have
one filling that's heavier

01:57:35.330 --> 01:57:37.050
than another, that then bows out.

01:57:37.050 --> 01:57:40.350
Or when you go to cut the
cake, not like you smush down

01:57:40.350 --> 01:57:45.337
on a burger and all of the
condiments come out of the side.

01:57:45.337 --> 01:57:46.170
I think that's good.

01:57:46.170 --> 01:57:48.330
JENNA: Oh that was really good.

01:57:48.330 --> 01:57:53.420
CHRISTINA TOSI: So cake, soak,
passion fruit curd, chocolate crumbs,

01:57:53.420 --> 01:57:55.670
coffee frosting, and she'll
layer it up one more time.

01:57:59.042 --> 01:57:59.542
[APPLAUSE]

01:57:59.542 --> 01:58:01.478
I think she gets a round of applause.

01:58:06.430 --> 01:58:10.680
MICHAEL BRENNER: I can't help but
observe that everything in this cake

01:58:10.680 --> 01:58:14.800
is an emulsion with a
volume fraction above 64%

01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:17.774
except for one thing,
which is this puree.

01:58:17.774 --> 01:58:19.440
CHRISTINA TOSI: The passion fruit puree?

01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:22.020
The passion fruit puree,
which is a liquid.

01:58:22.020 --> 01:58:24.670
But there's stuff in
the liquid and that's

01:58:24.670 --> 01:58:28.040
because the volume
fraction is less than 63%.

01:58:28.040 --> 01:58:28.830
But it's viscous.

01:58:28.830 --> 01:58:30.674
It's more viscous than water.

01:58:30.674 --> 01:58:31.590
CHRISTINA TOSI: It is.

01:58:31.590 --> 01:58:32.720
MICHAEL BRENNER: It's
more viscous than water.

01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:34.140
And that's last week.

01:58:34.140 --> 01:58:37.760
That's what you all missed with
the question for last week.

01:58:37.760 --> 01:58:38.490
OK.

01:58:38.490 --> 01:58:39.900
so let's do one more question.

01:58:39.900 --> 01:58:41.190
I think, maybe two more.

01:58:41.190 --> 01:58:41.882
Don't you think?

01:58:41.882 --> 01:58:42.700
CHRISTINA TOSI: Yeah, sure.

01:58:42.700 --> 01:58:45.030
You can ask me questions-- if you
don't get a chance to ask me questions,

01:58:45.030 --> 01:58:47.230
you can ask me questions when
your book signed out there.

01:58:47.230 --> 01:58:47.450
How's that?

01:58:47.450 --> 01:58:47.949
OK.

01:58:47.949 --> 01:58:48.859
What have we got?

01:58:48.859 --> 01:58:49.775
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:58:52.192 --> 01:58:55.400
MICHAEL BRENNER: Turn on your microphone
because otherwise we can't hear you.

01:59:00.060 --> 01:59:04.260
AUDIENCE: --of beating roughly
how small are the air bubbles--

01:59:04.260 --> 01:59:07.760
MICHAEL BRENNER: Ooh,
such a good question.

01:59:07.760 --> 01:59:10.910
AUDIENCE: And how large
do they get during baking?

01:59:10.910 --> 01:59:12.190
MICHAEL BRENNER: Yeah.

01:59:12.190 --> 01:59:13.040
CHRISTINA TOSI: You
want to take this one?

01:59:13.040 --> 01:59:14.581
MICHAEL BRENNER: Can I take that one?

01:59:14.581 --> 01:59:17.240
We thought about bringing a
microscope here to put on the side

01:59:17.240 --> 01:59:19.130
so that we could answer that question.

01:59:19.130 --> 01:59:22.184
I mean the one problem is that this
batter is so thick that I think

01:59:22.184 --> 01:59:25.100
we wouldn't have been able to get a
thin enough layer to actually make

01:59:25.100 --> 01:59:26.590
the measurement on the slide.

01:59:26.590 --> 01:59:29.770
On the other hand, it is true, you
know, the mayonnaise making contest

01:59:29.770 --> 01:59:31.520
that I told you at the
beginning I thought

01:59:31.520 --> 01:59:33.640
was silly when I was
presenting it, I thought

01:59:33.640 --> 01:59:35.860
why am I talking about a
mayonnaise making contest.

01:59:35.860 --> 01:59:38.276
I had no idea you were going
to beat for 10 minutes, which

01:59:38.276 --> 01:59:39.990
is exactly how you get the same volume.

01:59:39.990 --> 01:59:41.320
It's the same thing.

01:59:41.320 --> 01:59:45.580
So those air bubbles are getting,
I'll be you they're 10 microns.

01:59:45.580 --> 01:59:47.880
And then when you bake,
right, then there's

01:59:47.880 --> 01:59:51.420
carbon dioxide gas that's released
that basically puffs them up.

01:59:51.420 --> 01:59:53.920
It would be a good experiment
if you were taking this class,

01:59:53.920 --> 01:59:58.110
we would tell you this was
a great project to work on.

01:59:58.110 --> 01:59:59.530
CHRISTINA TOSI: Assignments.

01:59:59.530 --> 02:00:00.030
Yes.

02:00:00.030 --> 02:00:00.840
MICHAEL BRENNER: No,
it's not an assignment.

02:00:00.840 --> 02:00:01.930
It's a project.

02:00:01.930 --> 02:00:02.310
CHRISTINA TOSI: Project.

02:00:02.310 --> 02:00:02.810
Project.

02:00:02.810 --> 02:00:04.066
Project.

02:00:04.066 --> 02:00:04.566
Yes.

02:00:09.809 --> 02:00:12.850
AUDIENCE: Can you talk a little bit
about how your design process differs

02:00:12.850 --> 02:00:16.280
for the desserts that you design for
the Mike Bar versus the plated desserts

02:00:16.280 --> 02:00:19.060
at the restaurants?

02:00:19.060 --> 02:00:22.180
CHRISTINA TOSI: Yes, I absolutely will.

02:00:22.180 --> 02:00:27.390
We typically become--
the design process is not

02:00:27.390 --> 02:00:29.420
that much different is the short answer.

02:00:29.420 --> 02:00:36.980
The long answer is that we
think, often times of desserts,

02:00:36.980 --> 02:00:40.290
whether there are the desserts for
one of the other Momofuku restaurants

02:00:40.290 --> 02:00:44.280
or they're a new item
for the Milk Bar menu

02:00:44.280 --> 02:00:48.870
as simply as a vehicle like to tell
a story, to tell a flavor story.

02:00:48.870 --> 02:00:54.020
So oftentimes we'll become
obsessed with a flavor or an idea.

02:00:54.020 --> 02:00:56.990
And it's really just about
finding a vehicle for it.

02:00:56.990 --> 02:01:00.990
So I'm not like sitting on
my hands and be like, oh, I

02:01:00.990 --> 02:01:04.830
can't wait to put the Ssam Bar
dessert on because I already

02:01:04.830 --> 02:01:06.620
know what it's going to be.

02:01:06.620 --> 02:01:10.420
It's more, OK, so it's time to
change Ssam Bar's dessert menu.

02:01:10.420 --> 02:01:14.340
What flavors are we thinking about?

02:01:14.340 --> 02:01:17.400
Where are we at in the R&amp;D
process with interesting things?

02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:24.870
If we like a flavor story or a flavor
profile, in something like a ganache,

02:01:24.870 --> 02:01:30.390
we almost always put it on the
menu at one of the restaurants

02:01:30.390 --> 02:01:34.200
because we can't really
live in ganache space

02:01:34.200 --> 02:01:37.130
with baked goods, just
the nature of them.

02:01:37.130 --> 02:01:38.850
They're expensive.

02:01:38.850 --> 02:01:43.207
They dry out very easily.

02:01:43.207 --> 02:01:45.290
So that's sort of a little
bit of a boring answer.

02:01:45.290 --> 02:01:48.510
But a lot of the nature of
running a bakery and baked goods

02:01:48.510 --> 02:01:52.290
is everything has to be fresh and
has to be able to sort of maintain

02:01:52.290 --> 02:01:54.345
and withstand a certain shelf life.

02:01:54.345 --> 02:01:56.970
And so depending on what the
vehicle is, sometimes that'll help

02:01:56.970 --> 02:01:59.844
dictate where it's going to go.

02:01:59.844 --> 02:02:02.010
But a lot of times, you
just go to the drawing board

02:02:02.010 --> 02:02:03.660
and go like, OK, what
are we excited about?

02:02:03.660 --> 02:02:05.910
What flavors are we excited
about putting together?

02:02:05.910 --> 02:02:07.980
And then we go, OK, what
are the next opening,

02:02:07.980 --> 02:02:10.910
like what are the next spots
that are opening up on what menu?

02:02:10.910 --> 02:02:13.577
And is it going to become a
soft serve for Noodle Bar?

02:02:13.577 --> 02:02:15.410
Is it going to become
a cookie for Milk Bar?

02:02:15.410 --> 02:02:19.950
Is it going to become a more
multicomponent dessert at Ssam Bar?

02:02:19.950 --> 02:02:23.590
And if it's a study of a flavor that we
really want to go down like the rabbit

02:02:23.590 --> 02:02:28.782
hole up of and that we love multiple
components m it almost always goes

02:02:28.782 --> 02:02:31.990
on one of the restaurant;s dessert menus
because that's a space where you can

02:02:31.990 --> 02:02:35.990
have more elements and you can put them
together and you can be a little more

02:02:35.990 --> 02:02:40.550
self0indulgent in the process because
everything happens all in minute when

02:02:40.550 --> 02:02:43.410
your plating a restaurant dessert.

02:02:43.410 --> 02:02:45.860
But the fun part about
creating stuff for Milk Bar

02:02:45.860 --> 02:02:49.674
is that you make it in such
big batches and so many more

02:02:49.674 --> 02:02:52.590
people get to experience it and take
it home and share it with others.

02:02:55.160 --> 02:02:56.880
So it really depends.

02:02:56.880 --> 02:03:01.629
But those are some of the parameters
that would help us make our decision.

02:03:01.629 --> 02:03:03.420
MICHAEL BRENNER: So I
think with that-- I'm

02:03:03.420 --> 02:03:04.961
sorry I'm going to just cut this off.

02:03:04.961 --> 02:03:06.100
I think we should clap.

02:03:06.100 --> 02:03:07.650
[APPLAUSE]
