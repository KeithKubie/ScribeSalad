KYLE KEANE: All right.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.060
So here is my public disclaimer
that will go on the video,

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.450
so that no one will
judge you for having only

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.400
had one day to do this project.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.220
They will be amazed at
how much you got done.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.720
So we're going to present--

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.600
and no one's project
is completely finished.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.190
So don't stress.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.880
This is a thing that
you had one day to do.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:44.030
And you will have three days and
a weekend to do the next one.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.210
So this is just a practice
run because next Friday you'll

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.010
have a much bigger project.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.630
And we'll invite other people.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.970
So here is about supporting
and learning from each

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.500
other's process, and learning
about what things you had

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.270
success with and what
things you didn't.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.940
So if somebody was
able to implement

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.489
a lean, then afterward you go,
hey, how did you do that lean?

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.620
Can I have your scripts?

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.110
Or if somebody
had a cool gesture

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.290
or if somebody had a nice
video game animation where

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.300
something grew and
something did something

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.190
in response to the
growth, you can ask them

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.560
how they implemented that.
