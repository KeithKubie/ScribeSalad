00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.000
There are plenty of
other sort of threats.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Social media, whatever you choose to
make public, people can learn a lot

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.530
about you, including who your
friends are and things like that.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.844
Tracking of web browsing, what sites
you visit, actually it's usable.

00:00:15.844 --> 00:00:20.272
The sites I choose to visit obviously
know about I visiting those websites.

00:00:20.272 --> 00:00:23.276
But the third parties that
actually can record or

00:00:23.276 --> 00:00:27.159
track the fact that you visited
the New York Times for example,

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:29.952
or you visited Facebook,
or whatever it is.

00:00:29.952 --> 00:00:33.457
There are a lot of location aware
applications that know where you

00:00:33.457 --> 00:00:34.720
are all the time.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.540
Again, the example of someone seeing
that you're in a certain location sort

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.610
of randomly is very different than
being able to do it constantly.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.980
And sometimes we are the enablers for

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.560
this sort of tracking that could happen,
so we are the willing party.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.648
For example,
if you use loyalty cards for

00:00:54.648 --> 00:00:58.652
a little discount in your grocery store,
of course they're able to track you.

00:00:58.652 --> 00:01:03.065
They know that you visited them, they
know what kind of things you bought,

00:01:03.065 --> 00:01:06.499
because they're able to tie
your multiple register use of

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:09.256
this loyalty card that
we're talking about.
