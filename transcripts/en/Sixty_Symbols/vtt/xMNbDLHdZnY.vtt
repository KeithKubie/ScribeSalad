00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.240
They kind of send you out in the room, and
you're just stood in the corridor being like:

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.180
"Did I pass? Did I fail?"

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.400
"Oh my god, I failed. I failed spectacularly.
Of course I failed."

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.680
And it's like the worst five minutes of your life.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.900
Before they like call you back in, and then like

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.220
the senior professor sort of sat me down
and said "Congratulations Dr. Smethurst".

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.200
And I was like... I could cry all day
and in front of the senior professor!

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.400
So, at Oxford, where I did my PhD,

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.540
they have this really cool tradition that you

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.240
pop a champagne cork into the ceiling tile

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.660
when you come out of your viva...

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.600
[Cheering]

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.860
...and you sign your name next to
the dent that you leave.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.820
And you can really get to like "leave your mark"
on Oxford physics, which is so cool.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.520
I got it first time, and I think I was more
scared for that than I was for my viva.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.840
I was terrified of it ricocheting off
the ceiling and hitting me in the eye.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.000
Like, fully like, nightmares about having a black eye on the day of my viva.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.920
Crowd:  Whoo!  That was. . . [Excited chatter.]

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.780
It's also a binary dent,

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.400
which, as an astronomer, I was really quite happy about.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.560
I left a binary dent! [laughter]

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.580
So, both ends of the champagne cork
dented into the ceiling,

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.460
because the champagne cork came out
and then came horizontal.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.220
So it looks like a little binary star in the ceiling.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.040
[Brady] Oh, well done. Are they unusual?

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.000
[Dr. Smethurst] Yeah, I think so. [laughter]

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.460
So, I was born in Preston and raised in Chorley—
so this is Lancashire.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.280
I went to school in Bolton, and then I went to do physics with astronomy at Durham University.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.320
I was like six years old and wanted
a telescope for Christmas,

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.240
like I was always into space: space books on the shelf,

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.980
getting little telescopes, always
wanting to go out and see the sky.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.380
But, I hated physics.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.780
So, up to about GCSE, I couldn't stand physics.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.640
Forces and "light goes in straight lines"
just didn't hold any interest for me at all.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.060
And it took getting to GCSE and
starting to do astronomy, and

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.680
radioactivity and things like this that made me
realise that I absolutely loved it.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.820
It's the sheer scale of space
that I thought was awesome.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.800
You read in your space books about
Jupiter is so much bigger than Earth,

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.940
and this is how much more massive the Sun is,

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.560
and this is how far away the moon is.
And you think, as a kid, wow.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.660
You can't even imagine those distances, and yet

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.900
you can go outside and still see it
in the sky... Just blew my mind.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.420
[laughing] I got a little thing. It was like a...

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.420
Erm, I don't even know how big it was...

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.120
I think it's like a one-inch refractor
or something. It was tiny.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.000
But it was really cool. I could see the moon, basically.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.440
And Jupiter looked like a bigger, bright spot
than it did with your own eye.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.500
But it was still amazing to have.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.200
I actually wanted to be a pediatrician at one point.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.440
I also wanted to be a marine biologist,

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.680
because I loved dolphins, and
wanted to work with dolphins.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.560
And then my mum told me that "Don't be ridiculous,
if you were a marine biologist in the UK,

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.040
you'd just take river samples from the Thames
all day, and that would be all you'd do."

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.560
Not realising that I could move
outside of the UK to do that.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.540
And that also, as an astronomer, I am probably
now going to end up doing that as well.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.000
So at Durham, I did physics and astronomy

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.040
because I knew astronomy was something that I loved.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.160
I always wanted to do the astronomy modules.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.660
So I got to do things like measuring the
temperature of Sun spots.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.500
At Durham in my second year, we took solar telescopes
out on the grass in the science site,

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.140
and people looked at us like we were crazy,
but I thought it was great.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.820
I got to use the telescopes on top of the roof, as well.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:31.100
You know, shovelling six inches of snow with a broom
off the telescopes in my third year,

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.820
on every clear night you could get, which meant
sacrificing a lot of nights out as a student.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.520
But, it was worth it in the end.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.000
End of four years, you're thinking,
"What on Earth do I do now?"

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.840
Everything up until that point has been so
sort of prescribed, a little bit:

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.320
You go to school, you do your A-levels,
you go to university.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.040
And then, you're just left to your own devices.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.200
And everyone's going off and applying for grad schemes.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.880
So you think, "OK, I'll apply for a grad scheme, sure."

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.300
And I ended up, in that September,
working at Rolls-Royce

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.520
on their engineering grad scheme, because

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.700
I never thought, or really sat down
about "what do I want to do?"

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.280
And then it took me until about November to
December to realise that

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.980
I missed astronomy so much!

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.200
Like, it didn't matter that I was kind of
doing the same thing every day:

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.700
sat at a desk and going through data and, you know,
just talking to people about science.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.400
[Because] it wasn't astronomy, it wasn't the same thing.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.060
And I missed it so much that I started applying for
PhD positions in that January.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.200
I applied five different places.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.700
So Manchester, Bristol, Durham again, Oxford...
Four different places.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.080
I had interviews at all of those places.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.800
Not just to interview to say "they want to work with you",

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.640
but also "do you want to work with them?"

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.520
Your supervisor is going to be
supervising for three years,

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.300
you got to like that person.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.500
And... I was then just waiting

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.800
to see who wanted me, where I wanted to go.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.700
I got the call from Oxford that
I'd been accepted on a PhD,

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.440
whilst I was in Bella Italia in Manchester
with my mum. [laughter]

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.000
It was a very excited phone call.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.600
I was so happy. The project there was perfect.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.000
It was working with Galaxy Zoo,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.420
which is this online citizen science platform

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.800
that gets the public to classify galaxies,

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.000
which I thought was amazing that I could

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.460
do research off the back of public's efforts.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.040
So my thesis was trying to figure out

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.000
why galaxies stopped forming stars.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.480
So you see a lot of blue, spiral, beautiful galaxies,

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.000
and then you see a lot of red, boring,
blobbish-kind-of-shape galaxies.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.460
We call them elliptical galaxies.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.000
So that area— If something's blue, it's very hot.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
It's star forming, it's got lots of young stars.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
If it's red, it's kind of dead and dying,
and there's not much going on.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.540
But the thing is, you end up seeing lots of

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.400
red spirals and blue ellipticals.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.240
So it's kind of all tangled together:

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.520
the shape that things are, and whether
things are forming stars or not.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.900
So the idea was to use the public's
classifications for Galaxy Zoo,

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.480
and then all our observations of galaxies
to look at this statistically

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.960
across a huge population, like as many galaxies
as you can get your hands on,

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.960
and see what was going on

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.700
using big population statistics.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.180
Things are more complicated than they seem.

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:13.860
That is definitely what I learned.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.760
Before, people thought there was this kind of

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.860
two specific tracks, that the spiral galaxies go one way

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.860
and the elliptical galaxies go the other way.

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.480
When you look at the whole population
and use statistics,

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.820
you see that actually there's kind of this
spread of different rates

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.580
that galaxies can start forming stars.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.780
And you also find that black holes
in the centre of the galaxies

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.480
play a huge role as well, and they could be

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.060
shutting down star formation really rapidly.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.540
Also, whether there's a lot of galaxies around a galaxy,

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.420
or whether the galaxy is isolated can also
have a massive impact as well.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:50.400
And you see that in the statistical results,
which is really cool.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.480
So yeah, this whole heft of a thesis.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.420
In fact this is double-sided.
You have to print it out, when you give it in,

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.980
single-sided, so it's even higher than that
when you give it in.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.440
And it feels like such a weight and
a meat of work that you've done.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.300
[Brady] What do you think an astronomer
who reads that would think

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.480
"Okay, that's new information to me."

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.640
[Dr. Smethurst] Yeah, well I mean
that's the definition of a thesis

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.360
is that you have to add something
to the scientific collective knowledge.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.880
There's also things I've added [like]

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.100
galaxies do stop forming stars at different rates.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.680
That's not two clear channels.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.460
That's something new that people will come to.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.660
I mentioned that black holes
can have a really big impact.

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.800
The supermassive ones at the centre of galaxies.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.920
[Brady] Besides learning a lot about star formation,

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.500
what did you learn about astronomy

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.300
over the three years of your PhD?

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.500
[Dr. Smethurst] That
there isn't an answer,

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.920
and that's where the fun bit is.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.760
I got into physics and astronomy and maths because

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.760
I liked it over English, because there was an answer.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.660
But the whole part about research is
there isn't an answer and...

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:53.080
Astronomy is... beautifully complicated,

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:57.520
and this huge, big picture that is

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.920
impossible to visualise for one person.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.700
And that collaboration between people is...

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:08.300
crucial in order to be able to figure it out.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:09.320
Yeah, I mean

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.640
the whole "What have the
astronomers ever done for us"

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:16.040
is such a repeated phrase in society and...

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.760
It's not necessarily a direct thing that we're doing—

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.100
we're not directly curing cancer—

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.940
but the imaging techniques that are being developed

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:26.540
that we're pushing forward, like we need to see deeper

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.180
and further and more than we've ever seen before,

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.800
are then applied to things like MRI machines

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.260
and CT scans, that are then used in medicine.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.740
Astronomers needed a better way to transfer data,

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.180
so they invented Bluetooth.

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:42.640
Now every single person has that in their
pocket, basically on their phone.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.560
So it's the kind of indirect things
that come from astronomy

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:49.620
that are useful in society,
but then also like

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.480
humans are naturally curious.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.240
Everybody wants to know
where we came from

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:57.840
and how the universe is
and what it's made of.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.700
Those answers are going to come
ultimately from astronomy.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.960
[Brady] Do you think most people
in the street are

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.580
curious for those answers,
at the level you're looking at?

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.720
[Dr. Smethurst] I'd hope that
if you say to them,

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.100
"Hey, there's a black hole at the centre of every galaxy,"

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.100
they'll be like, "Really? Cool."

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.500
I hope if you say to them
"The universe started this way,"

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:21.460
they'd at least be curious enough
to then ask follow-up questions,

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.340
even if they didn't understand it,
they can still be like

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.640
"But wait, what about this?"

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:31.600
I hope there was some vestige of curiosity
at the back of everybody's minds.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.100
I got this job, and basically they told me

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.900
write up your PhD as quick as you possibly can.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.080
So I wrote it up in two months,

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.900
with a 10-day holiday squished in the middle
as well, which was quite fun

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:49.080
and ended at Christmas which was nice.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.180
And then in January, 2nd of Jan, packed up,

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.720
moved, started my new job on the 3rd.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.000
So the whole point of this job was that

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.960
I wrote a proposal to say I want to research this,

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.740
and then they picked it because
they thought that sounded cool.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:05.100
So the research proposal is on this idea of

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.600
how do black holes affect their galaxies.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.580
Do they stop them from forming stars?

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.960
Does the energy output from the black hole

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.920
sort of move through the galaxy and
you get this sort of like

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.640
wave of star formation stopping?

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.360
Or does it put energy out into the surrounding area

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:27.500
which then cuts off gas supplies so there's
no more star formation?

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.440
That's what I'm going to be focusing on.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.800
I'm going to be using this really cool
new instrument as well.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.680
It doesn't just take one picture of a galaxy,

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.740
it takes 127 little ones.

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:41.260
So you can like sort of jigsaw-puzzle the galaxy up

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
so that you can see what is going on
in various different areas.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.200
Oh, there's loads of people working on this,

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.260
coming at it from different angles, like...

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.740
There's people coming at it from the
simulation angle, the theory angle.

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:55.320
There's people coming at it from
different wavelengths as well.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.020
I'm looking in the optical and the UV, and

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:02.080
there's people coming at it from the radio,
the X-ray, and even infrared as well.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.220
So we're all working on the same thing.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.920
It's just— to prove something, to prove a theory,

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.960
you need all those little bits of observational facts

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:13.500
in order for it to build up and say
"Right, we're definitely sure of this now."

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.060
The other part of this fellowship is that

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:18.060
I'm going to be working with Sixty Symbols.

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:21.360
And I'm going to be making videos about

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.700
my research and what I'm getting up to,

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:28.540
and cool things in astronomy and what I think
you guys want to know about.

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:30.680
I've always been into outreach.

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.220
Any age, basically: kids, adults.

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.740
I think it's fantastic for any person,

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:38.740
if you could just help them understand something.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:42.140
That light-bulb moment when they're
finally like "Oh, I get it now!"

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:45.580
is so gratifying as a scientist,

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:50.000
that you've made someone understand
the world that they live in.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.400
[Prof. Merrifield] That's true, but there's
a subtlety here, which is that actually

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.980
what you're doing isn't the two-body problem.

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:57.840
So the two-body problem is if you have
the Sun and something in orbit around it.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.020
What you're actually doing is a three-body
problem: you've got the Sun,

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.400
you've got the Earth, and you've got your satellite.
