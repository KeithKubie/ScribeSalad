00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.470
&gt;&gt; Travis Hensley: Good
afternoon everyone.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:25.860
My name is Travis Hensley.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.730
I'm a program specialist here
at the John W. Kluge Center.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.650
Just a few quick announcements.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.420
First of all, I'd
like to ask you all

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.380
to please put your
phone on silent.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.530
And I also want to let you
know that this is being filmed

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.390
for broadcast on
CSPAN History TV

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.930
and the Library of
Congress' website.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.490
It is my pleasure to introduce
acting deputy librarian

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.510
of Congress, Mark Sweeney.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:02.180
[ Applause ]

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.780
&gt;&gt; Mark Sweeney: Thank
you, and good afternoon,

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.050
and welcome to the
Library of Congress.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.350
It's my pleasure to welcome you

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.890
to the Library's historic
Thomas Jefferson Building

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.720
and this afternoon symposium
1619 in the Making of America,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.510
which is being hosted by the
John W. Kluge Center here

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.540
at the Library of Congress.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.630
The Kluge Center was
founded in 2000 in order

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.790
to foster the mutually enriching
relationship between scholars

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.020
and political leaders.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.270
The Kluge Center
attracts to Washington,

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.460
the best minds available
in the scholarly world.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.770
Facilitates their access to
the Library's rich, diverse

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.690
and enduring source
of knowledge.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.250
And engages them in conversation
with the US Congress

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.650
and other political figures.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.390
Today's symposium is being
held in collaboration

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.100
with the Middle Passage Project
of the College of William

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.200
and Mary, Norfolk
State University

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.660
and the Virginia Commonwealth's
2019 Commemoration.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.720
Founded in 1995, the Middle
Passage Project explores the

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.510
history and memory surrounding
the Transatlantic slave trade,

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:12.680
its resounding effects on
Africans in the Americas

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.600
and its representation
in literature,

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.860
the humanities, art and history.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.260
1619 was a pivotal year
in America's history

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.470
and marks the arrival
of the first Africans

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.470
to English North
America, the establishment

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.450
of the first permanent
English colony in North America

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.480
at Jamestown, Virginia, and the
first representative legislative

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.940
assembly in the new world
with the founding of the House

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.380
of House of Burgesses.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.320
This symposium will explore
the intricate encounters

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.860
of Africans, Europeans

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.670
and Native peoples during
this significant period.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.970
Who are the Africans that
arrived in Jamestown in 1619?

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.650
Where did they come from?

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.090
What world did they
bring with them?

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.290
What emerged from the
Africans' engagement

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.910
with indigenous Native American
populations and their spiritual

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.110
and cultural life ways?

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.320
And what is the enduring
legacy of this encounter today?

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.440
So many questions that we can
have answered, hopefully, today.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.970
Today's program will promote
historical accessibility

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.000
to the meaning of 1619
and lay the groundwork

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.710
for a national dialogue
and renewed understanding

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.830
of the major events that
began 400 years ago.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.950
Lastly, our curators here

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.060
at the Library have
prepared a special treat

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.680
for you this afternoon.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.010
They've assembled a display of
treasures and historical items

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.690
from the Library's collections
related to the early Americas,

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.530
and I invite you to explore them

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.550
in the other room there
after the program.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.010
And now let me turn this
over to today's convener,

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.260
the 2015 Larsen Fellow in
Health and Spirituality

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.380
at the John W. Kluge
Center and the director

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.450
of The Middle Passage
Project, Dr. Joanne Braxton.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.250
Thank you.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:15.060
[ Applause ]

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.110
&gt;&gt; Joanne M. Braxton: Thank you
for that warm welcome, Mark.

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:20.740
It's good to be here.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:25.020
On behalf of The
Middle Passage Project,

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.200
the Joseph Jenkins Roberts
Institute for Africana Studies

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.280
at Norfolk State University
International Programs,

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.290
the Virginia Historical
Foundation for the Humanities,

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:41.150
the College of William &amp;
Mary's 1619 project initiative,

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.050
our lemon project and
the Nottoway Indian Tribe

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.730
of Virginia and especially
the 2019 Commemoration

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.840
American Evolution.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.000
I thank you for making
us welcome here today

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.610
at the John W. Kluge Center.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.210
And we would also like to add
our welcome, our warm welcome

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.540
to everyone who has come
out today, not only to hear,

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.960
but to engage and participate

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.640
in what we hope will be a
transformative conversation.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:25.000
I would like to give a special
thank you to Travis Hensley

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.010
of the Library of
Congress Office

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.990
of Scholarly Programs
Kluge Center

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:36.160
for seeing the significance of
today's symposium and exhibition

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.870
and supporting it with
enthusiasm and gusto

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.510
over a period of time.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:51.040
[ Applause ]

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.970
We all love Travis.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:05.580
We hope that this conversation
will lay the groundwork

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:11.700
for a national dialogue and
reinterpretation of major events

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:16.990
that began in 1619 that
would shape the contours

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.470
and character of America today.

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:25.690
This event is part
of a larger project

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:30.790
of 2019 commemoration
American Evolution

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:36.110
that will bring programs, events
and scholarly conversations

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.230
to the Commonwealth of
Virginia and the nation

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:45.150
in the next two years
as we examine 400 years

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.230
of American history in Virginia.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:54.000
Our speakers today are
Professor Robert Trent Vinson

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.110
of the College of
William &amp; Mary,

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.240
Professor Cassandra
Newby-Alexander

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.530
of Norfolk State University,
Chief Lynette Allston

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:06.290
of the Nottoway Indian tribe
of Virginia, Incorporated

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:10.160
and myself, Joanne Braxton.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.340
You have our bios
in your program,

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:18.070
so I will spare you
reading the biographies.

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:23.050
Our presentations today will
range from the scholarly

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:28.530
and the historical to
informed personal reflections.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:32.750
And again, there will
be a time for engagement

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.390
as indicated on your program.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:43.430
So, without further ado, I would
welcome Robert Trent Vinson,

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:45.510
my esteemed colleague.

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:51.500
[ Applause ]

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:56.370
&gt;&gt; Robert Trent Vinson:
Thank you, Dr. Braxton.

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:57.670
Thank you to the Kluge Center.

00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:58.970
There are many, many
thanks to give.

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:00.600
I have limited time,

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.740
and academics are
notoriously long-winded.

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:06.320
So I could take up all my time
by giving thanks to everyone.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.120
So, thank you to everyone.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.670
So my job here is to talk a bit
about the African background

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:18.260
and the Transatlantic journeys
of the 1619, 20 and odd Negroes

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.200
that arrived at Point
Comfort, Virginia.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.560
Point Comfort, which
is now Hampton.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:28.360
Right near the fledgling
Jamestown settlement in 1619.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.660
Who were they?

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.970
Where did they come from?

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:33.340
And what was their experience?

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.610
What might their
experience have been as best

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:38.750
as we can reconstruct it?

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:43.450
In August 1619, a captive woman
named Angela, part of those 20

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:50.140
and odd Africans that
landed at Point Comfort,

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:59.190
arrived traumatized, mentally,
emotionally and physically,

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:04.920
that endured a long journey
of months from their homes

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.470
in West Central Africa.

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:10.570
They likely came from the
West Central African states

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:12.980
of Congo and Ndongo.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:16.370
If you take a look at
the map to the left here,

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:19.470
you'll see this region
of West Central Africa,

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:25.210
and you'll see Congo, and
you'll also see Ndongo

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:26.510
in this area here.

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:27.810
I hope everyone can see okay.

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:32.750
And you'll also notice
the word Luanda,

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:37.290
which will be the capital of a
Portuguese colony called Angola.

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:40.640
So those are our three major
points that I'll refer to.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:46.810
Of course, the 1619 Africans
were not the first time

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:48.940
that Africans had arrived
in the Western Hemisphere.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:54.090
By the time Angela and her
fellow captors had arrived,

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:59.120
about 500,000 enslaved
Africans had already gone

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:04.060
on a transatlantic journey
from the West Coast of Africa

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:08.070
into the Americas, primarily in
Spanish colonies in the Americas

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:11.080
and the Portuguese
colony of Brazil.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:16.960
They came from densely
settled urban towns.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.480
Some came from rural villages

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.920
where they would have
raised agricultural crops

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.200
like sorghum and millet.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:27.270
Some might have tended
livestock including cattle.

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:31.380
And interestingly enough, if
you notice their names, Angela,

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:37.170
Pedro, Peter, some featured
Iberian and Christian names.

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:39.430
And that is indicative of
the fact that in this area,

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:43.580
particularly in Congo, there had
been a longstanding engagement

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.960
with Christianity
and with Portugal.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.350
Congo, in particular, was
a strong political state

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:51.780
that maintained close
diplomatic, economic

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:53.790
and cultural ties with Portugal.

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:55.850
With Portuguese Catholic
missionaries and traders

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:59.290
in Congo and Congolese
royal ambassadors

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:02.300
and other emissaries
going to Portugal starting

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:06.530
in the 15th century continuing
through the 16th century.

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:09.660
By 1491, Congolese royalty
declared Christianity

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:10.960
to be a state religion.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.690
But this was controlled
by the Congolese.

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:15.990
So it's not an imposition
by the Portuguese,

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:20.110
but this was Congolese engaging
in Christianity and using

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:23.370
that to start Congolese-run
Christian schools.

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:25.830
They were literate people

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:27.730
who spoke the closely
related languages

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:29.500
of Kikongo and Kimbundu.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.120
Some also spoke Portuguese.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:36.080
And by 1595, the papacy
in Rome had declared Congo

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.680
to be its own Episcopal
district,

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:43.110
and its primary church
became a cathedral.

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:48.730
Christianity also impacted in
the state of Ndongo as well.

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:51.810
So, the names are indicative

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:55.360
of this engagement
with Christianity.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.980
Now, though Congo had
exported enslaved people

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.840
to the African sugar-producing
island of South Tome

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:04.250
and West Africa, island
off of West Africa

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:08.040
and to Portugal itself,
since the early 16th century,

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:12.160
Portuguese military expeditions
later in that same century

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.480
against Ndongo and also Congo

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.760
where the immediate
circumstances had generated

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:22.660
thousands of enslaved war
captives including those

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.040
that came in 1619.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:28.740
As I mentioned, Portugal had
established a small colony

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:33.020
Angola in 1575, making
it the first African area

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.940
under European occupation
during the early years

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:39.110
of the Atlantic slave trade.

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:42.470
And this trade, of course,
extends across the world,

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:47.080
the transatlantic trade
from 1502 until 1870.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:51.080
This period of time when about
15 million Africans would have

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.030
boarded ships, and about 12
million Africans would have

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:57.180
arrived in the Americas.

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:00.650
Why the disparity of 15
million leaving Africa

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:04.990
and 12 million arriving
in the Americas?

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:07.390
The middle passage, right.

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:10.410
So an estimated 20 to 25%

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:14.710
of those Africans boarding those
ships in Africa did not make it

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:20.190
to the other side, Angela and
her fellow captives that arrived

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:25.390
in Port Comfort with
those who survived.

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:29.810
Now the Portuguese
dynamic is important here

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:31.990
because Angola became
a launching point

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:36.670
for Portuguese governors to
initiate war, specifically

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:39.600
to generate war captives.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:42.970
Angolan-based Portuguese
merchants held the asiento,

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:47.580
a contract with the Spanish
crown to deliver thousands

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:52.820
of slaves, enslaved people I
should say, to Spanish colonies.

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:56.940
So this combination of
policy, Portuguese policy,

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:01.440
to engage in war and a
contract, a commercial contract,

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:07.840
created a dynamic where
warfare was deliberately used

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:11.700
to generate war captives
and enslaved people.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:15.610
And now 1619 Africans
were part of this dynamic.

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:18.240
The Portuguese governor in 1617,

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:24.380
Luis Mendes de Vasconcellos
Mendes was bent on conquests

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:28.120
as the only means to get
the numbers that he wanted,

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:31.490
an estimated 9,000
to 12,000 annually.

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:36.340
In his reign from 1617 to 1621

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:40.720
over 50,000 Africans were
exported from Luanda.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:45.240
Over 150 slave ships left
the Angolan port of Luanda,

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:48.640
including our 1619 Africans.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.550
Now in contrast to
popular perceptions

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:53.750
that African tribal wars were
the cause of slave trading,

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:57.850
it was these military
expeditions of the Portuguese

00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:04.580
with mercenary militaristic
Africans known as the Imbangala

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:08.380
that drove these chaotic
lawless conditions.

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:11.670
In this war context then,
slavery became ubiquitous.

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:13.910
Slave economies developed
as the buying and selling

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:17.900
of enslaved people entered
African regional commercial

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:22.780
networks and slaves, not silver
money, became the currency

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:26.780
for all financial transactions
and for political tribute paid

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:30.480
by lesser states to
more powerful states

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:33.970
to whom they claimed
allegiance to.

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:39.130
These enslaved Africans like
Angela, deeply traumatized

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:41.730
by the circumstances
of their enslavement,

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:43.850
their forced separation
from family and friends

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:46.830
and the stripping of
their societal identities.

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:52.170
Imagine, all of who you are,
connected to all the people

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:55.470
that you love, no
longer matters.

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:57.440
That you are reduced,
dehumanized,

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.080
to be a unit of labor.

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:04.830
Imagine then that at
the point of capture,

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:07.150
which could be hundreds
of miles in the interior,

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:08.520
you are already starting a type

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:13.720
of middle passage even before
you step foot on a ship.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:16.970
Because quite often, the point
of capture during this point

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:18.280
of the Atlantic slave
trade could be

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:19.840
in the interior of Africa.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:22.860
And you could be marched to the
coast over hundreds of miles

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:25.430
and be sold over and over again

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:27.330
with different owners before
you even get to a ship.

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:31.250
And then imagine Angela and
her fellow captives boarding

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:35.940
that ship and being in the
holds of these slave ships.

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:42.860
And perhaps being
raped, women, children

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:45.750
and sometimes men, raped.

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:50.890
Imagine being chained to the
holds where there is nowhere

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:53.150
to go to the bathroom.

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:56.120
Imagine for the first
time being on an ocean.

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:59.100
Many Africans had never seen the
ocean much less been on a ship.

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:02.420
And dealing with the seasickness
that comes with that and having

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:05.770
to wallow in your
excrement and your vomit.

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:08.470
And dealing with a disease
that runs rampant in the holds.

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:11.230
Dysentery was a major killer.

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:14.010
And in the age of wind and
sail, when you had to rely

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:17.560
on the winds and the currents
to make it across the ocean,

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:18.860
that journey could take months.

00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:20.720
And you could run out of food.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:25.100
And already in a weakened state,
if you are perceived to be one

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:27.180
of the diseased or one of
the ones who are too weak

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:30.290
to make it across, you'd
be thrown overboard

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:31.590
where the sharks
that had learned

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:36.610
to follow these ships
would eat you.

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:41.470
Imagine that experience for
Angela and her fellow captives

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:44.620
that might have dealt
with some of this.

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:50.070
We do know that Angela was one
of 350 enslaved people loaded

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:55.230
onto the San Juan Bautista,
a Portuguese slaving ship,

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:58.680
leaving Luanda, bound
for the Spanish colony

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:01.480
in Veracruz, Mexico.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:08.150
That was supplying the
numbers needed in that asiento.

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:10.380
In Veracruz, they would
have joined a growing slave

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:12.540
population that included
plantation workers

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:14.240
and personal servants.

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:21.060
But, they didn't make it
to Veracruz, as we know.

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:22.520
They made it to Point Comfort.

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.220
So what happened?

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:27.520
In route to Veracruz, the
San Juan Bautista stopped

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.950
in Jamaica, selling 24 children.

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:34.250
And there were many
children on these voyages.

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:36.590
And they were exchanged
for needed supplies.

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:40.910
Perhaps the San Juan Bautista
was running low on supplies.

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:43.750
Now just a few days
away from Mexico,

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:47.990
the San Juan Bautista
was boarded

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:51.520
by two English privateers,
The White Lion,

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:54.650
The White Lion was carrying
a Dutch license to wage war

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:59.620
on the pirate ships,
and The Treasurer.

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:02.940
And those two ships took cargo
off of the San Juan Bautista

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:06.270
and about 60 enslaved people
with them, including Angela

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:09.920
and our 20 and odd
Negroes, or Africans.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:16.200
In late August 1619,
the White Lion arrived

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.500
in the Virginia settlement

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:20.990
that was encroaching upon
Native American territories.

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:24.380
Trading their 20 and odd
Negroes for victuals.

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:28.650
This is the [inaudible]
record food.

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:32.460
Angela and approximately 28
other captive Africans arrived

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:36.330
on The Treasurer four days
later after The White Lion.

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:39.140
But The Treasurer had sailed
on to a second English colony

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:43.700
of Bermuda, where most were
sold, including Angela.

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.280
But in February 1620,
Angela and a handful

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:47.810
of other original captives

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:51.060
from the San Juan Bautista found
themselves once again boarding

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:55.070
The Treasurer where they
landed back in Virginia.

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:56.430
And she and her fellow captives

00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:59.490
from West Central Africa
were most, if not all,

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:06.990
of the 32 Africans recorded
in Virginia's May 1620 census.

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:17.680
As I conclude, passing
through Imbangala, Portuguese,

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:20.650
Dutch and English hands,
the experience of Angela

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:23.900
and her fellow captives
foreshadowed major themes

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.520
in Africa and the
Atlantic world.

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:29.510
The Portuguese colony of Angola
reflected an early example

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:32.750
of intensifying slave
rating and slavery in Africa

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:35.380
and deepening European
economic interests

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:38.730
that would lead indirectly
to European colonialism,

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:43.370
of virtually all of Africa,
nearly three centuries later.

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:48.270
Luanda, the port from
which Angela and the 20

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:52.440
and odd Africans came
would be the export site

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:55.300
for 1.3 million other captives

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:58.370
over the entire Atlantic
slave trade period.

00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:01.730
More than any other
African port.

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:04.230
Angela's story also
provides a glimpse

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:08.040
of the increased Atlantic world
presence of not just the Spanish

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.450
and the Portuguese, but
particularly of the Dutch

00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:12.390
and the English and
the soon to be French

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:15.930
who are moving beyond
just pirating Portuguese

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:20.300
and Spanish ships for their
riches gained from slavery,

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:22.090
but to establish
their own colonies

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:23.580
in the Western Hemisphere.

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:27.510
And Jamestown was part
of that early effort.

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:31.130
England would be the
largest slave trading nation

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:32.940
in the 18th century.

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:36.760
To these erstwhile pirates
and aspirant colonists,

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:39.130
Angela and other enslaved
people would be critical

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:44.550
in generating untold
wealth for new societies

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:48.790
that were race-based, that
developed racial caste systems,

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:52.330
echoes of which we
still live with today.

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:53.670
Despite common perceptions

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:55.820
that enslaved Africans
came almost exclusively

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:58.970
from West Africa, and many did,

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:01.960
Angela's story illuminates
the fact that most

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:06.680
of the 500,000 African women,
men and children that arrived

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:11.450
in the Americas by 1619 came
from West Central Africa.

00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:13.810
It was these West Central
Africans like Angela

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:15.110
that were the chartered
generations,

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:16.410
those first generations
of Africans

00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:17.710
and the largest force
migration in world history

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:19.010
that laid the foundation
for the African diaspora

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:20.310
and the Americas.

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:22.110
Thank you for listening.

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:35.500
[ Applause ]

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:42.770
&gt;&gt; Cassandra Newby-Alexander:
Good afternoon.

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:50.900
My colleague has beautifully
laid out the foundation.

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:54.800
And I'm going to talk about
the rest of the story.

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:59.610
I'm going to take
you, not from the West

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:04.110
or Central African coastlines,
but rather to Virginia,

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:08.900
to the first place
where America began.

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:13.100
That beginning in 1619
with the arrival of the 20

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:17.230
and odd Negroes aboard the
English ship White Lion,

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:21.150
people of African descent
became a permanent cultural

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:23.440
and political fixture
in America.

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:28.060
For the first century, the vast
majority of the Africans coming

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:32.850
to Virginia were from
Central and West Africa.

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:36.650
Subjected to a kind of
forced acculturation

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:39.190
that accompanied
their enslavement,

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:42.790
Africans adapted over time.

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:46.620
This, however, did not imply
that they divested themselves

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:48.580
of their African culture.

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:54.830
Instead, they infused America's
evolving customs with art,

00:23:54.830 --> 00:24:00.160
music, culinary practices,
trading systems, agricultural

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:03.860
and architectural
techniques and language,

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:09.220
creating a creole society
that became the foundation

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:12.400
of an emerging American culture.

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.840
And though initially
small in number,

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:21.160
these first-generation Africans
helped define even the concepts

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:25.730
of freedom and liberty
because of their ongoing demand

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:29.080
for inclusion and civil rights.

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:34.280
Through this effort, they helped
establish an international

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:36.630
definition of freedom.

00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:42.300
Indeed, as the past 400
years will attest, Africans

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:46.030
and their descendants
embarked on a quest

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:50.400
to restore their humanity
and to be recognized

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:53.760
as true American citizens.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:57.270
After Africans began arriving
in the Virginia colony,

00:24:57.270 --> 00:25:01.140
many of the English officials
became these first owners

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:02.810
of these people.

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:06.100
Their plantations, as
you can see on this map

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:12.040
that is a map created by Smith

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.140
in the early part
of the 17th century.

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:17.200
And I want you to pay attention
to this because this kind

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:23.740
of takes our vantage point,
our viewpoint, and changes it.

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.040
It shifts it.

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:26.490
Our viewpoint is like this.

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:29.670
But the map takes it
and moves it that way.

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:31.470
Because when you
see the Chesapeake,

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:34.160
the Chesapeake is
usually, in our maps,

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.410
depicted almost north and south.

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:39.450
But this one actually
moves it almost

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:42.590
to an east-west direction.

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:46.350
And that is because that
was the vantage point

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:48.290
of the first people.

00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:50.830
It shows their trade
and their connections.

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:54.860
And that's why the first
Africans, when they arrived,

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:59.310
the English when they arrived,
the settled on the same lands

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:02.910
and oriented themselves
in the same way as many

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:05.990
of the Native peoples
who established the towns

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:09.200
and cities in Virginia.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:13.830
So these plantations that the
English gravitated towards

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:18.510
and created for themselves
were located on one of the 18

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:22.930
to 19 prime sites, so
along the James River.

00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:28.200
Starting between
April of 1619 and 120,

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:32.940
the early Africans were
concentrated in these areas,

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:36.720
James City, Elizabeth City
and Suri [phonetic] Counties.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:41.130
In these early years,
the Africans who appeared

00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:45.260
in the records typically were
listed along with their owners

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:50.160
and often with only a first
name, belying their status

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:55.210
in the colony, even during these
critical foundational years.

00:26:55.210 --> 00:27:00.650
According to the Virginia
muster records of 1624, 1625,

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:04.740
21 Africans lived in
the colonized area

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:07.070
of Abraham Percy's plantation,

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:11.190
now known as Flowerdew
Plantation or Flowerdew Hundred.

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:15.450
Only four out of the 11 people
mentioned were mentioned

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:16.750
by name.

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:20.590
So the rest of the people
didn't even have an identity

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:22.630
as a human being.

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:26.830
Well, those four people
included Anthony, Williams,

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:29.710
John and another Anthony.

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:33.660
If you notice, they lacked
a last name, a surname,

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:36.750
a name that would
give them civil rights

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:40.400
because it would recognize
them as human beings.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:45.990
In the township of Jamestown,
there were three Africans

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:49.490
who were listed with
only one listed by name,

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:52.370
and that name was misspelled.

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:58.130
The woman's name was Angela, and
yet, they listed her as Angelo.

00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:02.120
Angela was the first
African woman documented.

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:05.140
She was forcibly brought
into the Virginia colony,

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:08.640
as you heard earlier, on
this ship, The Treasurer.

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:13.630
She was listed as the property
of Captain William Pierce.

00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:15.610
She was referred to as quote,

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:20.170
that Negro woman
who raised pigs.

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:24.680
Angela was probably working
with Pierce's wife, Joan,

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:28.730
to maintain a three
two four-acre garden.

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:33.060
Another Angolan brought into
the colony was named Edward.

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:35.200
Identified as living

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:38.350
on a plantation called
Necoland [phonetic].

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:41.580
The owner was Richard Kingsmill.

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:47.370
Four other Angolans lived on
the Bennett Plantation, Peter,

00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:50.990
Anthony, Francis and Margaret.

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:54.650
While two others lived
at Elizabeth City,

00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:58.680
which is now Hampton, with
Captain William Tucker.

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:02.160
And their names,
Anthony and Isabella.

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.980
And reportedly, Anthony
and Isabella

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:09.640
who were married has a child
in 1624 that they named

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:13.380
after Captain William
Tucker, who interestingly,

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:17.110
became the child's godfather,

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:20.560
thereby protecting
that child's status.

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:25.240
Francis Payne was enslaved by
William Eltonhead [phonetic],

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:29.540
but by 1655, he was
listed as a free man

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:32.080
with a wife and children.

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:36.440
And he actually owned
land on Cherrystone Creek,

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:39.190
located on the eastern shore.

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:41.780
Emmanuel Drigues
[phonetic] or Rodrigues,

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:47.830
was listed as the property of
Captain Francis Pott in 1645.

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:50.960
And while it is unclear
when he became free,

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.570
he was part of a
minority of Africans

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:58.080
who gained their freedom,
securing 145 acres of land

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:03.230
on the eastern shore on King's
Creek in North Hampton County.

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:06.400
Similarly, William
Harmon, who was transported

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.880
to the Virginia colony
and enslaved in 1662

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:12.960
to William Kendall in North
Hampton County, again,

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:18.070
on the eastern shore, was
freed six years later in 1668,

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:21.640
and he was listed in the
records along with is wife,

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:26.550
who interestingly, was listed
with both a first and last name,

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:28.070
Jane Gossell [phonetic].

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:33.210
And he was listed as raising
cattle on the eastern shore.

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:37.720
So while there were some whose
status changed from enslaved

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:42.870
to free, the vast majority of
these early Africans were locked

00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:45.630
in a system of perpetual
servitude

00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:49.900
within the American
colonies' first slaving zone.

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:53.590
Even so, Africans
successfully adapted their labor

00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:57.320
and [inaudible] and traditions
to this new environment

00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:58.690
with responsibilities

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:02.480
that included agricultural
production, cooking,

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:05.440
construction and
household management.

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:08.690
It was during these early
years that African food

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:11.720
and culinary practices
were incorporated

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.400
into the Virginia colony.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:18.110
For example, the Virginia house
was an adapted architectural

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:21.290
model that English
colonists began constructing,

00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:24.770
similar to the shotgun houses
you see commonly in the South.

00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:29.490
Unlike the English houses that
were designed to retain heat

00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:32.010
and limit airflow
throughout the house,

00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:34.220
the Virginia houses
were constructed

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:37.800
to do just the opposite
because of the warm temperatures

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:40.250
and the humid environment.

00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:44.080
In early Virginia, northern
Native American foods

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:47.870
such as corn, squash, pumpkin
and beans, were integrated

00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:49.770
into the English diet.

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:53.590
These foods intersected
with the culinary traditions

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:57.200
that the English introduced
into America that included pigs

00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:02.840
and cattle, chicken and sheep,
wheat, flour, onions, carrots

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:06.000
and a variety of
greens and beans.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.380
They also introduced sweet
potatoes and white potatoes

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:14.390
to the colonies through
this Atlantic trade.

00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:17.620
When the Africans were brought
into the American colonies,

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:20.840
many of their native plants
accompanied them aboard these

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:26.910
ships, including black-eyed
peas, okra, yams, peanuts,

00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:29.410
watermelons, sesame
seeds, cassava,

00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:32.890
kola nuts, and lima beans.

00:32:32.890 --> 00:32:35.790
And because Africans were
brought into the colonies

00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:38.630
and lived and worked in
the households of some

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:42.640
of the most prominent planters,
the same planters, by the way,

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:46.680
responsible for transporting
supplies into the colony

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:50.930
and establishing the cultural
tone, they were tasked

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:52.710
with these cooking duties.

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:56.600
Historian Donna Gabaccia
argued, and I quote,

00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:01.220
"It was African slaves'
central position as producers

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:04.810
and processors of
food that allowed them

00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:08.150
to leave their own
special mark."

00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:11.970
It was in the Central
and West African areas,

00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:14.680
or I should say it was the
Central and West Africans

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:16.890
who laid the foundations
for the cuisine

00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:20.120
that we know today
as southern cooking.

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:24.670
Which infused dishes with hot
pepper and spices, millet,

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:27.070
peanuts and sweet potatoes.

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:31.950
For example, as they
mixed fried okra with rice

00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:35.000
and black-eyed peas using
slow cooking techniques

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.320
to produce dishes like
gumbo and peanut soup,

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:42.990
their African culinary practices
altered the way the English

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:45.860
and Native Americans
consumed food.

00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:48.780
Culinary Historian
Jessica Harris observed

00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:53.010
that food traditions
provide a historical roadmap

00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:54.860
for American society.

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:59.030
Because the foods we eat
hold symbols and meaning

00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:04.260
that connects us with our ethnic
origins and shared creole past.

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:08.130
America's colonial cookbooks
reflected the creolization

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:12.540
of foods and food ways
while simultaneously erasing

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:16.080
or making invisible the
contributions of the people

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:19.710
who created those food ways
and customs to begin with.

00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:23.790
Scholar Alisha Cromwell noted
that the challenge, therefore,

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:31.320
is "studying the silences"
of how Africans contributed

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:34.880
to the evolution of
American culture.

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:39.130
Religious expression of
these 17th century Africans,

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:43.600
as Rebecca Goetz's 2012
groundbreaking work,

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:47.630
The Baptism of Early
Virginia noted, how Africans

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:50.670
in Virginia used
religion as the vehicle

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:52.820
by which they individually

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:56.470
and collectively
expressed their voice.

00:34:56.470 --> 00:35:01.600
During the colonial period,
many sought to retain elements

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:05.280
of their African customs and
manners to the frustration

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:08.710
of whites who regarded
their refusal to assimilate

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:13.230
as indicators of their
heathenism and inferiority.

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:17.480
Yet, these 17th century Africans
came armed with the knowledge

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:21.440
of ecclesiastical and
theological rules called

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:23.490
from their knowledge
of Catholicism

00:35:23.490 --> 00:35:26.000
because of their contact
with the Portuguese.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.830
For a short period,
Africans were even able

00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:33.320
to use baptism practices and
the legal protections that came

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:37.790
from godparents as pathways
to freedom and a way

00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:40.280
to build community networks.

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:44.680
Thus, the American colonial
period was replete with examples

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:49.250
of how Africans infused their
various cultural practices

00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:51.310
into the overall culture

00:35:51.310 --> 00:35:55.350
that was evolving during these
early years, impacting everyone,

00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:58.110
not just those within
their community,

00:35:58.110 --> 00:36:04.250
but the entire community of
Virginia and later of America.

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:10.420
Religion, music, food ways,
customs, oral traditions,

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:17.800
language and art became uniquely
American because of the African.

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:20.820
Patent jubah [phonetic] which
was the beating of the hands

00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:23.640
on the thighs and the stomping
of the heels of the feet

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:26.200
to produce percussion music.

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:30.590
Fiddle and banjo music became
the traditional entertainment

00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:34.470
forms among Africans
and African-Americans.

00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:38.420
And because these individuals
were the primary musicians,

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:44.150
especially in Virginia, they
impacted the way that everyone

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:48.470
in the colony and later
in the nation saw music,

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:51.960
heard music, felt music.

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:57.480
These kinds of musical
practices were the most popular

00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:00.230
and most highly in demand.

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:03.560
The intersection of
countless African ethnicities

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:06.280
through the transatlantic
slave trade journey

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:10.500
and in the American crucible
created a new form of culture

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:13.630
that combined these
traditions with those

00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:16.160
of the English and
Native peoples.

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:18.650
And while these new
practices and traditions

00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:20.940
that were influenced
so effectively

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:25.230
by primarily these enslaved
Africans that culture

00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:30.240
as African-American novelist
Ralph Ellison noted was,

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:33.730
"more than the sum of
this brutalization."

00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:38.570
Instead, acknowledging
the impact of Africans

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:42.720
in the formation of American's
culture, is an affirmation

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:46.540
of life and the attitudes
of those who became part

00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:48.860
of the American experience.

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:52.400
And for those Africans
in American, the infusion

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:56.540
of their cultures into the
American landscape while

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:59.270
assimilating and
acculturating meant

00:37:59.270 --> 00:38:04.550
that they were an important
part of transforming, mutating

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:08.480
and even creating a
unique hybrid culture

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:11.150
that we call American.

00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:12.950
Thank you.

00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:19.500
[ Applause ]

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:28.470
&gt;&gt; Lynette Lewis Allston:
First, thank you to Dr. Braxton

00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:30.850
and to the Library of
Congress for allowing me

00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:37.330
to give you all the Native
perspective on early Virginia.

00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:42.840
From the arrival of the English
in 1607 until the 1619 arrival

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:47.070
of Africans and European women,
the world of the Native people

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:50.010
of Virginia was drastically
altered.

00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:54.270
The clash of cultures brought
disruption of lifestyle,

00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:57.230
loss of oral tradition
and language,

00:38:57.230 --> 00:39:00.220
assault of manifest
destiny on spiritual

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:02.540
and religious practices,

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:06.450
resulting in prejudice
and death.

00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:10.420
The challenge in explaining
how the Native population felt

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:12.110
about the arrival
of new people is

00:39:12.110 --> 00:39:16.690
to make my 21st century
unselfish view of living

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:18.290
in the early 17th century

00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:22.520
because Native people
transferred information

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:25.840
from generation to generation
through oral tradition.

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:30.810
Much of that information
has been lost.

00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:34.740
The sources of written
accounts from early times

00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:37.960
in Virginia are found
in personal writings

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:41.760
such as diaries and in the
collection of statutes and laws

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:45.650
that were created by those
who arrived at Jamestown.

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:48.610
Through time, much has been
written about the early times

00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:54.050
in Virginia by people who
have offered their analysis

00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:56.310
and perspective,
their speculation

00:39:56.310 --> 00:40:00.630
and their imagination to address
their views of the events.

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:05.480
In most cases, the people who
wrote about life in Jamestown

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:10.210
in the 17th century were not
altruistic in their accounts.

00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:15.210
They were people who had
more to gain than to give.

00:40:15.210 --> 00:40:17.800
Was the first reaction
by the Native tribes

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:20.600
that these newcomers
are here to harm?

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:24.270
Did their curiosity
about the first Europeans

00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:27.790
and then Africans overcome fear?

00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:31.970
Long before 1619, indigenous
communities were accustomed

00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:35.520
to the arrival of
persons from far away.

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:38.190
Usually, these travelers
were indigenous people

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:41.070
from other locales coming
for trade, and they were

00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:43.430
of similar skin color.

00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:46.040
They spoke languages that
at least some words could

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:47.940
be understood.

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:53.320
They came, they socialized,
they traded, and they left

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:55.870
to come again another time.

00:40:55.870 --> 00:41:00.510
These new visitors who came
by ships looked different,

00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:03.570
spoke an unknown
language and brought

00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:06.620
with them curiously
different goods.

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:10.610
Were they like the others
here to trade and depart?

00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:13.140
Or did they have a
different motive?

00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:15.590
In short order, it became
obvious that this group

00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:17.800
of strangers who brought
no women with them

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:19.500
in the first phase
were different

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:21.490
from previous visitors.

00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:25.980
Native curiosity was tempered
by an awareness of danger

00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:28.280
and soon turned to unease.

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:32.440
Unease turned to fear, and
fear turned to loathing.

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:38.510
By 1619, the reality of
conflict was a part of living

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:41.460
with the presence of people
who exhibited cultural biases

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:46.030
and invasive socioeconomic
goals.

00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:48.450
Within a short time of
arriving in Jamestown,

00:41:48.450 --> 00:41:51.310
the colonists were engaged
in the cycle of attacks

00:41:51.310 --> 00:41:55.820
and reprisals by the paladin
tribes who saw the reality

00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:59.590
that the arrival of these
new people was an invasion.

00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:03.910
Just 12 years after the arrival
of the strangers in 1607,

00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:07.860
the tribes saw the coming
of more unfamiliar arrivals,

00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:11.930
Africans, and finally
a few European women.

00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:14.890
The attack on the Native
population was not only

00:42:14.890 --> 00:42:17.040
physically with weapons
and disease,

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:21.630
there was also a cultural
attack with religion, education,

00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:24.480
gender roles, forced
apprenticeships

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:29.290
on Native children, forced
indenture, slavery and loss

00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:32.600
of identity through
paper genocide.

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:36.340
With the establishment of the
colonial government in 1619

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:39.760
and the meeting of the House
of Burgesses, the direction

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:45.390
for defining race and
class and separation began.

00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:48.590
Statutes at large, laws of
Virginia began the process

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:51.950
of creating barriers and
restrictions on those

00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:56.960
who were viewed by Angelo
men as being subordinate.

00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:00.310
This new societal strata
enhanced the evolution

00:43:00.310 --> 00:43:04.220
of interaction between
Native people, Africans,

00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:07.130
women and the indentured
population.

00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:09.350
Some of that interaction
was natural

00:43:09.350 --> 00:43:12.620
and voluntary, and
some was coerced.

00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:16.250
The laws of Virginia show that
English mindset towards Natives

00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:19.910
with citations, even
in the index of laws

00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:28.470
that created references that
say savages, "see Indians."

00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:32.020
The threat of quasi
slavery was ever present.

00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:34.490
In 1655, there's
a law that states

00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:38.890
if Indian parents bring their
children in as hostages,

00:43:38.890 --> 00:43:44.410
then choose the persons to
care for their children.

00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:47.460
They will not be used as slaves.

00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:51.720
But we will do our best to bring
them into Christianity, civility

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:54.320
and the knowledge
of necessary trades.

00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:58.290
Now this may sound like a
benevolent idea, but in reality,

00:43:58.290 --> 00:44:00.310
it is a method of acculturation.

00:44:00.310 --> 00:44:07.860
Also, in 1655, it was deemed "a
great scandal to Christianity,

00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:11.880
rendering religion
contemptable to buy an Indian.

00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:15.740
Yet, selling an Indian, who
had committed an infraction,

00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:17.250
was acceptable.

00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:21.350
As stated in a 1660 decision
that resulted from an accusation

00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:25.700
of damages done on English
property and states if they,

00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:30.310
the Indians, do not comply then
so many as the court think fit,

00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:32.940
shall be apprehended and sold

00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:36.960
into a foreign country
to satisfy the award.

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:39.540
Through a series of
violent confrontations,

00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:42.920
subsequent documents that the
colonial government labeled

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:47.850
as treaties, traditional Native
cultural patterns of trade,

00:44:47.850 --> 00:44:52.150
travel and even selection of
leadership, was transformed.

00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:53.740
Methods were instituted

00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:58.190
to control traditional
indigenous leadership structure.

00:44:58.190 --> 00:45:02.390
We read historical documents
which label various Natives

00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:05.900
as chiefs, queens, kings,
headmen, without realizing

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:09.750
that title terms were
generated by the colonists.

00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:11.970
As an example, in 1663,

00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:16.290
the colonial statute stated the
Indians shall not have the power

00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:18.070
within themselves to elect

00:45:18.070 --> 00:45:21.720
or constitute their
own chief commander.

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:23.670
But the present honorable
governor

00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:27.530
and his successors shall
authorize such person.

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:34.270
By the time of Nathanial Bacon's
oddly-named rebellion in 1676,

00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:38.340
those who fought could keep
a captured Native as a reward

00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:41.800
for assisting and
attacking the Occaneechi.

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:43.660
Field historians
have acknowledged

00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:47.410
that Nathanial Bacon's primary
objective was to disrupt one

00:45:47.410 --> 00:45:50.990
of the largest pre-Anglo
trading centers near present-day

00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:53.230
Clarksville, Virginia.

00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:57.070
By decimating the Occaneechi,
Bacon was positioning himself

00:45:57.070 --> 00:46:02.000
and other Anglos to control
a major historical indigenous

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.960
trade route.

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:07.880
Accurate history is filled
with unpleasant realities.

00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:11.880
And I acknowledge this because
a segment of my own tribe,

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:13.940
the Nottoway, assisted Bacon

00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:17.060
in the slaughter
of the Occaneechis.

00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:20.480
If we seek historical
reconciliation, we must be open

00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:25.610
to addressing immoral
ambiguity and unpleasantries.

00:46:25.610 --> 00:46:29.700
There was an ongoing and
everchanging list of early laws

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:33.280
on anti-miscegenation, birth
of mixed-race children,

00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:36.040
trade with Natives,
Natives traveling

00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:41.510
through land appropriate
by colonists and more.

00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:46.200
The most obvious and sensitive
issue is disparate consideration

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:48.670
of racial intermarriage.

00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:51.010
The way we looked,
the visual appearance

00:46:51.010 --> 00:46:54.380
of the Native population, had
much to do with the attraction

00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:57.620
for interaction between
Natives and Africans.

00:46:57.620 --> 00:46:59.670
An example of appearances
provided

00:46:59.670 --> 00:47:03.480
in the 1700s diary
of William Bird.

00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:06.780
Bird visited the Nottoway
great town during his travels

00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:11.500
to survey the border between
Virginia and North Carolina.

00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:16.030
Bird described the Nottoway
as people of mahogany skins

00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:20.300
and the copper colored
ones of Nottoway town.

00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:24.650
He described the Nottoway this
way long before an extensive

00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:29.400
intermarriage with Nottoway with
either Europeans or Africans.

00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:31.630
Over time, the Nottoway
did intermarry

00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:34.210
with Europeans and Africans.

00:47:34.210 --> 00:47:37.430
We can assume that there
was an inclination of people

00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:41.890
of darker skin tones who
were viewed and had to act,

00:47:41.890 --> 00:47:43.660
and were acted upon
as subordinate

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:48.390
to establish common bonds
for safety and survival.

00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:51.300
To that end, the
Nottoway tribe who lived

00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:55.230
in the 1700s were
living on 40,000 acres

00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:58.820
of reservation land,
provided safe haven

00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:02.520
for segments of displaced
tribes.

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:05.400
Escaped slaves and
runaway indentures,

00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:09.200
also found save haven
on that reservation.

00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:12.000
At the time that Bird was
surveying the Virginia North

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.700
Carolina dividing line, the
Weyanoke Tribe had been removed

00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:18.740
from its territory
from the James River.

00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:22.730
In a deposition of Henry
Briggs in 1711, Briggs states

00:48:22.730 --> 00:48:24.630
that the Weyanoke live
on Wyocake [phonetic]

00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:29.540
on the Nottoway River and have
paid the Nottoway much peak

00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:30.840
to live there.

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:33.490
At the same time,
segments of other tribes,

00:48:33.490 --> 00:48:36.510
including Meherrin,
Nansemond and Tuscarora came

00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:38.630
to live with the Nottoway.

00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:41.640
The Nottoway 40,000-acre
reservation was a buffer

00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:44.520
against Anglo conflicts
with the Tuscarora

00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:46.800
who were stridently resistant

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:49.810
to colonial usurpation
of their land.

00:48:49.810 --> 00:48:53.380
The Nottoway reservation was
in present day South Hampton

00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:55.660
and Sussex County in Virginia.

00:48:55.660 --> 00:49:00.770
With the loss of territory,
some Virginia natives were able

00:49:00.770 --> 00:49:03.040
to survive by living
on reservation,

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:06.050
and others became servants
and laborers on land

00:49:06.050 --> 00:49:08.370
that was once their own.

00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:11.230
In the 19th century, the
Nottoway took allotments

00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:14.560
of reservation land and
became individual landowners.

00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:18.450
Yet, as individual landowners,
we were subject to taxes.

00:49:18.450 --> 00:49:22.180
And if we did not pay those
taxes, we were subject

00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:24.980
to involuntary indenture.

00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:29.610
1619 was the pinnacle
marker for racial

00:49:29.610 --> 00:49:32.790
and gender discrimination
laws that compounded

00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:38.060
and impacted Native identity
into the 20th century.

00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:42.430
Native people traditionally had
a balanced view of gender roles

00:49:42.430 --> 00:49:44.360
and the importance of women.

00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:45.660
Native women were involved

00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:48.710
as decision makers
in tribal structure.

00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:52.160
As time passed, Native
identity was transitioned

00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:56.070
to other designations
based on skin color.

00:49:56.070 --> 00:50:00.620
In Virginia, paper genocide
systematically categorized

00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:04.630
Natives as people of color
and erased Native identity

00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:07.810
on census records
and legal documents.

00:50:07.810 --> 00:50:12.010
The Racial Integrity Act of
1924 in its implementation

00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:15.800
by Walter Plecker as head of
the Bureau of Vital Statistics

00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:19.700
for Virginia mandated that
there were only two races

00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:23.160
in Virginia, white and colored.

00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:28.430
The Racial Integrity
Act remained until 1967,

00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:30.440
when the US Supreme
Court in Loving

00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:35.250
versus Virginia found the law
prohibiting interracial marriage

00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:37.220
to be unconstitutional.

00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:42.350
A subsequent change in
Virginia law restored identity

00:50:42.350 --> 00:50:44.370
and allowed birth certificates

00:50:44.370 --> 00:50:48.760
of Virginia tribal
members to be corrected.

00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:53.640
In today's world, I remind
citizens of my tribe,

00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:57.230
including one that's sitting
on the front row over here,

00:50:57.230 --> 00:51:00.830
that the Nottoway
Indian Tribe of Virginia,

00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:06.090
that our first family
were Native people.

00:51:06.090 --> 00:51:10.110
And that anyone else who
came along simply joined us,

00:51:10.110 --> 00:51:12.970
and that made us
who we are today.

00:51:12.970 --> 00:51:14.770
Thank you.

00:51:14.770 --> 00:51:22.500
[ Applause ]

00:51:34.270 --> 00:51:36.290
&gt;&gt; Joanne M. Braxton:
Thank you Trent, Cassandra

00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:40.710
and Lynette, and I am last.

00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:45.930
Today I'm going to speak
about just a very small part

00:51:45.930 --> 00:51:49.960
of my work here at
the Kluge Center.

00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:55.020
And my larger project on
African-American spirituality

00:51:55.020 --> 00:52:02.380
and health is on view under
the title At the Crossroads

00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:07.290
of Spirituality and Health
on the Kluge Center website.

00:52:08.410 --> 00:52:13.800
So, today's talk is red-black,

00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:19.350
spirit medicine in
the Chesapeake.

00:52:19.350 --> 00:52:24.770
Origins of the Weyanoke,
1619 to the present.

00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:28.630
And this slide show is just
going to run while I talk.

00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:30.590
Because there's so
much information,

00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:35.220
you can't possibly do justice
to it in a few minutes.

00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:38.140
The slides will help.

00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:41.470
Many of these are from
professional photographers

00:52:41.470 --> 00:52:47.550
of Faith Charity Nelson
and also Valena Dismukes.

00:52:47.550 --> 00:52:52.290
Also Allan Alston and
Rebecca Parker, who are here,

00:52:52.290 --> 00:52:55.270
contributed some of the slides.

00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:59.120
And you'll see one image
by Rose Paliton [phonetic],

00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:02.590
the artist who is
sitting in the front row.

00:53:02.590 --> 00:53:08.400
And if you can't tell who that
is, just look to the front row

00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:12.640
and there is someone who looks
most decidedly like an artist.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.480
So welcome, dear friend, Rose.

00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:21.590
Red Black Spirit Medicine.

00:53:21.590 --> 00:53:30.510
This story is personal and at
the same time representative

00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:36.870
of the spiritual journey of
many persons of mixed triracial

00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:39.980
or red-black heritage.

00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:43.180
Perhaps for me, it
begins in my childhood

00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:46.180
in Prince George's
County, Maryland.

00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:51.400
On the banks of a stream
that fed the Anacostia River.

00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:54.350
Long before I ever thought
about being a scholar

00:53:54.350 --> 00:53:57.420
of African-American
literature and culture.

00:53:57.420 --> 00:54:05.720
When I was a child, we lived
in a house in the woods just

00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:08.970
on the banks of Indian Creek.

00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:11.930
The boundary between our black

00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:17.430
and mixed-race community
and another world.

00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:21.320
A world that was largely white.

00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:24.040
But throughout this region

00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:29.430
in the time before there was a
beltway, there were communities

00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:37.110
like ours with tightly
interwoven kinship relations.

00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:41.860
My father taught me how
to cup my hands to drink

00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:46.560
from a metal bucket
or clear spring.

00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:54.190
How to set traps for rabbits
and how to find the North Star.

00:54:54.190 --> 00:55:00.500
The older men moved like shadows
in and out of the forest,

00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:07.940
emerging with squirrel, rabbits
and occasionally other game.

00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:15.310
I roamed the woods and wetlands,
watchful for water moccasins

00:55:15.310 --> 00:55:19.420
and dangerous sinkholes.

00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:24.500
We farmed the land
growing corn, beans,

00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:28.330
squash and occasionally melon.

00:55:28.330 --> 00:55:31.850
We caught and cooked the
eels from Indian Creek,

00:55:31.850 --> 00:55:38.870
frying them up in hot grease to
eat with hominy and succotash.

00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:45.190
In the spring, my father's
mother would prepare a physic

00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:50.570
of pokeweed, a poisonous
plant that I learned

00:55:50.570 --> 00:55:56.960
to pick before its
purple berries formed.

00:55:56.960 --> 00:56:00.550
And Dad would head down
into Southern Maryland

00:56:00.550 --> 00:56:03.850
with my mother's Gus
and butler cousins

00:56:03.850 --> 00:56:07.210
for the spring herring run.

00:56:07.210 --> 00:56:11.590
Dad and Cousin Amos Gus
caught lots of herring,

00:56:11.590 --> 00:56:17.670
and they salted them down
and preserved in a barrel.

00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:23.410
Only later did I learn that the
food practices of my family,

00:56:23.410 --> 00:56:26.930
such as the salting of
herring and the growing

00:56:26.930 --> 00:56:31.980
of the three sisters
were tangible signs

00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:38.480
of the cultural interaction
of red and black people.

00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:43.690
My mother's mother
was a red-brown woman

00:56:43.690 --> 00:56:50.880
who could heal ailments
with plants from the forest.

00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:54.490
This she learned from
her grandmother, Nana,

00:56:54.490 --> 00:57:00.230
who as my grandmother told
me, had long black hair,

00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:02.980
hair long enough to sit on.

00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:05.420
From my paternal grandmother,

00:57:05.420 --> 00:57:10.330
I learned about my great-great
grandfather Peyton Harrison,

00:57:10.330 --> 00:57:15.710
Black and Indian who
came up from Virginia.

00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:20.490
He told my grandmother
that his people were some

00:57:20.490 --> 00:57:24.090
of the Jamestown Africans.

00:57:25.450 --> 00:57:30.270
Sometimes, as I roam
through the woods or dug clay

00:57:30.270 --> 00:57:36.040
from the stream bank, I did
wonder where the Indians

00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:41.530
for whom Indian Creek
was named had gone.

00:57:41.530 --> 00:57:44.710
But then my mind would
return to the present

00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:50.260
and the pending threat of
integration, which had not

00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:56.170
yet occurred but
was looming over us.

00:57:56.170 --> 00:57:58.420
In those days, colored children

00:57:58.420 --> 00:58:02.040
from Southern Prince George's
County came all the way

00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:08.110
up into Lakeland to attend
our Colored Lakeland School.

00:58:08.110 --> 00:58:13.570
No one was black back then.

00:58:13.570 --> 00:58:20.060
We were all Colored with a
capital C. Call somebody Black,

00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:24.080
you're going to start a fight.

00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:26.320
Those proctored [phonetic]
children,

00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:29.170
they didn't associate
with us much.

00:58:29.170 --> 00:58:33.220
We thought they were strange
with their straight hair

00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:37.070
and their standoff ways.

00:58:37.070 --> 00:58:39.150
Only recently did
I learn that many

00:58:39.150 --> 00:58:41.330
of the proctors now
self-identify

00:58:41.330 --> 00:58:43.830
as Piscataway Indians.

00:58:43.830 --> 00:58:47.520
And only when urban renewal
conspired to take what I thought

00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:52.600
of our land there on
Indian Creek did I begin

00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:58.500
to appreciate the convergence
of things I had seen

00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:02.500
and the stories I had heard.

00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:07.240
It was these stories of my
ancestors in the Chesapeake

00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:12.180
that fueled my desire to
learn more about the Weyanoke,

00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:17.280
both as a scholar and as
a symbolic descendant.

00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:24.250
In time, I learned that Weyanoke
is at once a people, a place

00:59:24.250 --> 00:59:31.070
or places and incorporated
association and ritual ground

00:59:31.070 --> 00:59:36.070
where the collective historical
trauma of colonialism.

00:59:36.070 --> 00:59:40.290
The enslavement of black and
Native people and the trauma

00:59:40.290 --> 00:59:45.740
of separation and
exclusion gets repaired

00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:50.870
through collective
healing prayers, music,

00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:54.340
ritual and the intentional
coming together

00:59:54.340 --> 01:00:00.910
of persons prepared to
celebrate red-black connections.

01:00:00.910 --> 01:00:07.440
The name Weyanoke itself means
sassafras, a medicinal tree used

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:08.780
for healing purposes

01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:14.390
by indigenous people
transported Africans

01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:18.310
and European colonists alike.

01:00:18.310 --> 01:00:23.170
And today, the Weyanoke
Association is first

01:00:23.170 --> 01:00:27.480
and foremost a site of healing.

01:00:30.050 --> 01:00:34.170
The Chesapeake or Great
Shellfish Bay was the site

01:00:34.170 --> 01:00:37.490
of the Weyanoke Plantation
in Virginia,

01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:40.640
where the first Africans in
the English Americas lived

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:45.360
in community dating from 1619.

01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:49.490
Transported to the Chesapeake
region through Point Comfort,

01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:53.310
near present-day Hampton
and from thence to Jamestown

01:00:53.310 --> 01:00:57.300
and from there on to the
Weyanoke Plantation named

01:00:57.300 --> 01:01:01.100
for the indigenous
people who lived nearby,

01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:08.440
the 1619 Angolan Africans began
their lives in close proximity

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:13.080
to an Algonquian-speaking
people whose ancestors had been

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:19.630
in the region for at least
1,600 years before the English

01:01:19.630 --> 01:01:22.850
colonizers arrived.

01:01:22.850 --> 01:01:27.400
The Africans learned to hunt
and fish with the Weyanoke,

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:29.990
lighting fires in
their canoes at night

01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:34.470
to warm their hands
and to attract fish.

01:01:34.470 --> 01:01:36.550
There were many similarities

01:01:36.550 --> 01:01:38.550
between the indigenous
read people

01:01:38.550 --> 01:01:41.750
and the transported Africans.

01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:46.050
Each was subjected to
"colonialism, social disorder

01:01:46.050 --> 01:01:48.000
and upheaval for
hundreds of years

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.610
and to being called savages.

01:01:50.610 --> 01:01:54.250
The object of this immense and
intense culture interaction

01:01:54.250 --> 01:01:59.150
and it's resultant degradation
is the Weyanoke Association

01:01:59.150 --> 01:02:05.110
website points out, was
to take the red man's land

01:02:05.110 --> 01:02:10.250
and use the black man's
labor to work that land."

01:02:10.250 --> 01:02:15.260
On the positive side,

01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:20.160
the indigenous Native
American people

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:24.150
and Africans alike had oral
traditions that allowed

01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:27.330
for the preservation of
ancestry and records.

01:02:27.330 --> 01:02:29.700
And the conveying of
identity and knowledge

01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:34.000
through the cultivation
of deep listening skill

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.970
and respect for the elders.

01:02:36.970 --> 01:02:40.890
These were skills that
could spell the difference

01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:45.940
between physical
survival and annihilation.

01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:50.080
As folkways had the power to
give direction and guidance

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:52.540
from ancestral knowledge,

01:02:52.540 --> 01:02:57.520
even when no ancestor
was physically present.

01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:00.930
And in many ways, the
Africans' spirituality

01:03:00.930 --> 01:03:04.920
and cosmology may have
been compatible with that

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:07.890
of their original
indigenous hosts,

01:03:07.890 --> 01:03:10.890
along with their musical
traditions and practices

01:03:10.890 --> 01:03:14.500
of midwifery or biology
and other forms

01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:17.070
of traditional healing.

01:03:17.070 --> 01:03:20.720
Both peoples had
priests, conjurers,

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:24.010
diviners and midwives.

01:03:24.010 --> 01:03:25.850
Each had a closeness

01:03:25.850 --> 01:03:32.790
and an interdependent
relationship to the land.

01:03:32.790 --> 01:03:35.870
By following the language
of the way that black

01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:40.390
and red people are described
in colonial Virginia laws,

01:03:40.390 --> 01:03:44.880
it is possible to see how
ideas of race changed over time

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:49.550
and were used as tools
to divide two people

01:03:49.550 --> 01:03:52.180
who had much in common.

01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:58.010
As documented by Arica Coleman
in her award-winning book,

01:03:58.010 --> 01:04:01.310
That the Blood Stay
Pure, African-Americans,

01:04:01.310 --> 01:04:04.390
Native-Americans and the
predicament of identity

01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:09.410
in Virginia, relations between
indigenous persons and persons

01:04:09.410 --> 01:04:14.670
of African dissent in Virginia
have often been troubled

01:04:14.670 --> 01:04:19.330
with Virginia's Racial Purity
Act disrupting relationships

01:04:19.330 --> 01:04:25.180
among individuals,
families, churches and tribes.

01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:30.510
Today, the Weyanoke Association
founded by Hugh and Anita Herald

01:04:30.510 --> 01:04:37.860
in 1999 on the 380th anniversary
of the landing of Africans

01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:44.150
in Virginia has become a site
of memory and spiritual healing

01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:49.700
for those simultaneously
remembering, navigating

01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:55.940
and reconciling with this
rich and complicated past.

01:04:55.940 --> 01:05:01.580
When I speak of red-black
spirit medicine, I am speaking

01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:08.240
of medicine that originates with
red or black people that is good

01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:14.310
for black-red people, or anyone
else who needs the physical,

01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:17.170
emotional or psychological care

01:05:17.170 --> 01:05:21.790
that red-black spirit
medicine can provide.

01:05:21.790 --> 01:05:25.170
Think of it as complementary
care

01:05:25.170 --> 01:05:28.660
for the body, mind and spirit.

01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:34.600
Think of it as redress, to
use Saidiya Hartman's term,

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:39.280
or soul repair for the
intersecting layers of violence

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:45.020
and historical trauma and spirit
murder, to borrow from the work

01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:49.830
of Nell Painter and later
Kelly Brown Douglas.

01:05:49.830 --> 01:05:52.750
The work of Jack Saul has shown

01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:56.800
that collective trauma
is often best addressed

01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:59.810
in community with others.

01:05:59.810 --> 01:06:02.780
That is what the Weyanoke
Association achieves

01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:07.580
in their annual coming
together gatherings and powwows.

01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:12.460
The healing may attract
physical health, excuse me,

01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:16.840
may impact physical
health or just the spirit.

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:20.810
I felt that healing personally

01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:25.960
when Hugh Harrell poured a
fresh pot of sassafras tea,

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:31.010
and we sat down in a home rich
with art and ritual objects

01:06:31.010 --> 01:06:34.710
from both African and
indigenous culture.

01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:41.450
And Anita Harrell read
a poem called It isn't

01:06:41.450 --> 01:06:43.760
Identity Politics.

01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:48.650
Here's the poem.

01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:52.710
I am Anita Harrell.

01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:55.730
I am Moon Dancer.

01:06:55.730 --> 01:07:00.150
I am the daughter of Allene
[phonetic] Davis Alan.

01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:05.400
I am the daughter of
Annie Miles Davis Heron.

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:09.560
I am the great-granddaughter
of N.E. [phonetic] Smith Miles.

01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:14.090
I am the great-great
granddaughter of Lavenia Smith.

01:07:14.090 --> 01:07:17.190
Because of them, I am Shoshone.

01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:20.030
Because of them, I am loved.

01:07:20.030 --> 01:07:23.010
Because of them, I am strong.

01:07:23.010 --> 01:07:28.530
Because of them, I
am who I say I am.

01:07:28.530 --> 01:07:30.680
I am Moon Dancer.

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:33.360
I am Anita Harrel.

01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:34.660
Who are you?

01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:45.310
And then she said, if you
use a blood quantum approach,

01:07:45.310 --> 01:07:51.490
you are essentially
committing suicide, end quote.

01:07:51.490 --> 01:07:54.270
Hugh, a descendant
of many generations

01:07:54.270 --> 01:07:57.180
of Charles City County
red-blacks agrees.

01:07:57.180 --> 01:08:01.170
He says, we've been doing
what we've been doing

01:08:01.170 --> 01:08:03.180
because we had to.

01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:05.210
There's no emphasis
in local schools

01:08:05.210 --> 01:08:09.170
on teaching children
their history.

01:08:09.170 --> 01:08:14.600
Anita added, I know
Erica started her work,

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:19.710
this is Dr. Arica Coleman, I
know Erica started her work

01:08:19.710 --> 01:08:22.920
after coming to one
of our gatherings.

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:26.340
There's an alignment
with the ancestors.

01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:32.720
Things happening beyond
our control, end quote.

01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:35.520
Each year, on the second
Saturday in August,

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:38.140
to coincide with the
anniversary of their arrival

01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:40.670
of the first Africans
in Virginia,

01:08:40.670 --> 01:08:43.700
the Weyanoke Association
sponsors the Coming Together

01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:49.850
Festival, the Lincoln legacy of
Native and African-Americans.

01:08:49.850 --> 01:08:51.610
To embark on a journey

01:08:51.610 --> 01:08:54.570
to a Weyanoke Coming
Together Festival,

01:08:54.570 --> 01:08:58.980
one must leave physically
the spaces and places

01:08:58.980 --> 01:09:04.030
of colonization and go into the
wilderness, up into the woods

01:09:04.030 --> 01:09:06.650
in Charles City County
or Surry County

01:09:06.650 --> 01:09:10.510
into historically
red and black spaces.

01:09:10.510 --> 01:09:14.410
One leaves Richmond, the
capital of the Confederacy

01:09:14.410 --> 01:09:17.410
or colonial Williamsburg,
literally

01:09:17.410 --> 01:09:20.940
and historically the
colonial capital.

01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:23.810
From Williamsburg,
one drives west

01:09:23.810 --> 01:09:27.680
on Route 5 past Weyanoke
Plantation

01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:32.030
where Yardley hid most of
the 19 Angolan Africans

01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:36.390
who were imported illegally
into Jamestown in 1619.

01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:39.070
And then on past
Berkley Plantation

01:09:39.070 --> 01:09:42.660
where Benjamin Harrison
traded extensively

01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:45.060
with indigenous people.

01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:48.170
And some Weyanoke
people lived in houses

01:09:48.170 --> 01:09:51.730
on that Harrison property.

01:09:51.730 --> 01:09:57.440
There, on the Weyanoke
Peninsula, just five miles

01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:01.430
from the place where the
indentured Africans formed their

01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:04.160
first community.

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:08.450
In fact, many of the Coming
Together gatherings have been

01:10:08.450 --> 01:10:12.860
held as the Harrison
National Fish Hatcheries,

01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:15.870
part of the original
Harrison Estate,

01:10:15.870 --> 01:10:20.630
which keeps the historical
continuities tight.

01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:24.840
To go to Coming Together, one
travels through greenspaces

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:28.600
and through symbolic geography
and psychic landscapes

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:32.980
to become removed,
sheltered and inoculated.

01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:36.260
To claim and be reclaimed.

01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:41.510
Once arrived, the healing can
begin in ways large and small

01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:45.990
in spaces where the mind
can begin to be decolonized,

01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:49.340
and everyone is invited
to break bread

01:10:49.340 --> 01:10:53.310
and enjoy the transcendent
rhythms of sacred drums,

01:10:53.310 --> 01:10:55.780
healing songs and chants,

01:10:55.780 --> 01:11:00.130
processions honoring the
ancestors and dancing.

01:11:00.130 --> 01:11:05.350
The protocol of Coming
Together includes both African

01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:08.170
and Native elements.

01:11:08.170 --> 01:11:10.250
Everyone is welcome.

01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:15.650
But one must be intentional
about the choice

01:11:15.650 --> 01:11:19.580
to make the journey to go there.

01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:21.760
Walking in a Weyanoke procession

01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:23.820
and hearing the transcendent
rhythms

01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:27.700
of two cultures can
be a powerful source

01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:29.960
of reconnection and renewal.

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:35.720
Especially for one who
has read in black roots.

01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:38.110
There is medicine in
the knowledge shared,

01:11:38.110 --> 01:11:42.560
in the smudging, in the
libations, in the prayers,

01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:45.830
in the food, in the belonging.

01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:48.510
For me, the Who's Afraid

01:11:48.510 --> 01:11:59.100
of Black Indians poems,
talk about a slip.

01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:04.230
For me, the Who's Afraid
of Black Indians poems

01:12:04.230 --> 01:12:11.900
of Weyanoke Association member
Shonda Buchanan are restorative.

01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:14.750
Not unlike the narrative
medicine I've taught

01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:19.450
at William &amp; Mary and Eastern
Virginia Medical School,

01:12:19.450 --> 01:12:22.410
there is more medicine
in the photographs

01:12:22.410 --> 01:12:28.110
of Faith Charity Nelson
and Valena Dismukes

01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:30.810
and in the paintings
of Rose Paliton

01:12:30.810 --> 01:12:35.530
and the pottery of
Lynnette Allston.

01:12:35.530 --> 01:12:40.120
Beyond this, Anita Harrell
has taken her healing rituals

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:45.200
into her work as a family
system's constellations therapy

01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:50.360
facilitator, and similar
therapies were recently employed

01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:56.440
in a Braxton Institute advanced
training seminar for 100 helpers

01:12:56.440 --> 01:13:00.670
and healers seeking
training in moral injury

01:13:00.670 --> 01:13:06.140
and collective healing
in September 2017.

01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:07.440
African-American

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:13.830
and Native-American healers have
access to knowledge, culture

01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:19.860
and power when we stand in our
own medicine and our own truth.

01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:24.090
I conclude with a prayer

01:13:24.090 --> 01:13:27.930
from the Weyanoke
Association website.

01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:35.570
We give thanks to the
Creator for each new day.

01:13:35.570 --> 01:13:41.030
We give thanks to the
ancestors who watch over us.

01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:47.390
We give thanks to our Mother
Earth who sustains us.

01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:51.740
We give thanks to our brothers
and sisters, the plants

01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:57.910
and animals, who give our lives
so that ours may continue.

01:13:57.910 --> 01:14:01.880
We give thanks to the
people who've work,

01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:05.190
care and love nourish us.

01:14:05.190 --> 01:14:11.680
We give thanks that [inaudible]
and Turtle Island meet in us.

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:16.270
We give thanks to the Creator
for all of these gifts.

01:14:16.270 --> 01:14:20.940
May they be transformed into
positive thoughts, careful

01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:28.190
and kind words, appropriate
and effective deeds.

01:14:28.190 --> 01:14:32.470
Aho [phonetic], [Foreign
Language] Amen.

01:14:32.470 --> 01:14:34.150
&gt;&gt; Aho.

01:14:34.150 --> 01:14:37.210
&gt;&gt; Joanne M. Braxton: Aho.

01:14:37.210 --> 01:14:39.510
Thank you.

01:14:39.510 --> 01:14:51.520
[ Applause ]

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:55.970
I'm going to shift now to
our panel discussion mode.

01:15:05.090 --> 01:15:08.060
There's no graceful way
to pick up index cards.

01:15:10.690 --> 01:15:20.280
Before we get started, I would
like to acknowledge the presence

01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:25.130
of Nancy Rodriguez and
Uri [phonetic] Mulligan

01:15:25.130 --> 01:15:31.210
from Commemoration 2918,
American Evolution.

01:15:31.210 --> 01:15:33.010
Would you please stand up?

01:15:33.010 --> 01:15:38.240
[ Applause ]

01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:42.250
Thank you for your
support of this program.

01:15:42.250 --> 01:15:45.340
Dr. Newby-Alexander,
we began working

01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:48.540
on our collaborative 2019
commemoration efforts

01:15:48.540 --> 01:15:52.730
in preparation for the 400th
anniversary of 1619 way back

01:15:52.730 --> 01:16:00.770
in 2012 when we collectively
convened the first 1619

01:16:00.770 --> 01:16:04.540
and Making of America conference
at Norfolk State University.

01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:08.750
Since that time, we have
constituted ourselves

01:16:08.750 --> 01:16:11.320
as a learning community,
a kind of think tank

01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:15.050
for revisiting the discussion
of 1619 and its impact

01:16:15.050 --> 01:16:19.000
and significance in
American history.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.960
So our team has been
working on this for years.

01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:25.450
Why?

01:16:25.450 --> 01:16:27.010
&gt;&gt; Cassandra Newby-Alexander:
You know,

01:16:27.010 --> 01:16:29.320
it is a difficult story.

01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:32.450
What we have to do is
deconstruct the way

01:16:32.450 --> 01:16:36.560
in which we see our
nation's history.

01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:39.880
The center of the
story has focused

01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:43.190
on the European descendants.

01:16:43.190 --> 01:16:49.740
And everyone else has been
left out or completely ignored.

01:16:49.740 --> 01:16:53.760
And so we brought together
not only scholars but people

01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:58.210
in the community to
tell a different story.

01:16:58.210 --> 01:17:01.880
To tell a story that's
really who we are.

01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:06.420
And we started with asking the
question, who are we really?

01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:09.330
And all you have to do
is peel back the layers

01:17:09.330 --> 01:17:13.520
of your own family's
history and legacy to know

01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:17.810
that the story you tell your
children is not the real story.

01:17:17.810 --> 01:17:19.500
You tell the good.

01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:23.410
You tell the part of that
story that makes you proud,

01:17:23.410 --> 01:17:27.030
that makes you feel
like you have ownership.

01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:29.660
But our story is
much more complex.

01:17:29.660 --> 01:17:32.700
And so in retelling a story,

01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:35.410
in pulling all the
different layers out,

01:17:35.410 --> 01:17:37.420
the need to be removed,

01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:41.790
and putting into that
narrative what really needs

01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:44.260
to be there, it takes a while.

01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:48.050
And as you can see even
in today's politics,

01:17:48.050 --> 01:17:50.680
people are afraid of that story.

01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:53.570
But that's the story
that makes us strong.

01:17:53.570 --> 01:17:56.410
That's the story
that makes us unique.

01:17:56.410 --> 01:18:01.550
That should be the story
that makes us proud.

01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:02.850
&gt;&gt; Joanne M. Braxton: Thank you.

01:18:02.850 --> 01:18:10.970
In connection with the original
2012 1619 and the Making

01:18:10.970 --> 01:18:14.690
of America conference
at Norfolk State,

01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:19.390
I interviewed Dr. Maya Angelou,
and I'd like to bring her

01:18:19.390 --> 01:18:24.930
into the room with us right now.

01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:36.640
I asked why should 1619 be on
our minds as we face forward

01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:40.030
into the 400th anniversary
of the arrival of Africans

01:18:40.030 --> 01:18:42.930
and women in the English
colony of Virginia?

01:18:42.930 --> 01:18:46.700
What are the enduring
questions raised

01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:49.250
by this pivotal moment in time?

01:18:49.250 --> 01:18:56.440
And now, I'm quoting Dr.
Maya Angelou who said,

01:18:56.440 --> 01:19:02.500
"We have an old saying that has
become a cliché and that is,

01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:04.630
you can't know where
you're going unless you know

01:19:04.630 --> 01:19:06.900
where you've been.

01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:09.450
It is imperative," she said,

01:19:09.450 --> 01:19:12.490
"that all Americans
recognize the imprint

01:19:12.490 --> 01:19:14.320
of the first Africans
brought here

01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:18.400
and the first white women
brought here in bondage.

01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:20.770
I'm trying to say
that the word slavery

01:19:20.770 --> 01:19:26.270
and the term enslavement has
lost so much of its weight,

01:19:26.270 --> 01:19:28.050
until the people mouth the words

01:19:28.050 --> 01:19:33.030
without realizing what they're
saying, what they're calling up.

01:19:33.030 --> 01:19:37.540
When you read the history of
the enslavement, the hundreds

01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:40.720
of years of enslavement,
it's too dreadful

01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:42.380
to have even been included

01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:44.930
in Alex Haley's phenomena
the book Roots

01:19:44.930 --> 01:19:49.440
and the television phenomena
Roots in which I," Maya Angelou

01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:53.370
"played Kunta Kinte's
grandmother.

01:19:53.370 --> 01:19:55.140
Too bizarre.

01:19:55.140 --> 01:19:57.840
Too horrible," she says.

01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:03.230
"And yet, we have to face
it or we will never get rid

01:20:03.230 --> 01:20:07.740
of this blight of racism and
guilt and hate which assembles

01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:11.090
in our race in the
21st century."

01:20:11.090 --> 01:20:19.320
Panelists, do you
agree with Dr. Angelou?

01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:21.980
Why or why not?

01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:25.830
What do you feel are the
enduring questions raised

01:20:25.830 --> 01:20:32.160
by 1619 for those of
us still here in 2018?

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:36.970
Is 2019 another pivotal moment?

01:20:36.970 --> 01:20:44.000
How can having access to the
past, and in particular, 1619,

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.970
help us understand the present?

01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:53.030
&gt;&gt; Who first?

01:20:53.030 --> 01:20:54.330
&gt;&gt; Joanne M. Braxton:
Dr. Vinson.

01:20:54.330 --> 01:20:55.630
&gt;&gt; Robert Trent Vinson:
I'll take a stab at that.

01:20:55.630 --> 01:20:56.930
Let's see.

01:20:56.930 --> 01:21:00.570
So, 2019 is the 400th
anniversary of 1619,

01:21:00.570 --> 01:21:02.240
which we're talking about.

01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:06.000
And so it gives a chance to talk
about Jamestown and to put it

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.250
into context in terms
of the world.

01:21:09.250 --> 01:21:13.110
Because on some level,
Jamestown and the context

01:21:13.110 --> 01:21:16.710
of the Atlantic slave
trade was peripheral.

01:21:16.710 --> 01:21:19.540
I already mentioned 500,000
Africans had already come

01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:21.410
across the water.

01:21:21.410 --> 01:21:25.450
Only 6% of Africans coming
across the water actually came

01:21:25.450 --> 01:21:27.520
to what became the
United States.

01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:30.370
The vast majority, over
90%, went to South America,

01:21:30.370 --> 01:21:33.150
Central America and
the Caribbean.

01:21:33.150 --> 01:21:40.070
Yet, what developed starting
from Jamestown was ultimately

01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:43.520
by 1860, the largest slave
society in world history,

01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:47.300
four million enslaved
people, right.

01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:51.860
And we have to deal with
that dynamic of how it was

01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:54.870
that a system of slavery that
has been a global phenomena,

01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:58.590
it's in all the ancient
societies,

01:21:58.590 --> 01:22:01.000
became so heavily race-based.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:05.330
And the system of slavery which
has a classic component, right,

01:22:05.330 --> 01:22:08.960
appropriating labor to generate
profit for someone else,

01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:12.720
included a racial component
now to create this kind

01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:18.650
of racial caste system that
in many ways survived slavery

01:22:18.650 --> 01:22:20.150
in a legal sense.

01:22:20.150 --> 01:22:25.320
And so Jamestown gives
us a chance to reflect

01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:31.240
and shift the narrative, because
if we look at 1619 and we go

01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:36.540
to 1865, that's 246 years of
slavery, which is more years

01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:39.300
than of freedom in this country.

01:22:39.300 --> 01:22:42.060
And then if you look at
those years of freedom,

01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:46.840
the great majority of that time,
over 100 years, is Jim Crow.

01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:51.300
So when we talk about
Jamestown being the beginning

01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:53.850
of democracy, that's
from the perspective

01:22:53.850 --> 01:22:56.790
of propertied white men.

01:22:56.790 --> 01:23:01.300
Democracy is a rather new
thing in America I would argue.

01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:03.410
I would argue that we might
have to start thinking

01:23:03.410 --> 01:23:08.850
about democracy perhaps with
the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

01:23:08.850 --> 01:23:15.220
And even then, it's a fragile
thing as we've come to know.

01:23:16.330 --> 01:23:19.620
So we have the largest
prison population

01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:21.460
in world history as well.

01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:24.120
And we know those who
are branded as felons,

01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:26.490
even after they've served
their time and paid their debt

01:23:26.490 --> 01:23:31.130
to society, still very difficult
to get their voting rights back

01:23:31.130 --> 01:23:32.430
and other rights as well.

01:23:32.430 --> 01:23:38.920
So 2019 gives us a moment
to reflect on where we are

01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:42.860
in America and where
America is in the world.

01:23:42.860 --> 01:23:47.380
That's the best I can do
with such a deep question.

01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:49.510
&gt;&gt; That's the best you can do?

01:23:49.510 --> 01:23:56.080
[ Applause ]

01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:57.890
&gt;&gt; Lynnette Lewis Allston: Well,
I want to chime in on that,

01:23:57.890 --> 01:23:59.860
because in Native America,

01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:04.060
we deal with what we
call historical trauma.

01:24:04.060 --> 01:24:08.960
And it's the mindset, the things
that we have carried with us

01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:13.680
through the generations
that control how we interact

01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:19.610
with people, what we say,
what we are afraid to say.

01:24:19.610 --> 01:24:24.340
Because we feel we, we're
the lowest of the low.

01:24:24.340 --> 01:24:30.140
That was what 1619,
1607 began to do

01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:36.410
to our culture was make
us afraid of who we are.

01:24:36.410 --> 01:24:38.930
So that historical trauma
is still something we're

01:24:38.930 --> 01:24:40.230
dealing with.

01:24:40.230 --> 01:24:41.590
We are just beginning to talk

01:24:41.590 --> 01:24:45.360
about our history,
our perspective.

01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:49.230
And it is a revelation.

01:24:49.230 --> 01:24:57.790
It is an opportunity to release,
and we look forward to the 2019

01:24:57.790 --> 01:25:01.770
to let us have a voice
at the table to talk more

01:25:01.770 --> 01:25:04.440
about our perspective.

01:25:06.510 --> 01:25:11.600
[ Applause ]

01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:13.520
&gt;&gt; Cassandra Newby-Alexander:
So I will chime in as well.

01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:19.270
One of the things that I,
I'm going to compare this to,

01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:22.970
if you visit a plantation
anywhere in the South

01:25:22.970 --> 01:25:28.520
in America, you hear the
story of a handful of people

01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:33.140
who own the plantation,
their lives, their traumas,

01:25:33.140 --> 01:25:36.430
what they ate, what they
wore, whether they died,

01:25:36.430 --> 01:25:38.590
whether they had diseases.

01:25:38.590 --> 01:25:44.190
But you don't hear anything
about people who made sure

01:25:44.190 --> 01:25:50.550
that that plantation thrived,
survived, produced the goods.

01:25:50.550 --> 01:25:55.560
You don't hear about the trauma
that those individuals endured.

01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:58.780
You don't hear about
the work that went

01:25:58.780 --> 01:26:03.760
into creating this
plantation that thrived.

01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:07.260
You don't read about how
these were the individuals

01:26:07.260 --> 01:26:11.640
who actually built, or
constructed the buildings,

01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:17.280
planted the fields, maintained
the economic integrity

01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:19.890
of that particular plantation.

01:26:19.890 --> 01:26:23.770
For you, the visitor,
they are invisible.

01:26:23.770 --> 01:26:30.090
They are the side story that you
don't even really get to hear.

01:26:30.090 --> 01:26:35.350
And so going back
400 years is critical

01:26:35.350 --> 01:26:37.850
to the survival of our country.

01:26:37.850 --> 01:26:43.270
Because we have created such a
false narrative of who we are.

01:26:43.270 --> 01:26:46.940
We've created, sustained
and held

01:26:46.940 --> 01:26:53.530
on with both hands
this lie about America.

01:26:53.530 --> 01:26:57.700
This lie about how the
English arrived and bam,

01:26:57.700 --> 01:27:03.170
there was this gorgeous
creative, incredible nation

01:27:03.170 --> 01:27:06.270
that sprang out of nothing.

01:27:06.270 --> 01:27:09.980
With no one else's help
but the handful of English

01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:13.730
who first arrived and
their descendants.

01:27:13.730 --> 01:27:15.730
That's the narrative
that you hear.

01:27:15.730 --> 01:27:17.690
But that is a lie.

01:27:17.690 --> 01:27:23.580
And so it is critical that we
go back and not only deconstruct

01:27:23.580 --> 01:27:29.190
that lie but tell you why the
truth is far more important

01:27:29.190 --> 01:27:34.880
and far more of a guide to
who we can be for the future.

01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:41.270
And so, you know, in history,
sometimes it takes distance

01:27:41.270 --> 01:27:45.340
from a certain event
for us to really begin

01:27:45.340 --> 01:27:48.760
to want to face our pain.

01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:51.720
And today, in today's
society, you have a number

01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:53.890
of psychologists
and sociologists

01:27:53.890 --> 01:27:59.450
who are now studying this
posttraumatic stress disorder

01:27:59.450 --> 01:28:01.530
that many people of African

01:28:01.530 --> 01:28:04.740
and Native descent
have been experiencing

01:28:04.740 --> 01:28:10.010
for the past 400 plus
years in this society.

01:28:10.010 --> 01:28:11.930
Many people talk about, well,

01:28:11.930 --> 01:28:14.250
why aren't African-Americans
thriving

01:28:14.250 --> 01:28:17.430
like all these other immigrants
coming to this country?

01:28:17.430 --> 01:28:19.830
Well, none of the other
immigrants have to go

01:28:19.830 --> 01:28:24.220
through an ongoing process that
African-Americans went through.

01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:28.400
So it comforts us
to blame the victim

01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:30.270
for their own victimization

01:28:30.270 --> 01:28:34.120
and to ignore the
realities of our society.

01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:37.980
We talk about the
poverty and the alcoholism

01:28:37.980 --> 01:28:41.620
of the Native peoples, but we
don't talk about how we put many

01:28:41.620 --> 01:28:46.430
of them on land that not even
a tumbleweed survives on.

01:28:46.430 --> 01:28:49.760
And so we, this is the time.

01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:56.090
This is the time when America
can look back and begin

01:28:56.090 --> 01:29:01.510
to reconcile itself
with its own truth.

01:29:01.510 --> 01:29:08.340
[ Applause ]

01:29:08.340 --> 01:29:10.360
&gt;&gt; Joanne M. Braxton: A couple
more questions before we open it

01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:12.090
up to everyone.

01:29:12.090 --> 01:29:16.270
Chief Allston, you used a
term that may be unfamiliar

01:29:16.270 --> 01:29:20.250
to many folk, and that
term is paper genocide.

01:29:20.250 --> 01:29:24.510
Would you please explain
what paper genocide means?

01:29:24.510 --> 01:29:29.680
&gt;&gt; Lynette Lewis Allston: Well,
over time, identity is lost.

01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:34.950
Within our tribe, we find people
on census records and early

01:29:34.950 --> 01:29:38.450
on listed IND, Indian.

01:29:38.450 --> 01:29:45.330
But over time, that IND
changed to mulatto, MU.

01:29:45.330 --> 01:29:48.350
Or in some instances,
it was changed to white.

01:29:48.350 --> 01:29:52.730
And in other instances,
it was changed to black.

01:29:52.730 --> 01:29:58.350
And then we go to the
point that it's either a W

01:29:58.350 --> 01:30:04.020
or a C. You've effectively
erased an entire culture just

01:30:04.020 --> 01:30:08.800
by changing the markings
on a piece of paper.

01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:13.120
The census takers who came to
visit would look at someone

01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:16.500
and just say oh, I think this
is what this person looks like,

01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:19.080
and that's what I'm
going to call them.

01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:23.100
And so, identity was lost.

01:30:23.100 --> 01:30:28.730
I referred to the 1924
Racial Integrity Act,

01:30:28.730 --> 01:30:35.370
which was the final blow
on negative culture.

01:30:35.370 --> 01:30:36.890
Interesting enough,
there's something

01:30:36.890 --> 01:30:41.000
in there called the Pocahontas
exception, which if you happen

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:45.810
to be a certain percentage
of Indian,

01:30:45.810 --> 01:30:51.200
you could still claim
your European heritage.

01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:57.050
But it was because you
connected back to Pocahontas.

01:30:57.050 --> 01:31:01.600
So that's also part of
this identity issue.

01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:06.130
But that is also something that
affects our Native population

01:31:06.130 --> 01:31:10.280
because we are afraid to
admit we have some segments

01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:15.930
of our native community, are
afraid to admit that we are made

01:31:15.930 --> 01:31:21.670
up of multiple ethnic
or racial background.

01:31:21.670 --> 01:31:26.900
And paper genocide led us down
that road, and we are happy now

01:31:26.900 --> 01:31:31.020
that we're able to
reverse that cycle.

01:31:31.020 --> 01:31:35.410
&gt;&gt; Joanne M. Braxton: Thank you.

01:31:35.410 --> 01:31:40.640
Well, we're just
getting started here.

01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:46.190
And each of us here on
this stage is involved

01:31:46.190 --> 01:31:50.530
in some continuing
project or projects

01:31:50.530 --> 01:31:57.830
that will serve the
commemoration of 1619.

01:31:57.830 --> 01:32:01.150
We'll give you a few examples.

01:32:01.150 --> 01:32:07.780
The Middle Passage Project is
compiling a digital database

01:32:07.780 --> 01:32:10.060
and interactive map

01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:12.490
and exhibition charting
the movements

01:32:12.490 --> 01:32:19.520
and religious practices of
Weyanoke people, Native American

01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:21.310
and other Native Americans,

01:32:21.310 --> 01:32:26.970
as well as African
people in Virginia.

01:32:26.970 --> 01:32:32.650
And this will include
the collection

01:32:32.650 --> 01:32:42.080
of plant-based healing
practices, medicinal uses

01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:48.160
of herbs and so forth.

01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:54.050
This database will
expand opportunities

01:32:54.050 --> 01:32:56.590
for collaborative
research by new

01:32:56.590 --> 01:32:59.750
and emerging scholars
in the field.

01:32:59.750 --> 01:33:02.750
So that's something
that's already underway

01:33:02.750 --> 01:33:05.550
at William &amp; Mary.

01:33:05.550 --> 01:33:08.910
Trent, what else is
happening at William &amp; Mary?

01:33:08.910 --> 01:33:13.260
&gt;&gt; Robert Trent Vinson: Well at
William &amp; Mary, November 2019,

01:33:13.260 --> 01:33:16.850
the exact date is November 5th
through the 10th, November 5th

01:33:16.850 --> 01:33:21.670
through the 10th, 2019, is
we're hosting a major conference

01:33:21.670 --> 01:33:25.120
dealing with the implications
of 1619 going forward.

01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:29.420
It is bringing together a group
of scholars and lay people.

01:33:29.420 --> 01:33:32.050
The organization is called
the Association for the Study

01:33:32.050 --> 01:33:34.470
of the Worldwide
African Diaspora.

01:33:34.470 --> 01:33:36.580
Shorten that to ASWAD.

01:33:36.580 --> 01:33:39.680
It's the major professional
organization for those

01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:42.380
who study Africa and
the African diaspora.

01:33:42.380 --> 01:33:45.190
We're all coming from all
over the world descending

01:33:45.190 --> 01:33:49.920
on Williamsburg to William &amp;
Mary to engage in reflections

01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:56.200
on 1619 from Jamestown, but
also in the wider black world.

01:33:56.200 --> 01:33:58.430
So that, mark your
calendars, November 5th

01:33:58.430 --> 01:34:01.370
through the 10th, 2019.

01:34:01.370 --> 01:34:03.690
&gt;&gt; Joanne M. Braxton: And we're
anticipating about 900 scholars.

01:34:03.690 --> 01:34:04.990
Is that right?

01:34:04.990 --> 01:34:06.470
&gt;&gt; Robert Trent Vinson:
About 900 scholars,

01:34:06.470 --> 01:34:09.580
perhaps even 1,000
if you all show up.

01:34:10.850 --> 01:34:12.150
&gt;&gt; Joanne M. Braxton: Cassandra,

01:34:12.150 --> 01:34:13.450
what's happening
at Norfolk State?

01:34:13.450 --> 01:34:14.750
&gt;&gt; Cassandra Newby-Alexander:

01:34:14.750 --> 01:34:16.440
Norfolk State University
is going

01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:19.100
to continue its 1619 Making

01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:22.800
of America series
by having a summit.

01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:27.340
This would be an
international opportunity for us

01:34:27.340 --> 01:34:32.580
to livestream a conference,
a series of discussions,

01:34:32.580 --> 01:34:34.860
by scholars throughout
the country

01:34:34.860 --> 01:34:36.520
and throughout the world,

01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:41.530
talking about exactly what we
talked about today, which is,

01:34:41.530 --> 01:34:45.420
what happened beginning
in 1619, and how are we

01:34:45.420 --> 01:34:51.830
where we are today if we trace
it back to that magical moment,

01:34:51.830 --> 01:34:53.550
that important moment.

01:34:53.550 --> 01:34:56.740
And by magical I don't mean
oh, this is just glorious.

01:34:56.740 --> 01:35:03.530
But this magical important
moment in our history

01:35:03.530 --> 01:35:08.440
where things changed, and
they changed much more rapidly

01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:12.020
than we could ever
imagine today.

01:35:12.020 --> 01:35:14.720
So, Norfolk State University
is going to be the host

01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:18.460
to the 1619 Making
of America summit.

01:35:18.460 --> 01:35:22.540
It is, we are doing
this in collaboration

01:35:22.540 --> 01:35:27.570
with the 2019 Commemoration
Commission from Virginia,

01:35:27.570 --> 01:35:33.300
American evolution, to really
help our nation to begin

01:35:33.300 --> 01:35:34.700
to confront these issues.

01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:38.590
We will have nationally-known
scholars, speakers

01:35:38.590 --> 01:35:40.420
and others who will participate.

01:35:40.420 --> 01:35:42.830
We will also have
breakout sessions

01:35:42.830 --> 01:35:45.920
where we will livestream
this and connect

01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:47.870
with not only other scholars

01:35:47.870 --> 01:35:50.350
but with young people
throughout the country.

01:35:50.350 --> 01:35:54.810
And so this will be
September 26th and 27th,

01:35:54.810 --> 01:35:58.350
and on the 28th we will
have an actual tour

01:35:58.350 --> 01:36:01.150
to take people to
these early sites.

01:36:01.150 --> 01:36:05.950
So I hope you'll mark your
calendar and stay in our area

01:36:05.950 --> 01:36:09.430
from September all the
way through November.

01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:10.730
&gt;&gt; Robert Trent Vinson:
Hang out.

01:36:10.730 --> 01:36:12.030
&gt;&gt; Cassandra Newby-Alexander:
To participate in all

01:36:12.030 --> 01:36:13.520
of these wonderful events.

01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:18.630
And also to help us this year
September 14th and 15th as well

01:36:18.630 --> 01:36:23.770
as September 16th, we're
having a graphic novel contest

01:36:23.770 --> 01:36:26.550
and competition also in concert

01:36:26.550 --> 01:36:29.360
with the 2019 commemoration
commission.

01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:33.270
Why? Because we want young
people who are interested,

01:36:33.270 --> 01:36:38.510
who will read a graphic
novel to actually begin

01:36:38.510 --> 01:36:44.900
to hear this story about
what actually began in 1619.

01:36:44.900 --> 01:36:50.290
And it will be a contest in
which not only graphic artists

01:36:50.290 --> 01:36:53.780
and novelists and illustrators
will be judging this contest,

01:36:53.780 --> 01:36:57.140
but we would have
historians there looking

01:36:57.140 --> 01:37:02.380
over the narratives to ensure
that this is accurate history.

01:37:02.380 --> 01:37:06.890
That their storylines will
follow the correct line

01:37:06.890 --> 01:37:09.650
so that we can get this story

01:37:09.650 --> 01:37:14.760
out to the nation
and to the world.

01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:17.680
&gt;&gt; Joanne M. Braxton: So,
it may be at Norfolk State.

01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:23.050
It may be at William &amp; Mary,
but you can be sure that all

01:37:23.050 --> 01:37:26.140
of the folk on this
stage will be involved

01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:29.280
in supporting the events
you've just heard about

01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:31.910
and programs you've
just heard about.

01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:34.500
So we're going to take a few
questions from the audience.

01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:37.290
But then we're going to
come around at the end

01:37:37.290 --> 01:37:41.470
to answer one last question
panel members, and I want them

01:37:41.470 --> 01:37:42.770
to know what that question is

01:37:42.770 --> 01:37:44.980
in advance while they're
fielding other questions.

01:37:44.980 --> 01:37:49.300
And that is, what is the most
significant thing you would

01:37:49.300 --> 01:37:53.040
like for others to take
away from today's symposium.

01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:55.180
So we'll come back to that.

01:37:55.180 --> 01:37:57.480
Questions.

01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:01.460
Please.

01:38:01.460 --> 01:38:04.080
&gt;&gt; Hi. Hi everybody.

01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:05.650
Is this working?

01:38:05.650 --> 01:38:06.950
&gt;&gt; Joanne Braxton:
Give her a hand.

01:38:06.950 --> 01:38:08.250
Get that.

01:38:08.250 --> 01:38:09.550
&gt;&gt; It's working there?

01:38:09.550 --> 01:38:10.850
Okay, great.

01:38:10.850 --> 01:38:12.150
Hi, my name is Nichelle
Smith, and I'm with USA Today.

01:38:12.150 --> 01:38:14.920
I have a couple of questions
that might be really obvious

01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:17.830
to some here in terms of
History, but I'm beginning

01:38:17.830 --> 01:38:23.260
to see, as I'm reading
up on 2019 the use

01:38:23.260 --> 01:38:27.830
of the phrase enslaved
Africans rather than slaves.

01:38:27.830 --> 01:38:32.910
So I wanted you guys to explain
as I go forth for terminology

01:38:32.910 --> 01:38:36.770
in terms of how to cover it
why you're using that phrase.

01:38:36.770 --> 01:38:39.940
&gt;&gt; Joanne Braxton: This
folk were not born slaves.

01:38:39.940 --> 01:38:43.930
They had to be made into slaves.

01:38:43.930 --> 01:38:46.750
There are these places
along the coast,

01:38:46.750 --> 01:38:50.510
especially in West Africa, and
I've seen quite a few of them.

01:38:50.510 --> 01:38:53.640
And if you'd like to visit
them without going there,

01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:56.700
you can go to the Middle
Passage Project page

01:38:56.700 --> 01:38:59.540
on William &amp; Mary
dot edu website,

01:38:59.540 --> 01:39:05.400
and you can see Elmina
and Cape Coast.

01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:13.310
Some of these folks were marched
mercilessly from the interior.

01:39:13.310 --> 01:39:17.050
Maybe a third of the people
who started out on the journey

01:39:17.050 --> 01:39:20.150
to the sea didn't make it.

01:39:20.150 --> 01:39:23.200
Some would be yoked together.

01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:26.260
People would be yoked
in cockles.

01:39:26.260 --> 01:39:29.220
People whose health was not good

01:39:29.220 --> 01:39:34.320
or was failing might be
left in the bush to die.

01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:37.950
Small children might be
considered liabilities.

01:39:37.950 --> 01:39:42.950
They might be left
in the bush to die.

01:39:42.950 --> 01:39:46.850
But a day before, they may
simply have been taking a walk

01:39:46.850 --> 01:39:48.570
in the woods.

01:39:48.570 --> 01:39:50.140
You could have been
taking a walk

01:39:50.140 --> 01:39:54.800
in the woods somewhere near
what is present day Accra today

01:39:54.800 --> 01:40:01.150
with a loved one, and one of
you could be taken to Elmina.

01:40:01.150 --> 01:40:04.510
One of you could be
taken to Cape Coast.

01:40:04.510 --> 01:40:07.630
One of you would go to
a Portuguese territory.

01:40:07.630 --> 01:40:09.910
One of you would go to
an English territory.

01:40:09.910 --> 01:40:13.610
And you have a first cousin

01:40:13.610 --> 01:40:17.010
in Brazil while you're
in Jamestown.

01:40:17.010 --> 01:40:22.370
So, so many times the
faces seem similar.

01:40:22.370 --> 01:40:26.490
And when those people
left through those doors

01:40:26.490 --> 01:40:32.890
of no return, some of which
were about 15 inches wide,

01:40:32.890 --> 01:40:39.260
too narrow for you to go through
forward, just straight forward.

01:40:39.260 --> 01:40:42.240
They would have to march
side-by-side to be able

01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:43.680
to go through the door.

01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:48.000
And most frequently, they
were taken out at night

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:55.310
because when they
would see the coast

01:40:55.310 --> 01:41:01.730
of their nation falling away in
the distance in the daylight,

01:41:01.730 --> 01:41:04.120
some of them would
just stop breathing.

01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:09.570
And they refused to
be made into slaves.

01:41:09.570 --> 01:41:13.930
And if you would
go to Elmina, also,

01:41:13.930 --> 01:41:16.310
you would see there's a door.

01:41:16.310 --> 01:41:22.000
There are two doors actually.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:28.740
If you were to stand in the
Dutch reform chapel in Elmina,

01:41:28.740 --> 01:41:32.190
which is directly over
the women's dungeon,

01:41:32.190 --> 01:41:34.280
and you would look out,
you would see two doors.

01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:36.240
They were for punishment.

01:41:36.240 --> 01:41:38.170
One was for Europeans

01:41:38.170 --> 01:41:42.730
who infringed upon some
crime while they were there.

01:41:42.730 --> 01:41:44.770
And the others were for
Africans who refused

01:41:44.770 --> 01:41:47.150
to be made into slaves.

01:41:47.150 --> 01:41:50.660
Over that a door there is
a skull and crossbones.

01:41:50.660 --> 01:41:57.570
And they would put as many as
four or five people int hat room

01:41:57.570 --> 01:42:02.490
at a time, these Africans who
refused to be made into slaves.

01:42:02.490 --> 01:42:06.700
And no one came out of
that door until everyone

01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:09.470
in that room was dead.

01:42:09.470 --> 01:42:12.880
You don't have to
believe my story.

01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:14.940
You can check it out.

01:42:14.940 --> 01:42:19.180
It is so utterly
and shockingly true.

01:42:19.180 --> 01:42:24.050
And the photographs of those
locations are available

01:42:24.050 --> 01:42:26.350
to you for viewing.

01:42:31.380 --> 01:42:36.100
So, it's to acknowledge
the humanity of individuals

01:42:36.100 --> 01:42:42.830
as human beings, with,
we would presume,

01:42:42.830 --> 01:42:45.960
inalienably human rights.

01:42:57.740 --> 01:42:59.830
&gt;&gt; Hello. Thank you,
Dr. Braxton.

01:42:59.830 --> 01:43:01.960
It's been wonderful.

01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:07.060
I'm a student at Montgomery
College under Vincent Intondi,

01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:10.060
fantastic teacher of
African-American history.

01:43:10.060 --> 01:43:12.870
Also, I volunteer in the Young
Reader's Center downstairs.

01:43:12.870 --> 01:43:14.580
Yay. Yay, kids.

01:43:14.580 --> 01:43:19.850
I was very interested to
hear you reference Nell Irvin

01:43:19.850 --> 01:43:23.770
Painter's concept of Soul
Murder, and I hadn't heard

01:43:23.770 --> 01:43:26.690
of the other scholar who
you said had developed --

01:43:26.690 --> 01:43:28.170
&gt;&gt; Joanne M. Braxton:
Kelly Brown Douglas.

01:43:28.170 --> 01:43:29.470
&gt;&gt; Kelly?

01:43:29.470 --> 01:43:30.770
&gt;&gt; Joanne M. Braxton: Brown.

01:43:30.770 --> 01:43:32.070
&gt;&gt; Brown Douglas.

01:43:32.070 --> 01:43:33.370
&gt;&gt; Joanne M. Braxton: Douglas.

01:43:33.370 --> 01:43:37.130
&gt;&gt; And how is she
elaborated on the concept?

01:43:37.130 --> 01:43:39.320
&gt;&gt; Joanne M. Braxton:
She talks about it

01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:41.970
in the use of specific cases.

01:43:41.970 --> 01:43:50.570
I think she talks about people
who have been summarily murdered

01:43:50.570 --> 01:43:56.430
or executed without
due process of law.

01:43:56.430 --> 01:43:59.340
And she may have referred
specifically to the case

01:43:59.340 --> 01:44:02.800
of Eleanor Bumpurs
as an example.

01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:07.940
Eleanor Bumpurs, some of us will
recall, was an elderly woman

01:44:07.940 --> 01:44:13.740
in New York City who didn't
have, had fallen $50 short

01:44:13.740 --> 01:44:15.780
or something like
that on her rent.

01:44:15.780 --> 01:44:17.080
And the police came.

01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:19.250
There was a conflict,
and she ended up dead.

01:44:19.250 --> 01:44:22.540
And this has happened
too many times.

01:44:22.540 --> 01:44:23.930
So it's not just a question

01:44:23.930 --> 01:44:26.810
of what happens to
the person's body.

01:44:26.810 --> 01:44:31.420
It's a question of what
happens to their spirit.

01:44:31.420 --> 01:44:36.290
And we have to think really
about the young people

01:44:36.290 --> 01:44:41.980
who survive physically these
traumatic events but walk away

01:44:41.980 --> 01:44:47.340
with invisible wounds that
are not unlike the wounds

01:44:47.340 --> 01:44:51.960
that someone would
sustain on a battlefield.

01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:55.040
The walking wounded.

01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:57.330
Is that making sense?

01:44:57.330 --> 01:45:02.330
But you will be able
to find more precise

01:45:02.330 --> 01:45:06.530
and abundant references by
consulting her directly.

01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:13.680
And the other panelists are
available to field questions

01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:17.350
as well, so feel free to
direct questions toward them.

01:45:17.350 --> 01:45:19.630
&gt;&gt; Hi, my name is Jama Kelvey
[phonetic], and I wanted

01:45:19.630 --> 01:45:23.310
to just mention one thing
bout paper genocide.

01:45:23.310 --> 01:45:26.740
I'm quite worried about
it coming up in 2020.

01:45:26.740 --> 01:45:28.380
You referenced the census.

01:45:28.380 --> 01:45:33.540
And there's a real danger
for all of us to be succumbed

01:45:33.540 --> 01:45:37.620
or to have paper genocide
happen because the census is

01:45:37.620 --> 01:45:39.280
in real danger, as I
think you all know.

01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:40.580
So I wanted to mention that.

01:45:40.580 --> 01:45:43.160
Professor Vinson,
congratulations

01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:45.470
at William &amp; Mary has its
first woman president.

01:45:45.470 --> 01:45:46.770
&gt;&gt; Robert Trent Vinson: Yes.

01:45:46.770 --> 01:45:48.070
&gt;&gt; Yes indeed.

01:45:48.070 --> 01:45:49.500
[ Applause ]

01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:50.800
Yes indeed.

01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:52.100
Very happy, because she's coming

01:45:52.100 --> 01:45:53.400
from my alma mater,
Smith College.

01:45:53.400 --> 01:45:54.700
So I'm very happy about that.

01:45:54.700 --> 01:45:57.110
I wanted to address my
question to you though.

01:45:57.110 --> 01:46:00.050
I was really struck, this is
a statistic I had never heard

01:46:00.050 --> 01:46:05.620
before about the low percentage
of the African enslaved people

01:46:05.620 --> 01:46:08.200
who were taken to
Jamestown or North America

01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:09.500
as opposed to South America.

01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:11.740
And then you mention, of course,

01:46:11.740 --> 01:46:15.700
that this American South became
the largest slaveholding society

01:46:15.700 --> 01:46:17.000
in the world.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.270
Can you, this is a very, a
question that you could write

01:46:19.270 --> 01:46:23.430
and probably have written
thousands of books on, but why,

01:46:23.430 --> 01:46:27.170
what conditions made
North America the place

01:46:27.170 --> 01:46:29.210
for the largest slaveholding
society

01:46:29.210 --> 01:46:31.660
as opposed to South America?

01:46:31.660 --> 01:46:33.170
&gt;&gt; Robert Trent Vinson: Right.

01:46:33.170 --> 01:46:34.770
That's a big broad question

01:46:34.770 --> 01:46:38.470
that I can give you the short
answer is that slaveholders

01:46:38.470 --> 01:46:41.210
in South America,
Central America

01:46:41.210 --> 01:46:43.780
and the Caribbean
basically made a calculus

01:46:43.780 --> 01:46:45.200
that it was cheaper simply

01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:48.540
to keep importing
enslaved Africans.

01:46:48.540 --> 01:46:50.230
And so literally, you know,

01:46:50.230 --> 01:46:51.750
folk coming into the
Caribbean [inaudible]

01:46:51.750 --> 01:46:53.900
since the average lifespan
after arriving in the Caribbean,

01:46:53.900 --> 01:46:56.180
and these are people
in their prime,

01:46:56.180 --> 01:46:57.950
their high teens, early 20s.

01:46:57.950 --> 01:47:01.290
The average lifespan of
survival was seven years.

01:47:01.290 --> 01:47:05.320
And we're talking about
a population that's

01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:07.350
about two-thirds male.

01:47:07.350 --> 01:47:10.140
So those two dynamics are
simply, it's cheaper just

01:47:10.140 --> 01:47:11.920
to work them to death, work them
to death, work them to death,

01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:14.320
and we'll just import
more, right.

01:47:14.320 --> 01:47:17.030
And the gender imbalance meant
that there was a constant,

01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:20.020
constant influx of
more people coming in.

01:47:20.020 --> 01:47:22.810
So that was why the
numbers were so much higher.

01:47:22.810 --> 01:47:26.300
So that was the center of the
gravity for the slave trade.

01:47:26.300 --> 01:47:31.760
By contrast, North America was
really a type of backwater.

01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:36.100
And so the way that Angela
and her fellow captors made it

01:47:36.100 --> 01:47:39.120
to Jamestown was really an
accident of history, right.

01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:43.770
They were on their way to the
epicenter, in this case, Mexico.

01:47:43.770 --> 01:47:47.300
And because of those two ships,
they were rerouted, right.

01:47:47.300 --> 01:47:50.470
And so ultimately, and then
the United States banned the

01:47:50.470 --> 01:47:53.840
importation of enslaved
people in 1807,

01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:55.800
even though there was some
illegal activity going

01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:58.950
on as late as 1859,
short footnote.

01:47:58.950 --> 01:48:04.610
But the dynamic there was
natural reproduction became the

01:48:04.610 --> 01:48:06.220
preferred method if
you would, right.

01:48:06.220 --> 01:48:09.970
And so in that time, we
have tremendous growth.

01:48:09.970 --> 01:48:12.170
Right. In this way
too, we have to look

01:48:12.170 --> 01:48:16.550
at the Louisiana Purchase as
an important event as well.

01:48:16.550 --> 01:48:19.890
That doesn't happen without
the Haitian Revolution, right.

01:48:19.890 --> 01:48:21.490
That's the first thing to say.

01:48:21.490 --> 01:48:24.160
When Napoleon loses
Santa Mon [phonetic],

01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:26.770
the largest slave-producing
island for them.

01:48:26.770 --> 01:48:28.350
That becomes Haiti.

01:48:28.350 --> 01:48:32.760
Essentially, he has less of a
need for French North America.

01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:35.100
And he's trying to
finance his wars in Europe.

01:48:35.100 --> 01:48:41.590
And so he sells what becomes
the Midwest United States

01:48:41.590 --> 01:48:44.100
from Louisiana to
Canada for $15 million

01:48:44.100 --> 01:48:45.550
in the Louisiana Purchase.

01:48:45.550 --> 01:48:48.950
So Jefferson declares this as
an empire for liberty, right,

01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:50.850
double the size of
the United States.

01:48:50.850 --> 01:48:53.010
It really becomes an
empire for slavery

01:48:53.010 --> 01:48:55.160
because there's a second
middle passage that happens

01:48:55.160 --> 01:48:58.430
where a million people and
slave people move from states

01:48:58.430 --> 01:49:02.810
like Virginia to places like
Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama.

01:49:02.810 --> 01:49:04.110
So doubling the size

01:49:04.110 --> 01:49:06.450
of the United States also
doubled the size of slavery.

01:49:06.450 --> 01:49:09.700
And so we had more
territory now, right.

01:49:09.700 --> 01:49:13.130
So that is why we get the US
South becoming the large slave

01:49:13.130 --> 01:49:14.430
society in world history.

01:49:14.430 --> 01:49:16.730
Okay? You're welcome.

01:49:22.290 --> 01:49:23.920
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:29.680
Hello. I'm very interested in
what you all have had to say

01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:35.000
about collective trauma
in history and the need

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:36.590
to dispel false narratives.

01:49:36.590 --> 01:49:38.770
And I was wondering what
any of you might have to say

01:49:38.770 --> 01:49:42.040
about the possibility of
reparations playing a role

01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:45.060
in that, not just
for African-Americans

01:49:45.060 --> 01:49:48.610
but also potentially Native
Americans with removal

01:49:48.610 --> 01:49:51.060
and if you feel that
could play a role,

01:49:51.060 --> 01:49:54.480
how such a conversation
could even be begun.

01:49:54.480 --> 01:50:01.860
&gt;&gt; Cassandra Newby-Alexander:
I'll take a stab at that one.

01:50:01.860 --> 01:50:04.870
What is interesting to me is
whenever you hear the term

01:50:04.870 --> 01:50:09.960
reparations, reparations
for formerly enslaved people

01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:13.030
and their descendants,
the nation seems

01:50:13.030 --> 01:50:19.400
to collectively just go
into trauma themselves.

01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:24.690
America has a real problem
with acknowledging its role,

01:50:24.690 --> 01:50:31.110
its guilt in sustaining even
our Constitution, sustaining

01:50:31.110 --> 01:50:34.130
and perpetuating and
protecting slavery.

01:50:34.130 --> 01:50:35.880
Most people are not taught

01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:40.290
that the original
Constitution protected one piece

01:50:40.290 --> 01:50:43.220
of property, enslaved people.

01:50:43.220 --> 01:50:49.240
For the rights of those
who were the slaveholders.

01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:53.910
Because the Fugitive Slave Act,
the three-fifths compromise,

01:50:53.910 --> 01:50:55.310
all of these things that were

01:50:55.310 --> 01:50:59.720
in the original Constitution
gave federal protection

01:50:59.720 --> 01:51:01.400
to slavery.

01:51:01.400 --> 01:51:06.670
And Virginia, of course,
was the largest state

01:51:06.670 --> 01:51:10.290
that had the largest
population of enslave people.

01:51:10.290 --> 01:51:12.020
In fact, for a long time,

01:51:12.020 --> 01:51:14.360
Virginia had the
largest population.

01:51:14.360 --> 01:51:19.600
That's kind of a duh, right,
because it was the first colony.

01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:22.790
And all these people
that Dr. Vinson talked

01:51:22.790 --> 01:51:27.520
about being transported to the
lower South, most of them were

01:51:27.520 --> 01:51:30.760
from Virginia, and
yet, as thousands

01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:34.310
of people were transported
beginning in the early 1900s

01:51:34.310 --> 01:51:37.950
to the lower South, the
population in Virginia

01:51:37.950 --> 01:51:39.350
of Africans

01:51:39.350 --> 01:51:42.260
and African-Americans
sustained itself.

01:51:42.260 --> 01:51:45.230
The reproduction was high
because of the kinds of crops

01:51:45.230 --> 01:51:47.880
that were being produced,
the kinds of industries,

01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:53.330
so much so that the
primary industry in Virginia

01:51:53.330 --> 01:51:58.350
by the 1820s and 30s was
the domestic slave trade.

01:51:58.350 --> 01:52:02.200
That is what Virginia made
most of this money from.

01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:08.570
And so everything went into
creating more enslaved people

01:52:08.570 --> 01:52:12.020
and making sure that
they survived to be part

01:52:12.020 --> 01:52:14.970
of this domestic slave trade.

01:52:14.970 --> 01:52:17.410
And so when we talk
about reparations,

01:52:17.410 --> 01:52:21.630
a lot of people focus in on
what happened to enslaved people

01:52:21.630 --> 01:52:24.340
and how their labor was
used for a long time.

01:52:24.340 --> 01:52:29.980
But I actually argue that
reparations really should be

01:52:29.980 --> 01:52:34.080
after 1865, after
the 13th Amendment,

01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:40.170
after the 14th Amendment when
African-Americans whose rights

01:52:40.170 --> 01:52:43.630
as human beings was now
federally recognized

01:52:43.630 --> 01:52:46.940
that the states and
federal government continued

01:52:46.940 --> 01:52:52.250
to deprive them of their
property, of their civil rights.

01:52:52.250 --> 01:52:54.990
They began to redline them.

01:52:54.990 --> 01:52:59.410
They began to make them pay
more money than white Americans

01:52:59.410 --> 01:53:02.170
for their property,
for their schools,

01:53:02.170 --> 01:53:06.050
even though their schools were
supposed to be equally funded,

01:53:06.050 --> 01:53:08.290
or at least funded
by property taxes.

01:53:08.290 --> 01:53:09.590
They weren't.

01:53:09.590 --> 01:53:13.180
In the 1940s, the
Journal and Guide,

01:53:13.180 --> 01:53:16.420
which was a black-owned
newspaper operating

01:53:16.420 --> 01:53:20.760
out of Norfolk, Virginia,
published an expose showing

01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:25.220
that Virginia systematically
took between 2

01:53:25.220 --> 01:53:31.490
and $30,000 a year from all
of the counties and cities

01:53:31.490 --> 01:53:34.050
in which African-Americans
were located.

01:53:34.050 --> 01:53:37.980
This is money that
African-Americans were paying

01:53:37.980 --> 01:53:42.130
in taxes to go to their schools,
and they were redirecting

01:53:42.130 --> 01:53:45.610
that money to the white schools.

01:53:45.610 --> 01:53:51.690
So we're not even talking about
paying somebody for labor.

01:53:51.690 --> 01:53:56.370
We're talking about real
dollars that were supposed to go

01:53:56.370 --> 01:53:59.780
to one thing, and they
were put to something else.

01:53:59.780 --> 01:54:02.990
So reparations is
an important way

01:54:02.990 --> 01:54:09.100
to start reinfusing our
communities and our society

01:54:09.100 --> 01:54:11.840
with money that should be there,

01:54:11.840 --> 01:54:13.830
should have been there
from the beginning.

01:54:13.830 --> 01:54:17.800
I'm at Norfolk State University,
a historically black college,

01:54:17.800 --> 01:54:20.820
or what they call black
college and university.

01:54:20.820 --> 01:54:25.190
And Norfolk State University
was underfunded according

01:54:25.190 --> 01:54:31.900
to the Virginia governmental
formula for 75 years.

01:54:31.900 --> 01:54:33.590
For 75 years.

01:54:33.590 --> 01:54:38.210
And Virginia settled that
underfunding for $10 million,

01:54:38.210 --> 01:54:41.480
for 75 years of underfunding.

01:54:41.480 --> 01:54:44.130
What can you do with
$10 million?

01:54:44.130 --> 01:54:48.750
And I'm not talking about
$10 million in 1870 money.

01:54:48.750 --> 01:54:52.730
I'm talking about $10
million in the latter part

01:54:52.730 --> 01:54:54.300
of the 20th century dollars.

01:54:54.300 --> 01:54:58.970
You can't even construct part
of a building with $10 million.

01:54:58.970 --> 01:55:04.490
So reparations to me has been
seen when it comes to people

01:55:04.490 --> 01:55:06.650
of color as a giveaway.

01:55:06.650 --> 01:55:08.380
That everybody would get a dime.

01:55:08.380 --> 01:55:11.630
But that is not what
reparations is all about.

01:55:11.630 --> 01:55:15.240
It is restoring what was taken,

01:55:15.240 --> 01:55:20.480
what was forcefully
illegally taken.

01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:24.530
And how you restore is really,

01:55:24.530 --> 01:55:27.530
really should be the
discussion line, not whether

01:55:27.530 --> 01:55:30.490
or not it should be
restored but how.

01:55:30.490 --> 01:55:35.360
And the way in which it can be
restored can help really enhance

01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:38.510
our nation.

01:55:38.510 --> 01:55:44.040

01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:45.340
&gt;&gt; Joanne M. Braxton: So,

01:55:45.340 --> 01:55:50.310
I've been given the high
sign by those above me.

01:55:50.310 --> 01:55:55.510
And I'd like to close

01:55:55.510 --> 01:55:59.930
by reflecting myself
on the question.

01:55:59.930 --> 01:56:02.940
What is the most significant
thing you would like others

01:56:02.940 --> 01:56:06.250
to take away from
today's symposium.

01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:20.430
I would like you to reflect on
today's panel and the questions

01:56:20.430 --> 01:56:27.190
that have just started
to surface as an opening

01:56:27.190 --> 01:56:32.510
of moral space for
a conversation

01:56:32.510 --> 01:56:36.870
about many kinds of repair.

01:56:36.870 --> 01:56:49.870
Soul repair, material
reparations, and just a thought

01:56:49.870 --> 01:56:54.990
about what it means
to be an American

01:56:54.990 --> 01:57:01.800
and how we became Americans.

01:57:01.800 --> 01:57:10.740
So this space is open now,
and we're going to do our best

01:57:10.740 --> 01:57:15.490
to hold it open through 2019.

01:57:15.490 --> 01:57:17.770
Please join us.

01:57:17.770 --> 01:57:19.570

the Kluge Center and the Library

01:57:33.820 --> 01:57:36.840
of Congress, I'd like to
thank all of our participants,

01:57:36.840 --> 01:57:41.930
all of you for coming and, you
know, especially Dr. Braxton.

01:57:41.930 --> 01:57:45.910
She's been a pleasure to have
with the center, and we're going

01:57:45.910 --> 01:57:48.160
to be sad to see her go.

01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:50.510
So once again, thank you.

01:57:57.270 --> 01:58:02.570
So, now we have both a reception
for you all and then a display

01:58:02.570 --> 01:58:05.940
of items from the Library
of Congress' collections.

01:58:05.940 --> 01:58:09.220
You cannot take any food
or drink into the display.

01:58:09.220 --> 01:58:10.640
My interns are well-trained.

like to thank you all

01:58:13.790 --> 01:58:16.410
