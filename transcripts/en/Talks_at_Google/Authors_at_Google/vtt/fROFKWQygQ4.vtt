&gt;&gt;Nick: Welcome everyone, to another Authors@Google
program at the San Francisco office.

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:08.110
Thanks so much for joining us.

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:10.639
We're very happy to have Dana Priest here.

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:13.940
She's an investigative reporter with the Washington
Post, but she's originally from California,

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:14.940
so welcome home.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.070
&gt;&gt;Dana Priest: Thank you.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.949
&gt;&gt;Nick: She's covered the intelligence, pentagon,
and health care areas for the Washington Post

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:25.810
and has won numerous awards including the
2008 Pulitzer Prize for her work on The Other

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.519
Walter Reed and the 2006 Pulitzer Prize for
beat reporting for her work on the CIA's secret

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:34.260
prisons and counter-terrorism operations overseas.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.079
She's the author of the 2003 book, The Mission,
Waging War and Keeping Peace with America's

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.070
Military, and today she'll be discussing her
latest book, Top Secret America, The Rise

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.010
of the New American Security State.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.890
Please welcome Dana Priest.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:49.890
[applause]

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.240
&gt;&gt;Dana Priest: Thank you.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.240
Ok.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.240
Well thank you.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.240
It's good to be home.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.410
I'm trying to do this and one of my goals
this year was to figure out how to actually

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.310
use the iPad, so, I'm gonna give it a try.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:09.500
I wanted to tell you a story about how, partly
how this book started.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.890
And since you all, I know you all, everybody
warned me that you were gonna be on your computers

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.950
during this talk and I wasn't supposed to
be offended by it.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.321
But I would like to give you a suggestion
about what you should be doing on your computer

00:01:19.321 --> 00:01:25.460
while I'm talking to you, so if you go to
washingtonpost.com/topsecretamerica, you'll

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.120
see the website that initiated that is the,
the back that initiated the book.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.270
It's a series that we did for the Post and
there's some great graphics, interactive graphics

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.549
that you can use, so once I explain what in
the heck we're doing and you wanna put your

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:48.909
ZIP code in or whatever, you can look around
there and play with it and hopefully not,

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.100
don't get too distracted.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.229
While I was doing the work on the series,
I was in the Boise, Idaho, airport one day,

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:05.119
coming back from the Idaho Intelligence Fusion
Center, which is a place where the Department

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:11.030
of Homeland Security has funded intelligence
fusion centers in all the states and sometimes

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:19.030
more than one in each state, to begin putting
together the intelligence on counter-terrorism

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.010
or on terrorists.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.231
And a lot of the places like Idaho don't really
have a lot of business in terrorism, so they

00:02:25.231 --> 00:02:28.980
have turned it into looking for other kind
of crimes.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.460
But anyway, I was in the airport and I saw
this elderly woman over near the security

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.460
scanner.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.440
She was in a wheelchair and she was struggling
to get herself up out of the wheelchair and

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.870
gripping the sides of the scanner to go through
you know the security clearance thing, and

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.980
one of the guards, the TSA guards, was painfully
looking at her and you know said, "Oh, are

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:53.980
you ok?

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:54.980
Are you in pain?"

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.840
And she said, "No, I'm ok, I'm ok."

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.790
So I said I'll, I took my notebook out and
I went over there, I was already in my mindset

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.280
was, you know, this world had gotten so big
and it's so imprecise still and what keeps

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.030
us safer and what doesn't keep us safer?

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.630
And it sort of struck me as ludicrous that
this turns out to be 78-year-old grandmother

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.440
from Boise, Idaho, would have to get herself
out of her wheelchair and go through the security

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.420
scanner in order to make us safer.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.300
So I went over to her and asked her, you know,
"What do you think about this hassle?"

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.620
And she said, "Oh, I don't mind it at all.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.450
You know I could be a terrorist.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.630
I could have explosives."

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.870
She, you know, wearing her bright white new
tennies and her flowered jacket, you know,

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:42.870
she was very happy.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.460
But then all of a sudden she got really serious
and she said, "You know last time I went through

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.300
here they didn't even check."

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.170
And she opened her jacket and she said, "I
could've had a bomb."

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.170
[laughter]

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.060
&gt;&gt;Dana Priest: I'm thinking, well, maybe.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:03.400
But the fact is no, you know no terrorist
has been found out through these sorts of

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.390
security scanners and no terrorist has ever
fit the profile of Joy Whiteman, her name

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.400
was, 78-year-old Joy Whiteman.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:20.190
So is that a real good, good use of our money,
or what this became to me was a kind of perfect

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:26.590
metaphor for how to begin the book and how
to begin a process of questioning what is

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.510
it that we've done with, in the post-9/11
world, with all the money and with our own

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.220
fear about terrorism, what is it that we created?

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:43.510
And Joy Whiteman, in her struggle to get through
sort of exemplified that for me.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:50.630
So what we did in order to answer some of
those questions is that my co-author and I,

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.410
Bill Arkin, [laughs] who would be just died
and gone to heaven to be here because he's,

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.220
he's one of you people.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.400
[laughing] He and I separately had begun to
look at this world.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.540
I began to look because I was covering the
intelligence community and I'd written about

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:12.410
the CIA's black sites, its covert operations
and how it was disappearing people after 9/11

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.930
in order to interrogate them.

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.150
And I had seen and met a lot of people from
organizations that were entirely new that

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.830
I had never heard of before and separately
Bill, working out of his barn in Vermont,

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.760
had been seeing the growth in a different
way.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.060
He's a, he's a documents guy.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:36.870
So he was collecting government contracts
for the intelligence world that you could

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.050
see, 'cause lots of it's classified.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:46.430
And, and making lists and creating his own
databases and cross-referencing things, so

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:53.050
he was getting contracts, but he was also
getting more obscure contracts like the distribution

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.140
of electricity.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:58.830
He got contracts for companies that would,
that would keep track of that for different

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:03.570
government agencies, so that if he saw something
on Google Maps, if he got pointed in that

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:08.030
direction through other research and he saw
something that he got, had a suspicion about

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.360
what it was, he would get the electricity
distribution of that county and he would find

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.990
that, oh, my God, there's like a huge amount
of energy being used at this place and then

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:24.360
in one instance he actually discovered through
that that this was a National Security Agency

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:30.780
downlink for its, its surveillance overseas
and what have you.

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:37.310
And then he would go on those super-secret
websites like Monster.com

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:38.310
[laughter]

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:45.200
&gt;&gt;Dana Priest: and type in, and you can do
this too now, if you want to, type in top

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:54.540
secret in its search engine and up came at
that time thousands of job descriptions for

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.320
people with top secret security clearances.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:03.460
But not only that, it would have the job description
and it would have, depending on what company

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:07.520
it was, some hint of what they were doing.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:13.690
And then in many cases it had five or six
code names for programs that they wanted that

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.190
person to be familiar with.

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:19.630
It didn't say what the code names meant, but
it said that there were code names.

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:25.450
And he began then, of course, he's a self-described
obsessive-compulsive person.

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:28.169
Best kind you know to be a researcher.

00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:34.580
So he would make lists of the code names,
lists of the uses of electricity, lists of

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:42.320
contractors and contractees, and eventually
and he would begin to cross-reference all

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.710
of these and some of them began to make sense.

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:50.949
And then he would go to this other super-secret
website called LinkedIn, not quite a website,

00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:56.070
but network, and find that there were people
who had security clearances who were not supposed

00:07:56.070 --> 00:08:02.190
to be telling anybody what they did but they
were on LinkedIn and their biographies not

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:08.270
only told you what organizations they had
worked on but sometimes what code name programs

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:10.020
they were familiar with.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:16.520
So for us that was a confirmation of, of these
sorts of things and in some cases the LinkedIn

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:24.480
bios confirmed some of the more secret organizations
that we'd discovered, because you know we'd

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.410
think well it's actually called Tosa, well
I don't know is that a real name or could

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:29.990
it be Tose?

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:33.779
And we would search LinkedIn and there would
be some guy there who said he had at one time

00:08:33.779 --> 00:08:39.950
headed Tosa for such and such an agency.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:44.920
When we got together and we decided that we
wanted to try to get our arms around the world

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:51.540
that was created in the military and intelligence
worlds after 9/11 to respond to the terrorists'

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:57.120
attacks, one of the things that we wanted
to do was to be able to show it to people.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:03.740
And he was gonna be the one that quantified
it, or tried to, and I was gonna be the one

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:11.420
to get inside of it, talk to people inside,
put the, the flesh on the skeleton that we

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:14.240
were hoping to create with his data.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:19.120
And one of the things we both had experiences
with was locating things.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:23.860
I knew from my secret prisons experience that
everything, even if it's, if it's supposed

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:27.870
to be covert and never found, lives somewhere.

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:32.730
So we said well we should try to get addresses
and geo locate everything we find.

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:38.100
And it was painstaking, but we did that.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:43.870
And we created what we call an alternative
geography of the United States.

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:51.440
Once we could put all these dots on our map,
we created a map of the United States that

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.820
we used to do our further reporting.

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.420
A version of the map is on our website.

00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:01.500
And the version that's on the website excludes
a lot of information that we did, a lot of

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:07.650
detail that we learned, in part for security
reasons that we, that we thought about all

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:09.140
along the way.

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:13.890
So we want to tell people all we can about
this world, including making it real for them

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:18.020
so they don't have to rely on me, you know,
saying that it exists.

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:21.960
At the same time we want to be conscious of
some of the security implications.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:26.050
So we have a map that that shows you the alternative
geography.

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:31.240
We also thought about it kind of like a genome
project that we were creating the DNA, we

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:36.150
were mapping the DNA of this secret world,
which was a fun way to think about it.

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:41.270
And then once we had the map and the addresses,
I should say that some of the addresses came

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:48.930
about because he would give me addresses to
go visit, but I would also find some of my

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:55.000
own and give 'em back to him and as we went
back and forth we found that, for instance,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.560
if I went out to one place that he had given
me, then I would scope the whole area out

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:05.860
and end up giving him more addresses that
he would put back in his, in his database

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:08.360
and then go through his searches.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:14.790
Google was helpful when we had an address
already because actually that's a huge, that

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:17.440
was the way that it was hugely helpful.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:22.680
And also Google Maps was incredible because
we and we spent a lot of time on Google Maps

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:29.130
trying to, you know, once you could figure
out what the security looked like around a

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:33.180
place that was hiding in plain sight , you
could find all sorts of things that would

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:38.560
help you confirm whether you should keep going
or not or whether this was a total mislead.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:45.770
But I first started, so we had this map that
we, or the map was developing.

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:50.440
I went out, so one of the, one of the hard
parts was trying to get inside the world because

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.650
of course we don't have clearances and we,
which would be a silly thing, because I'm

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:58.910
a reporter, I do the opposite of trying to
hide information, I'm always trying to share

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:01.930
it, in a responsible way.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:08.020
So I convinced the Defense Intelligence Agency,
which is the largest of the intelligence agencies,

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:14.779
even though the CIA gets all the attention,
it's relatively small, to let me sit in on

00:12:14.779 --> 00:12:20.920
a class that they were teaching on how do
you keep a secret conference, a top-secret

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.580
conference, how do you keep that information
from leaking out?

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:29.529
'Cause I, one of the things I wanted to do
was to, to show how onerous keeping secrets

00:12:29.529 --> 00:12:31.910
is for the government.

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:34.670
So they let me come to the class, and it is
onerous.

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:39.050
I mean we did everything from, you know if
this were a secret meeting, figuring out you

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:43.770
know where to station the guards, how to take
your papers away from you, how to definitely

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:47.520
not let you bring any electronics into the
meeting.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:52.459
If you did have notes you wanted to keep,
how to send them to you a way, in a secure

00:12:52.459 --> 00:12:58.810
way through the, through snail mail, and they
use couriers to drop the things at the post

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:05.490
office, you know, it's just on and on to reverse
engineer that is an amazing thing, which,

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:06.490
which I did also.

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:10.790
But while we were there, I learned how to
set a zephyr lock, which is this electromagnetic

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:18.290
locks that are used to guard offices where
top secret information is going on.

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:22.730
I drove up to this place I'd never seen before
behind the Baltimore-Washington Airport, a

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:28.790
place that I have been many times, and I was
in this neighborhood that was really eerie.

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:35.770
It just had a, it wasn't, it wasn't, it was
subtly eerie, which is even more eerie in

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:36.770
a way.

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:42.070
[laughing] All the buildings look different,
you know, they, none of them had or few of

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:46.690
them had signs like where you were or what
company it represented.

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:52.650
Most of 'em had were of the same kind of architecture
and they had the same types of window film

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:58.490
on it and they had numbers on it instead of,
you know instead of the logos.

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:03.529
And so I started, I would keep my laptop in
the car with me and put it and open it up

00:14:03.529 --> 00:14:08.209
usually to Google Maps, so that when Bill
was giving me addresses, you know, I could

00:14:08.209 --> 00:14:12.480
find them on the map, but then here I am in
this place that looks so weird, and I'm driving

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:17.430
around and I'm giving him addresses and he's,
you know, he's looking at it from his barn

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:21.810
in Vermont on the maps and giving me, you
know, oh go here, go there.

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:28.100
And what it, what it turned out to be was
I was sitting in what we later identified

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:32.339
as or called the Capital of Top Secret America.

00:14:32.339 --> 00:14:39.080
Which is not in Washington D.C., it's actually
north of Washington in Fort Mead, which is

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:42.660
where the National Security Agency resides.

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:47.990
And the NSA is one of the largest intelligence
agencies.

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:55.100
It is involved in surveillance, electronic
surveillance of every kind, mostly overseas,

00:14:55.100 --> 00:15:02.300
but increasingly also in the United States
with the proper authorities.

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:08.830
And so this thing that I had stumbled upon
was the densest part of Top Secret America.

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:14.019
And it was not only these government buildings
that were there, but contractors that were

00:15:14.019 --> 00:15:15.019
there.

00:15:15.019 --> 00:15:21.279
And we learned later as we as this world woke
up to us as we could see what was all around

00:15:21.279 --> 00:15:28.330
us in a different way, that you had a clustering
effect throughout the country.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:34.570
And the clusters would be clustered around
a government, a big government agency, but

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:39.660
then sub-agencies would come and grow up near
the big agency, the ones that worked with

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:46.320
it and then companies would relocate and develop
around them too, because they were now the

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:52.480
growing contractor base, which we knew existed,
but we didn't know to what extent it existed

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:56.190
and that was also what we were trying to document.

00:15:56.190 --> 00:16:04.399
So for this cluster that we're talking about
here at the National Security Agency, it was

00:16:04.399 --> 00:16:11.149
so visible if you turned down the right streets
and I found the right streets because as I

00:16:11.149 --> 00:16:18.570
exited from the freeway to get into this location,
I was, you know my reporter's antenna was

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:25.269
really up, and, meaning I don't know what
I'm gonna find, I'm looking at everything

00:16:25.269 --> 00:16:31.510
trying to just you know have all my senses
aware and I see a lawn sign, you know the

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:36.900
kind of lawn signs that you see that says
Townhouses $400,000 and up?

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:47.930
Only this lawn sign said, Joe's Café, Job
Fair, Cleared Personnel, TS/SCI, which means

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:56.240
top secret/secure compartmented information,
which is above top secret.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:02.269
And so I went to Joe's Café and it was like
this divey café like you see all over the

00:17:02.269 --> 00:17:09.079
place, but instead of posters for you know
the newest kind of coffee or whatever, it

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:15.939
had information, it had Lockheed Martin and
General Dynamics and Khaki and SAIC posters

00:17:15.939 --> 00:17:26.819
for job positions and the little coffee holder
didn't have like Google on it, it had you

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:33.980
know it had Carahsoft, which is a company
that does top secret work in the IT space

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:36.740
for the government.

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:45.090
So when I got there I noticed that right across
the street there was a big business park.

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:50.080
And so I drove around the business park and
it was a business park, turns out, of the

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.539
biggest contractors in Top Secret America.

00:17:52.539 --> 00:17:56.630
I mean I didn't know that at the time, I was
just writing everything down.

00:17:56.630 --> 00:18:05.600
Huge, hundreds of acres of business, corporation
after corporation, giant gleaming new buildings,

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.799
and of course I copied down every logo I could
find.

00:18:08.799 --> 00:18:14.450
And unlike the places nearer to the nation's
capital where these companies operate where

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:18.960
they keep a rather low profile, they'll have
like the little logo on top as you're driving

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:23.359
down some of the main highways you'll see
them all over the place.

00:18:23.359 --> 00:18:29.690
Here, since nobody except the people inside
ever come there, you wouldn't know to come

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:35.009
there, it's kind of hidden behind trees, it
was like they were showing their flag and

00:18:35.009 --> 00:18:38.940
the logos were bigger and brighter and you
know they were saying here we are and they

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:47.309
even had a, a, a private bridge between the
business park and the National Security Agency

00:18:47.309 --> 00:18:52.059
which only they could use, so they could have
direct access.

00:18:52.059 --> 00:18:58.149
So when we began to think about contractors,
we, one of the things we did was we looked

00:18:58.149 --> 00:19:04.240
at every agency and figured out how many contractors
work for it at the top secret level and at

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:08.080
the NSA there were greater number than anywhere
else.

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.470
There was something over 400.

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:15.710
So I wanna stop for one second and show you,
can you still hear me?

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:18.480
[chuckles] Or maybe Nick will run it.

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:19.929
&gt;&gt;Nick: I can do it When you're ready, just
give me the thumbs up.

00:19:19.929 --> 00:19:25.030
&gt;&gt;Dana Priest: One of the things we wanted
to do before you turn that on is I wanted--.

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:28.870
As a journalist I was getting very frustrated
by the fact that I thought the platform was

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:35.279
driving the content, you know everyone was
so mesmerized and and baffled by the multi-platforms

00:19:35.279 --> 00:19:39.759
that you could present your material on and
we were far behind in trying to figure out

00:19:39.759 --> 00:19:45.720
how to use that, so I thought that the platforms
were really driving what a lot of journalists

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:51.160
did, which was making me really mad, because
I think that the content should drive, you

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.369
know the platforms should serve the content.

00:19:53.369 --> 00:20:00.960
And so I was, I was convinced that I could
use this project to show that the platforms

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:06.479
could deepen the reporting experience and
the information sharing.

00:20:06.479 --> 00:20:12.519
So we started from the very start this would
be a multi, a multi-media project and that's

00:20:12.519 --> 00:20:18.110
why we had the website, but we also did a
video that is supposed to make it simpler

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:26.759
to understand what you were gonna read and,
and here's the, here's the video.

00:20:26.759 --> 00:20:29.499
[music starts]

00:20:29.499 --> 00:20:38.519
&gt;&gt;video narrator: You think you know America,
but you don't know Top Secret America.

00:20:38.519 --> 00:20:46.350
We're all aware that there are three branches
of government in the United States, but in

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:50.070
response to 9/11, a fourth branch has emerged.

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:56.059
It is protected from public scrutiny by extraordinary
secrecy.

00:20:56.059 --> 00:20:57.059
Top Secret America.

00:20:57.059 --> 00:21:02.769
&gt;&gt;William M. Arkin, reporter: This is a closed
community and since 9/11 it's become even

00:21:02.769 --> 00:21:03.769
more so.

00:21:03.769 --> 00:21:09.639
&gt;&gt;Dana Priest: The money spigot was just opened
after 9/11 and nobody dared say, "I don't

00:21:09.639 --> 00:21:11.210
think we should be spending that much."

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:15.649
&gt;&gt;video narrator: It has become so big and
the lines of responsibility are so blurred

00:21:15.649 --> 00:21:18.690
that even our nation's leaders don't have
a handle on it.

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:20.429
Where is it?

00:21:20.429 --> 00:21:25.730
It's being built from coast to coast, hidden
within some of America's most familiar cities

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:34.059
and neighborhoods, in Colorado, in Nebraska,
in Texas, in Florida, in the suburbs of Washington

00:21:34.059 --> 00:21:35.809
D.C.

00:21:35.809 --> 00:21:41.669
Top Secret America includes hundreds of federal
departments and agencies operating out of

00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:43.889
1300 facilities around this country.

00:21:43.889 --> 00:21:48.159
They contract the services of nearly 2000
companies.

00:21:48.159 --> 00:21:54.519
In all, more people than live in our nation's
capital have top secret security clearance.

00:21:54.519 --> 00:22:01.460
&gt;&gt;Dana Priest: It's again the size, the, the
lack of transparency and the cost.

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:05.619
And if we don't get it right, the consequences
are gigantic.

00:22:05.619 --> 00:22:10.360
&gt;&gt;Dana Priest: Can you stay up there for a
minute and do the photos?

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:11.360
Ok.

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.360
[music ends]

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:13.360
&gt;&gt;Dana Priest: So I have some other audio
visuals.

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:17.760
This world began right after 9/11 when congress
and everyone else was panicked that there

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.799
was gonna be another attack.

00:22:19.799 --> 00:22:22.110
And what congress did was to write a blank
check.

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:25.669
It was actually $40 billion, but you know
what the heck?

00:22:25.669 --> 00:22:30.659
Close to a blank check because weeks later
they gave them another $40 billion, and the

00:22:30.659 --> 00:22:34.080
money spigot just continued in that vein.

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:37.710
And it was for anything you know that they
thought would help.

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:43.029
So all intelligence agencies and a lot of
the military and law enforcement agencies

00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:45.350
came up with all sorts of ideas.

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:51.389
And the problem, I think, is that nobody every
stopped and said, you know years later when

00:22:51.389 --> 00:22:57.609
they figured out that there weren't 100 Al-Qaeda
sleeper cells in the United States, nobody

00:22:57.609 --> 00:23:00.720
stopped to say, you know, let's reassess.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:03.740
What's working and what's not working?

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:09.200
So when it started to grow, they said, well
we better get a manager here to manage all

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.590
this growth.

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:16.690
So congress, and with the President's support,
passed legislation that created somebody,

00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:21.119
an office and a person that was supposed to
be the manager of the whole darn thing, which

00:23:21.119 --> 00:23:26.600
is called the National, the Director of National
Intelligence.

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:30.379
But because it was congress and none of the
committees wanted to give up any of their

00:23:30.379 --> 00:23:36.960
power over certain agencies, they didn't actually
give him the authority to do the job that

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.429
they said they wanted him to do.

00:23:38.429 --> 00:23:44.360
They, he couldn't even hire and fire, much
less tell some organization as big as the

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:48.950
Defense Department what it was and wasn't
gonna do and Donald Rumsfeld was the Defense

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:54.630
Secretary and he wasn't gonna let any other
government official take a large chunk of

00:23:54.630 --> 00:24:00.309
his power away either, so it became a feckless
organization from the beginning.

00:24:00.309 --> 00:24:05.009
It's gotten better in some regards, but not
in others, but one thing it has done is grown

00:24:05.009 --> 00:24:11.409
and so this is a building that you're not
supposed to see because it's a, an undeclared

00:24:11.409 --> 00:24:12.429
location.

00:24:12.429 --> 00:24:20.460
It's located in some of the toniest real estate
market in the Washington area, Fairfax County.

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:24.619
The photographer that took this picture, this
is in the winter, so as you can see the trees

00:24:24.619 --> 00:24:29.489
don't have leaves on 'em, and he found a,
after I scouted it out, I mean I knew where

00:24:29.489 --> 00:24:30.759
it was 'cause I'd been there.

00:24:30.759 --> 00:24:37.940
But you know I scouted out a place that he
could take pictures from that was on public

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:38.940
property.

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:44.001
And even though he was on public property,
he tells the story about going and doing it

00:24:44.001 --> 00:24:49.519
and having people seemingly drop out of the
trees with black, you know, uniforms on and

00:24:49.519 --> 00:24:50.779
big guns and [laughing].

00:24:50.779 --> 00:24:56.230
They didn't confiscate his camera, but they
almost did, and they didn't, he was quick

00:24:56.230 --> 00:25:02.220
to, to take the chip out of his camera before
they got to the car so they didn't get his

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:03.220
photos.

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:06.379
I mean, c'mon, we're not talking about, we're
talking about a huge building that hundreds,

00:25:06.379 --> 00:25:08.509
thousands of people work in.

00:25:08.509 --> 00:25:13.080
We got, so, in order, they wouldn't tell us
how many people worked there, so in order

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:17.509
to figure out how big it really is we got
the, the contractor that built the building

00:25:17.509 --> 00:25:21.880
was very proud of building the building and
said it was 500,000 square feet.

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:22.880
[laughter]

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:27.889
&gt;&gt;Dana Priest: And when I was there I spent
some of my time before and after the interviews

00:25:27.889 --> 00:25:31.600
driving around the parking lots, there are
two giant parking lots, counting the parking

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:35.720
spaces to figure out, ok, how many people
come to work every day.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:39.830
[chuckles] So that's pretty much how we found
out that it was that big.

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:44.299
It's the equivalent of stacking five Wal-Marts
on top of each other.

00:25:44.299 --> 00:25:49.909
And so it's gigantic and then you have to
say, ok, what goes on inside that is really

00:25:49.909 --> 00:25:51.570
keeping us safer?

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:57.129
And this is one of the co-, one of the agencies,
there are about three or four of them, big

00:25:57.129 --> 00:26:01.409
agencies, that people who work inside the
intelligence world are always criticizing

00:26:01.409 --> 00:26:05.029
for adding no value to the effort.

00:26:05.029 --> 00:26:07.840
But, as you see, it's grown really larger.

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.139
How 'bout the next one?

00:26:09.139 --> 00:26:11.510
We'll run through these pretty quick.

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:17.470
This is on the website that I was talking
to you about and it's, it's just the, it's

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:21.009
just the subset, it's the Washington area.

00:26:21.009 --> 00:26:24.349
But what I like about it and you can see it
better on the website are the buildings that

00:26:24.349 --> 00:26:27.080
are circling it.

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:33.809
Buildings became the symbol for this world
and how we could measure the world if we're

00:26:33.809 --> 00:26:34.809
outsiders.

00:26:34.809 --> 00:26:38.350
They were, they became important because you
could see them if you found them, you could

00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:39.600
take pictures of them.

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:40.789
But they're also permanent.

00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:42.690
These buildings are built to last.

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:48.320
And that says something important about this
whole enterprise, it's built to last a long

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:49.549
time.

00:26:49.549 --> 00:26:56.690
So here we've just listed the 33 largest buildings
in the Washington area and we could get square

00:26:56.690 --> 00:27:01.710
footage for all of them in the same way and
they turn out to be three times larger, they

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:02.919
equal three Pentagons.

00:27:02.919 --> 00:27:06.769
Which, I don't know if you've seen that, but
it's an enormous building.

00:27:06.769 --> 00:27:15.950
So just the 33 big ones equal in their space
3 Pentagons.

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:23.739
This is that job fair sign that I was telling
you about, Joe's Café.

00:27:23.739 --> 00:27:29.749
This is actually the NSA building at night,
which I got a lot of the details about that

00:27:29.749 --> 00:27:34.809
because they are expanding and the county
had a lot of records on the environmental

00:27:34.809 --> 00:27:40.119
impact of the expanding, including it had
this fun detail about how large their parking

00:27:40.119 --> 00:27:45.009
lot is, it's like 125 acres and you could
get somewhat of a sense.

00:27:45.009 --> 00:27:51.159
But it's an organization that has doubled
in size since 9/11 as most of the intelligence

00:27:51.159 --> 00:27:53.279
agencies have.

00:27:53.279 --> 00:27:54.529
Ok.

00:27:54.529 --> 00:27:57.129
And this is what's right across from it.

00:27:57.129 --> 00:28:01.749
This is just one company, Booz Allen Hamilton,
in that business park I was talking to you

00:28:01.749 --> 00:28:02.749
about.

00:28:02.749 --> 00:28:07.580
So I went there at night, got followed by
the NSA security police the whole time, drove

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:14.239
slowly, didn't make any sudden moves, but
you could get a sense of how big it is and

00:28:14.239 --> 00:28:19.229
it just went on also for a mile square probably.

00:28:19.229 --> 00:28:20.869
Ok.

00:28:20.869 --> 00:28:25.279
And then the issue of contractors and what
they do for the government came up.

00:28:25.279 --> 00:28:30.250
The law says they're supposed to do, they're
not supposed to do inherent governmental functions.

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:35.570
So they're really supposed to be there for
support, administrative, IT, other things.

00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:38.309
But the reality is they do everything.

00:28:38.309 --> 00:28:39.830
And this is my favorite example.

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:48.009
This is the wall at the CIA where people who
died in the line of duty, there's a star carved

00:28:48.009 --> 00:28:49.039
for them.

00:28:49.039 --> 00:28:56.269
And this man is the stone carver who's carving
a couple more stars for people who died after

00:28:56.269 --> 00:28:57.269
9/11.

00:28:57.269 --> 00:29:02.429
There are 22 stars for people who were killed
in the line of duty after 9/11 and of the

00:29:02.429 --> 00:29:05.109
22, 8 of them are contractors.

00:29:05.109 --> 00:29:11.239
So that tells you that contractors are doing
not just support work kind of on the periphery,

00:29:11.239 --> 00:29:14.159
but they're in the core of what the government
does.

00:29:14.159 --> 00:29:20.690
And both Donald Rumsfeld, or both Robert Gates,
Defense Secretary at the time, and Leon Panetta,

00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:25.870
CIA Director at the time I interviewed them
for this, had great concerns about how to

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:27.519
get that under control.

00:29:27.519 --> 00:29:33.200
Panetta said that he was worried that the
contractors' first alliance, allegiance was

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.950
to their companies, their profit-making companies.

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:42.099
Not to dis profit, but if, you know, what
company is ever gonna say, "No, we really

00:29:42.099 --> 00:29:45.019
don't need that contract, it's not gonna get
you anywhere."

00:29:45.019 --> 00:29:48.270
It just doesn't work that way.

00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:54.320
Bill, Bob Gates told me the story when I was
interviewing him of trying, a story that he

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:59.869
said "was embarrassing to tell, but I'll tell
you anyway" of trying to get the number of

00:29:59.869 --> 00:30:04.590
contractors that work in his own personal
office, the office of Secretary of Defense,

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:07.809
which is a big office, there are hundreds
of people there.

00:30:07.809 --> 00:30:08.809
But he couldn't get it.

00:30:08.809 --> 00:30:12.100
He asked his staff, "How many contractors
work here?" and they couldn't tell him.

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:18.690
And that's in part because contractors hire
subcontractors and there's not a record of

00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:24.159
who all the subcontractors are and that's
created a situation that the government really

00:30:24.159 --> 00:30:29.299
at any one time can't tell you how many contractors
work for it.

00:30:29.299 --> 00:30:35.950
We estimated out of the nearly 900,000 people
with top secret clearances that 250,000 of

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:42.049
them, a quarter of a million people, were,
were contractors, so a huge, you know, it's

00:30:42.049 --> 00:30:49.350
a huge deal and these days most of these agencies
they couldn't even function without the contractors.

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:57.320
The Department of Homeland Security, that,
they run on more contractors than federal

00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:58.880
employees.

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:03.309
So you know it's a huge part of what they
do.

00:31:03.309 --> 00:31:07.590
Finally, well let's see, what's the next?

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:11.509
Oh, the contractors have a good time with
their government officials.

00:31:11.509 --> 00:31:16.960
This is, this is a just a fun photo from the,
a Phoenix conference that I visited.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:20.279
It was a conference put on by the Defense
Intelligence agency.

00:31:20.279 --> 00:31:24.149
And the contractors that were there were trying
to you know sell their wares to the government

00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:30.380
officials, and this is a party put on by one
of them at which they were schmoozing, you

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:35.769
know having a good time with their government
people.

00:31:35.769 --> 00:31:40.269
This is another of the hubs that, ok, this
is the whole map.

00:31:40.269 --> 00:31:44.869
We didn't go down very far, we went down to
the to search city/state couplets is as far

00:31:44.869 --> 00:31:52.659
down as we could go, or not could go, we decided
to go because of again the security concerns.

00:31:52.659 --> 00:31:57.369
And I never really thought the map was as
good as it could be because I wanted to have

00:31:57.369 --> 00:32:00.879
those, you guys, I'm hoping you'll appreciate
this, but I really did wanna have, like, dots

00:32:00.879 --> 00:32:04.850
stacked on top of each other so you could
see the density instead.

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:10.349
The cartologists said, "No, if we can't be
exactly precise, we're not gonna pretend to

00:32:10.349 --> 00:32:12.679
be, you know, pretend to represent something."

00:32:12.679 --> 00:32:18.379
We had these big theological debates about,
[chuckles] about it, and they won.

00:32:18.379 --> 00:32:23.260
But the other thing, [laughs] the other thing
is on the side, on the left side is one of

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:28.450
my favorite discoveries, which is of the,
of the top, I think that's there.

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:31.330
Oh no, that's not there, ok.

00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:36.309
Well, somewhere on that website is one of
my favorite discoveries, which was that of

00:32:36.309 --> 00:32:42.940
the top, of the ten wealthiest counties in
the United States, this is Census Bureau data,

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:50.029
six of them are located in the most densest
clusters of Top Secret America.

00:32:50.029 --> 00:32:55.509
So you see the ripple effect of the, of this
growth is not just that government's getting

00:32:55.509 --> 00:33:02.799
bigger and companies are getting bigger, but
the you know disparity between the Washington

00:33:02.799 --> 00:33:08.039
region and the rest of the country you can
actually see.

00:33:08.039 --> 00:33:18.190
And all of those, each of those six counties
are, have a lot of Top Secret America intelligence

00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:20.010
work and agencies there.

00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:23.149
Ok, I think we have just a couple more.

00:33:23.149 --> 00:33:29.620
So the other thing that's happening, this
is Memphis, Tennessee, Real Time Crime Center.

00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:33.799
And the other thing that's happened is that
we're not just talking about the federal government,

00:33:33.799 --> 00:33:41.779
but all of this is trickling down in a different
form to the states and to local communities.

00:33:41.779 --> 00:33:49.549
And this Crime Center, which has just walls
of video screens connected to hundreds of

00:33:49.549 --> 00:33:54.950
cameras that are set up throughout Memphis
to watch people.

00:33:54.950 --> 00:34:00.289
It was funded in part by the Department of
Homeland Security.

00:34:00.289 --> 00:34:04.640
And what they want to do now, they're on a
couple camp, they're on a big campaign, it's

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:07.379
called See Something, Say Something.

00:34:07.379 --> 00:34:12.970
And it is what I, what I call a dragnet approach
to, to counter-terrorism, one that has no

00:34:12.970 --> 00:34:15.630
track record by the way.

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:21.110
However, it's one that they are pushing with
a lot of, they're pushing aggressively, and

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:22.110
they're funding it.

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:26.840
So they're trying to get the states to not
only build these fusion centers, but to turn

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:33.550
the local police and sheriff's departments
into the eyes and ears for the FBI, into tipsters.

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:40.190
And they're doing it not only by, by giving
them money to use certain technology and to

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:48.200
build certain things like these real time
crime centers, but also through grants for

00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:49.260
technology.

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:57.000
And the technology that seems to be more pervasive,
is technology that was developed for the battlefield,

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:03.530
but is migrating to the United States as companies
find that there's a market here for things

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:11.140
that helped soldiers figure out whether the
neighborhood was filled with neighbors that

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:15.190
belonged there or insurgents that didn't belong
there.

00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:21.310
Things like biometric and standoff biometrics,
where you know they can fingerprint people

00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:28.520
from a, remotely from a distance so you don't
even know it's happening, or mobile fingerprint

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:33.280
scanners so that if you get stopped at a for
a traffic violation they can ask you to give

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:35.590
you, give them your fingerprints.

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:45.420
Or, what I think is more powerful and less
and less viewed as, well it's just more powerful

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:51.640
and less known, is the, the databases that
are being created to fuse, to bring together

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:57.370
different types of information and to mine
that for nuggets that will point to abnormal

00:35:57.370 --> 00:36:01.270
patterns or that will pull out an individual.

00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:11.250
Part of the, one kind of database that's emerged
and is in the book is the FBI's Guardian Database

00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:19.720
and it's filled with, the DHS is undertaking
a they have these things called Suspicious

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:27.850
Activity Reports, SARs, and they want local
police but also citizens to fill them out

00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:33.110
if they see something, if they see somebody
doing something that's suspicious, that could

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:36.520
be an indicator of terrorism.

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:40.670
There's one, there's one county, I think it's
in Texas, which has actually developed an

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:46.850
app, so that if you get the app and then you
see somebody who's suspicious you could write

00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:51.650
out, you can fill it out right then and there
and click and mail it in to the Department

00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:55.800
of Homeland Security of that state and they
can maybe act on it.

00:36:55.800 --> 00:37:00.490
There's a reference in the book to a family
who was Middle-Eastern looking and they were

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:08.590
taking a picture of a fireboat at in the Balboa
harbor and they are now in this, in the database

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:13.850
because if you're driving a car that has your
registration on it it's easy for the police

00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:16.190
to you know note that.

00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:22.640
But the databases also, they, it can accumulate
a lot of information about you if you have

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:23.720
no criminal record.

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:30.070
If you do have a criminal record, it's gonna
have that in it for sure, but if you don't

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:35.620
because of another trend, which is just the
trend in coll-, in companies collecting private

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:40.780
information on people which the government
can now buy, just like the Washington Post

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:45.680
can buy it to help me do my reporting, but
the government can now buy a lot of the privacy

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:51.280
informa-, a lot of the private information
and without a warrant like it needed before

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:57.200
without probable cause that maybe you had
actually, not maybe but they thought it was

00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:02.310
probable that you had done something wrong,
now they can fill their database and your

00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:07.670
dossier with with some of this information
without getting a warrant.

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:12.160
So the databases are growing and you know
once you have a database with a lot of cool

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:17.790
data, you're gonna figure out what, [chuckles]
how to, how to use it, you're gonna try to

00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:21.490
mine it in different ways, this is sort of
the, I think you know this better than I do,

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:23.010
but kind of the nature of the beast.

00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:27.460
If you've got raw data sitting around why
not you know play with it?

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:31.450
Let's see, I think we got a, we have a couple
more photos.

00:38:31.450 --> 00:38:36.369
So there's another example of the kind of
technology that came from the battlefield.

00:38:36.369 --> 00:38:43.970
This is the automatic license plate reader
which allows police to drive by and their,

00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:50.950
their cameras will automatically import the
license plates around them, run the criminal

00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:56.920
checks, I was sitting in the car with this
guy who'd developed this for Memphis, and

00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:00.890
they could tell so many different things about
the driver of the vehicle.

00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:04.980
So if they had a warrant it would kind of
go 'boing', and they could pull them over

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:10.690
and make them pay or send them to jail if
you had an outstanding warrant.

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:16.520
If it was a, my favorite was convicted gangster,
that's what they called them.

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:17.520
[laughter]

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:21.230
&gt;&gt;Dana Priest: I wasn't quite sure what gangster
meant, but [laughing] and it would you know

00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:24.240
go like 'rrrrrrrrrrrrrr'.

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:32.170
And then of course they had convicted child
molester and gang member and drug dealer and

00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:34.530
all that.

00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:38.450
So really can do a lot with that kind of thing.

00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:42.480
Before I take your questions, let me just
get through a couple more photos and then

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:43.870
we can open it up for questions.

00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:44.870
&gt;&gt;Nick: That's it.

00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:45.870
&gt;&gt;Dana Priest: Ok.

00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:46.870
Oh, perfect timing.

00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:47.870
You had a question in the back.

00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:49.940
&gt;&gt;male #1: Yeah, actually I was just kind
of curious, it seems, um, um, obviously be

00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:56.430
guessing about how big the government's growing
and should they have all these tools?

00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:59.740
I'm wondering what your opinion is about,
is, is this too much?

00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:00.740
Is this--

00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:01.740
&gt;&gt;Dana Priest: Ok.

00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:05.800
The question was it seems like we're guessing
about how big it is but do we have an opinion

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:10.460
about whether the big, the, the largeness
is good and effective?

00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:12.360
I'm really not guessing.

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:19.900
I mean we, we, we wanted to put together,
we wanted to document this in a way that was

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:21.390
evidence based.

00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:22.390
Yeah.

00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:28.900
So, and, yes, the book and I do have an opinion
on it, and it comes from people on the inside

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:34.330
who were really helpful who were very discouraged
by what they were seeing.

00:40:34.330 --> 00:40:41.200
And so the bottom line is I think that we're
a lot safer than we were on 9/11, but it's

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:46.120
not because of this giant thing that we've
created that we call Top Secret America.

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:51.810
It is because there are organizations, they
tend to be relatively small, within this group

00:40:51.810 --> 00:40:59.830
of organizations, that have done some amazing
work and just to tell you what they are, probably

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:06.160
won't be any surprise, but domestically the
FBI's counter-terrorism agents, that's where

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:09.900
terrorism, that's where potential terrorists
have been identified.

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:16.130
By people who understand what they're doing
and have been doing it for a long time.

00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:22.280
Overseas the CIA analysts who ended up finding
the Bin Laden compound?

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:27.740
Those people, relatively small group, laser-focused
on their mission, have been doing it for a

00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:30.500
long time.

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:36.840
The special operations troops that we write
a whole chapter about them, they're really

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:42.240
a secret army that is grown up after 9/11
and has maintained more secrecy around it

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:45.140
than even the CIA's paramilitary operations.

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:51.220
They, if, if what you want is a group of people
to go and capture and kill, find, capture

00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:57.070
and kill likely terrorists, they're the people
you want to do it because they do it very

00:41:57.070 --> 00:41:58.480
effectively.

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:08.050
Their, their, their raids are about 50 percent
accurate according to sources inside, which

00:42:08.050 --> 00:42:13.900
doesn't sound that great, but it's better
than a lot of other military organizations

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:15.640
and there's always a cost to them.

00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:21.860
If they kill the wrong people there's huge
blow-back to those and there have been a lot

00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:24.750
of blow-back on these very secretive operations.

00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:31.080
So yes, I think we are safer, but not because
of this giant thing.

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:35.140
And in fact the giant thing is imploding on
itself.

00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:39.680
In part because it's so big and people with
inside don't even know, you know, what else

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:40.680
is inside.

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:44.650
&gt;&gt;male #1: Also, what's your opinion of Wikileaks
and Julian Assange and do you have any thoughts

00:42:44.650 --> 00:42:45.650
about that?

00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:48.940
&gt;&gt;Dana Priest: So two different questions,
first of all.

00:42:48.940 --> 00:43:01.080
You know, I met Julian before all the hoopla
and I would say that I'm not a great fan personally

00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:12.080
and I think that his, his, some of his anti-American
statements are, are not helpful and you know,

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:14.380
whatever, wrong-headed.

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:20.590
However, I think the revelations that have
come out of the Wikileaks and the idea that

00:43:20.590 --> 00:43:26.380
there is such an organization that at least
is an anti-secrecy organization should not

00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:33.700
be discounted at all and that we, and that
those documents provided some of the most

00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:38.580
interesting revelations about our own government
in a long time.

00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:44.190
Do I think that you know he's damaged national
security like some government officials have

00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:46.770
claimed?

00:43:46.770 --> 00:43:49.770
We haven't seen that yet.

00:43:49.770 --> 00:43:51.040
It could be.

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:53.760
He was very sloppy in the beginning.

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:59.740
I think he didn't even understand how outing
government documents could put lives at risk,

00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:01.410
like the lives of sources.

00:44:01.410 --> 00:44:07.280
I know some of the reporters who worked with
him on the first tranche of, of articles who

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:13.150
did know, because they had worked in this
field for a long time, and, and one of them

00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:18.380
said, you know we took our baseball bats out
at the very end before publication to drill

00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:23.520
into him that you had to be responsible with
this information because there were things

00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:29.190
that should not be public because it will
put people's lives at risk.

00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:35.240
So I think the in general the government's
overreacted tremendously to Wikileaks in an

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:36.240
uh.

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:41.400
But the other interesting thing about Wikileaks
which I write about in the book, is the government's

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:46.930
done a counterintelligence assessment of this,
like how did it happen?

00:44:46.930 --> 00:44:48.180
How vulnerable are we?

00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:50.380
How vulnerable are our documents?

00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:55.450
Because one of the things they quickly discovered
was that the State Department, where all these

00:44:55.450 --> 00:45:01.420
cables came from, you know they, they put
a lot out on their, on their secret network,

00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:06.880
called SIPRNet and, and it's easy to access
or it was at the time.

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:11.940
I mean, it's easy, it was very easy to access
if you had that level of classification and

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:14.620
it shouldn't have been as easy as it was.

00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:17.010
And they did that because they have no clue
what they're doing.

00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:19.010
And that's what the the assessment found.

00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:23.080
The assessment found that government agencies
that are supposed to be keeping secrets don't

00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:30.150
have a clue, by and large, of how easy it
is for people to break in or to get access

00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:32.940
and not really need to have access.

00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:39.420
The, the conclusion of the book has this very
fun, I, fun in my perverted way, this, this

00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:46.500
fun parallel universe of on the one hand the
government after 9/11 cracked down on public

00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:51.770
information, declared a war on terrorism once
it was declared a war you know everything

00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:54.400
was secret because it could aid the enemy.

00:45:54.400 --> 00:46:03.600
At the same time, technology marches on and
I, I go up and interview the, the guys at

00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:09.930
a company, a pretty small company called Traversa,
that works for private companies trying to

00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:16.240
find their proprietary information that's
made its way out of the company's secured

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:20.860
site for various reasons, usually because
employees bring their work home and usually

00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:26.580
because their kids have file share software
and then that's like opening your door to

00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:31.290
your house and there are all these people
that do nothing more than go into houses looking

00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:32.660
for interesting files.

00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:38.130
And so they've found what they call the tuna
in the, the dolphin in the tuna nets, they've

00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:43.040
found a lot of government classified information
out there because people working for the government

00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:46.400
have put it out there unknowingly.

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:52.450
That's to say that while the government's
scurrying around trying to keep you from information

00:46:52.450 --> 00:46:57.830
that I at least think is in the public interest
to know, to know whether our government's

00:46:57.830 --> 00:47:05.920
on the right course or not, technology is
making that all obsolete in a, in a certain

00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:07.460
ad hoc way.

00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:10.680
And the people who study this inside government
know it.

00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:16.070
They know that they are losing this battle
and that there's this involuntary transparency

00:47:16.070 --> 00:47:21.220
that's occurring that Wikileaks best, best
symbolizes.

00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:26.830
So even people whose job it is to keep out,
to keep information from falling into the

00:47:26.830 --> 00:47:33.610
wrong hands, now believe that there's no way
they can win in that situation and that the

00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:41.270
only way to really, the only way to really
work with it is to declassify many government

00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:50.480
secrets and to reassess what secrecy means
and to keep secret only what really needs

00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:55.960
to be kept secret and to do it in a way that
you know you can maintain that secrecy, because

00:47:55.960 --> 00:48:04.320
as this project shows you, you know, it's,
it's hard to keep a secret these days.

00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:07.590
So with that I think this is a good point
to take more questions.

00:48:07.590 --> 00:48:08.590
Ok.

00:48:08.590 --> 00:48:09.590
Yeah.

00:48:09.590 --> 00:48:11.330
&gt;&gt;male #2: You haven't mentioned the left
or the right in terms of political responsibility,

00:48:11.330 --> 00:48:19.020
so I'm curious, like, how much of this came
under the Bush administration, granted that

00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:20.480
was closer to when 9/11 happened.

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:21.480
&gt;&gt;Dana Priest: Yeah.

00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:25.290
&gt;&gt;male #2: How much has been either added
on to that or reversed under Obama?

00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:30.120
&gt;&gt;Dana Priest: So it all grew up under, under
President Bush.

00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:35.790
All the, a lot of the, most of the agencies
that we write about, most of the legal interpretations

00:48:35.790 --> 00:48:41.130
that allowed organizations like the Special
Operations to, to do what they do and in that

00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:42.720
certain way.

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:45.200
But most of it has been continued under Obama.

00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:51.930
He came in talking about transparency, talking
about the rule of law and disbanding some

00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:55.380
of the more controversial things.

00:48:55.380 --> 00:49:01.700
By and large he's not done any of that and
he's taken the Bush blueprint for counter-terrorism

00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:03.430
overseas and run with it.

00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:09.830
He's increased the lethal drone strikes and
he has increased the number of organizations

00:49:09.830 --> 00:49:16.950
that work in Top Secret America by allowing
those, by allowing the individual agencies

00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:23.080
to create more of them and by not stepping
back and assessing, you know, where are we

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:24.370
now?

00:49:24.370 --> 00:49:29.210
What is really the threat, which I think is
step number one, is to have the government

00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:31.950
speak more honestly with us about the threat.

00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:36.550
There are several hundred Al-Qaeda left because
those organizations I was talking to you about

00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:39.640
before were effective in killing them off.

00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:45.620
And, yes, there have been new affiliates that
have sprung up, but the more effective organizations

00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:52.440
within this world, they have a, a good read
on them and they're, you know, likely to defeat

00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:53.820
them, too.

00:49:53.820 --> 00:50:00.220
So we don't have, but we aren't given the
opportunity to know much, still about what

00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:04.660
is the real threat so you can then say, ok,
if this is the threat, this is what it looks

00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:07.340
like, what are we willing to spend on that?

00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:15.500
It's the basic risk analysis and, and we're
not there yet in part because it's not politically,

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:20.520
it's a bad idea to bring it up if you're a
member, if you're an elected official, one

00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:25.990
side or the other is gonna call you soft on
terrorism and then if there's another plot

00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:33.110
or a plot that's un, you know, that's stopped
even, but if there's a smaller incident that

00:50:33.110 --> 00:50:35.650
happens, you know, you'll be blamed.

00:50:35.650 --> 00:50:40.930
And so I think that even the public has to
take some responsibility for not engaging

00:50:40.930 --> 00:50:45.660
in an honest discussion of what all this costs,
what's it worth, what is the threat?

00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:51.100
Because we're part of the problem in that
every time something might happen, you know,

00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:56.920
you can bet that the media for sure is gonna
say you know, "Who's at fault here?"

00:50:56.920 --> 00:51:01.490
And the answer, the solution to all of that
is more.

00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:08.400
More money, more agents, more contractors,
more analysis papers, more, more, more.

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:13.280
[chuckles] And I'd argue that that's not the
right approach anymore.

00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:14.280
Right behind you.

00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:18.120
&gt;&gt;male #3: So you, you talk a lot about how
you took very, very necessary precautions

00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:20.060
to avoid publishing anything that could be
damaging.

00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:21.060
&gt;&gt;Dana Priest: Right.

00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:25.370
&gt;&gt;male #3: Was that, was that part of your
core philosophy originally or, or how much

00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:36.630
of that was affected by the last, the last
week in, the last week of August when David

00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:43.010
Leigh's book on Wikileaks published the encryption
key for all of the unredacted cables?

00:51:43.010 --> 00:51:46.240
&gt;&gt;Dana Priest: Oh, what you just mentioned
came out long before, I mean came out after

00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:47.880
all these decisions were made.

00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:56.000
No, it comes from my work on in the intelligence
and military world where I come across information

00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:02.610
that's pretty sensitive sometimes and every
time that that happens we have an unofficial

00:52:02.610 --> 00:52:07.530
procedure in which we, you know I'll get to
the point of having finished a story that

00:52:07.530 --> 00:52:13.460
has that information in, I'll call the government
up, I'll tell them what I have, so that they,

00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:17.620
if they want to, they can make a case that
something shouldn't be published.

00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:21.830
But the decision is my editor's, or the editor
of the Washington Post.

00:52:21.830 --> 00:52:26.030
But we need to know what the concern is in
order to even make a decision about it.

00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:30.180
And sometimes you're, you have something that
you know is sensitive, but you might not know

00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:36.510
how sensitive, so the government engages in
a discussion with the paper over these issues

00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:40.270
and, but the paper makes the final decision.

00:52:40.270 --> 00:52:44.980
So in the secret sites, the black sites, the
editor, you know, which went all the way up

00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:49.940
to the President, and our editor decided that
we would, we would put all the story in the

00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:52.620
paper except we wouldn't name the countries.

00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:56.370
We had several countries where we knew the
prisons were, but we named the region, which

00:52:56.370 --> 00:52:58.850
was Eastern Europe.

00:52:58.850 --> 00:53:01.580
So that's the sort of trade off.

00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:02.670
Is that it?

00:53:02.670 --> 00:53:03.670
Ok.

00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:07.560
&gt;&gt;Nick: Well, I think we have to end it, but
please join me in thanking Dana Priest for

00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:08.560
coming.

00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:08.561
[applause]
