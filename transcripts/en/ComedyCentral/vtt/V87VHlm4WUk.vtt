- So the guy is
yelling at his dog.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.605
He's like, "What are you doin'?

00:00:06.605 --> 00:00:07.840
"Don't bark at that bird,
stop barking at the bird."

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.041 align:start size:84% position:16%
And the dog's like,
"Um, I'm a dog,

00:00:09.041 --> 00:00:11.410
"and I mean, it's a
bird, it's what I do,

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.048
"like what?"
(woman laughs)

00:00:16.215 --> 00:00:19.118 align:start size:88% position:13%
- People in LA are so
insane about their dogs.

00:00:19.118 --> 00:00:20.753
- And then there's
a bird in the tree,

00:00:20.753 --> 00:00:23.556
was like, "Um, hey Dumbo,

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:25.759 align:start size:88% position:13%
"I'm a bird, you're
supposed to bark at me.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.060
"Hello, hello!"

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:31.296
- (laughs) You're so
good at impressions.

00:00:31.296 --> 00:00:33.867
(laughs) I just, I could never.

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:34.867
I could never.

00:00:34.867 --> 00:00:37.370
- It's just real
life, I love it.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.905
(slow clapping)

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:41.040
- Bravo, bravo.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.108
Absolute bravo.

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:43.409
- Hey, Luke.

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:44.244
- Hey.

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:46.646 align:start size:81% position:19%
You know what,
that was just ama,

00:00:46.646 --> 00:00:48.147
the way you told that story,

00:00:48.147 --> 00:00:50.216
it was like she was eatin'
out of the palm of your hand.

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:51.050
That was amazing.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.385
- Uh, thank you,

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.554
Luke Sado?

00:00:55.554 --> 00:00:59.992
From Broken Family, that
show was my childhood!

00:00:59.992 --> 00:01:00.960
Holy shit.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.228
- (chuckles) God, you know,

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:03.295
I really enjoyed your
dog walking story.

00:01:03.295 --> 00:01:04.463
I hope you don't mind, I was,

00:01:04.463 --> 00:01:05.431 align:start size:84% position:16%
I wasn't even
tryin' to eavesdrop,

00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:06.466
it was just the way you said it,

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.833
it was just like gripping.

00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:09.101 align:start size:94% position:6%
It was like a documentary
I was watchin'.

00:01:09.101 --> 00:01:09.935
What's your, your name is--

00:01:09.935 --> 00:01:11.438
- My name's Gary.

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:12.638
My name's Gary.

00:01:12.638 --> 00:01:13.606
You can change it
if you want to.

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:15.141
- No, why would I change it?

00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:16.442
Are you a Sea Falcon?

00:01:16.442 --> 00:01:18.144
- How the fuck did
you know that, man?

00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:18.978
(Luke whistles)

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:20.647
Oh, uh yeah, yeah.

00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:21.781
Are you alumni?

00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:23.015 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I'm not an
alumni, actually no,

00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:24.850
but I banged a waitress
that went there once.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:25.784
- No!

00:01:25.784 --> 00:01:26.952
- That's actually pretty cool.

00:01:26.952 --> 00:01:28.320
- Oh god, you're buttin' in.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.156
You're butting in and
uh, but it is cool.

00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:31.591 align:start size:84% position:16%
She but in, but
she's actually right,

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:32.458
it is very cool.

00:01:32.458 --> 00:01:33.660
- That's really cool.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.795
- Right, how's the
acting going, Gary?

00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:37.596 align:start size:81% position:19%
- How did you know
I was an actor?

00:01:37.596 --> 00:01:40.032 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Luke, you are like
low-key magical.

00:01:40.032 --> 00:01:41.467
- I know, I don't
believe in magic.

00:01:41.467 --> 00:01:43.368 align:start size:97% position:3%
Maybe she believes in
magic, which is very stupid,

00:01:43.368 --> 00:01:44.637
but I don't believe in magic.

00:01:44.637 --> 00:01:46.138 align:start size:84% position:16%
I do believe in
deductive reasoning,

00:01:46.138 --> 00:01:49.008 align:start size:97% position:3%
and I deduced that you didn't
just come here from Iowa,

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:52.044 align:start size:97% position:3%
all the way to LA to sell
rocks, you know what I mean?

00:01:52.044 --> 00:01:53.012
(laughing)

00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:55.481
- Oh, yeah, no, pfft, yeah,

00:01:55.481 --> 00:01:56.649 align:start size:81% position:19%
no shit.
- Go get my usual.

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:57.484
- Yes.

00:01:58.685 --> 00:01:59.685
- Did you have any
plans this weekend?

00:01:59.685 --> 00:02:01.187
- No, I have nothing going on.

00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:02.488
- Like a loser?

00:02:02.488 --> 00:02:04.323
Okay, well, look, I do
this thing at my house,

00:02:04.323 --> 00:02:05.825
it's very casual.

00:02:05.825 --> 00:02:07.359
It's a charade night.

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:08.627 align:start size:84% position:16%
Yeah, we get together,
we play games,

00:02:08.627 --> 00:02:10.162
but you tell such good stories

00:02:10.162 --> 00:02:12.532
that I figure that
you could come in

00:02:12.532 --> 00:02:14.867 align:start size:84% position:16%
and kind of like
secretly be my ringer.

00:02:14.867 --> 00:02:17.336
- Are you inviting me
to your charades party?

00:02:17.336 --> 00:02:18.170
Oh my--

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.004
- Okay.

00:02:19.004 --> 00:02:20.306
- Yeah

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:21.707
- Okay but calm down,
I love Midwesterners.

00:02:21.707 --> 00:02:22.909 align:start size:94% position:6%
I always feel like I
could trust Midwesterners,

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:24.910 align:start size:81% position:19%
and you're a what,
you're a what?

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:25.745
You're a--
- Libra.

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:26.979
- No, Midwesterner.

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:29.148 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Yes, you can trust
people from the Midwest,

00:02:29.148 --> 00:02:31.150
but you can trust
me, Luke, 100%.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.584
I am full-on Midwest.

00:02:32.584 --> 00:02:35.321 align:start size:88% position:13%
Here, let me get your
number just so I don't--

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:36.689
- Okay, of course I'm not
gonna give you my number,

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.857
but I'm gonna give
you my third email,

00:02:38.857 --> 00:02:42.195
and that goes right to
my second assistant,

00:02:42.195 --> 00:02:43.529
so there you go.

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:44.430
- Awesome.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.765
- Here's your Soul Scrub.

Broken Family was
my favorite show.

00:03:06.385 --> 00:03:07.587
I grew up watching it.

00:03:07.587 --> 00:03:10.256
Luke Sado's like a
brother to me, dude.

00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:11.757

brother to all of us,

00:03:11.757 --> 00:03:15.060

huge deal for my career,

can't fuck this up, Rick.

mentor me, and take
me under his wing.

00:03:21.133 --> 00:03:22.635

- B, no Snapchatting.

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:34.413
- Of course not.

00:03:34.413 --> 00:03:36.082
- And C, most importantly,

Who's this sexy

to meet you, sir.

Lieutenant Rick. (laughs)

00:04:18.658 --> 00:04:21.160
Anyway, this is my
girlfriend Alyssia.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.696
- Which one is the one you
said is from Shit Town, USA?

00:04:23.696 --> 00:04:26.766
- Oh, (laughs)

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:30.269 align:start size:97% position:3%
no, I actually said
Shitville, USA, sweetheart.

00:04:30.269 --> 00:04:31.170
That's Gary.

Remember, he's my ringer.

00:04:33.105 --> 00:04:34.307
- Me?

00:04:34.307 --> 00:04:35.341
Oh no, I'm just here
for moral support,

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:37.977
and I train Gary
in martial arts.

00:04:37.977 --> 00:04:39.178
Yah!

00:04:39.178 --> 00:04:40.880
- Oh, god, you know
what, that's so cool.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:41.947
Gary, I wish when I
first moved out here

00:04:41.947 --> 00:04:43.182
that my friends came with me,

00:04:43.182 --> 00:04:44.683
'cause it's so tough in
the business, you know?

00:04:44.683 --> 00:04:46.051
It's good to have that support.

00:04:46.051 --> 00:04:47.853
I mean, I ended up bunking with

00:04:47.853 --> 00:04:50.056
Robert Downey Jr. and
Brad Pitt, but uh,

00:04:50.056 --> 00:04:51.523
whatever, that's
all in the past.

00:04:51.523 --> 00:04:52.825
Anyway, you want a beer, Rick?

00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:54.327
- Three, please.

00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:55.794
Do you think I could get a
selfie with you real quick?

00:04:55.794 --> 00:04:58.164
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.

00:04:59.064 --> 00:05:01.066

00:05:01.066 --> 00:05:01.901

00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:02.735
- Rick, you. (sighs)

00:05:02.735 --> 00:05:04.002
- No, it's cool.

00:05:04.002 --> 00:05:05.237 align:start size:75% position:25%
(camera clicks)
- Yeah.

00:05:05.237 --> 00:05:07.306
Do you think you could
re-post that for me?

00:05:07.306 --> 00:05:09.341
- (growling) Rick.

00:05:09.341 --> 00:05:10.409
- No, it's okay, chill.

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:11.410
Uh, you know what, yeah.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:12.411
You know what, I'll re-post it,

00:05:12.411 --> 00:05:13.679
and how about I follow you too.

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:14.646
Huh?

00:05:14.646 --> 00:05:16.048
I'll follow you on Instagram.

00:05:16.048 --> 00:05:17.350 align:start size:97% position:3%
Cool, let's go get you
those three beers, come on.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.984

00:05:18.984 --> 00:05:22.322
(lazy electronic music)

00:05:24.323 --> 00:05:26.091
Uh, Apollo 13.

00:05:26.091 --> 00:05:26.992
- [Rick] Apocalypse Now?

00:05:26.992 --> 00:05:28.995
- [Gary] Eat: The Movie.

00:05:30.028 --> 00:05:31.230
- Eat, Pray, Love.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.332
- Yes, Eat, Pray,
Love, obviously.

00:05:33.332 --> 00:05:34.566
- She's good.

00:05:34.566 --> 00:05:36.501
- It's not, it was
just really easy.

00:05:36.501 --> 00:05:38.370
All right, look, it
doesn't matter, okay.

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.572
(claps) Gary, your turn.

00:05:39.572 --> 00:05:40.840
The ringer's up, come on.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:41.941
- [Rick] Get 'em, get 'em.

00:05:41.941 --> 00:05:42.775
- Okay.

00:05:43.876 --> 00:05:45.210
All right. (clears throat)

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.046
Okay, here we go.

00:05:47.046 --> 00:05:48.013
- [Luke] All right.

00:05:48.013 --> 00:05:48.914
- I get one pass, right?

00:05:48.914 --> 00:05:50.416
I'm gonna pass on this one.

00:05:50.416 --> 00:05:51.584
(group groans)
Yeah, let me go--

00:05:51.584 --> 00:05:53.419 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Oh, come on, you're
not gonna pass.

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:54.253
Would Leo pass?

00:05:54.253 --> 00:05:55.087
Leo wouldn't pass.

00:05:55.087 --> 00:05:56.121
So what would Leo do?

00:05:56.121 --> 00:05:57.389
Come on.

00:05:57.389 --> 00:05:59.091
What would Leo do, come
on, what would Leo do?

00:05:59.091 --> 00:06:00.859
- [Group] What would Leo do?

00:06:00.859 --> 00:06:02.228
What would Leo do?

00:06:02.228 --> 00:06:03.262
- Okay, okay.

00:06:04.764 --> 00:06:06.865 align:start size:88% position:13%

okay, okay, okay, okay.

00:06:06.865 --> 00:06:07.867

00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:10.036
Okay.

00:06:15.741 --> 00:06:17.476
(Gary squeals)

00:06:19.444 --> 00:06:21.146
- Oh, uh, Planet of the Apes.

00:06:21.146 --> 00:06:22.648
- [Luke] I don't
know, what is that?

00:06:22.648 --> 00:06:24.250
- Um, (beeping)

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:25.451 align:start size:81% position:19%
(whimpers)
- Glass slippers.

00:06:25.451 --> 00:06:26.819
- Drag.

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:28.488
- Goodfellas.

00:06:28.488 --> 00:06:30.756 align:start size:84% position:16%
- (laughs nervously)
Ha, ha, mmm.

00:06:30.756 --> 00:06:31.590
- [Luke] Second word.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.760
- Okay, hmm, (grunts)

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.763
- [Luke] Gorillas in the Mist.

00:06:36.763 --> 00:06:37.930
- Uh, Robocop?

00:06:39.298 --> 00:06:40.132
Crispy.

00:06:40.132 --> 00:06:41.767
- [Luke] Oh, uh, X-Men.

00:06:41.767 --> 00:06:44.403
Oh, what's that movie

00:06:44.403 --> 00:06:45.571 align:start size:75% position:25%
(Gary whimpers)
Cymbals?

00:06:45.571 --> 00:06:46.939
You're a monkey on acid?

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:47.773
You're on acid?

00:06:47.773 --> 00:06:48.607
Acid?

00:06:48.607 --> 00:06:50.008
- Mm, pah! Toy Story.

00:06:50.008 --> 00:06:51.444
It was Toy Story.

00:06:52.511 --> 00:06:53.779
- Toys.

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:54.747
- Oh.

00:06:54.747 --> 00:06:55.647
- I didn't want to do it.

00:06:55.647 --> 00:06:56.615
I said I didn't want to do it,

00:06:56.615 --> 00:06:58.584
that's why I want to pass.

00:06:58.584 --> 00:07:00.019
I said it, I said that.

00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:03.088 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Okay, well, uh,
yeah, maybe next time

00:07:03.088 --> 00:07:06.492
we'll have a pass
rule or something.

00:07:06.492 --> 00:07:07.760
- [Rick] That was good.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.495
- No, it was okay,
but, how about Rick?

00:07:09.495 --> 00:07:10.796
Rick can get us
back in the game.

00:07:10.796 --> 00:07:12.031
Come on, Rick, your turn.

00:07:12.031 --> 00:07:13.766
- [Rick] You did a good
try, that was all right.

00:07:13.766 --> 00:07:17.002
- It was toys and
shit, you know?

00:07:17.002 --> 00:07:18.104
Oh, fuck.

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:20.706
- Woo, uh. (laughs)

00:07:20.706 --> 00:07:21.541
Okay.

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:30.216
(gagging and coughing)

00:07:35.454 --> 00:07:36.289
- Choke.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.027
Tie?

00:07:42.027 --> 00:07:44.997
(gagging)

00:07:44.997 --> 00:07:47.166
- Autoerotic asphyxiation!

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:51.370
Shit.

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:53.705
- What the fuck
did you just say?

00:07:53.705 --> 00:07:55.675
What did you just fuckin' say?

00:07:55.675 --> 00:07:56.909
(glass breaks)

00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:58.477
I invite you into my
home for game night,

00:07:58.477 --> 00:08:01.513
I invite you to my house,
and that's what you say.

00:08:01.513 --> 00:08:04.483
- Guys, guys, it
was Transformers.

00:08:04.483 --> 00:08:06.852
- How the fuck was
that Transformers?

00:08:06.852 --> 00:08:07.986
- You know what,
I got a good idea,

00:08:07.986 --> 00:08:09.888 align:start size:84% position:16%
why don't you
transform into a bird

00:08:09.888 --> 00:08:12.825 align:start size:84% position:16%
and fly out of my cool
fuckin' house, huh?

00:08:12.825 --> 00:08:14.827
(laughing)

00:08:14.827 --> 00:08:16.361
Why don't you do that?

00:08:16.361 --> 00:08:17.562
- Um, okay.

00:08:17.562 --> 00:08:19.197 align:start size:84% position:16%
Do you want that
bird to drop you off

00:08:19.197 --> 00:08:21.100
at one of the, what, 30 rehabs

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:22.701
you had to fuckin' go to?

00:08:22.701 --> 00:08:24.270
I think that's what
TMZ said, right, 30?

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:25.504
Is that right?

00:08:25.504 --> 00:08:27.072
30!

00:08:27.072 --> 00:08:29.875 align:start size:97% position:3%
(determined electronic music)
- No!

00:08:29.875 --> 00:08:32.278 align:start size:84% position:16%
You know I can't swim!
(splashing)

00:08:32.278 --> 00:08:33.211
I can't swim.

00:08:33.211 --> 00:08:35.615
- Hey, now that's good acting.

00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:38.217
What is he doing?

00:08:38.217 --> 00:08:40.052
You don't belong here.

00:08:41.253 --> 00:08:43.288
Hollywood isn't for you, losers.

00:08:43.288 --> 00:08:44.757
Pack up and get the fuck out.

00:08:44.757 --> 00:08:45.590
(laughing)

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:46.425
- [Rick] You okay?

00:08:46.425 --> 00:08:48.728
- Yeah. (gasps)

00:08:48.728 --> 00:08:51.296
- (groans) Fuck.

00:08:51.296 --> 00:08:52.531
Fuck!

00:08:52.531 --> 00:08:55.067 align:start size:88% position:13%
Yeah, all right, you
know what, he fucked up.

00:08:55.067 --> 00:08:56.101
Whoop dee doo, man.

00:08:56.101 --> 00:08:57.970
He was nervous to be around you.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:59.237
He's your biggest fan.

00:08:59.237 --> 00:09:00.873
We both are, okay?

00:09:00.873 --> 00:09:02.107
That's a loyal friend.

00:09:02.107 --> 00:09:04.409
He would never sell a
tape of you jerkin' off

00:09:04.409 --> 00:09:06.545
with a noose around your neck,

00:09:06.545 --> 00:09:09.915 align:start size:94% position:6%
you fuckin' creep, 'cause
he's a real friend.

00:09:09.915 --> 00:09:11.417
You should get some,

00:09:11.417 --> 00:09:13.652
not like this little dick
brigade you got around you,

00:09:13.652 --> 00:09:16.322
or your whore model from Saturn.

00:09:17.622 --> 00:09:19.658
- That was really good acting.

00:09:19.658 --> 00:09:22.561
(Rick sighs)

00:09:22.561 --> 00:09:24.897
- Yep, my phone's done.

00:09:24.897 --> 00:09:26.232
- Uh, yeah.

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:28.000
(dripping)

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.335 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I wished you would
have just guessed

00:09:29.335 --> 00:09:32.605 align:start size:84% position:16%
that it was fuckin'
Transformers.

00:09:32.605 --> 00:09:35.908 align:start size:84% position:16%
- What scene in
Transformers was that?

00:09:35.908 --> 00:09:37.309
- Dude, it was the
scene at the very end

00:09:37.309 --> 00:09:39.178 align:start size:97% position:3%
where the Autobot's hangin'
off the fuckin' thing

00:09:39.178 --> 00:09:40.947
by an extension cord?

00:09:42.147 --> 00:09:44.616
- Michael Bay wouldn't
have fucking got that.

00:09:44.616 --> 00:09:47.686
(sighs) Thanks for
that speech, man.

00:09:47.686 --> 00:09:49.755
