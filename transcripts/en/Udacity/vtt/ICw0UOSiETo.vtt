00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.445
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What's the sort of design process, I mean I've made my shock absorber

00:00:03.445 --> 00:00:06.985
designed it on my three d program and now what do I do, do I hit a button and

00:00:06.985 --> 00:00:11.782
send this to a printer or how's that really work? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; So most three d prints work

00:00:11.782 --> 00:00:17.542
off STL files or OBJ files and almost any 3D software program can export to STL

00:00:17.542 --> 00:00:22.194
or OBJ. So once you do that, then you can decide what kind of 3D printing is

00:00:22.194 --> 00:00:25.773
going to work best for you. Or maybe it's just what's accessible to you.

00:00:25.773 --> 00:00:29.962
Something like this was built on an SLA machine, which means it printed similar

00:00:29.962 --> 00:00:34.020
to a hot glue gun when printed, right? Where it's a, a hot piece of material

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.616
coming through a hot head and printing out layer by layer and building that up.

00:00:38.616 --> 00:00:42.634
Where this one's great. Worst sound in the world but, yeah. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; [laugh] But it's

00:00:42.634 --> 00:00:46.993
flexible. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Pretty awesome. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; And what's really great about it is

00:00:46.993 --> 00:00:51.089
there's a billion ways to show people on screen your design and your idea, but

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:55.249
most people don't really understand that until they can hold it in their hands

00:00:55.249 --> 00:00:59.246
and feel it. So, that's really the advent of 3D printing is when I can take this

00:00:59.246 --> 00:01:02.723
to my boss and say, look this is going to save us so much because of this

00:01:02.723 --> 00:01:06.650
design. Look at how much material, you know we've saved or, you know this is

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.779
going to work so much better this way that's, that's kind of the glory of it.
