00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.870
the research that I'm doing at Carnegie

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:06.880
the research that I'm doing at Carnegie
 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.320
the research that I'm doing at Carnegie
Mellon University concerns how to build

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.330
Mellon University concerns how to build
 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.560
Mellon University concerns how to build
technologies that are socially aware

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570
technologies that are socially aware
 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.800
technologies that are socially aware
that is technologies that can sense the

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.810
that is technologies that can sense the
 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.019
that is technologies that can sense the
social skills of the people that they're

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:19.029
social skills of the people that they're
 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.080
social skills of the people that they're
interacting with that can engage people

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.090
interacting with that can engage people
 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.410
interacting with that can engage people
in a social relationship and that can

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.420
in a social relationship and that can
 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.010
in a social relationship and that can
ensure that that relationship is the

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020
ensure that that relationship is the
 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.350
ensure that that relationship is the
underpinning of the work that the

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.360
underpinning of the work that the
 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.779
underpinning of the work that the
computer and the person do together the

00:00:33.779 --> 00:00:33.789
computer and the person do together the
 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:35.490
computer and the person do together the
importance of the research that I'm

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500
importance of the research that I'm
 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.490
importance of the research that I'm
doing is to ensure that in this

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500
doing is to ensure that in this
 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.430
doing is to ensure that in this
increasingly technological age we

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440
increasingly technological age we
 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.729
increasingly technological age we
maintain a focus on those aspects of

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739
maintain a focus on those aspects of
 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.190
maintain a focus on those aspects of
humanity that are most important to us

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.200
humanity that are most important to us
 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.920
humanity that are most important to us
that we ensure that we don't lose the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930
that we ensure that we don't lose the
 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.310
that we ensure that we don't lose the
social bonds between people and the

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320
social bonds between people and the
 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.110
social bonds between people and the
relationships that we build with one

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120
relationships that we build with one
 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.560
relationships that we build with one
another

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570
another
 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.290
another
which after all are what make us human

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300
which after all are what make us human
 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.959
which after all are what make us human
and so the technologies that I build

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969
and so the technologies that I build
 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.810
and so the technologies that I build
don't replace people they collaborate

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820
don't replace people they collaborate
 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.630
don't replace people they collaborate
with people they don't destroy people

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640
with people they don't destroy people
 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.470
with people they don't destroy people
they build relationships with people

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.480
they build relationships with people
 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.540
they build relationships with people
