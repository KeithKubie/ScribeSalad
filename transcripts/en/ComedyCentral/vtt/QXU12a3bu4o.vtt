00:00:02.835 --> 00:00:03.569
- We are Ficus and Fern.

00:00:03.602 --> 00:00:04.570
 That's Fern.

00:00:04.603 --> 00:00:05.605
 - And that's Ficus.

00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:06.572
This is,

00:00:06.605 --> 00:00:08.174
 - [Both] Best Dressed Fest.

00:00:08.207 --> 00:00:09.609
  - Last I checked,

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:11.177
there was only room at Coachella
for one celestial goddess.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.479
 And you, sir, are not Rihanna.

00:00:13.512 --> 00:00:14.947
  - Don't try this at home.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.016
  You'll end up looking less
  like a sexy disco ball

00:00:17.049 --> 00:00:18.851
 and more like a
 freaky glitter ghost.

00:00:18.884 --> 00:00:20.453
  - Literal garbage.

00:00:20.486 --> 00:00:22.488
 - This scarlet harlot
 is stealing the show

00:00:22.521 --> 00:00:24.424
 with her fiery
 throwback tracksuit,

00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:25.992
 really channeling JLo here.

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:28.428
 - Making this queen the
 hottest Jenny on the block.

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:29.629
  A must do.

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:30.997
(upbeat music)
(Ficus screams)

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.899
 She looks like a haunted doll.

00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:35.802
 And who did her makeup,
 Annabelle from The Conjuring?

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:37.370
- She's like the
duchess of Candy Kingdom

00:00:37.403 --> 00:00:39.105
  with a gingersnap
  cookie for a hat.

00:00:39.138 --> 00:00:40.773
 100%, please don't.

00:00:40.806 --> 00:00:41.808
 - Love this.

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:44.277
David Bowie on vacation.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.612
  - More like Tilda
  Swinton at home.

00:00:46.645 --> 00:00:49.282
  - And now, for
  definitely do not.

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:51.017
 - Definitely do not.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.218
 - [Both] Appropriate.

00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:53.119
 - Culturally.

00:00:53.152 --> 00:00:53.986
 Quite simple.

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:55.455
 - Just stop doing it.

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:57.723
- We hope this helped enlighten
your future trendy selves.

00:00:57.756 --> 00:01:00.994
 Dress well, and see
 you at Clusterfest.
