00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.640
Another method that we could use to impute missing

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.700
values in a data set is to perform linear regression

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.320
to estimate the missing values. We'll cover linear regression

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.080
in more depth in the next lesson. But the general

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.770
idea is that we would create an equation that

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.060
predicts missing values in the data using information we do

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.080
have, and then use that equation to fill in our

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.670
missing values. Okay so, what are the drawbacks of using

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.480
this linear regression type technique? Well, one negative

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.690
side effect of imputing missing values in this

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.600
way is that we would over emphasize existing

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.580
trends in the data. For example, if, if

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.740
there is a relationship between date of birth

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.390
and height in MLB players, all of our

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.300
imputed values will amplify this trend. Additionally, this

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.940
model will produce exact values for the missing entries,

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.690
which would suggest a greater certainty in the missing values than

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.500
we actually have. In any case, let's say we did want

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.790
to fill in the missing values for weight in our baseball

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.580
player data. We could train a linear model using the existing

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.890
data that we have, and then use that model to fill

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.842
in these missing values. Let's say we did want to fill

00:01:09.842 --> 00:01:12.438
in the missing values for weight in our baseball data. We

00:01:12.438 --> 00:01:15.949
could train a linear model using our existing data. That is,

00:01:15.949 --> 00:01:19.009
entries that have position, left or right

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.599
handed batter, average, birthdate, deathdate, height and

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:25.779
weight. And then use that model that

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:28.410
we've created to fill in these missing values.
