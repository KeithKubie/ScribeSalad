[DRUMS PLAYING]

00:00:05.016 --> 00:00:07.640
ETHAN THAI: So right now, we're
sweeping a 100-foot by 100-foot

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.490
area with metal detectors
looking for things,

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.090
such as iron, musket
shot, canister,

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.972
any remnants of the battle.

00:00:15.972 --> 00:00:17.430
NATHAN ARRINGTON:
We are here today

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.350
at the Princeton Battlefield
with Humanities 350,

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.630
a course called
"Battle Lab," whose goal

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.390
is to investigate the
Princeton Battlefield,

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.750
to teach students about
archaeology hands on,

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.150
and to get them to engage
with cultural heritage

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.030
and preservation right
here in their own backyard.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.550
RACHAEL DELUE: Nathan said,
hey, how about a class where we

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.140
excavate something near campus?

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.370
And he said, what about
the Princeton Battlefield?

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.600
And I said, that's perfect.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.730
You're an archaeologist.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.340
I am an art historian that
studies early America.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.450
What if we bring our
methods together,

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.180
what if we bring the
tools of our trade

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.960
together, to see if we can
unlock the Battle of Princeton

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.910
to bring new information,
new knowledge,

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.300
and make the picture of what
really happened here that day

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.330
more clear?

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.732
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.490
CLARE COOK: There's definitely
a really wide variety

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.100
of majors represented in the
class, which is pretty cool.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.654
So there's people like me
that had no archaeology --

00:01:20.654 --> 00:01:22.820
and I haven't taken any
other history classes here --

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.710
and then there's
other people who

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.780
are in the archaeology
certificate program

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.490
or have done history.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.130
So it is really neat to
get different insights

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.462
into those things.

00:01:32.462 --> 00:01:34.670
RACHAEL DELUE: I work on
the history of American art,

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.470
and working on the
history of American art

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.470
means that I have to be a
specialist in American history.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.030
And so I'm always thinking about
the larger contexts in which

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.280
art is produced, and
Princeton's museum

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.470
owns an incredibly
interesting painting

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.080
by Charles Willson Peale
of George Washington

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.470
at the Battle of Princeton.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.300
CLARE COOK: So
yeah, there is a lot

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.924
of interesting things
from the painting

00:01:54.924 --> 00:01:57.505
that I don't think I
would have noticed myself.

00:01:57.505 --> 00:01:59.630
So I understood that, back
then, you could actually

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.864
see Nassau Hall from
the battlefield,

00:02:02.864 --> 00:02:04.280
and this is even
reflected in some

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.320
of the artwork we've looked at.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.410
A lot of times, the battle
is portrayed from the field,

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.494
but you can see Nassau
Hall in the background.

00:02:12.494 --> 00:02:13.910
NATHAN ARRINGTON:
Across the road,

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.270
we're doing metal detection,
very systematic metal detection

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.941
to try to recover
artifacts from the battle,

00:02:19.941 --> 00:02:22.190
but also from the periods
before and after the battle.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.594
[METAL DETECTOR SOUNDING]

00:02:23.594 --> 00:02:25.760
ETHAN THAI: We could have
something else right here.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.343
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.110
[BEEP]

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.590
Here we go.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.360
ETHAN THAI: So this is a cut
nail, an extremely rusted cut

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.800
nail.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.800
Having not taken a history
class in quite a long time,

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.260
I thought it'd be good
to just learn more

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.860
about the American Revolution,
the start of this nation.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.320
But also alongside
with that, I do

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.004
enjoy the mechanical,
the technical side

00:02:54.004 --> 00:02:55.920
of things too and using
technology like ground

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.340
penetrating radar earlier,
metal detectors here,

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.650
and other tools in the
excavation, archaeology field.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.667
It's a great intersection
of everything.

00:03:04.667 --> 00:03:06.500
NATHAN ARRINGTON: A
ground penetrating radar

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.390
is a noninvasive way to
cover a lot of territory

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.670
and try to find out some
more information about what

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.400
happened here and how
it was interpreted.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.040
RACHAEL DELUE: We want students
to have moments where they're

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.010
digging deep into time
and into the past,

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.770
and they confront something
that is wholly unfamiliar

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.370
and have these transformative
moments when they're there

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.450
looking at something
that they thought

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.180
was simply a plot of grass.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.780
And by excavating it both
literally and metaphorically,

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.030
they're encountering
something altogether new.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.660
And that's transformative
in the sense

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.790
that, all of a
sudden, their world

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.740
becomes a different
one -- their world now,

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.670
but also their sense of
their place in history.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.330
So excavation here is literal
as well as metaphorical.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.280
It's a matter of what it
means to produce knowledge,

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.060
but also self-awareness
and a sense of ourselves

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.940
as humans in the 21st century.
