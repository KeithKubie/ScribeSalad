00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200
Social Sciences but I learned a
 

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.989
Social Sciences but I learned a
different hat which is really why I'm

00:19:50.989 --> 00:19:50.999
different hat which is really why I'm
 

00:19:50.999 --> 00:19:53.450
different hat which is really why I'm
here which is the leader of the Simon

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:53.460
here which is the leader of the Simon
 

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:55.190
here which is the leader of the Simon
initiative which is named after herb

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200
initiative which is named after herb
 

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.340
initiative which is named after herb
Simon and is an effort that really spans

00:19:58.340 --> 00:19:58.350
Simon and is an effort that really spans
 

00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:01.999
Simon and is an effort that really spans
all the colleges so I'm not sure they'll

00:20:01.999 --> 00:20:02.009
all the colleges so I'm not sure they'll
 

00:20:02.009 --> 00:20:03.889
all the colleges so I'm not sure they'll
be happy about this but I'm gonna

00:20:03.889 --> 00:20:03.899
be happy about this but I'm gonna
 

00:20:03.899 --> 00:20:05.419
be happy about this but I'm gonna
represent work going on in everybody's

00:20:05.419 --> 00:20:05.429
represent work going on in everybody's
 

00:20:05.429 --> 00:20:08.810
represent work going on in everybody's
College today yeah so um the focus of

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:08.820
College today yeah so um the focus of
 

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.359
College today yeah so um the focus of
this work is on really being smart about

00:20:11.359 --> 00:20:11.369
this work is on really being smart about
 

00:20:11.369 --> 00:20:13.609
this work is on really being smart about
applying technology and learning science

00:20:13.609 --> 00:20:13.619
applying technology and learning science
 

00:20:13.619 --> 00:20:16.599
applying technology and learning science
to education and I think that we all

00:20:16.599 --> 00:20:16.609
to education and I think that we all
 

00:20:16.609 --> 00:20:19.369
to education and I think that we all
would agree that in the future smart

00:20:19.369 --> 00:20:19.379
would agree that in the future smart
 

00:20:19.379 --> 00:20:21.710
would agree that in the future smart
cities and metro areas will need higher

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:21.720
cities and metro areas will need higher
 

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.799
cities and metro areas will need higher
quality education both for K through 16

00:20:24.799 --> 00:20:24.809
quality education both for K through 16
 

00:20:24.809 --> 00:20:27.139
quality education both for K through 16
and for the workforce because the needs

00:20:27.139 --> 00:20:27.149
and for the workforce because the needs
 

00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:28.220
and for the workforce because the needs
of the workforce are gonna change

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:28.230
of the workforce are gonna change
 

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:30.499
of the workforce are gonna change
rapidly and what we're gonna need to do

00:20:30.499 --> 00:20:30.509
rapidly and what we're gonna need to do
 

00:20:30.509 --> 00:20:32.570
rapidly and what we're gonna need to do
is develop very high quality education

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:32.580
is develop very high quality education
 

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:36.169
is develop very high quality education
that trains students from early early on

00:20:36.169 --> 00:20:36.179
that trains students from early early on
 

00:20:36.179 --> 00:20:39.019
that trains students from early early on
and is able to train workers to adapt

00:20:39.019 --> 00:20:39.029
and is able to train workers to adapt
 

00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:41.960
and is able to train workers to adapt
new jobs new demands in quick ways and

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:41.970
new jobs new demands in quick ways and

intelligently demonstrably effective
 

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:48.320
intelligently demonstrably effective
ways and so we found out many many

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:48.330
ways and so we found out many many
 

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:51.049
ways and so we found out many many
things from applying what we call

00:20:51.049 --> 00:20:51.059
things from applying what we call
 

00:20:51.059 --> 00:20:52.759

00:20:52.759 --> 00:20:52.769
learning science research over the last
 

00:20:52.769 --> 00:20:55.489
learning science research over the last
25 years and one of them that I think

00:20:55.489 --> 00:20:55.499
25 years and one of them that I think
 

00:20:55.499 --> 00:20:59.149
25 years and one of them that I think
has become almost dominant is that one

00:20:59.149 --> 00:20:59.159
has become almost dominant is that one
 

00:20:59.159 --> 00:21:01.999
has become almost dominant is that one

two groups of meeting it's we want to
actually do compute in the cameras so

00:30:27.469 --> 00:30:27.479
actually do compute in the cameras so
 

00:30:27.479 --> 00:30:29.299
actually do compute in the cameras so
that we're sending much less information

00:30:29.299 --> 00:30:29.309
that we're sending much less information
 

00:30:29.309 --> 00:30:33.710
that we're sending much less information
out and that seems possible to the final

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:33.720
out and that seems possible to the final
 

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:36.019
out and that seems possible to the final

piece which is really interesting and I
think I don't want to promise anything

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:37.590
think I don't want to promise anything
 

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:39.169
think I don't want to promise anything
but I think we've got a chance of doing

00:30:39.169 --> 00:30:39.179
but I think we've got a chance of doing
 

00:30:39.179 --> 00:30:43.879
but I think we've got a chance of doing
this properly folks who use this as an

this properly folks who use this as an
opportunity to put encryption in the

opportunity to put encryption in the
 

00:30:46.409 --> 00:30:48.919
opportunity to put encryption in the
cameras or on the streetlights so that's

00:30:48.919 --> 00:30:48.929
cameras or on the streetlights so that's
 

00:30:48.929 --> 00:30:51.469

like this so we so we're trying to kill

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:56.970
like this so we so we're trying to kill
 

00:30:56.970 --> 00:31:00.710

00:31:01.969 --> 00:31:01.979
privacy and how do we make it
 

00:31:01.979 --> 00:31:04.729
privacy and how do we make it
computationally tractable and again I

00:31:04.729 --> 00:31:04.739
computationally tractable and again I
 

00:31:04.739 --> 00:31:06.049
computationally tractable and again I
don't want to promise anything but I

00:31:06.049 --> 00:31:06.059
don't want to promise anything but I

don't want to promise anything but I
think if we actually get some kind of

think if we actually get some kind of
 

00:31:09.479 --> 00:31:11.989
think if we actually get some kind of

that can can can work with us and then
implement it in the city context because

00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:56.580
implement it in the city context because
 

00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:58.369
implement it in the city context because
it's just not going to be possible to

00:33:58.369 --> 00:33:58.379
it's just not going to be possible to
 

00:33:58.379 --> 00:34:00.649
it's just not going to be possible to
just have the academic institutions and

00:34:00.649 --> 00:34:00.659
just have the academic institutions and
 

00:34:00.659 --> 00:34:03.109
just have the academic institutions and
in cities working alone as Don pointed

00:34:03.109 --> 00:34:03.119
in cities working alone as Don pointed
 

00:34:03.119 --> 00:34:04.690
in cities working alone as Don pointed
out we can have some tremendous

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:04.700
out we can have some tremendous
 

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:07.759
out we can have some tremendous
illustrative projects and things that

00:34:07.759 --> 00:34:07.769
illustrative projects and things that
 

00:34:07.769 --> 00:34:10.430
illustrative projects and things that
will move things along but we need to

00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:10.440
will move things along but we need to
 

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:16.940
will move things along but we need to
have partners in Metro 21 so let me

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:16.950
have partners in Metro 21 so let me
 

00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:19.909
have partners in Metro 21 so let me
build on what Jim said I think the the

00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:19.919
build on what Jim said I think the the
 

00:34:19.919 --> 00:34:23.299
build on what Jim said I think the the
biggest constraint I think has to do

00:34:23.299 --> 00:34:23.309
biggest constraint I think has to do
 

00:34:23.309 --> 00:34:25.789
biggest constraint I think has to do
with who's going to pay for all of this

00:34:25.789 --> 00:34:25.799
with who's going to pay for all of this
 

00:34:25.799 --> 00:34:29.930
with who's going to pay for all of this
and so at the idea of figuring out an

00:34:29.930 --> 00:34:29.940
and so at the idea of figuring out an
 

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:31.899
and so at the idea of figuring out an
appropriate business model

00:34:31.899 --> 00:34:31.909
appropriate business model
 

00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:35.169
appropriate business model
is going to be quite critical and I

00:34:35.169 --> 00:34:35.179
is going to be quite critical and I
 

00:34:35.179 --> 00:34:37.419
is going to be quite critical and I
think the there are two two aspects to

00:34:37.419 --> 00:34:37.429
think the there are two two aspects to
 

00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:41.079
think the there are two two aspects to
this I think one is even even the the

00:34:41.079 --> 00:34:41.089
this I think one is even even the the
 

00:34:41.089 --> 00:34:43.839
this I think one is even even the the
success that Metro 21 has had to date

00:34:43.839 --> 00:34:43.849
success that Metro 21 has had to date
 

00:34:43.849 --> 00:34:46.930
success that Metro 21 has had to date
has relied on a really deep partnership

00:34:46.930 --> 00:34:46.940
has relied on a really deep partnership
 

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:49.720
has relied on a really deep partnership

that's somebody else's issue so figuring

00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:21.950
that's somebody else's issue so figuring
 

00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:25.150
that's somebody else's issue so figuring
out how the incentives can be aligned

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:25.160
out how the incentives can be aligned
 

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:28.089
out how the incentives can be aligned
and what the public policy model might

00:35:28.089 --> 00:35:28.099
and what the public policy model might
 

00:35:28.099 --> 00:35:29.859
and what the public policy model might
be and what and this is something that

00:35:29.859 --> 00:35:29.869

in what we do because there's all sorts

00:35:59.079 --> 00:35:59.089
in what we do because there's all sorts
 

00:35:59.089 --> 00:36:00.730
in what we do because there's all sorts
of need and all sorts of demand that's

00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:00.740
of need and all sorts of demand that's
 

00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:03.160

a big opportunity loss so I think that

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:07.730
a big opportunity loss so I think that
 

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:09.940
a big opportunity loss so I think that

to tell us like what skills they really

00:41:57.940 --> 00:41:57.950
to tell us like what skills they really
 

00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:59.850
to tell us like what skills they really
need to learn so we could go after those

00:41:59.850 --> 00:41:59.860
need to learn so we could go after those

behind the creation of the smart

00:46:56.229 --> 00:46:56.239
behind the creation of the smart
 

00:46:56.239 --> 00:46:57.839
behind the creation of the smart
infrastructure Institute it was

00:46:57.839 --> 00:46:57.849
infrastructure Institute it was
 

00:46:57.849 --> 00:47:00.069
infrastructure Institute it was
recognizing that the infrastructure

00:47:00.069 --> 00:47:00.079
recognizing that the infrastructure
 

00:47:00.079 --> 00:47:02.890
recognizing that the infrastructure
grades continue to be if any of our kids

00:47:02.890 --> 00:47:02.900
grades continue to be if any of our kids
 

00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:04.900
grades continue to be if any of our kids
brought those that report card home we

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:04.910
brought those that report card home we
 

00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:06.729
brought those that report card home we
would be pretty upset

00:47:06.729 --> 00:47:06.739
would be pretty upset
 

00:47:06.739 --> 00:47:10.390
would be pretty upset
it's but the plus at fast and in fact no

00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:10.400
it's but the plus at fast and in fact no
 

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:13.089
it's but the plus at fast and in fact no
I sorry that the the best grade was C

00:47:13.089 --> 00:47:13.099
I sorry that the the best grade was C
 

00:47:13.099 --> 00:47:17.079
I sorry that the the best grade was C
for the bridge condition the the

00:47:17.079 --> 00:47:17.089
for the bridge condition the the
 

00:47:17.089 --> 00:47:19.479
for the bridge condition the the
challenge is again gathering the data

00:47:19.479 --> 00:47:19.489
challenge is again gathering the data
 

00:47:19.489 --> 00:47:22.239
challenge is again gathering the data
accurate and meaningful data about the

00:47:22.239 --> 00:47:22.249
accurate and meaningful data about the
 

00:47:22.249 --> 00:47:24.609
accurate and meaningful data about the
infrastructure so the the super

00:47:24.609 --> 00:47:24.619
infrastructure so the the super
 

00:47:24.619 --> 00:47:26.349
infrastructure so the the super
structures you can actually send people

00:47:26.349 --> 00:47:26.359
structures you can actually send people
 

00:47:26.359 --> 00:47:28.630
structures you can actually send people
on to look at now we're starting to use

00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:28.640
on to look at now we're starting to use
 

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:31.269
on to look at now we're starting to use
more and more sensing to get better

00:47:31.269 --> 00:47:31.279
more and more sensing to get better
 

00:47:31.279 --> 00:47:33.190
more and more sensing to get better
information about the bridges but the

00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:33.200
information about the bridges but the
 

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:35.019
information about the bridges but the
Buried infrastructure is where I think

00:47:35.019 --> 00:47:35.029
Buried infrastructure is where I think
 

00:47:35.029 --> 00:47:38.140
Buried infrastructure is where I think
there's the real uncertainty we don't

00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:38.150
there's the real uncertainty we don't
 

00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:40.029
there's the real uncertainty we don't
know what the state of a lot of our

00:47:40.029 --> 00:47:40.039
know what the state of a lot of our
 

00:47:40.039 --> 00:47:43.569
know what the state of a lot of our
buried infrastructures in and so I think

00:47:43.569 --> 00:47:43.579
buried infrastructures in and so I think
 

00:47:43.579 --> 00:47:46.269
buried infrastructures in and so I think
first we have to commit to recognizing

00:47:46.269 --> 00:47:46.279
first we have to commit to recognizing
 

00:47:46.279 --> 00:47:48.009
first we have to commit to recognizing
we we need to gather more information

00:47:48.009 --> 00:47:48.019
we we need to gather more information
 

00:47:48.019 --> 00:47:50.950
we we need to gather more information
about that that infrastructure and then

00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:50.960
about that that infrastructure and then
 

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:53.559
about that that infrastructure and then
we have to realistically look at the

00:47:53.559 --> 00:47:53.569
we have to realistically look at the
 

00:47:53.569 --> 00:47:56.079
we have to realistically look at the
data and and and make decisions about

00:47:56.079 --> 00:47:56.089
data and and and make decisions about
 

00:47:56.089 --> 00:47:58.450
data and and and make decisions about
what are the highest priorities I was

00:47:58.450 --> 00:47:58.460
what are the highest priorities I was
 

00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:01.210
what are the highest priorities I was
not kidding about my dream is that we

00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:01.220
not kidding about my dream is that we
 

00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:04.660
not kidding about my dream is that we
get it's like a Minority Report for for

00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:04.670
get it's like a Minority Report for for
 

00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:07.089
get it's like a Minority Report for for
you know that movie Minority Report for

00:48:07.089 --> 00:48:07.099
you know that movie Minority Report for
 

00:48:07.099 --> 00:48:08.799
you know that movie Minority Report for
infrastructure where you get a report

00:48:08.799 --> 00:48:08.809
infrastructure where you get a report
 

00:48:08.809 --> 00:48:10.749
infrastructure where you get a report
that this water main is going to break

00:48:10.749 --> 00:48:10.759
that this water main is going to break
 

00:48:10.759 --> 00:48:11.610
that this water main is going to break
in

00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:11.620
in
 

00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:14.190
in
in another week and you can either spend

00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:14.200
in another week and you can either spend
 

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:17.280
in another week and you can either spend
you know ten thousand dollars addressing

00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:17.290
you know ten thousand dollars addressing
 

00:48:17.290 --> 00:48:19.650
you know ten thousand dollars addressing
it now or you can spend a you know sixty

00:48:19.650 --> 00:48:19.660
it now or you can spend a you know sixty
 

00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:21.930
it now or you can spend a you know sixty
thousand dollars after it happens I

00:48:21.930 --> 00:48:21.940
thousand dollars after it happens I
 

00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:24.110
thousand dollars after it happens I
think anybody with presented with that

00:48:24.110 --> 00:48:24.120
think anybody with presented with that
 

00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:27.530
think anybody with presented with that
opportunity would take the $10,000

00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:27.540
opportunity would take the $10,000
 

00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:30.990
opportunity would take the $10,000
option if in fact the data is relatively

00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:31.000
option if in fact the data is relatively
 

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.690
option if in fact the data is relatively
accurate in terms of its prediction and

00:48:33.690 --> 00:48:33.700
accurate in terms of its prediction and
 

00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:36.240
accurate in terms of its prediction and
I think we don't have that kind of

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:36.250
I think we don't have that kind of
 

00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:37.440
I think we don't have that kind of
information right now

00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:37.450
information right now
 

00:48:37.450 --> 00:48:40.320
information right now
about our infrastructure in a way that

00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:40.330
about our infrastructure in a way that
 

00:48:40.330 --> 00:48:44.370
about our infrastructure in a way that
allows policymakers to to you know make

00:48:44.370 --> 00:48:44.380
allows policymakers to to you know make
 

00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:47.100
allows policymakers to to you know make
that kind of temporal decision but on

00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:47.110
that kind of temporal decision but on
 

00:48:47.110 --> 00:48:48.480
that kind of temporal decision but on
the other hand we do have a lot of

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:48.490
the other hand we do have a lot of
 

00:48:48.490 --> 00:48:50.490
the other hand we do have a lot of
information about our infrastructure

00:48:50.490 --> 00:48:50.500
information about our infrastructure
 

00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:53.700
information about our infrastructure
that is is currently being ignored and I

00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:53.710
that is is currently being ignored and I
 

00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:55.110
that is is currently being ignored and I
think we need to solve the larger

00:48:55.110 --> 00:48:55.120
think we need to solve the larger
 

00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:57.600
think we need to solve the larger
problem about you know are we are we as

00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:57.610
problem about you know are we are we as

a community serious about having a first

00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:00.670
a community serious about having a first
 

00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:02.820
a community serious about having a first
you know first world infrastructure are

00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:02.830
you know first world infrastructure are
 

00:49:02.830 --> 00:49:05.010
you know first world infrastructure are
we going to be satisfied with a third

00:49:05.010 --> 00:49:05.020
we going to be satisfied with a third
 

00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:07.470
we going to be satisfied with a third
world infrastructure in fact I've been

00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:07.480
world infrastructure in fact I've been
 

00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:09.120
world infrastructure in fact I've been
in third world countries quote-unquote

00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:09.130
in third world countries quote-unquote
 

00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:11.160

they have a cement either better roads

00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:11.170
they have a cement either better roads
 

00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:14.220
they have a cement either better roads
than we do in something the other point

00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:14.230
than we do in something the other point
 

00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:16.680
than we do in something the other point
I would add is there's much talk about

00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:16.690
I would add is there's much talk about
 

00:49:16.690 --> 00:49:19.890
I would add is there's much talk about
again how do we pay for it so I think

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:19.900
again how do we pay for it so I think
 

00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:21.570
again how do we pay for it so I think
this public-private partnerships that

00:49:21.570 --> 00:49:21.580
this public-private partnerships that
 

00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:24.090
this public-private partnerships that
have been talked about I think that's

00:49:24.090 --> 00:49:24.100
have been talked about I think that's
 

00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:25.830
have been talked about I think that's
going to be have to be a critical piece

00:49:25.830 --> 00:49:25.840
going to be have to be a critical piece
 

00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:29.160
going to be have to be a critical piece
of one educating policymakers like Jim

00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:29.170
of one educating policymakers like Jim
 

00:49:29.170 --> 00:49:31.050
of one educating policymakers like Jim
was talking about the other piece is

00:49:31.050 --> 00:49:31.060
was talking about the other piece is
 

00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:34.110
was talking about the other piece is
figuring out a viable model great I

00:49:34.110 --> 00:49:34.120
figuring out a viable model great I
 

00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:36.120
figuring out a viable model great I
think we're about out of time first

00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:36.130
think we're about out of time first
 

00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:38.820
think we're about out of time first

00:49:46.370 --> 00:49:46.380
I think I think this will spur a lot of
 

00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:48.470
I think I think this will spur a lot of
