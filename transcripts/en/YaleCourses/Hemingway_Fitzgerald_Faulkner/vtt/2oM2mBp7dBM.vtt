1
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.400
Oh,
one to

2
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.700
refresh your memory about what we talked about last time,
um,

3
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.180
about the kindness of strangers last time we spent a lot of time talking about

4
00:00:21.181 --> 00:00:24.010
kindness of strangers and in many ways,
um,

5
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.240
as this as an instance of Faulkner updating a long tradition of thinking about

6
00:00:31.051 --> 00:00:35.580
hospitality.
Um,
and also thinking about pregnancy,

7
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.300
uh,

8
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.070
outside of wedlock or even with when you are in a marriage that the father is

9
00:00:41.071 --> 00:00:45.570
not,
the thought is not your husband.
Um,
so leader updating,

10
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.060
Lina,
updating leader

11
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.220
from the Greek classics.
Um,

12
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.620
but also thinking about community and thinking about Lenas relation to the

13
00:00:57.901 --> 00:01:02.901
southern community as an updating southern hospitality as an updating of the

14
00:01:04.571 --> 00:01:05.940
ancient,
uh,

15
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.800
Greek ideal of hospitality to strangers.
So do,

16
00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:13.650
they will be,
um,
thinking more about that,

17
00:01:13.651 --> 00:01:17.310
but introducing a new term,
um,

18
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.230
and bring Christianity into play.

19
00:01:19.231 --> 00:01:23.590
As you guys probably know that as Christians is very important in lighting

20
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.870
artists,
um,

21
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.930
and especially the Christian concept of how we should condemn ourselves towards

22
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.370
our neighbors.
Right?

23
00:01:32.371 --> 00:01:37.371
So we'll be thinking about that and the various permutations of their Christian

24
00:01:37.801 --> 00:01:41.550
idea of treat your neighbor as day stuff.
Um,
and,

25
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.180
but before we go into there that,

26
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.190
just want to talk a little bit about the narrative structure of a lady in Argos.

27
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.900
Obviously a leaner is one very important have of the narrative.

28
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.640
Uh,
she represents the undramatic have,
it's a narrative,
very peaceful,

29
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.440
very monotonous dealing where your drama can come into a part of the story is

30
00:02:04.441 --> 00:02:09.441
when a supporting cast tick all there and the upstage her and become the

31
00:02:09.601 --> 00:02:13.230
protagonist for,
there's just that short period of time.
Um,

32
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.630
so the undramatic narrative,
um,

33
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.220
revolving around Lina and those people where she comes into contact with.

34
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.450
And then opposite to that,
um,

35
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.330
is a very dramatic structure actually.
And we're beginning to see that,
uh,

36
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.640
in the reference to do any burden and the house being burned down and the

37
00:02:32.641 --> 00:02:37.480
spectators.
And it will be good to have some human fat me to,
uh,
to,

38
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.990
to quicken the fire.
So I'm very,

39
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.520
very dramatic development and various other,
uh,

40
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.040
characters has to contribute to that dramatic narrative.

41
00:02:47.041 --> 00:02:49.290
So we'll be looking at Joanna burden,
uh,

42
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.030
reverend hightower and obviously Joel Christmas.
Um,
so,

43
00:02:54.031 --> 00:02:54.900
but,
um,

44
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.780
I just want to start by going back and looking squarely at this engine engine,

45
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.290
um,
from the vinegars,
um,
which is probably the,
you know,

46
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.380
one of the central tenants of Christianity.
Um,

47
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.030
and we should take it not just the last line,

48
00:03:10.031 --> 00:03:14.610
which is the land that all of us know,
but take it in its full context.
Um,

49
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:15.910
you should not use,

50
00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:20.911
shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against the sons of young people,

51
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.310
but usually love your neighbor as yourself.
I am the board,

52
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.970
so I'm loving your neighbor is in the context of Europe obeying God,

53
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.580
right?
So that is the,
that is,

54
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.990
it is under the rubric of your devotion to God,

55
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.940
your obedience to God,
um,
that you should love your neighbor.

56
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.060
But it's further,
um,

57
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.120
thicken by the notion that you should not take vengeance against others.

58
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.670
We might not necessarily,
um,

59
00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.170
thing of the prohibition against vendors that we don't really associate

60
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.180
Christianity with the prohibitation against vengeance.
Um,

61
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.910
there's just no prohibition,
um,

62
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.150
in our current against vendors and our current legal and ethical thinking.

63
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.910
Um,

64
00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.650
that period of justice is an instance where actually collected vendors.

65
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.960
So it is institutionalized.
There's no prohibition against vengeance,

66
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.830
but actually within,
at least in the videos,

67
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.980
there's a prohibition against vengeance.
So with the thing about what that means,

68
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.900
um,
and,
and putting that also under the rubric of loving your neighbor.

69
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.570
So all of this,
um,
is um,

70
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.880
very important to like the in August.

71
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.030
But I want to further introduce one other consideration,

72
00:04:49.031 --> 00:04:53.790
which is a relatively new book that came up by three very important,
um,

73
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.680
thinkers and philosophers as love as Usia.

74
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.590
Um,
Eric Center Standard and um,

75
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.850
run kind of ran home,
call the neighbor,
the three of them.
Um,

76
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.350
each had an essay in this book called the neighbor.
Um,

77
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:16.410
and the org is really thinking about what the concept of neighbor could mean

78
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:23.040
after the Holocaust and after the numerous instances of genocide with witness in

79
00:05:24.881 --> 00:05:27.370
the 20th century and the 20th first century,

80
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.400
it seems that the whole human propensity is to turn against those amount whom

81
00:05:32.771 --> 00:05:36.860
you've lived all your life.
It takes such a short space of time,
you know,

82
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.300
generation,
some people might been living together in the same place.

83
00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.080
All of a sudden you're turn against the person next door to you.
So,
um,

84
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:50.190
the three philosophers thing of this as a case of political theology,

85
00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.560
it's a very interesting concept.
Um,

86
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.620
is thinking about the ethics of social conduct and behavior towards people who

87
00:05:58.971 --> 00:06:03.470
are not kin to you,
um,
who have no blood ties to you.

88
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.700
Um,
you have no obligation other than just the obligation of treating them as

89
00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:12.190
neighbors and what the appropriate conduct would be,
where the,
the limits,
um,

90
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.910
to be in someone's neighbors and what are the licenses that you can take.
Um,

91
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.220
so I'm very,
you know,
I would encourage you to just to take a look at this book,

92
00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.300
um,
if you just want to do some reading and philosophy.
Um,

93
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.250
but I now let's go back to what we've been talking about a little bit last time

94
00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:35.990
and just want to remind you of this,
um,
discussion,

95
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:40.300
this conversation that comes right at the heels of thinking about Brian

96
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:44.900
[inaudible] been in love.
It's the big fire in other side.
What can I be?

97
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.430
I don't remember anything out that way big enough to make all that smoke except

98
00:06:49.431 --> 00:06:52.370
that burden.
How is maybe that's what it is.
And the other side,

99
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.580
my pepe says he can't remember how 50 years ago folks said it ought to be burned

100
00:06:58.041 --> 00:07:01.220
with a low human fat meat to start a good,

101
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:05.930
maybe your pappy slipped up there instead of the five the site.
They all laughs.

102
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:11.120
Um,
so this is the other phase of the community.
Uh,

103
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.980
with going along with Lena,

104
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:17.390
we have this idea that human beings are just all kindness and that's all there

105
00:07:17.391 --> 00:07:18.470
is.
But you know,

106
00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:22.010
we sort of just know from experience that that's probably just half the story.

107
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:23.030
Um,

108
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:28.030
so Faulkner is very emphatic about showing us the other phase of the neighbor of

109
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.040
um,
and um,

110
00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:36.020
and there's a genealogy to the burden house in Kipling's poem.

111
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.820
Um,
the white man's burden,
um,

112
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:43.870
that people who do good or consider themselves to do good quite often actually

113
00:07:44.511 --> 00:07:47.930
incur.
Uh,
the resentment of those they do,

114
00:07:47.931 --> 00:07:52.730
could do is interesting kind of psychological dynamics that take up the white

115
00:07:52.731 --> 00:07:57.731
man's burden and re Pisco reward the blame of those leave better.

116
00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:02.210
The hate of those you got.
Um,

117
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:06.980
I think that they actually is quite a natural human tendency not to want to be,

118
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:10.630
you know,
to have to get other people,
um,

119
00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:15.530
taking care of you,
uh,
or in this particular way of doing good to you.

120
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:16.460
Um,

121
00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:21.460
and so resentment essentially kind of a natural reaction and what the white

122
00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:25.230
man's burden means.
Uh,

123
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:30.240
especially in the context of doing good two different race and obviously that

124
00:08:31.311 --> 00:08:35.960
issue.
It was front and center,
uh,
drain reconstruction,

125
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.790
uh,
when you have artists lays becoming Freeman and what to do and how to educate

126
00:08:40.791 --> 00:08:45.050
them and induct them really into citizenship.
Um,

127
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:49.310
so the lots of northern reformers when south,

128
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:50.210
um,

129
00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:55.210
and a lot of them including Joanna burdens family had the idea that they would

130
00:08:56.731 --> 00:08:58.920
be a fair too.

131
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:04.250
There will be their social reformers and we'll be educating the ex slaves.
Um,

132
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:09.350
but they also went by a different name in American history and that is the name

133
00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.400
of the carpet bagger.

134
00:09:11.401 --> 00:09:16.090
And we can see a very vivid illustration of that.
Um,

135
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:21.140
the huge back that is more than the panties really is the defining feature of

136
00:09:21.481 --> 00:09:25.190
this person.
Um,
and there were mainly really contusions,
um,

137
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:30.210
about how much they will resent it in a pill spell itself.

138
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:35.270
So this one image of how doing good the claim to do good can actually benefit

139
00:09:35.911 --> 00:09:37.980
yourself.
Likewise,

140
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:43.010
the self groaning under the burden of the cover back goats actual burden right

141
00:09:45.541 --> 00:09:49.830
there.
Um,
and I'm not entirely clear about the logic of this regard.

142
00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:52.830
Should just try it out and email,
you know,

143
00:09:52.831 --> 00:09:56.490
email or just write a blog about this email if you can figure it out that you've

144
00:09:56.491 --> 00:10:01.460
set logic anyway.
I mean,
there's excitement there,
but it's complicated.
Um,
so,
um,

145
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:05.820
cartoons,
political cartoons can be really a great way to think about,
um,

146
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:06.241
you know,

147
00:10:06.241 --> 00:10:11.160
just pull it the goal history and social history and certainly a very important

148
00:10:11.161 --> 00:10:13.880
background to light in August.
Um,

149
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:18.570
but what we now see is the outcome of their joy.
And their burden is,

150
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:23.190
we know is still there as the doer.
Someone who was doing good.

151
00:10:23.191 --> 00:10:27.060
She is on the board of multiple charities.

152
00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:31.000
She gives them money.
Um,
she has a black lawyer,
basically,

153
00:10:31.001 --> 00:10:35.270
she spent her whole life,
um,
doing racial uplift,

154
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:40.080
working towards the welfare of the black population.
Um,

155
00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:44.470
and this is what happens to her,
uh,
at the end of that live.

156
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:49.300
Um,
but the way those partners telling the story is actually the tone of that is

157
00:10:49.301 --> 00:10:54.240
very different from the tone.
The just,
she was lying on the floor.

158
00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:58.820
Her head had been cut.
[inaudible] this is,
um,

159
00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:01.400
as is the custom and light in August.
Um,

160
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.470
but very dramatic episode is ran.

161
00:11:04.471 --> 00:11:09.471
The tours is retold who us by someone who was there but not a central player in

162
00:11:11.251 --> 00:11:15.810
the story.
So this whole discovery of Joanna burdens,
um,

163
00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:21.020
Barney was reported by baron bunch to hightower and Byron wasn't there to do the

164
00:11:21.451 --> 00:11:22.350
discovery either.

165
00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:26.430
He was reporting when a country man who's a total stranger and coming to town in

166
00:11:26.431 --> 00:11:29.380
a wagon with a total stranger.
Um,

167
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:33.900
being given this important functions with discovering Joanna burdens body.

168
00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:37.740
So this is this country man from nowhere,
um,
telling just to,

169
00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:41.780
I'm telling you about the event.
She was lying on the floor.

170
00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:47.180
Her head had been cut pretty near of a lady with the beginning of gray hair,

171
00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:48.361
the Madison,

172
00:11:48.361 --> 00:11:52.350
how he stood there and he could hear the fire and there was smoke in the room

173
00:11:52.351 --> 00:11:57.351
itself now like it had done a followed him in and how he was afraid to try the

174
00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:01.370
pick up and carry her out because her head,

175
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:02.740
my come clean off.

176
00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:08.700
So he ran back into the house and up the stairs again and into the room and Joe

177
00:12:08.721 --> 00:12:12.250
of the cover off the bed and grow her onto it like a sack of meal.

178
00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:17.720
And he said that what he was scared happened because the cover fell open as she

179
00:12:18.311 --> 00:12:22.750
was laying on the side facing one way and her head was turned Korean around.

180
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:27.940
Like she was looking behind her and he said that if she could have just done

181
00:12:27.941 --> 00:12:31.660
that when she was alive,
she might not have been doing it now.
Okay.

182
00:12:31.661 --> 00:12:34.570
Thought there's actually repeating himself.
Right?

183
00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:39.600
It's the same kind of construction that Lina use when she talks about herself

184
00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.780
climbing out of the window for the last time.

185
00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:46.930
It was a little difficult that time,

186
00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:51.310
but if it had been that difficult from the first time,

187
00:12:51.311 --> 00:12:54.040
she might not need to be doing it now.
Right?

188
00:12:54.041 --> 00:12:58.380
So it's exactly the same structure,
um,

189
00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:02.530
where there's where,
um,
is that even in Linda's case,
even though you know,

190
00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:06.670
it could have been seen as totally unfunny story is told in a funny way.

191
00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:10.480
Um,
and this episode is,

192
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:15.990
it's really hard to see how it could be funny in any fashion except for the

193
00:13:16.991 --> 00:13:20.650
weight.
Faulkner has chosen to tell the story.

194
00:13:20.651 --> 00:13:24.940
So this is something very deep in Faulkner,

195
00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:28.800
um,
that his temptation,
um,

196
00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:33.840
his compulsion is to tell a tragic story from a karmic point of view.

197
00:13:34.511 --> 00:13:39.430
And we can speculate about why this is such a pattern in him.

198
00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:40.953
Um,

199
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:45.670
but I think that he really doesn't want to give tragedy,

200
00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:50.890
um,
the entirety of the field.
You know,
if we can think of the narrative feel,

201
00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:55.210
um,
as either full occupancy or have occupancy,

202
00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:00.500
tragedy is granted no more than half occupancy of the narrative feel at any

203
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:07.220
given moment.
Um,
and maybe it's not even half,
maybe it's here,

204
00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:10.990
it seems to be less than half.
Um,
so here's the hundred million,
you know,

205
00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:14.800
worrying about all the things that one really shouldn't be worrying about when

206
00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:18.300
was discovering a dead body.
Um,
and the,

207
00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:22.530
the can very contrived plot detail that too,

208
00:14:22.531 --> 00:14:26.410
and his birth and his head is turned around.

209
00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.090
So as she's looking back with,
and it's one of those,

210
00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:33.890
turns out that there's actually a very,
um,
vulnerable,
uh,

211
00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:38.970
genealogy to that particular configuration of that human body or human health in

212
00:14:40.781 --> 00:14:42.370
relation to the rest of the body.

213
00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:47.680
It turns out that the epic is coming into play as well because,

214
00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:50.150
um,
in a divine comedy Canto,

215
00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:54.470
Tony is very famous episode of,
um,
Dante and Virgil,

216
00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:58.620
I'm going to hell and you know,
seeing all these people and how,
uh,

217
00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:03.640
being punished and Don Hayes way your punishment is by the logic of Contra Paso

218
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:09.620
that the punishment is the repetition of your crime.
So this is what he sees.

219
00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:13.550
Um,
the whole group people that has turned around as I inclined,

220
00:15:13.551 --> 00:15:14.650
my head's still more.

221
00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:20.380
I saw that each amazingly appear contorted between the Chin and where the chest

222
00:15:22.781 --> 00:15:23.614
begins.

223
00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:29.080
They had the faces twisted to what the hunches and found it necessary to walk

224
00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:35.540
with because they could not see ahead of them.
And um,

225
00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:38.510
this is an illustration.
Um,

226
00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:43.660
Flaxman illustration of the all these people in health care has turned

227
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:49.280
backwards.
And the reason that they upon urge in this particular way,
um,

228
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:54.370
is that in life there was soothsayers they claim to foreseeing the future.

229
00:15:55.220 --> 00:16:00.220
And of course in Dante is Cosmo's this very quite severe Christian Cosmo's,

230
00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:05.480
uh,
like the,
the,
the,
the Greek tradition.

231
00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:10.070
Human beings are not really supposed to know anything about the future for

232
00:16:10.071 --> 00:16:13.910
knowledge is now the privilege that human beings can claim.

233
00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:17.750
So as a consequence of claiming for knowledge for the future,

234
00:16:17.751 --> 00:16:21.850
these people were punished.
And how by having the has turned back was,

235
00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.820
um,
and we can also think of Faulkner in many ways.

236
00:16:25.821 --> 00:16:29.600
Thinking of this as a fifth punishment for social reformers,

237
00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:34.370
social reformers also claimed to have some kind of privilege relation to the

238
00:16:34.371 --> 00:16:39.110
future and they're reforming the present,
you know,
quite often,
uh,

239
00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:42.980
because they have this vision about the future that they want the president to

240
00:16:42.981 --> 00:16:46.460
approximate the vision of the future that they can sleep.
So,
um,

241
00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:51.610
maybe that is the connection between Joanna and these ancient soothsayers.

242
00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:57.440
Um,
but the,
the,
so there's the kind of a thematic connection,

243
00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:02.420
but the tonal connection is,
is,
is different.

244
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:06.980
Um,
if we think about Dante based,
um,

245
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:13.460
incident,
um,
in a divine comedy,
um,
there's just,

246
00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:18.960
there's no humor in it is a terrible sight to see all the table with a has

247
00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:21.920
turned back was,
and likewise in this representation,

248
00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:26.030
there's nothing funny about this.
It could have been done in the funny fashion,

249
00:17:26.031 --> 00:17:28.850
but it's never done in a funny fashion.

250
00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:33.920
Whereas Faulkner's representation of Joe and there's definitely comic.

251
00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:39.320
Um,
so it seems that every time,
anytime Faulkner in books,

252
00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:41.320
uh,
kind of,
uh,

253
00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:46.420
an analogy from a prior tax is always rewriting the tabs and changing,

254
00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:52.320
especially the tone of that episode.
Um,

255
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:57.210
but so from Joanna or we get kind of complicated picture,

256
00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:00.720
um,
of the malice of neighbors,
um,

257
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:03.990
well I mean actually she's not killed by her neighbors as well find out.

258
00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:08.940
So even though the neighbors are kind of rejoicing and having a lot of fun over

259
00:18:08.941 --> 00:18:12.370
the fact that she's killed the houses burning down,
um,

260
00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:14.430
even though they are enjoying it,

261
00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:18.150
they actually not the instruments for her killing.

262
00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:20.520
So that's important to remember.
Um,

263
00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:25.580
and also that Faulkner for some reason chooses to approach it from a very odd

264
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:31.070
angle so that it's not exactly sympathy there thought leader is trying to

265
00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:34.410
generate from the reader.
We can try that.
We should ask,
you know,

266
00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:38.410
what kind of reader's response responses he's,
he's,
he,

267
00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:40.650
he's cultivating in that particular episode,

268
00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:44.230
but it's definitely now sympathy for Joanna.
Um,

269
00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:49.280
so that puts us in a very peculiar relation as well because in some sense we are

270
00:18:50.431 --> 00:18:53.000
the neighbors to Joanna,
right.

271
00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:58.040
We are just like those neighbors who have some fun at her expands with the

272
00:18:59.251 --> 00:19:04.080
readers are also having some fun at the expense.
So that is the,
the,

273
00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:07.680
the kind of narrative that fault is,
is giving us,
um,

274
00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:12.140
but to move on to the next figure who also,
um,

275
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:14.310
and that's a kind of dance,

276
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:18.360
a permutation of the various meanings of neighbor.

277
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:20.040
And this was an actually,

278
00:19:20.041 --> 00:19:25.041
it's given more space in terms of this full development of the various

279
00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:30.680
incarnations of the concept of neighbor.
Um,

280
00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:33.620
so this is the reference hightower who,
um,

281
00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:37.950
came to town and then all of a sudden he loses his,
his,
um,

282
00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:41.790
he loses his job as a minister.
Um,
and um,

283
00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:45.920
then rumors not going around and about his relation with blacks as well.
Um,

284
00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:50.130
and this is what happens to him one night because that evening,

285
00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:52.410
some man not matched,

286
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:57.470
either tilt the knee room and this is the cook took the Negro man how and

287
00:19:58.520 --> 00:19:59.353
Winton.

288
00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:04.790
And when hired how wake the next morning he studied window was broken and on the

289
00:20:05.971 --> 00:20:09.210
floor lay a break with no tie to it,

290
00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:13.980
commanding him to get out of town by sunset inside of the KKK.

291
00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.630
And he did not go.

292
00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:21.170
And on the second morning a man found him in the woods about a mile from town.

293
00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:27.030
He had been tie to a tree and beaten unconscious.

294
00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:30.060
So this is exactly the same people,

295
00:20:30.061 --> 00:20:33.100
the same people who,
um,

296
00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:39.230
were kind to,
uh,
Lina public.
We're on Clensman.

297
00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:41.630
Um,
you know,
it quite a common,
um,
is,

298
00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:46.170
is it has a very deep roots actually in some southern communities.
Um,

299
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:51.230
and lots of were class when that you might not think would be plans when new

300
00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:56.590
studies also have shown that actually lots of women were Klansmen that as well.

301
00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:02.080
Um,
so,
um,
we,
we just don't know who,
uh,

302
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:05.860
within,
in this case was just the man.
But what is interesting,
they actually,

303
00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:08.180
two interesting facts,
um,

304
00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:11.740
about this one is that the man,

305
00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:16.390
I'm not mass.
I think that that says a lot that actually,

306
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:21.790
um,
in,
in any kind of clan action,
um,
the people would the hood,

307
00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:25.420
so you don't actually see the faces,
but these,

308
00:21:25.421 --> 00:21:29.680
this variation on that,
this man are not who did,
they're not mass.

309
00:21:29.681 --> 00:21:33.850
So that's very fun.
They are revealing the identity fully to hightower.

310
00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:35.170
Um,

311
00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:40.170
and then the other detail is that obviously they want hide how to leave town and

312
00:21:41.681 --> 00:21:46.450
he does not go,
even though his billing unconscious,

313
00:21:46.451 --> 00:21:48.130
he still refuses to leave.

314
00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:53.430
So these two are the very important variation to the customer's story about Klan

315
00:21:54.701 --> 00:21:55.420
violence.

316
00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:59.380
And we'll see what comes from that that follows both giving us a kind of very

317
00:21:59.381 --> 00:22:01.540
recognizable southern history,
um,

318
00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:06.280
but also is giving us a very important variation on that southern history.

319
00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:09.670
So let's look at fault.
Follow the calendar.

320
00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:11.680
Permutation of the mallows are strangers.

321
00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.800
He refused to tell who had done it.

322
00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:20.160
The town knew that that was wrong and some of the men came to him and try again

323
00:22:20.591 --> 00:22:23.470
to persuade him to leave Jefferson for his own good,

324
00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:28.240
telling him that next time they might kill him.
But he refused to leave.

325
00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.480
He went not even talk about the beating,

326
00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:35.560
even when they offer to prosecute the man who had done it,

327
00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:40.960
but he would do needle,
he would need a towel nor depart.

328
00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:46.650
And then all of a sudden the whole thing's theme to blow away like an evil when

329
00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:52.390
it was as though the time realize at last the he would be a part of his life

330
00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:57.370
until he died and that they might as well they come reconcile.

331
00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:02.730
So this is the crucial difference story that Faulkner is taling about southern

332
00:23:04.631 --> 00:23:09.631
history is that the malice of your neighbors is the starting point.

333
00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:13.910
It is not the end point.
Um,

334
00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:18.760
it would be too easy or too much of a cliche to say that these people are just

335
00:23:18.761 --> 00:23:22.830
better at it.
Um,
and they're going to post the Q.

336
00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:26.470
Anyone who was not on the same line,
it will be much too simple to say that.

337
00:23:26.471 --> 00:23:30.520
So this is the very important variations that men are not mass.
They fully,

338
00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:35.580
they let the put it within high tops powered to report on them and the

339
00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:40.450
timeliness in fact ran into prosecute those men.
Um,

340
00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:43.090
so in fact the legal,
you know,

341
00:23:43.091 --> 00:23:46.640
there's the legal action it's about to get started.
Um,

342
00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:49.160
and certainly those actionable violence,

343
00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:52.340
but just as the,

344
00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:57.460
those people who who will be eating high tower put within his power to report on

345
00:23:59.841 --> 00:24:00.674
him,

346
00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:05.890
he refuses to use that power that they have put into his hands.

347
00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:11.450
Right?
So this is a strange kind of symmetry.
This is the,

348
00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:14.300
for me,
this is the most,
um,

349
00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:19.600
interesting and compelling kind of reciprocity that you put yourselves in the

350
00:24:21.351 --> 00:24:26.351
power of someone that you hate and you don't use the power,

351
00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:32.170
the dose whom you hate or those who hate you have put bested in your hands.

352
00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:37.310
Um,
is very given the fact that there's so much violence going on,

353
00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:42.080
there's actually an incredibly delicate ethical gesture,
um,

354
00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:46.910
on both the cost.
And I would say that this is,
um,
you know,
I don't know how,

355
00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:50.810
I mean maybe this is two years Utopian,
I'm just reporting to you.

356
00:24:50.811 --> 00:24:53.460
This is what will I think probably is doing,
um,

357
00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:57.710
that this is the way that he would like to tell the story in this,
this,

358
00:24:57.711 --> 00:25:01.040
the way that he hopes that human beings would conduct themselves under those

359
00:25:01.041 --> 00:25:01.730
circumstances.

360
00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:05.570
I should also point out that actually there's a in there in the book that I

361
00:25:05.571 --> 00:25:07.420
mentioned earlier,
Labor,
um,

362
00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:12.050
there's actually a strong argument in favor of ethical violence.

363
00:25:12.051 --> 00:25:15.830
There's sometimes we just can help to environments to someone,
um,

364
00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:18.950
but how to be ethical about that.
So for me,

365
00:25:18.951 --> 00:25:23.630
this actually is an instance of ethical,
I mean qualified,
highly qualified,

366
00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:26.630
but nonetheless ethical violence.
Um,

367
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:31.100
and I think it's because of that because there's actually,

368
00:25:31.101 --> 00:25:33.130
this is violence within limits.
Um,

369
00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:38.120
it is wireless that they has a degree of lawfulness to it in the sense that the

370
00:25:38.121 --> 00:25:42.650
law is going to pros prosecuted them and those perpetrators actually have put

371
00:25:42.651 --> 00:25:47.540
themselves under the jurisdiction of the law.
Um,

372
00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:52.370
there's a degree of lawfulness to that kind of violence is because of that,

373
00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:57.350
that I think that height,
how actually has this to say about his neighbors.

374
00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.340
Hightower said they are good people.

375
00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:04.820
They must believe what they must believe,

376
00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:09.850
especially as it was I who was one who was at one time,

377
00:26:10.131 --> 00:26:13.850
both master and servant of the believing.

378
00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:19.240
And so it is not for me to outrage the believing no for baron bunch to say that

379
00:26:20.781 --> 00:26:25.781
they arrived because all that NMN can hope for is to be permitted to live

380
00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:29.060
quietly among his fellows.

381
00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:34.390
So this is one kind of idea is that you can really change the way people,

382
00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:39.230
what people believe about you.
You know,
they have,

383
00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:42.500
they can have all kinds of wrong believes about you.

384
00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:45.330
There's no way you can change those beliefs.

385
00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:49.500
There's no way you can change how some other people feel about you.

386
00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:52.980
Feeling is not something that you can dictate.
And other people,

387
00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:56.100
if they haven't or hate you,
there's nothing you can do about that.

388
00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:58.370
So that is a very um,

389
00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:03.440
tough minded evaluation of the primacy of certain kinds of sentiment or not

390
00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:04.730
really.

391
00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:09.730
They that do not make for harmonious relations among human beings and hatred is

392
00:27:09.991 --> 00:27:13.870
a very powerful reality for Faulkner.
So,
you know,

393
00:27:13.871 --> 00:27:15.060
you just have to live with that,

394
00:27:15.061 --> 00:27:17.760
but some people just don't like you all that much.
Um,

395
00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:22.880
and given the fact that how can you still manage to live quietly and peacefully

396
00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:28.110
among people who don't like you are that much.

397
00:27:28.111 --> 00:27:30.390
That is the ethical challenge for hotel.

398
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:35.870
So all of this suggests that for him for now at this moment and pick 75 tower,

399
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.600
um,

400
00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:44.600
is the ways of a certain kind of ethical norm and Faulkner and it's not

401
00:27:46.471 --> 00:27:48.560
surprising that his name is Hai towel,
you know,

402
00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:52.350
it's almost kind of to a very elevated,
very high calm,

403
00:27:52.351 --> 00:27:56.790
maybe impossibly high kind of ethical norm.
Very few of us actually,

404
00:27:56.791 --> 00:28:01.500
it can behave as he does at this moment.
Um,

405
00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:06.530
but I think that we should also be aware that hide her actually doesn't occupy

406
00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:11.850
that Moro height of the time.

407
00:28:11.851 --> 00:28:16.851
Just as the narrative feel is quite often a few of have often there nothing can

408
00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.210
fully occupied that feel.

409
00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:26.630
Moral elevation is also a place where you can have full command all the time.

410
00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:33.410
So this is a sudden different image of hightower from the town's point of view.

411
00:28:34.441 --> 00:28:38.050
People who don't like him all that much,
what they think about how to tackle,

412
00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:42.410
but the towels that the high tower that if hightower,

413
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:44.800
and this is not talking about his black cook anymore,

414
00:28:44.801 --> 00:28:46.780
we're not talking about the violence.
Uh,

415
00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:50.010
we're talking about something else that is also quite two other things about

416
00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:53.550
hotel.
One is that he seems completely fixated on the civil war.

417
00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:57.270
He seems completely fixated on his grandfather's death during the civil war,

418
00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:01.020
the hoses galloping.
That is the reality for him.
And the other,

419
00:29:01.021 --> 00:29:02.730
his wife is going crazy,
um,

420
00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:06.300
in that marriage and he doesn't seem to be able to do anything about it.

421
00:29:06.301 --> 00:29:11.301
So this is the town's commentary on those two other aspects of high towers live.

422
00:29:11.881 --> 00:29:16.160
And you can see why he doesn't have full command of the,
you know,

423
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:20.430
ethical elevation that we've just seen him in.
Um,

424
00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:25.640
but the town said that if hightower had just been a more dependable kind of men,

425
00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:32.270
the condom man and minister should be instead of being born about 30 years after

426
00:29:32.401 --> 00:29:37.320
the only day he seemed to have ever lived in the day when his grandfather was

427
00:29:37.321 --> 00:29:42.100
shot from the galloping horse,
should have been all to the wife,

428
00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:43.630
but he was not.

429
00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:49.140
And the neighbor is with hero weeping in the parsonage in the afternoons or late

430
00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:56.610
at night and the neighbors knowing that the husband would not know what to do

431
00:29:57.431 --> 00:30:00.460
about it because he did not know what was wrong.

432
00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:05.520
So all of a sudden the neighbors have been transformed from the perpetrators

433
00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:11.010
perpetrators of violence to an independent voice of Judgment on high tower and

434
00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:16.080
on the marriage.
Um,

435
00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:20.980
they've functioning more like a great chorus in the sense that they have some

436
00:30:20.981 --> 00:30:25.981
knowledge about the marriage that is deny to hide how himself.

437
00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:28.240
Um,

438
00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:33.240
and so we should not forget for a minute then a man who has so much such a

439
00:30:33.671 --> 00:30:38.671
delicate ethical understanding of a southern kind of situation,

440
00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:44.910
having to do with violence that is done to himself can be completely blind.

441
00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:47.530
Um,
and,

442
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:51.610
and now the situation when it would have been good for him to have been just a

443
00:30:51.611 --> 00:30:56.260
little more sensitive,
right?
So there's an Oh,
lack of sensitivity,
um,

444
00:30:56.350 --> 00:31:01.350
in high tower that qualifies his claim to that ethical height that would say no,

445
00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:05.310
it doesn't,
it's a totally different issue.
It doesn't take away from the,

446
00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:08.860
the beading doesn't take away from the clan action,

447
00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:13.660
but it does suggest that high tower is a divided figured.
Um,

448
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:16.450
and he doesn't speak for Faulkner all the time.

449
00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:21.160
That Foglight is actually using his neighbors sometimes to pass judgment on him

450
00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:24.820
just as he is a dispensive judgment on others.
Um,

451
00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:29.110
so this is the neighbors in a different light and,
but there's yet another twist.

452
00:31:29.111 --> 00:31:32.230
So fun.
It doesn't stop.
I mean this is a constant,
um,

453
00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:34.620
switching back and forth,
um,

454
00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:39.100
the swing of the pendulum from the right being on the Labor side too,
right?

455
00:31:39.101 --> 00:31:42.180
Being on hightower aside,
injury being done to hotel.

456
00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.710
So this is neighbors and um,

457
00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:49.560
yet another light within two days,
this is a little bit later,

458
00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:54.250
the hightower was trying to deliver a black baby,
baby dies.
Um,

459
00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:58.030
and within two days,
rumors were going around town.

460
00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:03.070
Within two days there were those who said the child was high towers and that he

461
00:32:03.071 --> 00:32:05.230
had let her die deliberately.

462
00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:10.360
But Byron believe that even the ones who said this did not believe it.

463
00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:15.840
He believed that the town had had the habit of saying things about the disgrace

464
00:32:16.031 --> 00:32:19.030
minster,
which they did not believe themselves.

465
00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:24.330
So this is yet another interesting portrait of how people behave as a

466
00:32:26.201 --> 00:32:29.620
collectivity.
That as a collectivity,

467
00:32:29.621 --> 00:32:34.621
we tend to say things that we do not actually ourselves individually believe it.

468
00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:41.210
This is the nature quite often,
um,
of rumors of,
you know,

469
00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:44.310
uh,
just kind of a standardized,
uh,

470
00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:47.440
statements about certain situation,
um,

471
00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:49.550
that you just repeat a certain line.

472
00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:54.190
This is the nature of align that is fair to all of us and that we would mount

473
00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:58.400
without thinking about it.
Um,
and all of us do it,
you know,
is not just,

474
00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:03.320
it is not just people living in a small town always tend to say some things that

475
00:33:03.321 --> 00:33:07.320
we're having nationally,
personally thought about.
Um,
including damage,

476
00:33:07.321 --> 00:33:12.321
damaging things that we can say about someone like having a child and allowing

477
00:33:12.621 --> 00:33:17.200
the child that,
so this is the nature of rumor and barons insight.
Um,

478
00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:22.300
and he knows these people very well is that in one sense it is speech.

479
00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:28.660
That's themes who through that actually doesn't have personal malice in it.

480
00:33:29.101 --> 00:33:34.101
So we have to be very careful to distinguish than hurtful speech can certainly

481
00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:40.660
inflict injury on the person that that speech is about.

482
00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:42.470
It can inflict injury,

483
00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:48.070
but something can inflate injury without having a lot of personal malice in it.

484
00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:53.930
And that is the crucial distinction that Byron was us to make.

485
00:33:56.360 --> 00:34:00.680
So we can see that constantly things are switching back and forth.
Right?

486
00:34:00.681 --> 00:34:03.590
So we've been talking about,
this is,
uh,
Tuesday,
you know,

487
00:34:03.591 --> 00:34:08.450
the protagonists and supporting has constant switch,
background,
foreground,

488
00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:10.520
dark and light light in August dark.

489
00:34:10.521 --> 00:34:14.780
How's the other title for the novel kind and unkind neighbors,

490
00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:17.780
dramatic narrative versus in dramatic narrative.

491
00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:22.810
But the of all this is coming to a head in the switch between Lena Grove and

492
00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:29.180
Joel Christmas.
And this is a very interesting,

493
00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:33.890
uh,
narrative innovation on the part of the pile of partner.

494
00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:34.730
Um,

495
00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:39.730
we've seen in the sound of the fury that it is a four section novel,

496
00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:44.210
right?
And as I lay dying many,
many,

497
00:34:44.211 --> 00:34:48.950
too many to count sections,
complete a split into tiny low narratives.

498
00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:53.290
Um,
and in this,
uh,
novel,
um,

499
00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:57.890
it's really to the story of two people who are strangers to each other.
Um,

500
00:34:57.980 --> 00:34:58.281
you know,

501
00:34:58.281 --> 00:35:02.540
it's a really huge challenge how you could tell a story about two people who

502
00:35:02.541 --> 00:35:05.270
have no connection to each other,
uh,

503
00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:07.970
but make the two stories one novel.

504
00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:11.500
So we'll see how that is played out in weather.

505
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:15.320
Faulkner is completely successful in mechanic.
Those two,
um,

506
00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:19.560
turning these two into a single story.
Uh,

507
00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:23.660
but today we'll look at part of what he's trying to do,
I think,

508
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:27.110
and look at the contrasting functions,
um,

509
00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:30.470
of being a growth and Joe Christmas and there's novel.
Um,

510
00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:35.390
obviously we know that one is a positive catalyst for the community.

511
00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:39.690
Um,
are the good about our community come out.
Uh,

512
00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:45.530
when we see Lena Rove in action and all the bad things about Joe Christmas,

513
00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:51.270
about the community come out when we see,
uh,
Joe Christmases podocytes are,

514
00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:54.300
one's a positive,
Carlos the and negative calories,

515
00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:57.750
but where there's artists don't you and all this seems to be pushing them to be

516
00:35:57.751 --> 00:35:59.640
on opposite and,
uh,

517
00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:04.280
of the narratives spectrum quite often partner also,
ah,

518
00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:07.740
contrives to make them meet as well.

519
00:36:07.741 --> 00:36:10.710
So it's a very interesting and kinship outweighed between the two of them,

520
00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.480
even though they seem so different.

521
00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:16.980
So we'll talk about the linguistic can share and also the fact that both of them

522
00:36:16.981 --> 00:36:21.120
seem to be passive receptacles for when is coming to them.

523
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:24.690
So first,
uh,
when,
uh,
I think you know this,

524
00:36:24.691 --> 00:36:28.200
but just one repeated from Lena,
this is the story.

525
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:33.210
Folks have been kind of been right time.
It is a very monotonous storage.

526
00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:33.970
This is,

527
00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:38.970
and in that sense she's not a very great character to another completely helpful

528
00:36:39.331 --> 00:36:42.930
character to partner because she only knows one thing.
Um,

529
00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:46.440
and the story never changes.
Um,

530
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:51.270
so it's,
it,
he really has two interviews,

531
00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:54.450
the kind of a counterpoint to Lena,
um,

532
00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:59.690
whose very name or really precipitate a negative response from the people who

533
00:37:02.341 --> 00:37:05.940
are finding out I'm here learning about his name for the first time.

534
00:37:05.941 --> 00:37:09.060
So there's two of form.
And um,
his hat,

535
00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:12.490
there's the Joe Christmas was just getting a job from his people.

536
00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:16.530
His name is Juan ones that Christmas you see a foreigner.

537
00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:20.940
Did you ever hear of a white man named Christmas performance that I've never

538
00:37:20.941 --> 00:37:24.180
heard of.
Nobody at our name it,
the other one set.

539
00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:28.980
So just to have the name Christmas and you know,

540
00:37:29.370 --> 00:37:32.550
I can't really think of a name that is less neutral,

541
00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:36.850
less innocuous than the name Christmas.
Um,

542
00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:41.880
but even for us,
I think to hear someone call Christmas,
you know,

543
00:37:41.881 --> 00:37:44.760
there'll be kind of a strange response from those of us.
And sure enough,

544
00:37:44.761 --> 00:37:49.290
there's a strange response from these two people.
Um,

545
00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:51.070
so in realize that,

546
00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:55.590
that in fact that we're not entirely immune from that.
Um,
you know,

547
00:37:56.190 --> 00:38:01.190
it's not as though the world of farmer is creating this kind of slightly apart

548
00:38:02.131 --> 00:38:05.770
from our world anyways.
We of that well,
um,

549
00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:10.350
but we're certainly seeing an extreme reaction,
uh,
from these two people.

550
00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:11.730
All of a sudden it becomes,

551
00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:14.970
nobody here ever thought of him as being a foreign and something has got to be

552
00:38:14.971 --> 00:38:18.600
four.
They do worse than that in foreigners.
Don't have a name like Christmas.

553
00:38:18.601 --> 00:38:22.110
So maybe he's nonhuman.
Um,
not quite that,

554
00:38:22.111 --> 00:38:26.160
but then he suddenly is in a unclassifiable,
uh,

555
00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:30.750
but negatively unclassifiable category.

556
00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:31.950
Um,

557
00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:36.950
so less and the wrestlers story based on the consequences in many ways of having

558
00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:41.320
a name like Christmas.
Um,

559
00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:45.850
but for now I want to actually to not,
not to go there yet,

560
00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:46.870
but to,
um,

561
00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:52.090
talk about a very strange kind of kinship,
um,

562
00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:57.080
betrayed Lena and Joe who otherwise seem so different,
um,

563
00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:02.260
is a completely counter intuitive kinship like thing is also white deliberate.

564
00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:07.500
So let's just go back to this passage that we've talked about last time about

565
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:11.560
leanness,
peaceful journey behind her.
The four weeks,

566
00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:15.670
the evocation of far is a peaceful corridor,

567
00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:21.030
pays with unflagging and 12 who faith and people with Kai and nameless faces and

568
00:39:23.411 --> 00:39:27.460
voices is the nature of um,
lean as journey.

569
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:29.080
And oddly enough,

570
00:39:29.081 --> 00:39:33.220
the same kind of language is used again,

571
00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:38.980
a very different moment in the story for Joe Christmas when it's actually just

572
00:39:39.161 --> 00:39:41.980
about ready to do the killing.

573
00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:46.480
Maybe I've done it,
maybe I've already done it.

574
00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:51.220
He thought maybe it is no longer now waiting to be done.

575
00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:56.880
It seemed to him to hear cause theory Yellow Day opening peacefully on before

576
00:39:58.091 --> 00:39:58.870
him,

577
00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:03.870
like a corridor and arrest into a still carers curo without urgency.

578
00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:08.380
It's seemed to him that as he sat there,

579
00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:13.740
the Yellow Day contemplated him droughts away like a prong and Solomon yellow

580
00:40:15.371 --> 00:40:16.060
cab,

581
00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:20.980
he will not move apparently arrested and how the Imobile by single word,

582
00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:26.280
which had perhaps not yet impacted is holy and suspended in quiet and Sunday

583
00:40:27.771 --> 00:40:28.450
space.

584
00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:33.450
So that hanging motionless and without physical weight seem to wash the slow

585
00:40:34.031 --> 00:40:37.890
flowing of time.
Believe him,
it is exactly one color.

586
00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:42.100
Just put Lena right in there and they were better description of what journey.

587
00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:43.060
Um,

588
00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:48.060
so as I hope that it makes no sense to you who farm they would want to use this,

589
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:53.820
um,
for Joe Christmas right before the lower the violence.
Um,

590
00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:57.700
I think that is,
is it is,
um,

591
00:40:58.050 --> 00:41:02.150
is is something that cries out to be interpreted as reader.
You know,

592
00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:05.420
why there should be the doer duplication,
um,

593
00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:10.700
of the ones that are appropriate language for Lena into this completely

594
00:41:11.111 --> 00:41:16.040
inappropriate and counter to counter intuitive contacts.
Um,

595
00:41:16.090 --> 00:41:19.320
but all we can say is that this is quite heavy handed,

596
00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:24.280
a attempt on [inaudible] part to generate a linguistic kinship between the two

597
00:41:24.281 --> 00:41:25.220
of them.
Um,

598
00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:29.720
let's look at another incidence and if we see a little bit,
um,

599
00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:34.830
in the use of Germans in talking about this moment of impending instant pen

600
00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:40.010
violence when he was house expanded but very peaceful.
Um,

601
00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:44.690
and so this is the,
the use of Germans.
And we've seen that in Lena as well,

602
00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:48.320
that fall within my hearing before I seeing,

603
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:53.710
I will be writing within the hearing of Lucas Bush before he seen we're here the

604
00:41:53.901 --> 00:41:56.660
wagon,
but he will know so that we won who they are,

605
00:41:56.661 --> 00:42:01.400
this hearing before is seen and then he will see me and he will be excited.

606
00:42:01.401 --> 00:42:06.230
And so that we are too within the scene before he is remembering completely

607
00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:09.830
highly conspicuous use of the journey.
Um,

608
00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:14.920
and this also a Paolo highly conspicuous use of the journal for Joel Christmas.

609
00:42:15.291 --> 00:42:20.291
And knowing not waving remembers a thousand savage and on the streets the same

610
00:42:21.171 --> 00:42:26.171
use German but in a completely different context and completely different thing

611
00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:28.970
matters.
Um,

612
00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:34.060
so we really have to think low more about why it is even though the two of them

613
00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:39.760
standing polar opposites that father nonetheless sees and is emphatic about the

614
00:42:42.231 --> 00:42:45.100
cancer between the two of them.
So,
um,

615
00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:49.520
maybe one way to think about this,
um,
is to once again in this to,

616
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:51.920
um,
think about,
um,

617
00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:56.840
the relation between an individual and a collectivity or at least various

618
00:42:56.841 --> 00:43:00.100
representatives of that collectivity.
Um,

619
00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:02.680
and we've Leanor we've seen that,
um,

620
00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:07.720
she really is a passive receptacles for all the southern hospitality and this

621
00:43:08.181 --> 00:43:09.750
coming to her.
Um,

622
00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:14.360
and maybe that's why she's really not that interesting on her own,

623
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:19.390
that it really takes action from other people too vast her narrative with any

624
00:43:20.781 --> 00:43:22.820
kind of action that are left to their own devices.

625
00:43:22.821 --> 00:43:25.550
There will be no story to tell really.
Um,

626
00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:30.640
and so she's the passive receptacle in the sense that she's really the narrative

627
00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:36.520
device by which a community gets to tell a story by which the action of a

628
00:43:37.641 --> 00:43:42.641
community guests dramatize and gets register within a campus of a single

629
00:43:43.461 --> 00:43:44.294
individual.

630
00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:50.020
And I would say that that is also the narrative function of Joe Christmas as

631
00:43:50.481 --> 00:43:52.520
well.
That in many ways,

632
00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:56.320
even though he's probably more psychologically complex,
um,

633
00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:58.790
they're meaner and it will be interested in and think about what kind of

634
00:43:58.791 --> 00:44:03.620
psychology has,
in spite of the complexity of his psychology,

635
00:44:03.621 --> 00:44:08.621
he has the similar narrative function in the sense that he is the vehicle by

636
00:44:12.321 --> 00:44:14.850
which somebody else's actions.

637
00:44:14.851 --> 00:44:18.340
Some of the analysis drama gets registers.

638
00:44:18.350 --> 00:44:23.350
So he is the template on which someone else writes a dramatic narrative.

639
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:26.060
Um,
so this is his,

640
00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:32.010
the continuation of that peaceful moment when he's about to do the killing.

641
00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:37.490
He just sat there not moving until after awhile he heard the clock two miles

642
00:44:38.761 --> 00:44:43.620
away,
strike 12.
Then he rose and move to what?
The house.

643
00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:44.970
He didn't go fast.

644
00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:49.110
He didn't even think even then something is going to happen.

645
00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:52.260
Something is going to happen to me.

646
00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:56.880
Is that some typical construction,
not I'm going to do something,

647
00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:59.190
but something is going to happen to me.

648
00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:03.030
So that I will actually kills on what is that,

649
00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:08.150
that bizarre of transformation of what would it mean for Asian Miller of the

650
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:11.760
sentence.
Um,
so this is the,

651
00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:14.610
even the most dramatic action that he's,

652
00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:20.060
that he's responsible for his cast as something that's happening to him without

653
00:45:21.721 --> 00:45:24.420
his volition almost.
Um,

654
00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:29.510
and we're seeing that this is actually the logical combination of a pattern that

655
00:45:30.301 --> 00:45:35.040
has been the dominant Palin all through his life.

656
00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:39.440
So this goes back,
this moment goes back to when he was a kid,
um,

657
00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:43.710
when he was watching,
when he was hiding in the getting toothpaste,
um,

658
00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:48.210
in the closet and the Dietitian and getting sick from the toothpaste,

659
00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:52.230
and then witnessing this completely bewildering thing that is going on between

660
00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:54.980
the Dietitian and the man who was in the room.
Um,

661
00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:57.300
and then all of a sudden he throws up in the Dietitian,

662
00:45:57.301 --> 00:45:59.580
realizes that there's someone hiding in her closet.

663
00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:03.690
So this is what happens when she's furious to know that you and the other man

664
00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:07.890
that they,
the two of them are not alone in the room.
When the curtain flat back,

665
00:46:07.891 --> 00:46:12.000
he did not look up when hands strapped him violently.

666
00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:16.740
I would love to vomit.
He did not resist.
He hung from the hands.

667
00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:18.960
Them looking with slack,

668
00:46:18.961 --> 00:46:22.800
jawed and glassy idiocy into a face,

669
00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:27.720
no longer smooth pain.
Goodway surrounded now by wild and disheveled hair,

670
00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:31.710
who Smoove bands ones made him think of candy.
Eulo Rad.

671
00:46:32.070 --> 00:46:37.070
The thin theories voice has to rad spine on a little negative acid.

672
00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:41.880
Um,
so it's not been,

673
00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:45.450
Joe has not really been in this orphanage with all this is happening.

674
00:46:45.451 --> 00:46:48.140
He said he has not been,
uh,
nobody has up.

675
00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:51.840
I mean if few of the suspected that something maybe low are the bias racial

676
00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:55.110
composition,
uh,
but nobody actually up to this point,

677
00:46:55.400 --> 00:47:00.000
at least nobody from the administration has called him,
um,
black.
Um,

678
00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:02.160
and this at this moment,
uh,

679
00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:05.790
when he is the unwilling involuntary,

680
00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:10.880
unintentional and weighing witness to this scene that is unfolding and the

681
00:47:12.751 --> 00:47:17.751
Dietitians room that that adjective is thrown at him and everything about the

682
00:47:19.591 --> 00:47:24.360
description is that he's hanging from his hanging from the hands.
The dietitian,

683
00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:29.290
um,
he's witnessing a phase that is completely transformed his,

684
00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:31.640
the recipient of that,
his,
uh,

685
00:47:31.650 --> 00:47:36.430
is coming at him almost complete passive at a,
on his side.

686
00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:41.550
So that he really is the template on which the dietician is writing her own

687
00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:45.310
theory and her own story.
One more example,

688
00:47:45.590 --> 00:47:50.260
and this is his relation to his,
um,
to his adoptive father,

689
00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:54.670
uh,
vacation.
Um,
we have various ways to pronounce that name.

690
00:47:54.671 --> 00:47:58.410
I'm just going to bring on as a vacation.
You can finance it anyways you want.
Um,

691
00:47:58.450 --> 00:48:02.200
then the boys do in his trousers collapsed about his feet,

692
00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:04.870
his legs reviewed.
We need his wreath.

693
00:48:04.871 --> 00:48:09.640
Should his stewards light and erect.
When the strap fell,

694
00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:14.440
hit enough flinch,
no quiver passed over his face.

695
00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:19.980
He was looking straight ahead with the rep calm expression like a mum in the

696
00:48:22.091 --> 00:48:23.980
picture.
So once again,

697
00:48:23.981 --> 00:48:28.510
this is not the kind of uncontrolled violence and is coming from the dietician,

698
00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:32.230
but the very disciplined violence,
um,

699
00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:37.090
that is coming from his own,
uh,
foster father that the father,

700
00:48:37.650 --> 00:48:40.330
um,
but no matter what kind of violence,

701
00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:43.810
it can be either out of control or are they totally control.

702
00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:47.810
He is just there like a saint,
like a mum,
uh,

703
00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:50.500
just totally calm,
um,

704
00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:53.170
and seemingly untouched by that violence.

705
00:48:53.170 --> 00:48:57.280
And that's part of the interesting fact about,
um,
about,

706
00:48:57.340 --> 00:49:01.430
about Joe Christmas as well.
It's almost as if there's so the low,

707
00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:05.620
um,
uh,
so,

708
00:49:05.621 --> 00:49:07.510
so little contents to him,

709
00:49:07.810 --> 00:49:10.510
although I hesitated to say that because that doesn't seem quite right either,

710
00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:13.510
but whatever it is that is lacking in him,

711
00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:17.970
there's no lashing out from him.
Um,
even the killing is not really old.

712
00:49:18.250 --> 00:49:22.930
Didn't seem to be a tongue lashing out at the way he's treated.
Um,

713
00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:26.710
so,
um,
there seems to be just kind of,
uh,
you know,

714
00:49:26.711 --> 00:49:31.420
as blend a slate as possible.
Uh,
although it's probably not as blindness.

715
00:49:31.421 --> 00:49:35.280
Lay this as,
as Lena is,
is a lot more context me,

716
00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:40.680
but still relatively blank slate on which various succession of characters with

717
00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:45.010
right on very,
very dramatic stories.

718
00:49:45.011 --> 00:49:49.180
So this is the structure and that's why there's this very deep kinship between

719
00:49:49.181 --> 00:49:52.600
the two of them,
even though they are totally different.
