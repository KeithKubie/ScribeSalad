00:00:01.068 --> 00:00:02.636
The world of direct
ticket issuing and processing

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.773
was shaken to its core last week
when Ticketmaster, the most...

00:00:06.807 --> 00:00:09.710
That's how I'm gonna say
it from now on. <i>Ticketmaster.</i>

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:11.578
...the most popular
ticket seller in the world

00:00:11.612 --> 00:00:15.048
behind Briansetzerstubs.com--
sure you're all familiar.

00:00:15.082 --> 00:00:18.051
Uh, they're in the midst
of a class-action lawsuit.

00:00:18.085 --> 00:00:21.121
Courts ruled that <i>Ticketmaster</i>
had to pay back consumers

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:24.157
millions and millions of dollars
in bull (bleep) service charges.

00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:26.293
Rather than provide
cash refunds, though,

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:27.728
Ticketmaster's offering vouchers
and discount codes

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:30.464
that can only be used for,
quote, "eligible events,"

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:32.799
which is Ticketmaster code
for (bleep) events.

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:34.535
(laughter)

00:00:34.568 --> 00:00:36.770
Here's what Twitter user

00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:39.373
@Cryptoterra had
to say about it.

00:00:43.177 --> 00:00:44.845
(laughter)

(applause and cheering)

00:00:50.284 --> 00:00:54.188
Could be worse. Imagine opening
your "free vouchers" tab

00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:56.256
and seeing something like
"Walking on the Soleil,"

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.158
the "Smash Mouth
Cirque du Soleil" show.

00:00:58.192 --> 00:00:59.826
