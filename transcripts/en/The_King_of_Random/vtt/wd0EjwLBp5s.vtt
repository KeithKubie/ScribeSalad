00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.340
This little forge is made from
a paint can and some ceramic wool,

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.400
and is a cheap and easy way
to get started in beginning blacksmithing.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.700

[music]

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.300
[music]

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.840
Guys, I'm here with Grant.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.790
This is not the Grant
you're used to seeing.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:16.870
This is another Grant.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:17.940
Grant, say hi.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:18.660
&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.820
&gt;&gt; Today Grant is gonna be
showing us how we can build a forge

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.150
out of a paint can.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.689
Grant, you've done this before right?

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.620
&gt;&gt; I've done it once yeah. 
&gt;&gt; Wonderful.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.260
So we've got a fantastic method
of building a forge out of a paint can,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.020
and it doesn't use too many materials.

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.710
You wanna give us a rundown of what
materials we're going to be using?

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.440
&gt;&gt; So you're gonna need one paint can, um
you can use a big one or a little one.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.140
&gt;&gt; These are available at
the hardware store.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.100
I got this at Home Depot for about $5.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.520
&gt;&gt; You'll need one alumina silicate
firebrick and one one foot by two foot

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.920
length of kaowool blanket.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.300
We got four quarter inch
carriage bolts, 4 inches long,

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.440
we got gour 1/4 inch

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.620
and 2 and 1/2 inch long carriage bolts,

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.100
and 16 quarter inch hex nuts.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.080
&gt;&gt; The fire brick is usually available online,

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.900
or at specialty refractory 
materials stores.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.840
Some places specialize in equipment
and materials to build things

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.850
like pizza ovens.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:07.940
That's a great place to look.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.520
Here's the basic idea.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.399
Carriage bolts will be attached
to the paint can as feet to keep it off

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.200
the ground.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.380
The inside of the can will be lined
with kaowool and a piece of firebrick

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.829
will act as the work surface.

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:19.920
A propane or matte gas torch will be our

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.920
heat source.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.760
Grant, we've got all
of our materials ready.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.140
What is gonna be the first step?

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.020
&gt;&gt; The first step is gonna remove
the inside lining of the paint can,

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.540
because if we don't,

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.700
it'll start burning when
we start using it later on,

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.160
and it's gonna smell really bad.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.860
&gt;&gt; So these cans have sort of a plastic
lining and you can see that

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.340
it's a different color from the metal
and we need to burn all of that out.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.859
Right now, Grant is using the propane
torch to burn the paint

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.000
from the outside of the can.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.420
This is mostly because if you stick the
propane torch down inside of the can,

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.180
it burns up all of the oxygen and
then the torch goes out.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.900
[music]

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.560
Our paint can is now all burned out.

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:00.530
We got rid of all the paint so I think
it's time to move on to the nextstep.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.530
What do we do now?

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.600
&gt;&gt; We're gonna add four carriage
bolts as the feet.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.600
&gt;&gt; We've got the four holes set up about
four inches apart in either direction.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:14.780
[music]

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.480
We've got the four holes drilled in,

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:17.989
we've got our four carriage bolts.

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.840
Since we want a nut on
both sides of the paint can,

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.740
first, we need to thread one on far enough

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.060
that we can fit it on and then back it up.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.880
Grab a pair of pliers just to make
sure that's nice and tight.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.640
Now, we do that three more times.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.020
At this point, you can see
the direction that this forge is going.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.740
We're gonna have a nice
 opening at one side

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.440
and the feet that let it stand up.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.329
But we've also got four more
shorter carriage bolts.

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:42.390
Grant what are we using these for?

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.820
&gt;&gt; We're using these four smaller ones
to put on the bottom of the forge

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.140
so that we can then flip it over.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.560
And it might be a mini foundry.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:58.460
[Music]

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.540
We've now made something that
looks like a steel alien bug.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.099
Is that what we were going for?

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.780
&gt;&gt; Perfect.
Then we nailed it.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:07.860
What's next?

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.460
&gt;&gt; So we're gonna line the inside
now with kale wool.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.360
And we're goinna put a piece
down at the bottom as well.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.640
&gt;&gt; 7 and 1/2 inches by about 18 inches.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.760
That's the measurements we're
getting for our paint can.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.060
&gt;&gt; Technically, you're supposed to
wear a mask and and eye protection

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.280
when you're cutting this stuff.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.340
So, we just thought we'd go overboard.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.680
&gt;&gt; We'll also go outside.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.020
[music]

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.860
So now let's curl this and see how
well it fits inside the can.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:38.400
[music]

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.580
Hey look. 
It fits.

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.560
Now we need a circle with a diameter
of about 3 and half maybe 4 inches.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:52.600
[music]

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.120
All right we've got the can
lined with the kaowool.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.920
Now we've got our fire brick. 
What are we doing with this?

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.080
&gt;&gt; We're gonna cut it out.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.500
to make a work surface to get 
on the very center.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:14.100
[music]

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.940
Just for aesthetic purposes,
we're gonna cut out some small triangle

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.460
pieces to fill these gaps.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:24.600
[music]

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.500
Well neat.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.040
That looks like it might work as a forge.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.700
&gt;&gt; I think we're missing something.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.260
That'll work.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.740
&gt;&gt; So we need the fire
coming out of the torch

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.660
to be going through
the side of the paint can,

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.940
through the kale wool,

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.320
and then blowing fire
right down onto the brick.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.680
We've got our line,
and we're gonna mark along there,

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.150
and we're going to put
the torch kind of near the front.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.860
That way if we want to angle it
a little bit more forward, we can,

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.830
and if we want to twist it and angle
a little bit more backwards, we can.

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.400
If we have the torch too far back,

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.620
then we really only have the
option of angling it forward or down.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.120
Further forward gives
us more space to play with it.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.640
We are using 5/8 inch
forstner bit to drill our hole.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:08.100
[music]

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.100
So at this point,

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.180
we can turn on the fire.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.980
It's gonna get nice and hot in there

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.780
and we can use
 this for blacksmithing right?

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:15.740
&gt;&gt; Yes you can.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:16.580
&gt;&gt; Wonderful.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.040
Is there anything else you want
to do with this can before we

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.400
say we're all finished?

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.610
&gt;&gt; Well we added these four
bolts on the bottom.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.259
We want to turn it into a mini foundry.

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:26.160
We're gonna have to add a second hole.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.060
&gt;&gt; Once again carefully drilling through
the kaowool without it twisting

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.520
and binding up and without
drilling into my fingers.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.220
I choose to keep all of
my fingers for now.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.040
Hopefully, forever.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:37.460
Definitely for now.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.880
Aha!

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.300
And now it's a little foundry.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.940
So we've now got
two holes in our foundry,

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.040
and you say we should
have a small kaowool plug.

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.760
Yeah to just plug whichever
one we're not using.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:51.760
&gt;&gt; Exactly. 
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.620
Well I've got this little spare piece.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.420
Let's cut a plug out of it. 
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.720
&gt;&gt; There. 
Plugged.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.220
Now, when we're using it as a forge,

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.372
the fire won't come out of here,

00:06:01.372 --> 00:06:02.870
and when we're using it as a foundry,

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.120
we can just move the plug and then
the fire won't come out of here.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.260
For the convenience of space
we've come outside.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.479
We've got a piece of railroad track and
we're gonna be using this as an anvil.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:15.900
Let's test if our forge gets hot enough that
we can soften metal and begin to shape it.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.360
Grant, I have a question.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.100
You have no glove on the hand
that's holding the steel,

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.360
but you are wearing
a glove on the other hand.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.360
What's up with that?

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.420
&gt;&gt; When you're working with hot steel,

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.880
you wanna grab the metal 
with a bare hand

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.970
because if you're wearing a glove,
or a plastic glove or something,

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:38.370
you might not feel it's super hot,
and it might burn the leather or the plastic

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:39.370
right into your flesh.

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.150
So you just wanna keep it bare skin.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.920
So you know how hot and how
not the steel is.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.440
Uh with the hammer,

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.400
I just you don't need a glove.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.960
I just use one because it's for padding.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:51.580
Let's flatten it.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.740
I'd say it's pretty flat. 
&gt;&gt; That's flat!

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.780
I mean you could we can make it into
a very large flat-head screwdriver.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.800
Grant thanks for coming out and showing
us how to build this little foundry.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.800
&gt;&gt; You're welcome.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.880
&gt;&gt; I'm hoping that sometime
in the future, we can have you back,

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.169
and you can show us some
of the things we can do with this.

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:19.139
Maybe a little bit of
introductory blacksmithing.

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.360
&gt;&gt; I'd love to, yeah.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.060
&gt;&gt; Guys, we've still got
more for you to see.

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.660
That box up at the top will transport
you directly to our last video,

00:07:25.669 --> 00:07:26.669
go check that out.

00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:29.409
The box in the bottom will show you what
YouTube thinks you should be watching now,

00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:31.289
and this bomb here in the middle
will subscribe you to our channel.

00:07:31.289 --> 00:07:32.920
So you never miss a video.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.040
Don't forget to ring that bell and
we'll see you in the next one.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.000
Talk to you then.
