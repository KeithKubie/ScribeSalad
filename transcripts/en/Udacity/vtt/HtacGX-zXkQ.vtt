00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is the second choice.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
If it were possible to compute discrete logs quickly,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and our adversary had a way to do that,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
well then, they could compute the discrete log of the

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
intercepted value y-A, the g, and the q values,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
which were also intercepted.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Those ones were public,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and the result of this would be the

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
x-A value that was Alice's secret,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and then the adversary can

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
compute the key the same way that Alice would.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This was the only secret value,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and if you had the discrete log function,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
you could compute that secret value.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The second answer doesn't compute the right thing.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
It's computing the straight log of y-B,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
which would be the y-A value.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
That's not the value that is necessary to compute the key.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The third value doesn't use discrete log.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
If we could actually compute the key this way,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
well then the protocol would be completely

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
unsecure because it turns out that

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
modular exponentiation is a function

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
that we can compute efficiently,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and it's necessary that we can compute modular exponentiation efficiently

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
because otherwise, the legitimate participates

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
in the protocol wouldn't be able to determine their keys.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So we will look at that soon.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Before doing that, I want to emphasize that this is not a proof

00:01:07.000 --> 99:59:59.000
that breaking discrete log is hard.
