00:00:03.875 --> 00:00:06.875
When I was a kid, the only companies that made games were the big ones;

00:00:07.042 --> 00:00:08.958
hundreds of people, millions of dollars.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.375
Now, it's two friends that come together in their free time and make games.

00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:16.708
One of the first great games we created was "The Balloons",

00:00:16.833 --> 00:00:18.000
which is an arcade-floater.

00:00:18.083 --> 00:00:20.250
The first thing everyone who played it said was,

00:00:20.375 --> 00:00:22.708
It's difficult, impossible. Nobody is actually enjoying it.

00:00:22.708 --> 00:00:24.000
Yes, we had an audience,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.250
but not soliciting feedback hurt us a lot.

00:00:27.542 --> 00:00:29.042
Which we did do in "KleptoCats".

00:00:29.167 --> 00:00:32.250
We did a soft launch and we checked all the feedback that

00:00:32.375 --> 00:00:34.500
people were giving to try to improve it.

00:00:34.542 --> 00:00:37.125
We have to find that sweet spot between what we do

00:00:37.208 --> 00:00:39.542
and what people want, to be able to continue.

00:00:41.042 --> 00:00:43.667
For our players, to keep them playing,

00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:49.333
we try to optimize the essence of fun and what it is that makes games interesting today.

00:00:49.417 --> 00:00:51.750
We believe there are these moments

00:00:52.083 --> 00:00:55.000
when the surprise is brought to you that generate a lot of emotion in the game.

00:00:55.083 --> 00:00:57.292
Which kind of represents gacha machines,

00:00:57.375 --> 00:00:59.708
where something falls and it's a surprise.

00:01:01.042 --> 00:01:05.000
For a long time in the world of games casual gaming was a bad thing, but not for us.

00:01:05.083 --> 00:01:08.833
We embrace casual gaming and we try to make experiences that respect your time

00:01:09.083 --> 00:01:11.167
and that don't have a barrier to entry.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.417
SkyAlert's mission as a company is to save lives.

00:01:17.167 --> 00:01:20.542
Yes, Mexico is at a constant seismic risk.

00:01:20.833 --> 00:01:25.125
We need to create technologies to help us live better all the time,

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.042
and help us coexist with this matter of seismic phenomena,

00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:32.667
and to prepare ourselves much better as a society.

00:01:33.292 --> 00:01:37.292
What you need to think when launching a subscription model is,

00:01:37.625 --> 00:01:39.750
what value you will give the user.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.167
This app allows you to receive several notifications in real time

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.458
when our own network of detectors

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.292
confirms an earthquake.

00:01:51.875 --> 00:01:57.208
We began not only giving seismic warnings, but including new features and modules.

00:01:57.333 --> 00:02:00.750
This allows not only to convert users into subscribers,

00:02:00.792 --> 00:02:04.667
but to have a retention rate of almost 50%.

00:02:04.792 --> 00:02:07.208
After three months the people who downloaded the app,

00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:10.833
keep using it basically every day.

00:02:11.875 --> 00:02:16.208
We already have 47% of users who pay annually,

00:02:16.583 --> 00:02:18.250
and 53% who pay monthly.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.375
As the app becomes self-renewing, the company becomes self-sustaining.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.458
In the Latin American market, 70% of people were overweight.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.583
Only 3% of people had access to gyms.

00:02:32.875 --> 00:02:35.292
With InstaFit users find that without worrying,

00:02:35.417 --> 00:02:39.667
without spending too much, without having to go to a gym,

00:02:39.875 --> 00:02:42.750
or having to buy equipment or weights;

00:02:42.833 --> 00:02:44.708
they can have routines

00:02:44.792 --> 00:02:47.792
that are extremely varied with all kinds of disciplines,

00:02:47.833 --> 00:02:49.250
that they can do at home

00:02:49.333 --> 00:02:51.833
in a ten square foot space without needing anything.

00:02:53.167 --> 00:02:55.000
The subscription model is the future.

00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:58.167
The subscription model allows you to plan your revenue

00:02:58.583 --> 00:03:03.083
and thus generate a sustainable business that grows with a base of engaged users.

00:03:04.208 --> 00:03:08.667
Last year, we grew 450% with our Android subscriber base,

00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:13.417
due to the fact we hired a better team of internal developers.

00:03:13.583 --> 00:03:16.750
We dedicated many more resources to the marketing budget,

00:03:16.833 --> 00:03:19.542
and we started doing much more optimization tests

00:03:19.667 --> 00:03:24.125
both in acquisition and in user retention, exclusively on Android.

00:03:28.125 --> 00:03:30.625
One of our tests included changing

00:03:30.708 --> 00:03:33.875
the seven day trial period to one of 30 days.

00:03:34.042 --> 00:03:38.208
And that had an immediate impact of a 25% increase

00:03:38.333 --> 00:03:41.583
in the volume of our free trials.

00:03:42.833 --> 00:03:44.333
Understanding your users

00:03:44.458 --> 00:03:47.167
and supporting them throughout their experience with the app

00:03:47.417 --> 00:03:51.250
lets you build a business that is growing with a loyal user base

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.583
that stays with you for a long time.
