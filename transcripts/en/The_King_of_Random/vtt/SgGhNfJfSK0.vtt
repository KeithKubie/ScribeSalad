00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.020
Hey, what's up guys? I'm hanging out today with my brother

00:00:03.029 --> 00:00:07.240
He came out from Texas because we're doing an experiment with car batteries, and he used to work with car batteries

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.039
I did. He used to sell them but we're not selling them today. We're actually gonna be hacking them open

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.639
And I got a new car

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.929
We thought what a better way to celebrate than to rip the battery out, crack it open and show you what's inside?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.310
So let's get right to it

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.230
Now thing about Lexus is they have decorative shrouds that cover a lot of the engine components, which makes it look really nice

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.139
But makes it kind of difficult to get down into the components themselves

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.429
So we've got to pop off all these plastic rivets in order to be able to access the battery compartment

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.148
And that's just a matter of taking off a few screws and pulling the battery right up and out

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.939
All right we're gonna take the negative terminal off first

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.279
Once the negative is disconnected the electrical system should be protected

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.790
And we'll go to the positive next

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.879
So update guys we disconnected the positive negative terminals. We released the J-Hook and

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.979
Bracket that holds the battery down in the car

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.270
It should be ready to just pull out [sure] so we're gonna just keep this thing out and show

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.659
You what it looks like. I'll get this one since your gloves are like shredded. Yeah, they're gone

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.480
All right. Dude this thing's really heavy

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.049
These batteries are like 40 to 50 pounds they're super super heavy and you can see there's a liquid in here if you shake it

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.769
It'll slosh around. You can actually even see the liquid moving. This is called a wet

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.770
cell battery. There are types of batteries that are called non-spillable

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.540
And they have an absorbent glass mat on the inside that will soak up the sulfuric acid and keep it from spilling out

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.460
But what we're after is actually this stuff

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.099
This is a mixture of about 25 to 30 percent

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.110
Sulfuric acid and the rest is water and we're after that sulfuric acid and the lead plates inside

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.259
So let's go crack this thing open and make that a reality

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.249
Alright Guys so we're in the workshop and we're ready to crack this thing open. What's the best way to open a lead acid battery?

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:33.360
Probably to not to

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.000
But we're gonna do it anyway. Get a big bucket of

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.080
Baking soda water is really important because it is a basic solution and since we're dealing with acids if anything goes wrong

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.369
We'll have a place where we can neutralize that acid very quickly.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.060
It's good to have this setup standing by. If you were to open these ports and tip it over it would spill out

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.560
This is a spill-able battery it's not recommended to take these vents off

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.620
But you can see if we do it opens a little port here where you can add more water

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.240
You want to use distilled water to top off your battery you don't want to add more acid. That's correct. All right

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.600
Looks like things are getting pretty serious

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.630
Let's do this! Let's get down to business. Because these have acid on them if I drop them into the solution of baking soda

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.630
We should see it fizz a little bit

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:19.629
And that's an indication that I actually have battery acid on my gloves now as well. Good stuff. Check it out guys

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.499
We got the six ports taken off the top and you can already see the battery acid in there

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.180
So actually the safest way at this point

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.959
Would probably just be to take it over to a container

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.790
turn it over and safely get the

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.130
Acid out of there without having to crack anything and because we're working with sulfuric acid the kind of container

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.130
We want to be using is glass. Here we go

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.759
With splashes. I hope you have a good replacement battery because I don't think you're driving anywhere anytime soon

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:49.479
Yeah. If you feel your skin start itching it's a good time to slap some baking soda solution on it. If it gets on your clothes

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.380
It'll bleach the color out of them. That's good enough for now. If I'm not mistaken

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.199
This is about 70% water and there's a really easy way to concentrate the acid and that's simply by boiling the water off

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.679
But you got to make sure you're using the right kind of container when you do that or it'll explode

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.489
So we don't know if this is plastic welded together or if it's glued or what it is

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.849
We're gonna use some tools and try and pry it up gently to see if we can just gently remove that container, if not

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.850
we'll bring out the big guns.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.020
I feel like this could work you got to be careful when you're pulling this up because if it snaps, it can spit acid back in

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.600
your face, so probably good time to put your safety glasses on

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.460
It seems to be working pretty well

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.229
My thumb's like full on so yeah, I'll be right back. I'm gonna go put on a new glove. All right

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.520
we got the seal broken.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.059
I think this lid is actually attached to the lead plates right now,

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.079
so if we can find a way to pull those up and out or disconnect them

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.870
We should be in business

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.619
Success, so this is what the inside of a car battery looks like guys and you can see how there are lead plates divided into six

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:01.220
different cells. Each one of these cells generates two volts and by linking them all in series we get a 12-volt battery.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.220
I think what we're gonna do now is pour out the rest of this acid

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.239
and then we're gonna extract these lead plates, soak them in a solution of baking soda water to

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.410
neutralize the acid and then we'll take a look at what kind of materials we'd been able to salvage here. First thing

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.949
we're gonna do is break up all these terminals because right now if we short this out

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.950
we could eventually have a disaster on our hands

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.950
Luckily for us lead is a relatively soft metal and just with a little poking and prying

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.950
we should be able to break these things right off.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.550
Oh, it sparks on that

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.830
So now can one of these battery casings be recycled?

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:32.400
Yeah

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.280
Actually about

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.510
98% of the battery could be recycled.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.779
And the reason that you want to take these to recycling depot is because the lead content. The lead, the sulfuric acid,

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.249
just in general it's it's not really something you want to put into a landfill when you want to get rid of a car battery

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.450
You can recycle them by taking them to any auto parts dealer. Okay, Hold on one second Mark

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.840
The reveal

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.559
Here we go. All I'm gonna do is just dump them in this bucket here. Watch how much this fizzes when the acid hits it

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.180
Wow, it's a powerful reaction. It's starting to stink though

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.269
Uno mÃ¡s? Wow, I think we're breaching the upper limits here. Yeah

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.600
Put a wooden spoon over it

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.459
Now this is generating all kinds of gas which smells terrible and I don't believe the gas is flammable and to prove it

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.049
I'm willing to light it with a BBQ igniter. I've got a fire extinguisher here, got a lit flame here

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.180
Let's go ahead and test this thing out

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.159
Now you see the flame just went out that's because it actually is carbon dioxide coming out

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.040
The carbon dioxide will steal the oxygen and won't sustain a flame

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.879
every time. You can see some of these are not actually encased

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.499
All these other ones have like a vinyl pouch around them which I imagine is some kind of a permeable membrane

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.560
but looking at these things up close you can say this contains lead.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.420
It's really thin and there's like a metal

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.840
mesh in there to hold it all together, but that right there is basically lead metal

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.590
and there's a lot of cool things you can do with lead metal and we're going to be harvesting this. So guys we gotta

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.429
run, but we are not done with this project yet. We're gonna catch you in the next video

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.090
What we've got is some sulfuric acid that we are gonna concentrate down

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:12.749
We've got some lead plates that we are going to salvage and turn into all kinds of cool stuff

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.140
and we got this plastic casing that we're basically going to clean up and recycle

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.159
So big thanks to my brother Mark, coming all the way up here from Texas to be with us today

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:21.810
Hopefully you guys learned something new

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.070
now you know what's inside your car battery

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.550
So we're gonna come back to you with a new video showing you what you do with lead and

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.249
sulfuric acid from a car battery, it's really cool stuff

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.640
It's really crazy science and we'll be looking for you in that video. Talk to you then, bye.
