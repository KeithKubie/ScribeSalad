00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.290
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:18.850
[silence]

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.240
&gt;&gt; ANGEL VU: Welcome to the Library

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.490
of Congress' annual
Asian-Pacific-American Heritage

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.670
month keynote event.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.890
My name is Angel Vu and I have the
privilege of serving as president

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.060
of the Library of Congress
Asian-American Association.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.180
The event today was made possible
through the combined efforts

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.120
of the Humanities and Social
Sciences division LCAAA

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.920
and LC Globe.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.610
I ask you to help me acknowledge
the groups and individuals

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.300
who have made this event
possible, with a special thank you

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.020
to the Librarian's office
for their participation.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:06.310
[applause]

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.450 position:56%
&gt;&gt; In 1978, a joint
congressional resolution established

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.010
Asian-Pacific-American
Heritage Week.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.610
The first 10 days of May
were chosen to coincide

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.510
with two major milestones in
Asian Pacific American history.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.210
May 7th, 1843, which
marked the arrival

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:37.280 position:56%
of the first Japanese immigrants in
the Unites States, and May 10, 1869,

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.030
the completion date of the
Transcontinental Railroad,

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.180
upon which many Chinese
workers labored.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.360
In 1992, Congress expanded
the observance

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.960
into a month-long celebration
now known as the Asian American

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.590 position:56%
and Pacific Islander Heritage Month.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.750
This year the White House has
once again issued a presidential

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.140
proclamation designating May

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.080
as Asian Pacific American Heritage
Month, acknowledging the men

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.440
and women of Asian and
Pacific ancestry who continue

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.350
to make many important
contributions to our nation.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.660
This year's theme is "Unite Our
Voices by Speaking Together."

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.770
This theme encourages the various
AAPI communities to join together

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:39.310
to honor and acknowledge
heritage, self and community

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.530
and to celebrate diversity.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:48.310
The AAPI experience varies greatly,
and all groups must join together

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.660
to communicate our
individual experiences.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.600
Diversity is a journey, and
we cannot travel there alone.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.470
By uniting our voices we can
raise issues and tell stories

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.350
that elevate the AAPI community.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.930
With this theme we hope to improve
representation in the workplace

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.700
by communicating the benefits
of a diverse workforce.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.560
Today's program draws on
our diversity of experience

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.800
and illustrates the
principle of inclusion

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.710
that enriches our understanding
of the world.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.910
So here to introduce
our featured speaker,

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.000
please welcome the Librarian
of Congress, Dr. Carla Hayden.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:47.760
[applause]

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.660
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Thank you for
inviting me here to be part

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.100
of the event and for the sponsors.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:03.070
I'm honored to be in a different
position of introducing the person

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:11.900
who usually makes sure that
my introductions are accurate,

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.900
and has been a part

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.870
of my professional
journey for quite a while.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.290
Someone said, "Do you
need a lot of notes

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.750
and things about Roswell Encina?"

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.420
I said, "I don't think so."

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:33.360
But you have, in your
program, his curriculum vita.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:40.350
You have his resume, and you see
he had a distinguished career

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.980
in journalism, and was a person
who was asking the questions,

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.230
who was right on the scene
in so many instances.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:56.580
When the Enoch Pratt Free
Library was looking for someone

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.170
to tell the library's story,
to help us shape our message

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:05.590
at a pretty difficult time
in the library's history.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:12.010
We were looking for that person
who would guide me as the CEO,

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:18.390 position:56%
and who would guide the entire staff
and bring a sense of unity and sense

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.140
of purpose to what we were doing.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.750
We knew what we were doing,
and that we had that purpose,

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.600
but we wanted to communicate
it and bring people in.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.160
Roswell Encina was the
person that was chosen.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.810
And I asked him, I said, "You're
going from getting the news

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.200
to making the news and what
is it about public service,"

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:49.740 position:56%
because it was entering a different
arena, "that attracted you to this?"

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.780
And he said, "I want
to tell good stories.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:06:01.450
I want to bring out the positive
aspects of what everyone is doing

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.070
and what the human
experience can be,"

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.180
and that's what cinched it for us.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.700
The other part, personally
and professionally as someone

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:15.760
who was leading this effort
that I needed, was a no-man,

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.130
an N-O man, not a yes person.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:24.560
You can find a lot of people
who'll say, "Yes, it's great

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.770
and you just go and do it.

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:35.370
That was a great speech, and you
look great today, you just wow."

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:41.110
I wanted, and the reason why I have
him here with me on the journey

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.970
at the Library of Congress
was I needed someone

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.480
that would literally go, "No.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:54.200
No. You're going to wear that?

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.890
Oh, don't say that.

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:03.530
No." I needed someone that would
have the strength of conviction,

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:08.390
the courage to look me in
the face and say, "No."

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:11.810
That's the most important thing,
that trust, that confidence,

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:16.720
and that's why I am more than
pleased and honored to bring

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.160
to this stage the Library

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:24.440
of Congress' No-man,
Mr. Roswell Encina.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:34.460
[applause]

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:35.760
&gt;&gt; ROSWELL ENCINA: Oh, boy.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.060
Here we go.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:38.360
Good afternoon to everyone.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.660
I want to thank Dr.
Hayden, of course,

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:40.960
and Robert for being
here this afternoon, and,

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.760
of course, for introducing me.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.060
Usually it's the other way around.

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.010
As she says, I'm the one who's
usually, regularly introducing her

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:49.670
to come up to the stage, so it's
a little weird doing it the other

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:50.970
way around.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:53.460
I also want to thank her
for allowing me to be part

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.960
of this journey here to
the Library of Congress.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.450
When friends still ask me to this
day, "How are you doing there?"

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:01.040
My regular response is like, "Oh,

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.600
it's like winning the
Power Ball of jobs."

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.140
I'm still pinching myself every
day to make sure that this is real

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:09.210
and I get to come in every day,

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:11.140
see the wonderful collection
that's presented

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.620
to us almost on a regular basis.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.890 position:56%
Most of my friends are still
envious when I post it on Instagram.

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:19.760
And, of course, I get to work with
a marvelous staff like all of you.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.390 position:56%
Now, I also want to thank the
Library's Asian-American Association

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:26.250
led by Angel Vu for
inviting me to speak today.

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:29.950
When she emailed me several months
ago I was like, "Are you sure?

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:32.580
Do you really want me?"

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:33.880
I'm dropping my glasses here.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:38.610
I'm very humbled, and I
really appreciate all this.

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:42.560
I also want to thank the Humanities
and Social Services Division led

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:46.650
by James Sweany and the LC Globe
Association led by Megan Metcalf

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:48.230
for co-hosting today as well.

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:51.720
I also want to thank the
staff of the Asian Division.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.630
They were very kind enough
to show me around last week.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.970
I have a confession, that was my
first time at the Asian Division

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.280 position:56%
after being here for several months,

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.180
but they were very
generous with their time.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.480
They showed me around.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.100
They showed me some collections
that were from the Philippines,

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:06.200
including these bamboo
scrolls, so it was very cool.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.940
I know they put a display
up every month,

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:11.300
and I encourage all of
you to go look at it.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:16.200
Now, so for being the first
African-American woman

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.370
as the Librarian of Congress, see,
I'm so used to saying that now

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:21.740
and typing it up for you,
I have to say it out loud.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:25.450
But, no joking, get a
little serious here.

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:28.050
It is a very big honor

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:31.310
to be speaking during
Asian-American Month.

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:34.000
It feels very personal to
me to be talking about this.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.030 position:56%
Usually I'm writing for people and
writing about people, it feels weird

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:41.650
that I'm actually talking
about myself.

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:43.240
Today's theme of "Unite Our Voices

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.170
by Speaking Together"
is very empowering.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:49.370 position:56%
Whether you're Pilipino-American,
Chinese-American, Japanese-American,

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:53.170 position:56%
Vietnamese-American, Korean-American
or whether you're Asian-American,

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:58.930
African-American, Jewish-American,
white, straight, gay,

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:00.590
we all have our voices here.

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:04.110
Our voices together is louder.

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:07.110
Our stories together
carry a lot of weight.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:09.690
The theme "Unite Our Voices

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:12.820
by Speaking Together" should
not be read like a tagline

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:15.300
or a goal that we need to meet.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:19.280
It should be considered like
a duty, like a call to action.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:23.090 position:56%
I believe everyone's voice should be
heard, something that was instilled

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:25.760
in me at a very young
age by my family.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.360
When I was in grade
school, actually,

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:32.310
I remember my late grandmother
gathering all her grandchildren

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:36.200
and saying in Tagalog
[Tagalog language].

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:42.320
In English it means
be a star that shines.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:45.380
Whether her advice was to go
out and hit it big in Hollywood,

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.340
and actually one of my cousins
actually took that heart

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:50.040
and is now a big soap opera
star in the Philippines.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:54.420
But what she meant was
to stand out in a crowd.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:58.840 position:56%
It's a very grandmotherly advice, I
think, but it has helped me navigate

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.050
through life and to make
sure my voice is heard

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:03.290
and that someone is
always listening.

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:07.720 position:56%
I never thought when I made a
career change more than a decade ago

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.670 position:56%
that I would land right here at the
Library of Congress, or, better yet,

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:13.190
addressing a crowd here
in the Mumford Room.

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:17.420 position:56%
Dr. Hayden likes to tell her story
about being an accidental librarian,

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.400
so I have another confession.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:24.020
Like her, working at a
library was by pure accident.

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:27.650
Since I was a teenager I wanted
to be a TV reporter or anchor.

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:30.670
I remember watching Bryant Gumble
on the Today Show and looking

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:33.010
up to him and admiring him dearly.

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:36.870
Bryant, as you all know, was the
first African-American anchor

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:38.700
for a network morning news show.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:42.360
He was smart, he was a good
interviewer, he was well-poised,

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.030
he was confident and
dressed very sharp.

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:48.980 position:56%
Then I told myself, "One day I'm
going to be the first Asian-American

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.610
to anchor the Today Show."

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:53.090 position:56%
It wasn't going to be easy, clearly.

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:57.140
Since I was a year old we were
living and bouncing back and forth

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:58.930
between the States
and the Philippines.

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:01.890
My parents, both who
are Filipino immigrants,

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:03.190
who came to this country.

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:05.160
My father came here in the 60s.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.760
My mother arrived in the 70s.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.930
My mother was a school
teacher and my father was

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:11.670
in the United States Navy.

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:14.540
Both are first generation Filipinos
from their respective families

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:16.660
to come to the States,
so it was a big deal.

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.970
My parents wanted to make sure
I knew my heritage and culture,

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:21.870
so we lived in the
Philippines off and on

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:24.100
since I was a kid to
when I was an adult.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:27.520
My parents promised me that we
would move back to the States

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:30.040
after I graduated from college.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:33.120
Well, it happened a little bit
faster than they anticipated.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:36.930 position:56%
After attending several schools here
in the States, then on U.S. bases

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:39.680
and a private school
in the Philippines,

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.810
I graduated high school
when I was 16.

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:44.020
Then I graduated college
with a Bachelor of Science

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:46.920
and Marketing Management
when I was only 19.

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:50.020
So, I was very young, and
very naive, I should say.

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:53.430
But true to their word we moved
back to the States immediately,

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:56.050
and immediately I decided,
"I'm going to go

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:58.330
after that Today Show job."

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:01.780
So I went back to school and
graduated with a Bachelor of Arts

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:04.520
in Communications, focus
on broadcast journalism.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:08.070
For more than 12 years I hit the
streets as a reporter and anchor.

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:10.370
It allowed me to see the best and,

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:12.710
unfortunately, the
worst of humanity.

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:14.330
It took me across the
country reporting

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:16.800
on some unforgettable stories,

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.910
allowing me to witness
some glorious moments.

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:22.670 position:56%
Like when this little seven year old
boy who was missing in the mountains

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:24.590
of Arkansas was reunited
with his parents

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:28.060
after he was missing during a
severe thunderstorm overnight

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:29.360
and just seeing the parents,

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:32.380
their relieved eyes seeing
this seven year boy alive.

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:37.520
Or when John Glenn returned to
space in his 70s and I was able

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.900
to cover it and watch
the shuttle launch.

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:43.820
And covering and watching
football fans pack Memorial Stadium

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:48.380
when the Baltimore Ravens had their
very first home game in Baltimore.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:52.900
But, along with these good stories
come the heartbreaking ones, like,

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:58.210 position:56%
meeting shocked families whose homes
were demolished after a tornado

00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:00.180
in Tennessee and Alabama.

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:02.950
Covering the Birmingham abortion
clinic bombing and talking

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:06.470
to the victims' families, including
a nurse whose body was covered

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:07.810
with shrapnel.

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:10.890
And interviewing grief-stricken
mothers after their son

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:12.880
or daughter were murdered,
which, sadly,

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.400 position:56%
I had to do on a very regular basis.

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.600
But, there were a lot
of fun times too.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:22.620 position:56%
You practically get to live and
experience your childhood fantasies,

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:24.740
like riding NASA's vomit comet.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:27.140
If you don't know that is,
that's the plane that does this,

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.810 position:56%
and it allows you to go zero gravity

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:34.170
when it's diving down,
and we did it 26 times.

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:37.180
I should say, I'm proud
to say I didn't puke.

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:40.220
That's why it's called
the vomit comet.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:42.810
Then I was able to go
sky diving in Texas.

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:45.300
I went hiking and extreme
kayaking outside of Seattle.

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:48.790
I went salmon fishing in Alaska,
ice climbing in New Hampshire

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:51.230
and rode a biplane
while it was flying

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:55.300
over the stadium during
a baseball game.

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:57.770
Now, the stories did
allow me to use my voice,

00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:59.340
and my grandmother got her wish.

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.160
I was standing out.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:05.100 position:56%
I can go on and on about my
reporting stories that I've covered,

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.900
but the best part of the job,
I was the voice for the people

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:11.330
who didn't have the platform or
opportunity to tell their story.

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.230
These are the stories
that impacted me the most.

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:17.690
Some people, like strangers,
these strangers, rather,

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:20.250
I will never forget, but had
the honor to tell their stories.

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:24.220 position:56%
Like this mother from Harvest,
Alabama whose son was just murdered.

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:28.070
I covered the murder,
but his organs were used

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:29.820
to save other people's lives.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:33.980
So her next mission was
to promote organ donation.

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:35.940
Then there was one of the
first stories I ever covered

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:38.980
as a young reporter, was
this man from Georgetown,

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.870
Delaware who was dying of AIDS.

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:44.620
Despite that his body was covered
in the effects of the disease,

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:48.060
he persisted and kept on sewing
the panel for the AIDS quilt.

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:50.870
And then there was this
Asian-American cowboy who I met

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:54.660
in Cheyenne, Wyoming who
was pursuing his dream

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:56.760
of being a bull rider
despite, you know,

00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:00.160
Asian parents would
not approve of that.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.040
Now, reporting was very rewarding.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.630
Along the way I did receive
several reporting awards

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:08.260
and was nominated several
times for an Emmy,

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.260
but like Susan Lucci,
it never happened.

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.580
Opportunities were opening up,

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:16.890
but never that Today Show
door that I always wanted.

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:21.400
So after years of reporting on
storms, murders, political scandals

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.700
and those Black Friday

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:26.160
after Thanksgiving sales I
decided it was time for a change.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.050
Plus, that dream of
being on the Today Show

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:30.890
as the first Asian-American was
already claimed by Ann Curry

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:33.690
on the Today Show and Julie
Chen on the CBS early show.

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:38.960
The thing was, I knew I needed a
change, I just didn't know what.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.810
So, I'm truly grateful for
what my parents have given me.

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:44.110
I am an only child.

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:45.800
Some may say I'm spoiled,

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.340
but in Asian families they
love spoiling their children.

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:51.480
My parents did raise me by
spotlighting the importance

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:54.490
of service and giving
back to the community,

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:56.690
pride and heritage and
practicing humility.

00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:59.470
And it's probably those
virtues that led me

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:01.710
to the Enoch Pratt Free
Library in Baltimore.

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:05.230
While working two jobs at the
CBS affiliate in Baltimore

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:07.660
and the Fox Affiliate
here in Washington D.C.,

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.690
I learned that the director
of communications positions

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:12.350
at the Pratt library was available.

00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:15.040
Honestly, I was a little
apprehensive at first.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:19.460
After working my entire
adult life as a reporter,

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:22.440
but luckily enough the Pratt
was going through a rebranding.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:25.910
They had a big media night for
everybody to get a little feel

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:28.300
of how the library was so they
could show us the new logo,

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:31.400
the new tagline and the collection.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.710
And like Dr. Hayden, she
loves to tell the story

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:37.030
of when she was a young
librarian when she saw Judy Zucker

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:38.340
on the floor at a storefront

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:42.140
in Chicago doing story
time to kids with autism.

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.940
Something that night at the
Pratt clicked in my head as well,

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:49.060
so I knew I had to try this out.

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:50.840
After a panel of interviews
and meeting

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:53.570
with Dr. Hayden I was
fortunate enough to get the job.

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:55.740 position:56%
God, it would have been
embarrassing if it went another way.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:18:00.330
In a matter of days of starting at
the Pratt I knew I belonged there.

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:02.920
It felt like an empty
canvas of opportunity.

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:07.000
I realized once again I found
an opportunity to use my voice.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.920 position:56%
My grandmother's advice ringing in
my head, "Make this place stand out.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.220
Make it a star."

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:15.900
The Pratt Library felt like,
personally, my second act.

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.300
And along with Dr. Hayden and
the talented staff in Baltimore,

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:21.780
we made the Enoch Pratt Free shine.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:24.170
People learned that the library
is more than a place of books,

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:26.280
and I was learning
this at the same time.

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:29.430
Whether you are a parent looking
for a place for story time

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:31.520
or someone looking for a job.

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:34.290
From meeting best-selling authors
like Tony Morrison and Pat Conroy

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:36.430 position:56%
to hosting Vice President Joe Biden.

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:40.350
So you might be thinking, "How does
my whole mantra of using my voice

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:44.420
or standing out work while
working at a library?"

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:46.410
Well, I had those concerns
too when I started,

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:48.830
but it went away very quickly.

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:51.450
Because of my position at the
Pratt I was allowed to talk

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:54.730
and promote the library
across the city and the state.

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:58.020
This time my voice was
once again helping others.

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.520
People were suddenly excited
to learn about all the programs

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.740
and resources available
at the Pratt Library.

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:06.970
Like an elderly woman who lived
in one of Baltimore's food deserts

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:09.420
who was so grateful after
she was the story on TV

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:11.530
about the Pratt's virtual
supermarket,

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:14.020
that is you could order
your groceries

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:16.230 position:56%
from the Pratt Library right next
door and it would be delivered there

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:20.010
and they didn't have to take
the bus or pay $20 on a cab just

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:21.410
to go to the grocery store.

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:24.540
Or a gentleman who was very
grateful that he learned on Twitter

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:26.850
that the library offered
career assistance.

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:30.870
It was very sobering and he came
back to the library one day saying,

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:32.840
"Thank you for letting
me know about this.

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.140
Thank you for all the help.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.610
I was able to secure a
job at the ballpark."

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:37.970
But, of course, the importance

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:41.240
of the library became very evident
during the riots in Baltimore.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.520
This is when all the branches
of the Pratt stayed open,

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.250
including the one smack in
the middle of the unrest.

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:49.630
Residents were protective of the
library and extremely grateful.

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:52.300
There was this one elderly
woman who came up to the desk.

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:55.760
You could tell she works hard
for her money, but she put $5

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.670
on that desk and said,
"Thank you for staying open."

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:03.050
The world was watching the Pratt
during the Baltimore riots.

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:06.920
From MSNBC to MTV people
were noticing,

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:09.830
including some folks
here in Washington.

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:12.710
So, it is hard to believe that
we started here at the Library

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:14.800
of Congress eight months ago.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:18.360 position:56%
As I said earlier, some days I still
can't believe this is all happening.

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.810
I'm working with some
very talented people.

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:24.170
It's serious work, but as this past
week has shown we can have a lot

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:26.270
of fun here as well.

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:28.810
When Dr. Hayden was sworn in
as the first African-American

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:33.270
and first woman to be the Librarian
of Congress it was historic.

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:37.520
But as Dr. Hayden is making
history, we all are too.

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.090
This past week former
President Obama received a

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:41.520
"Profiles in Courage Award."

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:44.420
During his speech he said this,

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:46.210
"Ordinary people doing
the right thing

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:48.410 position:56%
who don't get attention nor seek it,

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:51.360
that's what has always
defined America."

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:54.810
He continued by saying that
that very Kennedy-esque idea

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:57.990
that America is not the
project of any one person,

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:00.880
and that each of us
can make a difference.

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:04.010
What the former president said
kind of hits you right in the gut.

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:07.930 position:56%
He could be talking about all of us,
every single person who works here

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:09.920
at the Library of Congress.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:12.640
Everyone in this institution
is part of making history.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.730
As Dr. Hayden has set the vision
and the tone for all of us,

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:18.870
we have this amazing and
wonderful task to make this happen.

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:22.580
Whether you're preserving historic
documents or curating an exhibit

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:25.190
or whether you're running
a camera or interpreting

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:29.290
or even throwing a massive disco
party, this is what it's all about.

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:31.660 position:56%
We are bringing something different.

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:35.340
There are about 181
Asian-American LC staff members.

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:38.880
That is just a fraction of the
total staff here at the Library,

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:41.440
but the greatness is in the mix.

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.930
We are all part of different
voices here at the Library,

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:46.220
and I'm very proud to
be part of this mix now.

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:49.350
I said earlier the theme
of "Unite Our Voices

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:52.350
by Speaking Together"
is very empowering.

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:56.100
You don't have to use your physical
voice to be heard, but your actions

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:59.630
and your words and
your work speak louder.

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:03.090 position:56%
Remember, your work here is
benefiting someone around the globe.

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:07.530
In closing, I want to quote
the Philippines national hero,

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:09.830
Dr. Jose Rosal.

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:15.040
He says in Tagalog:
[Tagalog language].

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:18.650
&gt;&gt; My mother would be very
proud that I said that right.

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:23.410
In English he says, "He who
does not know how to look back

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:27.330
at where you came from will
never get to his destination."

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:32.710
I believe the people you meet, the
experiences you've lived shape you.

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:36.570
From that mother in Alabama to
that AIDS patient in Delaware,

00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:38.140
from the librarians
at the Pratt Library,

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:41.590
to my new amazing family here
at the Library of Congress.

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:44.410
You made me, me.

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:48.510
So, use your voice and
as my grandmother said,

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:50.690
shine bright like a star.

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:52.490
Thank you.

00:22:52.490 --> 00:23:03.060
[applause]

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:05.350
&gt;&gt; JAMES SWEANY: Thank you
Roswell for your uplifting message,

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:07.900
and thank you Dr. Hayden
for supporting this event.

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:12.480
We also thank you for
attending today's event.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:15.560
I'm Jay Sweeney of the Humanities
and Social Sciences Division,

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.290
a division who's staff
provide reference services

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:22.340
and collection development in
subjects that encompass information

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:26.490
in the arts, humanities,
social sciences, local history

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:29.110
and genealogy in the
main reading room

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:31.150
of the Thomas Jefferson building.

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:35.360
In today's program we're also
highlighting the collections

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:37.180
of the Library of Congress.

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:42.260
We have pulled a sampling of the
collections in the back for you.

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:45.110
Collections relating to the
culture and contribution

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:48.750
of Filipino-Americans in the
collections, and invite you

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:51.950
to browse these items
after the event.

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:56.340
To research more, we invite you
to visit a portal coordinated

00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:01.250
by the Library,
asianpacificheritage.gov.

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:03.990
This portal lists exhibits
and collections

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:07.750
of multiple federal agencies,
including the National Archives,

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:11.910 position:56%
National Endowment for the
Humanities, National Gallery of Art,

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:14.880
the National Park Service,
the Smithsonian Institution

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.340
and the Library of Congress.

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:22.150
To discover the collections of the
Library I refer you to the guide

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:25.410
of Asian-American Pacific
Islander resources at the Library

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:28.570
of Congress linked to the
portal and also available

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:30.830
as a handout in the back.

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:34.460
But also for more information, too,
consult our reference librarians,

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:39.120
both on site and online through
our Ask a Librarian services.

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:47.560
Again, thank you for coming.

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:49.590
[applause]

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:50.890
&gt;&gt; MEGAN METCALF: Hello everyone.

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:52.190
My name is Meg Metcalf.

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:55.620
I'm the 2017 chair of LC
Globe, and on behalf of Globe

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:59.020
and the LC AAA we would
like to present Mr. Encino

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:01.760
with this certificate of
appreciation and say thank you

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.070
for your presentation today

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:06.680
and for making this library a
better place to work and to learn.

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:20.490
[applause]

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:21.790
&gt;&gt; ANDREW GAUDIO: Hello everyone.

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:27.250
My name is Andrew Gaudio, and I'm
the 2017 program chair for LCAAA.

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:32.540
On behalf of LCAAA we would like to
thank Roswell for speaking today.

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:36.220
It was very much an honor
to have him here today.

00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:40.030
We'd also like to thank the
Librarian of Congress, Dr. Hayden,

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:42.150
for supporting today's event.

00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:43.900
And also like to thank
the Humanities

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:46.600
and Social Sciences
Division and LC Globe

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:48.490
for being a part of
the program today.

00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:52.210
Finally, we would like to thank
you all in the audience for coming

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:56.210
and for engaging in
this experience with us.

00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:58.310
We hope that this celebration
was enjoyable

00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:01.090
and informative for you all.

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:02.660
We must emphasize that Asian

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:06.920
and Pacific American Heritage Month
provides us with a chance to share

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.710
and reflect on how far the Asian

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:12.750
and Pacific American community
has come, and where it is going.

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:15.240
This month represents
an annual opportunity

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.650
to demonstrate the
diversity of Asian

00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:19.820
and Pacific Americans as a whole.

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:24.190 position:56%
Most significantly, we take the
opportunity to highlight and reflect

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:28.140
on the many ways the Asian and
Pacific Island heritage, culture

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:32.930
and achievements have enriched
this nation and continue to do so.

00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:34.600
We have a few more upcoming Asian

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:40.290 position:56%
and Pacific American Heritage events
this month and going into June

00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:43.280
and we invite you and
encourage you to attend them.

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:49.430
On May 16th there's a showing of
a photographic epilogue entitled

00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:51.510
"On Becoming New Americans."

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:56.000
And this is a pictorial
documentation of the transference

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.100
of Indo-Chinese refugees from
Southeast Asia to their entry

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:03.860
into the U.S. by photographer
Paul Tanedo.

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:06.480
This will take place in
the Pickford Theater.

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:09.490
On May 23rd, there
will be another film.

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:11.870
This one is an Indian
film called "Firecracker"

00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:15.110
about family traditions
in South Asian culture,

00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:17.000
also in the Pickford Theater.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.780
And then finally on June 14th
there will be a violin performance

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:23.640 position:56%
by Stephen Shay in the Mumford Room.

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:27.220
So, at the back of the
room we have a table

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:31.500
that has some various materials
pulled from the general collections

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:34.150
of the Humanities and
Social Sciences Division.

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:37.610
This is just a small sampling
of the types of items we have

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:40.290
in the Humanities and
Social Sciences Division

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:41.860
and in the general collections.

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:46.750
So we invite you to browse
at the end of the program.

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:50.780
And lastly, please join us
for some light refreshments.

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:54.410
On behalf of LCAAA, LC
Globe and the Humanities

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:57.320
and Social Sciences Division,
thank you again for coming

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:59.500
and please enjoy the
rest of the month.

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:03.930
[applause]

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:07.790
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
