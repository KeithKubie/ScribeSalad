00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:08.399
I've been asked to talk to you today about an essay that I wrote for the New York times

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:09.870
last year which went under a rather dramatic heading.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.699
It was called "Why you will marry the wrong person"

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.640
and perhaps we could just begin

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.729
- we're among friends- by just asking how many of you in the room do feel on balance

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.869
that you have married the wrong person ? I mean, we're among friends

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.399
I mean yeah

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.320
A lady there- couple of people there- five, ten? I'd say 30 people in the room and and so we always have to triple that

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.540
So there's a pretty hefty majority but I'm here to give counsel and to give consolation for this situation

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.500
You know there's a lot of anger around our love lives privately held

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.620
But a lot of us go around feeling quite enraged, angry privately about the way that our love lives have gone

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.460
My task today is to turn that anger into sadness

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:10.140
If we if we manage to turn rage into grief we will have made psychological progress and

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.340
This is that the task today

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.750
What lies behind rage very often is an unusual quality because we tend to think that very angry people are

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:24.179
sort of dark and pessimistic characters absolutely not. Scratch the surface of any

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.680
regularly angry person and you will find a wild optimist. It is in fact hope that drives rage

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.580
Think of a person who screams every time they can't find their house keys or every time they get stuck in traffic

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.500
These unfortunate characters are evincing a curious

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.300
but reckless faith in a world in which keys never go astray, the roads are mysteriously traffic free

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:52.540
It is hope that is turbocharging their rage. So if we're to get a little bit less sad

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.619
And as a little less angry about our love lives, we will have to diminish some of our hopes

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:06.539
It's very hard to diminish hope around love because there are vast industries designed to inflate our expectations of love

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.080
There was wonderful quote from the German Philosopher, Theodor adorno

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.559
Who in the 1960s said that the most dangerous man in America

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:21.559
was Walt Disney and the reason for his attack on Walt was because he believed that Walt was the prime agent of hope and

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.439
therefore of rage and therefore of bitterness

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:29.269
And he thought that it was the task of philosophy to let us down

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:36.078
gently, which is what I'm going to be doing today. So remember the theme of the talk why you will marry the wrong person

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.150
There are a number of reasons

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.840
why this is going to happen to you, or has maybe already in the privacy of your heart happen to you.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.299
I should say that it's not that bad and the reason is that all of us

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:50.719
Will not manage to find the right person

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.188
But we will probably all of us manage to find a good enough person

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.799
So and that's success

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:04.339
as you will come to see. One of the reasons why we're not going to be able to pull this one off as

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:07.369
Successfully as we might have hoped at the early the outset of our

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.189
Upper teenage perd when we were contemplating love is that we are very strange. I'm very strange, and you're very strange

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:18.948
You don't let on and you know we're not going to do anything very dangerous, but we are basically psyChologically quite strange

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:26.090
we don't normally know very much about this strangeness it takes us a long time before we're really on top of

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:32.179
The way in which we are hard to live with. Is there anyone in this room think that. They're quite easy to live with

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:37.489
On balance yeah, oh my goodness. Okay? I don't want to be rude, but please come and see me afterwards. I know

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:44.870
I know that you're not easy to live with and the reason is that you're a homo sapiens and therefore you are not easy to

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.870
live with no one is. And

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:53.779
But there's a there's a wall of silence that surrounds us from a deeper acquaintance with what is actually so difficult about us

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.769
Our friends don't want to tell us why would they bother? They just want to pleasant evening out.

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:03.438
they're not.. our friends know more about us and more about our flaws probably after a ten minutes acquaintance a

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:08.358
Stranger will know more about your flaws then you might learn over 40 years of life on the planet

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:14.179
Our capacity to intuit what is wrong with us is very weak. Our parents don't tell us very much

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.500
Why would they? they love us too much, they know they can see of course I mean they followed us from the crib

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.759
They know what's wrong with us

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:25.278
They're not going to tell us because they they just want to be sweet. Our ex-lovers a vital source of knowledge

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:27.289
They know. Absolutely. They know

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.809
But you remember that speech that they gave it was it was moving at the time when they said that they wanted a little more

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.640
Space and were attracted to travel and were interested in the culture of Southeast Asia, nonsense!

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.800
They thought lots of things are wrong with you

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.259
But they weren't going to bother to tell you they were just off out of there

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.189
Why would they bother? So there's knowledge that is out there is not in you.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.120
It's out there, but it's not in you and so therefore we progress through the world with a very

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.330
Low sense of what is actually wrong with us

00:04:53.730 --> 00:05:00.319
Not least all of us addicts almost all of us are addicts not injecting heroin as such but addicts in the sense we need to

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:07.819
Redefine what addiction is I like to define addiction not in terms of the substance you're taking in other words. I'm heroin addict

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.820
I'm a cocaine addict no

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:17.329
Addiction is basically any pattern of behavior whereby you cannot stand to be with yourself and certain of the more uncomfortable

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.919
thoughts and more importantly emotions that come from being on your own and

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.599
So therefore you can be addicted to almost anything so long as it keeps you away from yourself

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.920
so it was it keeps you away from tricky self-knowledge and most of us are addicts and

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.219
thanks to all sorts of technologies and

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:41.269
Distractions Etc we can have a good life where we will almost certainly be guaranteed not to spend any time with ourselves.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:47.900
Except maybe for certain kind of airlines that still don't have the gadgets to distract us, but otherwise you can be guaranteed

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.250
You don't have to talk to yourself

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:56.720
And this is a disaster for your capacity to have a relationship with another person because until you know yourself, you can't properly relate to

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.300
another person

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.290
One of the reasons why love is so tricky for us is that it requires us to do something

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:10.099
We really don't want to do which is to approach another human being and say I need you. I wouldn't really survive without you

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.100
I'm vulnerable before you and

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:17.449
There's a very strong impulse in all of us to be strong and to be well defended and not to reveal our

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.579
vulnerability to another person psycho

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:26.150
Psychologists talk of two patterns of response that tend to crop up in people whenever there's a danger of needing to be extremely vulnerable

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.999
Dangerously vulnerable and exposed to another person the first response is to get what what?

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:33.870
psychologists call

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.610
anxiously attached

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:36.980
Attachment theory some of you may know

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.550
So when you are anxiously attached to somebody rather than saying I need you,

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.360
I depend on you you start to get very procedural you say you're ten minutes late

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.369
Or I think the bin bags need to be taken out or you start to get strict when actually what you want to do is

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:54.870
To ask a very poignant question do you still care about me, but we don't dare to ask that question

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:57.390
So instead we get nasty we get stiff

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:03.689
We get procedural the other thing the other pattern of behavior which pSychologists have identified and it tends to apply to people who?

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:11.369
Are in this room in other words a types very outgoing types strivers you become in relationships?

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.010
Tell me if I'm wrong you become what is known as avoidant

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:18.989
Which means that when you when you need someone it's precisely at that moment you pretend you don't

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.589
When you feel most vulnerable you say, I'm quite busy at the moment. I'm fine. Thanks

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:24.869
I'm well busy today in other words

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:30.899
you don't reveal the need for another person which sets them off into a chain of wandering whether

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.590
You are to be trusted, and there's been a cycle of low trust

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:40.140
So we get into these patterns of not daring to do the thing that we really need to do which is to say even though

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:44.399
I'm a growing person maybe I've got a beard maybe I've been alive for a long time. I'm 6 foot 2 ETC

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:49.980
I'm actually a small child inside, and I need you like a small child would need its parent

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:54.899
this is so humbling that most of us refuse to make that step and therefore refuse the challenge of

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.170
Of love um in short

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:02.309
we don't know very much how to love we and it sounds very odd because

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:06.960
Actually somebody said you look all of us probably in this room would probably need to go to a school of love

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.899
What? A school of love? love is just an instinct! No.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:12.870
It's not. It's a skill and it's a skill that needs to be learned

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:16.320
And it's a skill that our society refuses to consider as a skill

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:21.960
We are meant to always just follow our feelings if you keep following your feelings you will almost certainly make a big mistake

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:27.960
In your life. What is love? Ultimately love I believe is something personal

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.110
there's a distinction between

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:35.490
Loving and being loved. We all start off in life by knowing a lot about being loved being loved is the fun bit

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:39.539
That's when somebody brings you something on a tray and ask you how your day at school went etcetera

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:43.979
And we grow up thinking that that is what's going to happen in an adult relationship. We can be forgiven for that

00:08:43.979 --> 00:08:45.370
It's an understandable mistake

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:47.040
But it's a very tragic mistake

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.490
And it leads us not to pay attention to the other side of the equation

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:56.669
Which is to love and what does it really mean to love - love ultimately is to have the willingness to

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:03.420
Interpret someone's on the surface not very appealing behavior in order to find more Benevolent reasons

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:09.450
why it may be unfolding in other words to love someone is to apply charity and generosity of

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:16.979
Interpretation most of us are in dire need of love because actually we need to be we need to have some slack cut for us

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:23.819
Because our behavior is often so tricky that if we don't do this we wouldn't get through any kind of relationship

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:30.119
But we're not used to thinking that that is the core of what love is. Core of what love is is the willingness to

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:32.370
Interpret another's behavior

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.849
What we tend to be very bad at is

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:42.810
Recognizing that anyone that we can love is going to be a perplexing mixture of the good and the bad there's a wonderful

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:51.749
psychoanalyst called Melanie Klein who was active in the 50s and 60s recently from Vienna active in North London studying how children learned about relationships

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:53.800
from the parental

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.800
Situation and she came up with a very fascinating

00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:01.349
Analysis, she argued that when children are small very small

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:06.330
They don't really realize that a parent is one character

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:12.359
they actually do what she calls split a parent into a good parent and a bad parent and so this is when a

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:14.400
Baby is in a really an infant stage

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:19.109
so what you do is you split into the good mother or and the bad mother and

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:22.859
It takes a long long time melanie Klien thought it might be until you're four

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:29.340
Until you actually realize that the good and the bad mother are one person and you become ambivalent in other words

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:34.979
You become able to hate someone and really go off them and at the same time also love them

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.620
And you're able not to run away from that situation

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:38.160
You're able to say

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.299
I love someone and hate them and that's okay and melanie Klein thought

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:48.270
This is an immense psychological achievement when we can no longer merely divide people into absolutely Brilliant perfect

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:51.030
What marvelous and hateful, let-me-down,

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:58.890
Disappointed me everyone who we love is going to disappoint as we start off with idealization and we end up often with denigration

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:02.700
The person goes from being absolutely marvelous to be absolutely terrible

00:11:03.339 --> 00:11:05.669
Maturity is the ability to see that there are no heroes or sinners

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:12.219
really among human beings that all of us and this wonderfully perplexing mixture of the good and the bad and

00:11:12.589 --> 00:11:17.049
Adulthood true psychological Maturity and may need to be 65 before it hits you

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:23.200
I'm not there yet is the capacity to realize that anyone that you love is going to be this mixture of

00:11:24.589 --> 00:11:28.328
The good and the bad, so love is not just admiration for strength

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:32.859
it is also tolerance for weakness and recognition of ambivalence and

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.890
the reason why we're going to

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:42.519
Probably make some real mistakes when we choose our love partners some of you in this room have made some stunning mistakes now

00:11:42.519 --> 00:11:50.049
Why is this? The reason is that we've been told that the way to find a good partner is to follow your instinct

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:55.659
Right follow your heart. That's the Mantra, and so we're all the time reminded that if we stop

00:11:56.329 --> 00:12:02.619
Reasoning analyzing other people in this room who think that you can think too much about your emotions

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.250
And that sort of you people get yeah, you can think too much a few people okay?

00:12:06.279 --> 00:12:09.338
You can't think too much you can only ever think badly

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.969
But there's no such thing as thinking too much about emotions

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:19.750
but the problem is we live in a romantic culture that privileges impulse and when it comes to love something tricky occurs because

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:25.360
You don't have to be a paid-up believer in psychotherapy of psychoanalysis to realize that the way

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:32.949
We love as adults sits on top of our early childhood experiences and in early childhood the way that we learnt about love

00:12:33.199 --> 00:12:37.959
Was not just via experiences of tenderness and kindness and generosity

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:42.190
The love that we will have tasted as children will also be bound up with

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:47.409
experiences of being let down being humiliated maybe being with a parent who

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:52.779
Treated us very harshly who scolded us who made us feel small in some way in other words

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.880
Quite a lot about our early experiences of love a bound up with various kinds of suffering

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:03.489
Now something quite bad happens when we start to go out into the adult world and start to choose loved partners

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:07.060
We think we're out to find partners who will make us happy

00:13:07.579 --> 00:13:14.379
but we're not. We're out to find partners who will feel familiar, and that may be a very different thing because

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:18.010
Familiarity may be bound up with particular kinds of torture

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:24.299
This explains why sometimes people will say to us. There's a wonderful person. You should go and date them

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:29.310
they're good-looking that charming there are all sorts of things and we go out with them when we date them and

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:31.470
We do recognize that

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:35.310
They're really wonderful and amazing but we have to confess to our partners

00:13:35.589 --> 00:13:40.649
To our friends that actually we found this person- often we struggle with the vocabulary- we say

00:13:41.529 --> 00:13:45.899
Maybe not that exciting or maybe not sexy or a bit boring..

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.919
But really what we mean is that we've detected in this really quite accomplished person

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.190
someone who will not be able to make a

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:59.400
Suffer in the way that we need to suffer in order to feel that love is real, and that's why we reject them

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.889
So we are not merely on a quest to be happy

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:06.059
We are on a quest to suffer in ways that feel familiar and this

00:14:06.339 --> 00:14:09.419
Radically undermines our capacity to find a good partner

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:12.449
Here's another reason. Why we're going to come unstuck in the field of love

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:17.669
We tend to believe that the more a lover is right for us the less we're going to have to explain

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:25.380
About who we are how we feel what upsets us what we want we believe rather as a young child believes of its parent

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:32.010
That a true lover will guess what is in our minds one of the great errors that human beings make it's permanently to feel

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:38.879
That other people know what's in their minds without us having said what's in our minds. It's very cumbersome to use words

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:45.150
It's such a bore and when it comes to love we have this deep desire that we'll simply be understood wordlessly

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.820
It's touching it's a beautiful romantic idea

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:54.929
But it also leads to a catastrophic outbreak of sulking and what is sulking? Sulking is an interesting phenomenon

00:14:54.930 --> 00:15:00.210
we don't just sulk with anyone we sulk with people who we feel should understand us and

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:03.060
yet for some reason had decided not to and

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:08.520
that's why we tend to reserve our sulks for people who we love and who we think love us and

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:11.070
They tell us something you know they

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:16.650
Unwittingly will trigger a negative reaction in us and we'll sulk and they'll say what's wrong with you darling

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:20.699
And we'll say nothing and they'll say but come on. You're upset and we'll go no. I'm not

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:26.069
I'm absolutely fine, and it's not true, and we'll go upstairs and we'll shut the door, and we won't tell them

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:31.080
What's wrong with us, and then they'll knock at the door and that's it. Please just tell me and we'll say no

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.640
Because we want them to read our souls

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:39.739
Because we expect that a true lover can understand what we feel and who we are without us speaking

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:45.620
This is a catastrophe for our capacity to form lasting relationships. If you do not explain

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:51.920
You can never be understood. The route to a good marriage and to good love is the ability to become a good teacher

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:58.939
Now teaching sounds like a narrow profession those guys in tweed jackets and fusty with it with a chalkboard Etc

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:04.369
I'm not talking about that kind of teaching. All of us whatever our job aspirations, whatever it is

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:05.490
We do have to

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:12.620
Become teachers. Now, teaching is merely the word that we give to the skill of getting an idea from one head into another

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:15.260
in a way that it's likely to be accepted and

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:22.369
Most of us are appalling teachers most of us teach when we're tired when we're frightened. What are we frightened of? We're frightened

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:26.030
We've married an idiot and because we're so frightened. We start screaming at them

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:32.869
You've got to understand and the thing is that unfortunately by the time you've started to humiliate the person you want to understand something less

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:38.000
And over you will never get anyone to understand what you want them to understand so long as you make them feel

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:44.390
Small in order to teach well you need to be relaxed you need to accept that maybe your partner won't understand

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:47.540
And also you need a culture within a couple

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:54.199
That two people are going to need to teach each other and therefore also learn from one another and this brings me to the next

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:59.600
reason why you're going to have a very unhappy relationship probably and that is because you probably believe

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:05.449
That when somebody tries to tell you something about yourself that's a little ticklish and a little uncomfortable. They are attacking you

00:17:05.449 --> 00:17:07.999
They're not. They're trying to make you into a better person

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.609
And we don't tend to believe that this has a role in love. We tend to believe that true

00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:18.589
Love means accepting the whole of us. It doesn't no one should accept the whole of us

00:17:18.589 --> 00:17:21.169
We're appalling really one of the whole of you accepted

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:22.860
No
That's not love that

00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:24.690
the full display of our

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:30.469
Characters the full articulation of who we are should not be something that we do in front of anyone that we care about

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:32.880
So what we need to do

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:40.310
Is is to accept that the other person is going to want to educate us and that it isn't a criticism Criticism is

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:44.629
Merely the wrong word that we apply to a much noble idea

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:49.849
Which is to try and make us into better versions of ourselves, but we tend to reject this idea

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.640
very strongly

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:57.679
Is there any hope? Of course there's hope! Look I mentioned the word good enough?

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:01.159
It's a phrase taken from a wonderful English pSYchoanalyst called Donald, Winnicott

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:05.599
He had a lot of parents who would come to him and say things like I'm so worried

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:11.360
I'm not a good parent my child has this problem, or that problem ETC, and he came up with a wonderful phrase

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:19.309
He said you are most likely to be a good enough parent and it's a relief from our otherwise punishing

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:24.169
Perfectionism the good thing is that none of us are perfect and therefore we don't need

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:27.979
Perfection and the demand for Perfection will lead you to only one thing

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:35.180
Loneliness. You cannot have perfection and company. To be in company with another person is to be negotiating

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:37.670
imperfection every day

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:43.819
Incompatibility- we are all incompatible, but it is the work of love to make us

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:48.470
graciously accommodate each other and ourselves to each other's incompatibilities and

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:55.339
Therefore compatibility is an achievement of love. It. Isn't what you need from the outset of course you're not going to be totally compatible

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:59.450
That's not the point it is through love that you gradually accept the need

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:05.959
To be compatible um we probably can't change our types? Right, so all of us a problem

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:12.350
Many of us are have got types who are going to cause us real problems. They may be too distant there may be arrogant

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:15.440
They're going to torture us in some way now friends

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.739
Casually say to us chuck them get out the relationship ETC, right?

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:23.240
No, I don't you know we're realists here at Google, and I'm giving you realistic advice

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.280
You're not going to manage to change your type

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:31.279
Let's get that for granted what you can do, and this is a big achievement is to change how you

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:34.550
characteristically respond to your tricky type

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:40.370
Most of us have formed the way that we respond to tricky types in early childhood

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:46.670
so we had a distant parent with mattres and a distant lover when we were very young we responded to that distant parent by

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:52.520
Attention-seeking we rattled and banged an our adult we rattle and bang in our own way, and we think that's going to help

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.150
it doesn't it create a

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:56.839
Cycle that's going to be a vicious cycle

00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:01.610
It's not going to get us anywhere it is open to us at any time to have a more mature

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:03.539
response to the

00:20:03.539 --> 00:20:09.949
challenges that the types of people were attracted to are going to pose for us and that is an immense step forward and Immense achievement

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:15.380
Um the other thing we should do is recognize the nobility of compromise

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:20.030
What are the most shameful things to ever have to admit is to say this is my partner.

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:26.749
I've compromised in choosing them. I've compromised. Oh, why have you compromised? Well? I'm not that attractive myself. I've got lots of problems

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:32.390
I'm a bit nutty frankly. I couldn't pull anyone better, but they're very nice okay now you would think loser

00:20:32.549 --> 00:20:37.339
It's not true compromise is Noble. We compromise in every area of life

00:20:37.409 --> 00:20:41.989
There's no reason why we shouldn't compromise in our love life. Maybe we're sticking around for the children

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:46.520
Good it was a "Oh!, they're only sticking around for the children." That's a wonderful reason to stick around

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.760
Why else are you Gonna stick around?

00:20:48.929 --> 00:20:53.298
So let's look a bit more benevolently at the art of compromise

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:59.539
It's a massive achievement in love I'm going to end with with a quote from one of my favorite philosophers

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:07.189
Danish nineteenth-century very Gloomy philosopher called Kierkegaard and Kierkegaard in his book either all had a wonderful

00:21:07.799 --> 00:21:15.319
Outburst what he basically said of course you're going to marry the wrong person and make the wrong decisions in a whole row of

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:20.480
Areas and the reason you're going to do this is that you're human therefore. Do not berate yourself for doing

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:24.469
What humans do this is what he says marry, and you will regret it

00:21:24.539 --> 00:21:31.369
Don't marry you will also regret it marry, or don't marry you will get it either way laughs of the world's foolishness

00:21:31.409 --> 00:21:37.189
You'll regret it weep over it you'll regret that to laugh at the world's foolishness or weep over it

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:40.730
You will regret both hang yourself. You will regret it

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:45.110
Don't hang yourself you will regret that to hang yourself or don't hang yourself

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:52.819
You'll regret it either way whether you hang yourself or don't hang yourself you will regret both this gentleman is the essence of all

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:55.340
