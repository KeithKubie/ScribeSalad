from the University of
California, Berkeley.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.860
His dissertation which forms the
basis of this talk today focuses

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:40.830 position:56%
on the literary culture and debates
across Iran, Central and South Asia,

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.150
in the 18th and 19th Century
and their implications

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.300

by the International Society

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:05.620
of Iranian studies awarded this
past August in Vienna, Austria.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.750
On a personal note, Kevin has
been here for the past seven,

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.670
eight, maybe longer years.

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.730 position:56%
He's been coming for years and using
our materials here in the African

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:16.250
and Middle Eastern division.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.010
Both are rare Persian materials,
contemporary Persian materials,

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:23.170
literature and the
Asian division as well.

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:26.950
He has unearth so many wonderful
Persian materials from Indian

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.650
and the sub-continent that
are in the Asian division

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.650
and the microfilm,
microfiche format.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.750
So I'm really delighted that he's
a Kluge here for eleven months.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:39.720 position:56%
We will benefit from his work at the
library and it will help us better

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.800
and better understand our
own collections in many ways.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.510
Kevin it's a delight to
have you, [inaudible].

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:52.180
[ Applause ]

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.480
Kevin Schwartz:

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.780
&gt;&gt; Great, well thank
you so much Hirad

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.080
for that very kind introduction.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.690
Thank you, Professor Karamustafa
and the Roshan Institute,

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:03.880
to Mary Jane Deep as well and just
to return the compliment to Hirad.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.490
I am just thrilled to be here
and so honored having spent,

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.990
I don't want to say eight
years, but long enough

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.020
at the desk here listening
to some talks

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.320
and working on my dissertation.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.140
So it's nice to be, an
honor to be on this side

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.470
of the podium, so thank you.

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:26.220
My talk today is based on
my dissertation research

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.610
and it's called, "Return of the
Masters, Connections, Contestations

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:31.980
and the Redrawing of
Persian Literary History".

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.090
And I'm going to give a
kind of world wind tour

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:38.820
into Persian literary culture in
the 18th and 19th Century and try

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.480
to tell you how I think about
Persian literary history and some

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:47.040 position:56%
of the gaps in its writing and as
well as some of the stakes involved.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.650
Now if I could do just
one thing today,

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:53.060
that would be to really
impart upon you a basic idea.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:56.600
And that is that Persian
literary history as written,

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.360
particularly when it
comes to the 18th

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.740
and 19th Century is insufficient.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:04.580
It's insufficient because in
the 18th and 19th Century,

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:08.600
Persian literary writing is
unable to account for trends

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.230
and multiple literary phenomena
occurring outside of Iran.

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:16.020
So Persia was this great,
prevalent, prodigious social,

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:20.360
linguistic cultural idiom that
connected Sufis travelers,

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.850
[inaudible] and Sultans from
Anatolia to Western China.

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:27.040
And we hear about this
in the development

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.010
of Persian literary history
but suddenly in the 18th

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:32.670
and 19th Century, we lose these
kinds of trends regional scope

00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:35.820
and suddenly the story of
Persian literary history becomes

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.260
Iran's story.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.310
And to put it more bluntly,
Persian literary history

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:42.840
at this period is Iranian
literary history.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.980
So Persian literary history
has been infused with some kind

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.960
of national sentimentality
stemming from Iran.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.770
And I think actually we
can pinpoint the idea,

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:55.390
the point at which this idea

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:58.830
of Iranian nationalists
sentimentality interjected

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:02.160
or intervened in the writing
of Persian literary history

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.500 position:56%
and that's an idea that's called
Bazgasht-i Adabi or Literary Return.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.860
And I'll talk about in more detail
in a moment, but I just wanted

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.850 position:56%
to kind of mention this because it's
a framework I'm working with today

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:15.010
and also kind of working against.

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:18.910
And this idea is that in
the 18th and 19th Century,

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:22.830
Iranian poets rescued Persian
poetry from despair by returning

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.270
to the styles of the Masters.

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:27.690
So they returned to the styles
of the classical Masters

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:30.440
that were prevalent to the
9th and the 15th Century.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.180
They returned to their
glorious and simple prose.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:36.900
And they did so by moving away
from this stagnant literary style

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.710
that we're told was
occurring and being written

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:44.140
and produced throughout Central
and South Asia and elsewhere

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.570
but crucially not in Iran.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:49.940
So there it is, Iranian poets
in the 18th and 19th Century,

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.120
they somehow divide
themselves, they reconnect

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:55.550
with the Masters while
others elsewhere do not.

00:09:55.550 --> 00:10:01.100
They remain kind of stagnating in
this decadent literary culture.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:04.560
Now there's some major impacts of
this idea, there's a lot of kind

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.740
of historiographical
debris in its wake.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:11.270
One thing I already alluded to
was the conflation of Iranian

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:12.840
and Persian literary history.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.480
I mean suddenly the
story in the 18th

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:19.300
and 19th Century is not this kind
of cosmopolitan macro level view

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:20.600
of Persian literary history.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:26.160
But it's focusing slowly or
exclusively rather on Iran.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.130
The second thing that happens is

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:31.920
that there's a greater proprietary
right over the Masters in Iran.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:37.430
So these great Masters like Rumi,
Hafiz, Ferdowsi who were productive

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:42.760
in the 9th to 15th Century are
the ones in which Iranian poets

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.950
and only Iranian poets
are reconnecting with.

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:48.490
And so if we're told that
Iranian poets are reconnecting

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:53.090
with are re-finding these
Masters while others are not,

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:54.390
well that asserts a kind

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:59.460
of more proprietary right
by Iran at this time.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:01.970
The second, the third
thing rather it does it

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:04.940
that it erases other facets
of Persian literary culture.

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:07.930 position:56%
I mean again, we're told by this
narrative that the important element

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:10.940
of Persian literary history in
the 18th and 19th Century is

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:12.870
that these few Iranian
poets connected

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:17.820
with the Masters while the rest of
the world kind of remains decadent

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:19.930
in their negative literary ways.

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:21.630
And so again, that
erases a lot of kind

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:25.010
of multiple literary phenomena
occurring at the time.

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:27.050
And towards the end of my
talk, I'll point other things

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:30.660
that are happening around
this time outside of Iran

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:35.040
which I think are a
integral part of this story.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:38.660
So I'm going to break my
talk into three parts.

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.880
First I'll at how this narrative
of return Bazgasht became

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:45.580
to be fashion, what it entails,
what are the stakes involved.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.290
Second, I'm going to look
at the poets themselves.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:48.820
Who were these Bazgasht poet's?

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.910
Because there were poets
that actually existed in 18th

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:55.020
and 19th Century Isfahan,
Tehran and greater Iran

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:57.060
who sought return the
styles of the Masters.

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.450
But as you will see
they didn't exactly do

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:01.320
so in the way they were told.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:05.100
And finally, I'll look at some
kind of other literary phenomena

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.450
or literary communities
occurring outside of Iran.

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:11.840
Again, just to give you an idea
of what's happening outside

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.260
of this kind of tantalizing,
dominant narrative

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.620
that we'll turn to right now.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:21.670
So first, what is this
idea of Bazgasht?

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:23.420
How did it come to be?

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:25.390
Well the classification of
Persian literary history

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:27.830
and its development,
particularly now we're talking

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:31.430
about poetry can be traced back
to this man, Muhammad Taqi Bahar

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:35.510
who died in 1951, a great poet
and literary historian of Iran.

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:38.220
And what he does is he
divides the development

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.400
of Persian literary
culture, particularly poetry

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.470
into four schools or styles each

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:46.800
with its own literary
characteristics

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.530
and roughly corresponding to
different periods in history.

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:52.360
So you have the Khurasani
School, the Iraqi School,

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.900
the Indian style and
Literary Return.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.920
Now which period is given a name?

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:01.900 position:56%
It maintains a core set of stylistic
attributes and is affiliated

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:03.560
with a different temple or period.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.940
And even Bahar recognizes
that there's some slippage

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:09.830
between these terms, but as far
as talking about the core elements

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:13.740
of development over a period of
time he does a fairly good job

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:17.440
in distinguishing between say
the Khurasani School which tends

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:21.060
to be located at the core of the
praise of a patron, deals very kind

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:25.440 position:56%
of naturalistically, talks about the
hunt and feasting and merrymaking.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:29.760
And praise the patrons
of beneficence and glory

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.570
versus the Iraqi School which
tends to be the poetry associated

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:35.330
with Hafiz and Rumi and
is more inward looking,

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:38.970
more mystical which Bahar and
others would say kind of stems

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:42.590
from destructive practices
of the monguls leading

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:46.080
into a more introspective
type of poetry production.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:50.160
The Indian style which we'll talk
about in just a moment is known

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.570
for its intellectualism, its
mannerism, its abstract acrobatics,

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:56.890
it's complicated metaphors.

00:13:56.890 --> 00:14:00.840
And then finally, Literary Return
is already mentioned is referencing

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:04.830 position:56%
this group of Iranian poets and is
exclusively Iranian poets who sought

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:06.870
to return to the simple
ways of the Masters.

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:12.110
So we sought the return back to
poetry Ferdowsi, Sadi and Hafiz,

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:16.570
those poets of the
Khurasani and Iraqi school.

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:19.120
So what if I was interested when
I first kind of looked at this

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.870
and settled my dissertation
topic was there's a clear kind

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:25.640
of delineation between
the first three categories

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.210
and the last category.

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:30.020
So the first three categories,
they speak to the geographic,

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:32.930
expansiveness of the
Persianate world.

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:35.780
They speak to trends happening
in South Asia and Iran

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:37.750
and Central Asia and elsewhere.

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:39.880
But when we get to
the fourth category,

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.910
there's a delimiting
quality around geography.

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:45.580
The fourth category
refers to Iran alone.

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.010
So you see there's
a kind of whittling

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:51.270
down of Persian literary
history reaching its apex,

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:52.950
not elsewhere in the
Persianate world,

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:54.410
not across the Persianate world,

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:56.830
but solely in 18th
and 19th Century Iran.

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:58.680
So I found this kind
of very fascinating

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.480
and what was the reason behind it

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.160
and really testing
whether it was true or not.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.170
So as I noted there you have
the first three categories

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:10.960
that referred the Persianate world
while the fourth category refers

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:16.370 position:56%
to Iran alone, just that small group
of poets who decided to return back

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:18.890 position:56%
to the simple styles of the Masters.

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:21.770
Well of course, if the returning
back to the simple styles

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:25.200 position:56%
of the Masters, the question is what
are they returning from and Bahar

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.720
and others are very clear on this.

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:31.500
What necessitated such a
return was the Indian style.

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:34.990
According to Bahar and
others, it was this abstract

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:37.600
and complicated style and this
argued that the Indian style

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.910
which prevailed across Central

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:42.450
and South Asia was causing
the downfall of Persian.

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:44.490
And what they needed
was a simpler style,

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:47.110
so poets in Iran rectified
this course.

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:49.880
But crucially by returning
to the Masters in Iran,

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.870
other poets did not,
they remained mired

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:53.610
in this stagnant literary culture.

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:56.330 position:56%
And just as an aside here, this idea

00:15:56.330 --> 00:16:00.640
of the Indian style is now
very much being interrogated,

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.480
undermined and overturned.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.270
Because you can see
it's quite a kind

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:10.750
of inappropriate style associated
with this kind of geoethnic moniker

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:15.100 position:56%
of Indian with the stagnation and
decline of Persian literary history.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:18.250
So people have offered up
other names for this kind

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:22.880
of prevalent style, tazah-gui and
others, Safavid Isfahani poetry.

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:24.570
But for now I'm just
referring it to this kind

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:27.190
of historiographical
category that Bahar does.

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:28.970
And for Bahar, he was very clear.

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:32.970 position:56%
This was his overly complicated
style that really was causing a kind

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:35.120
of negative and detrimental impact

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:39.260
on the development
of Persian poetry.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:43.400
And he notes in here, here's a bit
by him, translated by [inaudible].

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:47.590
The Indian style possessed
novelty but had very many failings.

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.140
It was affirm and spineless.

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:50.450
Its ideas were feeble.

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:52.080
It's imagery odd.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:55.130
The poems were crowded with
ideas but unattractive,

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:56.610
they were wanting in eloquence.

00:16:56.610 --> 00:17:02.770
So it's quite clear about what the
mandate of the Indian style was.

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:06.590
Unless you think I'm just I'm just
unfairly kind of pillaring, Bahar,

00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:08.710
it's important to note
that this impression

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:11.530
of the Indian style was
kind of mimic and replicated

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:14.850
by quite a few scholars until
fairly recently so we can look

00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:20.380 position:56%
at fabulous scholars like Jiri Becka
and Annemarie Schimmel who adhere

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:22.950
to more or less the same
argument that Bahar does

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:24.250
in regards to Indian style.

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:27.540
Becka saying, the Indian
style led to quote attempts

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:31.890 position:56%
to originality supported on two
narrow a foundation to the grotesque

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:33.560
to a lack of good taste and unity.

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:37.590
And the great Annemarie Schimmel
and Islamic literatures of India,

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:41.180
Persian literature in India ended
in the autumnal hopelessness

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:46.430
of bizarre expression, so not
too positive and appraisal

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:49.310
by other of those scholars.

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:51.110
What's really interesting
is that this kind

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:55.060
of juxtaposition the position
between literary return

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:58.870
and Indian style or simple poetry

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:02.440
and complicated poetry can actually
be found in earlier writings.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:07.130 position:56%
You can actually go back to writings
of the 19th Century in Tazkirahs,

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:08.840
these great commemorative texts

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:12.630
that include biographical
information and aversive poets.

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:15.590
And you can find this same kind
of juxtaposition, this same kind

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:19.580
of tension between a
simple style on the one hand

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:22.480
and a complicated style
on the other hand.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:27.000
And here is a Riza Quli Khan, a
great statesman, diplomat, traveler

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.610
and scholar of the quote of
[inaudible] and he's writing

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:37.300
in the kind of greatest [inaudible]
Tazkirah in 1850, Majma' al-fusaha

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:40.190
and here you can see that
he has the distaste for kind

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:44.190
of one complicated style which
would come to carry all the weight

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:47.730 position:56%
of the Indian style that Bahar would
place upon it and the championing

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:51.450
of a group of poets who
rescued poetry in Iran.

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:55.160 position:56%
So again, Hidayat here, he doesn't
have the terminology that Bahar kind

00:18:55.160 --> 00:19:00.630 position:56%
of co-defies later on, but he's
making the same kind of observations

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:02.360
in regards to poetic practice.

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:06.260
And here he says during the
Turkmanian Safavid period

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.870
reproachable methods
became manifest.

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:11.300
The well considered manner
of writing a splendid ode

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:15.440
and eloquent method of composing
writings on admonition, advice,

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.690
governance, pious devotions
and epics which were the custom

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:22.000
of our proceeding writers
were entirely supplanted.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.500
Reversifiers became
inclined toward the outlining

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:27.500
of riddles the conjuring
up misnomers

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:31.450
and now here's the Indian style
poets, they established a style

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:35.560
of confused speech, idle prattle
and vain oratory after a manner

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:38.460
of sickly dispositions
and indirect style.

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:42.470
The ascendants starved this
people, poets fortune was the cause

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:46.170
of the setting star of excellence,
wisdom, eloquence, rhetoric,

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:48.010
philosophy and knowledge.

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:51.320
And now finally we get to these
revivers of the glory days

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:55.290
of Persian poetry, the return
poets but several people settled

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:57.850
on the restoration of
the old Masters method.

00:19:57.850 --> 00:20:01.050
They became aware of the
tastelessness of the modern style

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:02.350
and their contemptable fashion.

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:07.340
They struggle to the upmost limit
and down the road of earnest strive

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:10.780
and forbade other people from their
approachable style of the moderns.

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:14.030
They became inclined with the
pleasant style of the old masters

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:15.510 position:56%
so it says, Hidayat and [inaudible].

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:20.360
You can really hear the
echoes of Bahar who's writing

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:25.220
in the next century as far as kind
of codifying this narrative Iran

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:28.650 position:56%
on one hand and everyone else on the
other or a simple style with poetry

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:30.540
and everyone else on the other.

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:33.030
And thank you for going through
that whole quote with me,

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:36.790 position:56%
but I really do think it's important
to kind of return these sources.

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:38.320
Because I think if you
return to these sources,

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:42.810
even going further back than
Majma' al-fusaha in 1860,

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:46.890
you begin to hear a different
story, you begin to get the traces

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:50.370
of a different kind of narrative
that I help explains what's going

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:52.940
on with these return
poets, what was happening

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:56.130
to Persian poetic culture in Iran.

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:58.890
And there are I think
elements of this story

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:00.190
that have been edited out.

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:03.540
So let's kind of see if we can
recover them and this is part 2

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:06.150
and this is looking at the
Bazgasht poets themselves.

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:09.040
And they noted, they were a group
of poets who existed in Isfahan

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:13.150
and later in Tehran who sought to
survive the styles of the Masters.

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:15.630
So what were they doing?

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:17.740
Was it that these poets
were really motivated

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:19.810
by rescuing Persian
poetry from despair?

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:23.450
Were they keeping tabs on how
Persian poetry was being denigrated

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:25.340
in decline across the globe?

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:26.660
And the answer is clearly no

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:31.810
and I think I wouldn't be
here if the answer was yes.

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:35.070
But what we notice with these
poets is they were more in tuned

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:36.640
to their social conditions.

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:40.160
So poets of the late 18th and
early 19th Century Isfahan,

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:43.150
really were seeking to
constitute poetic networks

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:45.030
and reestablished the social value

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:48.170
of poetry following the
downfall of the Safavids.

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:49.870
And why is this important
distinction?

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:53.000
Why is it important that
we go back to sources

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.700
and see how these poets understand
their local social conditions?

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:00.150
Because I think it helps
dislodge some of this kind

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:03.210
of nationalistic parameters
and sentiments

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:06.180
of this grandiose narrative
of Persian literary history.

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:10.320
We're no longer setup with Indian
versus Iranian on the one hand

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:13.410
with some kind of nationalist
competition coursing

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:15.910
through how Persian
literary history was written.

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:18.660
Instead we can go back to
sources and actually kind

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:22.470
of reconstruct what poets
were finding at the time.

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:25.550
And again if you go back to
the Tazkirahs and the poets

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:29.340 position:56%
of these times, the actual Bazgasht
poets, we find that their narrative,

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:32.360
their attitudes for trying to
reestablish the role of poets

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:35.400
in their own society, was something
that was kind of edited out

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:39.780
and alighted in the narrative
of later authors such as Hedayat

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:43.720 position:56%
and Bahar was still kind of
conscious of creating this dichotomy

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:49.410
of between a simple and complicated
style and India and Iran.

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:53.270
So, why was it important
for these Bazgasht poets

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:55.560 position:56%
to reestablish the role of the poet?

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.720
Well first you have to know
something about what was happening

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:00.760
in Safavid times and
in Safavid times,

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.320
poetic culture was situated
in the coffee house.

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:07.400
It served as the epicenter of
productivity, not only in Isfahan

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.970
but also in [inaudible]
and elsewhere in Iran.

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:12.380
You can have informal
literary societies.

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:15.940 position:56%
You could have educational networks
and literary networks forming there.

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:18.450
The coffee house was the epicenter
where people cited their poetry,

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:21.310
had it critiqued, etcetera.

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:24.700
In addition to which Safavid
times you had the institution

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.000
of the court.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.210
Now it wasn't as grandiose in
promoting or giving patronage

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:35.150
to poetry as there, as the moguls
did, for example in South Asia,

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:38.220
but nonetheless it provided
an avenue for people

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:41.680
to receive patronage,
people to produce poetry.

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:46.700
But what happens with the sacking
of Isfahan 1722 and the downfall

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:50.040
of the Safavids is there's
this great dislocation.

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:54.870
And so there's no longer an
avenue to produce poetry,

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:58.360
neither at the coffee
house not at the court.

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:03.690
And just to give a sense of what
was happening to Isfahan in 1722.

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:07.900
Here's a quote from Michael
Axworthy who notes by mid-century,

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:09.680
most of the built up
area of Isfahan,

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:12.480
the former capital was
deserted, inhabited only

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.590
by owls and wild animals.

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:17.480
In the last years of the Safavids
it had been a thriving city

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:22.000
of 550,000 people, one of the
largest cities in the world,

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.600
a similar size to London
at the time or bigger.

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:28.740
By the end of the Siege of 1722,
only 100,000 people were left

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:31.320
and although many citizens
returned thereafter,

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:35.160
the number failure again during
the Afghan occupation and later so,

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:40.300
by 1736, there were
only 50,000 people left.

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:44.830 position:56%
So in such as a disastrous situation
and following the destruction

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:48.140
of Isfahan at the hands of
invaders, it's very kind of easy

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:52.850
to see it would be a poetic
climate that was dislocated.

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:54.940
No longer in a coffee
house to produce poetry,

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:58.100
no longer in the court
to provide patronage

00:24:58.100 --> 00:24:59.680
and the sources bear this out.

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:03.870
So in [inaudible] in poetry
social conditions and its impact

00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:06.680
on what matter first and foremost.

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:11.690
So if you look at a tazkirah from
Arabic that was in the last quarter

00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:16.580
of the 18th Century and often
look back to as the first text

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:19.490
that was kind of championing
this proto-nationalist movement

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:22.970
of return poets.

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:24.550
We see that it was
very much in tuned

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:27.190 position:56%
to the social conditions around him.

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:31.110 position:56%
And he writes, for many years on the
count of the revolution at the time,

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:34.580
I'd onced the customs of poetic
compositions are nullified in poets

00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:38.960
from anguish are changed and the
resolve of poets is corrupted.

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:42.750 position:56%
The scattering of easy circumstances
and the state of confusion are

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:44.190
such that no one is in the state

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:47.420
of reading poetry and
composing poetry."

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:49.560
Notice in that quote, there is
no mention of the Indian style,

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:52.580
there is no mention of a
denigrated style that's kind

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:56.550
of taking the Persianate world by
storm, that's causing its decay.

00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:57.980
But instead he's very much in tuned

00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:00.600
to the social conditions
of his time.

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.750
And this attitude indeed
is confirmed

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:06.180
in the poetry of these
Bazgasht poets.

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:08.800
And here is a selection
of three poets, Azar,

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:11.540
Sabahi and Hatif meeting
in a rose garden.

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:16.010
And they're again discussing in a
social situation, the institution

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:19.400
of the poet and Persian
poetry in Iran at the time.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:22.710
And again, no real mention
of style but more focused

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:25.250
on what opportunities a poet has.

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:27.040
And there's tons of
examples in this,

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:30.150
both in praised poems
and in elegies as well.

00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:34.110
And so Sabahi says, don't you see
how the sacred Homa in this land

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:37.040
and country is worth less
than the hour of misfortune.

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:39.540
There's no buyer of
gems in this domain.

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:42.930
The seller makes no profit
from selling the goods.

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:46.230
After this, may you tune
us, suffer senseless pain.

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:49.280
Don't deliver a spine, a
thine speech for anyone.

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.780
What's the use to put
yourself through such trouble,

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:53.850
just to put a few lines into verse.

00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:55.700
When you begin to recite
it, they will signal

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.910
with their fingers
with the lips to stop.

00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:01.050
And if you prepare something from
pen and paper, they'll value it

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:08.470
as nothing just like this book.

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:13.330
So in the absence of a market of
poetry and the absence of avenues

00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:16.800 position:56%
of patronage and the overall
destruction in the market of speech,

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:19.190
I think these poets did
a very interesting thing

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:20.590
which their poetry bears out.

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:24.490
They turn to one another,
in praise of one another.

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:30.260
And so of course, the panegyric ode
is reminiscent of Kharasani School,

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:33.780
it usually happens the court, it's
usually at the praise of the glory

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:38.220
and beneficence of a Sultan.

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:42.500
But in this case in the absence
of that figure of patronage,

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:47.420
with no ability to achieve
patronage, these poets decided

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:49.800
to reconstitute the
role of the poet.

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.530
They started to reconstitute
their networks but they need to do

00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:54.870
so by praising one another.

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:58.450
And so they solidify their networks
and roles as poets by doing so

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:00.700
and they did so by relying
on the form and style

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:05.880
of those earlier poets that praised
patrons in the form of the ode.

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:09.910 position:56%
And so going back to their poetry,
one finds profound examples of this.

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:13.460 position:56%
Poets would exchange or recite poems
to one another, praising each other

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:15.110
as the master of the age.

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:18.050
Not only with direct reference
to Masters themselves,

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:22.840
but did so in some cases to
direct imitation of their poems.

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.600 position:56%
And here we see a back and forth ode

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.500
of [inaudible] between
Sabahi and Azar.

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:29.410
Not only as a reference
of master like Anvari one

00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:33.380
of these great classical poets but
also is written in the same style

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:36.690
as one of his [inaudible].

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:40.300
Sabahi says, O ye before him
the teacher of knowledge kneels

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:41.930
in deference to learning.

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:45.600
Before you the nod of the Pleiades
and to its need arrangement.

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:49.280
Before you're grander, the
Red Sea spill abundant water.

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:54.570
The sun which is the source of life
performs ablution of your door.

00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:56.130
And as [inaudible] responds,

00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:58.940
your poetry is the knob
opening the Pleiades.

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:01.750
Your prose is the river
stealing the Red Sea.

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:04.290
It appears that Anvari
wrote this [inaudible]

00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:07.930
but I see him planting barely
while yours is like rain.

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:11.750
In your company, poetry from others
means no more than dry ablution

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:15.100
by the banks of the tigress.

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:16.980
So what is the main point here?

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:20.460
The main point is that this return
wasn't an example of a group

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:24.120
of poets seeking to combat
a particularly problematic

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:28.110
and stagnant style of poetry,
increasingly to be associated

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:30.000
with places outside of Iran.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.530
But instead it was a group
of poets responding to social

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:36.670
and political dislocation on a
local level in Isfahan and trying

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:40.380
to rectify the rule of
poet, in poetry in general.

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:43.880
To do so, they offered one
another patronage and did

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:46.940
so by reaching back into their
literary cultural memories

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:49.450
and drawn the model
most apt for the task.

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:53.720
The great Khurasani poets of
old adept of praised palms.

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:57.160
And again I think to just return
to this point it's so important,

00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:59.290
because we don't have
any of the geoethnic

00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:05.550 position:56%
or georacial competition horsing
through this poetry like we do later

00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:09.060
on with [inaudible] and
certainly with Bahar.

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:10.930
There's something else going on.

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:13.950
It's a more kind of inward looking
movement that's really interested

00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:17.920
in reconstituting poetic networks
and the role of the poet in Iran

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:22.790
at the time following this great
dislocation after destruction

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:26.330
of Isfahan at the hands
of the invaders.

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:30.600
Now while the Isfahani poets
were reestablishing themselves,

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:33.270
where they were going back to
the styles of the Masters trying

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:36.380 position:56%
to reestablish the role of the poet.

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:38.550
Other things were happening in
the Persianate world as well,

00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:40.040
things that were not told

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:44.250
about through the tantalizing
Iranian centric framework

00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:45.550
of Bahar and others.

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:49.690
And now I'm going to turn to
that and look at both a case

00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:53.940
in South Asia and a case in
Afghanistan just very briefly.

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:56.550
And this isn't the whole story,
but it just goes to show you

00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:57.850
that there are other
voices out there,

00:30:57.850 --> 00:31:00.980
there are other things happening
outside of Iran in regards

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:02.450
to Persian poetic culture.

00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:05.470
It's to this decadent
stagnant literary environment,

00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:07.340
but in fact quite the contrary

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:10.280
and I think they actually
have some correlations

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:12.920
with what's happening in Iran.

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:16.830
So first I'm going to look at the
Carnatic state which is a state

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:20.700
that emerged following the breakup

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:24.800
of the [inaudible] empire
in the 18th Century.

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:27.680
And I'm not going to get into
all the reasons why it emerged,

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:28.980
emerged in the same way.

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:30.830
A lot of successor's
states did whole interplay

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:35.830
between various elites, the local
and imperial level competing

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:37.820
over resources and revenues.

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:42.700
But more important it's to
understand the general situation

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:44.000
of Persian poetic culture

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.750
and literary culture
in Iran at the time.

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:47.960
And to understand what
those locations were

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:50.120
in regards to Persia at the time.

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:52.770
Because Persian at the time
was really under strain

00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:56.140
and that's just the context
I think like it did with Iran

00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:59.330
for what's going to happen
in south Asia what I'm going

00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:01.060
to discuss in a minute.

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:05.040
So first of all what are the
strains on Persian during this time

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:06.570
in the 18th and 19th Century?

00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:08.730
Well first the break
of the mobile empire.

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:11.670
So all these individuals
were situated in Delhi

00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:15.380
who averse administrative
technologies and accounting

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:19.430
in scholarship and poetry that
was all based on Persia now need

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:21.120
to find employment elsewhere.

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:23.580
And that they were able to
do at some successor states.

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:26.800
They could go to [inaudible],
they could go to Hyderbad

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:29.490
and we'll see they could
go to Arcot as well.

00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:31.040
But they were forced
to kind of leave

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:32.530
and seek out other opportunities.

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:37.160
This kind of put a strain on
their employment opportunities.

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:39.790
Secondly and most importantly
perhaps,

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:42.590
the British intervention
educational activities puts

00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:44.610
on strain on Persian.

00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:48.190
So for example, Persian
instructors were, they continued

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:52.190
to be hired both in Calcutta and
in colleges across United Kingdom.

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:54.450
One could look at the great
colonial entity at the college

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:57.410
of fort William in Calcutta.

00:32:57.410 --> 00:33:00.900
And that was a place where
Persian was still being taught

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:05.700
but by the 1800s something was
changing, vernacular languages,

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:10.090
Hindustani and Urdu were beginning
to replace Persian at this level.

00:33:10.090 --> 00:33:14.010
And it was really a serious
intervention by the British.

00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:15.310
Persia still remained relevant.

00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:18.050
It was still taught, just like
it was still relevant for some

00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:20.160
of these successor states court.

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:24.010
But Urdu was more than keeping
pace in terms of class offerings,

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:28.260
translations and enrollment.

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:31.130
And just as a quick parenthetical
clause, this is not to say

00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:34.430
that Persian evaporated at
all or in one fell swoop.

00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:38.320 position:56%
I mean it continues well into the
20th Century in India to say nothing

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:40.920
of the traces it leaves
in Urdu of poetic culture

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.670
but something was really changing
and something was underway.

00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:46.590
And the British had a large part to
do with kind of this displacement

00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:52.050 position:56%
of strain on Persian and their
attitudes towards Persian is perhaps

00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:58.800
both best encapsulated and Thomas
Macauley's famous minute in 1835

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.890
where he says quote, a single shelf

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:04.780
of a good European library was
worth the whole native literature

00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:06.670
in India and Arabia, yeah.

00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:09.700
And I think by that he means
basically Persian and Arabic.

00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:13.920
So it was time for English and
vernacular languages like Urdu

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:17.360 position:56%
to replace the supremacy of Persian.

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:20.380 position:56%
And finally, really on aside a level
you have the rise of [inaudible]

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:23.360
which was slowly coming
to call itself Urdu.

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:26.970
One sees the increased
acceptability of Urdu to serve

00:34:26.970 --> 00:34:30.390
as a viable literary and
cultural medium of expression.

00:34:30.390 --> 00:34:33.060
Both in informal poetic gatherings

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:36.520
and also some of the
successor states.

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:40.490 position:56%
Patrons were beginning to fund poets

00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:42.860
who were composing
in Rekhta or in Urdu.

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:46.510
So again, this doesn't mean
Persian necessarily disappeared

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:51.210
but it was a long [inaudible]
of decline at this time.

00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:55.720
So which to me makes this notion
that there was this small court

00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:58.990
in South India even more
exciting and even more kind

00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:01.040
of counterintuitive and
that's the example I want

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:02.560
to turn to you right now.

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:05.230
And this is a Carnatic state,
this is a successor state

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:08.910 position:56%
that lasted from about 1698 to 1855.

00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:11.610
There you can send the map
and the South of India.

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:15.050 position:56%
So we're not talking about the great
Islamics of learning in North India

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:19.420
like [inaudible] Delhi or Agra but
in fact, in the south of India.

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:21.010
And it was a really
predominant place

00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:24.170
for Persian poetic
activity and productivity.

00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:26.620
And we can look at the
reasons why that was

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:28.560
and I've listed a couple here.

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:31.390
Well first it was a
matter of politics.

00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:33.730
So after 1801, this small state was

00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:36.480
under the [inaudible]
of the British.

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:39.740
That meant the British controlled
political and military affairs

00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:42.560
that allowed people like
the [inaudible] of Arcot

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:44.420
or the Carnatic state to focus

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:47.490
on more nonpolitical
matters and that they did.

00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:49.870
They created printing presses.

00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:53.020
They created libraries for the
collections of Islamic literatures

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:56.740
and Persian, Arabic and Urdu.

00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:59.140
Another reason why Persian I
think was able to thrive is

00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:03.270
because the court was located
right next to [inaudible]

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:07.900
which is now present day
[inaudible] three seats

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:13.380
of the East Indian presidency
in India at the time,

00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:17.400 position:56%
part of that colonial enterprise and
they were still utilizing Persian.

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.290
They utilizing for
administrative purposes.

00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:21.600
They were utilizing it
in order to interface

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:23.730
with local courts and elites.

00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:27.080 position:56%
And so people could come down to
Arcot or Mardras and they could work

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:31.780
for the British or they could come
and produce poetry for the Nawab.

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:36.300
And finally, the reason Persian
poetry and poetic culture thrived

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:38.500
in this sort of small
sort of outpost

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:40.360
in South India was the personality

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:44.930
of this individual Muhammad
Ghaws Kahn, pen name A'zam

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:47.910
who was really invested
in Persian poetry.

00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:50.330
He produced Persian poetry
in Urdu at an early age

00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:55.600 position:56%
and he established his great poetic
society, an exclusive poetic society

00:36:55.600 --> 00:37:02.660 position:56%
where people in Persian could recite
their verse and correct it as well.

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:06.080
So again, I just want to kind of
harp on this point that contrary

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:08.930
to what this kind of
grandiose narrative is saying,

00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:12.660
that nothing is happening in
Persian culture outside of Iran.

00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:16.970
And contrary to the fact that
most of the great Islamic centers

00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:18.960
of learning are in North India.

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:21.450
You have the court of the
last [inaudible] of Arcot

00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:25.710
who becomes invested in
promoting Persian poetry

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:27.080
and Persian literary culture.

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:31.190
And not only that but you find out
through a close reading of sources

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:34.910
that they're actually dealing
with the same kind of issues

00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:37.870
that the poets in Isfahan
are dealing with as well.

00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:39.880
And I'm not going to get into
all of the twists and turns

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:43.960
of these debates but what you find
out is that there's a huge kind

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.810
of outpouring of Tazkirah
production.

00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:48.600
You see that chart
I guess on your left

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:50.780
and that's really what attracted
me to this topic to begin

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:55.730 position:56%
with that they were the most kind of
prolific Tazkirahs produced in all

00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:57.750
of the Persianate world
at this time.

00:37:57.750 --> 00:38:00.630
And not only do you have
examples of poetic verse

00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:03.200
and their biographical
information, but you start finding

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:05.040
out about their lives and
what they were debating

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.910
and what was vexing them.

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:09.450
And you combine that
or you find out through

00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:11.010
that there were rival of networks.

00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:13.600
There were actually some poets
who were promoting a simple style

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:18.070
of poetry and some poets promoting
a complicated style of poetry

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:21.120
and you find out that in
fact during this time,

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:24.100
during this dislocating time
for Persian literary culture,

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:27.140
they were actually interested
in some of the same issues

00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:29.470
that vexing the poets in Isfahan.

00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:32.740
Issues such as who had the right
to speak for Persian poetry.

00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:36.010
Was it Indians or was it
Urduranians who had a more kind

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:38.630
of native fluency in the language?

00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:43.210
What's complicated or a
simple style of poetry.

00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:45.890
And so in some ways
raising these issues kind

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:48.880
of juxtaposing a complicated
and simple style of poetry

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:52.200
or even juxtaposing Indians on
the one hand and Urduranians

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:55.790
on the other it kind of anticipate
some of the geoethnic fault lines

00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:59.640 position:56%
that Bahar is going to talk about
you know, 100 years into the future.

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:02.180
But what's interesting about
this is these are Indians having

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:03.480
these debates.

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:07.220
So even if we work within the
categories that Bahar's laid out,

00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:12.460
even if we inscribed just some of
the characteristics of the simple

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:16.010
versus complicated poetry,
we can find Indian voices

00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:17.840
that were invested in
these debates that are kind

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:19.980
of attaching themselves
to this framework.

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:23.150
And I think by starting to
look at some of these elements,

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:24.650
these other kind of multiple sights

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:27.690
of Persian literary
production we could really begin

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:29.160
to write a more inclusive

00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:32.620
and integrative Persian
literary history.

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:35.210
So the last example I'll
give you and I wanted

00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:36.700
to make just brief
mention of Afghanistan.

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:38.480
Because Afghanistan in
particular and Central Asia

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:40.590
in general I think
often kind of falls

00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:42.030
through the cracks and the gaps.

00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:45.540
And time kind of prevents me
of getting a full appraisal

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:48.840
of how I think 19th Century
Afghanistan or trends

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:52.320
and Persian literary culture
there are connected to this story

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.720
but I do want to mention it.

00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:58.050
And first let's talk about
dislocations, I mean if that's one

00:39:58.050 --> 00:40:00.570
of the connective threads of this
talk, that there were dislocations

00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:04.170
in Isfahan or dislocations
in India and South India.

00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:07.390
There were also dislocations
in Afghanistan

00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:09.800
and the main dislocation
there was a political one.

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:13.480
It was the first Ango
Afghan from 1839 to 1842.

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:16.170
When the British came in
they invaded Afghanistan.

00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:18.960
They removed the ruler
or the [inaudible]

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:22.350
and they established a protector.

00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:25.620
As we well know from depictions
of this event in history

00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:30.150
and other books, the British had
to withdraw quite ignominiously

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:32.480
and they were pushed out
by an Afghan resistance

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:34.370
which is a great sense of pride

00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:38.460
for the national narrative
in Afghanistan.

00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:44.330 position:56%
What I think is less known, that for
Afghans, this event was commemorated

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:46.570
and memorialized in jangnamahs.

00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:50.460
That is battle poems that to pick
the events, occupation and retreat

00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:53.640
of the British in the
style of Ferdowsi,

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:58.300
in the style of perhaps the
most iconic and famous work

00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:01.710
of Persian poetry, the
Shahanamah, the work of one

00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:05.360
of this grandiose Masters that
we're told was only the domain

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:08.970
of Iranian poets in the
19th Century to return to.

00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:10.270
And what's so fascinating is

00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:11.910
that you have multiple
texts being produced

00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:16.140
around this time all focusing
on this one singular event.

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:19.720
Now of course people throughout
Islamic history imitating Ferdowsi

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:21.590
and Shahanameh, but I don't think

00:41:21.590 --> 00:41:23.820
on this scale Iran won
one particular event.

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:27.430
And certainly, not
in the 19th Century.

00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:29.160
And you could see,
these are the covers

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:35.200
from these various battle poems
recounting the first Anglo Afghan

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:36.500
war and there were
other -ones as well.

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:40.380
And these were both in the Library
of Congress collection here.

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:42.230
You have [inaudible]
by Muhammed [inaudible]

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:48.810
and you also have the cover of
the [inaudible] written by Akbar

00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:51.640
and Kashmiri and they were both put

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:59.880
out by the Afghan historical
society in the 1950s.

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:03.110
As an element or indication
of the way

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:06.820
in which these texts have been
promoted by the Afghan nation just

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:08.960
as an aside, if you
look at the poetry

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:11.990
of the Taliban today you'll also
find that there are references

00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:15.330
to Akbar as well as being this
great kind of nationalist hero.

00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:19.170
My point here is not to talk about
nationalism is in fact to talk

00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:21.590
about what kind of
prevalent these texts were.

00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:25.260
And not just these two texts but
other texts, an imitation of one

00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:29.220
of the great masters, Ferdowsi
were circulating around this time,

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:33.860
in not only Afghanistan but
also in South India as well.

00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:36.600
And I think it's really, really
important to recognize that.

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:37.900
At the production of these texts

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:42.340
and their circulation extends some
[inaudible] Kabul to South India.

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:45.700
They were based in oral tales
and different passerby travelers

00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:47.190
who witnessed key events.

00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:50.560
They circulated in manuscript
form, they were printed in places

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:53.220
like [inaudible] Agra and
benefited from the patronage

00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:55.850
of both local rulers and
the British themselves.

00:42:55.850 --> 00:42:58.350
In other words, these texts
again drawn on the style

00:42:58.350 --> 00:43:00.600
of the masters created
a type of market

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:02.990
that privilege and
valued this style.

00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:04.740
Which in of itself
would be interesting

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:08.310
if we just had these texts that
were kind of percolating around.

00:43:08.310 --> 00:43:11.220
But even more so at the
story Persian literature,

00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:14.550
literary history tells us precisely
that this shouldn't be happening.

00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:18.930
That we should only be having an
engagement with the Masters in Iran

00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:23.350
and this is again, I think
an element like the court

00:43:23.350 --> 00:43:24.650
of [inaudible] that
has kind of been edited

00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:26.300
out of Persian literary history.

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:27.880
And I think it's kind of you know,

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:32.000
due time to incorporate
these and other voices.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.500
So I'll just say in
conclusion in the 18th Century

00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:38.380
and 19th Century was a time of
kind of serious, kind of social

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:42.680
and political, linguistic
dislocation for Persian and a lot

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:44.680
of different places and
I'll be pointing to those.

00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:48.390
And a lot of the longstanding norms
that created kind of connectivity

00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:52.000
between various elites and
poets are being strained.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.100
But if we kind of maintain
adherence to this framework

00:43:56.100 --> 00:44:00.550
that is nationalists in scope
and erases a multiplicity

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:03.240
of literary phenomena
occurring outside of Iran,

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:04.540
I think that's really going

00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:06.740
to militate again writing
a more integrative

00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:08.350
and inclusive literary history.

00:44:08.350 --> 00:44:09.970
So the hope is that, I
mean these are a couple

00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:13.690
of examples we can begin to
integrate into our understanding

00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:15.720
of Persian literary history
and kind of move it away

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:19.800
from an Iranian story and make
it more of a global story.

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.600
So, thank you very
much for your time.

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:26.510
[ Applause ]

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:32.050
[ Silence ]

00:44:32.050 --> 00:44:33.350
&gt;&gt; Folks thank you for coming.

00:44:33.350 --> 00:44:35.570
We have time for about
a few questions.

00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:36.870
Feel free to ask.

00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:38.670
Dr. [inaudible] go ahead.

00:44:38.670 --> 00:45:56.540
[ Inaudible ]

00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:59.950 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean this is a really
interesting question and I just kind

00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:02.180
of went over it quite quickly.

00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:05.830
Of course the origins of Urdu
whether it could be established

00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:07.130
in the Delhi literary salons

00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:09.230
or in the [inaudible]
is very controversial.

00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:13.580
I mean particularly for a kind
of Urdu literatures and speakers.

00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:16.050
Yeah, I mean something
is definitely happening.

00:46:16.050 --> 00:46:18.560
I mean there's a groundswell of
people who has become interested

00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:22.200
in this language both as a
societal level and sort of a kind

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:25.180
of court level in the 19th Century.

00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:29.280 position:56%
And again as I mentioned the British
really have a part to play in this.

00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:33.790 position:56%
You know, I think there is some kind
of healthy competition between them.

00:46:33.790 --> 00:46:36.210
You can even see when if you look
at the production of Tazkirahs

00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:40.540
over time these great kind of
codifiers of poetic culture.

00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:44.840
I mean the first Tazkirahs of
Urdu poets are written in Persian.

00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:49.020
And really it's not until the 1840s
that you begin to see Tazkirahs

00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:52.620
in Urdu about Urdu poets.

00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:57.800
So you know, I don't know what that
means as far as the unit workings

00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:00.980
of their competition, again I
think Urdu becomes a more kind

00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:05.650
of acceptable literary medium,
cultural medium for the you know,

00:47:05.650 --> 00:47:08.250
North Indian Muslim
gentry and elites.

00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:10.110
But I think people are
still trying to figure

00:47:10.110 --> 00:47:12.020
out exactly what the
relationship is.

00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:15.430
Someone like [inaudible] says, well
into the 20th Century you can walk

00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:17.710
into an Urdu literary salon
and you can speak Persian

00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:19.010
and no one would bat an eye.

00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:22.140
They were quite acceptable of that.

00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:26.680
But again I think people are
kind of working on this issue

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:29.430
and really going back to
Tazkirahs and some of the debates

00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:31.770
between [inaudible] and the
[inaudible] and you're right I mean

00:47:31.770 --> 00:47:34.450
that story is one that is
repeated over and over again.

00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:38.970
But it's kind of unclear to what
extent perhaps that was true

00:47:38.970 --> 00:47:40.740
and how it defined
debates at that time.

00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:45.510
I haven't looked into the
question, Urdu question you know,

00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:47.710
my understanding was you
know, that kind of happened

00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:49.380
until the early 20th century.

00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:52.370
I'm not sure when the first
written Pashtu text emerged.

00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:55.190
I think some time in the
mid to late 19th Century.

00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:59.580
So I don't know, but I'd be
surprised if it has the same level

00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:02.520
of competition that
Urdu and Persian do just

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:05.540
because poetic culture is
built up on so many sites,

00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:09.440
with so many people in
a place like South Asia.

00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:11.240
Yeah.

00:48:11.240 --> 00:50:03.100
[ Inaudible ]

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:04.870
&gt;&gt; No, no, that's absolutely right.

00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:06.170
No, no, no, I mean thanks

00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:07.470
for clarifying I should've
mentioned that yes.

00:50:07.470 --> 00:50:11.470
I mean one of the interests of
this topic is that for better

00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:13.730
or worse this is actually the
time when the Persian world begins

00:50:13.730 --> 00:50:16.610
to fray and break apart and so
it's kind of interesting to figure

00:50:16.610 --> 00:50:19.040
out how that happens,
how people understand it.

00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:23.360 position:56%
And so what I pointed to with all
these cases, in particular with Iran

00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:28.670 position:56%
and south India case is that it was
about trying to get a sense of self,

00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:33.060
amidst this change of
culture with the stakes

00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:34.580
to the game were changing.

00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:37.210
I mean you're right there's
stories to be told and people

00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:41.680
like telling these stories
[inaudible] and elsewhere.

00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:44.260
It's really a fascinating
period for that reason.

00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:49.510
And you're right I probably
shouldn't be too hard on Bahar.

00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:50.970
I shouldn't say that necessarily

00:50:50.970 --> 00:50:52.440
that he consciously
edited things out.

00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:55.070 position:56%
I mean he had a project to undertake

00:50:55.070 --> 00:50:57.270
and he didn't probably
have the materials,

00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:59.090
certainly he didn't have
the materials that we did

00:50:59.090 --> 00:51:00.850
in all the catalogs
that we went through.

00:51:00.850 --> 00:51:04.360
And he's certainly a foil
for me and for other people.

00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:09.740
But no, I mean he really sets
the parameters of this debate.

00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:13.740
He does and I'm still working
within you know, his categories.

00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:16.760
I still go back and look
to the Bazgasht poets

00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:19.430
and perhaps I shouldn't even go
back and look for Bazgasht poets.

00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:22.860
I shouldn't be you
know, limiting my scope.

00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:27.230
But yeah you know he did some
great things but you know,

00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:31.310
he just had a couple of errors,
a couple of errors that tended

00:51:31.310 --> 00:51:33.280
to what I think Iranian nationalism

00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:36.430
and we'll just slightly
correct them and move on.

00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:38.230
Yeah thanks.

00:51:38.230 --> 00:52:02.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:06.060
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean this issue of
accessibility text circulation,

00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:09.000
of text [inaudible] is the kind of
project I'm working on right now.

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.560
And I think if you look at
these commemorative texts,

00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:16.410
that charred poetic activity,
see which ones circulated more

00:52:16.410 --> 00:52:18.950
than others, see which ones
were privileged over time,

00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:24.610
I think we'll have a better
insight into kind of this question

00:52:24.610 --> 00:52:28.940
to people actually saw themselves
and what their kind of preview was

00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:32.760
of the world and that's the kind of
thing I'm very much interested in.

00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:38.270
You know, what was the preview
geographic or temporal of you know,

00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:42.760
19th Century South Asia versus
kind of 19th Century Iran.

00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:44.720
And so it's kind of
a large undertaking.

00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:49.270
And I should say this Tazkirahs
genre is absolutely prolific.

00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:50.760
It's totally unyielding.

00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:52.270
I mean I'm trying to
map them right now.

00:52:52.270 --> 00:52:56.270
There could be 400, 500 that could
recount the lives of you know,

00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:58.420
sometimes up to 1000 poets.

00:52:58.420 --> 00:53:01.610
So it's a long work ahead and
people are kind of you know,

00:53:01.610 --> 00:53:03.460
making end roads in different ways.

00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:06.170
But yeah, to your point in the
relationship between the poets

00:53:06.170 --> 00:53:11.190
and the texts, that is a big
one and look for example,

00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:13.590
these poets in South India,
they knew who Azar was.

00:53:13.590 --> 00:53:15.920
I mean they knew who the
poets in Isfahan were.

00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:21.260 position:56%
They didn't have a sense of them
being the revivers of Persian poetry

00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:22.780
at the time, but they
knew who they were based

00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:24.280
on the circulation of the text.

00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:29.400
I mean Azar's [inaudible] which is
kind of held off as this first text

00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:31.510
that [inaudible] Persian
poetry and promotes this kind

00:53:31.510 --> 00:53:35.180
of protonational story I mean was
lithographed in Bombay at the time.

00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:37.320
And I only know that because
I've looked at you know,

00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:40.420
these two places in conversation.

00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:41.790
But there's a whole
world out there to kind

00:53:41.790 --> 00:53:43.270
of start drawing connections to.

00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:46.970
&gt;&gt; I have a little follow
up question very quickly.

00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:49.170
This will be the last
question if that's okay.

00:53:49.170 --> 00:53:50.560
You can ask questions afterwards.

00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:55.400
Just in terms of Central Asia
and Turkistan I'm just curious

00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:57.410
if you were to take these tribes,

00:53:57.410 --> 00:54:01.540
especially when Turkistan then was
being divided and given these sort

00:54:01.540 --> 00:54:03.860
of identities to come later on.

00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:06.450
How does that play
itself out in that area?

00:54:06.450 --> 00:54:08.990
A and B, if you could
give a little overview

00:54:08.990 --> 00:54:11.350
of the Tazkirah project
you're working on now,

00:54:11.350 --> 00:54:13.900
so the people know what
to look forward to.

00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:17.820
&gt;&gt; Okay so, no great so the first
question yeah I mean Central Asia

00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:20.580
actually has a story
to tell as well.

00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:25.640
And later in the 19th Century
you have a group of [inaudible]

00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:30.070
that were advocating for
[inaudible] reform that were moving

00:54:30.070 --> 00:54:32.700
against what they saw
as the decadent kind

00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:36.340
of static Islamic culture
of the time.

00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:41.590
And they were very much invested
in creating a simpler prose

00:54:41.590 --> 00:54:48.460
and a simple style of verse which
I think has its kind of resonances

00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:53.990
in places like well Iran but also
Afghanistan later in the century.

00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:56.550
So yeah, they were Jadids,
people that [inaudible],

00:54:56.550 --> 00:55:01.140
people like [inaudible] who very
much recognized that or thought

00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:06.620
that the complicated Persian prose
and verse was ill equipped to deal

00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:10.130
with the modern kind of
issues they want to deal with.

00:55:10.130 --> 00:55:12.330
So yeah, that is happening
as well and again,

00:55:12.330 --> 00:55:16.100
I mean I think there is
something happening with Persia

00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:19.470
and the way people are kind
of transforming both in poetic

00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:23.030
and in prose form to make it more
durable for the modern world.

00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:26.640
And you see that with the
poetry of Muhammed Taqi Bahar,

00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:28.890
Bahar you see it with
tarz-i in Afghanistan,

00:55:28.890 --> 00:55:31.800
you see it with the
Jadids in Central Asia.

00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:35.650
Yeah, the Tazkirah project, I
kind of mentioned it briefly.

00:55:35.650 --> 00:55:37.920
What I'm trying to do is just kind

00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:41.890
of take a macroscopic look
at Tazkirahs production.

00:55:41.890 --> 00:55:43.980
So just kind of actually plot

00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:49.160 position:56%
on a map were certain Tazkirahs were
being produced during what time.

00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:51.600
And I think if we see that
we can start to see the kind

00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:54.040
of connectivity of
the Persianate world.

00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:55.940 position:56%
And not only that, to see which kind

00:55:55.940 --> 00:55:58.060
of Tazkirahs circulated
most prominently.

00:55:58.060 --> 00:56:00.920
So a lot of kind of
intertextual connections,

00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:04.200
bibliographic citations
within these texts.

00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:06.260
They were always adamant
to kind of prefer

00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:08.840
to previous Tazkirahs
authors whether

00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:11.340
that means they really saw the
Tazkirahs or they were just kind

00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:15.430 position:56%
of padding their bibliographies like
I do or many of us do I don't know.

00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:19.540
But it is indicative I think
of some kind of you know,

00:56:19.540 --> 00:56:23.630
integrated transregional
Cosmopolis of the times.

00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:24.960 position:56%
So yeah, that's kind of the project.

00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:29.750
It's still working itself out and
the last element is to see kind

00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:32.490
of which poets to be remembered
at a particular moment in time.

00:56:32.490 --> 00:56:34.550
And when that changes over
time and what that says

00:56:34.550 --> 00:56:39.230
about how people saw the
Persianate world at the time.

00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:40.530
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:56:40.530 --> 00:56:45.080
&gt;&gt; Thank you everyone for coming.

00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:48.730
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
