00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.910
A famous thinker, some may even call

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:05.390
infamous, Francis Galton coined the term nature versus

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.850
nurture and it seems pretty relevant for

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.270
this point of our discussion on complex traits.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:11.670
&gt;&gt; So you mean that there's a

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.120
genetic or inborn component and, and environment component.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.450
&gt;&gt; Exactly, and it seems that breast cancer

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.060
is affected by both environment and genetics. So

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.270
you tell us, which part is the nature

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.930
and which part is the nurture? Match overall

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.630
genetics and overall mutation load to the proper category.
