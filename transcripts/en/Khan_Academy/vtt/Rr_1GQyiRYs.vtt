00:00:00.164 --> 00:00:01.504
- [Voiceover] We already
know the derivatives

00:00:01.504 --> 00:00:02.723
of sine and cosine.

00:00:02.723 --> 00:00:05.295
We know that the derivative
with respect to x

00:00:05.295 --> 00:00:08.628
of sine of x is equal to cosine of x.

00:00:10.808 --> 00:00:14.392
We know that the derivative
with respect to x

00:00:14.392 --> 00:00:18.475
of cosine of x is equal
to negative sine of x.

00:00:20.237 --> 00:00:21.997
And so what we want to do in this video

00:00:21.997 --> 00:00:26.078
is find the derivatives of the
other basic trig functions.

00:00:26.078 --> 00:00:28.646
So, in particular, we
know, let's figure out

00:00:28.646 --> 00:00:31.322
what the derivative with respect to x,

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:33.677
let's first do tangent of x.

00:00:33.677 --> 00:00:36.817
Tangent of x, well this is the same thing

00:00:36.817 --> 00:00:40.984
as trying to find the
derivative with respect to x of,

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.247
well, tangent of x is just sine of x,

00:00:46.247 --> 00:00:48.747
sine of x over cosine of x.

00:00:49.987 --> 00:00:52.404
And since it can be expressed

00:00:53.578 --> 00:00:56.538
as the quotient of two functions,

00:00:56.538 --> 00:01:00.534
we can apply the quotient
rule here to evaluate this,

00:01:00.534 --> 00:01:03.013
or to figure out what this is going to be.

00:01:03.013 --> 00:01:06.818
The quotient rule tells us
that this is going to be

00:01:06.818 --> 00:01:09.227
the derivative of the top function,

00:01:09.227 --> 00:01:13.651
which we know is cosine of
x times the bottom function

00:01:13.651 --> 00:01:17.151
which is cosine of x, so times cosine of x

00:01:18.685 --> 00:01:22.852
minus, minus the top
function, which is sine of x,

00:01:24.252 --> 00:01:28.419
sine of x, times the derivative
of the bottom function.

00:01:29.572 --> 00:01:33.547
So the derivative of cosine
of x is negative sine of x,

00:01:33.547 --> 00:01:35.317
so I can put the sine of x there,

00:01:35.317 --> 00:01:38.008
but where the negative
can just cancel that out.

00:01:38.008 --> 00:01:40.591
And it's going to be over, over

00:01:42.054 --> 00:01:44.028
the bottom function squared.

00:01:44.028 --> 00:01:45.945
So cosine squared of x.

00:01:47.345 --> 00:01:48.801
Now, what is this?

00:01:48.801 --> 00:01:52.968
Well, what we have here, this
is just a cosine squared of x,

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.882
this is just sine squared of x.

00:01:58.356 --> 00:02:00.484
And we know from the Pythagorean identity,

00:02:00.484 --> 00:02:01.513
and this is really just out of,

00:02:01.513 --> 00:02:03.495
comes out of the unit circle definition,

00:02:03.495 --> 00:02:06.429
the cosine squared of x
plus sine squared of x,

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:09.007
well that's gonna be
equal to one for any x.

00:02:09.007 --> 00:02:11.223
So all of this is equal to one.

00:02:11.223 --> 00:02:15.223
And so we end up with one
over cosine squared x,

00:02:16.775 --> 00:02:21.076
which is the same thing as,
which is the same thing as,

00:02:21.076 --> 00:02:23.326
the secant of x squared.

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:26.760
One over cosine of x is secant,

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.636
so this is just secant of x squared.

00:02:29.636 --> 00:02:30.889
So that was pretty straightforward.

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:33.403
Now, let's just do the inverse of the,

00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:35.089
or you could say the
reciprocal, I should say,

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:38.270
of the tangent function,
which is the cotangent.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.331
Oh, that was fun, so let's do that,

00:02:40.331 --> 00:02:41.831
d dx of cotangent,

00:02:43.685 --> 00:02:46.185
not cosine, of cotangent of x.

00:02:48.053 --> 00:02:52.220
Well, same idea, that's the
derivative with respect to x,

00:02:53.626 --> 00:02:58.166
and this time, let me make some
sufficiently large brackets.

00:02:58.166 --> 00:03:01.916
So now this is cosine of x over sine of x,

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.090
over sine of x.

00:03:05.558 --> 00:03:08.523
But once again, we can use
the quotient rule here,

00:03:08.523 --> 00:03:12.157
so this is going to be the
derivative of the top function

00:03:12.157 --> 00:03:15.845
which is negative, use that magenta color.

00:03:15.845 --> 00:03:18.012
That is negative sine of x

00:03:20.921 --> 00:03:23.351
times the bottom function,

00:03:23.351 --> 00:03:25.851
so times sine of x, sine of x,

00:03:27.242 --> 00:03:28.242
minus, minus

00:03:32.172 --> 00:03:34.672
the top function, cosine of x,

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.409
cosine of x, times the
derivative of the bottom function

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:43.680
which is just going to
be another cosine of x,

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.785
and then all of that over
the bottom function squared.

00:03:47.785 --> 00:03:49.785
So sine of x squared.

00:03:51.145 --> 00:03:52.631
Now what does this simplify to?

00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:56.464
Up here, let's see, this
is sine squared of x,

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.337
we have a negative there,

00:04:00.337 --> 00:04:02.504
minus cosine squared of x.

00:04:03.836 --> 00:04:05.321
But we could factor out the negative

00:04:05.321 --> 00:04:08.988
and this would be
negative sine squared of x

00:04:09.877 --> 00:04:11.960
plus cosine squared of x.

00:04:13.131 --> 00:04:16.593
Well, this is just one by
the Pythagorean identity,

00:04:16.593 --> 00:04:19.662
and so this is negative
one over sine squared x,

00:04:19.662 --> 00:04:22.412
negative one over sine squared x.

00:04:23.853 --> 00:04:26.270
And that is the same thing as

00:04:27.278 --> 00:04:29.445
negative cosecant squared,

00:04:30.955 --> 00:04:33.538
I'm running out of space, of x.

00:04:35.426 --> 00:04:36.509
There you go.
