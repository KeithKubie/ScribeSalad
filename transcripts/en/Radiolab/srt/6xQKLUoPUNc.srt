1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:05,700
You are listening to
radio lab radio from W.

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,900
N y. S. T. E. N. P. E. R.

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:15,570
All right. K. Yup. I want to start
with a parental daydream for a second.

4
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,650
It's an idea that's been kicking around
for me since my kids were born. Okay.

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,810
Actually the idea itself is pretty old.

6
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:25,560
It goes back to the 18 hundreds right
around Napoleon's time to a fellow by the

7
00:00:25,561 --> 00:00:28,340
name of John Baptist. Pierre
Antwan. Monet evaluates the

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,820
Lamar Lamarck Giambattista Lamar
who according to writers, same keen.

9
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,810
He was really one of the first
grand theorists in biology.

10
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,940
He actually coined the word biology
to really? Yup. His big idea,

11
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:42,811
as you might know,

12
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:47,250
is that what a person does in their
lifetime could be directly passed to their

13
00:00:47,251 --> 00:00:52,230
kids very easily. His famous
example was giraffes. Lamarck said,

14
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,320
do you want to know how a giraffe
got his long neck one day?

15
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:56,940
This giraffe mother draft,

16
00:00:56,941 --> 00:01:01,590
let's say he was looking up into tree
and saw some fruit and had to stretch her

17
00:01:01,591 --> 00:01:04,860
neck and stretch again,
whole lifetime of stretching.

18
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,050
And then when she had a baby stretching,

19
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,590
got into the baby and then that baby
would stretch and stretch and stretching

20
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:09,810
it.

21
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,200
Him Give a little more stretching to its
baby and eventually over the millennia

22
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:17,040
what you'd get is a creature with a very
long neck because they're reaching for

23
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:20,880
the tops of trees. It makes a kind
of common sense really. It does.

24
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:24,360
And it does make kind of a a folk sense.
He thought it worked with humans too.

25
00:01:24,361 --> 00:01:27,030
His example with humans was a blacksmith.

26
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,090
He thought that because they're
swinging hammers all day,

27
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,480
they got big bulking muscles and then
they would pass the muscles to their

28
00:01:33,481 --> 00:01:34,314
children.

29
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:41,430
The sneaky idea here is that
the blacksmiths, the giraffes,

30
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,910
they made it happen. They
willed the neck to get longer,

31
00:01:44,911 --> 00:01:46,160
the muscles to get bigger. And the,

32
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,740
the key point is that it wasn't
something in born in them.

33
00:01:49,741 --> 00:01:52,620
It was something they acquire
during their lifetime,

34
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,630
which they passed to their kids. Right.

35
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,920
And that's wrong. That's
not how far we're telling.

36
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:03,990
Now know that that's not the
case, but, but wouldn't be nice

37
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:08,590
if that's how it worked.
Let's read the book first and

38
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,960
cause you know, now that I've
got these two kids right now I

39
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,990
find myself thinking like, okay, I know
these kids have their genes half for me,

40
00:02:19,991 --> 00:02:24,760
half for my wife and I know I can't change
those genes and I know fate is going

41
00:02:24,761 --> 00:02:29,620
to give them a couple of random mutations
in those genes that I have no control

42
00:02:29,621 --> 00:02:33,130
over. That is just the cold logic
of Darwinian evolution. Yeah.

43
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:37,510
What's offensive? I mean the idea that
they could be constrained by their DNA,

44
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,380
maybe one of us gave them a bit of
DNA that's going to hold them back.

45
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:46,450
It's a terrible thought. This letter
right here. Oh, how about this one?

46
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,270
And so what you do, I
think all parents do this,

47
00:02:49,271 --> 00:02:54,040
is that you slip into this Lamarckian
delusion that what you do with your kids

48
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,130
could somehow rewrite all that that
you can somehow by just being nice,

49
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,070
them reading them stories or
whatever, that you could break

50
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:04,090
them free of all that. We rewrite
their, their their blueprint. Like,

51
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,120
I dunno, you don't really say it
to yourself that way, but yeah,

52
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:11,590
you can make a deep difference. Yeah.
Like you can help them overcome you.

53
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,880
Is that cool? Hello?
No, you can't. I know.

54
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:19,030
That's what Darwin says.
You can't. I know. I know.

55
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,201
Once they're born,

56
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:26,700
their genes are fixed and change does
not happen in a generation or two.

57
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,140
It happens in really,
really, really slowly.

58
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,000
Gradually achingly slowly one parent's
stretching isn't going to do anything.

59
00:03:36,001 --> 00:03:40,410
See, that's the bummer of
Darwinian evolution. As a
parent, you are a tiny blip

60
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,640
and a very, very long story.

61
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:50,720
[inaudible]

62
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,460
but this hour we're going to fight
this sort of sad sack feeling of

63
00:03:55,490 --> 00:04:00,290
inevitability and impotence and rewrite
the so-called rules of genetics.

64
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:03,040
That's right. Today on radio lab,
we are going to lick some rat,

65
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,240
starve some Swedes there.
Realized some women.

66
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,610
I mean we're not going
to do that ourselves. No,

67
00:04:07,611 --> 00:04:10,760
but we're going to play the stories
where these things actually happen. Yes.

68
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,430
I'm Chad. Boom. Rod. I'm Robert
Krulwich. This is radio lab stick around.

69
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,013
It's going to get messy.

70
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:26,230
[inaudible]

71
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:29,890
okay, so let's get going and stick with
your boy the mark just for a second.

72
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,590
[inaudible] okay.

73
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,800
Cause we were talking to science right
across Zimmer and he told us that back in

74
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:37,970
the early 19 hundreds this um,

75
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,490
tension between the mark and
Darwin got extra tense in a,

76
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:46,360
in a sort of fascinating way.
Right. And it all started in Vienna

77
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:50,320
at this really marvelous
place called the VI varium

78
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,160
vape. Varium yeah,

79
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,160
this was a really radical place at the
time because you have to remember that

80
00:04:57,161 --> 00:05:00,520
people studying animals up til
now, they were basically, you know,

81
00:05:00,521 --> 00:05:05,400
studying Lima preserved specimen and so
on at the vivarium as the name suggests,

82
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:10,140
they had lie, man. It was like a zoo.

83
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,150
Well it was a zoo where there was
all sorts of experiments going on.

84
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:17,320
You know, the fact is that
taking care of animals,

85
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,140
trying to keep them alive in a
building is not an easy thing,

86
00:05:20,141 --> 00:05:22,210
especially if it's 1903.

87
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:28,710
But luckily for the vivarium and for our
story, they had a guy, Paul [inaudible]

88
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,970
[inaudible] who was he?
Um, so he, and when was he?

89
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,260
He was born in 1880 in Vienna,
Jewish family by all accounts.

90
00:05:36,261 --> 00:05:38,900
A pretty good looking guy
in, in pictures. He has that,

91
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:43,640
you know that crazy Einstein fuzzy hair
thing. Virginia's cut. Yep. He's 22,

92
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:48,650
23 and you already have this reputation
for being amazing at keeping animals

93
00:05:48,651 --> 00:05:50,290
alive that otherwise would just

94
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,653
die.

95
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:56,340
His reputation was that he could get
inside the mind of say a salamander.

96
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,250
I know just

97
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,500
what I wanted to eat or how much
humidity it preferred. Right.

98
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,850
He was a born nurturer
and he adored animals.

99
00:06:04,851 --> 00:06:09,380
He actually named his daughter a less
Serta, which is a genus of Lizard.

100
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:11,960
That's the kind of guy he is.

101
00:06:11,961 --> 00:06:16,961
So of course the folks at the vivarium
asked him to build these terrariums and

102
00:06:17,091 --> 00:06:19,640
aquariums and stock them with animals,

103
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,800
including a particular in fib Ian, that
plays a very big part in the story.

104
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:28,540
The midwife towed the midwife
towed, right? That's right.

105
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:32,530
You're Sam Kean again and here's he says
what you need to know about the midwife

106
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:36,580
tote. Basically the midwife toad has
a strange habit for toads. Most toads,

107
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,350
he says love to stay in the water.

108
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:41,710
They like to hang out in the water and
the females like to lay eggs in the

109
00:06:41,711 --> 00:06:43,180
water. But with the midwife towed,

110
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,890
the female lays her eggs on land
and then the male midwife towed,

111
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,890
comes along,

112
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:53,950
grabs the eggs and actually kind
of sticks them to his back legs,

113
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,080
like a bunch of whitish grapes and then
hops around with them basically until

114
00:07:00,031 --> 00:07:03,900
they hatch. So he's got to live his life
as a towed with all this baggage on him

115
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,210
just until they hatch and then til
they go off still that's a burden.

116
00:07:07,211 --> 00:07:09,730
If he's carrying a big burden
there is, your wife can hear this,

117
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:15,880
she cares your kids for nine months
and you're like that pork nail towed.

118
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,010
Anyhow, so you've got this Guy Paul
camera who's good with animals.

119
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:24,080
He got these toads who hate water and in
one day we can imagine he gets curious

120
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:28,210
as he's doing his rounds, he stops
by the midwife towed [inaudible] me,

121
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,250
looks down at that little male towed
with a grape stuck to his legs and he

122
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:36,170
wonders how adaptable is that
little guy. I mean he hates water.

123
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,800
Females seem to hate laying eggs in the
water, but is that the end of the story?

124
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:45,520
What would happen if I
made them go in the water?

125
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,310
Could they adapt? I know what I'll do.

126
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,830
I'm going to set up a terrarium for
them and I'm going to make it hot.

127
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,000
Really uncomfortably hot,

128
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,000
but I'm going to give them
a base in a water. Nice,

129
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,480
cool water and he would
basically turn the heat way,

130
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:04,500
way up in music aquariums until
they had to go under water.

131
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,770
You can imagine these tilts are
like, dammit, fine. All right,

132
00:08:07,771 --> 00:08:10,110
I'll get in the water. Maybe
they'd try and jump back out,

133
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,180
but it was still hot so
they'd have to jump back in.

134
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,640
And since the camera kept the heat up,

135
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:18,240
toads basically had to stay
there in this watery place.

136
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,590
Did they had not evolved for Darwin's
theory would have said, you know,

137
00:08:22,591 --> 00:08:24,570
90% of the toads are gonna die.

138
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,040
There's going to be this massacre of
toads and only a few lucky ones are going

139
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:34,250
to survive. And those lucky ones,
according to Darwin's theory,

140
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,960
they would have had to have been born
with some random mutation in their gene

141
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:42,010
that gave them an
advantage in this situation

142
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,710
and that advantage, whatever it was,

143
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,320
because it starts with one individual
and then it gets passed onto the kids and

144
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:53,160
then onto their kids. It
would take a long, long,

145
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:58,670
long time to through the whole population
because generally that's how evolution

146
00:08:58,891 --> 00:09:02,250
works. It takes a while.
But according to camera,

147
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,400
here's what happened. When
he heated up the toads,

148
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:09,420
a little cage that hit spend more
time in the water as expected.

149
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,140
And when it came time to mate,
the males and the females,

150
00:09:13,141 --> 00:09:17,580
they would mate in the water at first
didn't go so well because you know,

151
00:09:17,581 --> 00:09:20,370
if you're Atlanto and you're trying to
have sex in the water, it's kind of hard.

152
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,710
Your slippery partner's slippery.

153
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,110
You just have it evolved for
this and there's no way you can,

154
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:28,180
at least not quickly.
But according to camera,

155
00:09:28,181 --> 00:09:33,000
shortly after these toads got into the
water, they did begin to evolve fast.

156
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,790
They began to grow these little
puffy things on their hands,

157
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,240
the these kind of rough scratchy pads,

158
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:43,200
what's known as a nuptual
pad, nuptial path. Right.

159
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:47,040
It was just what the males needed so
they can grab onto the female and hold

160
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,830
tight while they're mating. And
they didn't have these on land? No,

161
00:09:49,831 --> 00:09:53,990
they did not have them on land.
They disappeared in the water. Yup.

162
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:59,570
And how long did it take? Right
away, we, in just two generations,

163
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:03,380
these toads seem to have done something
that should've taken, I don't know,

164
00:10:03,381 --> 00:10:06,950
50 a hundred generations,
maybe more camera thought. Wow.

165
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:11,000
They can respond to the environment.
Do we revealing it with experiments?

166
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,890
They're not trapped by their genes.

167
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:18,270
Around 1908 he starts publishing all of
these results and it's big news and he

168
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,010
grabs toads and he hit the road. He hit
the lecture circuit and he hit it big.

169
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,780
He was known for going around and giving
what he called his big show lectures

170
00:10:28,781 --> 00:10:33,781
where he would wow whole audiences of
people and in 1923 he actually comes to

171
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:36,050
England.

172
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,490
There was a newspaper called the daily
express and they have these headlines

173
00:10:39,491 --> 00:10:42,700
that come out. It says race of Superman.

174
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,610
That's the headline for his
talk race. Then below that,

175
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:47,680
right below the headline says,
scientists, great discovery,

176
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:51,010
which may change us all. What's he talking
about? We're just talking about tote.

177
00:10:51,011 --> 00:10:52,870
I thought, it's not just
talking about toads anymore.

178
00:10:52,871 --> 00:10:57,460
He's gone way beyond toads. Ki
extended this idea to people.

179
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:01,960
He thought that you could kind of
engineer societies by changing the

180
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,460
environment. I just have
to read this to you,

181
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:07,150
the results and make it probable that
our descendants will learn more quickly.

182
00:11:07,151 --> 00:11:09,970
What we know well will
execute more easily.

183
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,010
What we have accomplished
with great effort,

184
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:17,610
we'll be able to withstand what injured
us almost to the point of death where we

185
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,810
sought. They will find where
we began. They will account

186
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:27,730
and this idea won him a lot of fans,
including not surprisingly the Soviet,

187
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:32,450
yeah. It was a very attractive theory to
them in Moscow because the Soviets may

188
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,720
believe in Karl Marx's idea that human
beings are an improvable species.

189
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,070
That if you can change the conditions
around people, you change the people.

190
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:43,090
Your camera was saying, you know,
you can do this even on a physical,

191
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:45,803
but

192
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,470
there are a lot of skeptics and there
were from the beginning when camera

193
00:11:50,471 --> 00:11:54,580
published his results initially, a bunch
of scientists immediately began to say,

194
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,360
wait a minute, hold on here. It
would be nice if life was like that.

195
00:11:58,361 --> 00:12:00,650
But life isn't like that. Life is hard.

196
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:05,870
People can't just will themselves into
a more perfect form according to Darwin,

197
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:10,730
life and changes are ruled by chance
and fate and to believe anything else

198
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:14,600
that's naive. So this whole toad
thing to the Darwinian faction,

199
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,010
it didn't scan really.

200
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:20,930
So some scientists began to ask Cameron
if they could look at his totes and just

201
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,310
take a little peak for themselves and
every time Canberra or our said no,

202
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,560
they were his specimen, get your own.

203
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,680
It was kind of this
struggle for a few years.

204
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,870
Then world war one came and that
kind of disrupted everything.

205
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:37,250
Camera for one was sent off to work as
a sensor for the Austrian military and

206
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,800
his lab ended up getting destroyed,

207
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:43,580
including all his toads except he had one,

208
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:48,370
he had one remaining midwife
towed. So this whole debate,

209
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,070
two totally different ways of seeing life.

210
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,960
It all came down to this jar with his
towed in it and you have to bear in mind

211
00:12:55,961 --> 00:13:00,961
that at this point it only had one hand
left and right and had been cut off for,

212
00:13:03,001 --> 00:13:05,260
for microscopic slides.

213
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:10,650
And so you could only see one nuptial
pad and it all comes down to this

214
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,690
and [inaudible]

215
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:19,100
all of it was just about to fall apart.
What happened? Well, there was a,

216
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:23,430
a uh, expert on reptiles
named at g Kingsley Noble,

217
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:28,350
Gladwin Kingsley Noble. What an aim.
The guy, it sounds like trouble.

218
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:32,940
Oh, you was for camera. He was
mighty skeptical. So he uh,

219
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,190
he actually went to Vienna,

220
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:40,350
visited cameras lab when camera wasn't
there and he makes a very careful study

221
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,530
of this hand. Andy, when he examined it,

222
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:48,460
he noticed that there
was a syringe hole there.

223
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,720
And he says this isn't a nuptial pad.

224
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:57,100
It looks darkened, but that's just ink.

225
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:02,350
What do you mean ink ink?
Like the big ink witting no,

226
00:14:02,351 --> 00:14:06,850
like India ink. What? No.
Yes, he doctored the toad.

227
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,880
That was the implication except camera
or tried to defend himself by saying,

228
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,490
do you think I'm a dumb cop or an idiot?

229
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:19,030
Because that's what I would have to be
if I left a forgery with ink standing

230
00:14:19,031 --> 00:14:22,840
around openly in the laboratory where
so many of my enemies would have entry.

231
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,510
So how did he explain it? Well,

232
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:29,790
he thought it might've been an assistant
trying to frame him because he was

233
00:14:30,251 --> 00:14:35,080
Jewish and you know, there was kind
of antisemitism growing at this time.

234
00:14:35,081 --> 00:14:40,081
So he thought that someone had framed
him and six weeks after a noble published

235
00:14:41,771 --> 00:14:46,771
his results in nature camera or sent a
letter to Moscow turning down a job that

236
00:14:48,241 --> 00:14:52,160
they'd offered him because
it would reflect badly on
the Soviet state. And then

237
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:57,310
following day camera puts on a suit and
he walks off into the mountains outside

238
00:14:59,301 --> 00:15:01,820
Vienna on a rocky mountain trail and

239
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,593
he shoots himself.

240
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:10,840
Chase Lamarckism

241
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,630
pretty much died there.

242
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:24,280
Uh, uh, uh,

243
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,620
uh, uh,

244
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:35,980
uh,

245
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,410
so then over the next 70 some odd years,

246
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:43,420
lamarck basically became the poster
boy for like the big dumb idea.

247
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,970
The idea that you want to believe in,

248
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,720
but that, you know, isn't true,
but, but, but there's, but there's,

249
00:15:50,721 --> 00:15:55,160
there's like some hope here because, um,
okay. All right. This is interesting.

250
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,690
Then Carl told us about this
research that showed that if,

251
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:05,060
if a mother really couldn't quite
remember the details does what a mother

252
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:09,510
imutual for Carl mouse or rat, I'm trying
to remember, was it rats or mice? No,

253
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:12,470
it's rats. Rats. Yup. We ended up
talking to the guy who did the work.

254
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,020
Michael Meaney I think. Yeah.

255
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,900
I'm a professor in the Faculty of
Medicine at McGill McGill University in

256
00:16:17,901 --> 00:16:22,760
Montreal. So here's the backstory. About
30 years ago, I was in undergraduates.

257
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,800
Michael was in school and
he got interested in a very,

258
00:16:24,801 --> 00:16:27,320
very basic question about
how things get passed down.

259
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:30,410
Like have you ever had one
of those moments where you
suddenly are your dad and

260
00:16:30,411 --> 00:16:33,140
it catches you off guard? Oh, of
course. I mean it's pretty common.

261
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,310
But like here's a, for instance,

262
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:37,790
my dad for my entire life had this
thing where if someone was whistling,

263
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,750
he'd be so, he would like,

264
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,600
they could be whistling six tables over
to a restaurant and he would turn around

265
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:43,190
and be like, stop that.

266
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,690
Like it was like it was scraping his
very nerves and the other day someone was

267
00:16:47,691 --> 00:16:50,720
whistling and I was like, stop it and
you just hit me. I was like, Oh God,

268
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:53,810
that was hit. It's never appeared
until now. And you went like,

269
00:16:53,811 --> 00:16:54,830
where did that come from?

270
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:58,400
Is that a genetic hatred of whistling
that I just had or did I somehow learn

271
00:16:58,401 --> 00:17:02,000
that that in a sort of ass backward
way was Michael's question,

272
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:05,750
how does that happen? How do these
simple little traits get passed forward?

273
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:11,310
So, so we started looking at
maternal care. Many years later,

274
00:17:11,311 --> 00:17:15,240
he and this woman, Francis Champagne,
who now works at Columbia University,

275
00:17:15,241 --> 00:17:18,630
they decided to explore this
question looking at in rats.

276
00:17:18,631 --> 00:17:22,320
So we have our rats in
the lab and they thought,

277
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,280
let's just see if we can figure out how
it is that rat mothers pass down their

278
00:17:26,281 --> 00:17:29,700
parenting skills. That's right.
If you were a great rat, mommy,

279
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,580
what would you be doing
with your rat baby?

280
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,820
You would be looking them quite a lot.
Uh, that's what good rap mothers do.

281
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,320
They look their babies
a lot, but she says,

282
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,640
you can tell right away just by looking
at some rat moms don't look their kids a

283
00:17:41,641 --> 00:17:43,560
lot. There's a normal distribution, right?

284
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,530
You got your good parents and you're bad
parents would they decided to do first

285
00:17:46,531 --> 00:17:50,220
was to try to figure out which rat
was which, which interestingly,

286
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,400
counting all the lists,

287
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,080
putting this into context,

288
00:17:53,081 --> 00:17:58,060
you know you have a rat mom and they
have about 16 to 20 babies all at once at

289
00:17:58,061 --> 00:18:01,420
once and we're watching
40 liters at a time.

290
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:04,370
How do you count those?
That's 40 that's too hard.

291
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:08,040
You have to look at one cage. Say,
are they liking? Yes. No. Okay.

292
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:11,940
Move on to the next cage. Yes. No,
move on to the next cage. Yes. No,

293
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,570
you have to do that for five hours
a day for six consecutive days.

294
00:18:15,571 --> 00:18:19,350
Move on to the next cage. Yes. No.
Move on to the next cage. Yes. No.

295
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,410
See, this is the story of science
that that doesn't get told no.

296
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:27,650
That just a mind crushing tedium.
Yes. Yeah. The next day. Yes. No.

297
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,130
Yeah. It drifts into something like
a shopping channel. In any case,

298
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:35,410
what they saw the end of all this
accounting was, well, first of all,

299
00:18:35,411 --> 00:18:38,920
what they saw was this pattern that rat
pups who got licked a lot as babies when

300
00:18:38,921 --> 00:18:39,754
they grew up,

301
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:43,750
they lick their babies a lot and the rat
pups who didn't get licked a lot when

302
00:18:43,751 --> 00:18:46,780
they grew up, they didn't
lick their babies a lot.

303
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,860
So the great rat nightmare comes true
with the females become their mothers.

304
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,433
Okay.

305
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:58,460
I think that makes a lot of
sense actually. It's kind
of obvious, right? Right.

306
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,940
Yeah. I mean we all kind of know this.
There are cycles of abuse or whatever.

307
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,380
You know, like if you're abused as a kid,

308
00:19:05,381 --> 00:19:08,470
you were more likely to abuse your
kid. But still you've got to wonder

309
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:12,730
why. Why would that happen?
How do those cycles perpetuate?

310
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,460
I mean like with the licking,
is it a teaching thing

311
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,551
where you know,

312
00:19:16,551 --> 00:19:20,030
the babies become good mothers because
they've learned it by watching their

313
00:19:20,031 --> 00:19:23,090
mothers, they've seen it and
they've repeated the experience,

314
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:28,240
or does it get passed on such a deep
level that doesn't even require teaching?

315
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,490
What do you mean?

316
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:33,580
So that's the reason of course that
we worked with rats because we can get

317
00:19:33,581 --> 00:19:34,540
inside the brain.

318
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:38,020
So Michael and Francis looked inside the
brains of these rats and what they saw

319
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,330
was that the rats had been
licked a lot as babies.

320
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:44,770
They had more stuff in their head. What
do you mean one more brains up more.

321
00:19:44,771 --> 00:19:46,600
What kind of stuff? It brings us more up.

322
00:19:46,601 --> 00:19:50,410
More of this particular kind of protein
that activates maternal behavior.

323
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,560
When rats have more of this protein,
they will act more monthly and they,

324
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,513
they had more.

325
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,130
So we'll think about what
makes proteins legit.

326
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:03,890
DNA. Well, yes. Genes and
DNA. Yeah. Don't you see some,

327
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,180
how the mother's tongue is getting all
the way down in there and going yeah.

328
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,980
Messing with the baby's DNA.
Is that what you're saying?

329
00:20:09,981 --> 00:20:13,990
That the licking is changing the
baby's DNA. That's what I know.

330
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,860
I'm quite saying that cause you
know that's, that's out again,

331
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,400
that's the rules against the rules.
You can't change your DNA. Yeah.

332
00:20:19,401 --> 00:20:21,070
You can't touch that.
It's off limits. Right.

333
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,900
But that tongue is doing
something to the DNA.

334
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,990
So what is the licking doing now?

335
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,530
That's, that's our challenge.

336
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:34,540
Do you have any theories for how this
tongue is tickling the DNA or whatever

337
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:37,750
it's doing? Um, well so then,

338
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,180
so what Michael just
launched into this thing.

339
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:44,830
What happens when moms lick their
pups is that the puppy comes aroused.

340
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:48,040
The reason they're more
aroused that the mom's

341
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,873
licking

342
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:55,140
activates the release of adrenaline
and noradrenaline in the pop,

343
00:20:55,570 --> 00:21:00,570
he says those two chemicals
kick off certain hormonal
systems and one of them is

344
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:03,880
called the thyroid system, right?

345
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,940
Hormones then get into the brain and they
turn on certain neurochemical signals

346
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:15,990
and the neurochemical signal that gets
activated during licking is Serotonin as

347
00:21:17,051 --> 00:21:18,490
in the mood chemical. Yep.

348
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:23,520
So mom's looking activates serotonin and
it's released onto brain cells in the

349
00:21:24,311 --> 00:21:28,930
hippocampus. You still with me, I think
I'm with you started with the tongue.

350
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:32,320
Four or five steps later.
We are in brain cells.

351
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:36,070
So almost instantaneously the mother's
tongue has reached into the baby's brain

352
00:21:36,071 --> 00:21:36,904
cells.

353
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:42,710
Now inside the cells in the center
coiled up little spools is the DNA.

354
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,910
So we're getting close to the
moment of truth gets there. It is.

355
00:21:45,911 --> 00:21:49,690
That's the stuff that makes you you,
but that you supposedly can't get to.

356
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:54,280
But here's what I did not know
about DNA. According to Francis,

357
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,710
it's not just sitting off.
They're perfectly preserved.

358
00:21:56,711 --> 00:21:58,660
It's in the middle of
the cell, it's crowded.

359
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:03,040
You've got all these chemicals
around racing by, you know,

360
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,770
in the south and very often
one of them will just go

361
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:08,750
crashing into [inaudible]

362
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,930
DNA and it'll stick there like a,

363
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,700
like a barnacle or a glob
of peanut butter. Exactly.
Peanut butter. There we go.

364
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:20,450
What will happen is it'll get stuck to
one little part of the DNA and now that

365
00:22:20,451 --> 00:22:23,030
little bit of DNA is
very difficult to get at.

366
00:22:23,031 --> 00:22:25,850
It's basically unusable because it's
got the thing stuck to it. Yeah,

367
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:28,790
and these things are called
apparently methyl groups.

368
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:32,030
Methyl groups are pretty
sticky. They're hard to get off.

369
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,340
So imagine the DNA in that brain cell.

370
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,470
All of these chemicals racing
by crashing into it sticking.

371
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:41,520
And one of the bits that gets covered
up is that little bit that makes the

372
00:22:41,521 --> 00:22:44,160
proteins that create a maternal instinct,

373
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:49,530
the bit of DNA that will give this baby
when it grows up instincts to be nice to

374
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,700
its baby and lick that. And you're saying
that part of the DNAs covered up? Yes.

375
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,830
And when methyl groups stick
to that part of the DNA,

376
00:22:55,831 --> 00:22:58,260
the maternal instinct is
effectively turned off.

377
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,000
But if you've got a mom who licks you,

378
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,650
mom's looking activate Serotonin,

379
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:08,410
serotonin gets into the brain
cells and according to Michael,

380
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,820
unleashes a whole series of
molecular events inside the cell.

381
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,900
The critical part of this is
that all these changes wake up,

382
00:23:16,901 --> 00:23:20,650
this little gang of proteins
known as transcription factors.

383
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:24,910
And if they see methyl groups sitting
on that bit of DNA, they are pissed.

384
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:28,960
And so they bring water friends to the
party, they all go down to the VNA,

385
00:23:28,961 --> 00:23:31,390
surround that methyl and just

386
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,230
knock it right off the DNA. That's it.

387
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:38,890
And then they're going to basically
rebel at that particular spot.

388
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:41,380
Turn on that gene.

389
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:46,130
So now the genes can make the proteins
that make the rats a good mom. Exactly.

390
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:50,090
Exactly. That was awesome. Wow.

391
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:54,710
That was amazing. Why? Why are you
so thrilled? Well, think about it.

392
00:23:54,711 --> 00:23:58,640
This is nature and nurture slamming into
each other. Like you know when people,

393
00:23:58,641 --> 00:24:00,950
smart people say, you know,
there's no such thing as nature.

394
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,630
Notice on the interaction
at the tail and you're like,

395
00:24:02,631 --> 00:24:04,840
what the hell does that mean?
Well, this is it, right?

396
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,450
This is real physical,

397
00:24:06,451 --> 00:24:11,040
chemical interaction between what's going
on in the environment and what's going

398
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:11,910
on with the DNA.

399
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:15,960
Because you begin with a mother's
lick that ends up with a deep,

400
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,140
deep change in the baby, not just
the good, warm, fuzzy feeling,

401
00:24:19,141 --> 00:24:20,640
but a fundamental shift.

402
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:26,520
Who that baby is and
who that baby will be.

403
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:32,030
You're now hearing the Mark's name invoked
these days because there are things

404
00:24:33,031 --> 00:24:36,180
beyond genes that we pass
down to our children.

405
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,610
No, according to Carl
[inaudible], gs are still fixed.

406
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,850
We can't rewrite our genes. That
is impossible so far as we know.

407
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:45,240
But there seems to be this
layer on top of the genes,

408
00:24:45,241 --> 00:24:49,050
this second channel of heredity.
If the genes are the bottom floor,

409
00:24:49,051 --> 00:24:52,560
then this layer on top is
sometimes called the Epi genome.

410
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:55,980
And that thing can change
based on your experiences,

411
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:59,820
which wouldn't you think about it?
It has a very lamarckian flavor.

412
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:04,630
Yeah. I think that's where the Mark's
ideas can be woven in and make some sense.

413
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,950
So do you call yourself a Lamarckian?
Not usually because it upsets people.

414
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,360
And I'm Canadian. I
don't like to [inaudible]

415
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,160
[inaudible] plus, you know,

416
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:15,620
the Marc didn't get all the
biological details right?

417
00:25:15,621 --> 00:25:19,100
I had no idea about DNA or very many
of them right at all. But you know,

418
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:21,110
his basic idea seems to be true.

419
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,710
I mean, when you think of camera,
there was a report in science, um,

420
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,920
outlining a theory about how cameras,

421
00:25:28,921 --> 00:25:33,030
toads got these characteristics
that invoked the,

422
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:36,750
these epigenetic inheritance
and, and imprinted genes.

423
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:40,440
And it made it plausible.
Oh, so redeeming him. Yeah.

424
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,260
Maybe or maybe not.

425
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,240
