00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.620
- [Instructor] Has the
girls on the ski team

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.520
every competed internationally?

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.960
So, has would work if we're
talking about one girl.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.390
If we said has the girl
competed internationally,

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.040
but we're talking about girls.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.390
This right over here is plural.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.060
Plural, plural.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.250
So, the form of has that we need is have.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.030
We need have.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.230
Have the girls on the ski team

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.180
ever competed internationally?

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.130
And if you want a good
way of checking this,

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.500
turn it from a question into a statement.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.470
Would you say the girls, the girls,

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.203
girls have, have competed?

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.160
Would you say this, or would
you say the girls has competed?

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.750
The girls has competed.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.080
No, the second one, the second one,

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.270
you have a, you have girls, that's plural,

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.900
but then you're using
the singular form of has.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:59.810
The girls has?

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.540
No, the girl has competed
or the girls have competed.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.030
So you definitely don't want to do this.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.210
You definitely don't want to do has.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.493
You want to use, we want to use have.
