00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[Norvig] And the answer is it will take about N squared on average.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
It will be more time proportional to N squared.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And the way you can see that is to think about how long it's going to take

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
to get the very last item of this swapped array filled in.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So say all the items are true all the way through,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
except there's 1 holdout that we haven't got yet. This one is still false.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
About how long will it take until we randomly choose a number

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
so that we can make this one be true?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And the answer is there's N of these.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And each time we're going through and we're generating indices,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
so it's going to take about N random numbers before we get that.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So for each of these N elements of the array

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
we can expect on average to take N or less.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
For the first one it will be easy.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The second one will be a little bit harder. The last few it will be harder still.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
But in the average case, the complexity is going to be on the order

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
of N times generating a random number for each of the N elements of that array

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
or order of N squared altogether.
