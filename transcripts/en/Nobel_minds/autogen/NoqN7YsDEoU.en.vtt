question to you my question is hi Peter
 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.450
question to you my question is hi Peter
so you're asking how strong is the

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460
so you're asking how strong is the
 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.359
so you're asking how strong is the
radiation of the Sun well that's a

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369
radiation of the Sun well that's a
 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:25.160
radiation of the Sun well that's a
interesting question the Sun radiates

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170
interesting question the Sun radiates
 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.620
interesting question the Sun radiates
light as you know in the visible

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630
light as you know in the visible
 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.800
light as you know in the visible
spectrum but also in the ultraviolet and

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810
spectrum but also in the ultraviolet and
 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.330
spectrum but also in the ultraviolet and
infrared and if you add up all that

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340
infrared and if you add up all that
 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.510
infrared and if you add up all that
radiation that hits the earth it turns

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520
radiation that hits the earth it turns
 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.470
radiation that hits the earth it turns
out that there's about a kilowatt or 1.4

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480
out that there's about a kilowatt or 1.4
 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.520
out that there's about a kilowatt or 1.4

lightbulbs on every square meter of the
 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.529
lightbulbs on every square meter of the
earth if you add up all the earth as a

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539
earth if you add up all the earth as a
 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.340
earth if you add up all the earth as a
as a big surface so if you add up all

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350
as a big surface so if you add up all
 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.950
as a big surface so if you add up all
the square meters on the surface of the

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960
the square meters on the surface of the
 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.210
the square meters on the surface of the
earth you get about a almost a Giga

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220
earth you get about a almost a Giga
 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.910
earth you get about a almost a Giga
gigawatt a gigawatt is a billion ten to

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920
gigawatt a gigawatt is a billion ten to
 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.300
gigawatt a gigawatt is a billion ten to
the nine watts and a Giga gigawatt is

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310
the nine watts and a Giga gigawatt is
 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.219
the nine watts and a Giga gigawatt is
about 10 to the 18 watts so that's a lot

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229
about 10 to the 18 watts so that's a lot
 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.330
about 10 to the 18 watts so that's a lot
of power now then you could you could

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340
of power now then you could you could
 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.399
of power now then you could you could
easily figure out knowing how far the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409
easily figure out knowing how far the
 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.190
easily figure out knowing how far the
earth is from the Sun and the fact that

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200
earth is from the Sun and the fact that
 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.450
earth is from the Sun and the fact that
the area of a sphere of radius R is 4 PI

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460
the area of a sphere of radius R is 4 PI
 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.749
the area of a sphere of radius R is 4 PI
R squared what the total amount of

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759
R squared what the total amount of
 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.300
R squared what the total amount of
radiation emitted from the Sun is and

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310
radiation emitted from the Sun is and
 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.649
radiation emitted from the Sun is and
another way of figuring that up by the

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659
another way of figuring that up by the
 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.330
another way of figuring that up by the
way is knowing that the temperature of

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340
way is knowing that the temperature of
 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.030
way is knowing that the temperature of
the Sun is around 6,000 degrees and the

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040
the Sun is around 6,000 degrees and the
 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.810
the Sun is around 6,000 degrees and the
Sun is a flat almost a blackbody and so

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820
Sun is a flat almost a blackbody and so
 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.300
Sun is a flat almost a blackbody and so
once you know its size and it's 10

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310
once you know its size and it's 10
 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.389
once you know its size and it's 10
sure you know how much power in radiates

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399
sure you know how much power in radiates
 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.280
sure you know how much power in radiates
so I'll leave that as an exercise to you

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290
so I'll leave that as an exercise to you
 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.100
so I'll leave that as an exercise to you
to do those calculations and find out

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110
to do those calculations and find out
 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.990
to do those calculations and find out
how much radiation how much energy per

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000
how much radiation how much energy per
 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.339
how much radiation how much energy per
second is emitted by the Sun but let me

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349
second is emitted by the Sun but let me
 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.420
second is emitted by the Sun but let me
get back to that first number about a

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430
get back to that first number about a
 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.910
get back to that first number about a
kilo watt per square meter of solar

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920
kilo watt per square meter of solar
 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.660
kilo watt per square meter of solar
energy is falling on the earth so we

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670
energy is falling on the earth so we
 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.089
energy is falling on the earth so we
could add it that up as we just did and

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099
could add it that up as we just did and
 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.210
could add it that up as we just did and
get about a gigawatt a Giga gigawatt of

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220
get about a gigawatt a Giga gigawatt of
 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.070
get about a gigawatt a Giga gigawatt of
of power that's a lot of power we could

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080
of power that's a lot of power we could
 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.330
of power that's a lot of power we could
compare that with how much power we use

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340
compare that with how much power we use
 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.729
compare that with how much power we use
as human beings you know we power our

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739
as human beings you know we power our
 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.470
as human beings you know we power our
automobiles that we power our houses we

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480
automobiles that we power our houses we
 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.440
automobiles that we power our houses we
have air conditioned and light and all

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450
have air conditioned and light and all
 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.470
have air conditioned and light and all
the electricity all the power that we as

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480
the electricity all the power that we as
 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.039
the electricity all the power that we as
human beings used adds up to about 20

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049
human beings used adds up to about 20
 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:06.259

terra watts that's about 20,000

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269
terra watts that's about 20,000
 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:12.080
terra watts that's about 20,000

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.210
gigawatts 20,000 gigawatts of energy
which is very small compared to a

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220
which is very small compared to a
 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.580
which is very small compared to a
billion gigawatts of energy so we only

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590
billion gigawatts of energy so we only
 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.190
billion gigawatts of energy so we only
use about one part in 20,000 of the

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200
use about one part in 20,000 of the
 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.000
use about one part in 20,000 of the
energy that the Sun deposits on the

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010
energy that the Sun deposits on the
 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.559
energy that the Sun deposits on the
earth now actually some of that energy

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569
earth now actually some of that energy
 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.319
earth now actually some of that energy
that falls on the earth is radiated out

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329
that falls on the earth is radiated out
 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.830
that falls on the earth is radiated out
and the greenhouse effect that is

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840
and the greenhouse effect that is
 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.410
and the greenhouse effect that is
causing all of our concern about global

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420
causing all of our concern about global
 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.840
causing all of our concern about global
warming is due to the fact that not

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850
warming is due to the fact that not
 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.530
warming is due to the fact that not
enough is radiating now and some of that

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540
enough is radiating now and some of that
 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.090
enough is radiating now and some of that
energy goes into creating a movement of

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100
energy goes into creating a movement of
 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.660
energy goes into creating a movement of
air and heating up the earth and making

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670
air and heating up the earth and making
 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.800
air and heating up the earth and making
the winds flow and but we could easily

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810
the winds flow and but we could easily
 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.280
the winds flow and but we could easily
capture much more than we do of that

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290
capture much more than we do of that
 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.040
capture much more than we do of that
solar energy and solve all of our energy

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050
solar energy and solve all of our energy
 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.310
solar energy and solve all of our energy
and perhaps that's the ultimate solution

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320
and perhaps that's the ultimate solution
 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.430
and perhaps that's the ultimate solution
to problems of energy consumption

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440
to problems of energy consumption
 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.930
to problems of energy consumption
without co2 admission just to tap a

small fraction of all that Norma's

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790
small fraction of all that Norma's
 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.180
small fraction of all that Norma's
amount of solar energy that's falling on

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190
amount of solar energy that's falling on
 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.840
amount of solar energy that's falling on
the earth so thanks for your question
