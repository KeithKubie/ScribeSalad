WE ARE IN DAY TWO OF OUR
CONTINUING COVERAGE OF THE

00:00:04.303 --> 00:00:05.338 align:start position:0% line:85%
UNREST IN BALTIMORE.

00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:07.607 size:78% position:39% line:91%
AND IT FEELS LIKE THERE'S
BEEN A LITTLE REST IN THE

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.675 size:88% position:44% line:85%
UNREST IN THE LAST 24 HOURS.

00:00:09.708 --> 00:00:12.545 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT YOU KNOW, I CAUGHT
SOMETHING ON CNN LAST NIGHT

00:00:12.578 --> 00:00:13.646 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT REALLY STOOD OUT.

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.316 size:84% position:42% line:91%
HERE'S A REPORT THAT AIRED
ABOUT TEN MINUTES AFTER THE

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:18.417 align:start position:0% line:85%
10 P.M. CURFEW.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.621 size:84% position:42% line:91%
SEE IF YOU NOTICE SOMETHING
MISSING FROM THIS PICTURE.

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:25.625 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND HINT, IT'S NOT MISSING
YET.

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:27.393 line:91%
&gt;&gt; WOULD YOU HAVE DONE IT? DO
YOU THINK THAT IS THE RIGHT

00:00:27.426 --> 00:00:28.160 align:start position:0% line:85%
THING?

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:29.195 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THERE IS NO EASY ANSWER
TO THAT.

00:00:29.228 --> 00:00:32.265 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHAT IT APPEARS TO BE THAT
BALTIMORE IS TRYING TO

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:34.300 align:start position:0% line:91%
DO-- IS DO SOMETHING A
LITTLE DIFFERENT HERE, NOT

00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:37.170 size:81% position:41% line:91%
BE AS CONFRONTATIONAL, BUT
OF COURSE, THEY KNOW THEY

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:38.304 size:88% position:44% line:85%
GOT TO GET THE MISSION DONE.

00:00:38.337 --> 00:00:41.808 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; OKAY, SO AT THIS POINT,
WHAT DO YOU DO?

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:43.976 align:start position:0% line:91%
DO YOU GO IN AND START
ARRESTING PEOPLE?

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:47.713 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I THINK THEY DO JUST WHAT
THEY'RE DOING RIGHT NOW.

00:00:47.746 --> 00:00:53.152 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; Larry: DID YOU SEE THAT?

00:00:53.185 --> 00:00:55.321 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE BROTHER JUST
DISAPPEARED.

00:00:55.354 --> 00:00:56.322 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU SAW THAT.

00:00:56.355 --> 00:00:58.925 size:75% position:38% line:91%
IT WAS A BROTHER WALKING
THERE, OKAY, WAIT, LET'S

00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.460 align:start position:0% line:91%
WATCH IT ONE MORE TIME,
OKAY?

00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:04.263 size:84% position:42% line:91%
ALL RIGHT THERE IS THE PAST
CURFEW BROTHER, HE IS JUST

00:01:04.296 --> 00:01:06.432 align:start position:0% line:91%
DOING A LITTLE HARMLESS COP
HASSLING.

00:01:06.465 --> 00:01:09.135 align:start position:0% line:91%
LOOK AT THIS, THAT IS A HUM
V BLOCKING THE CAMERA.

00:01:09.168 --> 00:01:11.037 align:start position:0% line:91%
GET OUT OF THE WAY, I CAN'T
SEE, I CAN'T SEE.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.839 size:81% position:41% line:85%
GET OUT-- OKAY, IT'S GONE.

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:15.475 align:start position:0% line:91%
OKAY, WHAT DID THEY DO TO
THE BROTHER?

00:01:15.508 --> 00:01:17.944 align:start position:0% line:85%
HE IS GONE!

00:01:17.977 --> 00:01:20.880 size:75% position:38% line:85%
THE BROTHER'S JUST GONE!

00:01:20.913 --> 00:01:24.217 align:start position:0% line:85%
OH MY GOD!

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.456 size:88% position:44% line:91%
WHAT THE-- NOW THAT IS SOME
GANGSTA [BLEEP] RIGHT THERE,

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:31.757 align:start position:0% line:85%
MAN.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.727 align:start position:0% line:91%
IF YOUR GANG IS CALLED THE
NATIONAL GUARD.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.028 size:88% position:44% line:85%
CALM DOWN, LARRY, CALM DOWN.

00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:39.699 size:84% position:42% line:91%
NOW IT LOOKS LIKE HE WAS
KIDNAPPED BUT IT TURNS OUT,

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:42.368 size:78% position:39% line:91%
THE HUM V BLOCK OUR VIEW
WHILE THE POLICE ARRESTED

00:01:42.401 --> 00:01:43.736 align:start position:0% line:85%
HIM AND TOOK HIM AWAY.

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:45.872 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT THE STORY IS NOT
ABOUT THE POLICE ARRESTING A

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:48.674 align:start position:0% line:91%
GUY WHO WAS OUT PAST HIS
CURFEW, OKAY.

00:01:48.707 --> 00:01:50.977 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE'RE TALKING SIMPLE OPTICS
HERE.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.180 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOW GUYS, DO YOU NOT
REMEMBER THAT BALTIMORE

00:01:54.213 --> 00:01:56.682 size:81% position:41% line:91%
ERUPTED BECAUSE OF HOW A
YOUNG BLACK MAN WAS KILLED

00:01:56.715 --> 00:01:59.552 align:start position:0% line:91%
IN A MYSTERIOUS POLICE VAN
RIDE.

00:01:59.585 --> 00:02:02.421 size:88% position:44% line:91%
THEN ON NATIONAL TELEVISION,
YOU HAVE A MYSTERIOUS POLICE

00:02:02.454 --> 00:02:07.293 align:start position:0% line:91%
VEHICLE SHOW UP AND
DISAPPEAR ANOTHER BROTHER.

00:02:07.326 --> 00:02:10.930 size:78% position:39% line:91%
YOU KNOW, BALTIMORE, WHEN
YOU ARE UNDER ATTACK FROM

00:02:10.963 --> 00:02:13.366 size:81% position:41% line:91%
VIOLATIONS OF CIVIL RIGHTS
IT'S PROBABLY BEST NOT TO

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:16.669 align:start position:0% line:91%
MANAGE THEM LIKE SOME KLAN
RALLY MAGICIAN.

00:02:16.702 --> 00:02:20.139 align:start position:0% line:91%
PRESTO CHANGEO NO MORE
NEGRO.

00:02:20.172 --> 00:02:22.942 line:85%
THAT IS JUST HORRIBLE OPTICS.

00:02:22.975 --> 00:02:24.143 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT'S JUST WRONG. AND IT DOES
NOTHING TO HELP 

00:02:24.176 --> 00:02:27.680 align:start position:0% line:91%
REPAIR THE FRACTURED
RELATIONSHIP

00:02:27.713 --> 00:02:29.215 align:start position:0% line:91%
BETWEEN BLACK FOLKS AND THE
POLICE.

00:02:29.248 --> 00:02:31.250 align:start position:0% line:85%
AND IT'S NOT JUST COPS.

00:02:31.283 --> 00:02:34.487 align:start position:0% line:91%
DON'T WORRY, DON'T WORRY,
IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY, RELAX,

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.455 align:start position:0% line:85%
RELAX.

00:02:35.488 --> 00:02:37.456 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOBODY IS GOING TO GET
DISAPPEARED, ALL RIGHT.

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.960 size:88% position:44% line:85%
THAT'S JUST OUR IRONY ALERT.

00:02:40.993 --> 00:02:43.262 align:start position:0% line:85%
THERE WE GO.

00:02:43.295 --> 00:02:47.833 size:88% position:44% line:91%
THE IRONY OF OUR IRONY ALERT
IS THAT IT TAKES A BEAT TO

00:02:47.866 --> 00:02:48.868 align:start position:0% line:85%
COME UP.

00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:50.469 align:start position:0% line:85%
ALL RIGHT.

00:02:50.502 --> 00:02:53.606 align:start position:0% line:91%
ALL RIGHT, OH, OH,
IRONY-- OKAY, HANG ON FOR

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:56.309 size:75% position:38% line:91%
SOME DRIPPING IRONY FROM
FORMER BALTIMORE RAVENS

00:02:56.342 --> 00:02:57.143 align:start position:0% line:85%
LINEBACKER RAY LEWIS.

00:02:57.176 --> 00:03:00.012 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; NO WAY THIS CAN HAPPEN IN
OUR CITY.

00:03:00.045 --> 00:03:02.548 align:start position:0% line:85%
GET OFF THE STREETS!

00:03:02.581 --> 00:03:03.883 size:84% position:42% line:85%
VIOLENCE IS NOT THE ANSWER.

00:03:03.916 --> 00:03:05.751 align:start position:0% line:91%
VIOLATION HAS NEVER BEEN THE
ANSWER.

00:03:05.784 --> 00:03:09.322 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:13.426 line:91%
VIOLENCE HAS NEVER BEEN THE
ANSWER, ONCE-ACCUSED MURDERER

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.828 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND PROFESSIONAL CONCUSSION
GIVER, YOU ARE RIGHT.

00:03:15.861 --> 00:03:17.897 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOW THE CITY IS TRYING TO
MOVE ON.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.032 align:start position:0% line:91%
THERE ARE A LOT OF HOPEFUL
IMAGES.

00:03:20.065 --> 00:03:23.202 size:88% position:44% line:91%
MORE THAN 10,000 PEOPLE HAVE
BEEN PEACEFULLY PROTESTING.

00:03:23.235 --> 00:03:25.438 align:start position:0% line:91%
EVEN OLDER CITIZENS HAVE
STOOD UP FOR THEIR

00:03:25.471 --> 00:03:26.472 align:start position:0% line:85%
NEIGHBORHOODS.

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:28.975 size:78% position:39% line:91%
NOW LOOK, GUYS, I KNOW WE
NEED TO MOVE FORWARD AND

00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:30.009 align:start position:0% line:85%
FOCUS ON THE FUTURE.

00:03:30.042 --> 00:03:31.043 align:start position:0% line:85%
I GET THAT.

00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:33.846 size:81% position:41% line:91%
BUT I DON'T THINK WE CAN
FULLY MOVE FORWARD ON THIS

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:35.414 size:78% position:39% line:85%
ISSUE UNTIL WE LOOK BACK.

00:03:35.447 --> 00:03:42.054 size:88% position:44% line:91%
BECAUSE YOU KNOW, WE'RE TIED
TO A-- LIKE A BIG-ASS ROCK

00:03:42.087 --> 00:03:48.194 size:84% position:42% line:91%
AND THE ROCK IS LIKE-- IT'S
A RACIST ROCK, WHICH-- NOW,

00:03:48.227 --> 00:03:50.463 align:start position:0% line:91%
ITS-- OKAY, LOOK, THE
METAPHOR ISN'T IMPORTANT,

00:03:50.496 --> 00:03:51.230 align:start position:0% line:85%
ALL RIGHT?

00:03:51.264 --> 00:03:53.132 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
BUT WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS

00:03:53.165 --> 00:03:56.302 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT THERE ARE SOME VERY
REAL ISSUES THAT NEED TO GET

00:03:56.335 --> 00:03:57.470 align:start position:0% line:91%
ADDRESSED BEFORE ANYONE
MOVES ON.

00:03:57.503 --> 00:04:00.072 size:88% position:44% line:91%
FOR INSTANCE, IT'S BEEN MORE
THAN TWO WEEKS AND WE STILL

00:04:00.105 --> 00:04:02.408 size:81% position:41% line:91%
DON'T HAVE ANSWERS ON WHAT
HAPPENED TO FREDDIE GRAY.

00:04:02.441 --> 00:04:05.511 size:88% position:44% line:91%
ONE FACT THAT HAS EMERGED IS
THAT HE WAS ONLY THE LATEST

00:04:05.544 --> 00:04:08.047 size:88% position:44% line:91%
PERSON TO GO TOE-TO-TOE WITH
THE BALTIMORE POLICE VAN AND

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.181 align:start position:0% line:85%
LOSE.

00:04:09.215 --> 00:04:10.916 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF
ATTENTION GIVEN TO WHAT HAS

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:13.319 align:start position:0% line:91%
BEEN CALLED QUOTE A ROUGH
RIDE.

00:04:13.352 --> 00:04:15.988 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; A WOMAN SAYS COPS
HANDCUFFED HER.

00:04:16.021 --> 00:04:18.624 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE DRIVER WAS SLAMMING ON
THE BRAKES TO RAM HER

00:04:18.657 --> 00:04:20.593 align:start position:0% line:91%
AGAINST THE INSIDE OF THE
VEHICLE.

00:04:20.626 --> 00:04:23.562 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I TELL YOU WHEN A COP IS
SLAMMING ME AROUND IN THE

00:04:23.595 --> 00:04:25.965 align:start position:0% line:91%
BLACK OF THE POLICE VAN
TRYING TO SERIOUSLY INJURE

00:04:25.998 --> 00:04:29.068 align:start position:0% line:91%
ME, THAT DRIVER IS
DEFINITELY ONLY GET GETTING

00:04:29.101 --> 00:04:30.269 align:start position:0% line:85%
TWO STARS.

00:04:30.302 --> 00:04:32.138 align:start position:0% line:91%
DAMMIT, THAT'S UBER. IT WOULD BE
COOL IF WE WERE ABLE TO RATE

00:04:32.171 --> 00:04:36.709 align:start position:0% line:91%
COPS IN AN APP, THOUGH. IT IS
HARD TO

00:04:36.742 --> 00:04:39.779 align:start position:0% line:91%
COMPLAIN ABOUT YOUR ROUGH
RIDE WHEN YOUR DRIVER HAS, I

00:04:39.812 --> 00:04:42.581 align:start position:0% line:91%
DON'T KNOW, KILLED YOU?
&gt;&gt; BALTIMORE POLICE ARRESTED

00:04:42.614 --> 00:04:45.551 align:start position:0% line:91%
A MAN FOR PUBLIC URINATION
IN 2005.

00:04:45.584 --> 00:04:48.988 align:start position:0% line:91%
DIDN'T BUCKLE HIS SEAT BELT,
THEN TOOK A HARD TURN.

00:04:49.021 --> 00:04:50.923 align:start position:0% line:91%
DOCTORS SAY HIS SPINE WAS
DISLOCATED.

00:04:50.956 --> 00:04:52.725 align:start position:0% line:85%
HE LATER DIED.

00:04:52.758 --> 00:04:54.160 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THIS IS DISGUSTING,
GUYS.

00:04:54.193 --> 00:04:57.463 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND THIS IS THE EXACT SAME
THING THAT HAPPENED TO

00:04:57.496 --> 00:04:59.799 align:start position:0% line:91%
FREDDIE GRAY, TEN YEARS
LATER.

00:04:59.832 --> 00:05:01.600 align:start position:0% line:91%
LOOK BALTIMORE POLICE,
KILLING PEOPLE IN THE VAN IS

00:05:01.633 --> 00:05:05.438 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOT THE SPIDER-MAN ORIGIN
STORY, YOU DO NOT NEED TO DO A

00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:08.808 align:start position:0% line:91%
GRITTY REBOOT EVERY FEW YEARS,
ACTUALLY HOLLYWOOD, THAT

00:05:08.841 --> 00:05:11.744 align:start position:0% line:91%
GOES FOR THE ACTUAL
SPIDER-MAN ORIGIN STORY,

00:05:11.777 --> 00:05:12.878 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHILE WE'RE AT IT.

00:05:12.911 --> 00:05:15.081 align:start position:0% line:91%
APPARENTLY BALTIMORE HAS HAD
TO PAY OUT A TON OF MONEY

00:05:15.114 --> 00:05:17.650 align:start position:0% line:91%
BECAUSE THEY JUST CAN'T STOP
MISCONDUCTING.

00:05:17.683 --> 00:05:22.388 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE CITY HAS MADE MORE
THAN $5.7 MILLION DOLLARS IN

00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:25.157 align:start position:0% line:91%
JUDGEMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS
FOR ALLEGED POLICE

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:26.258 align:start position:0% line:85%
MISCONDUCT.

00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:28.728 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THIS INCLUDES SIX FIGURE
SETTLEMENTS FOR ALLEGEDLY

00:05:28.761 --> 00:05:30.463 align:start position:0% line:91%
SLAMMING A PREGNANT WOMAN TO
THE GROUND.

00:05:30.496 --> 00:05:32.765 align:start position:0% line:91%
FOR KILLING AN UNARMED
MARINE VETERAN.

00:05:32.798 --> 00:05:36.235 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND FOR BEATING A CHURCH
DEACON.

00:05:36.268 --> 00:05:38.537 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: JESUS, BALTIMORE
PD, A PREGNANT WOMAN, A VET

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:39.872 align:start position:0% line:85%
AND A CHURCH DEACON?

00:05:39.905 --> 00:05:43.342 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT IS LIKE THE HOLY
TRINITY OF SYMPATHETIC

00:05:43.375 --> 00:05:44.410 align:start position:0% line:85%
VICTIMS.

00:05:44.443 --> 00:05:47.313 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHY NOT SHUT DOWN THE
SPECIAL OLYMPICS FOR NOISE

00:05:47.346 --> 00:05:49.882 align:start position:0% line:91%
VIOLATION AND MAKE IT AN
EVEN FOUR.

00:05:49.915 --> 00:05:51.517 align:start position:0% line:85%
GOOD LORD.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.586 size:81% position:41% line:85%
I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE THIS.

00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:56.489 size:84% position:42% line:91%
NOW LOOK, THE PROBLEMS WITH
THE POLICE ARE VERY BAD.

00:05:56.522 --> 00:05:58.491 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT IT IS JUST ONE ITEM ON
THE LIST.

00:05:58.524 --> 00:06:01.961 size:75% position:38% line:91%
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN
THIS AREA IS 52 PERCENT,

00:06:01.994 --> 00:06:04.864 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND THE MEDIUM INCOME IN
FREDDIE GRAY'S NEIGHBORHOOD IS

00:06:04.897 --> 00:06:06.565 align:start position:0% line:91%
