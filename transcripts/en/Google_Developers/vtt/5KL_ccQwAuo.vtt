00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.470
interesting developer community.

SUSANNAH RAUB: I'm
glad somebody

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.510
has asked this question.

-Hello, and welcome to this
week's Chrome Apps Hangout!

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.830
Glad you joined us.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.220
Today, we're going to cover
the Text-to-Speech API.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.340
With that, I'd like to invite
Pete LePage to join us and get

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.590
things started!

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.970
[END AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.160
PETE LEPAGE: Well
hey, everybody.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.280
My name's Pete LePage.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.310
I'm a developer advocate with
the Chrome Team working on

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.590
Chrome Apps.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.960
Today, I want to talk to you
about the Text-To-Speech API,

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.070
one of the cool new
APIs that are

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.790
available with Chrome Apps.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.290
As you saw, we had a little demo
there that took what I

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.060
had to say, used the
Text-To-Speech API and was

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:09.090
able to convert that from
text into the speech.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.750
So you can use this for
all kinds of different

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:12.860
applications.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.500
Whether you want to have a
clock that talks to you,

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.020
whether you want to have an
application that alerts you

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.820
when you get new text messages,
or anything else

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.940
that you might want to have
a voice coming out of your

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.700
computer for any kind
of experience.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.940
So with that, I figure we might
as well just jump in and

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.910
have a look at the
application.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.620
So let's bring up some
code and the app.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.580
So here, we've got
the application.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.210
Let me just move my computer
to a place where I can more

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.010
easily access it here.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.540
And you'll notice that there's
a couple of things in this

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.220
text box that I've got going.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.330
I've got a text box that
I can edit in here.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.670
So I can say, the
rain in Spain.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.190
Spain stays mainly
in the plain.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.730
Right?

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.320
And I can click on
the Speak button.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.870
Sure enough--

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:10.850
It helps if I turn
the volume up.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:11.050
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.325

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.860

try that again.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.212

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.560
PETE LEPAGE: So we've got
it saying whatever

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.810
we want it to say.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.820
As well as it says each part,
you'll notice that it

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.230
highlights the words
that it's saying.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.600
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.370

mainly in the plain.

[END AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.630
PETE LEPAGE: Ah, helps
if I remember to put

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.960
my extra S on there.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.850
But it says the words that it's

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.820
speaking as it moves through.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.680
So I'm going to walk you through
how I went about going

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.810
and using the Text-To-Speech
API, but as well, how I went

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.470
and got it to highlight the
different words as it moved

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.650
through the different pieces.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.060
So let's bring up some code here
and, before we jump into

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.870
the actual app, let's
take a look at the

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.850
code behind the app.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.130
So I started, in this particular
case, with just the

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.850
simple Hello, World example
because I figured that was the

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.630
easiest place for me
to get started.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.110
It was just a nice,
easy place to go.

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.630
I used the Bootstrap UI to make
things look kind of nice,

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.050
as just a starting place.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.600
Just a real easy thing.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.890
So you can see here, I've got
the Bootstrap CSS framework,

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.100
and then I've got my own custom
set of styles so that I

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.630
can have a certain set
of things in there.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.860
If we have a look at that custom
set of styles, all I've

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.810
gone and done is I just put
some special styling on my

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.540
container so that I'd have just
enough for that top block

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.390
to be there.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.420
And as well, I created
this highlight class.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.270
The highlight class
is what's actually

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.750
highlighting each word.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.620
So each word, when it gets
highlighted, has that class

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.730
added to it and removed
from it.

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.190
So that's the CSS behind this.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.240
If we go back and have a look
at the application, you can

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.945
ignore this top little bit.

00:04:13.945 --> 00:04:17.970
This is where we've got the
toolbar across the top.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.019
So if I bring the app
back up here.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.470
Let me just bring it
up here real quick.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.870
Right so, here we go.

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.220
There's my top navbar
so that you can see

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.650
what's going on there.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.690
I didn't do anything special
with it because I just wanted

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.860
to get something in
really quickly.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.590
But then here in my container,
I've done a couple of things.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.960
So I've got a form element that
I've said form inline.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.250
So that styles the Bootstrap
stuff, so that I've got my

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.860
text in line with the button.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.510
Now I've got my text input here,
and I've set it so that

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.510
it's a type text.

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.480
And I've given it an ID because
I'm going to need to

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.120
grab it in a second.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:06.690
I've specified how big I
want the input to be.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.190
And I've also put in a little
place holder, so that if we go

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.680
and get rid of any of the text
in here, we always will see

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.360
"say something" so that we
know that that's where we

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.930
should go type and provide
our information.

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.850
I've got a button that, by
default, is disabled.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.300
We'll talk about why I've
got it disabled to

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.210
begin with in a sec.

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.960
And it's type button
with an ID.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.920
And the class button is what
defines the styling for the

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.510
Bootstrap button.

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.800
And then a little bit further
down, I have a paragraph where

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.510
I've actually gone in to find
all of my word lists.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.030
So this is where we're going
to go in and insert all the

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.540
words as we start iterating
through these.

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.110
Let's take a quick look at the
manifest file, because the

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.300
manifest file is
pretty simple.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.980
There's nothing really complex
to it or anything like that.

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.730
It's a pretty standard
manifest file.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:11.180
Again, I just grabbed this from
the Hello, World sample.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.320
The only thing that really
changes that I want to

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.480
highlight here is in the
permissions element.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.190
So in the permissions element,
what I've done is I've added

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.640
permissions for TTS,
so Text-To-Speech.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.660
And that's the Chrome
Text-To-Speech element.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.100
The only other thing that I
did was I moved my main.js

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.570
into a JavaScript folder because
I like to keep all my

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.690
JavaScript off into its own
little space so that it's not

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.590
sitting in my root
of the directory.

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.190
So if we actually look at that,
you could see it's just

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.510
a standard main.js.

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:50.470
We go and create a window that
opens index at about 500

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:55.790
pixels wide and 309
pixels in height.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.640
So that's going to go
and open our window.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.500
It's going to give us our
Text-To-Speech permission.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.220
So we're pretty much good
to go at this point.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:11.050
So at this point, let's go and
actually take a look at what's

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.200
going on with our code.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:18.310
But before I do that, I want
to mention that, as with

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:21.000
pretty much all of our Chrome
Hangouts, if you have

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.250
questions, if you've got
comments, if you want to know

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:26.030
what's going on with some of
these, feel free to post your

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.580
questions at our
moderator page.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.250
The link is there onscreen.

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.030
I'll leave it onscreen for the
next couple minutes so that as

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:36.200
I'm walking through this, you
can go ahead and post your

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.270
questions and ask
what's going on.

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:40.900
All right.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.580
Now, I kind of put this example
together in a quick

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.820
and dirty fashion, and some
of the things I did here I

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.700
wouldn't recommend doing
for a production app.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.550
But it at least gives you a good
idea of how to go about

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:55.180
doing some of these things.

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.970
So I created three variables,
because I was going to need to

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:00.970
access these fairly
frequently.

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:06.860
So my speakInput, which is my
text box, my btnSpeak, which

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.670
is the button that the user
clicks when they want to go

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:12.210
and hit a button, and
then the wordList.

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:16.580
So that's the paragraph
that we've got.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:22.160
And in my jQuery Document Ready
function, I go and I

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.000
just grab those right
off the bat.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.200
So that way I've always
got them.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.490
I don't have to go keep
searching for them every time

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:30.600
the user hits a button,
or anything like that.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.860
It's a good performance
technique.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:36.020
Obviously, in something like
this, it's maybe not the most

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:39.030
important thing to have because
this is such a simple

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:41.909
example, but I wanted to
just go stick this in

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:44.540
there, and go from that.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:50.870
So I go and grab my speakInput,
which is the text

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:55.250
box, I grab the button, and
I grab the wordList.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:58.150
And then I bind with a click.

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:03.670
So when the user clicks on the
button, they actually go in

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:07.040
and call the saySomething
function.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:10.740
Now the other thing that I did
is I added a removeAttr

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.240
disabled here.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.010
So that way, that button is
not enabled until our

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:17.260
document's ready.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.880
The user is not going to be able
to do something before

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.890
your UI is ready, so disabling
buttons when they're not

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:31.990
available is just one of those
things that generally is a

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:35.590
good practice, good thing
to keep an eye on.

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:39.500
So now let's take a look at
our saySomething function.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.250
So this is the function that
gets called when the user goes

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:43.760
and clicks on Say Something.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:51.891
So let me pop over here,
and when I say, yes--

00:09:51.891 --> 00:09:52.340
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:52.700
-Yes.

[END AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:55.130
PETE LEPAGE: --sure
enough, that's the

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:56.600
function that gets called.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.790
So let's take a look.

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:04.290
So the first thing I wanted to
do is get my list of words.

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:08.880
So I just go and use the val
from the input, and I just put

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.920
all of those words
into an array.

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:18.390
And I split those into
an array of words.

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:21.320
Now, I split them into an
array of words because I

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:26.210
wanted to know where all the
different words existed.

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:29.230
So that as I went through and
highlighted each, as the

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:32.520
computer said each word, I
could highlight each one.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.470
So actually I'm going to go and
I'm going to stick in a

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:42.170
console.log, "Words," colon,
and we'll add words.

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.610
Just so that when we have a look
this here in a sec, we

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:46.890
can see what's going on.

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:51.580
So the next thing that happens
is that I take the wordList,

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.280
and I get rid of everything
in there.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.950
Because we don't care what was
in there before, so we want to

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:58.690
go through and clear
everything out.

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:04.330
And then I want to go through,
and I add all of the words

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.960
into a span.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:16.460
So each word becomes its own
span inside my wordList.

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:19.170
So I go through and add each
of those guys in there.

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:23.750
And I just say, span, word,
text, go in, stick each one

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:26.530
in, and then append
it to my wordList.

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:31.180
Now, probably not the best way
to do this because in this

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:36.380
particular case, I am having
to refer to that each one.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:41.130
And going in and appending, and
appending, and appending,

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:46.120
and appending ends up being a
pretty expensive DOM task.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.850
The better way to do this would
have been to create an

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:53.820
element that I would have
wrapped everything in, put

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:57.030
everything into that particular
element, and then

00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:02.520
just added that one single
element to my page.

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.570
Depending on how much time we
have, we might go in and add

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:07.620
that in a sec.

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:11.860
So now I use the Chrome
Text-To-Speech API.

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.310
And the Chrome Text-To-Speech
API, let me just pull that guy

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:16.250
out for a sec here.

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:19.870
You can get the documentation
for the Chrome Text-To-Speech

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:24.540
API here if you go
and look at that.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:26.790
But there's a couple of things
that you can do with this.

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:31.250
So the easiest API that you can
use is chrome.tts.speak

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.120
and you provide it
with a string.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:38.100
And it goes and it'll say
whatever you wanted it to say.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.780
It's an asynchronous call.

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:40.640
Keep that in mind.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.180
So that you say, hey, I want
you to go say this.

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:46.280
And it's going to immediately
come back and say, OK, great

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.410
I'm saying this.

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:49.870
And the rest of your JavaScript
is running.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:52.170
So that means you're
not waiting for

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:53.960
it to finish speaking.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:58.540
It also means that you can use
this text-to-speech stop to

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:00.170
stop it from saying anything.

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:03.090
If it's still continually
talking and you're like, oh

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:05.950
hey, I don't want you to
keep talking anymore,

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:07.690
you can have it stop.

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:12.010
But then there's a bunch of
functions and parameters that

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:12.730
you can provide.

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:16.100
And the interesting one
that I used, was

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.600
the callback function.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.530
So let me actually
go back to here.

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:23.290
So you can see here we said
Chrome Text-To-Speech toSay,

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:28.680
which is the list of words that
we want the user to say.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.010
Right?

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:33.570
And then I provided a couple
of parameters.

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:37.230
So one parameter I provided
was the rate.

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:40.440
So 1.0 would be a normal pace.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.520
Increasing that to a higher
number will be

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:44.940
have them speak faster.

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:47.310
Decreasing that number,
they're going to speak

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:53.240
(SPEAKING SLOWLY) more slowly,
and they're not going to sound

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.180
very interesting.

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:59.210
So I thought that 1.0 actually
sounded a little too fast, so

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:03.270
that's why I put
it down at 0.8.

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:07.640
Now, the next piece I added
was an onEvent function.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:11.360
The onEvent function fires under
a number of different

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.270
events, but the one that I
thought was the coolest was

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:15.550
the word function.

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:19.870
So on every word that
Chrome says, it

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:23.030
fires this word function.

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:30.510
So I checked to see what the
word function is, and go in

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:34.970
and add that and check
to see if it's there.

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:38.120
It comes back and it gives me
the character index of where

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:41.090
that word is.

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:43.670
So that I can see OK,
well, this is--

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:46.060
it's starting at this character,
or this character

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.680
as it says something.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:54.030
Then I find all spans that have
the highlight, and I want

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:55.130
to go and remove them.

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:59.240
Because I'm not interested in
highlighting anything else.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:03.300
I only want to highlight
the active word.

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:07.310
Now, this is one place where I
got a little goofed up when I

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:09.090
first did this.

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:12.190
Actually, let's take a look
at what I just added here,

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:16.140
because the words that
I split out don't

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.900
actually split by word.

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:22.160
It actually splits
by character.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.050
So if I pull this
guy up-- whoop.

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:26.070
I guess I have to do these.

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:26.510
All right.

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:33.130
So let's pull this up again,
and let's reload this.

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:38.810
And we'll have a look at
what's going on here.

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:40.060
And--

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:43.140
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.190

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:45.520
[END AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:46.410
PETE LEPAGE: So sure enough,
there's the rain in Spain

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:47.880
stays mainly in the plain.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:52.010
You'll notice that it's
broken down each

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:55.090
letter into each piece.

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:59.840
Now the reason I had to break
down each letter, is that

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:03.550
Chrome considers words to be
something that I didn't

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:05.460
consider words to be.

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:08.930
Chrome considers words to be
what I would traditionally

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:09.980
consider a word.

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:13.090
But a comma is considered
a word.

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:17.650
So if you'll notice just that
simple "the rain in Spain," it

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:20.580
thinks that is a word.

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:24.310
So what I went and did is I
said, OK, well we need to just

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:29.100
highlight each piece until
we find the end of what I

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:30.460
consider to be a word.

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:34.950
So let me pop back
to our code here.

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:44.000
And I go through and I say,
while we're in a word, add the

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.700
highlight to that word.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:51.650
And we do it by the index.

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:57.200
And we keep going until either
we find the end of the string,

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:00.430
or we find a space at
the end of our text.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:07.319
So if words start is undefined,
or if words start

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:14.410
dot text equals space, then
we've finished with our word.

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:20.900
So if we do that, that breaks
down each individual word.

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:25.099
Once we hit the end, we're
going to finish with the

00:17:25.099 --> 00:17:27.640
particular space.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:31.016
So let's actually go in and
console.log(event).

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:39.060
So that we can see what's being
passed in, and how each

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:42.700
word comes in and how
long each word is.

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.700
All right.

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:49.170
And then we've just got an empty
function for any kind

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:50.440
errors or anything like that.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:57.470
So I'm going to save this guy,
and we'll reload this.

00:17:57.470 --> 00:18:04.350
And Inspect, so that we bring
up for our console.

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:08.520
And bring up our Developer
Console, and go ahead and

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.100
Speak this.

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:14.720
Now, I've got it muted so that
you don't hear each piece, but

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.930
let me move this in so
that you can see this

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.560
a little bit better.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.070
OK, we'll do that.

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:26.540
And sure enough.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:33.010
So you can see we've got an
object that's the start with

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:35.090
our character index of 0.

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:36.780
There's no error message.

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:40.230
Then the second one, we
start our first word.

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:43.500
And our first word goes
from 0 to something.

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.190
It doesn't actually tell
us where it ends.

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:49.990
And then our second word
starts at character 4.

00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:56.700
OK, so there is character
0, 1, 2, 3, and so sure

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.810
enough there's 4.

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:03.510
Let me bring up a slightly
different example, where we

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:05.620
can see this a little
bit more clearly.

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:08.290
So I'm going to put a comma
right in the very beginning.

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:14.600
Hello, world.

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:15.850
Of course.

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:19.330
So sure enough--

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:21.450
I'm just going to clear my
console here, so we can see

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:22.670
this a little bit better.

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:26.930
So "Hello, world."

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:31.490
So sure enough, you see right
off the bat we have start, we

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:34.840
have hello at 0.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:41.050
We have word at 5 characters,
so that we can go in, and we

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:46.810
can go to our 5 characters
in, which is the comma.

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:50.180
And then world starts at 7.

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:56.320
So we've got, "Hello, world."
We start with our next word.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:58.190
We highlight the next
thing and highlight

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:00.580
that as it goes on.

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:03.510
So you can see it's a pretty
simple example to be able to

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:06.620
go through and highlight each
of the sets of words, as we

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.850
move through.

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:12.450
And it's a pretty quick, easy
way to be able to go in and

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:17.370
say, all right, well, I want
something to go to speak, or I

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:22.890
want something to be able to go
and add in whatever else is

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:24.570
we particularly want.

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:27.380
Now it looks like our friend
Renato has just joined us.

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:29.970
So I'm going to bring
Renato in here.

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:31.420
One second.

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:38.770
Let me just close something up
real quick, and bring him in.

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:42.950
And Renato, how you doing?

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:49.695
I'm not hearing you there.

00:20:49.695 --> 00:20:50.945
Yeah.

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:55.120
All right.

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:01.170
One sec, let me see if I can
change something real fast.

00:21:14.236 --> 00:21:15.770
All right.

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:20.450
Looks like I'm not hearing
Renato right now, so we'll

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:25.930
have Renato join us on another
Hangout on a future date.

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:30.010
So with that, I want to open
it up to any questions that

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:30.520
you guys have.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.740
Actually, before I do
that, what I'll do--

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:35.770
the sample that I wrote, you
can go and grab that.

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:37.740
The link is onscreen.

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:42.260
If you want to go in and pull
that up so that you can try

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:43.390
this out yourself.

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:44.290
See how it works.

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:47.540
It's just up on my
GitHub account.

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:52.450
You can go and grab that
from there, and see how

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:53.710
it works for you.

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:58.020
But with that, I'll open
it up to questions.

00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:02.950
Let me pull them up, and see
if we've got any good, fun

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:04.966
questions for us this week.

00:22:04.966 --> 00:22:06.216
All right.

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:19.790
All right, so we've got a
couple questions here.

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:23.370
So the first question, "Since
this is a Chrome API, does it

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:25.050
only work with the
Chrome browser.

00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:31.090
Or if I had to format it in
HTML, would it also work in

00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:31.940
Safari?"

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:35.470
So this is a particular feature
of Chrome Apps.

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:41.120
So it's not going to work in
Safari, or in Firefox, or

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:41.780
anything like that.

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:45.260
It's got to be within a Chrome
app, or it can also work in a

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:48.530
Chrome extension as
well, I believe.

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:49.800
Pretty sure about that one.

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.600
I haven't used that one
in a little while.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.790
But you can use that
within Chrome Apps.

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:58.935
There is a new Text-To-Speech
API.

00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:05.610
It's either a Text-To-Speech API
or Speech-To-Text API that

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:08.520
just landed as part of the Open
Web Platform, that you

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:11.640
may be able to use
and check out.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:15.330
It's a pretty useful one and
really kind of cool.

00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:20.060
Because it will allow you to
do a lot of things that

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:23.350
developers have been asking for
for quite some time and

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:26.410
just simply haven't been able
to do with the stuff that

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:29.370
they've got going on.

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:34.060
So let's see if there's
another question here.

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:36.070
All right.

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:40.220
So the next question is, "Where
are some of the things

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:44.850
you would might run into
problems when using this?"

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:48.800
So the couple of things that
I ran into when I was doing

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:54.890
this, one was really around
the piece of understanding

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:56.590
which words are coming out.

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:59.140
Because it only gives you
that start piece.

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:02.930
And the things that Chrome
thinks are words, like a

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:06.330
comma, a period, perhaps
a new paragraph.

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:11.710
I actually didn't try
that in my code.

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:15.950
Those may come across as
something a little bit odd.

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:19.630
So you'll need to experiment
with those a little bit.

00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:21.860
The other thing that you'll just
have to make sure that

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:27.510
you do is make sure that you've
got the Chrome TTS API

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:33.800
enabled, so that way you
can go and use this.

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:38.680
In fact, let me bring up the
docs again, one sec.

00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:47.350
So if you have a look here in
the docs, it does go through

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:51.510
and have a pretty good set of
documentation about some of

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:54.470
the other things that
you can do.

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:57.020
So it talks about the listening
for events with the

00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:58.680
different pieces.

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:05.490
Unfortunately, I couldn't get
in Chrome Canary the SSML

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:06.770
markup to work.

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:10.240
I'm going to go check to see if
that was a problem with my

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:13.540
implementation, or if that's
maybe a bug in Chrome.

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:14.670
And file a bug.

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:20.960
So just keep an eye out on our
Google Developers page for a

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:24.070
little bit more information
about that.

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:26.490
One of the other things that I
thought was kind of neat that

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:31.000
you can do is actually be able
to go and choose a couple of

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.250
different voices.

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:38.400
So you heard when I
did it earlier.

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:43.850
Let me pull this guy out to see
if I could find this and

00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:44.870
bring it up.

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:45.170
Right?

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:49.750

[END AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:53.720
PETE LEPAGE: You hear "hello,
world." It's there.

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:57.180
It kind of sounds like
a robotic male voice.

00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:01.460
It's not exactly very great to
be able to tell what's going

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:03.590
on or anything like that.

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:07.530
With something like that, what
you could do is change to a

00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:10.390
different voice.

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:17.400
Now, when I ran through the
sample code here, again, it

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.970
turned out that on my particular
computer, I

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:22.070
couldn't get it to come up
with many other voices.

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:24.100
It only had the one
default voice.

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:27.780
So it depends on the different
computer that you've got what

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:31.070
voices you may have access to,
and whether you can change

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:34.360
from a male to a female, whether
you can maybe add a

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:39.430
British accent, or Canadian
accent, where everybody says

00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:43.360
"oot and aboot." That
kind of fun stuff.

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:48.250
So it's a quick easy way to be
able to change the accents and

00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:49.550
that kind of stuff.

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:50.800
All right.

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:59.360
So with that, it's a pretty
simple sample.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:04.360
And let me put the link it up
again so that we can see, and

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:06.840
you can grab that if you want.

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:15.940
But the sample code is there
at goo.gl/PJSdM And you can

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:16.840
grab that code.

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:18.090
You can go play with it.

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:23.620
Jim's just posted, "Does
it work with the French

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:25.460
language?" Yeah, it does.

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:31.550
So basically the way that it
does this is it does it either

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:35.400
locally on your computer, or it
potentially it may go up to

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:40.690
the cloud and use Google
services to go in and do the

00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:41.380
translation.

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:50.850
So in fact, Jim let me try this,
and we'll see how good

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:52.810
its accent is.

00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:54.460
Let's pop this guy up here.

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:57.260
So here, I'll make it nice
and big for us, so

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:59.380
we can see it here.

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:03.380
So I've got, "Bon jour." My
French is awful, but--

[END AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:07.760
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, its
French accent is

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:11.070
about as bad as mine.

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:14.140
But you may be able to set it
into the French language.

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:15.970
In fact, let's have
a quick peek.

00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:19.900
If I bring the docs back
up here, I believe

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:22.340
that you can set.

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:27.830
Yeah, so here, TTS Voice
Language, you can set the

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:29.160
language that you
want it to use.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:35.990
So by default it's going to use
whichever the user is in.

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:44.220
But you could change it to
FRFR, or FRCA, or ZHFR,

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:47.190
whatever language you
particularly want it to use.

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:49.870
So it's really possible
to do a lot of

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:51.620
neat things with this.

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:55.300
You can go to the male, the
female voice, or anything like

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:59.660
that pretty quickly, pretty
easily without having to do

00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:01.670
too much crazy stuff.

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:04.500
So with that, I'm going to
wrap it up for this week.

00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:06.110
It's a little bit of a
short one this week.

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:08.450
But I say thank you
guys very much.
