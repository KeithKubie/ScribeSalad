I suppose that wasn't too difficult for you.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.170
PTAS clearly is the most powerful approximate ability,

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.170
because with PTAS you can get any constant factor approximation that you want.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.210
It is the smallest bubble in here.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.980
Then we have the constant factor algorithms. So these here.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.390
Then finally we have all of those problems for which there's

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.890
neither a constant-factor algorithm nor a PTAS up here.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.680
We already briefly mentioned that any Las Vegas algorithm can be turned into

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.980
a Monte Carlo algorithm, and for that reason the complexity class of all problems

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.600
for which there are Monte Carlo randomized algorithms, contains the complexity class

00:00:35.600 --> 99:59:59.000
of all problems for which there are Las Vegas algorithms.
