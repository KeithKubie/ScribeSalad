00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:09.730
So the entry point for soft robotics can be rather inexpensive because,

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.260
again, it's casting with off-the-shelf rubbers.

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:18.399
At the same time, other aspects of robotics are also approachable.

00:00:18.399 --> 00:00:23.289
The advent of the Arduino and all the things that made to

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.385
it is also making robotics become very, very egalitarian.

00:00:28.385 --> 00:00:30.640
So I think that soft robotics,

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.469
just like many other fields of robotics,

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:35.674
are becoming accessible to everyone.

00:00:35.674 --> 00:00:40.089
And it increases the amount to which you see inspiration in this world

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.865
because people have remarkable minds,

00:00:43.865 --> 00:00:47.969
not just the ones who have access to resources to use them.

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.479
So lowering the barrier of entry means that more people on the planet are

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:57.969
contributing to our technology society and it's fantastic to see.

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:02.439
I was at an academic robotics conference a few weeks

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:04.765
back and a very substantial portion

00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:07.750
of all the presentations had to do with soft robotics.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.519
And why is this?

00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:14.229
It's the fact that there are these insurmountable challenges in the field of

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:20.650
robots that people can't solve unless you start bringing in these compliant structures.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:26.760
And as other people are starting to realize the power of using this platform technology,

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.270
they're starting to implement it in all manner of systems.

00:01:30.269 --> 00:01:34.959
And I think that, as that understanding of the capabilities of soft robotics grows,

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:36.879
the implementation will grow,

00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:41.259
and you'll start seeing more and more of it in robotic systems to the point where

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.290
in a little while from now I kind

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.410
of feel like people won't think twice about seeing soft robotics.

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.359
It will just be robotics where that soft part was the coolest part.

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:55.420
I'm most excited about human-robotic interaction.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.099
So you take a look at collaborative robotics and a lot of great people have

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:05.393
taken the approach of taking systems that are made out of metal, that move fast,

00:02:05.393 --> 00:02:07.825
that have a lot of aspects of them that are

00:02:07.825 --> 00:02:11.545
fundamentally dangerous and through good software and good sensing,

00:02:11.544 --> 00:02:18.269
building systems that could lower the level of threat from the device.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.585
So there are a lot of interesting areas of soft robotics that are being explored so.

00:02:22.585 --> 00:02:24.185
As I said before soft robotics,

00:02:24.185 --> 00:02:27.340
think of it as not just the actuators but the sensors and

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.534
both are being researched in interesting application spaces.

00:02:31.534 --> 00:02:34.810
So if you think about the soft actuators side of it,

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.689
and going back to human-robot interactions,

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:43.079
there are people who are building a mechanical kind of heart-assist devices.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:50.990
So imagine an LVAD that cups under the heart and can compress the heart and pump blood.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.735
That's remarkable.

00:02:52.735 --> 00:02:55.205
You have the ability to circulate blood through the body

00:02:55.205 --> 00:02:57.760
for someone whose heart isn't working in a way where

00:02:57.759 --> 00:03:00.879
the mechanical parts never actually make blood contact which

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.597
is actually a very substantial improvement to the quality of someone's health.

00:03:04.597 --> 00:03:08.250
So that's a human-robotic mechanical interaction.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.169
Another example of that is you probably have seen a whole bunch

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:14.634
of robot, soft robotic hands.

00:03:14.634 --> 00:03:18.129
Where actuators are laid on the back of a hand and allow

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:22.560
you to either a, do rehab exercises.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.650
I myself once hurt my hand and I had to do rehab exercises.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.960
They're very boring. You kind of never actually do

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.974
them unless you're at your physical therapist's office

00:03:33.974 --> 00:03:35.669
and then they yell at you for not doing them.

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:41.259
So imagine a glove that you could bring home and it was simple to use.

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:43.044
It kind of wasn't an inconvenience so,

00:03:43.044 --> 00:03:46.659
you had a higher rate of patient compliance by using this system.

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:51.564
Which means a lower chance of kind of surgical revision of

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:56.794
whatever was done to mend you because you're complying with your treatment.

00:03:56.794 --> 00:03:58.689
You have the capacity to take

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:03.159
the soft mechanical structure and incorporate it with something that's more engaging than

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:06.340
physical therapy like a videogame that tracks

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.090
your progress and kind of rewards you for good behavior.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.175
So that's the sort of,

00:04:12.175 --> 00:04:15.995
doing that with a soft structure is a lot more plausible than a hard structure.

00:04:15.995 --> 00:04:17.290
And on the far end of it,

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.189
by using fundamental soft actuator technology you have healthier people.

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:23.279
So that's very interesting.

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:29.289
There's also the soft robotic sensor sign which you can see in wearables, right?

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:34.780
Right now wearables predominantly focus on sports applications,

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:37.604
and those are those are fun and great applications,

00:04:37.605 --> 00:04:40.360
but you know skinning people's bodies with sensors

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.694
could have a lot of meaning for society for example,

00:04:44.694 --> 00:04:48.040
the world's population is aging.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.160
You take a look at all across Europe and all across

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.075
North America and China and Japan, you name it.

00:04:55.074 --> 00:05:00.860
There's this inverted population where everyone is towards the side,

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.379
the elder side of the spectrum where they need care.

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:07.675
And part of that care is understanding what's going on in a person's body,

00:05:07.675 --> 00:05:11.360
and we don't have enough people to do all that work.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:18.045
So you know using soft compliant sensing structures to monitor someone's health,

00:05:18.045 --> 00:05:22.444
provide you real time warnings when something horrible has happened,

00:05:22.444 --> 00:05:24.365
I think that's a wonderful application.

00:05:24.365 --> 00:05:28.790
Actually also brings us back to mechanical soft robotic wearables where

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:33.500
something like the rehab glove I just described could

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.639
also be an exoskeleton that allows you to keep living

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:42.620
your life long after you may not have the full physical capability of doing so.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.030
So when I think of outside of the gripping solutions that we

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:52.339
deliver here of great places that soft robotics need to be,

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:55.000
I think of wearable robotics.
