&gt;&gt; John Haskell:
Welcome everyone

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.070
to the 18th Annual
National Book Festival.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.520
My name is John Haskell.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.440
I work at the Kluge Center
in the Library of Congress,

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.840
and we're proud to have
sponsors for this event,

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.690
including Wells Fargo, David
Rubenstein, The Washington Post

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.700
and the New York Times, and many
others that make it possible

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.940
to have events like this
that are free to the public,

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.510
thus officially the best free
event in Washington, D.C.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.060
[ Applause ]

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.700
So by way of preparation, before
we get into the conversation,

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.050
of course, you need to
silence your electronics,

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.630
cell phones, that sort of thing.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.440
So today we're talking
to Patricia O'Toole,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.970
who is the author
of "The Moralist,"

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.130
and she's also written
several other books, including,

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.310
in particular, "When
Trumpets Call, Teddy Roosevelt

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.700
After the White House,"
and "Five of Hearts,

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.490
An Intimate Portrayal
of Henry Adams

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.120
and his Friends, 1880 to 1918."

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.190
That was a finalist
for the Pulitzer Prize.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.490
Welcome, Patricia.

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:07.250
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole:
Thank you, John.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.550
&gt;&gt; John Haskell:
What motivated you

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.420
to write a biography
of Woodrow Wilson?

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.370
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole: He
was a big puzzle to me,

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.720
and in the beginning I
wanted to write about him

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.880
because the Roosevelt book
has a lot of World War I in it

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.640
and I got totally
fascinated by World War I,

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.160
but I thought I would write
about him as Commander in Chief

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.270
and then I learned
that he delegated most

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.660
of the responsibilities, so
there wasn't enough for a book,

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.900
there was an enough
for a paragraph,

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.130
Wilson as Commander in Chief.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.710
So then I started thinking
about his record in office.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.070
He was highly successful
for six years

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.190
and then he had a
terrible last two years.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.190
So it's a very kind of mixed
legacy, and I was just curious.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.570
I'm basically a student of
character, not a student

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.630
of presidents, necessarily,
and I just wanted

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.920
to know why that happened.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.810
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: In the last
ten years both Scott Berg

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.310
and John Milton Cooper have come

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.600
out with well-acclaimed
biographies of Wilson.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.190
How should we think about your
book in context with those?

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.860
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole: They're
really quite different.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.430
This is why people can
go on writing biography

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.760
after biography of
major figures.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.930
John Milton Cooper's is a --
he's a political historian

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.580
and a very, very good
biographer as well,

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.710
and he concentrates more on
the politics and he's trying

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.090
to cover a lot more
ground than I am.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.590
When I chose my focus
of "The Moralist,"

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.300
I was really concentrating on
the events in Wilson's life

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.950
that I could tie to my
notion of him as a person

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.390
who was deeply principled
and led from his principles.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.910
The Scott Berg book is
a little bit like mine

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.300
in that he has a focal point,

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.270
and that's Wilson's
Christianity,

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:03.630
and he really works that out
in great detail, and I thought

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.570
that Wilson's morality was
based on more than Christianity.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.780
I thought it was based as
much on American civic ideals.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.130
So I guess mine would be
expansion, not in the sense,

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.120
necessarily, of being better,
but just I wanted to add

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.300
that civic ideals
picture to the book.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.810
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Let's go
a little further into that

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.060
because that's -- you know, you
call the book "The Moralist"

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.730
and so talk to us a
little bit more about where

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.470
that moralistic streak
came from.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.330
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole:
He was a child and --

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.140
I mean, he was a child of
a Presbyterian minister.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.140
His mother was the child
of a Presbyterian minister.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.500
There are Presbyterian ministers
all over the family tree,

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.560
so the Christianity
is definitely a

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.630
formative influence.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.250
But once he started getting
interested in politics,

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.740
he really was interested
in, you know,

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.280
how do you make things
happen in politics.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.810
He was a great -- as a young
man, even as a teenager,

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.820
he hung a portrait of a British
prime minister in his bedroom.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.510
Any children here
today who do that?

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.060
[ Laughter ]

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.220
Kind of unusual boy.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.740
Then he went to Princeton
and he's studying government,

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.980
and kind of studying comparative
government and politics.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.050
And eventually he
decided that --

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.190
I mean, early on he decided
he wanted to be a statesman,

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.600
that's what he wanted to be, so
he sets off in that direction.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.540
And the great statesmen
that he admired

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.680
in the 19th century
were fantastic orators,

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.330
so that's what he perfected.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.650
He learned how to
project his voice.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.570
I don't know what I would do in
this room without a microphone,

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.720
but Wilson could speak to a
crowd outdoors of 10,000 people

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.130
and make his voice heard
without amplification.

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.970
So he went at that part of it,

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.820
training himself the
way an actor would.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.770
And he thought that
his job as a leader,

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.740
once he got to the White House,
was to think really hard,

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.040
get advice here and there,
but think really hard

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.950
about the right thing to do and
then talk people into doing it.

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.600
In other words, some
politicians would think, well,

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.520
I'm going to have to negotiate,
I'm going to have to compromise,

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.520
but Wilson just wanted to
find the right thing according

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.820
to his principles and also
what he thought was possible

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.730
in a given set of
circumstances and then talk you

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.290
into seeing it his way.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:36.930
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: So in the
end is being a moralist

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.770
or having this streak, you know,
a moralist streak, is that,

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.950
in the end, a strength
or a weakness?

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.140
I mean, clearly it's both,
but if you were to weigh it.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.440
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole: Yes.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.150
Well, what happened to him is
a cautionary tale, I think.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.280
For the first six years of his
presidency he has majorities

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:02.940
in both houses of Congress, so
much legislation gets passed

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.130
and everything is going his way.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.540
And he understood that the
majorities were key to this,

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.180
but he also, I think,
over-valued his oratory

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.640
and getting things happened
because he would go to Congress

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.220
when he wanted a big law, make
a very eloquent speech about it

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.100
and then poof, he
would get the great law

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.060
and he would think it
might not have happened

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.360
without his oratory.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.600
But he succeeds for six years.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.960
And then come the midterm
elections of 1918, so we're --

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.930
I mean, it's kind of
interesting to think about this

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:35.360
in terms of this year's.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.330
This will be the centennial of
that election, which was one

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.750
of the most consequential
elections ever

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.050
in American politics.

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.560
He loses both the
House and the Senate

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.160
and nothing goes
his way after that.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.340
But he's defiant in
the face of this,

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.180
of this new political reality.

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:57.760
He doesn't begin to do things
like compromise and negotiate,

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.580
that he didn't have
to do before.

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.510
Spoiler alert, things
do not go well.

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.080
[ Laughter ]

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.700
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: So I'm going
to switch gears for a second

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.340
and we'll get back
to talking about some

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.090
of the things he
did legislatively.

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:15.170
Many of us have read
largely older biographies,

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:19.670
but even some recent ones,
of Wilson that are based,

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:23.300
to a significant measure, I
think, on the views of what --

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.300
the man was called Colonel
House, Edward House, who was,

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.980
I guess, an informal visor to --

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.520
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole: Yes,
he was his confidant.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.820
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Yeah.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.120
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole:
His chief confidant.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.420
&gt;&gt; John Haskell:
Right, to Wilson.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.770
And yet you don't seem
to rely on Colonel House.

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:38.070
What's that about?

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:40.740
You know, what did you
figure out that was different

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.040
than other people had?

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.340
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole:
Well, I tried to --

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.640
you know, when you come along

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.800
after 600 biographies have
been written, you have to think

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.110
about what you can do
that's a little different.

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.630
And my point of view
of him as a moralist,

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:55.820
and that with strengths
and weaknesses

00:07:55.820 --> 00:08:01.900
because he doesn't shift
and his morality becomes

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:06.710
self-righteousness, rather
than straight moral principle.

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:11.560
Colonel House was quite
useful in domestic politics.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.830
He was a fixer, not a
corrupt kind of fixer,

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:18.140
but he was the one who could
finesse senator so-and-so

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:21.620
into changing his mind about
things, and he was very good,

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:24.030
he had a lot of contacts.

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:26.140
And Wilson didn't,
because before Wilson went

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:30.180
to the White House his sole
political office was being

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.020
governor of New Jersey
for two years,

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.800
so he didn't actually
know a lot of people

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.100
in the democratic party.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:39.260
House knew them all, so
he was useful in that way.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:44.880
And then Colonel House discovers
foreign affairs and it's

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:49.130
like champagne for him, you
know, and he becomes hooked

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:52.270
on this champagne and he
wants to try every variety

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:55.590
of champagne that there is and
drink more and more champagne,

00:08:55.590 --> 00:09:00.330
and he greatly overestimated
his abilities.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:04.920
The British referred to him
as the Empty House [laughter]

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:09.000
and he was -- Colonel House,
one of his main strategies

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.720
in dealing with people was
flattery and he thought he was

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.770
so good at it, but
he didn't understand

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:17.830
that people were flattering him,

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:20.290
so he took at face value
all the compliments

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:25.080
that people paid him, and
that's kind of fatal, you know.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:30.970
So he wasn't useful in foreign
affairs, and not only that,

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:33.500
he was quite duplicitous
with Wilson.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.910
He would tell prime
minister so-and-so

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:38.180
or the French president
this or that,

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:41.710
and then he would tell
Wilson something else

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:43.010
and we'll work it out.

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:45.620
So there's a lot of duplicity.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:46.920
Yeah.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.220
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: And
you actually depict him

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:49.520
as an unreliable source.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:50.950
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole: He is
an unreliable source, yes.

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:52.300
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: And so how did
you come to that conclusion?

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.490
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole: Well,
you can read his wheelings

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:59.870
and dealings with -- I mean,
for years biographers used --

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:03.130
House published, it's four
thick volumes that are excerpts

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:06.530
from his diaries, and
they're useful to a point,

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:10.650
but everything is about how
wonderful Colonel House is.

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:14.040
So then I thought, okay, he's
with the German ambassador,

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.830
let me go find out what the
German ambassador had to say

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:18.360
about his meeting
with Colonel House.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:22.440
So you get sort of different
impressions by, you know,

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:26.290
the more you can bring different
sources to bear on things.

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:29.450
So I came to think he was --

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:34.220
he certainly cared deeply for
Wilson and ultimately they broke

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:37.900
up at the Paris Peace
Conference when Wilson found

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.980
that House had been really
working around his back,

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.900
but there's a very sad
moment when Wilson dies

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.180
and House is waiting
for the White House --

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:47.480
or Wilson's out of
the White House.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.650
He's waiting for Mrs. Wilson or
somebody in the Wilson family

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:55.200
to invite him to the funeral and
there was just no invitation.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.420
So it's kind of sad.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.990
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: But you talked
about his legislative record

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:01.720
and he got a lot of
things passed, particularly

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.530
in the first few years, but
also in the first six years.

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:07.810
Give us a taste of those
legislative accomplishments.

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:09.720
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole: He
was elected on a package

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:13.070
of economic reform
called the New Freedom

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:16.660
and the big things
were to try to rout

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:18.930
out the plutocracy of the age.

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:20.480
I mean, thank goodness
we don't have to think

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.310
about that anymore,
right [laughter]?

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:24.700
Oligarchs, plutocrats,
it's all gone now.

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.940
It's wonderful.

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:32.450
So Wilson actually
works with Brandeis,

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:36.220
who had been thinking
along these lines,

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:39.470
and Wilson had a lot of ideas,
but they were sort of scattered

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:42.680
and to get all of this stuff
into a platform he works

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:47.100
with Brandeis and
they overhauled --

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:51.310
taxes used to be mostly
collected from revenues

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:53.610
on imports, tariffs,
in other words.

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:56.930
Thank God all that's
gone, too [laughter].

00:11:56.930 --> 00:12:00.860
So that ended up
costing consumers money.

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:02.250
We're beginning to see something

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:05.730
like that now with
this new round.

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:11.350
So one of the things was to get
rid of a lot of these tariffs,

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:13.990
which meant that American
manufacturers would have

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:15.770
to compete on a more
even footing

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:21.620
with foreign manufacturers and
prices might actually come down,

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:24.720
and it was a rough
adjustment, but it worked.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.900
And then there's the question
where do you get more revenue

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:29.710
if you're taking away tariff
revenue, and the answer was

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:34.140
to introduce an income
tax, and this happened.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:37.800
And if we want to make
America great again,

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.610
we should bring back
the first income tax

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:43.400
because half the people
didn't have to pay anything

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:49.000
and the highest earners, and
it was $500,000 or more a year

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.460
in 1916, your top rate
was seven percent.

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:56.910
So I think everybody
would be very happy

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:58.620
to go back to that income tax.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:02.840
So he gets rid of the tariffs,
introduces the income tax,

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:07.730
creates the Federal Reserve,
which basically eliminated a lot

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:09.030
of the kind of bank panics

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:12.800
that had been very common before
that, and put the United States

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:18.330
in kind of the same mold
of European Central Banks,

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:24.130
created a new antitrust law
that was easier for corporations

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:27.870
to understand, and then created
the Federal Trade Commission.

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:32.360
And I think the measure of
success of those things is

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:33.660
that they're still here.

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.110
A hundred years later
they're still here.

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:36.410
So it's very successful.

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:37.950
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: How
does he stack up?

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:39.590
Because normally
people say, well,

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:42.100
the people who had the
incredible legislative packages

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.340
were Roosevelt and the New
Deal and the Great Society

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:45.640
in the '60s with Johnson.

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:46.940
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole: Right.

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:48.240
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: How
does he stack up there?

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.510
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole: I think
he stacks up very well.

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:54.770
Maybe, I mean, certainly the New
Deal there were more measures,

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:56.370
but there was a depression.

00:13:56.370 --> 00:14:00.210
And Wilson got the big
things, the big pieces right,

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:02.510
so I think he stacks
up very well.

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:03.810
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: And
so what was the --

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:06.380
you know, you talk a lot about
the cost of doing business,

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:09.790
you know, it's never easy to
pass these things, you know,

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:11.240
compromises -- even
though he doesn't

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.990
like to compromise,
compromise --

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:14.290
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole: Right.

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:15.590
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: has to be made.

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:16.890
What was the major
cost of doing business?

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:18.190
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole:
Well, the major cost

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:22.160
of doing business is one
that still haunts us.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:26.870
He had to get southern votes
for these economic reforms

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:31.240
and Southerners, as a general
matter, did not like expansions

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.680
of federal power, and all

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.750
of these economic reforms
involved vast expansions

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:37.060
of federal power.

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.080
So they wanted a
sign from Wilson

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:43.490
that he wouldn't do anything
about segregation, and the sign

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:47.730
that -- to undo it in the South,
he wouldn't mess with state laws

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:50.460
about race and segregation.

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:56.270
So what they asked for, as
a sign of his going along

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:59.150
with their desires, was for him

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:02.740
to segregate the Civil
Service, which he did.

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:06.340
And the Civil Service
had been a happy place

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:09.850
for African Americans, actually,
in the decades before that.

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:12.800
They were not up there in
the supervisory rank so much,

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.480
but an African American living

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:19.950
in Washington could get
a Civil Service job,

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:23.400
and there were many, many,
many of them in the ranks.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:28.860
So the first incursions against
them under this new regime were

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:31.200
to separate the work spaces.

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.690
And then, you know,
there's no more integration

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:34.990
of the restrooms.

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:37.910
So you have black employees
having to go to the basement

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:41.990
to go to the restrooms,
or having to eat

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:43.290
at separate lunch tables.

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:45.230
So it was just insulting
kind of stuff.

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:47.000
And then it got rougher
than that.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.280
They required people applying
for jobs in the Civil Service

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:57.100
to submit a photograph, so
immediately it's easy to tell,

00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:01.770
in most cases, who's
black and who's not.

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:06.650
And this ruined a lot
of what had been a path

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:10.390
of upward mobility for
blacks for a long, long time.

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:13.220
And it didn't go away when --
Wilson gets blamed for this,

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:15.240
and he deserves the blame
because he's the guy

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:21.120
who started this, but it
went on through the New Deal.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.570
I mean, there were
many things like this,

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:27.170
where Roosevelt could get
votes for Social Security

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:30.390
from southerners if you
left out domestic workers

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:34.560
and farm workers because that's
where most blacks were working.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:37.770
So it's a very long,
terrible legacy.

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:41.560
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Now, somewhat
controversially you wrote

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:45.670
"Wilson knew segregation
was morally indefensible".

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:47.810
How did you arrive
at that conclusion?

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:49.110
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole: I arrived

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:50.410
at that conclusion --
it was interesting.

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:51.850
Wilson was not in good health.

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:55.130
Basically, his doctor, a
man named Cary Grayson,

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:57.780
was at the White House almost
all the time while Wilson

00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:59.080
was president.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:03.460
And Wilson, if he
had to do something

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:07.390
where his ideals were in
conflict with the action he had

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:11.030
to take, it often made
him physically ill.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:13.150
There are a number
of instances of this.

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:18.080
And there were two instances
where people wanted to talk

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:22.520
to him about segregation in the
Civil Service and undoing it,

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:25.190
and they ended up having
kind of knock-down,

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:30.910
drag-out conversations in
his office and Wilson was,

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:33.880
after the first one,
he was upset he went

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.050
to bed for like three days.

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:38.970
You know, he was just
profoundly upset by this.

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:41.540
And I think it's --
you know, when you have

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:43.490
to do something you
really don't want to do

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:48.950
and you feel it's morally wrong,
it can have a somatic effect,

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:52.020
and he responded to stress
in that same way, too.

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:53.320
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: And he
did it repeatedly, right?

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.620
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole: Yeah.

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:55.920
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: I mean,
this happened repeatedly?

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:57.220
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole: Yes, yes.

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:58.520
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Yeah.

00:17:58.520 --> 00:17:59.820
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole: It happened
a number of times, yeah.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:01.120
&gt;&gt; John Haskell:
So you mentioned --

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:02.420
I guess we both mentioned
that he --

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:03.720
I'll put it in your words --

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.020
showed no interest in mastering
the arts of friendship,

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:07.730
collaboration and disagreement.

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:09.030
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole:
I'm kind of --

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:10.330
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: To the point

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:11.630
of disdaining negotiation
on principle.

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:12.930
You talked about that.

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:14.410
I mean, that's odd
for a politician.

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:15.710
You know --

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:17.010
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole: It is odd.

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:18.590
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: How did
that cost him in terms

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:21.280
of the Peace Conference, or
in other ways specifically?

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.580
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole: Yes.

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:24.720
Well, this is back to this
thinking he can talk you

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.020
into submission --

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:27.320
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Yeah.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:28.620
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole: thing.

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:31.410
And at the Peace Conference
-- this is after World War I

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:34.160
and he goes to the
Paris Peace Conference,

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:38.310
he's just lost the
midterm elections of 1918.

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:41.520
He doesn't appoint any
leading republicans to be

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.180
on his Peace Commission.

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:44.480
He's just defiant.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.780
He goes off.

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:47.710
And then he has to
deal with these --

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:49.790
he thinks he's going
to have a lot of swat

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:52.980
because the United States
really did help to win the war,

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:57.840
first with lending the
allies millions and millions

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:02.500
of dollars, and second with our
Army was late getting there,

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:06.730
but there were, in the end, two
million soldiers on the ground

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:08.280
in France and that did --

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:12.490
it was instrumental in turning
the tide and ending the war.

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:16.540
So he thought he was going
in with a very strong hand,

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:22.580
and he just wasn't up to the
sort of close combat that you do

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:26.690
when four powerful heads
of state are negotiating.

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:28.950
And he wouldn't listen to
his Secretary of State.

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:33.950
He didn't like his Secretary of
State at all, Robert Lansing.

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:35.850
So you get this --

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:38.840
in the record, this
was all in the Library

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:40.960
of Congress actually,
part of my research,

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:44.070
I'm reading what's happening
in the Paris Peace Conference

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:46.710
and these conferences with
Wilson and his opposites

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:50.370
from France, England and Italy,

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:52.680
and then reading what
Lansing is writing.

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.550
You know, Lansing knows what's
going on, but he's not asked

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:59.250
to take part in very much of it,
and Lansing's making predictions

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:02.550
about what things are going
to go wrong in the future

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:07.850
because Wilson is not up to the
task of negotiating in the way

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:12.590
that these European diplomats
have had to do constantly.

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:14.540
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: And then he
has to bring this agreement

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:15.840
to Congress, to the Senate.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.950
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole: And he
brings it to Congress, yes.

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:20.980
He comes home in July of 1919.

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:24.430
Meanwhile, Henry Cabot Lodge,
who is his main adversary

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:27.960
in the Senate, and at this point
he's the Senate majority leader,

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:32.010
also the senior senator in
Congress, he's a pretty old man

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:33.310
at this point -- actually,

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:36.510
I was just thinking
he was my age, so --

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:42.040
[ Laughter ]

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:45.920
Lodge actually was giving --

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:48.850
Wilson was playing things pretty
close to the vest in Paris,

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:51.050
but every once in a while he
would have a press conference

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:53.930
and information would come
back to the United States.

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:58.790
So Lodge had an idea of what
was going on and he had fears

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:02.130
about over-committing the United
States in foreign affairs.

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:03.430
People paint him

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:05.090
as an isolationist
and he really wasn't.

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:07.650
He was kind of a -- he
wanted to be a great power

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:10.200
like the other great powers.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.840
But Lodge is making
these speeches which,

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:17.170
if Wilson had read them,
they were Lodge's game plan

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:20.960
for defeating the treaty that
he thought Wilson was going

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.440
to bring home from Paris,

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:25.950
but Wilson wasn't paying
any attention to Lodge.

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:27.880
So Wilson brings
the treaty home.

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.690
It goes to the Senate.

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:33.020
The Senate drags its feet
for a really long time.

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:37.580
And republicans are speaking
out against the treaty.

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:40.900
The covenant for the League of
Nations was part of the treaty

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:42.980
and that was a sticking
point for the Senate.

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:46.560
They just thought it
overcommitted the United States

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:49.810
and we would be sending troops
to every war that happened

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:52.390
in Europe from now
until kingdom come.

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:55.900
So Wilson goes out on a speaking
tour to the United States.

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:59.780
He's going to go over the
heads of the Senate and explain

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:02.920
to the American people what
the League of Nations was,

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.550
why the United States should
play a major part in it,

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:09.510
why it would be good for the
world, and then he expected

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:13.840
that people would write
their senators and, you know,

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.520
this would change
the minds of the --

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:17.770
after senators heard
from enough constituents,

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:20.210
they would change their
minds about things.

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:26.530
Well, Wilson was not in
good health at this moment

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:29.900
and his speeches -- it's
very sad to read them

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:33.160
because he's not -- you
know, he's clearly failing

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:36.330
at his superpower,
which was oratory.

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:38.500
And in the middle
of this tour --

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:40.790
well, about two-thirds of
the way through he collapsed

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:43.060
and the train had to
hurry back to Washington.

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:49.130
And then about a week after he
got home he had a major stroke

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:52.360
that paralyzed his
right side forever

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:58.020
and he couldn't lead the
fight for the treaty.

00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:03.440
And there was a little bit of
talk about should he resign,

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:06.290
but one of his reasons
for not resigning was

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:10.070
that the vice president, a man
named Thomas Riley Marshall,

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:11.370
who had been the governor

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:13.990
of Indiana before he was
vice president, he knew --

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:16.620
you know, the vice president's
president of the Senate, right.

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:20.850
So Marshall had already said he
would be willing to compromise

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:24.500
on the kinds of points where the
republicans wanted compromise,

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:28.320
and that was just an affirmant
to Wilson, so he hung in there.

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:32.650
And the treaty was defeated,
not once, but three times,

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:36.140
and the United States never
joined the League of Nations.

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:39.520
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: So you wrote
that Wilson, during World War I,

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.790
quote, "Repressed the Senate
more often and more harshly

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:45.350
than any other occupant of
the White House," and you went

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:48.190
on to write, "In a
novel construction,

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:51.510
the good American was no longer
the citizen who revered freedom,

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:54.260
but the one who refused to
tolerate those who disagreed

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:56.050
with their government."

00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:59.540
I mean, what should
we make of this?

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:01.610
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole: It's
quite a shameful episode,

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:04.140
and two of the major laws

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:07.630
about repressing descent
are still on the books.

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:11.510
So, you know, don't tell
anyone outside this room,

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:14.970
but I worry sometimes that
they're going to be invoked.

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:23.860
The reason, the ostensible
reason for doing it was

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:27.860
that one-third of the
population was either --

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:32.080
they were immigrants or they
were children of immigrants,

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:35.110
and the thought was that
you have this world war

00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:37.990
and you have all these people
who are in the United States

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:42.060
who have cousins and uncles
fighting in this world war

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:45.020
on one side or another,
so he feared that a sort

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:47.660
of miniature version of
the world war could happen

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:49.900
in the United States
just because you have

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:53.300
such a large percentage of
the population disagreeing

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:55.660
about what was happening
in the war.

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:59.000
So once the United
States is in the war,

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.900
he doesn't want anything
like that to happen.

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:05.300
He thought it would compromise
our chances of winning.

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:08.470
So that was the ostensible
reason for this, yes.

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:11.510
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: So he once
said before he became president,

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:14.460
this is Wilson, quote, "It
would be an irony of fate

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:17.010
if my administration
had to deal chiefly

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:19.470
with foreign affairs,"
end quote.

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:21.800
Did, in the end, the
foreign affairs side

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:25.720
of his presidency have more
impact than the domestic?

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.010
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole: Well, the
domestic triumphs still stand

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:31.020
and his notion of
what should happen

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:35.550
in the world was truly
revolutionary, and we still --

00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:40.050
I admire it very much and
I think that some people

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:42.190
in the world are
still trying to figure

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:43.730
out how to make it happen.

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:45.770
It's not that you have
a world government,

00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:49.140
but you have a world
organization that can --

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:52.570
his insight was that
global problems require

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:54.350
global solutions.

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:58.210
That still makes sense to
me a hundred years later.

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:02.970
And his impact has diminished.

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:07.480
And people argue about how
important it is and that --

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:10.140
what happened after --

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:16.030
or actually, during World War II
FDR was, in Wilson's presidency,

00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:19.860
FDR was the assistant
secretary of the Navy

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:22.760
for the whole eight years,
and FDR was also a young man

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.360
who wanted to be
president someday,

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:27.410
so he's watching the
president very, very closely

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:29.740
and thinking about,
oh, this works,

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:31.040
that doesn't work so well.

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:33.360
He's learning a lot
from this experience.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:38.870
So early in 1942 FDR
assembled some advisors

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:42.040
and he said I think we're
going to need something

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:43.890
like the League of Nations,
but this time we have

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:46.900
to make it stick and we have to
figure out how to make it work.

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:50.320
So these people studied what
had worked, what had not worked

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:51.620
in the League of Nations.

00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:55.380
And also, Roosevelt, once he
decided he wanted to do this,

00:26:55.380 --> 00:27:00.420
he began cultivating the other
side, people who were likely

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:03.300
to be opposed to more
international involvement,

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:05.650
isolationist kind of people,

00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:08.800
and that was something
Wilson never did.

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:11.790
So FDR is going about it

00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:14.510
in a politically, I
think, smarter way.

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:17.360
And FDR and his advisors
also figured out --

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:21.970
or they concluded that the
League of Nations had been asked

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:24.830
to do too many things
and it would be better

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:26.670
if you had the League of Nations

00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:30.230
and then you had other
associations, either regional

00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:33.160
or global, to tackle big things.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:37.280
So out of this, in the post-war,
early post-World War II era,

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:40.010
we get things like that the
International Monetary Fund

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:42.570
and the World Bank
and NATO and --

00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:46.200
so that everything doesn't
come out of the U.N.

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:50.200
And that model held
until -- pretty well.

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:52.150
I mean, it went through
various changes,

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:57.020
various presidents thought
of ways to pull back.

00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:02.600
It's thought that President
George H.W. Bush was the last

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.820
liberal internationalist,
which is what followers

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:06.920
of Wilson had come to be called.

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:10.570
He's also the last president
who fought in World War II.

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:14.320
And then after that
comes Bill Clinton

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.160
and there's a pulling back.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:18.720
It's like, well, we still
are internationalists,

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:21.840
but we're going to pick and
choose what we're going to do.

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:26.000
And then comes George Bush with
the doctrine of pre-emptive war

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.520
and not so much respect for
the kind of nation building

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:35.090
that a good, old-fashioned
liberal internationalist would

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:38.240
be in favor of.

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:41.580
Probably the biggest example
of that, as a good model,

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:43.300
would be the Marshall
Plan, you know,

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:46.520
that if you make
a big investment,

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.550
you're likely to
get a big payback.

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:53.840
And now we're at a moment
where, you know, it's a moment

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:58.250
of crisis for the old
liberal international order,

00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:01.900
and this idea of going
it alone in the world,

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:06.480
I just don't see how that -- I
mean, Wilson understood in 1918

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:11.900
that that was not a feasible
proposition anymore just

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:14.040
because of airplanes
and airplanes being able

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:16.620
to go everywhere to bomb.

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:19.120
And Wilson's idea was
you fold the whole world

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:21.100
into one alliance and
then you don't have

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:24.040
to have these competing
alliances and spend a lot

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:26.490
of money on arms, and so on,

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:29.930
and you could probably
prevent a lot of wars that way.

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:34.460
So I don't know if we're
at the beginning of new era

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:35.830
or the end of the old era.

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:38.930
I mean, I think it will take
us some time to sort that out.

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:43.250
But I think Wilson's idea,
his basic idea that, you know,

00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:46.280
in this really interconnected
world

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:49.610
and if you've got global
challenges like climate change,

00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:55.450
it's probably a good idea
to have global solutions.

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:58.590
So that's where we are
right now, is not knowing

00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:02.140
if the old order will come back
or we're into a whole new order

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:03.440
for the United States.

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:06.940
We're still up in the air about
the role of the United States

00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:08.930
on the world stage, I think.

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:10.230
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Before
we get to some questions,

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:13.400
we'll have some questions
in a minute or two,

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:17.490
a lot of American
historical figures, you know,

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:20.520
have prominent places,
schools, colleges, you know,

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:23.480
high schools, universities,
programs named after them,

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.780
and monuments, et cetera,
and a lot of them --

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:28.660
and Wilson's among those
who are controversial now

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:31.090
because of positions on
race and other things.

00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:34.350
How do you think about that?

00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:36.890
How do you think we should
think about Woodrow Wilson

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:42.130
in terms of, I guess, some might
say imposing the current ways

00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:43.430
of thinking --

00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:44.730
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole:
The present values

00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:46.030
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Yeah.

00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:47.330
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole: Yeah.

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:48.630
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: the
present values on the past.

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:49.930
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole: Yes.

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:51.230
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: How do
you think about that?

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:52.530
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole: The way
I think about it is not a way

00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:53.830
that everybody thinks about it,

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:55.510
but I think when you
erase the history,

00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:57.440
then a bad thing can happen.

00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:00.610
You know, it just disappeared as
if there never was this history.

00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:04.640
So I'm more in favor of
explaining than deleting,

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:06.210
but I've also been moved by --

00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:09.730
you know, that speech that
the mayor of New Orleans made

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:13.670
about he just -- you know,
many people had talked to him

00:31:13.670 --> 00:31:17.100
about how painful it is to walk
past the statue of Robert --

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:19.060
you know, African
Americans, how painful it is

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:21.690
to walk past the
statue of Robert E. Lee

00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:25.650
and the celebrations
of the Confederacy.

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:29.190
This is not -- I mean,
we've seen, it's not --

00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:31.710
you know, there's a whole
Wilson aspect of this as well

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:33.710
at Princeton and they've
made some changes,

00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:38.940
but they decided -- there's a
Woodrow Wilson School of Public

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:42.230
and International Affairs
there, and that name still stays

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:45.280
but they've made
some other changes.

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:51.510
In New York City I did a
project with the American Museum

00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:54.080
of Natural History once.

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:56.670
They were revising their
Theodore Roosevelt Hall,

00:31:56.670 --> 00:32:00.080
or remodeling it,
and there's a statue,

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:03.560
maybe some of you have seen it,
outside on Central Park West

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:05.640
of Theodore Roosevelt on a horse

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:08.380
and there's a Native American
walking on one side of him,

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:11.170
and not even like an
African American figure,

00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:13.400
but like an African
figure, for some reason,

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:18.340
walking on the other side,
and he's, you know --

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:21.930
Roosevelt, in his younger
years thought that --

00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:25.480
he said about settling the
West, whether by treaty

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:28.990
or annihilation we're
going to settle the West.

00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:33.060
I mean, that is really harsher
than anything Wilson ever said.

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:38.590
So there are a lot of people who
would like that statue to come

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:42.360
down and it can't come down.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:46.070
It's landmarked in New York
state, so that's the argument

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:48.850
so far, that you can't take
down a landmarked thing.

00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:52.450
I think that could
change sometime.

00:32:52.450 --> 00:32:59.830
And what the museum has decided
to do is explain, not delete,

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:02.370
and I think that's
a good approach.

00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:05.020
Maybe it isn't the right
approach for everything,

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:07.010
but I think it's an
interesting way to think

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:08.640
about solving this problem.

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:09.940
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Well,
thank you very much.

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:11.240
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole: Thank you.

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.540
&gt;&gt; John Haskell:
Very interesting.

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:13.840
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole: Thank you.

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:15.140
[ Applause ]

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:18.040
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: So those of
you who have questions can queue

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:19.360
up behind the microphone.

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:21.820
Sir.

00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:26.310
&gt;&gt; Hi. Why did Woodrow Wilson
run for president in 1912;

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:27.610
what was the motivation?

00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:30.720
And then also, I know
after his presidency

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:33.580
that you said it was
a downward trajectory

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:37.240
after the '18 election, and then
in 1920 the republicans romped

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:40.150
to victory with Harding
and Coolidge.

00:33:40.150 --> 00:33:44.740
What did he think about like
the entire party just collapsing

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:46.880
in his wake after
he left office?

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:48.180
&gt;&gt; John Haskell:
That's a great question.

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:49.540
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole: Yeah,
that is a great question.

00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:53.810
When he ran in 1912, he
was chosen by the democrats

00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:55.720
because he was a fresh face.

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:57.080
He didn't have any baggage.

00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:02.770
He had only been in politics
for two years and he was a good,

00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:04.870
solid economic progressive.

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:07.850
You know, we know now that he
wasn't progressive on race,

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:10.050
he wasn't progressive on
women's issues either.

00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:12.530
He didn't support a
constitutional amendment

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:15.870
for suffrage until
1918, and he did it then

00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:18.120
because he knew it was going
to happen and he wanted to be

00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:20.590
on the right side of history.

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:25.700
So he ran because he was
asked to run and he --

00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:28.490
it's a four-way race in 1912.

00:34:28.490 --> 00:34:31.490
He's running against
Taft, the incumbent,

00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:35.270
Theodore Roosevelt charges
in for a third term,

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:39.940
creates a new party, and
then Eugene Debs ran also.

00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:43.100
So Wilson got 42
percent of the vote

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:48.940
and that was enough
to get him elected.

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:54.370
And after the election of 1918,

00:34:54.370 --> 00:34:57.210
when the democratic
party collapsed, he --

00:34:57.210 --> 00:35:00.540
I'm interested in your question
because he mostly didn't --

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:02.620
he wasn't so focused on that.

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:08.770
He was focused more on like how
idiotic the republicans were,

00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:13.140
how they refused to face
the realities of the world

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:16.040
that had been changed
by World War I.

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:18.150
So he didn't really
blame himself for that.

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:21.630
And after he left the White
House the only regret he ever

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:25.750
expressed about his failed fight
for the Treaty of Versailles

00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:29.030
and the League of Nations was
that his timing was wrong.

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:33.660
He said I think I was ahead of
the American people on this one.

00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:35.640
And there he is, he's a
very sick man, you know,

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:39.690
he's had this stroke, he's still
paralyzed, but he's imagining,

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:43.770
both in 1920 and then
in 1922, that he's going

00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:46.140
to run for president again.

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:48.630
You know, he's clearly
not thinking straight.

00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:52.260
But one of the last things
-- one of the two last --

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:56.390
two of the last things
that he wrote were a sketch

00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:58.950
of his platform for 1924.

00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:01.940
I mean, this is a man who
is really, really ill.

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:08.600
And a draft of his
acceptance speech

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:12.920
after he got the democratic
nomination in 1924.

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:15.260
He died early in 1924.

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:18.630
He died in February 3rd, 1924.

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:23.990
So people ask me how I
feel about Woodrow Wilson

00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:27.730
as a person, you know, what it
was like to write about him,

00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:31.340
because he's not a cozy guy, you
know, you wouldn't like ask him

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:33.820
out for a beer [laughter].

00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:37.960
And I feel like he was a
really good man who wanted

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:39.260
to do the right thing,

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:42.100
but he just didn't
acquire all the skills

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:45.230
that a politician needs at
the level of the presidency

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:47.640
to do better than he did.

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:50.290
But I still admire his
economic achievements

00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:53.510
and I still admire his
ambition for the world to figure

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:57.430
out a way for global
cooperation.

00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:58.730
Yes, another question?

00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:00.030
&gt;&gt; John Haskell:
We'll go on this side.

00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:01.330
Yeah.

00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:02.630
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole: Oh, okay.

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:03.930
&gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you
for the presentation.

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:05.230
I came in here by chance,

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:06.820
and it's more serendipity
now, so I appreciate that.

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:10.550
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole: Oh, it's
your lucky day, isn't it?

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:11.850
&gt;&gt; Yes, it is.

00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:13.150
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole: Yeah.

00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:14.450
Hi.

00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:15.750
&gt;&gt; So how did Wilson
square his moralism

00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:17.830
with the behavior of the allies?

00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:21.240
So thinking about something
like the Balfour Declaration

00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:23.090
or the Sykes-Picot Agreement,

00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:26.480
or other colonialist
activities that --

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:27.780
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole: Yes.

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:29.080
Yeah.

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:30.380
&gt;&gt; came out of the
Paris negotiations?

00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:31.680
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole: Yes.

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:32.980
That's --

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:34.280
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Thank you.

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:35.950
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole: That's
an excellent question.

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:39.070
He thought that his
big achievement

00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:44.090
in that regard was they --
you know, the former colonies

00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:50.120
of the other side, the Germans,
were taken away from them

00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:55.390
and rather than just
declare these things,

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:59.340
rather than divide them up
among the other victors,

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:03.330
he convinced the allies
at the Peace Conference

00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:07.820
that they should be mandates
of these powers and the powers,

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:10.140
you know, like France
had some --

00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:13.530
well, I don't want
to get in the weeds,

00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:16.740
but he saw that as an
improvement on imperialism,

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:19.190
and it was kind of, in
a way, the beginning

00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:21.720
of the end of colonialism.

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:23.030
So that was his contribution.

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:27.340
And he didn't like
these things at all.

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:31.390
But one of the problems

00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:36.040
at the Peace Conference
is the principal powers

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.250
that were negotiating this --
the Germans were not invited

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:40.600
to the Peace Conference.

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:43.320
And they had decided among
themselves, the victors,

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:46.130
that they had to, when
they wrote an article

00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:49.280
into the treaty, it would be
after all of them agreed on it.

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.090
They had to have unanimity,
because they thought

00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:53.610
if they didn't, that
would be open to challenge

00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:55.890
by the defeated powers.

00:38:55.890 --> 00:38:58.930
So Wilson often argued
very intelligently

00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:02.840
and very forcefully for his
point of view, but if the vote

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:05.850
in the end is three-to-one and
you have this unanimity thing,

00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:07.670
he has to go along
with the other side.

00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:11.530
So he did win some
concessions but not enough.

00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:16.460
So that's, I think, a possibly
good way to look at Wilson

00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:19.520
and the colonialism
after World War I.

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:20.820
Yeah. Yes.

00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:22.120
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: The
gentleman over here.

00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:23.650
&gt;&gt; So you mentioned how
critical the election

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:26.400
of November 1918 was.

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:29.270
I'm just curious about
what was Wilson up to,

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:39.940
what his priorities were in the
month, six weeks before that,

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:45.530
October 1918, when he was
trying to win that election

00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:47.520
and negotiate an
armistice and think

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:48.820
about the future all at once.

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:50.120
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole: Yes.

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:53.220
He was certainly more
occupied with thoughts of peace

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:56.250
than anything else, and
he made a fatal blunder

00:39:56.250 --> 00:39:58.950
in the weeks leading
up to the election.

00:39:58.950 --> 00:40:02.570
He sent an appeal to the
country saying he needed them

00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:06.700
to vote democratic
because he was going to go

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:11.450
to the Peace Conference and he
had to have the solid backing

00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:13.130
of the American people.

00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:16.570
And the republicans
were insulted,

00:40:16.570 --> 00:40:21.840
and I think justifiably so,
because the republicans,

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:25.930
when it came to votes
on lending money

00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:32.260
to the allies before we were
in the war and then going --

00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:38.350
you know, building up the Navy
and Army in case we had to be

00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:41.780
in the war, and more
spending itself,

00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:45.410
the republicans were there as
a solid block behind Wilson

00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:48.490
and it was people from
the middle of the country,

00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:50.860
not all of them, or
southerners, who didn't --

00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:52.720
you know, they just thought we
don't have any business going

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.020
beyond the United States.

00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:55.320
So I actually, in my
book, use the word dumbest

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:56.620
to describe this move of his

00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:57.920
and a couple editors
asked me do you really --

00:40:57.920 --> 00:40:59.220
you know, that's not your
usual tone with things,

00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:00.520
do you really want to use
that word, and I thought

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:01.820
about it hard and long
and I decided I did.

00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:03.120
I mean, it was really
dumb [laughter].

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:04.420
So --

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:07.510
and his wife begged him
not to send this out.

00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:09.950
I think Colonel House begged
him, too, not to send it out,

00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:15.810
but he did, and the
rest was very sad.

00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:17.170
Yeah. Yes.

00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:18.990
&gt;&gt; Well, I planned to be here

00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:21.090
because teaching
the Middle East,

00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:23.320
talking about Woodrow
Wilson was very important.

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:26.390
So to follow up on my
colleague's question,

00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:31.060
the King-Crane Commission, would
you like to comment on that,

00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:35.250
that he sent to the Middle
East to ask -- this was 1919.

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:40.510
Was that kind of part of, again,
this moralist, principled man

00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:43.820
who wanted to ask the people
who lived in that part

00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:45.900
of the world what they wanted?

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:47.490
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole:
You know, he was so busy

00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:50.930
at the Paris Peace Conference
that he took along this group

00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:52.230
of people called "The Inquiry".

00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:53.530
Have you read about
them and their work?

00:41:53.530 --> 00:41:54.830
[ Inaudible comment ]

00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:56.130
It was a very good book --

00:41:56.130 --> 00:41:57.430
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:58.730
&gt;&gt; by a man named
Lawrence Gelfand

00:41:58.730 --> 00:42:00.030
that details what they're doing.

00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:02.320
So a lot of smart people who
were expert in different parts

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:04.320
of the world, cartographers,
geographers,

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:07.680
economists, and so on.

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:08.980
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:10.280
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole:
And the answer

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:11.580
to your question is
probably in there,

00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:13.600
but he took their advice
on a lot of things.

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:19.160
So if this idea had come to
him, he would have said, well,

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:21.480
what do the men at The
Inquiry think about this,

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:23.550
and would have followed
their advice.

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:25.370
So it's something
that really didn't get

00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:26.790
on my radar very much.

00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:28.290
I'm sorry I can't be more help.

00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:29.590
&gt;&gt; No. That's fine.

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:30.890
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole: Yeah.

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:32.190
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:33.490
Thank you.

00:42:33.490 --> 00:42:34.790
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Ma'am.

00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:36.090
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole: Yes.

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:37.390
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:38.690
I was wondering who were his
mentors, as maybe starting

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:39.990
in college, in that area.

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:41.290
Who did he look up to?

00:42:41.290 --> 00:42:43.510
And then, it's maybe
a different question,

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:46.420
but who did he listen to?

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:47.720
That's what --

00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:49.020
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole: Wow.

00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:50.870
Yeah. Yes.

00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:53.470
His mentors, the statesmen

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:57.820
who inspired him were
the great orators.

00:42:57.820 --> 00:43:04.530
So, you know, Lincoln, Calhoun,
Webster, in the United States.

00:43:04.530 --> 00:43:10.220
And then in England it
was Sir William Gladstone

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:14.340
and a guy named Cobb,
and they were all people

00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:16.910
who were really great
speakers who managed to --

00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:18.990
you know, managed
to sway parliament

00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:20.520
to do something or other.

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:23.550
So those were his models.

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:28.350
And then the question of who
he listened to, he got more

00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:30.350
and more isolated
as he was president.

00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:34.080
He was a better listener
early on.

00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:38.070
His treasury secretary,
William Gibbs McAdoo,

00:43:38.070 --> 00:43:42.400
became his son-in-law
and Wilson did --

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:46.240
because he's in the family,
so he would listen to McAdoo,

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:49.100
but he really didn't
like him very much.

00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:51.150
And he listened to Colonel House

00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:54.380
up to 1918, and that's
mainly it.

00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:55.770
Yes. Thank you.

00:43:55.770 --> 00:43:57.410
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Well thank
you very much, Patricia.

00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:58.710
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole:
Thank you, John.

00:43:58.710 --> 00:44:00.010
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: This
has been fascinating.

00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:01.310
&gt;&gt; Patricia O'Toole:
Thank you very much.

00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:02.610
It was a great interview.

00:44:02.610 --> 00:44:03.910
&gt;&gt; John Haskell:
Thanks for joining us.
