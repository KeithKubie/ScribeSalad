00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.430
<v 0>Our story today starts a couple of years back on February 26 2014 Washington DC</v>

10
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:45.470
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

11
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.390
<v 1>you know we got up very early that morning. This is February, I believe so.</v>

12
00:00:50.391 --> 00:00:53.550
It was pretty cold and I'll tell you,

13
00:00:53.551 --> 00:00:57.700
we were sitting there and I'm sort of the cavernous, you know,

14
00:00:57.701 --> 00:01:01.950
empty a metro station rehearsing Chi says he and his friend Ryan Clayton went

15
00:01:01.951 --> 00:01:05.370
through what they were about to do over and over and over.

16
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.160
It was very helpful to just sort of go through it and go through and go through

17
00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:08.994
it.

18
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:11.443
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

19
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.050
<v 1>Jane comes, they hop on the train ticket, a couple of stops,</v>

20
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.600
get out, walk a couple blocks, cross a few streets,

21
00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.080
and then walk up the marble steps to the Supreme Court.

22
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.310
And then we have to wait in line, get through security.

23
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.380
Um, and you're trying, you know,

24
00:01:29.381 --> 00:01:31.600
you're trying to just be cool once they're inside,

25
00:01:31.601 --> 00:01:33.850
they pretend not to know each other. And then, uh, you know,

26
00:01:33.851 --> 00:01:35.050
you get brought into the chamber.

27
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.920
My first time ever being inside, they take their seats in the spectator section,

28
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.990
look around and it's such a grand kind of intimidating space.

29
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.630
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

30
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.680
<v 1>there are these red velvet curtains at the back and if you look up marble</v>

31
00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.850
carvings on the, uh, the walls and the ceiling

32
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.330
and on the north and south walls,

33
00:02:04.331 --> 00:02:07.660
there are these huge portraits of great lawmakers through history.

34
00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.560
Moses Hammurabi, John Marshall, Muhammad.

35
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.120
So I was just taking all of that in feeling, feeling the butterflies,

36
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.610
and I had a sense that, uh, it was very much doable.

37
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.590
And then it's just waiting. Eventually the court Marshall comes out,

38
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.170
says a few words about how it works when you're in there.

39
00:02:29.171 --> 00:02:34.150
And not to speak and so on. And then finally the nine justices enter the room,

40
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.610
almost like priests on a cloud,

41
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.780
their robes sort of whispering around them at that point tried to meditate son,

42
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.940
just be smart and stay cool.

43
00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.380
And then chief justice John Roberts speaks your argument first this morning in

44
00:02:47.381 --> 00:02:52.381
case 12 1184 octane fitness versus icon health and fitness incorporated.

45
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.600
He was a patent case case itself.

46
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.620
Isn't that important MR chief justice and may it please the court because after

47
00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:00.760
the lawyers make their arguments,

48
00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:03.950
there are no further questions your honor or is your to affirm the cases

49
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.310
submitted then thank you counsel. I saw Ryan make his motion and I was just

50
00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.590
that point just sort of like the practice in the sense of readiness and you know

51
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.930
a little bit of sort of a rock and roll. Han Solo Spirit, you know,

52
00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:19.810
to just say like it's, it's game time. We've just got to do this thing.

53
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.490
And I stood and said,

54
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.400
<v 3>I arrived on behalf of the vast majority of the American people who believe that</v>

55
00:03:26.401 --> 00:03:27.390
money is not me

56
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.140
<v 1>and that our democracy should not be for sale,</v>

57
00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.960
<v 3>would not be for sale, the highest bidder [inaudible]</v>

58
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.340
<v 1>I saw the security coming towards me from the left and like people getting up</v>

59
00:03:38.341 --> 00:03:43.170
and then sort of crashing through the chairs, attacking me from behind

60
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.460
the bear, hug me and then pulled me back through those people.

61
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.010
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

62
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.810
<v 0>okay. Newkirk was arrested. He spent the night in jail,</v>

63
00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.460
later pled guilty to three misdemeanor charges, but no one had noticed Ryan.

64
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.380
No one had noticed that they were together,

65
00:04:02.381 --> 00:04:05.320
that Ryan had secretly videotaped the entire episode.

66
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.510
So when the day's session was over and Ryan went home and posted the video onto

67
00:04:10.511 --> 00:04:15.110
youtube, the story just went crazy. Outburst,

68
00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:20.140
a protest protestor interrupting the cord on Wednesday protest or objecting to

69
00:04:20.421 --> 00:04:25.421
the role of money in politics because almost no outsider had ever gotten a

70
00:04:25.851 --> 00:04:28.640
camera into the quarter. This isn't supposed to happen.

71
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.580
It's not supposed to happen. Tony, obviously a cameras are bad from the courts.

72
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.400
Cameras have never been allowed inside the nation's highest court. In second,

73
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.430
they'll go the gall of someone to walk into that esteemed chamber and do that to

74
00:04:43.191 --> 00:04:46.130
those esteemed justices. And by the way,

75
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.820
<v 1>not just once. You'll get an argument first this morning in case Boutine footie.</v>

76
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.870
You know the Supreme Court action that we did in February,

77
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.410
2014 was the first but not the last. Thank you, MR chief justice.

78
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.410
Here's the fifth anniversary of citizens United and there were seven people who

79
00:05:01.411 --> 00:05:02.244
did [inaudible]

80
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.670
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

81
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:12.530
<v 1>This is from January 21st, 2015 security again,</v>

82
00:05:12.531 --> 00:05:14.920
rounds up. The protesters are second order of business.

83
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.440
<v 2>Do you have any [inaudible]</v>

84
00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.890
<v 1>chief justice Roberts tries to laugh it off. Oh, please.</v>

85
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:24.741
In the same recording,

86
00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:28.070
you can sort of hear justice Ginsburg trying to figure out like how many,

87
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.070
how many protesters are in the room. We have another one,

88
00:05:31.071 --> 00:05:32.430
a couple over there too.

89
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.160
<v 2>He's [inaudible].</v>

90
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.700
<v 1>Over the next year or so, we did more actions. Next one,</v>

91
00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.973
April 1st, 2050

92
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.903
<v 2>dean,</v>

93
00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.370
see if there's another

94
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.350
<v 1>justices, Scalia and Thomas murmuring to each other.</v>

95
00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.690
Didn't think the bankruptcy cases would attract such attention. Oh, please.

96
00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.120
<v 4>You can hear Justice Thomas say, I think that's the same dude as the last</v>

97
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.560
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

98
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.620
<v 4>kind of hard to hear over the yelling.</v>

99
00:06:13.621 --> 00:06:17.010
But you can sorta hear Justice Scalia lean over to Thomas and say,

100
00:06:17.011 --> 00:06:18.800
we should throw these people in jail. Basically.

101
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.750
<v 5>Anyone else interested in talking?</v>

102
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.200
We'll be admonished that it's within the authority of this court to punish such

103
00:06:24.201 --> 00:06:26.030
disturbances by criminal contempt.

104
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.710
<v 6>We moved. Sorry.</v>

105
00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.853
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

106
00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:37.853
<v 6>[inaudible] do it.</v>

107
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.450
<v 4>So here's why we started the story this way over and over again.</v>

108
00:06:41.451 --> 00:06:43.520
The protestors call out one case.

109
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.250
It's one of the most controversial cases in American history.

110
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:52.040
It was decided on January 21st, 2010 and two a good chunk of America.

111
00:06:52.041 --> 00:06:55.900
That was the day that corporations to control of American [inaudible]

112
00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:56.753
<v 7>democracy.</v>

113
00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.253
[inaudible]

114
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.870
<v 5>it is the dark ages. It is our dreads. Scott</v>

115
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:09.200
<v 7>[inaudible],</v>

116
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.100
<v 5>I would suggest a revolution, but a revolution against the corporations,</v>

117
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.920
the corporations that make all the guns and the bullets

118
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:17.800
<v 4>get rid of citizens. Yeah,</v>

119
00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:21.280
<v 7>no, I did. And it's partnership affects on our own.</v>

120
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.550
<v 5>That's one of the worst supreme court decisions.</v>

121
00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:29.660
<v 8>It's misguided naive on courageous decision of the United States Supreme Court,</v>

122
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.580
I think in the 21st century.

123
00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.330
<v 4>So this season more perfect.</v>

124
00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:37.500
We're rethinking a lot of the most hated Supreme Court decisions.

125
00:07:37.501 --> 00:07:39.710
And this one citizens United is definitely right.

126
00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:41.720
<v 7>She overturned</v>

127
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.990
<v 4>it is widely loathed across the political spectrum.</v>

128
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:52.330
We got curious why, why is it hated so much?

129
00:07:52.331 --> 00:07:56.560
What exactly is this case? Why was it decided the way it was decided?

130
00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:01.620
And it turns out that that last question gives you a unique window into not just

131
00:08:02.081 --> 00:08:04.660
how the supreme court works, but inside the mind

132
00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.760
of arguably the most powerful man in America.

133
00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.700
<v 9>The honorable, the chief justice,</v>

134
00:08:11.701 --> 00:08:15.720
and the associate justices of the Supreme Court of the United States.

135
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:19.170
Oh, Yay. Oh Yay.

136
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.720
<v 1>Well yeah, having business before the honorable,</v>

137
00:08:22.721 --> 00:08:25.940
the Supreme Court of the United States, red monies to draw in Aaron

138
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:29.503
[inaudible], who's now

139
00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.900
God's Fabian faith in this honorable card

140
00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:51.413
<v 6>[inaudible].</v>

141
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.100
<v 4>Okay, so the</v>

142
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.700
<v 0>story of citizens United begins with a letter</v>

143
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:02.910
<v 10>landmark film from the core doors. There's power ChiroThin,</v>

144
00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:06.800
small town America.

145
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:13.730
Impressive grab ass. And I have more.

146
00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:17.510
Some people call you the elite. I call you.

147
00:09:17.511 --> 00:09:20.350
My name is summer 2004 commercials for it.

148
00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:22.270
<v 0>Fahrenheit nine 11 are all over the place.</v>

149
00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:25.030
<v 10>It's the true story that will make you a candidate.</v>

150
00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.010
<v 0>You've seen the documentary, you know,</v>

151
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:31.670
it's very critical of then president George W.

152
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:35.750
Bush for leading America into war based on false intelligence and the

153
00:09:35.751 --> 00:09:36.330
commercials.

154
00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:37.200
<v 11>When you looked at them,</v>

155
00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:42.120
they came across as highly political and highly effective, um,

156
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:43.110
ads.

157
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:45.270
<v 0>This is Michael Bose. He is one of the three Bs.</v>

158
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.940
Did the story know at the time that he was seeing these ads to his eye?

159
00:09:50.941 --> 00:09:55.540
They came across as, especially political because at the time as president,

160
00:09:55.541 --> 00:09:59.980
I'll set a few clear national priorities for America. Over the past three years,

161
00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:04.600
Americans have faced many serious challenges. That summer George W.

162
00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.510
Bush was in a tight race with the Democratic nominee. John Kerry.

163
00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:11.560
In which direction would John Kerry lead and actual political ads.

164
00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:15.520
George Bush is misleading America. We're running wall to wall.

165
00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:19.780
John Kerry has repeatedly opposed weapon's vital to winning the war on terror.

166
00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.600
Yeah, it's going to true. I mean ads for Fahrenheit nine 11

167
00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:25.860
<v 10>I call upon all nations to do everything they can.</v>

168
00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:30.110
<v 0>I mean they did kind of, it kind of blended, right? Yeah.</v>

169
00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:33.783
<v 10>[inaudible]</v>

170
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.210
<v 12>ah, I saw the impact of Fahrenheit nine 11 and late July.</v>

171
00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.850
<v 0>This is David Bossie be number two in an interview that he gave to Cspan.</v>

172
00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:42.210
<v 12>I,</v>

173
00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:46.190
I decided over the couple of weeks that a Fahrenheit was out there that it just

174
00:10:46.191 --> 00:10:49.370
was having a lot bigger impact than even I wanted to admit

175
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:50.910
<v 0>to this day. Uh,</v>

176
00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.860
Fahrenheit nine 11 is the top grossing documentary of all time in that summer of

177
00:10:54.861 --> 00:10:57.980
2004 when the film was out, Bose and Bossy were like, ah,

178
00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:01.220
George Bushes down on the polls. Maybe this film has something to do with it.

179
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:02.503
And so they decided

180
00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:07.510
<v 11>we ought to produce a documentary film that essentially counters Fahrenheit nine</v>

181
00:11:09.621 --> 00:11:10.454
11

182
00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:16.360
<v 0>the we that he's talking about is the conservative nonprofit that he and bossy</v>

183
00:11:16.361 --> 00:11:19.450
run called surprise, surprise citizens United,

184
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:23.380
David Bossie B two is the chairman and president of citizens United,

185
00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:24.850
Michael Bose B one

186
00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:27.760
<v 11>I'm the executive vice president and the general counsel.</v>

187
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:29.390
<v 0>And just for context,</v>

188
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:35.350
the guy who started citizens United is behind one of the most devastating

189
00:11:35.781 --> 00:11:39.540
political ads of all time, Bush and do caucus on crime.

190
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.550
Bush supports the death penalty for first degree murderers.

191
00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:45.210
New conquers not only opposers the death penalty,

192
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.660
he allowed first degree murderers to have weekend passes from prison.

193
00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:53.540
The Willie Horton ad in 1988 that pretty much tanked. Michael Dukakis,

194
00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:54.520
his presidential campaign.

195
00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:57.883
<v 13>Anyhow,</v>

196
00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:02.700
<v 0>after Bose and bossy saw how successful Fahrenheit nine 11 was and more</v>

197
00:12:02.701 --> 00:12:06.540
importantly, how much precious air time the movies ads were getting.

198
00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.033
They thought,

199
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.420
<v 14>let's do this.</v>

200
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.410
We went out and we found the best filmmakers in Hollywood that could do this.

201
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:19.470
Let's make a movie. We produced it.

202
00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:24.740
It was called Celsius 41 11 the temperature at which the brain begins to die,

203
00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:29.370
you know, liberal brains cities by Michael Moore's movie,

204
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:34.270
and then we wanted to run television ads to promote that [inaudible].

205
00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:36.680
<v 11>We ran into that problem,</v>

206
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:38.370
<v 0>a big fat problem.</v>

207
00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:41.450
<v 9>[inaudible]</v>

208
00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:43.190
<v 0>f e c</v>

209
00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:45.980
<v 9>[inaudible],</v>

210
00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:49.760
<v 0>the Federal Election Commission, which by the way was created in 1974</v>

211
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.033
<v 14>sure.</v>

212
00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:57.230
After Watergate where basically people have got to know whether or not they're

213
00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.640
presidents of crop. You had campaign money. Oh I, I'm not a crook.

214
00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:03.270
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

215
00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:07.920
<v 0>funding a crime. Okay.</v>

216
00:13:07.921 --> 00:13:12.921
So the FEC came about post Watergate to basically regulate money and elections

217
00:13:12.931 --> 00:13:15.150
to keep money from corrupting politics.

218
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:16.063
<v 11>And</v>

219
00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:19.500
<v 0>when Bose and Bossy were like, we want to run these ads, the FEC was like,</v>

220
00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:22.470
<v 11>look, your ads do not qualify.</v>

221
00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:25.220
<v 0>Can't do it. Cause even though you are a nonprofit,</v>

222
00:13:25.221 --> 00:13:28.220
you cannot use your corporate piggy bank, I. E.

223
00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.190
Your Treasury to put ads on the air cause you remember that law that we have?

224
00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:31.260
Yeah.

225
00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:35.340
<v 14>John McCain won his battle for campaign finance reform.</v>

226
00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:40.410
<v 15>The 2002 bipartisan campaign before Mag also known as McCain Feingold restricts</v>

227
00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:44.400
the use of corporate money directly for or against candidates.

228
00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:48.830
<v 0>I remember that law FEC said if you ran ads you would be violating that law too.</v>

229
00:13:48.831 --> 00:13:52.700
Which Bossy B two was like, Hey, wait a minute. What about Michael Moore?

230
00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:55.220
This guy is running TV commercials,

231
00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:59.930
which in my opinion we're a lot better than John Kerry's commercials trying to

232
00:13:59.931 --> 00:14:02.600
make George Bush look bad. Why the F

233
00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:04.640
<v 9>[inaudible]</v>

234
00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:08.570
<v 0>does he get to run ads and we don't. The his response was like,</v>

235
00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:10.880
he's media.

236
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.080
He can run ads on TV because he gets a media exemption. You,

237
00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.350
you're not media, y'all are corporate.

238
00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:23.360
<v 11>So at that point in time we decided that we would get in the documentary</v>

239
00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:24.630
filmmaking business,

240
00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:27.090
<v 0>so citizens, United producers,</v>

241
00:14:27.091 --> 00:14:30.030
broken promises in the United Nations at 61

242
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:33.720
<v 15>of the things it's very difficult for outsiders to understand about the UN is</v>

243
00:14:33.721 --> 00:14:36.300
how we all prepared and untrained. Most of its staff are

244
00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:40.280
<v 0>2006 border war, the battle over illegal immigration.</v>

245
00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:44.210
<v 14>We never really crossed the border. The border cross ties that same year,</v>

246
00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:49.390
the Acru has been more concerned about protecting pedophiles than protected.

247
00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:52.070
If a shoulder they produce ACL

248
00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:55.430
<v 0>you at war with America.</v>

249
00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:00.760
<v 11>And by 2008 we had a substantial history of making documentary films that we had</v>

250
00:15:02.121 --> 00:15:05.990
made over that period of times. Several had won awards.

251
00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:06.581
<v 0>Anyhow,</v>

252
00:15:06.581 --> 00:15:10.390
fast forward to January of 2008 the United States is heading into another

253
00:15:10.391 --> 00:15:13.270
presidential election and the two candidates on the democratic side.

254
00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:15.330
<v 10>I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve this message.</v>

255
00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:17.460
I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message.

256
00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:21.370
<v 0>Of course, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and citizens United productions.</v>

257
00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:25.120
That's their nonprofit movie production wing made a new film,

258
00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:30.380
<v 9>vindictive Venal sneaky ideological intolerant.</v>

259
00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:35.990
<v 0>Why are is a good one? Super Subtle. It's called Hillary</v>

260
00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:37.723
<v 9>the moon.</v>

261
00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:42.140
She is steeped in controversy steeped in sleaze.

262
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:43.303
And guess what?

263
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:47.110
<v 11>We faced the same obstacle that we faced in 2004</v>

264
00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:51.100
<v 0>the FTC basically told Bose and Bossy, you can make the movie.</v>

265
00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.740
You just can't let anyone know it exists.

266
00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:59.650
I was forbidden to advertise. Again, this was because of McCain. Fine.

267
00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:03.910
Gold advertisements paid for with corporate money couldn't go on TV or on the

268
00:16:03.911 --> 00:16:07.540
radio 30 to 60 days before an election or primary.

269
00:16:07.541 --> 00:16:12.541
People don't understand how McCain-Feingold criminalized political speech.

270
00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:18.600
My lawyers told me I would be indicted and put in prison for five years per

271
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:25.750
count. Meaning every time they found a violation I could be put in prison.

272
00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:30.110
And so, so we decided to not let the FEC,

273
00:16:30.111 --> 00:16:34.920
the federal election commission come for us. We actually sued them. We sue.

274
00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:39.030
Well, we sue. This is Jim. Bob B3.

275
00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:41.700
He is in Indiana based campaign finance lawyer.

276
00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:46.790
<v 10>Mr [inaudible]. Thank you MR chief justice and may it please the court. Okay.</v>

277
00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:50.400
<v 0>So the three B's take their Hillary, the movie case to Federal Court.</v>

278
00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:51.930
<v 11>Um, we lost,</v>

279
00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:56.150
<v 0>they lost, they appeal directly to the Supreme Court.</v>

280
00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:57.340
<v 10>And Voila.</v>

281
00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:01.870
We'll hear argument today in case zero eight two oh five citizens United versus

282
00:17:01.871 --> 00:17:05.500
the Federal Election Commission. Mr. Olsen, right. So we're,

283
00:17:05.501 --> 00:17:07.840
we're in the courtroom now, right?

284
00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:10.510
I'm just a patient in the political process.

285
00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:15.790
<v 0>Say A, I remember the urine unsurprising argument.</v>

286
00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:17.710
This is journalist and author Marshall Coil.

287
00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.630
She says you had the lawyer for the BS.

288
00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:24.130
Ted Olsen taking a very strong position, basically saying, look,

289
00:17:24.131 --> 00:17:27.220
by not allowing us to run our ads for Hillary, the movie,

290
00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:30.700
it's wrong and you're violating our first amendment rights

291
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:32.900
<v 10>in the case that you consider today,</v>

292
00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:38.290
it is a felony for a small nonprofit corporation to offer interested viewers.

293
00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:43.730
A 90 minute political documentary. Ooh, one more time.

294
00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:48.530
The 90 minute documentary again, this 90 minute documentary. Yeah.

295
00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:53.240
90 documentary, a 90 minute documentary documentary.

296
00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:57.370
90 minute movie. The 90 minute documentary in 90 minutes.

297
00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:03.030
[inaudible] this 90 minute documentary in 90 minute documentary in 90 minute

298
00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:06.910
documentary about a candidate for the nation's highest office.

299
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:10.830
Just 90 minute documentary in 90 minute documentary.

300
00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:14.020
<v 16>Okay. So you know how like when you hear a certain word over and over and over,</v>

301
00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:18.970
it just turns into Mush at 90 minute documentary. Indeed, this documentary,

302
00:18:18.971 --> 00:18:22.150
I mean it happens all the time when you listen to supreme court oral arguments

303
00:18:22.151 --> 00:18:26.020
documentary, but particularly in this case, uh, in his opening statement,

304
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:31.180
Ted Olson said that word documentary so many times.

305
00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.820
It just started to sound so weird.

306
00:18:33.821 --> 00:18:37.000
But the point he was trying to make by saying it again and again and again,

307
00:18:37.001 --> 00:18:38.090
the documentary is,

308
00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:42.850
is it citizens United was making a documentary that discussions things that are

309
00:18:42.851 --> 00:18:47.530
important to the public. They were not quote, electioneering, electioneering,

310
00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:51.370
electioneering, electioneering electioneering. Okay, election here.

311
00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:54.400
That's another a word you hear over and over again. You're just like, wow,

312
00:18:54.401 --> 00:18:57.370
what a weird word. But what it means is like campaign advocacy,

313
00:18:57.371 --> 00:19:01.150
and there are certain words, eight of them actually words and phrases like,

314
00:19:01.151 --> 00:19:04.540
vote for elect support,

315
00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:08.590
cast your ballot for vote against defeat.

316
00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:11.200
Reject those words.

317
00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:13.960
Or the functional equivalent of those words according to the court,

318
00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:18.930
suddenly make something advocacy electioneering and therefore regulated.

319
00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:23.320
But citizens United said, look, this is a movie about Hillary Clinton. You know,

320
00:19:23.321 --> 00:19:26.450
we don't save, vote or don't vote for her. And you know,

321
00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:30.610
it still may be shown in theaters sold on DVDs.

322
00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:35.380
We're trying to disseminate the movie to an independent buyer who will then

323
00:19:35.381 --> 00:19:39.750
offer it, say through HBO, which is make a movie. Indeed.

324
00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.270
This documentary, yes,

325
00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:46.440
is the very definition of robust on inhibited debate about a subject of intense

326
00:19:47.441 --> 00:19:52.120
political interest that the first amendment is there to guarantee

327
00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:59.650
Mr. Olsen if the film were, but then liberal justice is like a David Souter.

328
00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:00.970
We're like, come on,

329
00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:03.930
<v 17>see, I mean, I've got the government's brief over and it open up.</v>

330
00:20:03.931 --> 00:20:07.930
Pages 18 and 19 was the quotations. Uh,

331
00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:12.480
she lie about anything. She's deceitful, she's ruthless, cunning, dishonest,

332
00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:17.700
uh, do anything for power. I will speak dishonestly, uh, reckless.

333
00:20:17.701 --> 00:20:21.200
That congenital liar's solely lacking in qualifications,

334
00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:23.040
not qualified as commander in chief.

335
00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:27.990
I mean this sounds to me like campaign advocacy. Electioneering this is eight,

336
00:20:27.991 --> 00:20:29.100
don't vote for Jones.

337
00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:34.160
<v 16>This is a long discussion of the record qualifications,</v>

338
00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:38.360
history and conduct of someone who was in the political arena.

339
00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:40.200
So they go back and forth for a while.

340
00:20:40.201 --> 00:20:44.330
What could was citizens United just making an elaborate campaign ad but dressing

341
00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:48.010
an episode doc or was it actually a dog? But what is the, between the

342
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:52.510
<v 0>ten second commercial and say the 90 minute infomercial? Like how can you tell?</v>

343
00:20:52.511 --> 00:20:55.570
Is it about length? Is it about who's doing the speaking blah, blah, blah.

344
00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:59.730
As Marcia Coil said, this part of the argument is unsurprising.

345
00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:00.793
<v 18>Thank you council.</v>

346
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:05.600
Then Mr. Stewart, uh,

347
00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:09.140
the government I got out of strategic justice and may it please the court,

348
00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:13.760
and this is where things really start turning right. So the government's lawyer,

349
00:21:13.761 --> 00:21:14.594
Malcolm Stewart

350
00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:18.360
<v 0>gets up there and he says, these ads for this movie and this movie</v>

351
00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:21.930
<v 18>are clearly electioneering come on.</v>

352
00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:25.590
A court should find that an ad is the functional equivalent of express advocacy

353
00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:29.910
only if the ad is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than it's an

354
00:21:29.911 --> 00:21:32.550
appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.

355
00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:36.270
<v 0>That's a very complicated way of saying if you watched the damn movie it,</v>

356
00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:39.510
you just can tell it looks like an ad. It smells like an ad. It's an ad.

357
00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:43.100
<v 18>It's certainly been a recurring phenomenon in the past that candidates would</v>

358
00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:46.590
air, for instance, 30 minute infomercial. So that's all fine and good.

359
00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:51.620
But then Walmart airs an advertisement that says we have candidate action

360
00:21:51.931 --> 00:21:53.730
figures for sale. Come buy them.

361
00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:58.170
That counts as an electionary in communication if it's aired in the right place

362
00:21:58.171 --> 00:21:59.910
at the right time, that would be covered. Now,

363
00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:02.160
when Chief Justice Roberts and also Alito,

364
00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:06.630
you think that the constitution required congress to draw the line where it did

365
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:12.110
<v 0>testing Malcolm Stewart probing how far the government can go.</v>

366
00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:14.040
What's your answer to Mr Olson's?

367
00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:17.280
Like if the government is allowed to say like that thing you're doing as an ad,

368
00:22:17.281 --> 00:22:21.780
therefore it should be taken off the air at certain times or where's the limit

369
00:22:21.781 --> 00:22:23.910
to that? Like what if the ad,

370
00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:28.020
as the government defines it is in a DVD or a book,

371
00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:29.850
can it then just yank those away too?

372
00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:33.720
<v 18>But the constitution permit the restriction of all of those as well.</v>

373
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:38.130
I think the constant constitution would have permitted congress to apply the

374
00:22:38.131 --> 00:22:40.830
electioneering communication restrictions to the extent that there are

375
00:22:40.831 --> 00:22:42.500
otherwise. Any here where

376
00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:45.080
<v 0>you almost hear the conservative justice as being like, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa,</v>

377
00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:48.130
Whoa, whoa. Did he just say, did he just say what I think he just said?

378
00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:51.710
<v 18>Did you say that? That's pretty incredible. You think that if, if, uh,</v>

379
00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:53.390
a book was published,

380
00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:58.400
a campaign biography that was the functional equivalent of express advocacy,

381
00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:01.580
a that could be banned? I'm not saying it could be banned.

382
00:23:01.581 --> 00:23:05.540
I'm saying that Congress could prohibit the use of corporate treasury funds and

383
00:23:05.541 --> 00:23:08.860
could require a quarter. If it has to get one name,

384
00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:13.720
one use of the candidate's name, it would be covered. Correct.

385
00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:18.190
If that's, if it's a 500 page book and at the end it says,

386
00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:22.630
and so vote for x, the government could ban that.

387
00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:23.571
Well,

388
00:23:23.571 --> 00:23:27.860
if it says for exit would be express advocacy and it would be covered by the

389
00:23:27.861 --> 00:23:32.180
preexisting federal election campaign act provision now comes to it tries to

390
00:23:32.181 --> 00:23:34.610
wriggle out of this trap. If it's a book and it is,

391
00:23:34.611 --> 00:23:38.510
he brings in some stuff about that first amendment about media protections,

392
00:23:38.511 --> 00:23:39.500
media corporations,

393
00:23:39.501 --> 00:23:42.440
the institutional press would have a greater first amendment right.

394
00:23:42.441 --> 00:23:46.290
That that pop question is obviously not presented that the other two things that

395
00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:49.280
we're an advocacy organization that had a book,

396
00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.080
but Justice Kennedy pins it back down.

397
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:54.830
Your position is that under the constitution, uh,

398
00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:58.280
the advertising for this book or the sale for the book itself could be

399
00:23:58.281 --> 00:24:00.710
prohibited within the 60, 30 day period.

400
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:04.250
If the book contained the functional equivalent of express advocacy,

401
00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:07.990
<v 0>what happens is they eventually get him to say</v>

402
00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:11.790
<v 18>if it's a block and at the end it says,</v>

403
00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:13.920
vote for X. Yes.

404
00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:17.370
Our position would be that the corporation could be required to use PAC funds

405
00:24:17.371 --> 00:24:19.710
rather than general treasury. And if they didn't, you could ban it.

406
00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:23.640
If they didn't, we could prohibit the publication of the book.

407
00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:27.150
<v 0>You mean the government can ban books?</v>

408
00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:31.580
<v 19>[inaudible]</v>

409
00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:35.360
<v 20>being a, you know, in the courtroom and hearing that answer, well,</v>

410
00:24:35.361 --> 00:24:36.950
it was stunned silence.

411
00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.380
<v 0>That's Jim, Bob B3, v I. D. A</v>

412
00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:44.480
that anything the government could do,

413
00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:47.300
could amount to banning a book, you know,

414
00:24:47.301 --> 00:24:51.440
sent a shockwave through the courtroom and that's Jeffrey Toobin from the New

415
00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.360
Yorker. He was also in the audience that day.

416
00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:58.390
<v 20>This deep dark kind of secret was now exposed to the,</v>

417
00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:03.650
to the light of day to the public that they really were in the book banning book

418
00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:05.300
burning business.

419
00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:10.550
<v 0>The question of the book underlines how difficult it is when the government gets</v>

420
00:25:12.601 --> 00:25:15.690
into regulating a political speech.

421
00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.120
Malcolm Stewart kept protesting like, no, no, no, no, no, you're not.

422
00:25:20.121 --> 00:25:20.990
You're misunderstanding.

423
00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:22.380
<v 18>I'm not saying it could be bad.</v>

424
00:25:22.381 --> 00:25:25.800
I'm saying the congress could prohibit the use of corporate treasury.

425
00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:28.660
<v 0>Well, this is not about banning political speech.</v>

426
00:25:28.661 --> 00:25:32.860
It's about regulating the money used to make that speech because if we don't

427
00:25:32.861 --> 00:25:37.310
sometimes do that, some voices will be way too loud. Okay. That's the F,

428
00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:37.631
you know?

429
00:25:37.631 --> 00:25:42.040
That's a fine distinction in the minds of the average person and it's a

430
00:25:42.041 --> 00:25:44.260
distinction she says. It just got lost that day

431
00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.300
<v 18>because Congress said,</v>

432
00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:49.180
if we accept your constitutional argument where establishing a precedent that

433
00:25:49.181 --> 00:25:52.390
you yourself say would extend to banding the book,

434
00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:54.670
assuming a particular person pays for it.

435
00:25:55.630 --> 00:26:00.630
I think the court has already hilled in both in Austin and in McConnell,

436
00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:02.083
but congress

437
00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:30.350
<v 0>coming up,</v>

438
00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:35.150
we go behind the scenes into the minds actually if the justices as they

439
00:26:35.151 --> 00:26:39.560
deliberate backstage about what to do next and things get kind of weird.

440
00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:40.763
<v 9>Yeah,</v>

441
00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:55.660

450
00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:30.760
<v 2>He's from Washington from snap, snap,</v>

451
00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:35.990
duck live walks Nashville Wyman theater firing mark 16 and I'm bringing the best

452
00:27:36.131 --> 00:27:38.410
of what goes in the world last Friday.

453
00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:42.700
Laugh some more amazing night out and yes, she's coming.

454
00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:45.190
The funniest woman in the world, Jen Kober.

455
00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:50.890
I do my hung in the lady forest. Jen POBA rocks a brand new story.

456
00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:53.800
Get tickets it snap judgment. That'll watch it.

457
00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:57.370
I've never gotten applause for it before. If you guys could call my mom,

458
00:27:57.371 --> 00:27:59.140
that'd be awesome. She's still pissed

459
00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:06.220
<v 21>in the supreme court today. A debate about the movies.</v>

460
00:28:06.221 --> 00:28:10.870
Short of producers have a withering 90 minute movie critique of Hillary Clinton

461
00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:15.340
argued that part of the McCain Feingold campaign finance law is

462
00:28:15.341 --> 00:28:16.600
unconstitutional.

463
00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:19.110
<v 0>All right, so after oral arguments wrapped up,</v>

464
00:28:19.111 --> 00:28:24.111
the justices retreated to what is perhaps the most secretive place in the known

465
00:28:25.771 --> 00:28:30.090
universe and the most private and perhaps important place inside the supreme

466
00:28:30.091 --> 00:28:35.091
court for at least inside the court justices and only then meet together around

467
00:28:35.191 --> 00:28:37.230
a table and the justices conference room.

468
00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:42.950
They discuss the cases heard at oral argument and begin the process of reaching

469
00:28:43.141 --> 00:28:47.100
a decision of the court. This is a place where cameras will never go.

470
00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:51.720
No one can enter the room except for some reasons cspan. Once we returned.

471
00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:55.200
Now two Seaspans feature documentary, the Supreme Court,

472
00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:56.850
once upon a time Seaspan,

473
00:28:56.851 --> 00:29:01.851
those bastards were able to get into this room and film the table and the chair.

474
00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:05.670
That's terrific. No, wait a minute. I'm actually quite jealous because they did.

475
00:29:05.671 --> 00:29:06.630
They didn't let us do that.

476
00:29:06.631 --> 00:29:10.080
They didn't let us see the special room or speak to the justices.

477
00:29:10.081 --> 00:29:13.740
So Seaspan yeah, they have some kind of deal with the devil. Anyhow,

478
00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:18.330
the point is we don't know what happened in that room on that day,

479
00:29:18.331 --> 00:29:22.140
but we can piece together a couple of things. We can imagine the rest.

480
00:29:22.141 --> 00:29:23.210
I mean we know that they went

481
00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:27.850
<v 16>in, Clarence Thomas put on some tunes. RBG was like, wow,</v>

482
00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:30.460
that book thing I need to drink. Actually,

483
00:29:30.461 --> 00:29:32.140
we don't know that either of those two things happen,

484
00:29:32.141 --> 00:29:35.770
but it makes sense to me that Clarence Thomas would like the doobies.

485
00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:38.290
That just feels right,

486
00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:44.460
but what do know is that the justice sat down in the usual order. They said,

487
00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:47.430
we sit at the conference table in the same places every day.

488
00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:50.150
Chief Justice Roberts gets things gone with some discussion.

489
00:29:50.151 --> 00:29:53.430
I initiate the discussion because he always does for an argued case. I'll say,

490
00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:57.600
this case is about this. The arguments are so-and-so,

491
00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:01.590
and I think we should reverse or affirm so that there is some conversation and

492
00:30:01.591 --> 00:30:04.150
then, okay, because again, this is standard.

493
00:30:04.151 --> 00:30:08.620
The chief justice called for a vote. This is the part we care about.

494
00:30:08.621 --> 00:30:10.540
He presumably asked his colleagues, okay,

495
00:30:10.541 --> 00:30:13.330
who here thinks that citizens United has a case?

496
00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:17.980
Now we know that the four liberal justices, Stephen's skins were briar suitor.

497
00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:21.430
We're like, no, they do not have a case.

498
00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:24.910
All that citizens United is doing is making a campaign ad.

499
00:30:24.911 --> 00:30:28.000
This is electioneering. They're pretending it's a doc, but really it's not.

500
00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:30.250
They should be regulated. On the other side,

501
00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:34.330
we know that the four conservatives, Scalia, Thomas Alito, Roberts,

502
00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:37.720
we're like, yeah, they got a case.

503
00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:42.460
Citizens United's First Amendment rights are being pinched and so you had a

504
00:30:42.461 --> 00:30:46.510
split like you often do on this court for Liberals, for conservatives,

505
00:30:46.511 --> 00:30:50.320
but there are nine justices, so as always, all attention turned

506
00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.750
to the man in the middle. Justice Anthony County,

507
00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:58.560
<v 22>so justice Kennedy is 80 he's been on the court for almost 30 years.</v>

508
00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:01.860
He is often the swing vote, making his opinion critical.

509
00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:05.980
<v 1>He is considered the court's pivotal swing vote in accord that's basically split</v>

510
00:31:05.981 --> 00:31:08.920
down the middle for four. Kennedy is the ultimate swing vote,

511
00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:10.750
the one ring to rule them all.

512
00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:14.760
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

513
00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:16.690
<v 16>all right, let's just talk about Justice Kennedy for a second.</v>

514
00:31:16.691 --> 00:31:21.691
He has been the swing vote on this course so many times that he's often called

515
00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:25.480
the most powerful person in America and most powerful man in the country and by

516
00:31:25.481 --> 00:31:29.170
many stretches because very often his vote is the only vote that matters.

517
00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:34.080
You could argue that this one dude has determined more about your life as an

518
00:31:34.081 --> 00:31:36.960
American than almost any other single guy,

519
00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:43.720
but from the outside, for people who don't really know much about the court,

520
00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:47.470
I e me, you know, maybe not you but me.

521
00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:52.780
It can be really hard to predict what he is going to do on any given case,

522
00:31:52.781 --> 00:31:53.614
which way he's going to.

523
00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:59.210
<v 1>For example, on a big voting rights case, he sides with the conservatives,</v>

524
00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:03.440
the Marshall Plan was very good to the Morale Act of no northwest ordinance but

525
00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:06.980
but on eminent domain, he sides with the liberals, hey showing him,

526
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:12.190
it does say to be ronic than 100% goes to the developer and not to the property

527
00:32:12.861 --> 00:32:15.860
owner. Now on gun rights, the Heller case,

528
00:32:15.861 --> 00:32:18.850
if you talked about he swung conservative. Hey Pace.

529
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:21.800
I view it as a general right to bear arms, right?

530
00:32:21.801 --> 00:32:25.160
Without reference to the militia either way. But on environmental protection,

531
00:32:25.161 --> 00:32:28.820
he goes liberal greater the harm, the greater the risk class action.

532
00:32:28.821 --> 00:32:31.420
He goes conservative under this, not clear to me what,

533
00:32:31.421 --> 00:32:35.960
what is the unlawful policy? Gay Marriage. He goes, liberal,

534
00:32:35.961 --> 00:32:40.010
same sex couples may exercise the fundamental right to marry all states, no

535
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:41.930
<v 4>longer made this liberty be denied to them.</v>

536
00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:44.970
<v 2>Does this winger, this swing the nose going?</v>

537
00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:49.630
I wanted the actions. So,

538
00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:53.210
<v 0>and when the chief justice went around the room and got to Kennedy and was like,</v>

539
00:32:53.211 --> 00:32:56.480
all right, Kennedy, what's it going to be this time from the outside?

540
00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:00.050
It was anyone's guess. But as I mentioned,

541
00:33:00.051 --> 00:33:04.400
one of the sort of cool things about the citizens United case is it gives you a

542
00:33:04.401 --> 00:33:08.150
little window into the mind of this very powerful,

543
00:33:08.151 --> 00:33:12.590
very mysterious man. So before he answers, let's go into his mind.

544
00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:17.203
<v 2>Okay.</v>

545
00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:21.900
<v 23>I was born in Romania, Bucharest, Romania.</v>

546
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:23.490
In the days of communism.

547
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:28.730
<v 4>You may wonder why is there an eastern European man in the brain of justice,</v>

548
00:33:28.731 --> 00:33:31.700
Anthony Kennedy. That'll make sense. In just a minute. Bear with me for now.

549
00:33:31.701 --> 00:33:33.980
All you need to know is that this is Alex Kazinski.

550
00:33:33.981 --> 00:33:37.550
He's an influential judge who sits in the ninth circuit in California.

551
00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:42.280
<v 23>Yeah. My father was, um, was actually a party member. Uh, he was, uh,</v>

552
00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:45.670
a member of the party before the war. This is world war two.

553
00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:49.850
He totally believed in communism and so there was a great system and uh, uh,

554
00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:51.140
reviewed that.

555
00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:54.020
<v 4>But Alex remembers a moment when he was at his dad's office,</v>

556
00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:57.680
<v 23>I guess I was about seven years old or seven or eight or something. And um,</v>

557
00:33:57.860 --> 00:33:59.160
my father wasn't there,

558
00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:02.840
<v 4>but a couple of other comedies officials were, and as they're standing there,</v>

559
00:34:02.841 --> 00:34:04.940
Alex picks up a newspaper, starts reading it,

560
00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:10.140
<v 23>newspaper called Free Romania. And so I live at free Romania.</v>

561
00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:13.740
And then I sort of, I have sent to be funny, I guess I said, well,

562
00:34:13.741 --> 00:34:16.560
I don't know why they call it free Romania because as so many people in person,

563
00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.390
you just thought he was making a joke.

564
00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:21.270
But apparently this got my father into very serious trouble.

565
00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:25.770
The officials essentially threatened his dad because of this joke question was

566
00:34:25.771 --> 00:34:29.280
whether the, they were teaching me disloyal things at home.

567
00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:34.350
Eventually they cleared them, but it was a, it was touching girl. So after that,

568
00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:36.630
my father had this a signal. He says,

569
00:34:36.631 --> 00:34:41.460
if you're ever in public with me and you say something and you hear me pinching

570
00:34:41.461 --> 00:34:46.230
my nose and sniffing, uh, you just stop talking, whatever it is you're saying.

571
00:34:46.231 --> 00:34:49.950
Usually you don't give an explanation. You don't continue to just stop talking.

572
00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:57.250
<v 4>Years later, Alice Kazinski would leave Romania, leave communism behind,</v>

573
00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:01.270
come to California, become a lawyer, then a clerk.

574
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:05.060
<v 23>Okay. Clerk in a Sacramento for Anthony Kennedy,</v>

575
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:07.550
who was then a new judge on the ninth circuit.

576
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:10.600
<v 4>He says, he told Anthony Kennedy this story. Oh yes.</v>

577
00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:13.450
And they talked a lot about what it's like to live in a place where you can't

578
00:35:13.451 --> 00:35:16.090
speak your mind. Oh, sure. Oh, sure. Of course.

579
00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:19.750
Now who knows what exact effect has had on Anthony Kennedy's mind,

580
00:35:19.751 --> 00:35:23.510
but we know that that story is in there. My honor,

581
00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:26.410
I will do my best mixed in with all the cub scouts,

582
00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:30.420
both service youth and the sights and smells of Sacramento, California,

583
00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:31.273
where he grew up,

584
00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:36.490
of course mixed in with all the Catholic church services and

585
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:41.310
stuff from, you know, summer spent, an Austria teaching.

586
00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:43.350
But we know that story was in there.

587
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:46.890
And the reason why I pointed out was that we also know that at a certain point

588
00:35:46.891 --> 00:35:50.670
growing up, Anthony Kennedy read a book that really lodged in his head.

589
00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:54.720
1984 one of the most important works ever written.

590
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:58.920
1984 of course, is the dystopian novel by George Orwell.

591
00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:03.980
Kennedy talks about it all the time and speeches in 1984. Um,

592
00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:08.520
the dictatorship was always surveilling you, trying to control your thoughts.

593
00:36:09.090 --> 00:36:09.923
<v 2>You thought</v>

594
00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:14.260
<v 1>in 1984 has one of the most brilliant scenes in literature.</v>

595
00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:20.130
The protagonist is being tortured.

596
00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:21.830
<v 24>Do you remember writing in your diary?</v>

597
00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:25.670
Freedom is the freedom to say two plus two equals four.

598
00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:28.160
<v 1>They want him to say the two and two is five.</v>

599
00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:33.320
<v 2>Okay.</v>

600
00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:37.250
<v 1>If finally you can't stay on the torture anymore. I don't think you like it,</v>

601
00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:39.450
please. Okay, two and two is five

602
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:42.540
but the torture continues.

603
00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:45.323
<v 2>Okay,</v>

604
00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:47.070
<v 1>why are you continuing to use it?</v>

605
00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:51.070
The torture continues not until you just say it, but until you believe it.

606
00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:55.760
<v 24>I was good, which to wish swayed me did.</v>

607
00:36:55.761 --> 00:37:00.680
You can see fine Red Sea better.

608
00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:06.550
<v 1>This is a powerful reminder that governments want to plan your destiny.</v>

609
00:37:07.641 --> 00:37:11.000
They want to plan what you think and this must never happen.

610
00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:12.790
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

611
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:13.780
<v 4>so clearly</v>

612
00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:15.740
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

613
00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:17.990
<v 4>inside Anthony Kennedy's mind,</v>

614
00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:21.290
and maybe this is as close to an ideology as he has,

615
00:37:21.291 --> 00:37:25.190
he's often talked about as having very little discernible ideology.

616
00:37:25.191 --> 00:37:29.030
Well maybe this is it inside his mind. There is a fear,

617
00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:34.360
a primal fear of the government getting too close of it reaching its

618
00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:40.250
authoritarian tentacles into our lives. In our minds,

619
00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:41.743
in our bodies.

620
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:45.560
<v 1>The framers add idea,</v>

621
00:37:45.561 --> 00:37:48.530
which is central to western thought.

622
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:52.940
This is how we put it at his supreme court confirmation hearing in 1987 and that

623
00:37:52.941 --> 00:37:57.941
is that there is a zone of liberty as on a protection,

624
00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:04.340
a line that's drawn where the individual can tell the government beyond this

625
00:38:04.341 --> 00:38:05.480
line, you may not go

626
00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:08.670
<v 2>itself.</v>

627
00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:13.820
<v 4>To go back to the secret room</v>

628
00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:20.430
when Chief Justice Roberts asked Justice Kennedy, all right, Kennedy,

629
00:38:20.431 --> 00:38:23.490
which way you're going to swing. I imagine what he said,

630
00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:26.190
emphasis on the word imagine is, all right, MR chief,

631
00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:30.930
I know you think I'm a swinger. I know everybody else thinks I'm a swinger,

632
00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:33.840
but on this issue, I do not swing.

633
00:38:33.841 --> 00:38:36.190
Not only do I think that citizens United

634
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:37.023
<v 0>has a case,</v>

635
00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:41.340
but I think that campaign finance law that would limit their speech should

636
00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:46.280
<v 9>government</v>

637
00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:51.280
<v 3>United States stood in front of our court and said that it was lawful to ban a</v>

638
00:38:51.791 --> 00:38:54.640
book that, that, that, that can, that can't be lie.

639
00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:00.023
<v 9>No.</v>

640
00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:04.790
<v 0>We knew that two things happened after Kennedy sort of gave his answer and said,</v>

641
00:39:04.791 --> 00:39:06.290
let's go big. Let's tear it down.

642
00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:09.440
We know that the Conservatives on the court were like, oh,

643
00:39:09.441 --> 00:39:12.680
I like where you're going with this, and they started to gravitate to his side.

644
00:39:12.681 --> 00:39:17.000
We also knew the David Souter. He was the justice in court.

645
00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:21.730
<v 17>Ah, she lie about anything. She's deceitful. She's ruthless, cunning, dishonest.</v>

646
00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:24.400
I mean, this sounds to me like campaign advocacy,

647
00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:27.740
<v 0>who is basically accusing citizens United of trying to pretend they weren't</v>

648
00:39:27.741 --> 00:39:29.270
playing politics when really they were,

649
00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:34.400
we know that justice Souter got really pissed because if we go into David's

650
00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:36.200
suitors bind his room within a room,

651
00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:39.780
<v 4>the view is very different.</v>

652
00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:44.640
David Souter is a new Englander. He's quiet.

653
00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:48.120
Bookish spends long afternoons reading,

654
00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:51.600
walking through the silent hemlock forest.

655
00:39:52.170 --> 00:39:55.650
This is a story that suitors home in New Hampshire was stack with so many books

656
00:39:55.651 --> 00:39:58.080
that his house actually needed a new foundation,

657
00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:02.550
which is to say his reaction here was very out of character. By all accounts,

658
00:40:02.551 --> 00:40:06.620
he was not happy because Kennedy's whole thing that liberty is the law.

659
00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:10.500
Nothing should compromise that that for suiter set off alarm bells

660
00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:15.460
<v 17>because I exercise my liberty to the greatest possible extent.</v>

661
00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:18.160
I can suppress the rights of a lot of people.

662
00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:22.700
<v 0>That is suitor giving a talk in 2012 and what he means is that liberty and</v>

663
00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:24.760
equality have to be imbalanced.

664
00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:27.990
<v 17>Both can't win all the way all the time,</v>

665
00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:30.870
<v 0>and if corporate money just starts pouring into elections,</v>

666
00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:35.520
that's basically handing a megaphone to the richest people in society.

667
00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:40.700
<v 17>There's got to be the possibility of a limitation on corporations so that they</v>

668
00:40:41.071 --> 00:40:43.310
do not drown out other species.

669
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:48.710
<v 0>No, we don't really know what David Tudor was thinking in this moment,</v>

670
00:40:48.711 --> 00:40:53.540
but I imagined them thinking forward to everything that was about to happen.

671
00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:57.020
<v 25>An explosion and political campaign donation. The Koch brothers,</v>

672
00:40:57.070 --> 00:40:57.903
the Koch brothers,

673
00:40:58.370 --> 00:41:03.290
these two brothers are trying to buy American or billionaires are backing

674
00:41:03.291 --> 00:41:06.330
Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump, essentially super packs.

675
00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:08.060
They're allowed to give unlimited funds.

676
00:41:08.061 --> 00:41:10.580
Hillary Clinton gaining support from the wealthy,

677
00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:15.260
secretive billionaire hedge fund tycoon is credited by many with playing an

678
00:41:15.261 --> 00:41:17.780
instrumental role in Donald Trump's election.

679
00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:26.870
<v 0>Whatever he was actually thinking that moment.</v>

680
00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:31.040
We know that after Kennedy made his stance, said, let's go bake justice.

681
00:41:31.041 --> 00:41:34.250
Souter Justice Souter wrote a very, very

682
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:35.680
<v 25>strong draft,</v>

683
00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:40.490
<v 0>a real bridge burning descent. It's explosive. Marsha Coyle, Jeff Toobin,</v>

684
00:41:40.491 --> 00:41:42.650
Jeffrey Rosen of the national constitution center.

685
00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:46.640
He said that Kennedy's opinion is really an illegitimate use of the court's

686
00:41:46.641 --> 00:41:47.474
power. Yeah.

687
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:50.500
<v 25>The way the court was proceeding with wrong</v>

688
00:41:51.370 --> 00:41:54.340
<v 0>suitor accuses the court of judicial activism,</v>

689
00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:58.000
overreaching of taking a narrow case,

690
00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:02.650
a teeny little case about one teeny little film and then using it illegitimately

691
00:42:02.651 --> 00:42:07.651
as a hobby horse to really rewrite the laws of campaign finance regulation.

692
00:42:08.410 --> 00:42:12.370
He argued that this kind of move essentially makes them,

693
00:42:12.371 --> 00:42:14.950
the court look like a bunch of political hacks.

694
00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:17.800
It's questioning the integrity of the court itself.

695
00:42:19.410 --> 00:42:19.420
<v 4>No,</v>

696
00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:23.110
unfortunately we can't read that descent that pseudo wrote because his papers

697
00:42:23.111 --> 00:42:25.840
won't be public until 50 years after his death.

698
00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:29.590
All we know is that he most certainly sent a draft around to the other eight

699
00:42:30.130 --> 00:42:35.130
justices and then what I've been told is just Souter went to chief justice route

700
00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:38.450
<v 25>births and said, basically, look, you know,</v>

701
00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:43.160
if we do this now, we will look bad.

702
00:42:43.161 --> 00:42:47.810
Your court, the Roberts court will look bad.

703
00:42:47.811 --> 00:42:51.170
Someone described his argument as a,

704
00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:56.380
there are a few institutional hot buttons that you press and the court stops and

705
00:42:58.970 --> 00:43:03.080
thinks, and just as suitor was pressing one of those hot buttons,

706
00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:07.380
<v 0>apparently saying to a chief justice that your cord is going to look bad is like</v>

707
00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:11.290
the supreme court equivalent of going nuclear. In the meantime,

708
00:43:11.291 --> 00:43:14.020
while all this is happening, you've got the three B's, bows, Busey, Bob,

709
00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:17.540
<v 6>a Bose [inaudible], Bose Vasia,</v>

710
00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:19.863
[inaudible] bows,

711
00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:22.780
<v 0>just dying for an outcome. And apparently every day</v>

712
00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:27.050
<v 11>we would go down to the court to see 'em if they were gonna issue the decision</v>

713
00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:31.190
in our case that day. And of course, each day, no decision,

714
00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:33.860
no decision, no decision.

715
00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:35.700
<v 25>Yeah. And it's now the end of June.</v>

716
00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:38.760
<v 11>So now we're down to the last day of the court,</v>

717
00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:40.690
<v 0>10:00 AM June 29th.</v>

718
00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:45.720
<v 25>We're back in the court, uh, before, uh, the justices come on the bench,</v>

719
00:43:46.450 --> 00:43:50.400
the clerk of the court walks into the courtroom and, uh,

720
00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:55.380
goes up to Ted Olson. He is, if you recall the lawyer for the BS and says,

721
00:43:55.381 --> 00:43:58.560
I'm going to have to talk to you. Uh, something later.

722
00:43:58.561 --> 00:44:02.910
Something unusual is going to happen. And Ted Olsen, uh, he told me later,

723
00:44:02.911 --> 00:44:06.000
his first thought was, oh, did I do something wrong?

724
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:09.870
<v 0>The Marshall Calls order</v>

725
00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:10.870
<v 6>the honorable,</v>

726
00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:16.150
the chief justice and the associate justices at the Supreme Court of the United

727
00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:20.080
States. Oh, Yay. Oh, Yay. Oh, Yay.

728
00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:26.350
<v 0>The chief opens the session. And then in 1964,</v>

729
00:44:26.351 --> 00:44:27.970
Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act.

730
00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:32.380
Kennedy reads an opinion in a different case and then RBG

731
00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:37.060
<v 10>reads a descent, but they had no vested right to promotion in a different case.</v>

732
00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:40.480
And then Scalia gets up there, the bark of state law remains,

733
00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:44.590
but his bite is not with an opinion in a different case,

734
00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:47.440
this is a strange result. But finally,

735
00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:49.720
Chief Justice Roberts comes back in.

736
00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:54.310
And so the very last thing the chief justice says before he, you know,

737
00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:59.140
ends the term [inaudible] case number Oh eight two oh five citizens United

738
00:44:59.141 --> 00:45:01.270
versus the Federal Election Commission. Yes,

739
00:45:01.310 --> 00:45:05.570
<v 0>there will be re argument in citizens United is set for re argument later this</v>

740
00:45:05.571 --> 00:45:09.290
term. Boom. Chief Justice Roberts basically says,

741
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:11.480
we're not going to make up our mind today.

742
00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:17.360
We're going to come back and talk about this again and we're going to debate it

743
00:45:17.361 --> 00:45:21.260
on Kennedy's terms is the campaign finance law McCain-Feingold

744
00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:22.530
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

745
00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:23.850
<v 0>an infringement of free speech.</v>

746
00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:24.930
<v 2>Okay.</v>

747
00:45:24.930 --> 00:45:28.020
<v 0>And then after he says that this is what happens next.</v>

748
00:45:28.370 --> 00:45:32.140
<v 10>Now we note with sadness that this is the last session in which our friend and</v>

749
00:45:32.141 --> 00:45:36.490
colleague Justice David Souter will be on the bench with us. Sooner

750
00:45:37.350 --> 00:45:38.183
<v 17>is out.</v>

751
00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:40.840
<v 10>We wish him the best in his well deserved retirement.</v>

752
00:45:41.170 --> 00:45:45.270
On this occasion we have sent justice Souter a letter that I will now read

753
00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:48.970
stated today. Dear David,

754
00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:53.320
we have all felt a profound sense of loss since the announcement of your

755
00:45:53.321 --> 00:45:57.640
decision to retire. Eventually he quotes the New England poet Robert Frost.

756
00:45:57.820 --> 00:46:02.820
You understand your desire to trade white marble for white mountains and return

757
00:46:03.281 --> 00:46:06.220
to your land of easy wind and downy flight.

758
00:46:07.330 --> 00:46:11.050
<v 0>Oh, you will not be among us in our daily labors after he finishes</v>

759
00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:13.420
just a or stern.

760
00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:16.600
<v 17>I've written the following reply. Dear colleague</v>

761
00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:23.573
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

762
00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:24.881
<v 17>you are generous.</v>

763
00:46:24.881 --> 00:46:28.720
Letter is touched me more than I can say and I will only try to leave you with

764
00:46:28.721 --> 00:46:31.330
some sense of what our common services meant tonight.

765
00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:32.860
He also quotes Robert Frost.

766
00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:37.690
You quoted the poet and I will to in words that set out the ideal of the life

767
00:46:37.691 --> 00:46:41.280
engaged we love and need are one

768
00:46:43.090 --> 00:46:46.480
that phrase accounts for the finest moments of my life on this court.

769
00:46:46.481 --> 00:46:50.560
As we have agreed or continued with each other over those things that matter to

770
00:46:50.561 --> 00:46:55.090
decent people in a civil society. For 19 terms,

771
00:46:55.091 --> 00:46:56.770
I have lived that life with you.

772
00:46:57.580 --> 00:47:02.260
All of us sharing our own best years with one another working side by side his

773
00:47:02.261 --> 00:47:04.140
fellow servants and his friends.

774
00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:09.810
I will not sit with you at our bench again after the court rises for the sum of

775
00:47:09.811 --> 00:47:14.310
this time, but neither will I retire from our friendship,

776
00:47:14.370 --> 00:47:17.880
which has held us together despite the pool of the most passionate dissent.

777
00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:23.790
It just made the work lightest through all my tenure here and for as long as I

778
00:47:23.791 --> 00:47:24.390
live,

779
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:29.290
I will be thankful for it and be under a very grateful obligation to each one of

780
00:47:29.291 --> 00:47:30.124
you.

781
00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:31.780
<v 18>You as affectionate like David</v>

782
00:47:48.810 --> 00:47:49.200
<v 2>[inaudible]. [inaudible]</v>

783
00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:50.060
<v 4>all right, let's be real.</v>

784
00:47:50.061 --> 00:47:53.990
I mean we cannot say for certain why justice Souter retired at that moment.

785
00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:57.570
Justice Souter had said for a long time that he didn't like DC,

786
00:47:57.590 --> 00:48:01.700
that he wanted to have time to hike while he was still vigorous enough to do it.

787
00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:06.140
We also will probably never know exactly why Robert's held the case over for re

788
00:48:06.141 --> 00:48:06.591
argument.

789
00:48:06.591 --> 00:48:11.591
What we do know is in holding the case over that mint suitors inflammatory

790
00:48:11.901 --> 00:48:15.020
bridge burning dissent would never be published.

791
00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:20.710
The Roberts court got to save face and not have this kind of internal fight,

792
00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:22.880
um,

793
00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:27.410
dirty laundry aired and basically avoided the embarrassment that would've come

794
00:48:27.411 --> 00:48:30.680
from the publication of this explosive descent. Okay.

795
00:48:30.681 --> 00:48:32.330
Fast forward a couple of months.

796
00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:36.170
The court reconvenes one more time to hear the case. The room is packed.

797
00:48:36.171 --> 00:48:37.004
Standing Room.

798
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:41.570
<v 18>Well here we argument this morning in case zero eight two oh five citizens</v>

799
00:48:41.571 --> 00:48:45.130
United versus the federal election committed commission.

800
00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:48.760
<v 4>And here's the thing, everybody knew it was going to happen.</v>

801
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:49.501
<v 18>I think.</v>

802
00:48:49.501 --> 00:48:54.501
So you're asking us to have an ongoing chill against speech and there's no place

803
00:48:54.690 --> 00:48:58.110
where an unknowing show was more dangerous than in the elections context.

804
00:48:58.410 --> 00:49:03.410
The government silences a corporate objective and those corporations may have

805
00:49:03.721 --> 00:49:04.800
the most knowledge of this.

806
00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:07.500
Underside preparations have lots of knowledge about environment,

807
00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:11.010
transportation issues and your silings in them. During the election.

808
00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:14.720
<v 4>It'll probably come as no surprise that Kennedy did a whole lot of talking,</v>

809
00:49:14.721 --> 00:49:17.570
a whole lot of carrying on and when the court finally decided the case,

810
00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:21.420
<v 11>we had the landmark decision five to four decision</v>

811
00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:26.090
<v 18>in case zero eight two oh five citizens United vs the FEC.</v>

812
00:49:26.091 --> 00:49:28.010
Justice Kennedy has the opinion of the court,

813
00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:30.200
but if the first amendment has any force,

814
00:49:30.890 --> 00:49:34.670
it prohibits congress from finding or Jaylene citizens or associations of

815
00:49:34.671 --> 00:49:37.640
citizens for simply engaging in political speech.

816
00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:41.570
Political speech is indispensable to decision making in a democracy,

817
00:49:41.571 --> 00:49:45.530
and this is no less true because the speech comes from a corporation rather than

818
00:49:45.531 --> 00:49:48.530
an individual and the government seeks to use its full power,

819
00:49:48.830 --> 00:49:53.270
including the criminal law to command where a person may get his or her

820
00:49:53.271 --> 00:49:57.710
information or what does trust is tours he or she may not hear.

821
00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:02.240
It uses censorship to control thought this is unlawful.

822
00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:05.900
The First Amendment confirms the freedom to think for ourselves.

823
00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:11.290
<v 1>Gosh, no.</v>

824
00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:15.170
Obviously a lot of people were not happy about this decision.

825
00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:18.650
I arrived on behalf of the vast majority of the American people.

826
00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:22.130
You had the kind Newkirk's of the world sneaking in cameras and the court.

827
00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:24.800
You had President Obama at a state of the union last week.

828
00:50:24.801 --> 00:50:28.220
The Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open

829
00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:30.320
<v 23>the flood gates for special interests</v>

830
00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:32.220
<v 3>including foreign corporations.</v>

831
00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:35.910
Basically calling out the justices who were right there in the audience and

832
00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:39.780
without limit in our lucky and they were sitting right in front of them there.

833
00:50:40.330 --> 00:50:44.670
At one point the camera zooms in on Justice Alito just as a Lito appears date at

834
00:50:44.671 --> 00:50:49.500
least crane. He sees remodelings done. [inaudible] Justice Samuel Alito,

835
00:50:49.650 --> 00:50:52.630
<v 23>the grimace thing and mouthing the words. Not True.</v>

836
00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:57.480
<v 0>Speaking of true, here's what's true. The upshot of this decision,</v>

837
00:50:57.481 --> 00:51:00.720
I think most people would agree is that sooner was right, Obama was right.

838
00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:03.000
Suddenly you had a ton more money in politics.

839
00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:06.690
Citizens United has made it possible to raise inordinate amounts of money.

840
00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:10.320
The exact amount of new money that flooded in is a little bit hard to measure,

841
00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:13.100
but what's pretty clear is that all those super packs,

842
00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:16.090
super past super pack is super pack that you hear about. You know,

843
00:51:16.091 --> 00:51:18.480
I've been talking about super packed for almost a year now.

844
00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:21.840
He does things where like an individual can give unlimited amounts of money to

845
00:51:21.841 --> 00:51:23.220
get someone elected or not.

846
00:51:23.250 --> 00:51:27.840
Now what we've got are kind of rogue billionaires putting money into secret

847
00:51:27.841 --> 00:51:28.260
group.

848
00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:31.980
It's safe to say that the citizens United decision basically threw gasoline on

849
00:51:31.981 --> 00:51:35.480
that fire, but before we get ahead of ourselves,

850
00:51:36.110 --> 00:51:38.110
it's not to say that everybody hates this decision. Not ever,

851
00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:42.170
<v 23>but I think people who object to it, uh, I've gone off the deep end.</v>

852
00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:45.680
I think they've lost their minds. I think they're not totally liberals.

853
00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:49.550
<v 0>This is ninth circuit judge Alex Coz Zinsky again, he was the guy in</v>

854
00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:50.530
<v 23>Kennedy's head.</v>

855
00:51:50.530 --> 00:51:55.030
The case stands for the simple proposition that when you band together with

856
00:51:55.031 --> 00:51:57.940
other people, you don't lose your freedom of speech,

857
00:51:58.150 --> 00:52:01.780
whether they be a union or association corporation.

858
00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:05.600
<v 0>You know a lot of, a lot of organizations take the corporate form.</v>

859
00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:07.460
This is Michael Door. Oh my friends call me Mike.

860
00:52:07.461 --> 00:52:09.290
But professionally I more often go by Michael.

861
00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:12.830
He's a professor of law at Cornell, a former Kennedy clerk,

862
00:52:13.070 --> 00:52:15.080
and even though he is critical of the decision,

863
00:52:15.081 --> 00:52:18.350
he says you do need to keep in mind that any opinion itself,

864
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:21.560
Justice Kennedy points out that under the law as it was written,

865
00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:26.980
the ACL EU would be forbidden from putting on its website an essay promoting the

866
00:52:27.951 --> 00:52:30.830
candidacy of a pro free speech candidate.

867
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:36.190
The NAACP couldn't promote a pro civil rights candidate to which you might

868
00:52:36.411 --> 00:52:38.900
argue, well those groups are not for profits.

869
00:52:38.901 --> 00:52:42.320
There should be a difference between not for profits and for profits lot.

870
00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:46.790
The Washington Post is a for profit. CNN is a for profit.

871
00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:50.630
These are core institutions of our democracy.

872
00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:53.090
They're protected not only by freedom of speech, by freedom of the press.

873
00:52:53.690 --> 00:52:54.830
So you say, well, okay,

874
00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:59.060
so we're going to make an exception for media corporations. Well,

875
00:52:59.061 --> 00:53:00.530
what's a media corporation?

876
00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:06.110
Media corporations are often just divisions of other gigantic corporations.

877
00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:11.270
For a while, uh, NBC was a division of General Electric.

878
00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:16.010
Does that mean that you're going to carve up which parts of their funds can go

879
00:53:16.011 --> 00:53:17.810
to the speech rather than to other parts?

880
00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:22.430
And do we really want to trust the government to draw the lines? In other words,

881
00:53:22.431 --> 00:53:26.190
things can get really complicated fast, which is why Ellis Kaczynski says

882
00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:28.170
<v 25>freedom of speech is freedom of speech.</v>

883
00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:31.320
<v 0>Like just don't touch it, keep the government away from it. And he says,</v>

884
00:53:31.321 --> 00:53:33.280
when this citizens United decision came out

885
00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:37.000
<v 25>seemed perfectly right to me. Still seems absolutely correct.</v>

886
00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:41.170
And I think everybody who, uh, all the people who object to it being foolish.

887
00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:45.130
Now, justice Kennedy for his part about two years ago, uh,

888
00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:47.380
he was at Harvard law school. Okay.

889
00:53:47.381 --> 00:53:51.550
There's one over here and having what they call these public conversations with

890
00:53:51.551 --> 00:53:55.060
the Dean when a student, uh, I'm David, I'm a oneL as well.

891
00:53:55.061 --> 00:53:57.670
Thank you for coming to speak to us. Got Up and asked him,

892
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.940
do you regret your decision? Uh, five years later.

893
00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:03.460
I'm curious if you can stand by some of the assumptions that underlied your

894
00:54:03.461 --> 00:54:07.840
opinion there when you see all the money that has poured out of Trump to our

895
00:54:07.841 --> 00:54:12.010
election system. And he said, no, no,

896
00:54:12.011 --> 00:54:13.480
I don't regret the decision.

897
00:54:13.690 --> 00:54:15.990
<v 0>Certainly in my own view. Um,</v>

898
00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:20.050
what happens with money in politics is, is not good,

899
00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:24.400
but it does seem to me one of the things is the disclosure.

900
00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:29.500
<v 25>People don't really have to worry because we have disclosure laws. You know,</v>

901
00:54:29.501 --> 00:54:32.800
when these corporate contributions are being made,

902
00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:38.110
they have to reveal who they are and who their funding sources are.

903
00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:41.920
<v 0>This is something he actually talked about explicitly in his citizens United</v>

904
00:54:41.921 --> 00:54:42.400
decision.

905
00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:46.840
The act has provisions for extensive disclosure and he told the students that

906
00:54:46.841 --> 00:54:49.690
transparency will protect you. It will protect us.

907
00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:51.850
You'll live in this cyber age.

908
00:54:52.330 --> 00:54:55.810
You don't need to wait for three months after the election for a report on who

909
00:54:55.811 --> 00:54:57.790
gave the money. It can be done in 24 hours.

910
00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:01.540
The voters don't like the people who are funding. You don't vote for him.

911
00:55:01.810 --> 00:55:04.630
His point is that if you have the information you need to make a good decision,

912
00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:07.300
nobody's free speech should be limited at all,

913
00:55:07.810 --> 00:55:12.810
and this is frankly a perfect example of the kind of high minded principle that

914
00:55:13.541 --> 00:55:16.840
works in reality. Not at all.

915
00:55:21.130 --> 00:55:21.963
<v 9>No.</v>

916
00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:27.600
<v 16>I mean he's right. There are disclosure laws, but they're really,</v>

917
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:30.330
really easy to get around. For example,

918
00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:35.390
right now I could write a $3 million check to a five oh one C for like citizens

919
00:55:36.721 --> 00:55:41.220
United or the NAACP for that matter, and they would never have to tell anyone

920
00:55:43.610 --> 00:55:46.560
that that money came from me. I could just hide in the shadows.

921
00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:50.610
That's why these kind of donations are often called dark money that owe money.

922
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:55.830
Now there are people who could change this who can make disclosure and actual

923
00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:58.800
meaningful thing. For example,

924
00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:02.013
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

925
00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:03.650
<v 9>[inaudible],</v>

926
00:56:03.650 --> 00:56:05.390
<v 16>the FTC is one of those places</v>

927
00:56:08.030 --> 00:56:08.863
<v 9>[inaudible]</v>

928
00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:14.080
<v 16>the FEC could choose to fix all the loopholes and require that all the money</v>

929
00:56:14.330 --> 00:56:16.280
that is coming to politics in the wake of citizens United,

930
00:56:16.730 --> 00:56:21.260
at the very least be identified, be sourced. The problem is,

931
00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:26.680
is that the FTC is by law to have no more than three commissioners be a member

932
00:56:27.611 --> 00:56:29.200
of the same party at once.

933
00:56:29.201 --> 00:56:32.080
So essentially they want there to be balanced between Democrats,

934
00:56:32.081 --> 00:56:34.480
Republicans and independents. And in this day and age,

935
00:56:34.481 --> 00:56:36.070
what that means is gridlock.

936
00:56:36.250 --> 00:56:40.720
And so the idea of strengthening disclosure laws comes up,

937
00:56:40.721 --> 00:56:44.200
gets stalled, comes up, get stalled, comes up, get stalled, comes up,

938
00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:45.273
get stalled.

939
00:56:45.530 --> 00:56:50.000
<v 0>Couple years ago. Here's a little fun bit of tape. A couple of years ago,</v>

940
00:56:50.001 --> 00:56:54.770
two of the Democratic members on the commission guts so frustrated at the

941
00:56:54.771 --> 00:56:59.120
non-action of this commission that they petition their own commission to allow

942
00:56:59.121 --> 00:57:02.930
for public debate about things like strengthening disclosure.

943
00:57:02.970 --> 00:57:05.820
<v 26>This is the recording of the open meeting of the Federal Election Commission</v>

944
00:57:05.821 --> 00:57:10.110
held on June 18th, 2015 what happened? The petition before us today,

945
00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:15.140
this is commissioner and Ravel is solely to allow people to comment directly to

946
00:57:15.901 --> 00:57:20.901
the commission about issues that are of great importance to everyone in this

947
00:57:21.031 --> 00:57:25.680
country. And rebel is a democrat. She and her colleague Commissioner One, Trump.

948
00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:26.521
Ellen Weintraub.

949
00:57:26.521 --> 00:57:29.430
Thank you chair Rambo brought the petition and as soon as they finished making

950
00:57:29.431 --> 00:57:32.100
their opening statements, Mr Vice Chair. Thank you. Thank you.

951
00:57:32.730 --> 00:57:34.280
Thank you Madam Chair. One of the

952
00:57:34.370 --> 00:57:37.130
<v 0>Republican members of the commission and got by the name of Matthew Peterson</v>

953
00:57:37.460 --> 00:57:41.360
said, okay, so you want to bring a petition, but you know, look,

954
00:57:41.361 --> 00:57:45.800
I'm looking in the rules here and it says that only a quote person can bring a

955
00:57:45.801 --> 00:57:46.420
petition

956
00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:51.420
<v 26>and our definition of person excludes or says does not include the federal</v>

957
00:57:51.491 --> 00:57:54.160
government or any authority of the federal government.

958
00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:58.660
That would seem to indicate that a commissioner acting in his or her official

959
00:57:58.661 --> 00:58:03.610
capacity does not qualify as a person under FTC rules. I mean, first of all,

960
00:58:03.611 --> 00:58:04.430
let me say, I,

961
00:58:04.430 --> 00:58:09.190
I cannot believe that you are actually going to take the position that I am not

962
00:58:09.191 --> 00:58:13.330
a person. I just, I find that a corporation is a person,

963
00:58:13.331 --> 00:58:16.210
but I'm not a person, but we're not in the realm of common sense.

964
00:58:16.211 --> 00:58:19.810
We're in the realm of 11th CFR and I will stipulate that we're not in the realm

965
00:58:19.811 --> 00:58:23.720
of common sense when we were dealing with this book. But it does what it says.

966
00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:27.100
You actually want to insist that I'm not a person. That's right.

967
00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:30.340
That's another FTC, Commissioner Carolina Hunter, Republican. That's right.

968
00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:34.060
That's so bad. It's gotten,

969
00:58:34.061 --> 00:58:38.410
my colleagues will not admit that I'm a person that's really striking because

970
00:58:38.411 --> 00:58:39.820
I'm a member of this commission.

971
00:58:39.850 --> 00:58:44.470
I am not a person is just kind of dumbfounded. I didn't mean literally,

972
00:58:44.471 --> 00:58:47.290
you're not a person. Of course you're person are going to be really does. No,

973
00:58:47.291 --> 00:58:52.170
I think, I think you're not an alien, at least not today. But, um, but uh,

974
00:58:52.590 --> 00:58:54.700
you, I asked the vice chairman yesterday, I said,

975
00:58:54.730 --> 00:58:57.810
are you guys going to have a problem with this? Is it alright?

976
00:58:57.850 --> 00:59:00.940
Could I just finish my, I didn't say anything. I was just going like this.

977
00:59:01.420 --> 00:59:03.130
If you don't, if that bothered you, I'll put my hand down.

978
00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:04.940
I'll call on you next. Thank you.

979
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.930
Can I really do find it comical that you're going to a,

980
00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:10.420
you are so opposed to having,

981
00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:13.530
giving the public this opportunity to weigh in on these issues that you're

982
00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:16.090
willing to take the legal position that were not persons.

983
00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:20.920
I find it comical that um, we got an email from some kids. Something to add.

984
00:59:21.350 --> 00:59:26.090
Well, um, several things. I mean a, you know,

985
00:59:26.091 --> 00:59:30.560
it's, it's ironic, there's a lot of irony on the agenda today,

986
00:59:30.830 --> 00:59:34.010
but as I said, I'm happy to consider new proposals for changes in procedures.

987
00:59:34.011 --> 00:59:37.580
I just don't like to do it on an ad hoc basis. Like the petition.

988
00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:41.930
This meeting is adjourned.

989
00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:48.430
<v 0>And Ravel, uh, one of the two Democrats you just heard who brought the petition,</v>

990
00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:52.870
resigned from the FEC in 2017 she left out of frustration.

991
00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:57.760
And if the FTC is kind of useless when it comes to fixing this whole money and

992
00:59:57.761 --> 01:00:01.540
politics thing, and if the courts have said with the courts, have said, well,

993
01:00:01.541 --> 01:00:05.530
where do we look for hope? The IRS Congress,

994
01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:10.300
I mean, they must be more functional, right, right.
