00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.220
People have been scared of rabies for thousands
of years, many times depicting their fear

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.859
in drawings and carvings of menacing dogs.

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.190
But rabies is scary for more reasons than
just a painful bite.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.230
Because once the virus is inside us, it not
only destroys our body, but damages our mind,

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.580
and it can happen fast, or lay dormant for
years before fatally attacking.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:24.300
So how exactly do we get from a dog bite to
a complete behavioral change to...death?

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.060
The virus that causes rabies is spread through
saliva, so the most common way to contract

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.920
rabies is through an animal bite, most likely from
a dog, bat, raccoon, skunk or fox.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.840
There have been a few, rare cases of transmission
through infected organ donors and an even

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.750
rarer instance of a lab accident, but for
the most part it comes down to a bite from

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.000
a rabid animal.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.800
So even though it’s a virus that can infect
and kill humans, it’s studied considerably

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.890
in veterinary labs.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:50.890
OK.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.470
I am Dr. Susan Moore.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.460
I'm the laboratory director of the rabies
laboratory at Kansas State University, part

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.240
of the veterinary diagnostic lab within the
vet school here.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.160
We are the largest rabies serology laboratory
in the world.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.460
So the rabies virus is in the family lyssavirus,

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.200
lyssa means rage really.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.520
So that kind of tells you what this group
of viruses are capable of.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.420
And what they’re capable of is causing a
very quick and painful death caused by the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.300
virus making its way into your brain.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.750
It's a neurotropic virus.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.409
So that means it's preferentially going
to infect neural tissue or neural cells.

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:36.070
So when it gets injected into the skin or
the muscle, it's not going to replicate all

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.330
that well but all it needs to do is replicate
enough that it can get to that neuromuscular

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:47.060
junction where that it can go from the muscle
cells into the central nervous system.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.520
Now, at this point you’d think your immune
system would kick in, recognize this dangerous

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.090
intruder and destroy it.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.479
But, your immune system doesn’t see it.

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.680
This is thought to be because the virus replicates
slowly in the muscle tissue, slow enough

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.010
not to cause any alarm.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.380
This gives it a chance to reach the nervous
system, where it hitches a ride up to the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.700
brain and slips through the blood brain barrier.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.440
It’s behind this shield where the rabies
virus can flourish while still being able

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.850
to hide from our immune system, because the
blood brain barrier evolved to keep dangerous

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.060
or harmful things out.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.400
But sometimes that includes immune cells.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.450
In fact, if T cells do get past the blood
brain barrier, the rabies virus has evasion

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.140
techniques where it actually kills the T cells
that are coming in.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.290
As the virus replicates in the brain, it starts
to mess with the brain’s cellular proteins,

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.069
causing neural dysfunction.

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.410
This is where certain symptoms of rabies start
and how you can tell the infection has fully

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.410
set in.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:44.160
Once the infection has fully set in, it will
start traveling back out through the nerves

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.709
into innervated organs,

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.500
hair follicles.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.819
But again, particularly through to the salivary
glands.

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.860
So that it could be transmitted out.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.910
These neurological symptoms also help the
virus transfer to a new host.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.280
Hypersalivation ensures there is enough rabies-infected saliva in the optimal transmission location, your mouth.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.840
And hydrophobia, or
trouble swallowing, ensures that it stays there.

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.410
In animals, the aggression can result in an
attack on another animal or a human.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.959
Put all three of those together and you have
a very effective way to ensure the rabies

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.460
virus is passed on.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:23.760
Saliva is the way that rabies is transmitted.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.709
The way the virus is adapted, it is not in
blood.

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.300
It's not in body fluids.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:37.250
So it has to find a way to be transmitted
effectively, right, to perpetuate its existence.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.209
Now, this neurological damage caused by the
infection is the thing that finally tips off

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:42.209
the immune system.

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.920
However, at this point it’s too late.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.099
Even though your immune system is finally
going after the virus, it has already spread

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:49.349
throughout the body.

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.680
After that you have to remember this period
is pretty short.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.490
There's just a couple days because then it'll
progress into a coma and then death which

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.050
is usually due to some kind of organ failure.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.080
But a bite from a rabid animal doesn’t always
mean certain death.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.860
People who have been exposed to the rabies
virus can get a series of shots that can boost

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.340
the immune system and fight off the virus,
you just need to get to it before it reaches the brain.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.180
So surviving rabies is all about timing and
the location where you get bit.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.180
Where you get bit.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.060
It plays a big role.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:29.540
So since the virus has to travel through the
nerve system, the closer, and get to the brain,

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.590
the closer that bite is to the brain, the
better for the virus.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:39.759
Bats are a danger for that reason
that it's going to be biting probably around

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:46.520
your head or your hands. But also you don't
notice a bat bite because the teeth are so small

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.460
and they are so small.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.840
Maybe.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.300
You have a bat on your shoulder and you don't
know it.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.880
You just looked on your shoulder, didn't you?
