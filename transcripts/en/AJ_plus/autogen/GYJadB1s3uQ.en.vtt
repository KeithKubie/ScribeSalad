00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.300
 we came here to watch 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.610
 on how is the protest in America 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:18.240
 we are interested in the protest movement on 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.980
 to the whole world if we know that somewhere this 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.519
 happens and we find ourselves there of course 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.980
 can not keep out and particular today 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.199
 Russia was also a big process not 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.179
 can you 30,000 people against the war 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.920
 Ukraine when it was a peace march 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.770
 organized by our friends and 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.980
 propaganda filed everything in such a way that 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:43.620
 give them came but actively followed 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.930
 so what happens there and passed came 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.110
 a very large number of people we are happy 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.969
 that they have succeeded and so are we 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.710
 glad to see a peaceful protest here 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:59.370
 without falling down the police as it happens with us 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.600
 In Russia, for example, I hope that this is the case. 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.600
 will continue until 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.000
