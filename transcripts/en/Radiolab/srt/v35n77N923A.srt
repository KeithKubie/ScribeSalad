1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,990
Let's just start it from the
top. Okay. You Ready? All right.

2
00:00:03,991 --> 00:00:07,680
So for reporter Sheri Fink who works at
the New York Times and is author of the

3
00:00:07,681 --> 00:00:12,000
book five days at Memorial, you could
say it all began with two tents.

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,090
So this was back in 1999

5
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:19,880
[inaudible]

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,830
the u s and other,

7
00:00:21,831 --> 00:00:26,600
I think NATO allies were involved
in a bombing campaign in Serbia.

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,860
This is basically like last gasps of
[inaudible] war in the former Yugoslavia.

9
00:00:32,861 --> 00:00:36,010
You had Serbia attacking
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.

10
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,710
NATO was trying to protect
them, bombing Serbia,

11
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:42,640
which was creating a huge
exodus of refugees. Now,

12
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,090
Sherry at the time was not
yet fully or reporters.

13
00:00:46,091 --> 00:00:48,280
She was fresh out of med school,

14
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:52,630
volunteering at a human rights
organization working on a book about a war

15
00:00:52,631 --> 00:00:55,540
hospital in Bosnia. And
since she knew the landscape,

16
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,950
she was able to convince this
organization to let her go to Macedonia to

17
00:00:59,951 --> 00:01:03,910
document what was happening to
document potential war crimes.

18
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:08,970
So I remember I went to the border of
Kosovo and Macedonia and like 100,000

19
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,060
refugees had shown up.

20
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:18,500
They were trying to cross
the border into Macedonia.

21
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,520
But the Macedonian government had
closed its border with Kosovo,

22
00:01:22,521 --> 00:01:25,040
so people who were fleeing got trapped.

23
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,360
They got stuck in this muddy no
man's land between the two borders.

24
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,620
She said police and Rike your were
basically lining the Macedonian side.

25
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,920
So you had all of these people crammed
into this muddy channel and the

26
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:45,820
Macedonian Red Cross and this one
charity had gotten permission to set up a

27
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,820
makeshift medical station
in that border area.

28
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:55,850
Between these two countries, there's
a sort of frumpy brown medical tent.

29
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,680
Now Sheri was there to conduct
interviews, nothing to do with medicine.

30
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:04,460
I was there to collect
information, but when I got there,

31
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:10,810
I literally remember walking up to
this border and a doctor who I had

32
00:02:10,971 --> 00:02:12,110
interviewed previously,

33
00:02:12,111 --> 00:02:17,111
this really tall Albanian Kosovo Albanian
doctor looked out and he told the

34
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:22,470
Macedonian border guard, let her
in. We need her. She's a doctor.

35
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,480
They just grabbed you and pulled
you into this tent? Yes. What?

36
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,170
So you're just out of med
school? When this happened,

37
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,210
I had just finished med school. Yeah.

38
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:34,200
Suddenly she says she was tossed in with
all these war doctors and here's the

39
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:37,980
key. Eventually she gets
posted at the door of the tent.

40
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,720
And what I ended up doing,

41
00:02:39,721 --> 00:02:43,290
or what they put me in
charge of was triage.

42
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,150
No [inaudible]. It's a, it's a French
word. Nice. Excellent. Yes, thank you.

43
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,810
Ah, it means to sort
or to sort for quality.

44
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,720
Originally it was a reference
to sorting coffee beans,

45
00:02:57,721 --> 00:02:59,590
actually sorting
different kinds of coffee.

46
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,510
But a few hundred years ago,

47
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:05,710
the word started being applied to people
to actually sorting different kinds of

48
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:09,610
casualties on the battlefield.
And that suddenly was her job.

49
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,440
Literally, I stood outside of this

50
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,410
makeshift medical
station and every minute,

51
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,850
every couple of minutes there would be
another patient brought to the door of

52
00:03:22,851 --> 00:03:23,930
our medical tent.

53
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:29,020
And so my job was to stand outside that
door and decide who gets in and who

54
00:03:29,901 --> 00:03:34,400
doesn't. Like how did you do that?
How did you make that choice? Well,

55
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,300
I don't remember having guidelines.
I remember just having to wing it.

56
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,400
She says she just went on instinct.

57
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:45,080
And so the people who seemed like they
might be having a heart attack or a

58
00:03:45,081 --> 00:03:49,040
seizure, those were the ones who
went into that tent. But you know,

59
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:52,970
people with physical disabilities, no
people who have chronic conditions,

60
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:58,040
no psychiatric issues,
nope. Everybody else.

61
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:03,100
I had to direct to this other tent and
someone ended up calling it the tent of

62
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:06,044
the damned

63
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:08,990
[inaudible].

64
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:13,100
I remember appealing for help from
the Macedonian Health Ministry saying,

65
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:17,030
you know, take these people into
Macedonia. They're not a threat. Um,

66
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,340
open your board or take
them in. They need care.

67
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,280
And the health ministry kept refusing.

68
00:04:22,281 --> 00:04:24,890
And so they stayed in
this tent day after day.

69
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:27,340
[inaudible]

70
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,340
sometimes for four, five, six days.

71
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:35,200
And several of the people
in this tent, they died.

72
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,730
Cherry says this experience haunted her.

73
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:45,230
And years later when she was a full blown
reporter and traveling all around the

74
00:04:45,231 --> 00:04:47,420
world, looking at triage
and different scenarios,

75
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,780
she would return to this memory
again and again. And wonder,

76
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,600
how do people in that situation
make that decision? How should they

77
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,630
today a collaboration
with the New York Times?

78
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:06,160
We're gonna follow reporter Sherry think
through the INS and outs of triaged in

79
00:05:06,161 --> 00:05:08,050
three different situations,

80
00:05:08,051 --> 00:05:12,940
three different places in the world as
she tries to understand what it means to

81
00:05:12,941 --> 00:05:17,590
play God. I'm Jad Abumrad
I'm Robert Krulwich.

82
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,110
This is Radiolab. Stay with us.

83
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,283
[inaudible]

84
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,700
are we rolling? Yeah. Okay,
thank you. It's going to get, oh,

85
00:05:43,701 --> 00:05:44,930
he's gonna get some water. Okay.

86
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,030
By the way, we know we're
going to start with Kosovo.

87
00:05:50,031 --> 00:05:54,300
When did you as a writer become obsessed
with all of this? Well, well this,

88
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,373
this,

89
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,440
this obsession of about triage came
about when I was working on my last book

90
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,450
[inaudible] five days at Memorial,
which was about triage in a,

91
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,480
an emergency in Hurricane Katrina.

92
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,030
This is the scenario that people in
New Orleans had been fearing for a long

93
00:06:14,031 --> 00:06:18,050
time. A category five hurricane
headed right toward the city. Okay,

94
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:19,280
so this is going to be a first stop.

95
00:06:19,281 --> 00:06:24,050
We all in New Orleans have heard the
story of Katrina told and retold. Um,

96
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,290
certainly it's hard not to think about
now with what's happening in baton rouge,

97
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:32,510
but in this story, the hurricane
is really just a backdrop really.

98
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:34,520
We're going to focus in on one building.

99
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:40,420
This Hospital Memorial Medical Center
built in 1926 in one of the lowest parts

100
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:45,230
of that city, which is really like a
bowl. It was a sturdy brick building,

101
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,250
eight stories tall,

102
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:51,110
stretching over two city blocks that had
served in every storm until that point.

103
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:53,150
It was really seen as somewhere safe.

104
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,780
[inaudible] I don't want to leave. Merriam

105
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,550
and this hospital became for Sherry,

106
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:05,300
a kind of portal into these
questions about triage.

107
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,360
She ended up spending six and a half years
interviewing doctors at the hospital,

108
00:07:10,551 --> 00:07:14,330
patients, nurses, family members,
government officials, ethicists,

109
00:07:14,331 --> 00:07:16,340
hospital administrators in all.

110
00:07:16,341 --> 00:07:21,341
She conducted over 500
interviews to reconstruct
moment for moment what happened

111
00:07:21,351 --> 00:07:23,570
at the hospital during Hurricane Katrina

112
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:27,790
[inaudible]

113
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,371
get ready.

114
00:07:28,371 --> 00:07:31,670
This is the most intense part of the
storm is getting ready to come across

115
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:35,900
day one, Monday, August
29th, 2005 around 6:00 AM

116
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,613
Katrina Harris.

117
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:46,950
I've never seen anything in my
life like this and all that.

118
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,310
They get it

119
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:55,160
through the storm. Okay,
the city power's gone,

120
00:07:55,161 --> 00:07:58,100
but they've got their backup
power. But this hospital,

121
00:07:58,101 --> 00:08:01,010
it had a vulnerability a lot
of American hospitals have,

122
00:08:01,011 --> 00:08:05,270
which is that they had
moved the generators to the
second floor so that they

123
00:08:05,271 --> 00:08:10,250
would be higher up in case of flooding.
But electricity is all about circuits.

124
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:14,480
And they had elements of that backup
power system that were below flood level,

125
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,840
things like switches and
other electrical material,

126
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,090
but they got through the first day. Okay.

127
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,710
And it seemed at that point that
the worst was over. And then

128
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:29,360
you have heard about that water coming
over that no. When did the song rise up?

129
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:32,020
Actually, after the coal made
it clear though the levies

130
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:38,230
water surrounds this hospital,
it fills New Orleans,

131
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,860
and as the water started to
rise around the hospital,

132
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:46,930
that is the moment that the people in
charge knew they were in big, big trouble.

133
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,670
They knew what their vulnerability was.

134
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:57,210
How many patients were in the hospital
at this point? There 250 patients.

135
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:02,550
There are about 2000 people because you
had so many wow staff and then all the

136
00:09:02,551 --> 00:09:06,270
visitors who had come with the
staff members and with the patients.

137
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,110
So Sherry says mid morning on
that second day, this is Tuesday,

138
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:13,260
August 30th just as the
waters were starting to rise,

139
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:18,330
a group of doctors got together and they
did come up with a system which evolved

140
00:09:18,331 --> 00:09:19,680
a little bit over the crisis,

141
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:23,990
but they decided first get the babies out,

142
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,060
get the critical care patients out,

143
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:31,010
and they knew that they had two high
water trucks from the national guard and

144
00:09:31,011 --> 00:09:32,780
the water wasn't so, so high yet.

145
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:37,490
At that point it was only partway up
the sloping emergency room ramp and they

146
00:09:37,491 --> 00:09:41,120
decided to put patients who
could walk on those trucks. So

147
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:43,570
[inaudible]

148
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,250
helicopter start to arrive.

149
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:48,310
A medical staff start to bundle
tiny babies in incubators,

150
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,450
ICU patients in wheelchairs onto the
elevator and up to the hell a pet.

151
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,660
How many patients can a
single helicopter take? Yeah,

152
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:58,840
like the ones that were landing, how
many can they do? One or two. Wow.

153
00:09:58,841 --> 00:10:00,880
So this is slow going. Yeah,

154
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:06,010
it was late evening before they got all
the intensive care unit patients out and

155
00:10:06,011 --> 00:10:08,680
they get all the babies and
they get all the babies. All in,

156
00:10:08,681 --> 00:10:09,491
all in that second day,

157
00:10:09,491 --> 00:10:13,720
they evacuated about 60 people that
are 60 of the most critical patients.

158
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:19,420
Although we should also say that
if a patient had signed a DNR,

159
00:10:19,421 --> 00:10:20,890
a do not resuscitate order,

160
00:10:20,891 --> 00:10:25,240
the doctors decided those patients should
not go first and they were held back.

161
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:30,990
And we'll sort of explain their
thinking on that in just a second. Okay.

162
00:10:30,991 --> 00:10:34,470
So darkness falls on day two. The
doctors and nurses are exhausted.

163
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,070
They'd been working really, really
hard carrying patients in the heat.

164
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:43,020
Many of them lay down on cots and
vacant beds to rest for the night.

165
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,550
And then

166
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,150
before the sunrises, few hours before

167
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:56,030
about 2:00 AM the buzz of
the generators suddenly just

168
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,130
stopped. It's quiet.

169
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:06,710
The water had reached those electrical
switches in the basement. Dr Dr. Cook,

170
00:11:06,711 --> 00:11:09,110
Ewing Cook, a longtime ICU doctor.

171
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:13,880
He was lying not far from where those
generators were. And he said to me,

172
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:18,630
it was quote, the sickest sound
of his life found absence. Yeah.

173
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:23,180
And that is when it became
an absolute emergency.

174
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:24,014
In this hospital.

175
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,540
It's pitch blackness. Some
of the medical equipment,

176
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,920
if they have backup batteries,

177
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:34,270
they started beeping to warn that
the electrical power had stopped.

178
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:39,070
You still had nine patients who
relied on ventilators to breathe.

179
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:43,060
It became a hive of activity,
I think gotta get everyone out.

180
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,880
Everybody was running
around with flashlights.

181
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:51,030
These beams in the blackness
trying desperately to move
those patients down the

182
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:55,150
stairs. Now there's elevators.
That's the other big thing.

183
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:00,370
Fortunately somebody found a hole in the
machine room wall on the second floor

184
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,070
that led directly to a parking garage,

185
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,690
and so they figured out they can pass
patients through this roughly three by

186
00:12:07,691 --> 00:12:10,870
three foot hole onto the
back of a pickup truck,

187
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:16,020
drive them up to the eighth story of that
parking garage and then carry them up.

188
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:21,070
Three rickety flights of steps
to this formerly unused helipad

189
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:28,670
and five of the nine patients
on ventilators died just right.

190
00:12:29,101 --> 00:12:29,934
Then.

191
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,040
It's just like I said, I've been
trying to put it away. Yeah,

192
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:38,390
but I want to make this as
accurate as I can for you.

193
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,730
This is tape of an interview that Sherry
did back in 2008 when she was doing

194
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,960
research for this story.

195
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:48,300
Okay, good. Introduce yourself. My
name is gene is bell is bell. Okay.

196
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,500
Just like it's spelled.

197
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,540
Gina was a nursing director working on
the seventh floor of the hospital that

198
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:54,630
day.

199
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:57,990
She'd actually been attending to those
nine patients that didn't make the first

200
00:12:57,991 --> 00:12:58,824
helicopter run.

201
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:03,210
And she described to Sherry that right
after the power went out and after the

202
00:13:03,211 --> 00:13:05,790
ventilators shut down, one
of her patients flatlined.

203
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:10,650
And um, we brought him back.
We had run out of oxygen.

204
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:14,490
Oh, hospital. That's what she'd
been told. And he needed oxygen.

205
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:21,110
And so we brought him down the
stairs to the second floor.

206
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:25,620
They brought him down in the dark and
then got in line to wait for their turn to

207
00:13:25,621 --> 00:13:28,980
go through the hole in the
wall up to the heliport window.

208
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,040
And she says that since his
ventilator wasn't working anymore,

209
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,720
the whole time they were standing there,

210
00:13:33,721 --> 00:13:38,721
they had the hand squeeze this ventilator
bag to keep air going into his lungs.

211
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,830
You know, he kept twitching
and I knew he needed oxygen.

212
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:46,300
And so I was in line and it
was my turn at the window.

213
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:51,910
I kept bagging him and bagging him. One
of the physicians came over and said,

214
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:56,800
you do know that he needs the
oxygen? I said, yes sir. He said,

215
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,030
we don't have any oxygen can,

216
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:03,580
we can't get any and
you have to let him go.

217
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:10,000
And at that point, you know,

218
00:14:10,001 --> 00:14:14,730
I'm standing there and I'm
like, how do you do this?

219
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,720
Heidi did just let him go.

220
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,240
But he was right. I mean,

221
00:14:22,241 --> 00:14:27,241
I knew what were neurological and that
he needed oxygen and he wasn't gonna make

222
00:14:27,311 --> 00:14:28,144
it without it.

223
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:34,140
So I just hugged him and his hair and

224
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,060
I waited and just kinda held him

225
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:44,300
and he died in my arms. And, um, you know,

226
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,490
you're not prepared for that.

227
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,570
I had to take out of the bar, the room

228
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:55,850
[inaudible]

229
00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:00,850
so I rolled them out and the morgue was
full and the chaplain came over to me

230
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,900
and he says, come on with me.

231
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:10,530
And we took the body into the
chapel and I just did the,

232
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:15,760
and I just bust out crying and
he just held me and we prayed.

233
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:19,850
And um, why did he laugh?

234
00:15:19,851 --> 00:15:22,070
I just sat the chapel for a few minutes

235
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,653
and uh,

236
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,300
try to compose myself a little bit,

237
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,250
be prepared to help people
and to save people. You know,

238
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,630
it's just not enough.

239
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,590
Everything you've done is just not enough.

240
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:52,550
Day three, Wednesday, August 31st,

241
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:57,550
2005 sunrises and that's when they're
expecting all the helicopters come back

242
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:06,130
and they wait and they wait and they
wait and an occasional helicopter comes.

243
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:13,900
But this concerted rescue effort that
had taken place the evening before has

244
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:18,370
stopped. Now we know now looking back

245
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:24,000
on that Wednesday, the helicopters were
doing their own triage coast coastguard,

246
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:28,350
rescuing people and looking at
people on rooftops waving rags.

247
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,540
It's higher family is on that roof, right?

248
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,830
[inaudible] but the people
inside the hospital,

249
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,710
most of them had no idea.

250
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:42,860
All they knew was we're in
this horrific situation.

251
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,990
Where are the helicopters at this point?

252
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:50,670
There's still nearly 200 patients at
the hospital. And some of the staff,

253
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:55,350
they're panicked because it takes them
so long to move the patients to the top

254
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,990
of the parking garage just
below that hell a pad,

255
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:00,930
so she says on that third day
at about seven in the morning,

256
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:05,070
a bunch of doctors and
hospital administrators, maybe
a dozen, dozen and a half.

257
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,160
They got together and they
decided that they needed a system,

258
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,910
a way of organizing their patients so
that when those helicopters started to

259
00:17:11,911 --> 00:17:14,550
show up again, they wouldn't
waste any time at all.

260
00:17:14,551 --> 00:17:18,200
They'd know exactly who to evacuate
in what order. In other words,

261
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,000
who are we going to get out first?

262
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:26,250
That was the question and that's the
moment where they come up with the ones,

263
00:17:26,251 --> 00:17:30,920
twos and threes. This is triage.

264
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,620
There are limited number
of resources in this case,

265
00:17:33,621 --> 00:17:38,300
helicopters and a few boats and we have
to decide which people get access to

266
00:17:38,301 --> 00:17:39,230
those resources.

267
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:45,020
There are a couple of ways
to look at this. Sherry says,

268
00:17:45,021 --> 00:17:48,700
if you go back to the very beginning
of triage, the first conception of it,

269
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,460
1790s Napoleon's

270
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,860
chief surgeon baron, Larry,

271
00:17:52,861 --> 00:17:57,270
I think you made a rule on the battlefield
that you'd take the people who are in

272
00:17:57,271 --> 00:17:58,830
the acute need first.

273
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:02,400
So the sickest are going to be treated
first and with the most resources,

274
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,820
and this is the way it works
in most emergency rooms,

275
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:10,140
there's a long waiting line of fevers
and cuts, but if you got a heart attack,

276
00:18:10,141 --> 00:18:11,760
you get right to the front of the line.

277
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:16,260
Another way to look at it
is the utilitarian concept.

278
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:19,590
It's got to start with some philosophers
in the 18th and 19th centuries.

279
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:23,040
The core of this idea seems simple,
try to do the greatest good.

280
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:28,020
You want to maximize some sort of
good outcome amongst a population.

281
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,140
So rather than think about what
one individual needs, you think,

282
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:36,150
how can I save the most number of lives
or the most number of years of life?

283
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,930
If we want to maximize years of life,
we might want to pick people who are,

284
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,690
have a better chance of
surviving or younger people.

285
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:47,370
And this method of triage is what you
often see in a war zone where say there's

286
00:18:47,371 --> 00:18:52,170
a bombing and you have more
injured victims than there
are ambulances or medics.

287
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,830
So one, two, three.

288
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:01,960
Imagine a lobby area in a hospital
waiting area. Sherri says, in this case,

289
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,770
what the doctors did. They ask the staff
to get everyone out of their rooms,

290
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:09,250
bring them down to that second
floor lobby, and then some doctors,

291
00:19:09,251 --> 00:19:13,600
including one whose name might be
relevant for later, Dr Anna Poe,

292
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,750
she was a head and neck
surgeon, she and another doctor,

293
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:21,790
they stationed themselves on the landing
where the patients were brought down to

294
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:24,910
on that second floor. And as
the nurses would bring them,

295
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:28,180
they would look quickly
at the patient's chart,

296
00:19:28,181 --> 00:19:30,100
look at the patient
and decide on a number.

297
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,580
And the nurses would take a magic marker
and a piece of paper and write either

298
00:19:33,581 --> 00:19:35,470
one, two or three on that paper.

299
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:38,990
And then she says they would tape
that number onto the patient's gown.

300
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:42,980
So the ones where you're
relatively healthy, patients,

301
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,400
patient maybe who had an
appendicitis and their appendix out,

302
00:19:46,401 --> 00:19:48,800
but they're looking good.
They could even be discharged.

303
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,050
The ones would be rescued by boat.

304
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:56,080
Presumably among the first the twos were
your more typical hospital patients.

305
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:00,260
Patient may be who had a heart
attack, who wasn't fully recovered,

306
00:20:00,261 --> 00:20:05,000
who would need ongoing care.
They would go by helicopter,

307
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,020
presumably second,

308
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,130
and then the threes were those super
sick patients or anyone with a do not

309
00:20:10,131 --> 00:20:15,080
resuscitate order. Those patients would
go last one of the doctors when I said,

310
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:19,850
why did you choose the sickest patients
to go last? One of them said, well,

311
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:24,851
I figured anyone with the do not
resuscitate order would have a terminal or

312
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:30,160
irreversible condition, which by the
way isn't always the case. And he said,

313
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:34,660
I thought that that patient would
have quote the least to lose.

314
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:38,970
So it sounds like in some way they
went to more of a utilitarian way of

315
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,230
thinking. Yeah.

316
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:45,680
And you could see everything that
follows as flowing from that utilitarian

317
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:46,501
decision.

318
00:20:46,501 --> 00:20:50,200
And actually they it a few different
points to prioritize the healthiest people

319
00:20:50,201 --> 00:20:52,570
first. And the sickest people last,

320
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:56,540
his choices ultimately did become, um,

321
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,240
very consequential. In any case,

322
00:20:59,241 --> 00:21:02,480
all three groups were placed in different
parts of the hospital and the threes

323
00:21:02,481 --> 00:21:06,490
were kept in the lobby. The second
floor lobby [inaudible] just

324
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:11,900
way too

325
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:20,910
[inaudible].

326
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:25,410
So as the day goes on the area started
to get really full patient next to

327
00:21:25,411 --> 00:21:29,610
patient on these cots in one corner she
says you had about 18 people lined up

328
00:21:29,611 --> 00:21:33,870
side by side and these were people with
heart conditions, symptoms of pneumonia,

329
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:38,580
stroke. There were nurses standing
around fanning people. It just,

330
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,070
it was so, so hot.

331
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:45,750
Some people guessed that the temperature
inside the building must have been a

332
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:45,870
hundred degrees.

333
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:50,870
I don't know if there's any way for me
to describe to you how intense the heat

334
00:21:50,881 --> 00:21:54,540
was. This is Dr Anna [inaudible]
in an interview with 60 minutes.

335
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:57,600
She was one of the doctors who did
the numbering. It was relentless.

336
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:03,110
It was suffocating and made it extremely
difficult to breathe and with the heat

337
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:07,250
came the terrible smell. It's
just started to smell really good,

338
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,130
bad enough. The bathrooms were so bad.

339
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:14,510
That's Gina Isbell again, she said sewage
was sort of backing up in the toilet.

340
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:19,350
I mean they just had to word
everywhere on the ground everywhere.

341
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,750
You just personally,

342
00:22:21,751 --> 00:22:24,570
I didn't want to eat or drink anything
cause I didn't want to have to use the

343
00:22:24,571 --> 00:22:25,404
bathroom.

344
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,510
As the day went on, some people
started really feeling abandoned.

345
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:35,690
Why aren't they here? Why
aren't they helping us?

346
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,850
We're in a war zone here.
It looks like a war zone.

347
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:45,410
On the seventh floor there was this radio
that was playing in the corridors past

348
00:22:45,411 --> 00:22:50,411
six o'clock here on welcome to the local
talk station and the radio was this

349
00:22:50,751 --> 00:22:51,740
radio station.

350
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,560
One of the only ways they were
getting information from the outside,

351
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:57,860
the mindset, the needs,
the hunger, the anger,

352
00:22:57,861 --> 00:23:02,480
the rage is growing among some of the
nurses have carts that they would roll

353
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:05,780
around and they'd have the little radio
on the cart and they'd be listening.

354
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,010
Basic jungle.

355
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:12,100
Human instincts are beginning to creep
in and there were tales on the radio that

356
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:13,440
were alarming. The staff,

357
00:23:13,441 --> 00:23:18,110
someone is breaking into businesses and
alluding merchandise and these people

358
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:21,500
should be shot. Things that turned
out not to be true, like you know,

359
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:25,070
run a martial law here that
they had declared martial law.

360
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:30,740
There was literally a deputy sheriff who
got on air and told people that we even

361
00:23:30,741 --> 00:23:33,050
both commented said out, it
looked like a shark's fin.

362
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:37,670
He saw a shark swimming around a
hotel. They're walking like zombies,

363
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:40,610
like nights of the living
dead. That'll just imagine, oh,

364
00:23:40,611 --> 00:23:43,790
that would feel if you were
in this hospital and that
was the only word you were

365
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:46,090
having about what going on outside.

366
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,570
One of our employees was like having a
breakdown freaking out in the garage.

367
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,620
By the afternoon of that
third day, that Wednesday,

368
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:57,040
some of the staff are having nervous
breakdowns. Morale is really,

369
00:23:57,041 --> 00:24:00,580
really low because all these
patients are still there. Basically

370
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,260
patients was so hot, you know,

371
00:24:02,261 --> 00:24:05,950
they would just kind of drift off to sleep
and you have to wake them up and make

372
00:24:05,951 --> 00:24:10,720
them take sips of water, sips
of 'em, whatever. We had,

373
00:24:10,721 --> 00:24:11,554
you know,

374
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:16,490
city of New Orleans one day
I'm Amanda's Bay, Hello Guy.

375
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:20,900
One of the nurses told me she was worried
that there could be brain or lasting

376
00:24:20,901 --> 00:24:23,780
effects of this severe overheating

377
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:27,620
[inaudible]

378
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,410
so there's this level of, of panic.

379
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,310
What happened? Well,

380
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,360
so there is also the
situation of the pets,

381
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,600
and this may make no sense to most people,

382
00:24:41,601 --> 00:24:44,030
but they would offer staff members,

383
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:48,260
they could bring their pets if they
were coming in to work a storm and they

384
00:24:48,261 --> 00:24:53,261
turned medical records over into a Kennel
and people start to worry about their

385
00:24:53,411 --> 00:24:55,330
pets. Apparently on that Wednesday,

386
00:24:55,331 --> 00:24:59,080
one of the larger dogs in Newfoundland
started having seizures from the heat.

387
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:04,260
So some of the staff chose to
have doctors euthanize their pets

388
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,870
and then just

389
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:11,500
try to imagine if you can,
looters are running free.

390
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:16,180
It's trying to shatter windows and
climate in the stores. It's hot.

391
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:19,270
People are dying. You're hearing gunshots
in the neighborhood, you're afraid.

392
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:20,770
Just total chaos.

393
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:23,710
You don't know if there's real
violence breaking out in the city.

394
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:26,380
There are bodies floating
in the water there.

395
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:29,680
You don't know how many rescue resources
are going to come. It's nighttime.

396
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,350
And your colleague walks up
to you and says, you know,

397
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:38,850
we're euthanizing the pets to
put them out of their misery.

398
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,090
What about these suffering patients?

399
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:46,290
Shouldn't we put some of
them out of their misery

400
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,050
and I interviewed all these people and
trying to figure out like where did this

401
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:56,640
idea come from and tracing it back and
there were all these little informal

402
00:25:56,641 --> 00:25:57,690
conversations

403
00:25:59,440 --> 00:25:59,820
[inaudible]

404
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:04,500
and this starts just going
around the hospital. This,

405
00:26:04,501 --> 00:26:08,790
this sort of idea of putting
patients out of their misery.

406
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:12,520
I don't know who told me
that, but that's what I heard.

407
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,060
And you know, in those circumstances,

408
00:26:16,061 --> 00:26:21,061
what do you do if you're at war and
you have someone that's not going to be

409
00:26:21,791 --> 00:26:26,290
picked up and you can't carry them to
safety and they're bleeding to death,

410
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:32,080
what did he do? Yell at
himself off to yell at him.

411
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,593
I don't know.

412
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,650
Jerry says that as this idea
spread around the hospital,

413
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,300
people fell into different camps.

414
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,420
Some people thought this was the
most humane thing they could do.

415
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,660
It would be criminal to
let people suffer more.

416
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:53,160
Other people when they heard about
it were outraged. For example,

417
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:58,800
Dr. Bryant King, whose colleague, Dr
Fournier, she walks up to him and says,

418
00:26:58,801 --> 00:27:02,940
there's this discussion going on and you
know, what do you think? And he says,

419
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:06,080
dude, you gotta be kidding me to to
actually think that that's a good idea.

420
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:09,130
This is Dr. King in an interview on CNN,

421
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,860
how could you possibly think
that that's a good idea?

422
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:15,403
[inaudible]

423
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:22,440
day four, Thursday, September 1st,
here's what ends up happening.

424
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:26,460
And accounts here are a
bit vague and in dispute,

425
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:31,450
but according to Dr. King who
spoke about this on CNN, he says,

426
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:34,210
and other people say they
saw this as well. He says,

427
00:27:34,211 --> 00:27:37,270
he saw one of the doctors we
talked about earlier, Dr Anna Poe,

428
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,970
who is still there that Thursday
morning caring for patients.

429
00:27:39,971 --> 00:27:43,420
These patients on the second
floor who were chosen to go last.

430
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:48,340
He says he saw her talking to patients
while holding a handful of syringes.

431
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:53,410
Anna standing over there with a handful
of syringes talking to a patient and the

432
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,190
words that I heard her say,

433
00:27:55,191 --> 00:27:58,490
where I'm going to give you something
to make you feel better. Nice.

434
00:27:58,491 --> 00:28:02,450
He had a handful of syringes,
I don't, and nobody,

435
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:05,870
nobody walks around with a handful of
the ranges and goes and gives the same

436
00:28:05,871 --> 00:28:07,610
thing, these patients that
that's just not how we do it.

437
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,930
Did you afford for a beat?

438
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,260
After this whole ordeal was over and
the rescue teams in the mortuary teams

439
00:28:15,261 --> 00:28:17,960
arrived, many bodies were
found in this hospital,

440
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:23,360
about 45 bodies found. And so there
was an investigation launched.

441
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:27,410
They found these bodies, they
tested these bodies for drugs.

442
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:32,800
And what they found was that nearly
two dozen patients had received either

443
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:35,030
morphine or verse,

444
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:40,420
said a powerful sedative or a combination
of the two in a very short time period

445
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,930
on that Thursday, September
1st, 2005. So again,

446
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:47,300
how many it was I think 21 in the end.

447
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,510
But it's complicated in medicine.

448
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:56,020
What is comfort and what is murder depend
to a large degree on the intentions of

449
00:28:56,091 --> 00:28:58,640
the doctor. It's called the
principle of the double effect.

450
00:28:58,641 --> 00:29:03,641
It's sometimes credited to St Thomas
Aquinas and it's this idea that,

451
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:08,180
uh, an act that that can cause harm.
But if your intention is to do good,

452
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:10,010
then that's ethical.

453
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:13,680
And Dr. Anna Pope, did
you murder those patients?

454
00:29:13,681 --> 00:29:16,560
As the attorney general alleges? No,

455
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:21,830
I did not murder those patients and I
want everybody to know that I am not a

456
00:29:22,891 --> 00:29:26,970
murderer, that we are not murderers.

457
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,570
In that 60 minutes interview,

458
00:29:28,571 --> 00:29:33,460
Dr Poe flatly denies euthanizing anybody
and at various points in the interview,

459
00:29:33,461 --> 00:29:35,920
she is clearly distraught
at the accusation.

460
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:39,420
It completely ripped my heart out

461
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:45,940
because my entire life I have tried to
do good and my entire adult life I have

462
00:29:46,901 --> 00:29:51,460
given everything that I have within
me to take care of my patients.

463
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:54,640
But Sherry did talk to one
doctor, Dr. Ewing Cook.

464
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,580
We mentioned him earlier when we
were talking about the generators.

465
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,870
He's a doctor who deals a lot with end
of life care and he was very open with

466
00:30:01,871 --> 00:30:04,510
her about the decisions he
made. He had gone upstairs,

467
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:09,511
visited Mrs. Burgess cancer patient to
see how she was doing and he was just

468
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:14,020
thinking to himself, she's so sick.

469
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:15,520
She's got advanced cancer.

470
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:18,940
I can't imagine she would have
more than maybe a week to live.

471
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:23,260
At the best of circumstances.
She is weighted down with fluid,

472
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:26,620
which can happen toward the end
of life. So she weighs a lot.

473
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:31,030
She's on the eighth floor, so
we'd have to carry her downstairs.

474
00:30:31,031 --> 00:30:34,030
And plus there's four nurses
up here taking care of her.

475
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,890
Couldn't we use them somewhere else?

476
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,620
So he literally turned to
one of the nurses and said,

477
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,320
can you give her enough
morphine till she goes

478
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:44,440
[inaudible]

479
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:49,440
and that nurse charted huge increase
in morphine for her and she died.

480
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:55,330
And that was his thought. So he
made this decision and to this day,

481
00:30:55,331 --> 00:30:58,240
or at least the last time we spoke,
he felt he did the right thing.

482
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:01,930
He said to me, he thought it was
desperate. He saw only two choices,

483
00:31:01,931 --> 00:31:04,120
quicken their deaths or abandoned them.

484
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,820
And I mean if that was the real situation,

485
00:31:06,821 --> 00:31:10,600
there's some ethicists would say either
of those choices would be, you know,

486
00:31:10,601 --> 00:31:12,310
not justified but excusable.

487
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:16,110
But one of the arguments you could make
is that when you give up on one person,

488
00:31:16,111 --> 00:31:19,950
it then becomes a little bit easier to
give up on the next person and then the

489
00:31:19,951 --> 00:31:22,620
next person. And then suddenly
you're on a slippery slope.

490
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:24,660
And Sherry did tell us
about this one case.

491
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:27,780
His case was very haunting and at Everett,

492
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:31,710
61 year old doting
grandfather, very, very heavy.

493
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:35,580
He weighed 380 pounds and he was up
on the seventh floor of the hospital.

494
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,720
He was conscious, alert, fed
himself breakfast, asked his nurses,

495
00:31:39,721 --> 00:31:44,610
are we ready to rock and roll? He
said to one nurse who never forgot it,

496
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:48,930
Cindy, don't let them leave me behind.
Don't let them leave me behind.

497
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,740
But he had had a spinal cord
stroke. He couldn't walk.

498
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:56,460
He was on the seventh floor of the
hospital with no working elevators.

499
00:31:56,670 --> 00:32:01,670
And the staff told me they
couldn't imagine how they
would carry him down those

500
00:32:01,681 --> 00:32:05,360
flights of stairs, let alone would
a helicopter take a man of his size.

501
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:10,250
And he was one of the patients who was
found with this drug combination in his

502
00:32:10,251 --> 00:32:14,570
body. And he was, and he died. He
died, found his body was found.

503
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:15,741
And by the way,

504
00:32:15,741 --> 00:32:20,090
the other tragedy was just as those
injections took place was when the

505
00:32:20,091 --> 00:32:22,790
helicopters finally were
focused on this hospital.

506
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:28,250
[inaudible]

507
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:32,900
did a judge or a jury find anyone guilty
of manslaughter or murder or second

508
00:32:32,901 --> 00:32:36,620
degree murder or no? Nobody. No.
Nobody ended up getting convicted.

509
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,340
And again, just to remind

510
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:45,340
you how quickly a hospital can go
from a normal American well-regarded

511
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:50,470
functioning hospital to a place where
this was even considered and discussed was

512
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:53,720
so short. A Monday morning,
the storm hits Tuesday morning,

513
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:58,721
the water rises early Wednesday morning
all power goes out and this is Thursday.

514
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:02,060
Wow. That's kind of chilling to think

515
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:18,640
[inaudible]

516
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:18,821
got it.

517
00:33:18,821 --> 00:33:22,710
If all of that began with a
triage decision about which
patient should go first,

518
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,450
I'm trying to put myself in the position
of the people at that hospital and I'm

519
00:33:27,451 --> 00:33:30,990
thinking to myself, God, it'd be
really nice to have like a checklist,

520
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:34,620
like a checklist on a wall that says
here's how you do this so that I can just

521
00:33:34,621 --> 00:33:38,150
check the boxes cause God I wouldn't be
able to think my way through that. Yeah.

522
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,400
That's where I go next.

523
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:43,420
I wonder whether this story you've
just told us leads us anywhere.

524
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:47,980
The first place it would lead me would
be to ask is there a system that people

525
00:33:47,981 --> 00:33:48,850
could set up,

526
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,900
people who are reasonable and who have
the expectation that something like this

527
00:33:52,901 --> 00:33:56,980
is going to happen again somehow
somewhere maybe in my town, my hospital,

528
00:33:56,981 --> 00:33:59,230
my place. So what could we do

529
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,690
to make this not happen?

530
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:05,590
Well it's interesting you asked
because of course after Katrina,

531
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:09,520
there have been efforts since then to
come up with a protocol and according to

532
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:09,851
Sherry,

533
00:34:09,851 --> 00:34:14,650
the experience in Katrina was basically
a wake up call for doctors and hospitals

534
00:34:14,651 --> 00:34:17,530
and state governments
to think about triage.

535
00:34:17,531 --> 00:34:20,200
Like how should we
ration medical resources?

536
00:34:20,201 --> 00:34:22,690
Like if something bad happens again,

537
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:27,070
which patients do we prioritize first?
Which patients don't we prioritize,

538
00:34:27,071 --> 00:34:27,880
how do we do this?

539
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:32,500
And one of the interesting things was
that the state of Maryland decided we're

540
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:36,370
going to throw this open to our population
and have what they call deliberative

541
00:34:36,371 --> 00:34:37,151
democracy.

542
00:34:37,151 --> 00:34:42,151
So pull people together in a room from
all walks of life and have them grapple

543
00:34:42,491 --> 00:34:46,840
with this. And I was there. Oh
you went to the very first one.

544
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:51,790
I did. I'm imagining like a town hall
meeting. Was it like that or no? Yeah,

545
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:54,263
to get started.

546
00:34:55,660 --> 00:35:00,290
So just imagine a church basement in
inner city Baltimore or a conference room

547
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,950
meeting while the Howard
County. Thank you for coming,

548
00:35:02,951 --> 00:35:06,430
for giving up this gorgeous Saturday
to have what we think is a really,

549
00:35:06,431 --> 00:35:07,990
really important conversation.

550
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:13,420
There's refreshments at about 1215 we'll
take a break for you all to get lunch,

551
00:35:13,421 --> 00:35:17,140
bring it back to your table. People have
been recruited to be a part of this.

552
00:35:17,141 --> 00:35:19,540
And when I say people,
it's just regular folks.

553
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:23,470
So the researchers, let's call them that,

554
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:28,060
they get people together and we're
gonna get started. Good morning.

555
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:32,590
The, the sort of scenario is laid
out. So my name is Lee Doherty.

556
00:35:32,591 --> 00:35:35,830
I am an intensive care doctor just
down the road at Johns Hopkins.

557
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:40,860
And what we're going to be about today
is how we make decisions about who gets

558
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:43,780
life saving resources in the,

559
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:48,750
in a situation when we literally
cannot take care of everyone. Today.

560
00:35:48,751 --> 00:35:51,310
The scenario we'll talk
about is pandemic influenza.

561
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,370
They basically tell people, okay,
imagine a flu is sweeping the country.

562
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:59,450
Millions of people are sick,
coughing, some are dying.

563
00:35:59,451 --> 00:36:02,990
The only way that folks are going to
get better or they say is if they have a

564
00:36:02,991 --> 00:36:05,360
ventilator to help them
breathe. But the problem is

565
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:09,880
there just aren't enough.
This is horrible stuff.

566
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:11,900
This is a terrible situation
we're talking about

567
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:15,910
here. You have too many
patients, too few resources.

568
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,270
How do we choose who gets those phenols?

569
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,680
What are the acceptable options?
What might be the right answers?

570
00:36:21,681 --> 00:36:25,280
What the researchers then essentially
lay out three different kinds of options.

571
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,553
Number one,

572
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:31,310
try to save the most lives or years of
life by picking people with the best

573
00:36:31,311 --> 00:36:31,840
chance of [inaudible]

574
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,070
driving the pandemic,

575
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:37,390
such as giving the ventilators to young
people or healthier people. Number two,

576
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:39,880
picking people who will be the
most helpful during the pandemic.

577
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:43,540
So first responders, healthcare
providers, vaccine workers, et cetera.

578
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,030
Or number three, leave it up to
fate. Something like first come,

579
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,710
first serve or a lottery.

580
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:53,650
[inaudible]

581
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:57,510
seeing people nod. Does that make
sense? Okay, and then they say,

582
00:36:57,511 --> 00:37:00,750
we're here to answer your questions.
Talk amongst yourselves. Right? Go ahead.

583
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,590
[inaudible] ever seen any situation
in life where some things are black

584
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:23,550
[inaudible] well, my immediate reaction
to the lottery was it's a leveler.

585
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:24,623
It's all the same

586
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:29,280
scientifically responsible way to go.

587
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:33,750
I think ultimately it's fair if somebody
is going to live but be very sick.

588
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:38,280
Is that, should that go into the decision?
If we've set up guidelines then yes,

589
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,860
it's every kind of doctor, you know
what I mean? Going to be essential.

590
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:42,990
So don't say that.

591
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:48,180
Now the good news is you're a ventilator
and four year old order and I just

592
00:37:48,181 --> 00:37:49,590
think that would be the saddest thing.

593
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:54,100
Who are willing to engage in this
question, and this was right at the time,

594
00:37:54,101 --> 00:37:56,740
you guys remember all the
death panel discussions.

595
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:05,830
Sarah Pailin in black and white, of
course her death pounds in there.

596
00:38:05,831 --> 00:38:07,400
This started at that time

597
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,570
and there weren't any fist fights.
No, but as you can also hear,

598
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:16,880
I'm all for the first come first serve
and nobody has to put that in their

599
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:22,000
context at first because you there and
I got there half a second and that is,

600
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,920
there wasn't a lot of agreement.

601
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:28,410
I respect your opinion but I'm
just dealing with you downs.

602
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,730
I think that a time of crisis,

603
00:38:31,731 --> 00:38:34,610
there's no room for emotions
if you're trying to say,

604
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:38,080
oh we to judge it by person, the
person. There's exceptions to the rule.

605
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,030
That's emotion talking
and there was no gain.

606
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:44,740
So if you're looking at everything that's
going on and that's why I have those

607
00:38:44,741 --> 00:38:48,220
set up providing all of this, some
people are going to have to go.

608
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:52,940
The big findings was that
there are certain ways in
which we will not make these

609
00:38:52,941 --> 00:38:57,050
decisions. There were things that the
researchers wanted to be off the table,

610
00:38:57,051 --> 00:38:59,420
like not even come into the discussion.

611
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:04,050
We're not going to make decisions based
on gender, race, socioeconomic status,

612
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:08,700
people's jobs and incomes and
citizenship status and you know,

613
00:39:08,701 --> 00:39:13,080
whether they had a criminal history or
where they upstanding members of society.

614
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,760
Those things are out of bounds. I
just want to say up front, that's not,

615
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:19,180
that's not up progress, but
those things kept popping up.

616
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:24,300
You have to have it like a young pastor
and you might have reprehensible,

617
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,980
alcoholic,

618
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:32,220
criminal type person and he
might have more years to live.

619
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:38,520
All the years of the pastor are going
to be more beneficial to society and the

620
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:42,940
years of this a criminal,
reprehensible, Alcoholic Dad,

621
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:48,020
Whoa, you are straying
into iffy territory there.

622
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,320
That is a personal,

623
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,620
there were people who thought that
undocumented immigrants shouldn't get

624
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:59,720
ventilators, alcoholics, smokers,

625
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:04,200
curse and the worlds will be a better
place in the most brutal terms possible.

626
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:09,300
They're saying, do you deserve
to survive? Not Can I save you,

627
00:40:09,301 --> 00:40:11,100
but should I try and save you?

628
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,810
What's interesting is that, um,

629
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:17,620
people were really comfortable making
utilitarian choices, like saying, yeah,

630
00:40:17,621 --> 00:40:20,800
that person should get the ventilator
because they're going to benefit the

631
00:40:20,801 --> 00:40:21,850
greater good in some way.

632
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:25,270
But if that ever got formulated
in a slightly different way,

633
00:40:25,271 --> 00:40:29,260
which is to say that person should get
the ventilator because they deserve it

634
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:33,940
more than another because their life
has more value than another person will,

635
00:40:33,941 --> 00:40:35,500
then people like we're not cool with that.

636
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,710
And yet you would hear people say
it that way again and again and then

637
00:40:38,711 --> 00:40:42,580
immediately be repulsed when they
heard someone else say it that way.

638
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:47,220
I don't think you can determine who has
done what in their life and how that's

639
00:40:47,221 --> 00:40:50,200
valuable. I might think my
hairdressers want to board

640
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:56,830
their appointment, right? I want to
look good during my panic situations,

641
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:01,320
and this was particularly acute when
participants were asked the second,

642
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,250
can we move to an even
more controversial topic?

643
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:08,740
Really hard question, would
it be acceptable to you?

644
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:13,600
Do you think it's acceptable to ever
remove a ventilator from one patient to

645
00:41:13,601 --> 00:41:14,530
give it to somebody else?

646
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:17,630
Just this one. I definitely don't
have a clear answer by style.

647
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:19,770
Some people said, well,

648
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:23,490
of course if it doesn't seem like someone
who's going to make it through the

649
00:41:23,491 --> 00:41:26,910
treatments, then it we need to cut it,

650
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:30,660
cut their treatment short and passed
out. Then later on to someone else but

651
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:34,460
murder my father. There
were other people who said,

652
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:34,940
no,

653
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:39,940
you take my father off center tunnel
later and I'm still going to be shoot the

654
00:41:40,551 --> 00:41:43,150
rest of your life. It's like
never going to sign off.

655
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,040
It's a terrible thing to think
about, but it's necessary.

656
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,900
So complicated.

657
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:57,710
Did they come to a conclusion? Did you,
Chad, did you hear a conclusion like,

658
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,080
I listen to this, I, here's what I heard.

659
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:05,110
I heard thoughtful people struggling with
a problem that is so hard to struggle

660
00:42:06,951 --> 00:42:09,170
with that what they end up doing is going,

661
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,810
I don't know how I don't want to do this.

662
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,780
I'm paying more attention to your
guidelines cause I can't deal with this.

663
00:42:14,781 --> 00:42:15,830
What I loved about it,

664
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:21,070
the number one response was to try to
get out of the situation and find ways to

665
00:42:21,111 --> 00:42:24,490
avoid having to ration. That's the
most important part of this. Let's not,

666
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:26,360
just before we prejudge this,

667
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,420
what is it the researchers are going
to take away from all of this? Well,

668
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:33,020
a couple of things that they
got out of it. A number one,

669
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:37,160
remember we talked about the different
ways of deciding that they put out for

670
00:42:37,161 --> 00:42:39,050
people to discuss? Well,

671
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:43,170
it turns out they wanted to combine
some of those different perspectives and

672
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:47,270
then Sherry, a lot of people thought,
sure, let's start out. Utilitarian.

673
00:42:47,271 --> 00:42:50,810
Let's try and save the most lives by
picking the people who are most likely to

674
00:42:50,811 --> 00:42:53,450
survive if they're likely
to survive and they need it.

675
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:57,350
But chances are there's gonna be a lot
of people who fit in that category.

676
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:00,280
So if everybody's just about
the same and we can't really,

677
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:04,110
we don't have like great science that
allows us to know which patient is going

678
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:07,700
to survive and which ones not
going to. So for that second tier,

679
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,100
let's do it randomly,
let's just be really,

680
00:43:10,101 --> 00:43:12,050
really fair and give
everyone an equal chance.

681
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:15,770
So it's like you introduce a little bit
of fate to keep things honest. Exactly.

682
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:18,290
And the, and the research said, do
you know what? This is a good idea.

683
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:21,740
Let's see if we could maybe put
this concept into the protocol.

684
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:25,010
Am I right in thinking that these
guidelines, whatever they end up being,

685
00:43:25,011 --> 00:43:29,930
are designed to avoid that sort of like
sorting based on who deserves it and who

686
00:43:29,931 --> 00:43:31,100
doesn't. Yeah.

687
00:43:31,101 --> 00:43:36,101
I mean there's some fairness in having
guidelines and especially guidelines that

688
00:43:36,201 --> 00:43:38,530
were developed with the input
of lots of people. Yeah.

689
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:43,550
So even if we don't like
the choices that are made,

690
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:48,290
we don't end up getting the ventilator
or our loved one doesn't. Overall,

691
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:51,920
if you know that there's a protocol
out there and this is the rule,

692
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:53,990
here's why we had to adopt this rule.

693
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:57,680
It's being applied to everybody and
you're not going to be advantaged or

694
00:43:57,681 --> 00:44:02,090
disadvantaged over money
or over these other things.

695
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:03,980
It sort of helps you accept it.

696
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:08,000
In theory that sounds plausible,

697
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:10,550
but when you put theory to practice,

698
00:44:10,551 --> 00:44:12,440
which we're going to do
right after the break,

699
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:16,450
things get very hard. That's coming up.

Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad, I'm Robert Krulwich,

716
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:45,970
Radiolab and returning now to our
collaboration with the New York Times and

717
00:45:45,971 --> 00:45:49,310
reporters, Sherry Fink. Uh, this is
our final stop. Many ways are hard,

718
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:54,040
hardest stop because it's the closest
we're going to come to sort of the heart

719
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:56,110
of the issues we've been talking about.

720
00:45:56,380 --> 00:46:00,880
And you realize that when you get
up close as Sherry's about to, uh,

721
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:05,890
sometimes what's a success and what's
a failure or kind of hard to measure

722
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,600
test. We can,

723
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,750
we can even do the tip
VIPs and we want to value.

724
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:18,350
I remember being in Haiti after
the Haiti earthquake back in 2010.

725
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:22,490
I'm sorry, I got a 40 year old male. I
don't know what's going to happen here.

Embedded with a group of
us disaster responders,

728
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:32,900
What's your name again? Sherry,

729
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:36,770
you were in this tent
hospital and at this point,

730
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,610
maybe about a week and a half after
the earthquake, there were so,

731
00:46:40,611 --> 00:46:44,480
so many casualties, more than a
hundred thousand people could be dead.

732
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,690
It was patient after patient
kind of lined up in a row.

733
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:52,750
Most of the things we had are
dehydration, sepsis, festering wounds,

734
00:46:52,751 --> 00:46:54,060
open fractures. Yeah,

735
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:58,990
they didn't have enough resources and
they were running out of oxygen tanks and

736
00:46:58,991 --> 00:47:02,110
then they were also trying to
use these oxygen concentrators,

737
00:47:02,111 --> 00:47:04,330
which pull oxygen from the environment,

738
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:08,860
but they rely on power and they were
running out of diesel for the generators.

739
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:09,840
Logistics.

740
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:14,840
We're at a critical level with our
diesel supply and oxygen for the are so

741
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:21,210
freaking today. I mean I am
freaking Frey for us and logistics.

742
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:28,160
The trade of major for this was a
hospital that had set up to do surgery.

743
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:30,940
They needed oxygen,
they didn't have enough.

744
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:34,720
So the question became who were they
going to give it to and who were they not?

745
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:39,990
And at one point, senior
sharpness lead you in ICU.

746
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:43,480
I was following a couple of the
doctors. We walked into this tent

747
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,840
[inaudible] and we met this woman, hi.

748
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:50,430
She had braided hair,

749
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:54,450
a white nightgown on and this
tube running into her notes.

750
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:55,663
Okay.

751
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,910
[inaudible] and how old are you guys?

752
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:06,910
38 30 years ago. Oh, okay. Tell
her we're almost the same age,

753
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:10,720
which gave him that Guy Betty,
how are you feeling today?

754
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:16,930
[inaudible] yeah, she's very bad.
[inaudible] did you run out of medicine?

755
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:21,400
And she was doing all right.
That's good. [inaudible]

756
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:25,580
in speaking to her, I found out that
she was from Puerto Prince, the capitol,

757
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:30,700
and that during the earthquake her house
had collapsed and everyone inside it,

758
00:48:31,071 --> 00:48:35,270
she said, which was most of her
extended family. They, they died

759
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:40,940
[inaudible] you will all stay together
like you know Macy's nephew cause there's

760
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:44,220
an everyday so sorry. [inaudible]

761
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:49,320
she told me that amazingly
she had survived because
she wasn't at home when the

762
00:48:51,341 --> 00:48:52,690
earthquake hit. Yes, it does.

763
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:56,200
Ending that she checked into this hospital
[inaudible] hospital downtown very

764
00:48:56,201 --> 00:49:00,100
shortly before the earthquake happened
because she had had chronic lung

765
00:49:00,101 --> 00:49:00,731
problems.

766
00:49:00,731 --> 00:49:05,320
So she was there to get treatment and
after the earthquake she was transferred

767
00:49:05,321 --> 00:49:06,520
to this American hospital.

768
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:10,140
Cool. How do you feel about the
treatment that you got here? Oh,

769
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:14,720
did the big new, was it the
good, oh, they treat me well way,

770
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,860
way better than anywhere that she's been

771
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:22,820
[inaudible] them, send them
Golfer. Everyone's a fanfare.

772
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:25,740
She'd been gone for the American people
could do the one that's in charge right

773
00:49:25,741 --> 00:49:29,970
now because God is really using them
and put them in charge of all the thing

774
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:34,820
that is going on and I love
about love about marriage.

775
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:38,700
God bless Obama. I'm happy
to see a smile on your face.

776
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:41,360
[inaudible] I see.

777
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:44,450
I started to speak with the staff about

778
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:49,190
alright, you've been taking
care of her. Yeah. Basically

779
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:54,210
I found out that Natalie had just won
the hearts of the surgical staff there.

780
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,090
People loved her. She was so thankful.

781
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:59,150
But she has a chronic illness,

782
00:49:59,151 --> 00:50:04,151
which is severe heart failure
and hypertension and it's
very hard for us to see

783
00:50:05,091 --> 00:50:08,510
her leave. [inaudible]

784
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:12,150
told me they had plans
to take her off oxygen.

785
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:16,380
They were going to turn down the
oxygen slowly to try to make it more

786
00:50:16,381 --> 00:50:21,060
comfortable and then they were going to
send her off to a Haitian facility that

787
00:50:21,061 --> 00:50:24,450
didn't have oxygen, but where
she would presumably die.

788
00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:29,810
And if you're thinking in terms
of hard triage theory, you know,

789
00:50:29,811 --> 00:50:32,660
this makes sense because they
were trying to save oxygen.

790
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,060
She has a chronic problem that
probably won't get better.

791
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:39,800
So that's like the theory of it. But
the practice of it was quite different.

792
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:43,760
She had absolutely no idea that
they were about to do this.

793
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:46,490
She had all this hope for her future

794
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:48,973
should get well.

795
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:53,570
She prayed to God that she would
have an opportunity to earn a living,

796
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:57,830
but I'm [inaudible] seven wants to
go there to the dog. She wants to go.

797
00:50:57,831 --> 00:50:58,910
When she did the Astrodome,

798
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:03,890
is there any way possible then the people
would give her like somewhere to stay

799
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:07,200
that some kind of shelter? One that I am,

800
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:10,790
I mean I'm a journalist and I don't
know the answer to that, but I,

801
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:14,300
I don't know what to say. It's
such a hard situation right now.

802
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:15,393
How did your mind start with that?

803
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,880
Where the nurse who was doing the triage,

804
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:20,940
who'd made that decision
to cut off her oxygen?

805
00:51:21,610 --> 00:51:26,480
I'm Patrick Cadillac. I'm the commander
for the insert team. Had never met her.

806
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:28,580
No, I never met the patient,

807
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:33,860
but that's the role pattern that
we're running out of oxygen.

808
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:38,930
The country itself doesn't have
oxygen, so I have to make the decision.

809
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:41,180
No, she can't cut the oxygen, turn it off.

810
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:46,750
I have to look at the greater good
that we can provide with the limited

811
00:51:46,761 --> 00:51:49,280
resources. We have Jack Right now.

812
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:53,940
Oh, I see. Okay. And so
then I followed that woman.

813
00:51:55,910 --> 00:52:00,910
I wanted to see this on a human level
as well as on the abstract level.

814
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:06,590
The transporters came a few
hours later, look around,

815
00:52:06,591 --> 00:52:09,350
go ahead and get him up there. He
was the 82nd airborne actually,

816
00:52:09,351 --> 00:52:13,370
who were providing that service. They
were amazing and they came to pick her up.

817
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:19,010
She traveled, they saw she was
on oxygen. They said, okay,

818
00:52:19,011 --> 00:52:21,710
we're going to put her on
their portable oxygen tanks,

819
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:27,140
and the representative from
the hospital said, oh no, no.

820
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:29,030
She doesn't get oxygen

821
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:30,493
ready to go,

822
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:36,530
so they yanked the
oxygen Durbar all right,

823
00:52:36,531 --> 00:52:38,730
ready to strapped her onto
a stretcher. [inaudible]

824
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:41,833
lifted her up,

825
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:46,310
stuck her in the back of this Humvee
ambulance Fletcher head by going with,

826
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:48,860
okay, we're going to hop
in your car. Go home.

827
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:57,710
I rode with her coming
up. Okay, mom, I'm fine.

828
00:52:58,390 --> 00:52:59,223
Well,

829
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,250
she started getting short of breath.

830
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:03,573
Oh, so you hadn't

831
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:15,440
[inaudible]

832
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:19,160
put this asthma inhaler in her mouth.
She kept hitting it over and over again.

833
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:24,480
She thought it was oxygen. It was
horrific to watch her start. Sorry

834
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:27,060
to suffer. I felt complicit.

835
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:32,660
I was doing a story and I knew very well
that they had chosen for her to to die

836
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:41,660
and just watching didn't feel
it didn't feel right and so,

837
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,430
hello. You guys see, Whoa, whoa.

838
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:50,190
Watch that movie.

839
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:54,690
It stopped at this hospital and I nodded
over toward her and some of the medical

840
00:53:54,691 --> 00:53:57,790
staff went to to look at
her, how they go in glaze.

841
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:01,770
No one could see she was in
distress. They brought her inside.

842
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:08,010
She was really struggling to breathe,
but then she's definitely big time CHF.

843
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:11,010
I saw one of my medical school professors,

844
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:14,130
an emergency doctor and
I told them about her.

845
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:18,720
Is it, whose is this? Sorry,
is that hers? Yes. Here honey,

846
00:54:18,721 --> 00:54:23,080
this mama going, you sit up. Okay Mama.

847
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:24,673
Okay.

848
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:29,750
It's like no, it's like back a
little bit and she improvised

849
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:33,190
[inaudible] write it out.

850
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:37,010
She used like all these diuretics
to get fluid off her lungs,

851
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:38,530
nitrates or anything.

852
00:54:40,430 --> 00:54:44,030
And he found one tank of oxygen
that had a teeny bit last minute

853
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:50,960
breathe, breathe better. Okay.

854
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:58,933
And

855
00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:04,610
he was able to extend her life.

856
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:07,400
All right, well I'll see you tomorrow.

857
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:12,433
[inaudible]

858
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:22,660
ultimately I actually felt
a responsibility for her
that outlasted the story

859
00:55:24,471 --> 00:55:28,040
that I did. Um, and so
after that came out, I,

860
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:32,570
I did attempt to help her. Really? Yeah.

861
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,210
Well, I, uh,

862
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:40,130
found a charitable group that was
willing to bring her to the u s under a

863
00:55:40,131 --> 00:55:44,500
certain type of visa program that
allowed for humanitarian, uh,

864
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,400
like a medical treatment. And the,

865
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:51,070
the cardiologists who had examined
her and Haiti had thought she had, uh,

866
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:55,490
a rheumatic heart disease that was causing
her lung problems and that it could

867
00:55:55,491 --> 00:55:59,720
be surgically corrected. But
when she came to the u s in fact,

868
00:55:59,810 --> 00:56:04,730
it was found that she had a much more
serious condition and she really needed a

869
00:56:04,731 --> 00:56:08,240
transplant and she didn't, didn't make it.

870
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:14,420
Does this make you wonder?

871
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:19,580
So here you've got a rule and maybe
in some broad way it's helping,

872
00:56:19,581 --> 00:56:23,030
but in that vehicle, looking at this,

873
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:29,010
you wanted to break the rules for very
moral and decent reasons in these extreme

874
00:56:32,561 --> 00:56:36,640
circumstances where life and death
are wrestling with each other.

875
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:41,590
Can you make rules? I mean, I, yeah,

876
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:45,970
because it's like you can't fault the
people for taking her off the oxygen and

877
00:56:45,971 --> 00:56:49,470
you can't fault you for trying
to get her on the oxygen. So, uh,

878
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:53,290
what's the conclusion to draw?
Well, let's not give up. You know,

879
00:56:53,291 --> 00:56:57,220
the conclusion is let's not give
up. Like it turns out there was,

880
00:56:57,310 --> 00:56:58,840
there were options for this woman.

881
00:56:58,841 --> 00:57:01,960
It turns out that somebody
was able to extend her life.

882
00:57:01,961 --> 00:57:06,670
Now you could very well argue that she
should have died in that moment because

883
00:57:06,671 --> 00:57:09,760
look at all the resources that
were spent. But I just feel like,

884
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:13,630
like there was some value in her
existence. There was so much value.

885
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,480
She came to the u s and my God,

886
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:20,590
she took up a collection for all the
patients back in the Haitian hospital who

887
00:57:20,591 --> 00:57:24,540
she was friends with. She contributed
til the day she died and she,

888
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:29,230
she changed my life too. So I don't
know how to do the math on this one. Uh,

889
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:30,460
this is the problem.

890
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:33,870
No, well [inaudible] real
quickly guidelines is required,

891
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:35,200
like a lack of compassion,

892
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:38,080
the cold hard rigidness of
it and everything you're
talking about has to do with

893
00:57:38,081 --> 00:57:40,270
compassion. This is
Simon Adler by the way,

894
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:44,830
our producer and how do you make
compassion work on that large of a scale

895
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:49,900
without caring about people and then you
care about some people more than other

896
00:57:49,901 --> 00:57:52,810
people and then, oh shit,
now, now we're hurting.

897
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:57,150
That's a very good point. If
you don't systematize it, you,

898
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:02,220
you risk choosing people based on
factors that are really not fair.

899
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:03,113
Exactly.

900
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:06,450
Because part of me does wonder like what
if Natalie weren't such a nice person?

901
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:11,070
Would her, would that have
changed things? Well, you know,

902
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:14,610
if Natalie was a mean person that I don't
think I would have felt any better or

903
00:58:14,611 --> 00:58:18,390
watching her suffer. It's just
about the person in front of you.

904
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:21,780
And I think that the
more unbearable it is,

905
00:58:21,781 --> 00:58:23,790
so the more you have to
look someone in the eyes,

906
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:28,880
the more it makes us try to figure
out creative ways to avoid doing it.

907
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:31,260
Okay. But I do feel you,

908
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:35,490
I'm somehow refusing to acknowledge
the subject point. It really,

909
00:58:35,491 --> 00:58:38,190
really gets tough. You say, let's,

910
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:40,740
let's avoid that toughness
over and over again.

911
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:42,510
Let's know I'm facing the real problem,

912
00:58:42,511 --> 00:58:44,580
which is that it's a
problem to have to ration,

913
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:49,200
but we're not gonna figure out the best
way to ration because there is no one

914
00:58:49,201 --> 00:58:52,200
best way because everyone in society
will have a different view on that.

915
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:55,380
I think that that's in some
way unimpeachable I think
you're absolutely right.

916
00:58:55,381 --> 00:58:58,080
We should always strive to
not have to make the choice,

917
00:58:58,081 --> 00:59:02,190
but with we do have to make the
choice. How do we do it? Well,

918
00:59:02,191 --> 00:59:04,020
that's a very tough question.

919
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:10,010
Let me tell you that I think what you've
hit upon here is an impossible piece of

920
00:59:11,011 --> 00:59:14,760
human business, rationing,
triage, whatever you call it,

921
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:20,190
is an inhuman act, which
humans are trying to do,

922
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:22,400
but the of their humanity

923
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,750
makes it impossible. So what we've
got here is we've kind of, you know,

924
00:59:26,751 --> 00:59:31,751
a real deep problem the other
than God role and nobody fits it.

925
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:53,470
[inaudible] [inaudible]

926
00:59:53,470 --> 00:59:56,590
we have so many people to
thank for this. Uh, our, uh,

927
00:59:56,650 --> 01:00:01,480
let's start with Lily Sullivan and Pat
Walters for really getting us thinking

928
01:00:01,481 --> 01:00:04,000
about all of this. Thank you
lily. Thank you pat. Thank you.

929
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:05,590
