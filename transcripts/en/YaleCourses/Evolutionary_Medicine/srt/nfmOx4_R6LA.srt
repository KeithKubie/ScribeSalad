1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,560
We now begin a series of lectures on
defenses and at the outset it's important

2
00:00:07,431 --> 00:00:11,120
to make the point that defense and
maintenance are different things,

3
00:00:11,121 --> 00:00:14,300
but they both originated
in homeostatic mechanisms.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,833
Okay.

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,420
They evolved as modifications
of normal physiology

6
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:26,130
and a take home point for all of the
discussion of defense is that evolution

7
00:00:26,141 --> 00:00:31,141
will tolerate high costs and will permit
significant vulnerabilities if it can

8
00:00:31,751 --> 00:00:33,940
thereby gain major benefits.

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,600
And that is the reason that all associated
with every defense mechanism there is

10
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:41,163
a disease.

11
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:47,050
So just to distinguish between
homeostasis, maintenance and defense,

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,550
homeostasis is the stability
of key variables in cells,

13
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:54,880
tissues and organisms.
That's controlled by feedback mechanisms.

14
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,270
Most maintenance and defense mechanisms,

15
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:03,790
we're evolutionarily derived by
modifying homeostatic functions.

16
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:05,770
Okay.

17
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:09,550
Maintenance mechanism,
sustain normal function by preventing,

18
00:01:09,551 --> 00:01:14,551
repairing and reducing malfunctions that
are byproducts of normal physiology.

19
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:15,740
Okay.

20
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,750
Defense mechanisms on the other hand,

21
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:22,970
protect against specific hostile
environmental perturbations that exceed

22
00:01:22,971 --> 00:01:24,350
homeostatic capacity.

23
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:26,490
Yeah,

24
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,130
so if we look at that in
the form of a diagram,

25
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,630
we can start with developmental
and physiological processes.

26
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:39,410
They are affected by hostile environmental
factors and they are regulated by

27
00:01:39,631 --> 00:01:44,600
homeostasis.
They produce deleterious byproducts.

28
00:01:44,601 --> 00:01:49,480
The physiology and development and the
hostile environmental factors can produce

29
00:01:49,481 --> 00:01:53,950
tissue deterioration, malfunction in
damage, as well as the normal processes.

30
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,740
So defense interferes with the
hostile environmental factors.

31
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:04,390
Hostile environmental factors interfere
with normal development and physiology.

32
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:09,940
Maintenance interferes with tissue
deterioration in malfunction.

33
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:15,850
So you can see that defense maintenance
and homeostasis or conceptually

34
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,773
separated.

35
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,343
Yeah.

36
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,540
Here's an example that makes
concrete these three processes.

37
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:28,541
Homeostasis is regulating protein
concentration in a cell by synthesis and

38
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:30,584
degradation.

39
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:36,020
Maintenance mechanisms are detecting
and clearing damaged proteins.

40
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,160
Viruses are detected by
the innate immune system,

41
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,730
which induces an antiviral defense.

42
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:49,340
Defenses, however, operate at
the expense of homeostasis.

43
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:53,030
During viral infection,
protein synthesis shuts down.

44
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,130
Defense increases the
concentration of damaged proteins,

45
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,490
which are then handled by
maintenance mechanisms.

46
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,600
So maintenance contributes to the
tolerance component of defense and the

47
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:11,440
mechanisms that eliminate the virus
represent the resistance component of

48
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,274
defense.

49
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,760
So there was a relationship between this
level of physiological analysis and the

50
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:21,370
distinction between
tolerance and resistance.

51
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,010
Yeah.

52
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,290
Now there are two types of maintenance.

53
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:30,070
There is constitutive and
inducible maintenance.

54
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,950
So here again,

55
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:36,340
we can start with the developmental
and physiological processes that are

56
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:40,270
degenerating byproducts
and tissue deterioration.

57
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:45,940
The constituency of maintenance
processes are those that are handling the

58
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:48,670
byproducts of normal
development and physiology.

59
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,660
The hostile environmental factors,
including pathogens,

60
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:58,410
are producing deleterious effects at the
physiological level and they are being

61
00:03:58,511 --> 00:04:01,750
dealt with by inducible
maintenance programs.

62
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,730
The constituent of maintenance programs
compliment homeostasis and the inducible

63
00:04:06,731 --> 00:04:09,010
programs compliment defense.

64
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:11,570
Yeah.

65
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:15,110
Here are some examples of
constitutive maintenance mechanisms.

66
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:20,420
The removal of damaged proteins
and lipids, so in aging,

67
00:04:20,421 --> 00:04:22,100
that leads to neurodegeneration.

68
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,090
Yeah,

69
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:28,470
the detoxification and disposable and
disposal of metabolic waste products,

70
00:04:28,471 --> 00:04:30,690
so with aging,
when that breaks down,

71
00:04:30,691 --> 00:04:33,600
you get liver and kidney
insufficiency and disease.

72
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,700
The clearance of damaged
extracellular proteins with aging,

73
00:04:38,701 --> 00:04:40,650
that leads to tissue degeneration.

74
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:42,770
Yeah.

75
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:47,630
Tissue renewal by stem cells with aging.
If that is not done properly,

76
00:04:47,631 --> 00:04:49,910
there is cancer and other diseases.

77
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:51,890
Okay.

78
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:55,730
The maintenance of homeostatic mechanisms.
If that breaks down,

79
00:04:55,731 --> 00:04:58,940
then aging can lead to type
two diabetes and osteoporosis.

80
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,130
Yeah.

81
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:04,640
The maintenance of tissues, that is
new, that are needed for defense,

82
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:08,960
which includes of course
the immune system. If that
breaks down. Then with aging,

83
00:05:08,961 --> 00:05:11,450
we have increased
susceptibility to infections.

84
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,710
Examples of inducible
maintenance mechanisms,

85
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,890
those that are reacting to
environmental hostilities

86
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:25,700
have the characteristic
that when they're deployed,

87
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:28,910
normal maintenance mechanisms
ramp up to support them.

88
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:31,260
Yeah.

89
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:35,760
These include responses to starvation,
cold dehydration and hypoxia.

90
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:40,500
All of these are eroded by aging
and some organisms.

91
00:05:40,501 --> 00:05:43,500
There is hibernation,
estivation, Dour Larvae,

92
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:47,370
sporulation Lord metabolic rate,
less need for oxygen,

93
00:05:47,371 --> 00:05:48,720
food and water,

94
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,710
better protection of organs and tissues
and better resistance to stress,

95
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,970
greater tolerance of damage and
changed homeostatic set points,

96
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:02,710
so those would all be
radical restructurings of
underlying physiology to deal

97
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:08,240
with unavoidable environmental stress.

98
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:10,910
Okay.

99
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,970
If we contrast inducible and
constituent of processes,

100
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:17,330
we see that constituent of
maintenance operates all the time.

101
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,470
It doesn't trade off with growth or
reproduction within a single organism.

102
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,940
Constituent of maintenance is not
trading off with growth and reproduction.

103
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:32,360
Inducible maintenance responds to
hostile challenges to promote survival.

104
00:06:32,361 --> 00:06:34,940
Well,
it reduces growth and reproduction.

105
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:36,500
Yeah,

106
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,180
reduced maintenance compromises.

107
00:06:38,181 --> 00:06:43,181
Both homeostasis and defense both need
to be maintained at the population level.

108
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:45,831
However,

109
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:49,730
maintenance we'll trade off with growth
and reproduction if it is negatively,

110
00:06:49,731 --> 00:06:50,990
genetically correlated.

111
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:55,610
So this statement is about
physiological tradeoffs,

112
00:06:55,670 --> 00:07:00,290
and this statement is about evolutionary
and genetically based tradeoffs.

113
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:02,770
Okay.

114
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:07,390
Defenses that are only needed on demand
and that have high costs have evolved to

115
00:07:07,391 --> 00:07:10,540
be inducible.
So the immune responses are inducible.

116
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:12,420
Yeah.

117
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,240
Defenses that are always needed.
Our constituent IV,

118
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,940
that includes barrier
defenses such as skin.

119
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:20,930
Okay.

120
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,450
To summarize,
homeostasis,

121
00:07:23,451 --> 00:07:26,030
maintenance and defense
are intimately related.

122
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:27,720
Okay.

123
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,700
Maintenance and defense mechanisms are
extensions of homeostasis mechanisms,

124
00:07:32,701 --> 00:07:36,090
and they are often
evolutionarily derived from them.

125
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,350
That's important because it means that
maintenance and maintenance and defense

126
00:07:40,351 --> 00:07:44,700
mechanisms bring with their
evolutionary heritage,

127
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,890
the advantages and the vulnerabilities
of that evolutionary heritage.

128
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,920
Homeostasis,
maintenance,

129
00:07:52,921 --> 00:07:57,420
and defense all have both
constitutive and inducible components.

130
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:03,860
Whether the constituent or inducible
mode of operation evolves depends on the

131
00:08:03,861 --> 00:08:05,360
demand and the cost.
