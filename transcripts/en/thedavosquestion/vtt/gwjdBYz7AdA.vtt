00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:05.569
&gt;&gt;Well thanks very much for your questions
and your posting. I don't agree. We've got

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.740
to make sure that growth and the environment
are not alternatives, but they go together.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.160
We need green growth. So I don't think that
there is some set level of growth that if

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.509
you exceed you'll necessarily damage the environment.
We gonna make sure that growth can go along

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:25.070
with perfecting our environment. How do we
do that? For instance,we're gonna make sure

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.529
that when it comes to electricity generation,
and distribution, and use. We have a smart-grid

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.680
that people can interact with. That you can
produce your own electricity. You can sale

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.050
the surplus back to the grid. You can plug
in electric cars. You can make possible the

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.920
renewable energies that can be need to be
used bulk like tidal,wind,wave and solar power.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.320
So these things mustn't be alternative. The
role of politicians is we've got to work at

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.710
is how you make growth and greenery go together.
And I thinik that it's particulary important

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.160
that in a recession, we don't junk our committment
to the environment and tackling climate change.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.620
I think it's tempting for politicians to say
"Look of course the prority must be everything

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.660
to do with the recession, let'sforget about
the environment. That would be a mistake.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.110
We gonna make sure we do things now that help
people to get out of the recession,to get

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.620
jobs,and that help businesses,but are also
good for environment in the future. And investing

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.580
in green technology and green businesses and
green ideas for the future is one that would

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:23.150
work very well
