00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.950
Alright, we're on problem 59.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:05.890
59 on page 282.

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.800
If a real estate agent received
a commission of 6% of

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.730
the selling price of a certain
house, what was the selling

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.340
price of the house?

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.600
So the price of the house.

00:00:18.355 --> 00:00:20.880
And they just told us that the
real estate agent received 6%

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.950
percent but that alone
doesn't tell us much.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.660
So statement number one, they
tell us the selling price

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.360
minus the real estate agent's
commission was $84,600.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.200
So let's see if we can write
that algebraically.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.330
The selling price, let's say
p for price, minus the real

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.850
estate agent's commission--
well, the they told us at the

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.240
beginning the real estate
agent received 6% of the

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.410
selling price.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.040
So that's 0.06, 6%
of the price.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.480
So they're telling us that
that is equal to $84,600.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.780
Well, we're done!

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.520
That's a linear equation
with one unknown.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.650
This is algebra one.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.070
You can solve for this.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.540
Let's see, you could say this
is, I mean if you had to,

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.500
0.94p is equal to 84,600 and
then you'd have p is equal to

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.940
84,600 divided by 0.94,
whatever that is.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.290
But we don't care.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.730
We just have to know that
we could solve it.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.820
Well, since we got so close,
let's just solve it.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.210
84,600 divided by point-- this
is a bad habit when you're

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.400
taking the GMAT, you want to
just know that you could solve

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.070
it-- so the selling price
of the house is $90,000.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.990
We didn't have to solve that.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.913
That would be a waste of time
on the real GMAT but I just

00:01:36.913 --> 00:01:40.080
wanted to show you how
easy it was to solve.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.770
Statement number two,
let's see if this is

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.450
independently useful.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.200
The selling price was
250% of the original

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:55.910
purchase price of $36,000.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.930
We chose p as the selling
price, right?

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.910
The selling price minus-- right,
everything we talked

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.150
about before was the
selling price.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.410
And now they introduce
this thing called

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:04.740
the purchase price.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.860
So the price selling is equal
to-- and that's what we're

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.970
going to figure out--
is equal to 250%.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.510
So that's 2.5 times the purchase
price of $36,000.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.470
So times $36,000.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.420
Actually we didn't have
to write this.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.700
So the price is 2.5 times 36,000
which is, I'm guessing,

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.180
let's see, 72, yep, it's
$90,000 again.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.960
We didn't have to do that.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.820
But once again, this is just a
very-- this is actually not

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:34.480
even algebra.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.620
You just have to multiply
2.5 times 36,000 and

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:37.690
your get the answer.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.140
So each of these, independently,
are enough to

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.210
solve this problem.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.340
So that's D.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.650
Next problem.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.460
60.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.360
This yellow's a little
bit over the top.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.860
Let me do more muted color.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.950
So they write, if the square
root of x/y is equal to-- what

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.460
does that say-- d?

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.880
Right, is that what
they wrote?

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.810
Is equal to d?

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.160
No, that's equal to n I think.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.640
Alright, is equal to n, what
is the value of x?

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.770
So statement number one,
they tell us that

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:20.590
yn is equal to 10.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.790
Well, this is pretty useful
because this first equation

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.430
they give us, we would just
multiply both sides by y, we

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.620
get square root of x is
equal to yn, right?

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.920
y times both sides
gets us this.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.760
And if yn is equal to 10 then
we know that the square root

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.240
of x is equal to 10.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.840
So x is equal to 100.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.860
So statement one alone
is enough.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.620
Now what does statement
two do for us?

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:54.120
They tell us y is equal to
40 and n is equal to 1/4.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.780
So once again, they substituted
everything else,

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.155
so we just have to
solve for x.

00:03:59.155 --> 00:04:02.250
So both of these individually
are enough so the answer is D.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.270
But we could solve for
it just for fun.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:10.810
We get square root of x/40 is
equal to 1/4 and then you get,

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.632
essentially solving this,
you get square root of

00:04:12.632 --> 00:04:13.600
x is equal to 10.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.680
And you get the same thing, x
is equal to 100 and you are

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.820
all done, right?

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.450
And you might say, oh, but isn't
there a plus or minus?

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.180
No, because we're saying the
square root of something is

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.070
equal to 10.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.700
We're not saying the square
root of 100 is what?

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.590
If you said what is the square
root of a 100 you'd say it's

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:28.395
plus or minus 10.

00:04:28.395 --> 00:04:31.200
But if we said the square root
of something is 10 that

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.150
something has to be 100.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.490
Anyway, next problem.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.540
Don't want to dilly-dally.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.756
61.

00:04:41.756 --> 00:04:45.870
I want to imbue you with a sense
of urgency for the GMAT.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.150
How many integers are there
between, but not

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.560
including, r and s.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.850
Fair enough.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.190
So essentially we have to figure
out what r and s are or

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.000
how far part they are.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:05.530
So statement number one-- so
integers between r and s, but

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.090
not including, remember,
not including.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.180
So statement number one
tells us that r minus

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.990
s is equal to 10.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:23.020
Now this is an interesting
question because if we knew

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.300
that r and s were integers then
we could just pick. r

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:33.110
minus s is, maybe r is equal
to 11 and s is equal to 1.

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.460
And then if you actually just
want me to write it out you

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:42.420
could say, well, 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.160
How many integers are between
the two and not

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.540
equaling the two?

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:51.500
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, right?

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.270
But that's if we assume that r
and s are integers and this

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.650
would work for any two sets of
integers that are 10 apart.

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.390
But what happens if we do it
a little bit differently?

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:06.820
What happens if we say that
this is 1.1, 2.1,

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.260
3.1-- oh no, sorry.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.820
What if it's between
1.1 and 11.1?

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:17.000
So if it's 1.1 is r-- oh no,
let me write it this way.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.140
What if r was 11.1 and
s was equal to 1.1?

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.030
Then what are the integers
between them but not equal?

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:31.550
So if you start at 1.1 you would
have 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:36.750
8, 9, 10-- and now 11 would be
included because 11 would

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.320
still be less than r-- 10, 11.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:44.750
So now you have 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.410
So statement number one is
actually not enough because

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:48.870
they didn't tell us that
r and s are integers.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.580
If r and s were integers
then the answer would

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.440
be 9 in this case.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.620
But if r and s are not
integers then the

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.020
answer could be 10.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.590
So statement number one alone
is not enough, the answer

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.960
could be 9 or 10.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.130
OK, what does statement
number two do for us.

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:06.400
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.802
Statement number two.

00:07:08.802 --> 00:07:10.530
This is an interesting
problem.

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:17.280
There are 9 integers between,
but not including, r plus 1

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.460
and s plus 1.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:20.790
OK.

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:21.780
So this is interesting.

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.460
So they're telling us that there
are 9 integers between r

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:25.920
plus 1 and s plus 1.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.830
So, I mean, actually just
looking at it, inspection, you

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.450
could say, oh, well then
there are 9 integers

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:31.320
between r and s.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.380
And they say but
not including.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:33.230
So this is enough.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.850
This alone is sufficient and
you don't need statement

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:36.310
number one.

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:38.710
Statement number one actually
doesn't get you anywhere.

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.510
So let me prove to you that if
there are 9 integers between r

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:45.945
plus 1 and s plus 1-- Well,
think of it this way: if there

00:07:45.945 --> 00:07:51.370
are 9 integers between r plus 1
an s plus 1, if you subtract

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:55.690
1-- so s is one of the one's
that are between-- now I want

00:07:55.690 --> 00:08:04.480
to make sure I do this right--
Let me think of a good way for

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.790
me to prove it to you.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:07.270
Well, I'll just do it
with an example.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:15.440
So let's say that the example
is 11 and 1, right?

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.110
This isn't a proof but I just
want to give you the

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:18.370
intuition, right?

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:22.500
So if r is 11 and s is 1, so
then you would have 12-- well,

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:23.560
I don't want to do
it that way.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.390
The easiest way to think about
it is, it doesn't matter how

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:31.420
much you are adding-- if you
add the same amount to both

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:35.700
the bottom of the range and the
top of the range it should

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.990
not change the total
number of integers

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:40.020
that are between them.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:43.429
So there would also be 9
integers between r minus

00:08:43.429 --> 00:08:46.010
1 and s minus 1.

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:48.800
You're just shifting the range
along the number line but

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.350
you're not going to actually
change the number of integers

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:52.160
in between them.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.280
So if they're 9 integers between
r plus 1 and s plus 1,

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.570
there's going to be 9 integers
between r and s.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:01.170
So two is all you need.

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.090
Hopefully that's a satisfactory
explanation.

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.050
I didn't want to go into
something rigorous when we're

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:08.460
trying to imbue you with
a sense of urgency.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.090
See if I have time for
the next problem.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:19.030
OK, 62.

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:23.330
What is the number of members of
club x who are at least 35

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:26.060
years of age.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:29.970
So number who's age is at least
35, so it's greater than

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:30.920
or equal to 35.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.590
The number who's age is true.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.740
OK.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:37.700
They tell us statement number
one, exactly 3/4 of the

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:42.880
members of club x are under
35 years of age.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:50.130
So 3/4 are less than 35.

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:55.490
That is fair enough but that
doesn't tell us the number

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:57.410
that are at least 35.

00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:59.290
This tells us the percentage.

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:06.840
This tells us that 1/4 above or
we say 1/4 greater than or

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.880
equal to 35.

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:15.610
1/4 of total members greater
than or equal to 35.

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:17.250
So it tells us proportion
but it doesn't tell

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:18.300
us the total amount.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:22.240
And I just got the 1/4 from 3/4
are less than 35, 1/4 are

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.350
going to be greater than or
equal to 35 years of age.

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:27.030
So one by itself doesn't
help us.

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.610
Let's see what two
does for us.

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:32.670
The 64 women-- am I reading
the same problem?

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:36.370
OK, yeah-- the 64 women in club
x constitute 40% of the

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:37.740
club's membership.

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:38.690
OK.

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:43.725
So 64 is equal to 40% of
the total membership.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.980
Now we're set, right?

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.490
Because we can use this equation
to figure out the

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:51.860
total membership.

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.380
Call it t for total.

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:57.310
t is going to be equal
to 64 divided by 0.4.

00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:59.840
They just told us that
essentially 64 is 40% percent

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:00.190
of the total.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:01.740
They said it's the women
and all that.

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:04.960
But they could've just told us
that 64 is 40% of the total.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.830
So then you can solve
for the total.

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:09.220
And then you substitute that
here and you say 1/4 of the

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:13.050
total are 35 five years or older
and you get what we were

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:14.440
trying to solve for.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:22.800
And so the answer is 1/4 times
64/0.4, and whatever that is,

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:23.900
you can put it in
your calculator.

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.500
But all we had to care is that
when you use both of these

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:30.500
equations combined, you're able
to solve for the number

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.180
that are greater than or
equal to 35 years old.

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.530
And each statement alone isn't
sufficient, so you need both

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:36.240
statements.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.470
And that is C, both statements
together are sufficient.

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:41.310
See you in the next video.
