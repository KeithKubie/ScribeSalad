explanation with that random result so

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880
explanation with that random result so

if I flip a quantum coin it comes out

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250
if I flip a quantum coin it comes out
 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.779
if I flip a quantum coin it comes out
heads or tails and I see heads now the

00:00:33.779 --> 00:00:33.789
heads or tails and I see heads now the
 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:35.880

strange thing is the mathematics says I

strange thing is the mathematics says I
 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.310
strange thing is the mathematics says I
should see heads and tails so it's

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320
should see heads and tails so it's
 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.049
should see heads and tails so it's
always been the mystery of why I see one

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059
always been the mystery of why I see one
 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.599

or the other the proposition is that
 

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:45.840
or the other the proposition is that
actually that the coin does come up

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850
actually that the coin does come up
 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.930
actually that the coin does come up
heads and tails but it comes up heads in

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940
heads and tails but it comes up heads in
 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.729

universe so the idea of different

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649
universe so the idea of different
 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:56.430

universes of parallel universes is a way

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440
universes of parallel universes is a way
 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.469
universes of parallel universes is a way
to make sense of kind of the

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:58.479
to make sense of kind of the
 

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:00.090

multiplicity the outcomes that are
observed in quantum mechanics and people

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609
observed in quantum mechanics and people
 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:04.590
observed in quantum mechanics and people
have proposed this would be a way to

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600
have proposed this would be a way to
 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.880
have proposed this would be a way to
actually kind of get rid of the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890
actually kind of get rid of the
 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.800
actually kind of get rid of the
nonlocality that the nonlocality the

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810
nonlocality that the nonlocality the

spooky action at a distance is actually

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090
spooky action at a distance is actually
 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.429
spooky action at a distance is actually
our kind of imperfect glimpse of a

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439
our kind of imperfect glimpse of a
 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.410
our kind of imperfect glimpse of a
multiverse of parallel universes and

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420
multiverse of parallel universes and
 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.600
multiverse of parallel universes and
that individually those universes all

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610
that individually those universes all
 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.459
that individually those universes all
behave completely locally no spooky

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:20.469
behave completely locally no spooky
 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:22.830
behave completely locally no spooky
action and I kind of actually have a lot

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840
action and I kind of actually have a lot
 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.300
action and I kind of actually have a lot
of sympathy for that position actually

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310
of sympathy for that position actually
 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.740
of sympathy for that position actually
it's kind of awesome to think that there

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750
it's kind of awesome to think that there
 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.080
it's kind of awesome to think that there
might be parallel universes not just out

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090
might be parallel universes not just out
 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.020
might be parallel universes not just out
there but actually in here that we could

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030
there but actually in here that we could
 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.330
there but actually in here that we could
be kind of just cheek-by-jowl with

be kind of just cheek-by-jowl with
 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.160
be kind of just cheek-by-jowl with
parallel universes all the time and we'd

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170
parallel universes all the time and we'd
 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.740
parallel universes all the time and we'd
never even sense them that any

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750
never even sense them that any
 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.209
never even sense them that any
measurement we make would cause the

it's kind of an amazing kind of

it's kind of an amazing kind of
 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.969
it's kind of an amazing kind of
conception of nature but I've kind of

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979
conception of nature but I've kind of
 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:49.889
conception of nature but I've kind of
gone off the idea as much as I kind of

gone off the idea as much as I kind of

reason is that I think that when you see

gravity there's a variety of contexts in

gravity there's a variety of contexts in
 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.510
gravity there's a variety of contexts in
which you see spooky actions

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520
which you see spooky actions
 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.120
which you see spooky actions
and those other contexts are harder to

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660
explain in this kind of parallel
 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.470
explain in this kind of parallel
universe scenario but what they really

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480
universe scenario but what they really
 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.780

seem to point to is that space and time

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790
seem to point to is that space and time
