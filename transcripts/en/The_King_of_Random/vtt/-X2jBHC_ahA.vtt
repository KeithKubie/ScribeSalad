00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.900
Hey whats up my friends!

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.700
its the next day and the silicone has cured

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.380
now i was a little worried

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.780
because last night before bed

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.780
I tested the silicone and it was still gooey

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.160
even after 12 hours of setting

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.760
now researching this catalyst

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.640
I found it that it takes 4 times longer for it to set

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.320
than the other catalysts we used in the past

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.420
which made me a little bit nervous that they wouldn't be ready today

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.140
but checking them out now, they are very firm

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.020
very rubbery

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.660
and so I am relatively confident

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.020
it's okay to cut them open and extract the brains

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.780
if not, I guess we're gonna find out what happens with uncured silicone

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.220
now yesterday when we poured the silicone, we had a bit of an issue

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.600
where the brain started rising

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.180
so we used these screws

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.980
to hold them down

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:34.720
i used a little but of ductape

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.840
just hold the silicone in until it set

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.780
and it looks like it did a really good job

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.840
so looking here you can see parts of the brain

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.900
still stuck to the bottom

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.680
that means our scwew did its job and it held the brain in place

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.300
the cool thing about using containers like this for our molds

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.160
the edes are slidely tapered downwards

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.340
so when we get the sides released

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.340
we should theoretically be able to turn it over

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.140
and have it plop right down on the table

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.020
*plop*

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:57.120
yeah

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.740
look what I have created

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.080
brain molds

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.960
huh

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.660
kinda looks like a giant mochi

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.440
*laughs*

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.360
so cool

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.400
our big silicone blocks

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.180
are out of the molds

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.300
it looks like there pritty firm

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.200
so I am relatively confident

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.780
we are gonna get a good brain mold today

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.340
so lets grab some paper towel and an Exacto knife

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.740
and set our minds free

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.100
ewww

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.420
there we go its very nice

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.640
oh yummy, bits of brain stuck on there

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.200
Ha

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.220
yeagh?

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.080
*laughs*

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.720
I think some of that flew in my mouth

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.180
so, I spent a good deal of time cutting this thing now

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.820
I have made 5 different incisions

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.260
where we can peel this all away

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.620
at this point, I think

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.260
we may be able to reach down

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.600
and pull that sucker out

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.060
ehhhhh *laughs*

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.640
awww yea there we go

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.720
mostly recoverd

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.080
it looks like

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.560
this little piece at the back here

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.840
got choped off

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.500
thats still inside

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.780
wich means we need to cut those little

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.020
strands that a holding it back

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.460
because when we cast anything else

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.400
it ganna follow the same pattern

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.620
and we don't want our chocolate

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.520
or gummies to be breaking

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.820
ehhhhh

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.820
lets see if i can piece this thing back together

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.820
it's like a puzzle!

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.820
it's like a brain teaser

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.820
this is your brain

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.820
this is your brain on silicone

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.820
my eyes are watering, my nose

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.820
burning, i thing that's the formaldehyde bleeding

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.820
through, OK this is where it gets a little nasty

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.820
*laughs* we can look down inside

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.820
and look at that

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.820
that' pretty hard work

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.820
you can tell that because i'm sweating

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.820
ah ya it's getting a lot easier now

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.480
were almost there the end is it sight

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.120
aw man that is slightly disturbing

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.040
you know what this thing kind of reminds me of?

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.380
are those old ninja turtle cartoons remember that character krang who has a little like a little pink brain that looks a lot like krang I think

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.400
that's a little disturbing

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.320
eww brains

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.420
so there we did it guys

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.880
we successfully got our brain out

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.720
we got a cool rubber  silicone mold

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.900
the only problem with it is that if you look on the inside its got all these disgusting gooey bits of brain and blood vessels

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.600
stuck to the inside and also smells bad too

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.600
so i got a big bucket of dish soap and bleach

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.600
we are going to scrub these things and let them soak for about a hour or two

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.780
and while we are waiting we are going to answer a comment request from Andy Varcho

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.600
Andy asks "What would happen to a brain in a vacuum chamber? Would you be able to get a cows brain?"

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.040
well not only can we Andy we actually did.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.040
these are genuine real cow brains

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.020
and we are going to put them inside this vacuum chamber for you right now

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.000
I just noticed this is the brain that was floating

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
up in the silicon and i pressed it back down with my

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
finger and you can actually see the finger marks

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
the indentations in the brain from the pressure

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
i had to put on it

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
i was hoping that would re-inflate but apparently it doesn't.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.000
So Andy we are doing this for you

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.260
we got our brain set in the vacuum chamber

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
all we have to do now is switch on the pump

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.440
and see if anything happens

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.440
here we go

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
I don't really see anything happening.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.680
Ok lets exhaust it and see if anything happens

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.680
exhausting the brain in 3, 2 , 1

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.360
Oh actually it did deflate a little bit.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.100
well that was suprising

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:01.760
Lets try it again and watch this

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.560
Alright that is at full pressure lets let the air back in

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.720
In 3, 2

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.980
yea we can see it shrink down a little bit

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.840
it's not anything super impressive but it is something

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:14.640
yep very very minimal

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.400
So i am glad we didn't spend a whole lot of time on that

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.700
But don't worry Andy i'm still sending you twenty-five bucks(Dollars)

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.700
because it was a worthy experiment and you never

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:22.200
know unless you try

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.260
So now we know

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.760
So brain in a vacuum chamber doesn't really do much

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.760
And i don't have much other use for these brains

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.620
so i think i am just going to take my finger

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.300
and stick it down inside to see what kind of experience

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.400
i can gleam from that

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.000
Now i am just running my finger over the top of the brain

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
which i haven't done yet because i didn't want to disrupt

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.240
this for the silicon mold

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:40.600
And

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.600
It kind of just feels like (uh) chicken actually

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.960
it feels like bumpy chicken

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.440
but you can see now that it doesn't have that top

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.500
membrane on we can actually pull these crevices apart

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.500
and amazingly the silicon didn't leak down inside

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.160
So it must have been relatively tight

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.580
Now if i get down inside one of these crevices here

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.820
push down inside

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.100
it's kind of firm

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.360
it's kind of like pushing a finger through a piece of rubber

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.900
its starting to give way And...

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.040
I'm out the otherside

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.020
right there

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.020
Alright

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.200
Well that was interesting now we can just break

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.200
this away and see what the interior(inside) looks like

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.360
Kind of looks like a mushroom

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.760
I mean i like mushrooms and i hope this doesn't gross

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.060
anyone else out who does but

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.320
look at that cross-section. That looks a lot like a mushroom

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.920
And surprisingly the texture is much like a mushroom

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:34.500
as well

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.880
wow it makes me wonder how smart mushrooms must be

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.240
what i have always wanted to do is take one of these brains

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.640
and just split it in half

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.220
and this is what it looks like

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:46.600
how interesting

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.000
how much does it take to break it

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.360
not much ok

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.640
so this is kind of just like one giant mushroom

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:53.760
and thats what it feels like

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.780
its got the sponginess of a mushroom stem

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.060
the top parts here feel a lot like a mushroom

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.620
and you can kind of see its even kind of slimy

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.000
ok so this brain is destroyed and we have learned a lot

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.020
i'm just going to take this and squish it just because we can

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:07.920
oh goodness

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.640
its like play-doh

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.560
it doesn't stick like play-doh but it squish like play-doh

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.480
oh wow

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:17.880
huh

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.260
that is really interesting

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.320
because there is nothing left you just squish it and it completely  pulverizes

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.340
look at that

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.400
it is kind of disturbing isn't it

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.640
Wow...So...

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.680
(Laughs)

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.180
yeah i am going to get grossed out now

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:35.600
i think i am done playing with brains

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.060
that was enough that was fun very educational but i am done

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.060
and i need to change my gloves

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.080
so here we are guys i feel like we learned a lot about the brain today

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.060
and not only that we have some cool rubber molds that I

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.560
am going to let soak in bleach over night and make sure they

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.560
are completely clean because i have a higher and better use

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.340
for them coming right up. I actually pre-made some purple

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.680
and green gummy that we are going to melt down and pour

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.740
into these molds simultaneously to see if we can make ourselves

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.160
some purple and green gummy zombie brains

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.260
how cool would that be

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.820
that will be coming up in the next video and of course a big

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.020
thanks to Andy Varcho for requesting a brain in a vacuum chamber

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.320
go ahead and check your YouTube inbox i am sending you twenty-five bucks(dollars)

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.020
Thanks for joining me for this experiment, i will be looking

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.740
for you in the next Project. Talk to you then

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.920
ho grants getting weird out

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:20.780
(slam sound effect)

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.780
