00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.260
We just took an initial look at
how we can use Aria rolls and

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.770
properties to specify the semantics for
a particular element.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.020
However, we should remember that native
HTML elements have implicit semantics.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.450
For example, input type= checkbox
implicitly has a role of checkbox.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.080
This means two things.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.730
Firstly, there is usually no need
to redefine default semantics and

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.260
input type equals checkbox does not
need an extra role equals checkbox

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.790
attribute to be announced as a checkbox.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.410
We'll come to an exception
to this rule later on.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.610
Secondly, sudden HTML elements have
restrictions on what ARIA role and

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.770
attribute values may be
used effectively on them.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.535
Most of the time unless you're
doing something pretty weird,

00:00:43.535 --> 00:00:44.950
you won't run into any issues.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.787
But the ARIA in HTML spec has a table
explaining what ARIA may and may not be

00:00:49.787 --> 00:00:54.326
used with each type of HTML element
in case you want to get creative.

00:00:54.326 --> 00:00:59.308
For example a text field input type =
"text" may not have a role attribute

00:00:59.308 --> 00:01:00.030
applied.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.770
Speaking of implicit semantics,

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.750
we mentioned earlier that
HTML landmark elements

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.300
may be used to help assistive technology
users to find their way around the page.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.500
ARIA also offers a set of landmark and
document structure roles.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.590
Many of these are redundant
with HTML5 semantic elements.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.830
But depending on what browser
versions you need to support,

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.380
it may be necessary in some cases to
use both an HTML5 semantic element and

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.548
a redundant ARIA role.

00:01:25.548 --> 00:01:28.475
For example,,

00:01:28.475 --> 00:01:33.180
breaking the general rule of not
redefining default semantics.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.430
Because the default semantics may
not be fully supported in this case.
