the next best predictor of lifetime

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070
the next best predictor of lifetime
 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.460
the next best predictor of lifetime
success is conscientiousness well so and

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470
success is conscientiousness well so and
 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.889

conscientiousness say orderliness and
 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.480
conscientiousness say orderliness and
and industriousness the better predictor

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490
and industriousness the better predictor
 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.339
and industriousness the better predictor
is industriousness so the question is

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349
is industriousness so the question is
 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.600
is industriousness so the question is
well what can you do about your

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610
well what can you do about your

well what can you do about your
industriousness and the answer to that

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379
industriousness and the answer to that
 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.010
industriousness and the answer to that
is well that's kind of rough too because

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020
is well that's kind of rough too because
 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.910
is well that's kind of rough too because
there's a strong genetic component but

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920
there's a strong genetic component but
 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.950
there's a strong genetic component but
you can work on micro habits with

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960
you can work on micro habits with
 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.689

think the best micro habits this is
 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.620
think the best micro habits this is
partly to do with these future authoring

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630
partly to do with these future authoring
 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.359
partly to do with these future authoring
program processes I think the best thing

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369
program processes I think the best thing
 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.440
program processes I think the best thing
you can do with regards to your

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450
you can do with regards to your
 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.870
you can do with regards to your
conscientiousness is to set up some aims

for yourself goals that you actually
 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.459
for yourself goals that you actually
value and the future authoring program

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469
value and the future authoring program
 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.010
value and the future authoring program
helps people do that and basically it

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020
helps people do that and basically it
 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.979
helps people do that and basically it
does a situational analysis of it helps

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989
does a situational analysis of it helps
 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.810
does a situational analysis of it helps
you do a situational analysis of your

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820

alcoholism for example wipes out you
 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.929
alcoholism for example wipes out you
know five to ten percent of people so

know five to ten percent of people so
 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.330
know five to ten percent of people so
you want to keep that under control and

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340
you want to keep that under control and
 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.170
you want to keep that under control and
then and then so maybe you know you you

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180
then and then so maybe you know you you
 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.999

what you would like your life to be and
that associates the so the goal once the

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340
that associates the so the goal once the
 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.860
that associates the so the goal once the
goal is established and then you break

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870
goal is established and then you break
 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.980
goal is established and then you break
down the goal

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990
down the goal
 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.720
down the goal
into micro processes that you can

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730
into micro processes that you can
 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.940
into micro processes that you can
implement the micro process has become

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950
implement the micro process has become
 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.000
implement the micro process has become
rewarding in proportion in relation to

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010
rewarding in proportion in relation to
 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.330
rewarding in proportion in relation to
their causal association with the goal

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340
their causal association with the goal
 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.030
their causal association with the goal
and that tangles in your your incentive

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040
and that tangles in your your incentive
 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.530
and that tangles in your your incentive
reward system you know we talked about

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540
reward system you know we talked about
 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.540
reward system you know we talked about
the dopaminergic incentive reward system

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550
the dopaminergic incentive reward system
 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:31.620
the dopaminergic incentive reward system
and that's the thing that keeps you

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630
and that's the thing that keeps you
 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.660
and that's the thing that keeps you
moving forward and the way it works is

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670
moving forward and the way it works is
 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.600
moving forward and the way it works is
that it works better if it produces

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610
that it works better if it produces
 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.790
that it works better if it produces
positive emotion when it can see you

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800
positive emotion when it can see you
 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.340
positive emotion when it can see you
moving towards a valued goal okay well

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350
moving towards a valued goal okay well
 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.380
moving towards a valued goal okay well
what's the implication of that better

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390
what's the implication of that better
 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.570
what's the implication of that better
have a valued goal because otherwise you

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580
have a valued goal because otherwise you
 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.130
have a valued goal because otherwise you
can't get any positive motivation

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140
can't get any positive motivation
 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.260
can't get any positive motivation
working out and so the more valuable the

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270
working out and so the more valuable the
 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.630
working out and so the more valuable the
goal in principle the more the micro

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640
goal in principle the more the micro
 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.670
goal in principle the more the micro
process is associated with that goal

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680
process is associated with that goal
 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.040
process is associated with that goal
start to take on a positive charge and

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050
start to take on a positive charge and
 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.080
start to take on a positive charge and
so what that means is well you get up in

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090
so what that means is well you get up in
 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.640
so what that means is well you get up in
the morning and you're excited about the

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650
the morning and you're excited about the
 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.690
the morning and you're excited about the
day you're ready to go

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700
day you're ready to go
 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.550
day you're ready to go
and so as far as I can tell what you do

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560
and so as far as I can tell what you do
 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.480
and so as far as I can tell what you do
is you specify your long term ideal

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490
is you specify your long term ideal
 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.070
is you specify your long term ideal
maybe you also specify a place you want

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080
maybe you also specify a place you want
 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.270
maybe you also specify a place you want
to stay the hell away from so that

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280
to stay the hell away from so that
 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.520
to stay the hell away from so that
you're terrified to fail as well as

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530
you're terrified to fail as well as
 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.350
you're terrified to fail as well as
excited about succeeding because that's

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360
excited about succeeding because that's
 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.650
excited about succeeding because that's
also useful you specify your goal you do

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660
also useful you specify your goal you do
 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.260
also useful you specify your goal you do
that you do that in some sense as a

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270
that you do that in some sense as a
 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.970
that you do that in some sense as a
unique individual you want to you want

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980
unique individual you want to you want
 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.670
unique individual you want to you want
to specify goals that make you say oh if

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680
to specify goals that make you say oh if
 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.070
to specify goals that make you say oh if
that could happen as a consequence of my

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080
that could happen as a consequence of my
 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.870
that could happen as a consequence of my
efforts it would clearly be worthwhile

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880
efforts it would clearly be worthwhile
 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.300
efforts it would clearly be worthwhile
because the question always is why do

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310
because the question always is why do
 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.430
because the question always is why do
something because doing nothing is easy

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440
something because doing nothing is easy
 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.570
something because doing nothing is easy
you just sit there and you don't do

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580
you just sit there and you don't do
 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.730
you just sit there and you don't do
anything that's real easy the question

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740
anything that's real easy the question
 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.260
anything that's real easy the question
is why would you ever do anything and

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270
is why would you ever do anything and
 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.240
is why would you ever do anything and
the answer that has to be because you've

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250
the answer that has to be because you've
 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.640
the answer that has to be because you've
determined by some means that it's

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650
determined by some means that it's
 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.890
determined by some means that it's
worthwhile and then the next question

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900
worthwhile and then the next question
 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.210
worthwhile and then the next question
might be well where should you look for

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220
might be well where should you look for
 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.280
might be well where should you look for
worthwhile things and one would be well

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290
worthwhile things and one would be well
 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.930
worthwhile things and one would be well
you could consult your own temperament

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940
you could consult your own temperament
 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.030
you could consult your own temperament
and now there would be well you kind of

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040
and now there would be well you kind of
 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.400
and now there would be well you kind of
look at how look at what it is that

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410
look at how look at what it is that
 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.130
look at how look at what it is that
people accrue that's valuable across the

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140
people accrue that's valuable across the
 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.040
people accrue that's valuable across the
lifespan look look what so you do a

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050
lifespan look look what so you do a
 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.020
lifespan look look what so you do a
structural analysis of the sub

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030
structural analysis of the sub
 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.700
structural analysis of the sub
components of human existence and

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:02.710
components of human existence and
 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.310
components of human existence and
already did that you need a family you

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320
already did that you need a family you
 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.810
already did that you need a family you
need friends like you don't need to have

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820
need friends like you don't need to have
 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.130
need friends like you don't need to have
all these things but you better have

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140
all these things but you better have
 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.910
all these things but you better have
most of them

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920
most of them
 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.700
most of them
family friends career educational goals

family friends career educational goals
 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.050
family friends career educational goals
plans for you know time outside of work

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060
plans for you know time outside of work
 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.860
plans for you know time outside of work
attention to your mental and physical

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870
attention to your mental and physical
 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.780
attention to your mental and physical
health etc you know those are that's

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790
health etc you know those are that's
 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.750
health etc you know those are that's
what life is about and if you don't have

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760
what life is about and if you don't have
 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.640
what life is about and if you don't have
any of those things well then all you've

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650
any of those things well then all you've
 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.409
any of those things well then all you've
got left is misery and suffering so

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419
got left is misery and suffering so
 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.190
got left is misery and suffering so
that's that's bad

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200
that's that's bad
 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.140
that's that's bad
that's a bad deal for you so so once you

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150
that's a bad deal for you so so once you
 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.970
that's a bad deal for you so so once you
but once you set up that that goal

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980
but once you set up that that goal
 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.890
but once you set up that that goal
structure let's say and that's really in

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900
structure let's say and that's really in
 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.110
structure let's say and that's really in
many in many ways that's what you should

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120
many in many ways that's what you should
 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.880
many in many ways that's what you should
be doing at universities is that's

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890
be doing at universities is that's
 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.140
be doing at universities is that's
exactly what you should be doing is

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150
exactly what you should be doing is
 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.150
exactly what you should be doing is
trying to figure out who it is that

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160
trying to figure out who it is that
 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.530
trying to figure out who it is that
you're trying to be right and you aim at

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540
you're trying to be right and you aim at
 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.480
you're trying to be right and you aim at
that and then use everything you learn

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490
that and then use everything you learn
 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.210
that and then use everything you learn
as a means of building that person that

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220
as a means of building that person that
 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.580
as a means of building that person that
you want to be and and I really mean

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590
you want to be and and I really mean
 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.620
you want to be and and I really mean
want to be I don't mean should be even

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630
want to be I don't mean should be even
 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.060
want to be I don't mean should be even
those things those things are going to

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070
those things those things are going to
 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.070
those things those things are going to
overlap and it's important to

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080
overlap and it's important to
 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.570
overlap and it's important to
distinguish between those because that's

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580
distinguish between those because that's
 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.160
distinguish between those because that's
partly and this is back down to the

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170
partly and this is back down to the
 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:04.780
partly and this is back down to the
micro routine analysis so I started

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790
micro routine analysis so I started
 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:05.680
micro routine analysis so I started
saying well you're going to try to make

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690
saying well you're going to try to make
 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.450
saying well you're going to try to make
yourself more industrious okay number

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460
yourself more industrious okay number
 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.790
yourself more industrious okay number
one specify your damn goals because how

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800
one specify your damn goals because how
 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.780
one specify your damn goals because how
are you going to hit something if you

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790
are you going to hit something if you
 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.280
are you going to hit something if you
don't know what it is that isn't going

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.290
don't know what it is that isn't going
 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.350
don't know what it is that isn't going
to happen and often people won't specify

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360
to happen and often people won't specify
 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.970
to happen and often people won't specify
their goals too because they don't like

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:15.980
their goals too because they don't like
 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.310
their goals too because they don't like
to specify conditions for failure so if

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320
to specify conditions for failure so if
 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.930
to specify conditions for failure so if
you keep yourself all vague and foggy

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940
you keep yourself all vague and foggy
 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.270
you keep yourself all vague and foggy
which is real easy because that's just a

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280
which is real easy because that's just a
 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.070
which is real easy because that's just a
matter of not doing as well then you

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080
matter of not doing as well then you
 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.140
matter of not doing as well then you
don't know when you fail and people

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150
don't know when you fail and people
 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.520
don't know when you fail and people
might say well I really don't want to

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530
might say well I really don't want to
 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.170
might say well I really don't want to
know when I fail because that's painful

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180
know when I fail because that's painful
 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.480
know when I fail because that's painful
so I'll keep myself blind about when I

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490
so I'll keep myself blind about when I
 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.730
so I'll keep myself blind about when I
fail that's fine except you'll fail all

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740
fail that's fine except you'll fail all
 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.680
fail that's fine except you'll fail all
the time then you just won't know it

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690
the time then you just won't know it
 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.690
the time then you just won't know it
until you failed so badly that you're

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.700
until you failed so badly that you're
 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.850
until you failed so badly that you're
done and that can easily happen by the

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860
done and that can easily happen by the
 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.660
done and that can easily happen by the
time you're 40 so so I would recommend

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:43.670
time you're 40 so so I would recommend
 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.010
time you're 40 so so I would recommend
that you don't let that happen

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020
that you don't let that happen
 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.630
that you don't let that happen
so that's willful blindness right you

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:46.640
so that's willful blindness right you
 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.790
so that's willful blindness right you
could have known but you chose not to

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800
could have known but you chose not to
 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.010
could have known but you chose not to
okay so once you get your goal structure

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020
okay so once you get your goal structure
 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.780
okay so once you get your goal structure
set up you think okay if I could have

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:52.790
set up you think okay if I could have
 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.850
set up you think okay if I could have
this life it looks like that might be

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860
this life it looks like that might be
 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.590
this life it looks like that might be
worth living despite the fact that it's

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.600
worth living despite the fact that it's
 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.750
worth living despite the fact that it's
going to be you know anxiety provoking

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760
going to be you know anxiety provoking
 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.040
going to be you know anxiety provoking
and threatening and there's going to be

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050
and threatening and there's going to be
 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.750
and threatening and there's going to be
some suffering and loss involved in all

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760
some suffering and loss involved in all
 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.930
some suffering and loss involved in all
of that obviously the goal is to have a

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:04.940
of that obviously the goal is to have a
 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.300
of that obviously the goal is to have a
vision for your life such that all

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310
vision for your life such that all
 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.270
vision for your life such that all
things considered that justifies your

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:10.280
things considered that justifies your
 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.930
things considered that justifies your
effort okay so then what do you do well

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940
effort okay so then what do you do well
 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.820
effort okay so then what do you do well
then then you turn down to the micro

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830
then then you turn down to the micro
 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.230
then then you turn down to the micro
routine it's like okay well this is what

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240
routine it's like okay well this is what
 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.720
routine it's like okay well this is what
I'm aiming for how does that instantiate

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:19.730
I'm aiming for how does that instantiate
 

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.060
I'm aiming for how does that instantiate
itself day to day week to week month to

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.070
itself day to day week to week month to
 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.860
itself day to day week to week month to
month and that's where something like a

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:23.870
month and that's where something like a
 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.750
month and that's where something like a
schedule can be unbelievably useful

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:25.760
schedule can be unbelievably useful
 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.880
schedule can be unbelievably useful
Google Calendar it's like make a damn

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:27.890
Google Calendar it's like make a damn
 

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:29.890
Google Calendar it's like make a damn
schedule and stick to it

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:29.900
schedule and stick to it
 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.420
schedule and stick to it
okay so what's the rule with the

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:31.430
okay so what's the rule with the
 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.840
okay so what's the rule with the
schedule it's not a bloody prison that's

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:34.850
schedule it's not a bloody prison that's
 

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:36.310
schedule it's not a bloody prison that's
the first thing that people do wrong is

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:36.320
the first thing that people do wrong is
 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.750
the first thing that people do wrong is
well I don't like to follow a schedule

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:37.760
well I don't like to follow a schedule
 

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.940
well I don't like to follow a schedule
looks like well what kind of schedule

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:39.950
looks like well what kind of schedule
 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.170
looks like well what kind of schedule
are you setting up

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:41.180
are you setting up
 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.210
are you setting up
I have to do this then I have to do this

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:43.220
I have to do this then I have to do this
 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.100
I have to do this then I have to do this
then I have to do this you know and then

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.110
then I have to do this you know and then
 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.630
then I have to do this you know and then
I just go play video games because who

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:46.640
I just go play video games because who
 

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.220
I just go play video games because who
wants to do all these things that I have

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:48.230
wants to do all these things that I have
 

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.800
wants to do all these things that I have
to do it's like wrong set the damn

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:50.810
to do it's like wrong set the damn
 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.290
to do it's like wrong set the damn
schedule up so that you have the day you

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:53.300
schedule up so that you have the day you
 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.990
schedule up so that you have the day you
want that's the trick it's like okay

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000
want that's the trick it's like okay
 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.820
want that's the trick it's like okay
I've got tomorrow if I was going to set

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:57.830
I've got tomorrow if I was going to set
 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.950
I've got tomorrow if I was going to set
it up so the best possible day I could

00:06:59.950 --> 00:06:59.960
it up so the best possible day I could
 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:04.000
it up so the best possible day I could
have practically speaking what would it

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:04.010
have practically speaking what would it
 

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:06.070
have practically speaking what would it
look like well then you schedule that

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.080
look like well then you schedule that
 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.600
look like well then you schedule that
and obviously there's a bit of

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:07.610
and obviously there's a bit of
 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.190
and obviously there's a bit of
responsibility that's going to go along

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:09.200
responsibility that's going to go along
 

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.840
responsibility that's going to go along
with that because if you have any sense

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:10.850
with that because if you have any sense
 

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:12.550
with that because if you have any sense
one of the things that you're going to

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560
one of the things that you're going to
 

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.440
one of the things that you're going to
insist upon is that at the end of the

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:14.450
insist upon is that at the end of the
 

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.570
insist upon is that at the end of the
day you're not in worse shape than you

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:16.580
day you're not in worse shape than you
 

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.610
day you're not in worse shape than you
were that then at the beginning of the

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:18.620
were that then at the beginning of the
 

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:19.120
were that then at the beginning of the
day right

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:19.130
day right
 

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.670
day right
that's a stupid day if you have a bunch

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:21.680
that's a stupid day if you have a bunch
 

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.230
that's a stupid day if you have a bunch
of those in a row you just dig you know

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:23.240
of those in a row you just dig you know
 

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.730
of those in a row you just dig you know
you dig yourself a hole and then you

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:24.740
you dig yourself a hole and then you
 

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.920
you dig yourself a hole and then you
bury yourself in it's like sorry that's

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:26.930
bury yourself in it's like sorry that's
 

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:28.990
bury yourself in it's like sorry that's
just not a good strategy it's a bad

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:29.000
just not a good strategy it's a bad
 

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.650
just not a good strategy it's a bad
strategy

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:29.660
strategy
 

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.680
strategy
so maybe 20% of your day has to be

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:32.690
so maybe 20% of your day has to be
 

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.660
so maybe 20% of your day has to be
responsibility and obligation or maybe

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:34.670
responsibility and obligation or maybe
 

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:36.190
responsibility and obligation or maybe
it's more than that depending on how far

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:36.200
it's more than that depending on how far
 

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.470
it's more than that depending on how far
behind you are but even that you can you

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:38.480
behind you are but even that you can you
 

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.180
behind you are but even that you can you
can ask yourself okay well I've got

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:40.190
can ask yourself okay well I've got
 

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.010
can ask yourself okay well I've got
these responsibilities I have to

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:42.020
these responsibilities I have to
 

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.530
these responsibilities I have to
schedule the damn things in what's the

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:44.540
schedule the damn things in what's the
 

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.900
schedule the damn things in what's the
right ratio of responsibility to reward

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:46.910
right ratio of responsibility to reward
 

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:49.060
right ratio of responsibility to reward
and you can ask yourself that just like

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:49.070
and you can ask yourself that just like
 

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:50.440
and you can ask yourself that just like
you'd ago she ate with someone who is

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:50.450
you'd ago she ate with someone who is
 

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:51.790
you'd ago she ate with someone who is
working for you it's like okay you got

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:51.800
working for you it's like okay you got
 

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.410
working for you it's like okay you got
to work tomorrow

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:52.420

okay so I want you to work tomorrow and
 

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.350
okay so I want you to work tomorrow and
you might say okay well what are you

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:56.360
you might say okay well what are you
 

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.810
you might say okay well what are you
going to do for me that makes it likely

00:07:58.810 --> 00:07:58.820
going to do for me that makes it likely
 

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.790
going to do for me that makes it likely
that I'll work for you well you could

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:00.800
that I'll work for you well you could
 

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.520
that I'll work for you well you could
ask yourself that you know maybe you do

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:03.530
ask yourself that you know maybe you do
 

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:05.890
ask yourself that you know maybe you do
an hour of responsibility and then you

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:05.900
an hour of responsibility and then you
 

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.660
an hour of responsibility and then you
play a video game for 15 minutes I don't

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:07.670
play a video game for 15 minutes I don't
 

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:09.550
play a video game for 15 minutes I don't
know whatever turns your crank man but

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:09.560
know whatever turns your crank man but
 

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.890
know whatever turns your crank man but
you know you have to negotiate with

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:11.900
you know you have to negotiate with
 

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.890
you know you have to negotiate with
yourself and not tyrannize yourself like

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:14.900
yourself and not tyrannize yourself like
 

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.780
yourself and not tyrannize yourself like
you're negotiating with someone that you

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:16.790
you're negotiating with someone that you
 

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:18.340
you're negotiating with someone that you
care for that you would like to be

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:18.350
care for that you would like to be
 

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.380
care for that you would like to be
productive and have a good life and and

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:20.390
productive and have a good life and and
 

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:22.120
productive and have a good life and and
that's how you make the schedule it's

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:22.130
that's how you make the schedule it's
 

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:23.500
that's how you make the schedule it's
like and then you look today and you

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:23.510
like and then you look today and you
 

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:25.030
like and then you look today and you
think well if I had that day that'd be

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:25.040
think well if I had that day that'd be
 

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.760
think well if I had that day that'd be
good great you know I knew you're

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:27.770
good great you know I knew you're
 

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:29.230
good great you know I knew you're
useless and horrible so you'll probably

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:29.240
useless and horrible so you'll probably
 

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.750
useless and horrible so you'll probably
only hit it with about 70% accuracy but

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:31.760
only hit it with about 70% accuracy but
 

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.690
only hit it with about 70% accuracy but
that beats the hell out of zero right

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:34.700
that beats the hell out of zero right
 

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.090
that beats the hell out of zero right
and if you hit it even with 50% accuracy

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:37.100
and if you hit it even with 50% accuracy
 

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:40.540
and if you hit it even with 50% accuracy
another rule is well aim for 51% the

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:40.550
another rule is well aim for 51% the
 

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:42.970
another rule is well aim for 51% the
next week or 50 and a half percent for

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:42.980
next week or 50 and a half percent for
 

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.550
next week or 50 and a half percent for
God's sake or because you're going to

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:45.560
God's sake or because you're going to
 

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.740
God's sake or because you're going to
hit that position where things start to

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:47.750
hit that position where things start to
 

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.930
hit that position where things start to
loop back positively and spiral you

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:49.940
loop back positively and spiral you
 

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:53.440
loop back positively and spiral you
upward and so so that's one way that you

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:53.450
upward and so so that's one way that you
 

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:54.850
upward and so so that's one way that you
can work on your conscientious

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:54.860
can work on your conscientious
 

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.280
can work on your conscientious
a plan of life you'd like to have and

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:57.290
a plan of life you'd like to have and
 

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:00.759
a plan of life you'd like to have and
and you do that partly by referring to

00:09:00.759 --> 00:09:00.769
and you do that partly by referring to
 

00:09:00.769 --> 00:09:02.380
and you do that partly by referring to
social norms that's more or less

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:02.390
social norms that's more or less
 

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:04.269
social norms that's more or less

rescuing your father from the belly of
 

00:09:04.279 --> 00:09:05.920
rescuing your father from the belly of

the whale but the way other way you do
 

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:07.540
the whale but the way other way you do
that is by having a little conversation

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:07.550
that is by having a little conversation
 

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:10.389
that is by having a little conversation
with yourself about as if you don't

00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:10.399
with yourself about as if you don't
 

00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:11.980

to do you must have noticed that it's
like you're a bad employee and a worse

00:09:20.199 --> 00:09:20.209
like you're a bad employee and a worse
 

00:09:20.209 --> 00:09:23.470
like you're a bad employee and a worse
boss and both of those work you know for

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:23.480
boss and both of those work you know for
 

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.090
boss and both of those work you know for
you you don't know what you want to do

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:25.100
you you don't know what you want to do
 

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.410
you you don't know what you want to do
and then when you tell yourself what to

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:26.420
and then when you tell yourself what to
 

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:27.610
and then when you tell yourself what to
do you don't do it anyways you should

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:27.620
do you don't do it anyways you should
 

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.710
do you don't do it anyways you should
fire yourself and find someone else to

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:29.720
fire yourself and find someone else to
 

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.800
fire yourself and find someone else to
be but but you know my point is is that

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:32.810
be but but you know my point is is that
 

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:34.840
be but but you know my point is is that
you have to understand that you're not

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:34.850
you have to understand that you're not
 

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:36.730
you have to understand that you're not
your own servant so to speak you're

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:36.740
your own servant so to speak you're
 

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:38.139
your own servant so to speak you're
someone that you have to negotiate with

00:09:38.139 --> 00:09:38.149
someone that you have to negotiate with
 

00:09:38.149 --> 00:09:41.050
someone that you have to negotiate with
and that's and you're someone that you

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:41.060
and that's and you're someone that you
 

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.060
and that's and you're someone that you
want to present the opportunity of

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:43.070
want to present the opportunity of
 

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.220
want to present the opportunity of
having a good life to and that's hard

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:45.230
having a good life to and that's hard
 

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:46.240
having a good life to and that's hard
for people because they don't like

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:46.250
for people because they don't like
 

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:48.910
for people because they don't like
themselves very much so you know they're

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:48.920
themselves very much so you know they're
 

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.759
themselves very much so you know they're
always like cracking the whip and then

00:09:50.759 --> 00:09:50.769
always like cracking the whip and then
 

00:09:50.769 --> 00:09:52.569
always like cracking the whip and then
procrastinating and cracking the whip

00:09:52.569 --> 00:09:52.579
procrastinating and cracking the whip
 

00:09:52.579 --> 00:09:54.130
procrastinating and cracking the whip
and then procrastinating and it's like

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:54.140
and then procrastinating and it's like
 

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:57.130
and then procrastinating and it's like
god it's so boring and such a pathetic

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:57.140
god it's so boring and such a pathetic
 

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:58.480
god it's so boring and such a pathetic
way of spending your time and you know

00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:58.490
way of spending your time and you know
 

00:09:58.490 --> 00:09:59.500
way of spending your time and you know
what that's like because you probably

00:09:59.500 --> 00:09:59.510
what that's like because you probably
 

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:01.810
what that's like because you probably
waste like six hours a day and I think

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:01.820
waste like six hours a day and I think
 

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:03.370
waste like six hours a day and I think
we did an economic calculation about

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:03.380
we did an economic calculation about
 

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.139
we did an economic calculation about
that a while back right your time is

00:10:05.139 --> 00:10:05.149
that a while back right your time is
 

00:10:05.149 --> 00:10:06.370
that a while back right your time is
probably worth 50 bucks an hour

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:06.380
probably worth 50 bucks an hour
 

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:08.470
probably worth 50 bucks an hour
something like that I mean you're not

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:08.480
something like that I mean you're not
 

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.480
something like that I mean you're not
getting paid that now but you're young

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:10.490
getting paid that now but you're young
 

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:13.509
getting paid that now but you're young
and so this is investment time and what

00:10:13.509 --> 00:10:13.519
and so this is investment time and what
 

00:10:13.519 --> 00:10:15.250
and so this is investment time and what
you do now is going to multiply its

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:15.260
you do now is going to multiply its
 

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.530
you do now is going to multiply its
effects in the future so so let's say

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:17.540
effects in the future so so let's say
 

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.240
effects in the future so so let's say
it's 50 bucks an hour which is perfectly

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:19.250
it's 50 bucks an hour which is perfectly
 

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:20.920
it's 50 bucks an hour which is perfectly
reasonable so if you weigh six hours a

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:20.930
reasonable so if you weigh six hours a
 

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:23.019
reasonable so if you weigh six hours a
day and you are then you're wasting

00:10:23.019 --> 00:10:23.029
day and you are then you're wasting
 

00:10:23.029 --> 00:10:25.660
day and you are then you're wasting
about $2,000 a week or about $100,000 a

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:25.670
about $2,000 a week or about $100,000 a
 

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:27.610
about $2,000 a week or about $100,000 a
year so like go ahead but that's what

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:27.620
year so like go ahead but that's what
 

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:29.620
year so like go ahead but that's what
it's costing you every hour and you need

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:29.630
it's costing you every hour and you need
 

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:31.780
it's costing you every hour and you need
to know what your damn time is worth so

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:31.790
to know what your damn time is worth so
 

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:33.600
to know what your damn time is worth so
let's say it's not 50 bucks it's 30

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:33.610
let's say it's not 50 bucks it's 30
 

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:35.920
let's say it's not 50 bucks it's 30
whatever maybe it's a hundred it's

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:35.930
whatever maybe it's a hundred it's
 

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:37.630
whatever maybe it's a hundred it's
somewhere in that range one of the

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:37.640
somewhere in that range one of the
 

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.310
somewhere in that range one of the
things you should be asking yourself is

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:39.320
things you should be asking yourself is
 

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.410
things you should be asking yourself is
when you spend an hour was that well

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:41.420
when you spend an hour was that well
 

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.810
when you spend an hour was that well
what have I paid someone 50 bucks to

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:43.820
what have I paid someone 50 bucks to
 

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:45.939
what have I paid someone 50 bucks to
have had that hour and if the answer is

00:10:45.939 --> 00:10:45.949
have had that hour and if the answer is
 

00:10:45.949 --> 00:10:47.560
have had that hour and if the answer is
no it's like well maybe you should do

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:47.570
no it's like well maybe you should do
 

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:49.630
no it's like well maybe you should do
something else with your time and it

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:49.640
something else with your time and it
 

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:50.949
something else with your time and it
depends on whether or not you think that

00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:50.959
depends on whether or not you think that
 

00:10:50.959 --> 00:10:53.410
depends on whether or not you think that
your time is worth while but the funny

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:53.420
your time is worth while but the funny
 

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.300
your time is worth while but the funny
thing about not assuming that is if you

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:55.310
thing about not assuming that is if you
 

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:57.639
thing about not assuming that is if you
assume your time isn't worthwhile what

00:10:57.639 --> 00:10:57.649
assume your time isn't worthwhile what
 

00:10:57.649 --> 00:10:58.870
assume your time isn't worthwhile what
happens is you don't just sit around

00:10:58.870 --> 00:10:58.880
happens is you don't just sit around
 

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.079
happens is you don't just sit around
sort of randomly in a state of

00:11:01.079 --> 00:11:01.089
sort of randomly in a state of
 

00:11:01.089 --> 00:11:03.760
sort of randomly in a state of
responsibility let's bliss what you do

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:03.770
responsibility let's bliss what you do
 

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:06.639
responsibility let's bliss what you do
is you suffer existentially and so that

00:11:06.639 --> 00:11:06.649
is you suffer existentially and so that
 

00:11:06.649 --> 00:11:10.630
is you suffer existentially and so that
seems like a stupid solution
