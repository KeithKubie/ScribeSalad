00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.430
Let me tell you my perspective. From personal experience,

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.700
data scientists today are people who have a blend

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.450
of many different skills. This Venn diagram shows a

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.720
definition of a data scientist that I like a lot.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.740
A data scientist is someone who knows mathematics and

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.510
statistics, which allows them to identify interesting insights in

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.550
a sea of data. They also have the programming

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.420
skills to code up statistical models and get data from

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.750
a variety of different data sources. Furthermore, a data

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.860
scientist is someone who knows how to ask the right

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.670
questions and translate those questions into a sound analysis.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.740
After doing the analysis, they have the communication skills to

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.010
report their findings in a way that people can

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.990
easily understand. In other words, data scientists have the ability

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.290
to perform complicated analysis on huge data sets. Once they've

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.940
done this, they also have the ability to write and

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.790
make informative graphs to communicate their findings to others.
