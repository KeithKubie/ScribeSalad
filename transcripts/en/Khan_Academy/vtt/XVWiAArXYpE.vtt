00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.261
- [Voiceover] Alright,
Kim, we have 216 years

00:00:02.261 --> 00:00:04.170
of Democratic Party history to cover,

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.719
let's cut the pleasantries
and get right to it.

00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:07.897
Who is this man?

00:00:07.897 --> 00:00:09.981
- [Voiceover] That is Thomas Jefferson.

00:00:09.981 --> 00:00:10.818
- [Voiceover] He does not look like

00:00:10.818 --> 00:00:14.802
the baby-faced boy that
he was in this image.

00:00:14.802 --> 00:00:16.230
Is this his presidential portrait?

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.186
- [Voiceover] (laughing)
I believe so, yes.

00:00:18.186 --> 00:00:20.074
So, Thomas Jefferson I think is really

00:00:20.074 --> 00:00:22.994
interesting because he didn't
set out to found a party,

00:00:22.994 --> 00:00:23.827
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:00:23.827 --> 00:00:25.745
- [Voiceover] Although,
he ended up doing so.

00:00:25.745 --> 00:00:28.932
It was more that he had
a competing vision about

00:00:28.932 --> 00:00:31.362
what the United States
should be that was different

00:00:31.362 --> 00:00:34.264
from the vision that was being
promoted by some of the men

00:00:34.264 --> 00:00:36.834
who were in power early
in the nation's history,

00:00:36.834 --> 00:00:40.485
like Washington, Adams,
Alexander Hamilton.

00:00:40.485 --> 00:00:42.157
- [Voiceover] What is the
difference between Jefferson

00:00:42.157 --> 00:00:44.953
and Hamilton's views on governance

00:00:44.953 --> 00:00:48.149
and how did this become
the Democratic Party?

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.788
- [Voiceover] Hamilton had
an idea that he was going

00:00:50.788 --> 00:00:54.154
to try to make the government
a little bit more centrist,

00:00:54.154 --> 00:00:55.906
so a strong central government,

00:00:55.906 --> 00:00:58.752
remember they've just
switched to the constitution

00:00:58.752 --> 00:01:00.598
from the Articles of Confederation.

00:01:00.598 --> 00:01:01.431
- [Voiceover] What year was that?

00:01:01.431 --> 00:01:02.264
- [Voiceover] 1787.

00:01:02.264 --> 00:01:03.099
- [Voiceover] Thank you.

00:01:03.099 --> 00:01:06.612
- [Voiceover] And Hamilton
thinks that there needs

00:01:06.612 --> 00:01:10.226
to be a strong central
government, a national bank,

00:01:10.226 --> 00:01:12.963
a kind of limited democracy, right?

00:01:12.963 --> 00:01:17.130
A democracy that is limited
to more educated, landed men,

00:01:18.208 --> 00:01:21.594
and he wants the United States
to be a lot like England.

00:01:21.594 --> 00:01:22.427
- [Voiceover] And Jefferson,

00:01:22.427 --> 00:01:24.132
and people who felt like Jefferson,

00:01:24.132 --> 00:01:26.714
like James Madison, were
saying, woah, woah, woah,

00:01:26.714 --> 00:01:29.372
this is not what we rebelled
against England for,

00:01:29.372 --> 00:01:31.316
to become England part two.

00:01:31.316 --> 00:01:32.149
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:33.152
- [Voiceover] Instead what we should have

00:01:33.152 --> 00:01:37.411
is very expanded democracy,
democracy for lots of people,

00:01:37.411 --> 00:01:41.875
doesn't matter their birth,
and much more agrarian,

00:01:41.875 --> 00:01:44.542
state-focused, small government.

00:01:46.026 --> 00:01:46.926
- [Voiceover] And this
is what we still call

00:01:46.926 --> 00:01:48.778
the Jeffersonian Ideal.

00:01:48.778 --> 00:01:49.611
- [Voiceover] Exactly, yeah.

00:01:49.611 --> 00:01:53.778
Small "r" republic citizens
who are mainly farmers.

00:01:57.749 --> 00:02:00.115
Now, of course, the expanded democracy

00:02:00.115 --> 00:02:01.785
that Jefferson's thinking about

00:02:01.785 --> 00:02:04.848
doesn't apply to women
or African Americans,

00:02:04.848 --> 00:02:07.705
Jefferson himself was a slaveholder.

00:02:07.705 --> 00:02:11.673
But he didn't want to limit
governance to only the elite.

00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:14.310
- [Voiceover] So, the
Jeffersonian Ideal is a republic

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.727
for all landholding citizens.

00:02:17.644 --> 00:02:18.477
- [Voiceover] Exactly.

00:02:18.477 --> 00:02:21.500
- [Voiceover] But in 1800 the
idea of what citizen meant

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.836
was very limited and langered.

00:02:23.836 --> 00:02:25.597
- [Voiceover] So this
doesn't really take root

00:02:25.597 --> 00:02:28.764
until the emergence of Andrew Jackson.

00:02:29.761 --> 00:02:33.928
In the late 1820's, he
finally gets elected in 1832.

00:02:34.892 --> 00:02:38.479
So Jackson really pushes
the idea of democracy

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:41.844
for all white men to
its farthest conclusion,

00:02:41.844 --> 00:02:44.532
which means that in this
time period he expanded

00:02:44.532 --> 00:02:48.844
the franchise to any white man
regardless of his property,

00:02:48.844 --> 00:02:52.748
which means that this
was the most democracy

00:02:52.748 --> 00:02:55.050
in the history of the
world up until this point.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.035
- [Voiceover] Yeah, but let me point out

00:02:56.035 --> 00:02:58.835
that you did say all white men.

00:02:58.835 --> 00:02:59.668
- [Voiceover] Exactly.

00:02:59.668 --> 00:03:02.668
So, Jackson is unabashedly a racist.

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:08.353
And his vision of manifest
destiny really involves

00:03:08.353 --> 00:03:10.987
the eradication of all Native Americans.

00:03:10.987 --> 00:03:12.724
- [Voiceover] I mean,
this is a really dark time

00:03:12.724 --> 00:03:15.592
for American Indian policy.

00:03:15.592 --> 00:03:19.624
This is when we see something
called the Indian Removal Act,

00:03:19.624 --> 00:03:22.360
that is literally what it's called.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.412
Jackson's presidency is also marked

00:03:24.412 --> 00:03:28.579
by the Cherokee Diaspora, the
forced removal of the Cherokee

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.640
along what's called the Trail of Tears.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.473
- [Voiceover] Yep.

00:03:32.473 --> 00:03:33.306
- [Voiceover] So, okay.

00:03:33.306 --> 00:03:35.678
So, before Jackson, do we really have

00:03:35.678 --> 00:03:38.239
the Democratic Party as an institution?

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.072
- [Voiceover] No.

00:03:39.072 --> 00:03:42.441
Before this we would've called
this the Anti-Federalists

00:03:42.441 --> 00:03:43.990
or the Democratic Republicans.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.760
- [Voiceover] Okay, so Hamilton
is a Federalist position.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.035
Jefferson is an Anti-Federalist

00:03:48.035 --> 00:03:49.051
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:03:49.051 --> 00:03:49.884
- [Voiceover] So, okay.

00:03:49.884 --> 00:03:53.191
So we have these kicking
around but they're not parties

00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:55.163
in the same way that
we would see them now,

00:03:55.163 --> 00:03:57.107
they're just sort of policy positions?

00:03:57.107 --> 00:03:58.126
- [Voiceover] Yeah, I would say so.

00:03:58.126 --> 00:04:00.642
Having a mass political party

00:04:00.642 --> 00:04:03.408
was really an invention
of the Jackson era.

00:04:03.408 --> 00:04:07.575
So, one did not run for
president in the early 1800's,

00:04:09.346 --> 00:04:12.163
one stood for president as gentlemen

00:04:12.163 --> 00:04:14.398
around you talked of your virtues.

00:04:14.398 --> 00:04:16.115
It wasn't a campaign.

00:04:16.115 --> 00:04:16.948
- [Voiceover] Oh, so you couldn't

00:04:16.948 --> 00:04:18.416
actually campaign for yourself?

00:04:18.416 --> 00:04:20.432
- [Voiceover] Right,
that was very uncouth.

00:04:20.432 --> 00:04:21.265
- [Voiceover] I see.

00:04:21.265 --> 00:04:24.263
- [Voiceover] So Jackson is
the real antidote to this.

00:04:24.263 --> 00:04:26.832
He creates massive democracy.

00:04:26.832 --> 00:04:30.199
The turnout in this time period
is 80, 90 percent, right?

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:31.892
So everybody goes to vote.

00:04:31.892 --> 00:04:32.725
- [Voiceover] So, okay.

00:04:32.725 --> 00:04:34.624
So, let's talk about
this political cartoon.

00:04:34.624 --> 00:04:36.809
- [Voiceover] Well, it's
really just making fun

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:40.357
of Andrew Jackson for
being incredibly stubborn.

00:04:40.357 --> 00:04:43.293
He vetoed everything because the position

00:04:43.293 --> 00:04:46.499
of the Democratic Party,
which is founded with Jackson,

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:47.863
he vetoes everything because

00:04:47.863 --> 00:04:49.895
he believes in small government.

00:04:49.895 --> 00:04:51.296
So, he thinks that the power

00:04:51.296 --> 00:04:53.815
of the government should
be negative, right?

00:04:53.815 --> 00:04:55.958
The less federal power, the better.

00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.378
Which is interesting
for a president, right?

00:04:58.378 --> 00:04:59.211
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:04:59.211 --> 00:05:01.145
- [Voiceover] So it's in this time period,

00:05:01.145 --> 00:05:04.938
from probably this cartoon,
that we get the image

00:05:04.938 --> 00:05:08.538
of the donkey as the iconic
of the Democratic Party.

00:05:08.538 --> 00:05:09.371
- [Voiceover] Cool.

00:05:09.371 --> 00:05:12.868
- [Voiceover] Because Jack-son
many believed was a Jack-ass.

00:05:12.868 --> 00:05:14.825
- [Voiceover] Ah.

00:05:14.825 --> 00:05:16.709
- [Voiceover] So the Democratic Party,

00:05:16.709 --> 00:05:18.488
as a party of all white men,

00:05:18.488 --> 00:05:23.089
ends up having a difficult
relationship with slavery.

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:27.296
Which is the major issue
of 19th century America.

00:05:27.296 --> 00:05:29.132
And the issue of slavery

00:05:29.132 --> 00:05:32.900
really ends up kinda breaking
the Democratic Party apart

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.650
because in the election of
1860, they actually split

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.852
into the Northern Democrats
and the Southern Democrats

00:05:40.852 --> 00:05:43.430
and run two different
candidates for president.

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.152
- [Voiceover] Woah, why?

00:05:45.152 --> 00:05:47.521
I knew that the Whigs
were split on slavery,

00:05:47.521 --> 00:05:49.004
what split the Democrats on slavery?

00:05:49.004 --> 00:05:51.702
- [Voiceover] Slavery, again.

00:05:51.702 --> 00:05:54.476
The Southern Democrats really supported

00:05:54.476 --> 00:05:56.380
the expansion of slavery everywhere.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.395
The Northern Democrats were just trying

00:05:58.395 --> 00:06:01.562
to prevent the Union from breaking up.

00:06:01.562 --> 00:06:04.047
- [Voiceover] So they were still
pro-slavery, but pro-Union?

00:06:04.047 --> 00:06:04.880
- [Voiceover] Yes.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.596
- [Voiceover] And that's why
they only carried Missouri?

00:06:06.596 --> 00:06:08.205
When it says Douglas here,
is that Stephen Douglas?

00:06:08.205 --> 00:06:09.257
- [Voiceover] That is Stephen Douglas,

00:06:09.257 --> 00:06:11.613
famous foe of Abraham Lincoln.

00:06:11.613 --> 00:06:12.446
- [Voiceover] Dang.

00:06:12.446 --> 00:06:14.260
- [Voiceover] And Stephen
Douglas actually died

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.994
I think in 1861.

00:06:15.994 --> 00:06:16.827
- [Voiceover] Woah!

00:06:16.827 --> 00:06:18.492
- [Voiceover] Which was a real shock

00:06:18.492 --> 00:06:20.297
for the Democratic Party because they

00:06:20.297 --> 00:06:23.381
lost their real, major
leader in the North.

00:06:23.381 --> 00:06:26.884
And so they are the minority
party as Abraham Lincoln

00:06:26.884 --> 00:06:30.769
and the first Republican
leads the United States

00:06:30.769 --> 00:06:32.770
to victory in the Civil War.

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.154
And so having been kind
of the opposition party

00:06:35.154 --> 00:06:38.272
against the victorious
party in war means that

00:06:38.272 --> 00:06:42.475
the Democrats are in a fairly
bad political position,

00:06:42.475 --> 00:06:45.308
really for most of the rest
of the 19th century, right?

00:06:45.308 --> 00:06:49.194
'Cause this is the real
ascension era of the Republicans

00:06:49.194 --> 00:06:51.712
as they wave the bloody shirt.

00:06:51.712 --> 00:06:55.031
- [Voiceover] So the Republican party bled

00:06:55.031 --> 00:06:56.261
to save the Union.

00:06:56.261 --> 00:06:57.094
- [Voiceover] Exactly.

00:06:57.094 --> 00:06:58.030
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:58.981
- [Voiceover] So that's your bloody shirt.

00:06:58.981 --> 00:07:00.037
- [Voiceover] That's my bloody shirt.

00:07:00.037 --> 00:07:00.870
- [Voiceover] It's amazing.

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:01.993
- [Voiceover] There it is.

00:07:01.993 --> 00:07:03.060
Little motion blur for you.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:03.961
(laughing)

00:07:03.961 --> 00:07:05.142
- [Voiceover] Of waving it, okay.

00:07:05.142 --> 00:07:05.975
I gotcha.

00:07:05.975 --> 00:07:06.836
- [Voiceover] So, okay.

00:07:06.836 --> 00:07:09.101
So this rhetorical strategy of saying,

00:07:09.101 --> 00:07:11.257
hey remember, the
Republicans were the ones

00:07:11.257 --> 00:07:12.691
that saved the Union,

00:07:12.691 --> 00:07:16.732
that basically makes the
Democrats a rump party, right?

00:07:16.732 --> 00:07:17.565
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

00:07:17.565 --> 00:07:18.398
For the rest of the 19th century.

00:07:18.398 --> 00:07:19.410
- [Voiceover] They're in bad shape.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:22.034
But they do have a few moments,

00:07:22.034 --> 00:07:25.060
especially in the late 19th century,

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.060
there's a major economic depression.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.827
And remember, economic
depression is never good

00:07:28.827 --> 00:07:30.480
for the party that's in power, right?

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.313
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:07:31.313 --> 00:07:32.146
Is that here?

00:07:32.146 --> 00:07:34.260
- [Voiceover] So, in the panic of 1893,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.747
there's just major economic trouble.

00:07:37.747 --> 00:07:39.129
And in this time period,

00:07:39.129 --> 00:07:43.279
this is an important moment
for the Democratic Party.

00:07:43.279 --> 00:07:44.714
- [Voiceover] Alright,
so Kim, who's this fella?

00:07:44.714 --> 00:07:46.549
- [Voiceover] So this is
William Jennings Bryan.

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:47.382
- [Voiceover] Oh, I know him.

00:07:47.382 --> 00:07:49.714
- [Voiceover] And he's one of those guys

00:07:49.714 --> 00:07:53.704
who ran for president so many
times but never actually won.

00:07:53.704 --> 00:07:54.537
So we don't--

00:07:54.537 --> 00:07:55.370
- [Voiceover] Cross of Gold speech guy.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:56.203
- [Voiceover] Exactly, right.

00:07:56.203 --> 00:07:58.002
So he had this idea that the United States

00:07:58.002 --> 00:08:00.128
should move off the gold standard

00:08:00.128 --> 00:08:02.246
and instead allow silver as one of

00:08:02.246 --> 00:08:04.710
the currencies backing the U.S. dollar.

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:07.444
And the idea behind this was that then

00:08:07.444 --> 00:08:09.596
the money would flood into the economy,

00:08:09.596 --> 00:08:11.149
and people would get wealthier,

00:08:11.149 --> 00:08:12.947
and it would end this depression.

00:08:12.947 --> 00:08:14.149
And that's not how it happened,

00:08:14.149 --> 00:08:16.914
but what it does do is
moves the Democratic Party

00:08:16.914 --> 00:08:19.816
in a more populist direction, taking care

00:08:19.816 --> 00:08:23.983
of the smaller people who
need more help financially.

00:08:25.143 --> 00:08:29.612
Right, so a more
interventionist, economic policy.

00:08:29.612 --> 00:08:31.645
And so they want to kinda start

00:08:31.645 --> 00:08:33.348
helping the little guy with money.

00:08:33.348 --> 00:08:34.448
And you see this kind of in

00:08:34.448 --> 00:08:36.712
what we would call the Progressive Era.

00:08:36.712 --> 00:08:40.947
Which Wilson, who's gonna be
the next Democratic president,

00:08:40.947 --> 00:08:45.785
starting in 1912, he's a big
champion of Progressivism.

00:08:45.785 --> 00:08:49.952
And it's under Wilson's rule
that the 19th Amendment,

00:08:50.934 --> 00:08:53.358
granting women the right
to vote, is passed.

00:08:53.358 --> 00:08:57.670
So this is kind of
anti-corruption, anti-monopoly,

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:01.020
very pro trying to protect the consumer.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:04.458
So this is where the sort
of more liberal aspect

00:09:04.458 --> 00:09:07.776
of Democratic monetary policy comes from.

00:09:07.776 --> 00:09:10.060
I don't wanna give the
impression that Progressivism

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:13.794
and Wilson were 100 percent good things.

00:09:13.794 --> 00:09:17.247
On one hand, Wilson was the
first Southern president,

00:09:17.247 --> 00:09:18.665
he was a Virginian.

00:09:18.665 --> 00:09:20.648
Since the Civil War, after this era

00:09:20.648 --> 00:09:22.797
of waving the bloody shirt,
and one of the things

00:09:22.797 --> 00:09:26.222
that Wilson does is he
segregates federal jobs.

00:09:26.222 --> 00:09:28.286
So many African Americans who were working

00:09:28.286 --> 00:09:31.450
in the federal government
were forced out under Wilson.

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:32.417
- [Voiceover] And don't forget that Wilson

00:09:32.417 --> 00:09:36.702
is the president who
screened the pro-KKK film,

00:09:36.702 --> 00:09:40.055
"Birth of a Nation" at
the White House in 1915.

00:09:40.055 --> 00:09:41.329
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

00:09:41.329 --> 00:09:43.260
- [Voiceover] Alright, and
then World War I happened,

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.196
and then the stock market crash happened.

00:09:45.196 --> 00:09:47.050
- [Voiceover] Yeah, and the
stock market crash happened

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:49.563
under Republican rule, and
it's never a good thing

00:09:49.563 --> 00:09:50.664
when your party's in power,

00:09:50.664 --> 00:09:52.848
and there's a major economic downturn.

00:09:52.848 --> 00:09:53.681
- [Voiceover] Right, and that's during

00:09:53.681 --> 00:09:54.963
the Hoover Administration.

00:09:54.963 --> 00:09:56.484
- [Voiceover] Exactly, before then.

00:09:56.484 --> 00:09:59.502
And so it's after this economic crash

00:09:59.502 --> 00:10:02.783
that Franklin Delano
Roosevelt comes into power.

00:10:02.783 --> 00:10:04.483
And now Roosevelt has this very

00:10:04.483 --> 00:10:07.433
liberal approach to economics, right?

00:10:07.433 --> 00:10:09.987
And this is where sort of contemporary,

00:10:09.987 --> 00:10:12.785
modern American liberalism comes from,

00:10:12.785 --> 00:10:14.840
which is an idea that government

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.558
should regulate the economy.

00:10:17.558 --> 00:10:19.454
You know, they shouldn't
control the economy,

00:10:19.454 --> 00:10:21.296
but they should try to mediate some

00:10:21.296 --> 00:10:24.442
of these major swings that
the economy could make.

00:10:24.442 --> 00:10:26.709
And also that government
has a responsibility

00:10:26.709 --> 00:10:29.360
for the welfare of its people.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.645
So, FDR implements the New Deal.

00:10:32.645 --> 00:10:36.728
Which is a really sweeping
set of social programs

00:10:38.058 --> 00:10:40.712
designed to try to get people
out of their depression,

00:10:40.712 --> 00:10:42.547
and guarantee a certain standard

00:10:42.547 --> 00:10:44.363
of living for all Americans.

00:10:44.363 --> 00:10:45.445
- [Voiceover] What are
some of those programs

00:10:45.445 --> 00:10:47.563
from the New Deal that
we still have today?

00:10:47.563 --> 00:10:49.352
- [Voiceover] Social Security I think

00:10:49.352 --> 00:10:51.497
would be one of the biggest ones.

00:10:51.497 --> 00:10:55.686
That's a living wage for the
elderly, or the disabled.

00:10:55.686 --> 00:11:00.537
And the FDIC, the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation,

00:11:00.537 --> 00:11:03.237
which backs banks, for example.

00:11:03.237 --> 00:11:04.755
But what's interesting about this,

00:11:04.755 --> 00:11:06.953
is that we often think
of the Democratic Party

00:11:06.953 --> 00:11:08.106
and the Republican Party kind of

00:11:08.106 --> 00:11:10.106
having opposite stances on things.

00:11:10.106 --> 00:11:11.906
But the Democratic Party
in this time period

00:11:11.906 --> 00:11:15.124
kinda had a liberal Northern wing,

00:11:15.124 --> 00:11:17.075
and then a Southern conservative wing,

00:11:17.075 --> 00:11:20.051
so there are two kind of
parts of the Democratic Party.

00:11:20.051 --> 00:11:21.434
- [Voiceover] Sure, so
let's look at this map here,

00:11:21.434 --> 00:11:23.303
what is this Solid South thing?

00:11:23.303 --> 00:11:24.519
- [Voiceover] So this is the Solid South,

00:11:24.519 --> 00:11:28.686
and the Solid South is the
Democratic, pro-Jim Crow South.

00:11:30.955 --> 00:11:33.289
So there's the Democratic
Party in the South,

00:11:33.289 --> 00:11:36.593
which is much smaller government,

00:11:36.593 --> 00:11:39.309
really wanted to make sure
that African Americans

00:11:39.309 --> 00:11:42.809
were prevented from having
political power in the South.

00:11:42.809 --> 00:11:46.746
So it's interesting because
African Americans after FDR

00:11:46.746 --> 00:11:49.011
really join the Democratic party,

00:11:49.011 --> 00:11:51.340
but in the South, most of them can't vote.

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:52.602
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:11:52.602 --> 00:11:54.431
It's a very uncomfortable alliance.

00:11:54.431 --> 00:11:55.863
So, Kim, sorry, I thought that

00:11:55.863 --> 00:11:57.212
this part of the country, the Northeast,

00:11:57.212 --> 00:12:01.126
was still pretty solidly
Republican at this time.

00:12:01.126 --> 00:12:02.915
- [Voiceover] I would say
that FDR puts together

00:12:02.915 --> 00:12:06.665
kind of a New Deal
Coalition of labor unions,

00:12:08.849 --> 00:12:11.198
ethnic and religious minorities,

00:12:11.198 --> 00:12:14.044
sort of the workers of the United States,

00:12:14.044 --> 00:12:18.233
who want a more interventionist
government economy.

00:12:18.233 --> 00:12:19.419
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:12:19.419 --> 00:12:21.653
- [Voiceover] But don't necessarily want

00:12:21.653 --> 00:12:25.154
the moralizing aspect
that goes along with say,

00:12:25.154 --> 00:12:27.404
the Progressive Era, right?

00:12:28.267 --> 00:12:31.319
The Progressives passed
prohibition, for example, right?

00:12:31.319 --> 00:12:33.969
They thought it was morally bad to drink.

00:12:33.969 --> 00:12:36.152
And one of the first things
FDR does when he gets

00:12:36.152 --> 00:12:39.188
into office is to repeal
prohibition saying,

00:12:39.188 --> 00:12:41.454
you know, what America
needs now is a drink.

00:12:41.454 --> 00:12:42.287
Right?

00:12:42.287 --> 00:12:43.502
So it doesn't have this moral aspect,

00:12:43.502 --> 00:12:45.603
but it does have economic control.

00:12:45.603 --> 00:12:46.436
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:12:46.436 --> 00:12:48.005
- [Voiceover] But the party
continues to kinda move

00:12:48.005 --> 00:12:52.589
to the left on social issues,
and in the mid 1960's,

00:12:52.589 --> 00:12:57.324
Lyndon Johnson start to pass
civil rights legislation,

00:12:57.324 --> 00:13:00.360
like the Civil Rights Act of 1964,

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.210
and also pretty sweeping social programs,

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:04.700
which are called the Great Society.

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:07.390
So these is things like Head Start

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:09.807
and lots of welfare programs.

00:13:12.124 --> 00:13:13.175
And in this time period,

00:13:13.175 --> 00:13:15.061
along with the Civil
Rights Movement, you know,

00:13:15.061 --> 00:13:19.228
the Democratic Party really
coalesces around this group

00:13:20.428 --> 00:13:24.013
in the North who are
more pro-civil rights.

00:13:24.013 --> 00:13:26.846
So this period from FDR's election

00:13:28.301 --> 00:13:31.349
through Lyndon Johnson's administration

00:13:31.349 --> 00:13:33.792
is really kind of the Democratic heyday

00:13:33.792 --> 00:13:35.446
in the United States.

00:13:35.446 --> 00:13:39.530
Save for Eisenhower, there is
no other Republican president

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:41.328
that's elected during this time period,

00:13:41.328 --> 00:13:45.495
so this is 30 plus years
of Democratic ascendancy.

00:13:46.433 --> 00:13:49.183
But it kinda comes apart in 1968.

00:13:50.848 --> 00:13:52.386
- [Voiceover] So what happens in 1968?

00:13:52.386 --> 00:13:54.767
- [Voiceover] Well, there's
a lot of social unrest.

00:13:54.767 --> 00:13:57.338
The assassination of
Martin Luther King Jr.,

00:13:57.338 --> 00:14:01.284
the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy,

00:14:01.284 --> 00:14:02.784
many summer riots.

00:14:03.681 --> 00:14:06.885
And many whites in the
South who had, you know,

00:14:06.885 --> 00:14:10.048
followed this Democratic Coalition here,

00:14:10.048 --> 00:14:12.399
began to feel that the
Civil Rights Movement

00:14:12.399 --> 00:14:14.949
and the commitment of the Democratic Party

00:14:14.949 --> 00:14:18.446
to civil rights had
gone too far, basically.

00:14:18.446 --> 00:14:22.045
And there was the problem of Vietnam.

00:14:22.045 --> 00:14:24.165
The Vietnam War, which both parties

00:14:24.165 --> 00:14:27.181
were really strongly
anti-Communist in this time period,

00:14:27.181 --> 00:14:29.821
so many of the sort of young people,

00:14:29.821 --> 00:14:34.202
who might otherwise have
supported the Democratic Party,

00:14:34.202 --> 00:14:36.271
began to feel that the
Democratic Party too

00:14:36.271 --> 00:14:38.822
was part of this war machine that was just

00:14:38.822 --> 00:14:41.843
sending the United States
citizens to fight a war

00:14:41.843 --> 00:14:44.273
that they believed they
had nothing to do with.

00:14:44.273 --> 00:14:46.874
- [Voiceover] So we're seeing
this demographic shift.

00:14:46.874 --> 00:14:47.787
- [Voiceover] Exactly.

00:14:47.787 --> 00:14:51.576
So this Solid South, which
had been voting Democratic

00:14:51.576 --> 00:14:55.917
because they had really
complete political hegemony,

00:14:55.917 --> 00:14:58.907
right, 'cause African
Americans couldn't vote,

00:14:58.907 --> 00:15:01.139
now that African Americans can vote,

00:15:01.139 --> 00:15:02.810
many of those whites end up switching

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:04.412
to the Republican Party.

00:15:04.412 --> 00:15:05.281
- [Voiceover] Interesting.

00:15:05.281 --> 00:15:07.358
Alright, so Johnson decides
he's not even gonna run again.

00:15:07.358 --> 00:15:08.191
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:15:08.191 --> 00:15:10.793
'Cause he knows he can't
win because the Vietnam War

00:15:10.793 --> 00:15:13.808
has just tarnished him in
the sight of most Americans.

00:15:13.808 --> 00:15:14.641
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:15:14.641 --> 00:15:16.613
- [Voiceover] So, with the
Democrats really split apart,

00:15:16.613 --> 00:15:18.395
in complete disarray, the Republicans

00:15:18.395 --> 00:15:20.296
take back the White House.

00:15:20.296 --> 00:15:21.129
- [Voiceover] So, okay.

00:15:21.129 --> 00:15:23.485
So Kim, that takes us up to about 1968

00:15:23.485 --> 00:15:25.814
and the election of Nixon.

00:15:25.814 --> 00:15:29.100
And there's a lot of history
of the Democratic Party.

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.635
216 years, right?

00:15:30.635 --> 00:15:32.398
- [Voiceover] Yep, it is the oldest,

00:15:32.398 --> 00:15:35.384
voter-based political party in the world.

00:15:35.384 --> 00:15:36.217
- [Voiceover] So, we can't fit

00:15:36.217 --> 00:15:37.725
the entire history into one video.

00:15:37.725 --> 00:15:38.959
- [Voiceover] No, there's too much.

00:15:38.959 --> 00:15:40.344
- [Voiceover] So, next
time when we come back,

00:15:40.344 --> 00:15:41.430
we're gonna talk about

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:43.566
the new Democrats under President Clinton,

00:15:43.566 --> 00:15:45.547
we're gonna talk about
the Obama Administration,

00:15:45.547 --> 00:15:47.280
and the policy and the plank

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.580
of the Democratic Party going forward.

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:51.913
- [Voiceover] So stay tuned.
