As we discussed briefly in lesson two,
physicians are in the data business.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.260
They collect data, analyze that data,
make decisions based on it,

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.970
and follow up using still more data, so
they can make adjustments as needed.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.350
Despite this, medical records and

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.770
record keeping often receive minimal
attention in medical training.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.980
And most medical schools offer no
training in health informatics

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.590
beyond learning to use
whatever electronic

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.960
record systems are deployed in
their hospitals and clinics.
