00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:03.230
Look.

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:04.230
You clicked on this video.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.740
You knew what was coming.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:15.380
Let's get this over with.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.199
Naked Gardening Day is in May, and World Naked
Bike Riding are coming in June, and nude and

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:25.339
underwear runs happen all over the world,
but all this naked celebration got me pondering

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:28.670
the intersection of nudity, health and science.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.690
Being naked helps us form a realistic body
positive connection to the human form.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.070
People who spend time naked have a better
body image, don't objectify as quickly, and

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.969
are more confident and cozy in our skin!

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.289
But outside of bonus of a realistic self-image;
there ARE concrete, scientifically proven

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:49.059
benefits to being naked!

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.739
Firstly, being naked exposes more of your
skin to the sunlight, which means more Vitamin

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.750
D exposure -- which is great -- and it helps
your bones absorb calcium, so being naked

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.510
will help you get strong bones.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.579
But you also have to look out for UV radiation,
so remember sunscreen.

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.320
A study from the University of Reading claims
if naked, we would have fewer parasites living

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.020
on our bodies overall.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.410
Humans are petri dishes as it is, we're constantly
covered in bacteria -- some good some bad.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:21.590
Clothing, like fur, promotes increased bacterial
load by giving it a comfy dark place to gather

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:22.590
and spread.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.510
Since the invention of clothing, scientists
can point to specific evolution of lice and

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:33.290
other human skin parasites,; though, unlike
fur we can swap our outfit when it gets too

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:34.290
germy.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.970
But, by comparison, research looked at the
bacterial load on naked molerats and other

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.440
hairless non-aquatic species and found lower-than
expected levels!

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.220
So being naked, would likely decrease bacterial
load on the skin for humans too!

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.940
Sleeping nude has been shown to have myriad
of scientific benefits.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.430
When the human body settles into the sleep
cycle, our temperature drops; which is why

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.270
it's better to sleep in a room that's less
than 70 degrees [21C].

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.270
Research in the journal Sleep found sleeping
with clothes on prevents this natural cooling

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.270
cycle.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.690
That cooling triggers the release of human
growth hormone from the brain, restoring skin

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.840
and regenerating the body -- that regeneration
requires energy, which your body gets from

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.500
fat -- which burns when we cool off during
sleep.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.200
Get naked, and you'll sleep BETTER because
the body won't be fighting to control your

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.200
temperature.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.260
Plus, you decrease stress hormones like cortisol
because you'll sleep better overall.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.579
Sleeping naked with a partner has some obvious
bonuses… wink wink; but less-than-obvious

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.109
is simple skin-to-skin contact during sleep.

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:35.660
When skin touches during sleep -- even in
a non-sexual way -- the hormone oxytocin is

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.950
released lowering blood pressure, decreasing
inflammation and lowering stress hormones.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.730
A study in Japan found sleeping with a bra
or girdle constricts the anatomy and can raise

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.299
body temperature and decrease melatonin.

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.400
So, sleep naked at least, but that's easy!

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.780
The rest of the day is a challenge, but there
are benefits there too.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.129
For instance, though this doesn’t exactly
make the case for total nudity, research shows

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.360
that neckties can be harmful to your health.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.879
A study in the British Journal of Ophthalmology
asked men to wear and tighten a necktie, while

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:13.120
doctors monitored their intraocular pressure
-- a moderately tight tie caused physical

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.819
changes to the eyeball which upped a risk
factor for the development of glaucoma!

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.530
So do ditch the tie.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.430
And while you're at it, ditch the tight pants
too.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.459
The science is iffy, but some doctors claim
tight pants for men can inhibit sperm development,

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.260
and tight clothing for women allow for bacteria
to cultivate in the vulva and within the vagina.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.010
Hair or fur exists to keep animals warm, AND
to protect them from the sun.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.349
We don't have the fur, likely because we have
one of the best sweat systems around!

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:44.700
Sweatier humans needed less body covering,
because it interfered with the evaporation

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:45.700
of that moisture.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.719
Clothing, like artificial fur, interferes
with sweating… so in case you didn't get

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:51.870
the moral of this little story…

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.650
GET NAKED MORE.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.409
Do you like being naked?

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:57.790
Or are you a never-nude?

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.319
When i get home, the first thing I do is take
my pants off.

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:01.319
Seriously.

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:02.879
Tell us how you feel in the comments.

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.920
And while we’re talking about skin, have
you ever wondered how your skin is being affected

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:07.920
by the sun?

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.739
