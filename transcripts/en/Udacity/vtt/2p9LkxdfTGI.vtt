00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.680
In the binary classification section,

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.580
we learned about decision trees which
were used to predict binary variables.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.430
They do this by splitting the data and

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.360
creating the largest difference at
the percent between the target group.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.712
Well guess what, they can also
be used to predict non-binary

00:00:15.712 --> 00:00:20.600
classification data and we'll be using
this for our new business problems.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.480
Since we already learned
the foundation of decision trees,

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.710
let's flip over to Alteryx
to build this model out.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.280
Now, what we are going to do is
build a decision tree over Alteryx,

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.250
interpret the results and
validate the model.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.160
If you recall,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.720
the goal of this analysis is to
predict what mode of transportation

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.130
the 40% of employees who did not
respond to this survey actually use.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.300
Since we have already built out
a decision tree, go ahead and

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.500
bring in the data and
build this model out yourself.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.320
We can then validate
the model afterwards.
