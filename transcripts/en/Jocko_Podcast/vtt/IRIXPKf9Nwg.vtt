00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.760
I'm a 17 year old,
I'm a blue belt in Jujitsu,

2
00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.320
which I received a few days after my 16th birthday and I have ambitions of

3
00:00:08.321 --> 00:00:12.190
pursuing Jujitsu professionally and competing to the highest level possible.

4
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.290
Of course,
this requires discipline and commitment.
So during the school term,

5
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.240
I trained you to two Monday through Saturday and I weight train on Friday and

6
00:00:22.241 --> 00:00:26.200
Sunday.
And when I have time off school,
I trained you two to three times a day.

7
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.010
However,

8
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.990
due to my commitment to this and my refusal to prioritize the other things over

9
00:00:31.991 --> 00:00:32.321
this,

10
00:00:32.321 --> 00:00:37.180
I feel I'm missing out on the social opportunities of this part of my life.

11
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.200
I Miss Parties and social events in order to stranger Jujitsu and weight train

12
00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.590
because I know that I should have the discipline to do so,

13
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.830
however I feel lonely and isolated because of it.

14
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.770
Is this just weakness or should I make the occasional exception for a social

15
00:00:53.771 --> 00:00:56.890
event?
Once again,
love the work you do,
you and echo do.

16
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.800
It's how it's helped me immensely.
Thanks from the UK.
All right.

17
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.650
<v 1>The UK.
Um,
first of all,
I'd just,
okay.</v>

18
00:01:03.651 --> 00:01:05.480
The hardcore hears that the couple of hardcore answers,

19
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.720
the hardcore nerds number,
what's your schedule like?
Right?

20
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.660
Are you wasting any time?
Have you,
have you maxed them?

21
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.180
Maximize the hours you can get out of a day?

22
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.540
Or are you spending time doing other things that you shouldn't be doing?

23
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.330
That being said,
it sounds like you're getting after it pretty hard,

24
00:01:23.331 --> 00:01:27.920
which means you're probably pretty efficient.
And if you're,
if you're

25
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.540
not wasting a bunch of time and you're not doing a bunch of things that are non

26
00:01:34.641 --> 00:01:39.440
productive and you're feeling lonely and isolated,

27
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.440
then guess what?
You're going too far.
You don't,

28
00:01:42.441 --> 00:01:47.210
you should not be feeling lonely and isolated.
That's not good.
You need to relax.

29
00:01:47.211 --> 00:01:50.720
Especially because if you're training that much,
you're likely overtraining.

30
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.540
So broadly speaking,
now,
broadly speaking,
training should be enjoyable.

31
00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.970
Okay?
This doesn't mean that you're gonna love it every day.

32
00:01:58.971 --> 00:01:59.990
And I talk about that all the time.

33
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.240
It doesn't mean every day you wake up and you're all,
you know,

34
00:02:02.241 --> 00:02:05.540
smile from one ear to the other year cause you're so happy you got to go do you

35
00:02:05.541 --> 00:02:08.270
know,
squats and dead lifts like no,
that doesn't happen.

36
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.270
But broadly the way it makes you feel,

37
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.130
the way Jujitsu makes you feel should make it,

38
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.200
are there times when you go on the you to Matt and you get spanked and you get

39
00:02:18.201 --> 00:02:23.201
ground out and you get tapped out and you feel like junk.

40
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.980
Yes,
that going to happen.
But again,
broadly,
how does you do to make you feel?

41
00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:31.880
It makes you feel good.
You should enjoy it to some extent,
right?

42
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.310
And you should not be getting burnt out.

43
00:02:34.311 --> 00:02:38.060
And I think that's the most important thing is that you shouldn't be getting

44
00:02:38.061 --> 00:02:42.950
burnt out on Jujitsu,
on working out.
And,

45
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.720
and this is,
this is important,
especially for your 17 years old.

46
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.090
There is more to life than Jujitsu and physical fitness,

47
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.110
right?
There's more to,
there's more to,

48
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.020
there's more to doing well in life than just Jujitsu and physical fitness.

49
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.830
So a couple things.
If you can't,

50
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.700
you can't like communicate with people effectively.

51
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.690
That's a real problem in any environment,
right?

52
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.990
And if you're isolating yourself from other people and you're not,

53
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.550
you're not learning how to interact with other human beings in a social

54
00:03:24.551 --> 00:03:28.210
environment,
that's not good.
And it's not only,
it's not only that,
it's,

55
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.620
it's not only that,
it's just not good for you because yes,
you as a person,

56
00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:35.410
you need to be well rounded.
You need to be,
yes,
you need to be strong,

57
00:03:35.411 --> 00:03:37.480
you need to be capable from a fighting perspective,

58
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.270
but you all still need to be smart.
You need to be articulate,

59
00:03:40.271 --> 00:03:41.320
you need to be quick.
Witted

60
00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.000
and those things are mandatory skills in life.
I mean,

61
00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.140
if you're a black belt in Jujitsu and you're a white belt and communicating with

62
00:03:51.141 --> 00:03:53.840
other human beings,
that's not going to be a good situation for you.

63
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.360
And the other thing is,
the better you are,

64
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.810
the more well rounded you are in all these other aspects of life of those things

65
00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:04.600
will actually make you better at Jujitsu.
Cause you'll be able to read people,

66
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.520
you'll be able to deal with confrontation.

67
00:04:06.521 --> 00:04:09.880
You'll be able to understand other people's motivations and all those things

68
00:04:09.881 --> 00:04:11.860
come from interacting with other human beings.

69
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.830
So I get it.

70
00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.630
I get the massive commitment and that is what it takes.

71
00:04:20.631 --> 00:04:24.260
Like if you want to compete at the highest level,
I'm telling you,
yes,

72
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.130
you have to live,
breathe and eat Jujitsu.
You have to live,

73
00:04:28.131 --> 00:04:32.950
breathe and eat conditioning.
And that being said,

74
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.020
if that's all you live,
breathe and eat,

75
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.540
that's going to make you less apt to be a champion.

76
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.710
Then if you make yourself a little bit more well rounded in some of these other

77
00:04:46.711 --> 00:04:51.210
aspects.
So dude,
keep training hard.

78
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.860
17 year old blue belt from UK.
Keep training hard,

79
00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.350
go out occasionally hang out with some people.
Yeah,
have a good time.

80
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.900
<v 0>And that by no means means get hammered every time you do it at all.</v>

81
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.460
Not at all.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
That social aspect,
man,
that's like this.

82
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.000
It seems like a lot of times,
especially when you're training,

83
00:05:16.001 --> 00:05:18.610
are you doing something that's kind of directly or can be viewed as like

84
00:05:18.611 --> 00:05:20.620
directly opposite of a social thing?
Because you know,

85
00:05:20.621 --> 00:05:23.680
when you think socially you're thing call,
you guys are just slacking,
you know,

86
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.270
going to the Bar,
cruising at the beach,
whatever.
Well,

87
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.880
while we're over here training kind of thing.
Right.
Just like,

88
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.760
just like people say,
Oh,
you're sleeping on the couch,
you know,

89
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.030
what are you lazy sleeping on the couch with.
I Dunno.
Maybe they need rest,

90
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.190
you know,
or make there's,
there's,

91
00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.900
there is use in sleep.
Seems like that was a,
that was a little,

92
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.130
maybe kind of a glimpse into the Echo Charles world right there.
Maybe.
Maybe not.

93
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.740
Nonetheless,
you sleep on the couch,
maybe I need rest.

94
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.080
Maybe I'm recovering from the workout.
I'm saying,

95
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.870
I'm saying there's two parts of it,
you know,
that there's that.

96
00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.490
And so in

97
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.820
<v 1>people give it a bad rap,
I think.
Especially like you,
you know how like,
you know,</v>

98
00:06:01.821 --> 00:06:03.140
you hear these,
you know,

99
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.520
motivational gurus grind all sleep when I'm dead,
you know,
that kind of thing.

100
00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.650
Right?
Yeah.
So I,
you said it,
not me,
but hey,

101
00:06:12.651 --> 00:06:16.050
all right.
So,
and I'm not saying that,
you know,

102
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.410
that's dumb or nothing like that.
I'm saying,

103
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.600
I'm saying that it produces a certain message that can be interpreted in a way

104
00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:28.250
that might not be the most beneficial.
Well,
I'm sure I think this,

105
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:28.940
this,

106
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.720
I'm glad that he asked this question because he's taken the attitude of like,

107
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.160
okay,
I'm going to sleep when I'm dead and I'm going to,

108
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.830
I'm going to hang out with other human beings after I'm a world champion.
Right?

109
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:43.280
And again,
do you need to be possessed to be world champion?
Yes,
you do.

110
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:48.670
But all I'm saying is part of the things that will make you be a better well

111
00:06:49.341 --> 00:06:53.390
rounded person,
the more well rounded you are,
the better you're going to perform.

112
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.910
You know,
you're going to learn how to deal with anxiety.

113
00:06:55.911 --> 00:06:57.200
You're going to learn how to deal with people.

114
00:06:57.201 --> 00:06:59.560
You're gonna learn how to look at someone else's situated,

115
00:06:59.561 --> 00:07:01.850
look in their eyes and be like,
okay,
this guy's stressed out,

116
00:07:01.851 --> 00:07:03.350
or this guy's panicking,
or this guy,
you know,

117
00:07:03.351 --> 00:07:05.390
you learn those things from interacting with other people.

118
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:07.010
That's going to make you a better competitor.

119
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:08.570
You're going to learn more about yourself.

120
00:07:08.571 --> 00:07:11.870
That's going to make you a better competitor.
Yeah,
and you're going to be,
if you,

121
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:12.920
if you relax now,

122
00:07:12.921 --> 00:07:15.300
what you don't want to do is go so far in the other direction where you,

123
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.990
where you show up to a competition,

124
00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:22.310
you don't feel like you've prepared as much as you could,
but that,

125
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:22.770
what does that,

126
00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.530
do you go too far in the other direction now you overtrained yeah,

127
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:27.800
so you've got to find a little bit of,

128
00:07:27.801 --> 00:07:29.180
but sounds like you're a little bit off balanced,

129
00:07:29.181 --> 00:07:32.120
especially cause you're feeling like the words that kind of keyed me off the

130
00:07:32.121 --> 00:07:37.060
most in this was what was it?
Lonely and isolated.
That's what kind of key,

131
00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.820
if you said everything else here and then you were like,
um,

132
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.680
am I over training?
I would have said,
Nah man,
you're getting after it.
Good job.

133
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.980
But then when you say,
look,
I feel lonely and isolated.

134
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:51.500
You don't want to feel lonely and isolated.
Like,

135
00:07:51.501 --> 00:07:54.590
and that's another thing when I trained Jujitsu,
that's kind of where I hang out.

136
00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:57.170
Like I don't interact with people normally it's a social thing.

137
00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:58.670
We might not even talk.

138
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:03.470
We might not even say one word other than do you want a roll?
And then we train.

139
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.190
That's sort of my social activity of,

140
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.440
of hanging around with other people and I don't feel I leave the gym and I feel

141
00:08:09.441 --> 00:08:11.840
like I hung out with a lot of people.
I didn't say anything to him.

142
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.810
But if you feel lonely and isolated,
that's not good.
That's getting to you.

143
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.930
That means your mind is starting to be worn down from this.

144
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:24.590
Don't let it get worn out.
It's going to refuel you to go out.

145
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:29.000
It's gonna Watch this,
watch this.
If you're feeling lonely and isolated,

146
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.150
your workout that day is like a nine.

147
00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:37.640
If you feel like like,
Hey,
I'm having a good life.
I'm,
I'm filled with energy.

148
00:08:37.641 --> 00:08:39.060
I like hanging out.
I just,
you know,

149
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.860
had a good time with this girl last night and now I'm going to train.
It's like,

150
00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:43.850
oh,
okay,
guess what?

151
00:08:43.851 --> 00:08:48.230
That out to 9.7 you get a better training cause you had a good time.
Yeah.

152
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:51.080
So,
yeah,
I don't like to,

153
00:08:51.081 --> 00:08:54.680
I don't like the fact that he says he's lonely and isolated desk,
not good.

154
00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:01.170
And of,
again,
this is just a dichotomy because then you'll get someone that says,

155
00:09:01.171 --> 00:09:03.570
okay,
well Jocko would go out and you don't have party,
you know,

156
00:09:03.571 --> 00:09:07.890
party party with the ladies and then the whole Mexico.
Yeah.

157
00:09:07.891 --> 00:09:09.870
It'll help my workout.
And then,
well,
you know,

158
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.580
maybe if I only work out three times a week and I spend most of my time
partying,

159
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:18.660
I'll be just,
I'll get workouts level 11.
No you won't.

160
00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:21.540
So yeah,
man,

161
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:26.970
make some exceptions to your discipline and go enjoy the company of some other

162
00:09:26.971 --> 00:09:30.600
people.
Grow a little bit as a person.
Become a better human,
compete better,

163
00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:31.493
train harder.

164
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.860
<v 0>That's it.
I agree,
man.
This is a concept that I think is,</v>

165
00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:40.760
if you can kind of incorporate or understand this concept in,
you know,

166
00:09:40.761 --> 00:09:43.790
when you're working hard at something.
So when I was young,

167
00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:47.480
when I first started lifting weights,
first started,
I don't know,

168
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:51.500
15 or however old.
Um,
so you know,

169
00:09:51.501 --> 00:09:55.040
you know how when you lift weights and you get that little pump right to me,

170
00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:58.970
to me,
I thought that that's literally my muscles growing.
You know,

171
00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:01.580
like I didn't know how it all worked.
I was like,
Dang,

172
00:10:01.581 --> 00:10:03.730
my mom said I can see the growth already.

173
00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:08.250
So all they gotta do is lift every single day and watch out quick.
You know,

174
00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:11.210
cause most people they won't work as hard as me cause I'll just,

175
00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:15.800
cause I liked doing it.
I like the pump,
whatever.
Um,
so I would do,

176
00:10:15.801 --> 00:10:18.230
we remember the guy,

177
00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:22.910
my friend I mentioned Eric Masters pilot in the air force.
Yes.

178
00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:27.050
So he,
he had the one,
he always said the soda above the microwave there.
Anyway,

179
00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:31.650
so I lived with him,
Him and his dad would invite me and my brother over,
we'll,

180
00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.280
we'll live with and he started off with bench and you know,
this stuff.

181
00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:39.410
So w we go lift and I'm like,
Dang,
I feel a pump.
So now when I,

182
00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:42.430
when we trend kind of went into,

183
00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.370
I want to say like forest city football,
I don't know.
Anyway,
we were,

184
00:10:45.371 --> 00:10:47.390
we started lifting in the weight room at the high school,

185
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.360
so I would do the same thing every single day,
every single day,
every single day.

186
00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.000
And my friend was like,
this other guy I know.
He goes,

187
00:10:53.001 --> 00:10:57.230
hey you are you benching every single day?
And I was like,
yeah.

188
00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.800
And he was like,
Bro,
your muscles aren't going to grow.
I was like,

189
00:11:00.801 --> 00:11:02.900
what are you talking about?
Of course they do.
They grow every single day.

190
00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:05.870
Like I feel it even he's like,
Bro,
you don't know how it works.
He's like,

191
00:11:05.871 --> 00:11:08.450
you don't,
when you lift they don't grow.

192
00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:12.830
They actually get torn and they get like almost like a little micro injury that

193
00:11:12.831 --> 00:11:13.850
that's how it works.

194
00:11:13.851 --> 00:11:18.500
And then when you rest and when you sleep and when you eat and they grow and I

195
00:11:18.501 --> 00:11:22.520
was like,
and he did,
it still didn't make sense.
So I was like,
okay,
I guess,

196
00:11:22.521 --> 00:11:24.860
you know,
he's like,
you ever heard,
you know when the soreness,

197
00:11:24.861 --> 00:11:27.080
you know when you get the soreness or whatever.
I was like,
yeah.
He was like,

198
00:11:27.081 --> 00:11:29.460
that's like it,
like hurt,
like kind of injured or whatever,

199
00:11:29.461 --> 00:11:32.330
and then it has to heal up and when it heals up,
it heals up bigger.
And I'm like,

200
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:35.930
okay.
It's like,
so you can't bend every day.
Otherwise it'll just like,

201
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:38.960
it'll just won't grow it always be damaged.
I was like,
oh,
makes sense.

202
00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:41.660
So that rest in between workouts,

203
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:46.880
it's kind of important given my goal Grosso muscles,

204
00:11:46.881 --> 00:11:50.210
and you'll see what I'm saying,
where this kind of thing,
where it's like all go,

205
00:11:50.211 --> 00:11:54.260
all go,
no arrest.
Right?
You need that rest to grow literally.

206
00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.900
And that goes for anything.
Truth.
