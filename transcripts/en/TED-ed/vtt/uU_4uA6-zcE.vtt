00:00:14.826 --> 00:00:15.976
How do nerves work?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.976
Are nerves simply the wires in the body

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.143
that conduct electricity, like the wires
in the walls of your home

00:00:21.167 --> 00:00:23.976
or in your computer?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.976
This is an analogy often made,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.976
but the reality is that nerves have
a much more complex job in the body.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.048
They are not just the wires,
but the cells that are the sensors,

00:00:33.072 --> 00:00:35.976
detectors of the external
and internal world,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.976
the transducers that convert
information to electrical impulses,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.976
the wires that transmit these impulses,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.976
the transistors that gate the information

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.976
and turn up or down the volume-

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.976
and finally, the activators
that take that information

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.976
and cause it to have
an effect on other organs.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.976
Consider this. Your mother
gently strokes your forearm

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.976
and you react with pleasure.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.976
Or a spider crawls on your forearm
and you startle and slap it off.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.976
Or you brush your forearm against a hot
rack while removing a cake from the oven

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.976
and you immediately recoil.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.976
Light touch produced
pleasure, fear, or pain.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.976
How can one kind of cell
have so many functions?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.976
Nerves are in fact bundles
of cells called neurons

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.976
and each of these neurons is highly
specialized to carry nerve impulses,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.976
their form of electricity,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.976
in response to only one kind
of stimulus, and in only one direction.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.976
The nerve impulse starts with a receptor,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.976
a specialized part of each nerve,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.976
where the electrical impulse begins.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.976
One nerve's receptor might
be a thermal receptor,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.976
designed only to respond to a rapid
increase in temperature.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.976
Another receptor type is attached
to the hairs of the forearm,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.976
detecting movement of those hairs, such
as when a spider crawls on your skin.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.976
Yet another kind of neuron
is low-threshold mechanoreceptor,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.976
activated by light touch.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.976
Each of these neurons then carry
their specific information:

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.976
pain, warning, pleasure.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.976
And that information is projected
to specific areas of the brain

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.976
and that is the electrical impulse.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.976
The inside of a nerve is a fluid
that is very rich in the ion potassium.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.976
It is 20 times higher
than in the fluid outside the nerve

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.976
while that outside fluid has 10 times
more sodium than the inside of a nerve.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.976
This imbalance between sodium
outside and potassium inside the cell

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.334
results in the inside of the nerve
having a negative electrical charge

00:02:34.358 --> 00:02:36.976
relative to the outside of the nerve,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.976
about equal to -70 or -80 millivolts.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.976
This is called
the nerve's resting potential.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.096
But in response to that stimulus
the nerve is designed to detect,

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.976
pores in the cell wall
near the receptor of the cell open.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.096
These pores are specialized
protein channels

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.976
that are designed to let
sodium rush into the nerve.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.976
The sodium ions rush
down their concentration gradient,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.976
and when they do, the inside of the nerve
becomes more positively charged-

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.976
about +40 millivolts.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.286
While this happens, initially
in the nerve right around the receptor,

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.286
if the change in the nerve's electrical
charge is great enough,

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.976
if it reaches what is called threshold,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.976
the nearby sodium ion channels open,
and then the ones nearby those,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.976
and so on, and so forth,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.976
so that the positivity spreads
along the nerve's membrane

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.976
to the nerve's cell body

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.976
and then along the nerve's long,
thread-like extension, the axon.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.976
Meanwhile, potassium ion channels open,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.976
potassium rushes out of the nerve,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.976
and the membrane voltage
returns to normal.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.976
Actually, overshooting it a bit.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.976
And during this overshoot,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.976
the nerve is resistant to further
depolarization-it is refractory,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.976
which prevents the nerve electrical
impulse from traveling backwards.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.976
Then, ion pumps pump the sodium
back back out of the nerve,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.976
and the potassium back into the nerve,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.976
restoring the nerve to its
normal resting state.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
The end of the nerve, the end of the axon,

00:04:03.024 --> 00:04:04.976
communicates with the nerve's target.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.976
This target will be other nerves
in a specialized area of the spinal cord,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.976
to be processed and then
transmitted up to the brain.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.976
Or the nerve's target may be
another organ, such as a muscle.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.976
When the electrical impulse
reaches the end of the nerve,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.976
small vesicles, or packets, containing
chemical neurotransmitters,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.976
are released by the nerve and rapidly
interact with the nerve's target.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.143
This process is called
synaptic transmission,

00:04:29.167 --> 00:04:32.976
because the connection between the nerve
and the next object in the chain

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.976
is called a synapse. And it
is here, in this synapse,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.976
that the neuron's electrical
information can be modulated,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.976
amplified,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.976
blocked altogether

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
or translated
to another informational process.
