00:00:07.198 --> 00:00:09.219
- I joined LAPD in 1981,

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:10.699
was there during Rodney King,

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:12.539
was there during the riots.

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:15.209
Los Angeles was really the breeding ground

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:17.499
of how to do things right

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:19.649
and how to do things wrong.

00:00:19.649 --> 00:00:21.459
I have seen a lot, and I've learned a lot.

00:00:21.459 --> 00:00:23.698
But I will tell you that school policing

00:00:23.698 --> 00:00:27.878
was a whole different
eye-opening experience for me.

00:00:27.878 --> 00:00:29.768
- So the mindset around
cops in this community,

00:00:29.768 --> 00:00:31.827
if I had to give you an honest opinion,

00:00:31.827 --> 00:00:34.259
it's not a positive one.

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:37.339
We obviously need police to
protect our cities and citizens,

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:40.128
so I definitely think that
there's a place in schools,

00:00:40.128 --> 00:00:43.587
but it has to be a very honest
and working relationship.

00:00:43.587 --> 00:00:45.859
- I started to understand
that there are pieces

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:47.827
to the law enforcement tool box

00:00:47.827 --> 00:00:49.977
that are much more
successful than that gun,

00:00:49.977 --> 00:00:52.398
or the Taser, or the OC spray.

00:00:52.398 --> 00:00:55.207
The biggest weapon that the
police officer is armed with

00:00:55.207 --> 00:00:58.278
that they don't use is their mouth,

00:00:58.278 --> 00:01:01.078
that mouth, that ability
to have a discussion.

00:01:01.078 --> 00:01:05.911
So for me, that SEL component
is really, really important.

00:01:08.078 --> 00:01:10.419
When I went in to roll call,
and I sat the officers down,

00:01:10.419 --> 00:01:12.688
you'd have thought I was
speaking French to them.

00:01:12.688 --> 00:01:14.756
Most police officers across the country

00:01:14.756 --> 00:01:16.796
never understand the complexities

00:01:16.796 --> 00:01:18.688
of what this person is going through,

00:01:18.688 --> 00:01:21.390
understanding life and
all the other nuances

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.640
to why you're there handling that call.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.112
- The typical calls I go
to day to day are fights,

00:01:30.112 --> 00:01:33.529
burglaries, and a major, major calls I go

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.008
to are sexual assaults.

00:01:37.008 --> 00:01:39.579
People bring guns to
school, knives to school.

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:40.829
It's dangerous.

00:01:41.896 --> 00:01:43.278
I grab one cup of coffee,

00:01:43.278 --> 00:01:44.968
and then I head to my assigned school,

00:01:44.968 --> 00:01:49.659
which is Castlemont High
School in East Oakland.

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:50.968
- Historically, over the last few years,

00:01:50.968 --> 00:01:54.269
Castlemont has not been the
first choice of schools.

00:01:54.269 --> 00:01:56.790
This has been more like the last option.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.368
The neighborhood around this area is still

00:01:59.368 --> 00:02:01.808
one of the highest in crime in the city.

00:02:01.808 --> 00:02:04.008
Many of our students go through a lot.

00:02:04.008 --> 00:02:05.507
The challenges that they face

00:02:05.507 --> 00:02:08.888
to get up in the morning
and be at school, focused,

00:02:08.888 --> 00:02:10.998
we try not to make excuses for them.

00:02:10.998 --> 00:02:13.779
We try to teach them to be able

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:16.030
to utilize the folks that are here,

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.207
and it's a work in progress.

00:02:18.207 --> 00:02:19.676
- The chief of police always told us,

00:02:19.676 --> 00:02:22.286
take 10 seconds, breathe,
see what you got,

00:02:22.286 --> 00:02:24.830
assess it, and then we'll go from there.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.078
I've always taken that into mind,

00:02:26.078 --> 00:02:27.699
and maybe I'll talk to the students

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:28.915
and find out the story.

00:02:28.915 --> 00:02:31.379
I try to share my experiences with them

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.470
on some of the same experience
that they're going through.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.458
I try to get them help.

00:02:34.458 --> 00:02:36.829
I try to counsel them.

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:38.299
- Although he wears a uniform

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.510
and his job is a police officer,

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.619
we view Officer Singh as
a Castlemont staff member,

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:44.918
partly because of his efforts

00:02:44.918 --> 00:02:47.379
to really build relationships
with folks here.

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:49.219
And it really has changed the landscape

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:52.590
of how many of our students
think of the police.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.408
- My friendship with Officer
Singh has changed my outlook.

00:02:56.408 --> 00:02:59.504
Just remembering that police
officers are people too.

00:02:59.504 --> 00:03:01.038
He's just like me.

00:03:01.038 --> 00:03:02.558
He's a pretty cool guy.

00:03:02.558 --> 00:03:05.630
I do believe that he makes a
great effort to meet people

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.019
and get to know them
on a one-to-one level.

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.497
- I believe the approach that we take

00:03:10.497 --> 00:03:12.550
here at Castlemont is a true example

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.078
of how police and schools
can work together,

00:03:15.078 --> 00:03:18.648
where the focus is not,
okay, let me be punitive,

00:03:18.648 --> 00:03:19.968
and let me punish kids,

00:03:19.968 --> 00:03:22.695
but more so, how can I support kids?

00:03:22.695 --> 00:03:25.568
- If you can't understand and
have empathy for these kids

00:03:25.568 --> 00:03:27.998
and these families, you're not
going to be very successful.

00:03:27.998 --> 00:03:29.424
And that has nothing to do with Oakland.

00:03:29.424 --> 00:03:31.499
It could be Los Angeles,
it could be anywhere.

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:33.568
Going to radio calls and arresting people

00:03:33.568 --> 00:03:35.579
and throwing them in jail is not working,

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:36.547
and we all know that.

00:03:36.547 --> 00:03:40.380
And I would not have
said that to you in 1982.
