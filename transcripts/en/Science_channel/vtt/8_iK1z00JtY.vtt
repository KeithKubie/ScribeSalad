THIS THAW-AND-SERVE LEMON TART

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:12.244
HAS A SHORTBREAD SHELL
AND CREAMY LEMON FILLING

00:00:12.244 --> 00:00:14.414
TOPPED WITH BUTTERCREAM.

00:00:18.384 --> 00:00:21.320
EACH BATCH OF DOUGH PRODUCED
IN THIS INDUSTRIAL MIXER

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.990
YIELDS 449 TART SHELLS.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.394
THE FIRST STEP IS TO LIGHTLY
BLEND MARGARINE, SUGAR, AND SALT

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:30.296
FOR TWO OR THREE MINUTES.

00:00:32.132 --> 00:00:34.100
NEXT, ADD PASTEURIZED EGGS,

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.403
AND MIX FOR ABOUT TWO MINUTES
AT SLOW SPEED.

00:00:37.403 --> 00:00:42.241
FAST MIXING MAKES THE DOUGH
TOO TIGHT, CAUSING IT TO CRACK.

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:47.347
THEY ADD WHITE FLOUR
WHILE CONTINUING TO MIX SLOWLY,

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:49.716
UNTIL THE INGREDIENTS
ARE WELL-BLENDED.

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:54.053
ONCE THE DOUGH IS READY,
WORKERS PUT IT THROUGH

00:00:54.053 --> 00:00:57.890
WHAT IS ACTUALLY A
HAMBURGER-FORMING MACHINE.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.893
IT EXTRUDES
1/4-POUND DOUGH PATTIES.

00:01:00.893 --> 00:01:04.597
WORKERS PLACE THEM IN THE MIDDLE
OF A NON-STICK ALUMINUM TART PAN

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:06.032
THREE AT A TIME.

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:12.137
THEY MOUNT THE PAN ON A PRESS,
COVERING IT WITH PLASTIC.

00:01:12.137 --> 00:01:13.606
A DIE STRIKES THE PAN,

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:16.376
FLATTENING AND SPREADING
THE DOUGH EVENLY.

00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:23.582
THE PANS GO INTO THE OVEN, WHERE
THEY ROTATE FOR 23 TO 24 MINUTES

00:01:23.582 --> 00:01:26.419
AT 350 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:28.554
THE DEPOSITOR IS PRE-SET

00:01:28.554 --> 00:01:32.926
TO SQUIRT 22 OUNCES
OF LEMON FILLING IN EACH TART.

00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:43.069
THE FILLED TARTS GO
INTO THE OVEN FOR 11 MINUTES.

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:45.438
THE LEMON TARTS
COME OUT OF THE OVEN,

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:48.374
COOL AT ROOM TEMPERATURE
FOR TWO TO THREE HOURS,

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:51.844
THEN GO INTO A FREEZER
OVERNIGHT.

00:01:51.844 --> 00:01:58.451
THE NEXT DAY, WORKERS REMOVE
THE FROZEN TARTS FROM THE PANS.

00:02:06.258 --> 00:02:09.728
NEXT, THEY PUT THE TART
IN AN AUTOMATED CAKE SLICER.

00:02:09.728 --> 00:02:14.934
THE TURNTABLE ROTATES AS
THE TART IS CUT INTO 12 SLICES,

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:18.738
WITH PAPERS IN BETWEEN EACH ONE.

00:02:18.738 --> 00:02:21.608
THIS IS FOR RESTAURANTS WHO
SERVE THE DESSERT BY THE SLICE.

00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:26.446
WORKERS EMBELLISH EACH SLICE

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:28.714
WITH A FLOWER
MADE OF BUTTERCREAM --

00:02:28.714 --> 00:02:31.718
A DECADENT MIXTURE OF BUTTER,
EGG WHITES, AND SUGAR.

00:02:35.654 --> 00:02:37.190
THEY COMPLETE EACH FLOWER

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.792
WITH A DOT OF LEMON FILLING
IN THE CENTER.

00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:45.665
THIS LEMON TART IS FINISHED.
