00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.330
Let z1 and z2 be two
distinct complex numbers.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.210
And let z equal,
and they say it's

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.080
"1 minus t times z1 plus t times
z2, for some real number with t

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.700
being between 0 and 1."

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.610
And they say, "If the argument
w denotes the principal argument

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.190
of a nonzero complex
number w, then?"

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.730
And we know the argument is the
angle of kind of the position

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.290
vector specifying the complex
number of the complex plane,

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.184
and the real axis.

00:00:28.184 --> 00:00:29.100
Let me just draw that.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.080
So if we do an Argand diagram,
this is the imaginary axis.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.310
And this is the real axis.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.680
If this is our complex
number, if that is z,

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.000
it's argument--
the argument of z--

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.280
is going to be this
angle right over here.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.430
So phi is equal to
the argument of z.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.200
That's all they're telling
us in this second part.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.660
Now, let's go through each of
these and see are they true.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.710
And just to be
clear, this is one

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.960
of those problems where more
than one of these choices

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:57.690
might be correct.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.510
So let's see if they're true.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.959
So let's first figure out what
the magnitude of z minus z1 is.

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:08.870
So the magnitude
of z minus z1 is

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.940
going to be the magnitude of--
so let me write-- this is going

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.900
to be the magnitude of--
let's do the z part first.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.030
Let me write in the same colors.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.830
So if I would just
focus on the z first,

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.010
z is this thing up here.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.510
And let me distribute the z1.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:31.630
So it's z1 minus tz1 minus
tz1, and then plus tz2.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.160
And from that, we
want to subtract z1.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.780
So from that, we want to
subtract z1, so minus Z1.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.980
And that and that cancel out.

00:01:47.777 --> 00:01:48.360
And let's see.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.490
We can factor out a t over here.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.450
So this is going to be equal to
the magnitude of-- let's factor

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.110
out a t times z2 minus z1.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.490
So that is the
magnitude of z minus z1,

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.270
this first term over here.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.430
Let's figure out the
magnitude of z minus z2.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.610
I'm going to color
code it. z minus z2

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.610
is equal to the
magnitude-- well,

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.040
z is just this thing up here.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.140
Let me just write it out.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:36.370
So it is 1 minus t times z1
plus t times z2, that's z.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.964
And from that, we want to
subtract z2, so minus z2.

00:02:41.964 --> 00:02:43.130
So what can we do over here?

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.740
We can take a t minus
1 out from here.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.970
We can factor out the z2
out of these two terms.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.470
So this is going to be
equal to the magnitude of 1

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:03.360
minus t times z1,
1 minus t times z1.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.470
That's this term
right over here.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:16.320
Plus-- let me do it in another
color-- plus t minus 1,

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.080
times z2.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.122
The magnitude of this part over
here is this thing over there.

00:03:25.122 --> 00:03:26.580
Now, let's see what
happens when we

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.890
add this thing to this thing.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.390
That's what choice A is doing.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.980
We're adding this
thing to this thing.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.010
Let's see if we can simplify it.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.630
So this becomes the absolute
value, or the magnitude,

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:46.090
of t times z2 minus z1 plus--
I'll do the whole thing here

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.600
in magenta-- plus
this thing over here.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.050
And this thing over here--
actually, before I even

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.460
write it out-- how
can we simplify that?

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.720
We'll have a 1 minus
t and a t minus 1.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.320
Well, I'll just
write it out here.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.111
But I'm going to change
it up a little bit.

00:04:00.111 --> 00:04:02.000
So this is equal
to the magnitude

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.490
of 1 minus t times z1.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.000
And so that I have
a 1 minus t here,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.791
I'm just going to put
a negative out front.

00:04:11.791 --> 00:04:15.220
So minus 1, minus t,
I just swapped them.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.920
Negative 1 minus t is the
same thing as positive t

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.589
minus 1, z2.

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:23.670
And then this thing over here,
since I have the 1 minus t

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.440
out there, this
becomes the magnitude

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.241
of, I'm just factoring
out the 1 minus t,

00:04:28.241 --> 00:04:32.670
1 minus t times z1 minus z2.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.340
So we have this thing.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.210
Let me copy and paste it.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.810
So, copy and paste.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.810
We have this thing
plus this thing.

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.800
This is what this expression
A has simplified to.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.530
Now let's see if we can
simplify that even more.

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.440
Let's see if we can
simplify it even more.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.180
So t is just a scalar.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.270
And t is between 0 and 1.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.440
They have told us that over
here, t is between 0 and 1.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.720
So this is positive.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.880
This right here is
a positive value.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.370
And then this right here is also
going to be a positive value.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.605
t is greater than 0,
and it is less than 1.

00:05:15.605 --> 00:05:17.480
So this is also going
to be a positive value.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.860
And these are just scalars.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.050
So this is going to
be the same thing.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.087
These are just
scaling the magnitude.

00:05:23.087 --> 00:05:24.670
So this is going to
be the same thing.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.380
These are positive values.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.602
So this is going to be t times
the absolute value-- actually

00:05:30.602 --> 00:05:31.560
let me not skip a step.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.893
This is going to be the same
thing as the absolute value

00:05:33.893 --> 00:05:38.840
of t times the absolute
value of z2 minus z1--

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.460
because this is
just scaling it--

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:48.770
plus the absolute
value of 1 minus t,

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.980
times the absolute
value of z1 minus z2.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.600
Now let me be clear, the
absolute value of z1 minus z2

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.240
is going to be equal to the
absolute value of z2 minus z1.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.739
These vectors are just pointing
in different directions,

00:06:02.739 --> 00:06:03.780
or these complex numbers.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.702
One is just the
negative of the other.

00:06:05.702 --> 00:06:07.660
But their absolute values,
or their magnitudes,

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.100
are going to be the same.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.050
So let me write z2 minus z1, the
absolute value of z2 minus z1,

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.550
there.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:14.660
And the reason why
I'm doing it is

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:15.900
so I get the same thing here.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.320
And I can factor it out.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.940
So the absolute
value of z1 minus z1

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.660
is the same thing as
the absolute value

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.760
of z1 minus z2,
because it's just

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.760
going in the other direction.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.380
Now, what can we do here?

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.460
Well, the absolute
value of t, remember

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.875
t is positive, so this is
just going to be equal to t.

00:06:34.875 --> 00:06:37.000
The absolute value of 1
minus t, once again, that's

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.650
positive, so that's just
going to be 1 minus t.

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.800
So we can factor
this business out.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:50.360
So we're going to
get t plus 1 minus t,

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.970
times the absolute
value of z2 minus z1.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.720
Now, the t's cancel out here.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.980
We just got a one out front.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:06.210
So this is just equal to the
absolute value of z2 minus z1.

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:08.890
So we see that
choice A does work.

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:12.620
This plus this does
indeed equal that.

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:13.910
I'm going to leave you there.

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.326
And in the next
video, we're going

00:07:15.326 --> 00:07:17.410
to try out some of these
other possibilities

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.740
to see if they
might also be true.
