00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:08.060
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.480
I promised a video about
limits and continuous

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.370
functions and here it is.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:23.530
So I'll begin with the most
basic idea and with a picture

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.730
instead of definition in symbols
first. So the most

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.710
basic idea is that I have
a bunch of numbers--

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.330
let's make them positive
numbers--

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.440
and I want to know, what
does it mean for them

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.220
to approach a limit--

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.580
capital A--

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.810
as I go out this sequence of
numbers, a1, a2, a3, a4.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.100
And let me say right away, the
first four numbers, the first

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.320
million numbers, make no
difference about the limit.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.080
So here's what it means.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.970
For example, there's a
equals 7, let's say.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.190
What does it mean for these
numbers to approach 7?

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:13.840
It means that if I take any thin
little space around a,

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.450
above and below, the numbers
can start out whatever.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.170
They can go in there, they could
go out, they could come

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.880
back, whatever, they could
grow way big, way small.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.700
But in the end, beyond some
point, eventually, they have

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.310
to get in that slit
and stay in there.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.680
And the slit, then,
could be smaller.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.220
And then they would have to get
into that smaller slit and

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.470
stay there.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.510
So that's what it means for
the numbers to approach A,

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:56.660
that eventually after any number
of jogs around, they

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.660
get inside and they stay
there, however

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.370
thin that slit is.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.180
A slight difference when
a is 0, because

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.870
the numbers are positive.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.110
They're coming down,
they get in.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.920
And again, they must stay in.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.650
And then, again, I'm going to
make the band tighter, and

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.950
they have to get into
that and stay there.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.020
And what does it mean for the
numbers to approach infinity?

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.270
That means that whatever--

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.080
so this is often
called epsilon.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.820
I'll use that Greek
letter epsilon as

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.290
a very small number.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.100
So this would be A minus
epsilon, and this would be A

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.500
plus epsilon.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.010
And then the epsilon could
be made smaller.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.770
And now here is some
big number,

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.800
like even 1 over epsilon.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.890
So that's a giant number.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.810
And the limit is infinity if,
again, they can dodge around

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.060
for a while, they can go
down, they can go up.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.160
But eventually, they
must get above that

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.230
line and stay there.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.190
And if I move the line up
further, they have to get

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.770
above that line for me to
say that the limit is--

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.460
so I have these possible
limits.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.180
Infinite, some positive,
ordinary number, and 0.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.630
Those are possible limits.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.570
But of course many sequences
have no limit at all, like

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.280
sine of n, it will just bounce
around, cosine n--

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.700
many, many things.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:33.590
OK.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:42.280
So I think that the way to get
the idea, use the idea, is to

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.880
ask some questions
about limits.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.570
And we'll see that usually the
answer is yes, OK, no problem.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.900
But once in a while, for certain
limits are dangerous.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.250
So really always mathematicians
are looking for

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.370
what's special, what unusual
thing could happen?

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.980
Because the truth is, limits are
ordinarily rather boring.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:19.220
If the an's approach 7 and the
bn's approach 4, so the a's

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.220
get close to 7 and the b's get
close to 4, then their

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.020
differences will get
close to 7 minus 4.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.930
But is there any case in
which that could fail?

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.940
Is there any case among these
in which we could not know

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.140
what the limit was, and it might
not exist, or it might

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:47.040
be like any number?

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.400
And I think that can happen
in this, so I've got four

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.570
different questions
here, getting more

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.430
interesting as we go down.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.350
In the first one, I can
see only one problem.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.770
If the a's approach infinity, so
they get very big, and the

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.860
b's also approach infinity, get
very big, so capital A and

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:21.010
capital B become formally
infinity minus infinity, and

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.180
we don't know the
answer there.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.890
That has no meaning.

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.780
So this'll be my little
list of danger.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.660
I mean, it's not like
skydiving, but for a

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.260
mathematician this
is high risk.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.760
OK, so how could this happen?

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.890
Well, the an might
be n squared.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.230
And the bn might be only n.

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.230
Right?

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.320
So they're both going to
infinity, n squared and n.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.820
But n squared is going faster.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.590
It's like a race.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.590
n squared will win, and the
difference between them will

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.670
actually grow faster
and faster.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.410
Or they could go to
infinity together.

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:10.110
an and bn could both be n,
both headed for infinity.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:14.640
The differences would be
0 all along, n minus n.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.550
So the limit of the difference
would be 0 minus 0.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.060
So this could be 0, but it could
be infinity, it could be

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.410
minus infinity, it could
be anything.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.686
Any limit is possible there.

00:06:25.686 --> 00:06:29.610
Do you see that there
is a case--

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.800
it's sort of a special case,
because it only happens when

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.840
these limits are infinite--

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:41.110
but now it's sort of OK
to look at each--

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.230
let me look at number two.

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:46.240
How about multiplication?

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.850
If I multiply a bunch of numbers
that are headed for 7

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.540
and a bunch of numbers that
are headed for 4, their

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.540
product is going
to head for 28.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.650
This will be true.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.960
When could it fail?

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:06.410
Well, again, it's going to be
extreme cases, because if I

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.270
have ordinary numbers for
A and B like 7 and

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.690
4, there's no doubt.

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:19.440
But look at the extreme
case of when A

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.685
is 0 and B is infinite.

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.690
So the an's are headed for 0.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:32.600
The bn's are getting bigger
and bigger, the an's are

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:37.000
getting small as we
go far enough out.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:37.690
OK.

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:42.490
In that case, well,
again it's a race.

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:46.680
The an's might be 1 over
n squared, and the

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.250
bn's might be n.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:53.840
So this would be n over
n squared, and

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.790
that would go to 0.

00:07:55.790 --> 00:08:03.960
But if I reverse those I could
have n squared times 1 over n.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.780
The product could get bigger,
or the product could--

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.480
all possibilities.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.940
All possibilities there.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.250
So I cannot know what
that one is.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:15.080
0 times infinity
is meaningless.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:15.810
OK.

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:17.680
What about number three?

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.610
The danger increases as soon
as we start dividing.

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:27.080
I made the b's positive,
but I don't know if

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.650
capital B is positive.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:29.960
So the danger--

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:35.110
and, in fact, the most important
case for calculus--

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:38.480
is 0 over 0.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:43.210
If the a's go to 0 and the b's
go to 0, I can't tell what

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:49.430
their ratio goes to, because it
depends how fast they go.

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:53.950
If the a's go quickly to 0 and
the b's are rather slow

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:55.260
getting there--

00:08:55.260 --> 00:09:00.060
in other words the b's would be
a lot bigger than the a's

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.050
even though both are
going to 0--

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:04.730
then that fraction
would be small.

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:07.750
But if I reverse them, the
fraction would be large.

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:11.180
So I think 0 over
0 is a danger.

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:15.290
I think there's another
danger here.

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:17.540
Yeah, maybe infinity
over infinity.

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:25.810
Again, that's a race that we
can't tell, until we know

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:29.220
details about the sequences,
who's going to win.

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:32.530
If they an's go off to infinity
and the bn's go off

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:35.910
to infinity, ah, a very
important case.

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:39.710
The ratio could be
1 all along.

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:43.420
The a's and b's could be the
same, headed for infinity.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:48.380
Or the an's might be squaring
the b's and going up faster,

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.195
or the square root of the
b's and going slower.

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:58.510
So again, infinity over
infinity, we can't--

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:04.250
0 over infinity, if the a's are
headed for 0 and the b's

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:08.400
are headed big, then that ratio
is going to be small and

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.310
head for 0.

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:11.430
0 over infinity, I'm OK with.

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:13.640
Call it 0.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.350
Well, I don't know if
that's legal, but

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:16.870
anyway, let me do it.

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:20.060
All right, last one of
this kind, just for

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:21.520
practice about limits.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.990
Again, you see what I'm
constantly doing is thinking

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:32.010
of examples that simply
show that I can't

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:33.370
be sure of the limit.

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:38.600
So here normally I could be
sure, if this is headed for 7

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:42.340
to the fourth, that'll be the
limit, whatever that is, 49

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:47.510
squared, 2401, or something.

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:49.680
But if--

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.160
now when could it go wrong?

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.990
Here's an interesting case.

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:58.420
So this is my list of danger,
and I think I'm in danger if

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:01.000
they both go to 0.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.400
0 to the 0-th power, I don't
know what that is.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:09.210
And actually, I don't know all
the possibilities here.

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:19.020
I can see one way would be let's
suppose the b's were

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:22.340
actually 0, or practically.

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:26.550
Then things to the
0 power are 1.

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:32.180
So I could get the answer 1 here
by fixing the b's at 0

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:35.860
and letting these guys, they
would all be to the 0 power,

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:37.440
so they would all be 1.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.945
And in the limit,
I would have 1.

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:44.440
But I could also do
it differently.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:49.610
I could fix these at 0 and let
these guys get smaller.

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:52.220
Then I would have 0 to powers.

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.610
And zero to any power is 0.

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:56.400
You see my little
problem here?

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.190
Let me write my little
problem here.

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:03.620
My problem is that a to the 0
power would be 1, but 0 to the

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:09.435
a-th power would be 0, or 0 to
the b-th, maybe I should say.

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:16.840
So if I'm in this situation and
the a is shrinking to 0, I

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.680
still have a limit of 1's.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.660
But if I'm in this situation and
the b's are headed for 0,

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:22.740
I have a limit of 0's.

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:26.540
And maybe you could get
1/2, I don't know how.

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:31.370
And you have to allow me--
because I have to finish this

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:34.540
list, and I only have one
more to tell you--

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:39.120
that another case, a very
interesting type of calculus

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:44.020
case is the case where
the a's go to 1 and

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:45.345
the b's go to infinity.

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:53.640
I don't know if you remember
that this actually happened in

00:12:53.640 --> 00:13:00.140
the lecture on e, the number
that comes in e to the x, the

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:01.670
great number of calculus.

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:03.440
Do you remember that?

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.920
So I'm going to talk a little
bit about the a's going to 1

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:10.120
and the b's blowing up.

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.960
So I'm getting things that are
very near 1, but I'm taking

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.830
many, many more of them.

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:17.350
And I believe that I can
get all kinds of

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:19.710
different limits there.

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:22.180
I believe I can get all kinds
of different limits.

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:23.120
Do you just--

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.180
maybe on this next board.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:32.710
And then I promise to come
back to the heart of the

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:36.270
subject of limits and continuous
functions.

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:44.920
But I just think that one, the
famous case of this one, was 1

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.060
plus 1 over n.

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:51.200
That's the a's, and that
approaches what limit?

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.810
One.

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:56.120
The b's I'm going
to take as n.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.460
So the b's are going
to infinity.

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:01.240
So I'm discussing
this case here.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:03.150
So that's a case where
this goes to 1,

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:04.260
this goes to infinity.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.992
I had an email this week saying,
wait a minute, I've

00:14:07.992 --> 00:14:10.540
got a little problem here,
because I know 1 to the

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:14.060
infinity is e.

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:15.840
1 to the infinity is 3.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:23.050
Well, that's because it's true
that that number approaches e.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:27.640
That's one of the many
remarkable ways to produce the

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.640
number e, the 2.7-something.

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:37.210
But that's because the race
between this and this was so

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:38.460
evenly balanced.

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:46.360
If I took these closer and
closer to 1, like n squared,

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.420
what would happen then?

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:52.070
Then I'm taking numbers very,
very near 1, I'm taking a

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:55.530
power, but these are sort of
near, those would approach--

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:58.660
would you like to guess?

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:00.820
One.

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.990
These are so close to 1 that
taking the nth power doesn't

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:05.690
move them far.

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:12.070
And you can guess that I could
get infinity too, by taking n

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:14.860
not still close to 1
and taking some big

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:18.950
power like n squared.

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:21.950
Now I have things close to 1,
but I'm taking so many of them

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:23.200
that it would blow up.

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:29.120
So again i think--So those are
all cases where in the limit,

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.780
I have 1, in the limit,
I have infinity.

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:41.620
But that combination 1 to the
increasingly high powers can

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:43.790
do different things.

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:49.790
This was my little idea to
show you the risky cases.

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:50.820
OK.

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:57.960
But actually, 0 over 0, that's
what calculus is

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.290
always doing, right?

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:04.730
Because that's exactly what we
have when we have a delta f

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:08.310
over a delta x, a delta
y over a delta x.

00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:14.010
They're both approaching 0 and
we get a definite slope when

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:17.420
the ratio goes to
a good number.

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:18.340
OK.

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:21.980
So can I discuss 0 over 0?

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:25.530
All right, phooey on this one.

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:26.250
OK.

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:32.560
So I now want to speak
about the case when f

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.810
of x goes to 0.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:41.080
Let's say f of x goes
to 0 as x goes to 0.

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:45.570
So there'll be an if here.

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:48.680
I have to say what that means.

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:55.430
And then I'm also going to have
some g of x going to 0 as

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:57.760
x goes to 0.

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:02.210
OK, so both functions
are decreasing.

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:07.530
And my question, let me ask the
question first, what about

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:09.740
f of x over g of x?

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:14.150
What does that do?

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:22.499
And of course, just as I said
up there, I can't tell yet.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.510
I have to know the
f and the g.

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:31.190
It's a race to 0, and I have to
know who's the winner and

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:32.710
by how much.

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:36.450
But first, I'd better say what
does it mean for a function to

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:38.900
go to 0 as x goes to 0.

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.230
Well, you know.

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:44.140
Let me draw a graph
of this function.

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:45.690
OK, I'll just draw it.

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:47.390
So f of x is going to 0.

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:54.140
So here is x, and I'm going to
graph f of x, and here is 0.

00:17:54.140 --> 00:18:00.850
So as x is coming down to 0, my
f of x is also coming to 0.

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:05.350
So it could come like so.

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:10.460
That's a pretty sensible,
smooth, nice approach to 0.

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:14.300
That could be my f of x.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:21.400
And it may be a g of x is
smaller, but also approaching

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.590
0 in a nice, smooth way.

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:29.720
This is a case where
you can see those,

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.020
as x goes that way--

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:34.680
maybe the arrow should be going
that way, because x is

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.590
going to 0--

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:41.690
my f of x is getting smaller, my
g of x is getting smaller.

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:46.090
And I'll say exactly what
that means, but you

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:47.320
know what it means.

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:51.750
It means that if I put a little,
like these lines, if I

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:56.160
put a little band there,
it gets into that band.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.610
Actually, g will get into
the band sooner.

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:03.300
But then f will safely
get into the band.

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:08.760
Now, the question is what about
f of x over g of x?

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.510
OK.

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:11.660
Can we say?

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:16.840
Now, I'm going to suppose
that f of x has a

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:20.100
definite slope, s.

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.975
And this one has a definite
slope, t.

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:26.998
In other words, I am
going to suppose--

00:19:26.998 --> 00:19:32.950
Here look, this is called,
named after a French guy,

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:38.470
L'Hopital, the hospital rule.

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:49.320
OK, so it's just a little trick,
because this comes up

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:54.320
of what's happening
in this race to 0.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:20:01.280
And the natural idea is that f
of x is really, since f is 0

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:05.820
there, and I'm really just
going a little way.

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:11.170
So maybe I call that delta x,
just to emphasize that I'm

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:14.220
looking really near 0.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:18.030
And that f of x is really
going to be delta f.

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:25.030
And that g of x is really going
to be delta g, because

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:30.460
let me draw the picture,
delta f is that height.

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:32.450
Here is delta x, and
here is the height.

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:35.790
It's because that
point is 0, 0.

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:45.530
So the differences I'm taking,
the f of x in the delta, the f

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:50.530
of x plus delta x is just f at
delta x, just that height.

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:51.970
And g is this smaller one.

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:59.150
Do you have an idea of what
this answer's going to be?

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:05.020
If I look at that ratio of this

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:06.630
function to this function--

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:09.740
here the ratio, I don't know
what, 3 or something.

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:13.920
Here it's, I don't know,
maybe 4, maybe more.

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:21.120
As I'm getting closer and
closer, this height is

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.690
controlled by the slope.

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:27.770
And this height, the g of x,
is controlled by its slope.

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:30.060
Look, here is the
way to see it.

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:35.620
Just divide top and
bottom by delta x.

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.120
Same thing.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:41.140
So I haven't changed
anything yet.

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:45.480
I divided the top and the
bottom by delta x, just

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:53.010
because now I'll let everything
go to 0, delta x

00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:56.040
will go to 0, the delta f will
go to 0, so the delta

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.130
g will go to 0.

00:21:57.130 --> 00:22:01.200
But I know what this
approaches.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:08.490
Delta f over delta x approaches
the slope, s.

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:15.190
And delta g over delta x
approaches the other slope, t.

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:22.670
So you see, this is L'Hopital's
rule, that if f

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:29.280
goes to 0, and if g goes to 0,
and if they have nice slopes,

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:34.910
then the ratio of f to g, which
looks like 0 over 0, we

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:39.280
can actually tell what it is by
looking at the derivative,

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:40.970
by looking at those slopes.

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:44.520
It's the ratio of the slopes.

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:46.470
OK, that takes a little
thought and, of

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:48.920
course, some practices.

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:54.400
It also takes some examples to
show what else could happen.

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:59.320
Can I just draw another f,
and you tell me what

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:00.900
about f over g.

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:03.970
I'm sorry to give you all these
questions, but it's

00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:07.830
example, answer, that you
get the hang of slopes.

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:10.670
Suppose f goes much steeper.

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:13.580
I mean, f could be the
square root of x.

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:16.820
There's f equal the
square root of x.

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:21.260
Square root of x has an
infinite slope at 0.

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:29.340
It's a good function to know,
the square root of x, because

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:32.920
this is x to the 1/2 power.

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:37.640
And its derivative, its slope,
we know will be 1/2 x to the

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.640
minus 1/2 power.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.270
And then as x goes to
0, that blows up the

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:45.290
way the picture shows.

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:53.640
Now, what would f over g, so
this is a case where f hasn't

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.460
got a slope.

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:58.520
The slope is infinite now.
s is now infinite.

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:02.200
And that ratio is going
to blow up.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:07.443
This one is getting
to 0 but slowly.

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:15.280
This f is staying much bigger
than the g, and the ratio

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:16.190
would be infinite.

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:21.740
So there's a case where
L'Hopital can't help because

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:26.280
f, this slope s, which was fine
for this nice function,

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:29.000
is not fine for this function.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.480
The slope is infinite for that
square root function.

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:39.550
OK, a bunch of examples that
begin to show what can happen

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:45.070
and the need, really, for a
little bit of care on what

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:46.460
does it mean?

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:49.650
What would I say about that
square root function?

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:56.220
So I'll even write
that down here.

00:24:56.220 --> 00:25:00.970
f of x equals square root
of x at x equals 0.

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:04.880
What would I say about
that function that

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.800
we know it's picture?

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:10.120
I would say it has
infinite slope.

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:16.330
Or if you prefer, its slope
is not defined.

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:19.090
We don't have a good number
there for its slope.

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:27.350
But I would still say the
function is continuous because

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:34.440
the darn thing does get
below any band.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:38.240
If I draw a little band here,
the function does get into

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:41.080
that band and stay inside.

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.110
It just took a long time.

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:45.700
It stayed out of that band as
long as it could and then

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:48.560
finally fell in just
at the last minute.

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:53.910
OK, so I would say this function
has the slope not

00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:59.960
defined, not OK at x equals 0.

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:13.510
But f of x is continuous
at x equals 0.

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:23.920
So I'm trying to make the
distinction between asking for

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:30.110
the function to be continuous
is not asking as much.

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:35.410
If a function's got a nice
slope, like g, that function's

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:36.590
got to be continuous.

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:39.130
And more, it has to have
this good slope.

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:43.760
This f of x, this square root
function will be continuous.

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:46.590
And now I have to tell you
what continuous means.

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:51.150
It's not asking for so much as
a slope, because the slope

00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:56.850
could come down infinitely
at the last minute.

00:26:56.850 --> 00:27:00.660
All right, so what's a
continuous function?

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:02.260
Continuous function means--

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:13.560
a continuous function, f of x,
at some point-- maybe here it

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:18.190
was 0, I'd better allow
any old point.

00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:32.890
So in words, it means f of
x approaches f of a as x

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:36.330
approaches a.

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:39.430
That's what it means to be
continuous at that point.

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:42.890
It means that there is
a number, a value

00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:44.520
for f at that point.

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:49.600
And we approach that value as
we get near that point.

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:52.040
That seems such a
natural idea.

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:54.850
That's what it means for a
function to be continuous.

00:27:54.850 --> 00:28:00.080
And with this piece of chalk
or with your pen, it means

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:04.650
that I can draw the function
without lifting my pen.

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:10.060
Of course, it could do
some weird stuff.

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:11.860
OK, let me just draw here.

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:16.860
So here's a point, a, and here
is my function, f, and

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:18.150
there is f of a.

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:21.540
So I'm saying that the function
could come along, it

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:25.350
could come down pretty steeply,
but it will get to

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:26.070
that point.

00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:30.070
It might go on, steeper below,
or it might turn back.

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:31.860
Or it might be level.

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:39.330
But I can draw the whole
thing continuously.

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:44.290
But now that description
with a piece of

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:47.410
chalk isn't quite enough.

00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:51.870
And there's a formal definition

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:54.220
that I have to explain.

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:59.050
And it involves this same
idea of epsilon, this

00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:01.520
same idea of a strip.

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:10.080
It means that if I take a little
strip around f of a--

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:17.340
so here's f of a plus a little
bit, and here's f of a minus a

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:19.730
little bit--

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:21.200
then that's continuous.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.110
That function is continuous,
because--

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:27.110
now, remember, epsilon could
be smaller than I drew it,

00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:30.810
smaller than I can draw it,
but still positive.

00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:35.390
Then the requirement is that it
has to get near a, it has

00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:37.560
to get inside that band
and stay there.

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:41.620
It can bounce all
over the place.

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:47.480
But near the point, it's
got to get close.

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:53.780
And now, how do I express that
in terms of epsilon?

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:58.960
OK, well, there's a famous
description.

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:02.685
Yeah, what do I mean by get in
there and stay in there?

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:06.330
Ah!

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:08.950
Can I just make a story?

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:12.850
I'm going to use two Greek
letters, epsilon and delta,

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:16.290
hated by all calculus students
and professors

00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:17.780
too, if they're truthful.

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:23.750
OK, so the story goes,
we choose a band.

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:34.060
Ah, since their Greek letters,
Socrates chooses epsilon.

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:35.580
OK.

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:37.160
So he's going to make it hard.

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:40.580
He's going to make a
narrow band there.

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:44.380
And then the function has got to
get into that band and stay

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:47.790
there, close to a.

00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:51.530
OK, so what do I mean
by close to a?

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:54.430
Well, that's where
delta comes in.

00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:58.920
That's, let's say, Socrates's
student, Plato.

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:10.670
Then Plato can pick his number,
delta, which will be

00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:12.730
the width--

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:19.540
see, he says, OK, if you get
really close, I've got you.

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:23.610
So he's trying to
please Socrates.

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:29.720
So he says, woo, sorry, a had
better be in there somewhere.

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:34.670
Now these bands are getting so
close, my a is, of course--

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:40.840
this is really a plus delta, and
this guy is a minus delta.

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:42.090
Are you kind of with me?

00:31:44.780 --> 00:32:02.720
The logic goes, for any epsilon
chosen by Socrates,

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:11.950
Plato can find a positive
delta--

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:15.030
epsilon, of course, was some
positive number, delta might

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:18.100
be an extremely small
positive number--

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:27.400
so that if the distance
to a is smaller

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:30.450
than Plato's distance--

00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:32.750
so if we're in that
vertical band--

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:36.430
then we're in Socrates's
horizontal band.

00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:44.770
Then this f of x minus f
of a is below epsilon.

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:54.730
So Socrates sets up any tough
requirement, any horizontal

00:32:54.730 --> 00:32:58.670
band, and then Plato meets
that requirement, if the

00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:05.980
function is continuous, by
choosing a vertical band that

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:08.480
keeps everything inside
Socrates's band.

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:09.960
Do you see that?

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.960
Well, it takes some thought.

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:17.210
It takes some practice, and as
always, it's not usually very

00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:19.940
hard to tell if a function
is continuous.

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:22.120
Let me show you one
that isn't.

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:24.340
A famous function that
is not continuous.

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:34.390
Here's the sine of 1 over
x as x going to 0.

00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:39.650
What happens to the sine of
1 over x when x goes to 0?

00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:43.620
Well, the sine, we know,
oscillates minus 1, plus 1,

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:45.270
minus 1, plus 1.

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:51.150
But when it's a sine of 1 over
x, that oscillation really

00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:56.730
takes off, because if x gets
small, 1 over x is quickly

00:33:56.730 --> 00:33:57.500
getting larger.

00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:02.340
You're running along the sine
curve in a faster and faster

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:03.120
and faster way.

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.050
I can't draw it.

00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:05.570
Here's 0.

00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:12.230
But it's not staying
inside a band.

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:17.239
Even with epsilon equalling 1/2,
Socrates has got Plato.

00:34:17.239 --> 00:34:23.900
Plato can't keep it in a band of
1/2 up and 1/2 down because

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:25.159
the sine doesn't stay there.

00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:27.679
So there's a function that's
not continuous.

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:31.320
I could make it continuous by
changing the function a

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:34.080
little, maybe x times
sine of 1 over x.

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:40.480
That would bring the
oscillations down and work.

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.650
So there you go.

00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:44.690
That's epsilon and delta.

00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:46.790
And it takes a little
practice.

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:49.980
And I just have to remember--

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:58.500
when you feel that the whole
thing is a bad experience--

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:01.360
some pity for a Socrates, who
actually took poison.

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:20.680
Not because Plato gave him one
that he couldn't do, for some

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:22.130
completely different reason.

00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:31.350
But this is the meaning of a
continuous function, and by

00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:36.880
getting that meaning which took
hundreds of years to see.

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:43.190
And it takes some time to get
these two different things, to

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:44.690
get the logic straight.

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:50.010
If x is close to a, then f
of x is close to f of a.

00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:57.640
That's what this means, f
of x approaching f of a.

00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:05.170
That's what Socrates and Plato
together had to explain.

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:08.410
OK, thank you.
