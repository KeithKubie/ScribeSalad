MIHAI IONESCU: Hello.

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.540
My name is Mihai Ionescu.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.470
And I'll give a quick
introduction to monetizing web

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.490
games and applications.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.910
Lately we have seen some
amazing growth in the

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.820
popularity of online games.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.560
And this is a great opportunity
for developers to

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.980
take advantage of
this strength.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.680
Notably, the fastest growing
segment using game

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.870
monetization is the freemium
model, where the game is free

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.190
but you charge for advanced
functionality.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.240
Such games are successful
because they are designed to

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.770
offer the users a simple, true
In-App experience and are

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.520
monetizing using
micro-payments.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.560
When considering the payments
API that meets those

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.380
characteristics, please
have a look at

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.120
Google In-App Payments.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.470
It comes with a lot
of benefits.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.950
First, for developers, the
pricing model is the most

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.690
aggressive in the industry,
5% flat fee.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.780
The API is very simple, with
minimal integration steps.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.310
And it also comes with full PCI
compliance, which means no

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.780
need to worry about complex
credit card regulations.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.370
Similarly, users get a true
In-App experience, which means

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.280
purchasing with just
a few clicks.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.790
Also, they get one payment
account to use across all

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.450
their games and applications
and private payment

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.650
credentials, which means no
need to worry about credit

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.600
card fraud or identity theft.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.340
As I said earlier, users
want simplicity.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.990
And with In-App Payments they
get simplicity when they make

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.030
a transaction, click,
pay, and use.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.770
Similarly, developers want
simplicity in implementation.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.640
With In-App Payments they get to
monetize in just two calls,

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.110
one API call to launch a
transaction and one API call

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.640
to collect.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.410
To summarize In-App Payments,
it's about

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.480
simplicity on all fronts.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.690
You don't need to worry about
risk management, compliance,

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:09.889
and analytics.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:12.340
It is all taken care of
by the Google payments

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.430
infrastructure.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.690
You also don't need to
worry about access to

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.550
a large user base.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.920
With In-App Payments you have
access to a lot of users from

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.590
different Google properties such
as the Chrome Web Store

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.840
or Google+.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.600
For developers the API is very
simple, one call to pay, one

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.480
call to collect.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.670
And last but not least, users
get to make a purchase with

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:41.920
minimal steps.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.070

sandbox environment where you

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.040
can test the integration of your
app, tools, libraries,

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.340
case studies, and more.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.590
