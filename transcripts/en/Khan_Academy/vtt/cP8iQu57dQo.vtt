00:00:00.475 --> 00:00:03.156
- [Voiceover] Let's explore the Fluid Mosaic Model

00:00:03.156 --> 00:00:05.960
of cell membranes.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.764
Now, why is it called the Fluid Mosaic Model?

00:00:08.764 --> 00:00:11.006
Well, if we were to look at a cell membrane

00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:12.570
and just to be clear what we're looking at,

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.247
if this is a cell right over here,

00:00:16.247 --> 00:00:18.936
and this is its membrane,

00:00:18.936 --> 00:00:21.662
it's kind of what keeps the cell, the inside of the cell,

00:00:21.662 --> 00:00:24.047
separated from whatever is outside the cell.

00:00:24.047 --> 00:00:29.050
We're looking at a cross-section of its surface,

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.170
Where down here, this is inside the cell.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.236
If we look at it relative to this diagram,

00:00:35.236 --> 00:00:39.496
this is inside the cell, and this is outside.

00:00:39.496 --> 00:00:42.470
And when you zoom in,

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.485
and this little part right over here,

00:00:44.485 --> 00:00:49.337
this is actually a phospholipid bilayer that forms it.

00:00:49.677 --> 00:00:50.964
And so when you hear that you might say,

00:00:50.964 --> 00:00:53.216
well, what is a phospholipid?

00:00:53.216 --> 00:00:54.290
And that's a good question.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.837
Because when you understand what a phospholipid is,

00:00:56.837 --> 00:00:58.980
it starts to make sense why it would form

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.327
a bilayer like this, and why it's the basis

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:04.140
for so many membranes in biological systems.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.271
So this is indicative of a phospholipid

00:01:07.271 --> 00:01:10.144
and as its name implies, and let me write that down,

00:01:10.144 --> 00:01:14.955
this is a phospholipid.

00:01:14.955 --> 00:01:17.852
It's a lipid that involves a phosphate group.

00:01:17.852 --> 00:01:19.116
And in general the word lipid,

00:01:19.116 --> 00:01:20.683
and we have a whole video on lipids,

00:01:20.683 --> 00:01:25.588
means something that doesn't dissolve so well in water.

00:01:25.588 --> 00:01:27.899
And that's true, as the case of this phospholipid,

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:30.278
you have these hydrocarbon tails

00:01:30.278 --> 00:01:32.218
that are coming from fatty acids,

00:01:32.218 --> 00:01:34.595
and so these hydrocarbon tails,

00:01:34.595 --> 00:01:37.470
they have no obvious charge or no obvious polarity.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.702
We know that water's a polar molecule

00:01:39.702 --> 00:01:41.547
that's what gives it its hydrogen bonds,

00:01:41.547 --> 00:01:43.537
and it's attracted to itself.

00:01:43.537 --> 00:01:45.649
But these don't have those, and so

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.509
they're not going to be attracted to the water

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.630
and the water's not going to be attracted to it, to them,

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.632
and so these tails are hydrophobic.

00:01:52.632 --> 00:01:57.638
So you have hydrophobic tails,

00:01:58.938 --> 00:01:59.943
and these are really kind of

00:01:59.943 --> 00:02:02.651
the lipid part of the phospholipids.

00:02:02.651 --> 00:02:07.646
And then you have the phosphate head

00:02:08.486 --> 00:02:10.556
right over here,

00:02:10.556 --> 00:02:13.537
and as you can clearly see, this has some charge.

00:02:13.537 --> 00:02:18.388
Charged molecules do well in polar substances like water.

00:02:18.388 --> 00:02:20.604
They're going to dissolve well, and so this part

00:02:20.604 --> 00:02:23.187
right over here, is going to be hydrophilic.

00:02:26.747 --> 00:02:29.921
And actually molecules that have a hydrophilic part

00:02:29.921 --> 00:02:31.274
and a hydrophobic part,

00:02:31.274 --> 00:02:33.317
there's a special word for them.

00:02:33.317 --> 00:02:37.863
Amphipathic, a word that I sometimes have trouble saying.

00:02:37.863 --> 00:02:41.509
So phospholipids are Amphipathic,

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:47.027
which means that they have both a hydrophilic end,

00:02:47.027 --> 00:02:48.310
a part that is attracted to water,

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.620
and a hydrophobic end, that is not attracted to water.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.382
And hopefully that starts to explain

00:02:53.382 --> 00:02:56.721
why they organize themselves in this way.

00:02:56.721 --> 00:02:57.969
Because you could image,

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:00.179
the hydrophilic heads are going to want to be

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:02.278
where the water is, which is going to be either

00:03:02.278 --> 00:03:04.581
outside the cell or inside the cells.

00:03:04.581 --> 00:03:07.325
And the tails are hydrophobic,

00:03:07.325 --> 00:03:08.484
the water's going to go away from them

00:03:08.484 --> 00:03:09.839
or they're going to go away from the water

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:11.382
and so they're just going to face each other

00:03:11.382 --> 00:03:14.607
and they're going to be on the inside of the membrane.

00:03:14.607 --> 00:03:16.644
But the really cool thing is, a structure like this,

00:03:16.644 --> 00:03:19.474
having this Amphipathic molecule,

00:03:19.474 --> 00:03:21.969
allows things like these bilipid,

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:25.925
these lipid bilayers, I should say, to form.

00:03:25.925 --> 00:03:27.195
And it's actually fascinating.

00:03:27.195 --> 00:03:29.942
You would think that if you go far back enough,

00:03:29.942 --> 00:03:33.486
even before life in cellular form, formed,

00:03:33.486 --> 00:03:36.794
that you might have had phospholipids spontaneously forming

00:03:36.794 --> 00:03:41.528
these spheres where you have a bilayer, a lipid bilayer.

00:03:41.528 --> 00:03:43.861
So you could imagine something, let me see,

00:03:43.861 --> 00:03:45.684
if I drew a cross-section,

00:03:45.684 --> 00:03:48.888
let me see if I can draw it relatively neatly.

00:03:48.888 --> 00:03:53.301
So, I think I'll draw half of it, just because you get,

00:03:53.301 --> 00:03:54.948
well I'll draw the whole thing

00:03:54.948 --> 00:03:56.481
and hopefully you get the idea.

00:03:56.481 --> 00:03:59.627
So that would be one layer

00:03:59.627 --> 00:04:02.704
of the phosphate heads facing the outside.

00:04:02.704 --> 00:04:04.896
This is the inner layer,

00:04:04.896 --> 00:04:07.164
and I'm doing a cross-section right over here.

00:04:07.164 --> 00:04:10.293
And then you have your hydrophobic tails,

00:04:11.773 --> 00:04:14.539
let me do that in a different color.

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:18.527
So your hydrophobic tails, I think you get the picture.

00:04:18.527 --> 00:04:22.152
We have a bunch of hydrophobic tails on either end

00:04:22.152 --> 00:04:24.486
and then you could spontaneously form a structure like this

00:04:24.486 --> 00:04:25.638
which starts to feel like, hey,

00:04:25.638 --> 00:04:27.453
well maybe there's a protocell forming.

00:04:27.453 --> 00:04:30.601
And obviously to actually have real life you have to have

00:04:30.601 --> 00:04:33.274
some form of information that can be passed on,

00:04:33.274 --> 00:04:35.057
and you have to have some type of metabolism,

00:04:35.057 --> 00:04:37.590
and the cell is living, and all of the definitions of life.

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.862
But at least this basic structure of the cellular membrane

00:04:39.862 --> 00:04:44.830
you could imagine how it forms in a pre-life state even,

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.344
by virtue of Amphipathic molecules like a phospholipid.

00:04:50.344 --> 00:04:51.238
So fair enough.

00:04:51.238 --> 00:04:54.354
We're able to form this phospholipid bilayer,

00:04:54.354 --> 00:04:57.187
but what are all these other things that I have drawn here?

00:04:57.187 --> 00:05:02.060
Well, these are proteins and these are examples of,

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.662
this is a protein right over here,

00:05:03.662 --> 00:05:05.954
this is a protein, this is a protein,

00:05:05.954 --> 00:05:08.451
and I just drew some blobs

00:05:08.451 --> 00:05:10.802
to be indicative of the variety of proteins.

00:05:10.802 --> 00:05:12.450
But the important thing to realize is,

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.469
if we think of cells, there's all of this diversity.

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:18.070
There's all of this complexity that is on,

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.031
or embedded, inside of its membrane.

00:05:20.031 --> 00:05:21.420
So instead of just thinking of it as just kind of

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.938
as a uniform phospholipid bilayer,

00:05:24.938 --> 00:05:28.044
there's all sorts of stuff,

00:05:28.044 --> 00:05:29.678
maybe if we view this as a cross-section,

00:05:29.678 --> 00:05:32.710
there's all sorts of stuff embedded in it

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.012
and we see it right over here in this diagram.

00:05:36.012 --> 00:05:38.582
You could say there's a mosaic of things embedded in it.

00:05:38.582 --> 00:05:41.405
A mosaic is a picture made up of a bunch of

00:05:41.405 --> 00:05:43.179
different components of all different colors,

00:05:43.179 --> 00:05:45.535
and you can see that you have all different components here,

00:05:45.535 --> 00:05:47.497
different types of proteins.

00:05:47.497 --> 00:05:50.747
You have proteins like this, that go across the membrane.

00:05:50.747 --> 00:05:53.057
We call these transmembrane proteins,

00:05:53.057 --> 00:05:55.194
they're a special class of integral protein.

00:05:55.194 --> 00:05:57.051
You have integral proteins like this,

00:05:57.051 --> 00:06:00.974
that might only interact with one part of the bilayer

00:06:00.974 --> 00:06:03.285
while these kind of go across it.

00:06:03.285 --> 00:06:06.159
You have things like glycolipids.

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:09.674
So this right over here, this is a glycolipid,

00:06:13.543 --> 00:06:14.599
which is fascinating.

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:16.363
It lodges itself in the membrane

00:06:16.363 --> 00:06:17.838
because it has this lipid end,

00:06:17.838 --> 00:06:19.381
so that's going to be hydrophobic.

00:06:19.381 --> 00:06:20.763
It's going to get along

00:06:20.763 --> 00:06:22.655
with all of the other hydrophobic things,

00:06:22.655 --> 00:06:28.088
but then it has an end that's really a chain of sugars

00:06:28.088 --> 00:06:29.760
and that part is going to be hydrophilic,

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.730
it's going to sit outside of the cell.

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:33.600
And these chains of sugars,

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.240
these are actually key for cell-cell recognition.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.687
Your immune system uses these to differentiate

00:06:38.687 --> 00:06:40.127
between which cells are the ones

00:06:40.127 --> 00:06:41.637
that are actually from my body,

00:06:41.637 --> 00:06:43.296
the ones I don't want to mess with,

00:06:43.296 --> 00:06:44.423
the ones I want to protect

00:06:44.423 --> 00:06:46.108
and which cells are the ones that are foreign,

00:06:46.108 --> 00:06:47.954
the ones that I might want to attack.

00:06:47.954 --> 00:06:49.524
When people talk about blood type,

00:06:49.524 --> 00:06:51.355
they're talking about, well, what type of

00:06:51.355 --> 00:06:55.531
specific glycolipids do you have on cells.

00:06:55.531 --> 00:06:58.761
And there's all sorts of, that's not all we're talking about

00:06:58.761 --> 00:07:02.495
when we talk about glycolipids as a way

00:07:02.495 --> 00:07:04.670
for cells to be recognized,

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:06.868
or to be tagged in different ways.

00:07:06.868 --> 00:07:10.417
So it's a fascinating thing that these chains of sugars

00:07:10.417 --> 00:07:12.762
can lead to such complex behavior, and frankly,

00:07:12.762 --> 00:07:15.492
such useful behavior, from our point of view.

00:07:15.492 --> 00:07:18.741
But you don't just want to have sugar chains on lipids,

00:07:18.741 --> 00:07:21.050
you also have sugar chains on proteins.

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.448
This, right over here, is an example of a glycoprotein.

00:07:27.998 --> 00:07:29.752
And as you can see, when you put all this stuff together,

00:07:29.752 --> 00:07:31.568
you get a mosaic, and I'm actually not even done.

00:07:31.568 --> 00:07:33.473
You have things like cholesterol embedded.

00:07:33.473 --> 00:07:35.483
Cholesterol is a lipid, so it's going to sit in the

00:07:35.483 --> 00:07:37.302
hydrophobic part of the membrane

00:07:37.302 --> 00:07:40.344
and that actually helps with the fluidity of the membrane,

00:07:40.344 --> 00:07:44.786
making sure it's not too fluid or not too stiff.

00:07:44.786 --> 00:07:49.003
So this is cholesterol, right over there.

00:07:49.003 --> 00:07:51.584
So you see this mosaic of stuff,

00:07:51.584 --> 00:07:53.282
but what about the fluid part?

00:07:53.282 --> 00:07:55.541
And I just talked about cholesterol's value

00:07:55.541 --> 00:07:58.269
in making sure that it's just the right amount of fluidity.

00:07:58.269 --> 00:08:01.262
What's neat about this, is this isn't a rigid structure.

00:08:01.262 --> 00:08:04.004
If this thing were to be jostled around a little bit

00:08:04.004 --> 00:08:06.048
or maybe it would be plucked-out somehow,

00:08:06.048 --> 00:08:09.010
the phospholipids would just spontaneously re-arrange

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:10.307
to fill in the gap.

00:08:10.307 --> 00:08:12.930
You could imagine these things are all flowing around.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:16.048
That this membrane actually has a consistency

00:08:16.048 --> 00:08:19.890
of oil or salad dressing.

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:24.098
So it isn't like a rubbery texture,

00:08:24.098 --> 00:08:26.958
like you might imagine, or a membrane, like a balloon.

00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:30.826
It's actually fluid. These things can move around,

00:08:30.826 --> 00:08:33.167
but even though it's fluid,

00:08:33.167 --> 00:08:35.897
it's good enough to separate the two environments.

00:08:35.897 --> 00:08:37.661
The environment inside the cell

00:08:37.661 --> 00:08:41.792
from the environment outside of the cell.

00:08:41.792 --> 00:08:45.689
And that's where the name Fluid Mosaic Model comes from.
