1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,410
Is there are alternatives that
are getting very big. Yes.

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:06,750
And and together like what?

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,620
Like signal has tens of millions of users.
I don't know what that is.

4
00:00:10,621 --> 00:00:13,770
It's never heard of it. That's like
the encrypted messaging app that,

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,470
do you know what? I don't,
it's open source. What is it?

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,570
Snowden is on there, but advisory
board or whatnot. What is signal?

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,650
It's just a messaging APP.

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:27,050
So a messenger like whatsapp or
like a Twitter or whatsapp. So it's,

9
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,040
you have to know the person and
then contact them through it. Yeah,

10
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,030
but we're talking,
we're,

11
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:34,900
we're considering using
the signal protocol for our
messaging system cause our

12
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:39,250
messaging system needs an upgrade.
But all of us together are going to be,

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,800
be able to create sort of like a,

14
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:47,130
a group of apps that are like sort of
a more open freedom supporting privacy

15
00:00:49,931 --> 00:00:53,830
alternative and like, so we're not
gonna solve it by ourselves. And

16
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:59,950
it would be way easier if one of these
big companies would just switch gears and

17
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:04,810
start doing things the right way. I mean,
we've spent eight years building this.

18
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,330
If one of the big companies,

19
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,720
Google Facebook had just
been free and open source,

20
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:15,970
we would have spent the last seven
years building on top of them. Right?

21
00:01:15,971 --> 00:01:18,790
Because you know they already did
something cool that they're sharing with

22
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:20,580
everybody.
So it's,

23
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,600
it's actually closed source project
stifle innovation because if you think we

24
00:01:25,661 --> 00:01:26,950
had to reinvent the wheel,
we literally,

25
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:30,040
we went and built in alternative with
much of the similar functionality.

26
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:31,330
Think about how,

27
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:36,310
how much further the world would be if
everyone was building on top of more

28
00:01:36,311 --> 00:01:38,040
common calls.

29
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:42,770
But you're looking at it in terms of your
own personal benefit you're looking at

30
00:01:42,771 --> 00:01:45,930
in terms of mine's personal benefit.
I mean, you created this thing,

31
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,680
it's not just pure for altruistic
reasons, it's a business, right?

32
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:54,710
So if they had established this open
source network that was Facebook and then

33
00:01:56,371 --> 00:01:59,220
you just came along and built yours, will
that, yeah, that would be great for you.

34
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,030
But why would that be great for them?
I mean they,

35
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,800
they're obviously in a business now
the problem with the businesses,

36
00:02:04,801 --> 00:02:07,320
this business is the business
of distributing information.

37
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,390
And then we have to decide,
okay,

38
00:02:09,391 --> 00:02:14,391
at what point in time do we allow these
air quotes overlords to dictate what can

39
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:18,990
and cannot be distributed? And how did
this happen? Because in the beginning,

40
00:02:18,991 --> 00:02:20,070
I bet it didn't happen.

41
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,880
I bet in the beginning you could just
put on whatever the fuck you wanted and

42
00:02:23,881 --> 00:02:26,130
then they had to deal with that and then
they had to figure out after a while,

43
00:02:26,131 --> 00:02:28,350
okay, maybe we shouldn't
have this on like, hey,

44
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,510
if we're going to sell advertising,

45
00:02:30,511 --> 00:02:33,840
we really should maximize the amount
of clicks. Okay, how do we do that?

46
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,180
While we put things in people's feeds,
they want to see,

47
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:39,870
we put things that people want to debate
about and argue about and political

48
00:02:39,871 --> 00:02:42,660
things and all sorts of different things
that excite them and get them to be

49
00:02:42,661 --> 00:02:46,800
engaged with the platform that's,
that's their business. The businesses,

50
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:52,310
I mean it's no different in a lot of ways
than Amazon or then any other business

51
00:02:52,621 --> 00:02:54,240
that wants to grow.
Like how do,

52
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:59,300
how do they grow while they grow by
maximizing their profits and by the amount

53
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:02,440
of eyes that get to their advertising.

54
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:04,930
So they get more clicks and
more people get engaged.

55
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,760
That's what their businesses,
you're deciding by saying
if they were open source,

56
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:12,850
look how much further on the world with
be. They would be further along to,

57
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,230
I don't know if they
would agree with that.

58
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,170
I don't think they're there worth
fucking cajillions of dollars.

59
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,490
So they figured it out.
Well,

60
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:23,470
it just depends on whether or not you
think that people have a right to know

61
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:28,120
what is going on. It's, I mean
it's like food transparency.
Well yeah, we were. Yeah.

62
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,740
So I'll talk about that.
I like,

63
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:34,780
I will talk about that until the end of
time you were interfacing with this and

64
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:39,220
it's affecting us. I agree. Yeah. I
fully agree with what you're saying.

65
00:03:39,221 --> 00:03:42,880
I'm playing devil's advocate by saying
that in their position they have a

66
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:47,350
business and their businesses to make
money and they're going to lose because of

67
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:52,330
what they're doing because it's not as
insistent up even at polar losing active

68
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:53,530
users, are they? Yeah,

69
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,980
but I've thought their business
went up after the hearings did it,

70
00:03:56,981 --> 00:03:59,020
but it's not going to last.
I mean, look, when I say that

71
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,990
it's just the game's over. It's gonna
take a long time for us to build it up.

72
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,740
As you know, all of these
different organizations and
companies working together.

73
00:04:08,741 --> 00:04:12,760
But
Linux for instance,

74
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,550
is the operating system that most banks,

75
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,930
it is the most popular operating system
in the world. It's, it's, it's, yeah,

76
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,180
it's open. It's in your
phone. It's in everywhere.

77
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,700
It got there because of that,

78
00:04:24,701 --> 00:04:28,660
because everyone used it and incorporate
it into their product. Facebook,

79
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:33,520
they are all using free and open
source software in their stacks.

80
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,980
They're just not sharing their
product with everybody else.

81
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:40,380
So they're benefiting from it but
not giving back. And you know, I,

82
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,560
I almost feel like I shouldn't even
be saying that they should just pivot

83
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:49,270
because you know,
that's their only chance to survive.

84
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:54,730
So this is based on your
estimations of the future. Yeah.

85
00:04:54,731 --> 00:04:59,731
It just seems like things are becoming
more open and if is that possible because

86
00:05:00,011 --> 00:05:04,150
you engage with a lot of other super
nerds and you guys all have these similar

87
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:07,150
ideas. You just have to look at
what's happening with bitcoin.

88
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,130
I don't know what's
happening with bitcoin.

89
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:14,170
It's become a bitcoin and ethereum and
you know, lots of other blockchains are,

90
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,160
are, are growing really fast. Maybe
the, you know, the price is separate,

91
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,410
the development energy,

92
00:05:20,411 --> 00:05:24,220
the number of people who are building
apps on top of bitcoin and ethereum is

93
00:05:24,221 --> 00:05:26,140
growing massively. There's, there's,

94
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:31,230
it's a whole new infrastructure that's
like a common protocol that people can

95
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:36,370
build on. So that is growing
rapidly. The price is secondary.

96
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,900
That's not even what bitcoin and
ethereum are really about. It's,

97
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,450
it's a decentralized database.

98
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:48,640
So this is just where the Internet,
the Internet is meant to be decentralized.

99
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:50,020
It sort of started out that way.

100
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:55,140
And then we moved into this like web to
silo system with like just these massive

101
00:05:56,051 --> 00:06:00,170
companies that are controlling everything.
But it's gonna, it's gonna keep waving.

102
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,570
Okay. Again, to play devil's advocate,

103
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,690
the vast amount of users are
not using those platforms.

104
00:06:05,691 --> 00:06:09,680
The vast amount of users are using these
controlled platforms like Facebook and

105
00:06:09,681 --> 00:06:13,700
Instagram and Twitter. Like if that's,
if you're, if you're talking about,

106
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:16,170
I'm just guessing, but if
you're talking about the, the,

107
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,300
the gross number of human beings that
are interacting with each other on social

108
00:06:20,301 --> 00:06:23,540
media,
they're mostly uncontrolled networks.

109
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,910
You're saying that this is not gonna last,

110
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:30,140
but there's no evidence that it isn't
going to last. There's tons of evidence.

111
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:34,100
What is the evidence? Wikipedia,
what is happening in card?

112
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:37,340
I remember that desk you put in your
computer, that was your encyclopedia.

113
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,830
Where is that? No one uses it.
Okay. That's, that's different.

114
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,690
This is not a social media network.

115
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,400
The social media networks that people are
using are almost all controlled, right?

116
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:53,480
Yeah. No I it's not, it's going to
take a very, very long time. How long?

117
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,070
I would say 10 years.

118
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,560
And what do you think is
going to be the catalyst?

119
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:03,890
Like what's going to cause these people
to make this radical shift to open

120
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:06,200
source?
I think we have to be,

121
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:09,970
we have responsibility to be
competitive functionally. Like you know,

122
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:13,310
science does. We were saying we do, we're
getting, we're moving there fast. Like,

123
00:07:13,311 --> 00:07:17,810
we just hired a ton of new developers
and it's going to take time.

124
00:07:17,811 --> 00:07:19,130
We're not there yet.
Right.

125
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,160
But once we have functionally competitive
products that you wouldn't even know

126
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:27,200
the difference and there's
enough people there,

127
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:30,770
then it's basically the
decision of, uh, you know,

128
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,460
am I going to choose the one that respects
my privacy and freedom or are the one

129
00:07:34,461 --> 00:07:38,960
that doesn't? And people are all
kids don't like Facebook, right?

130
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,640
No. Everyone is sick of it.
We're just drug addicts. Hmm.

131
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:49,290
Um, is that what it is? They're just
sucked into this thing where you,

132
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:52,970
you constantly want to check and
see who's writing what and yeah,

133
00:07:52,971 --> 00:07:57,080
and there's monopolies,
arguably. Yeah. Yeah. Right.

134
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,810
Especially when Facebook
owns Instagram. Right. Um,

135
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,810
what if they bought Twitter as well?
They almost did,

136
00:08:02,811 --> 00:08:07,250
I think Google almost into two steps in
and buys everything. Then you're like,

137
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,960
oh no, they probably could.
Right? Yeah, they easily could.

138
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:16,340
They could probably buy everything
apple could with cash. Yeah. Yeah.

139
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,650
Tim Cook had come in with
a big purple pimp suit on,

140
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:23,440
just slap down a briefcase patch.
I just wonder and like look all the,

141
00:08:23,441 --> 00:08:26,120
all of these executives,
you know,

142
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,990
Jack seems like a cool person.
She's a very nice guy. It's not,

143
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:34,610
I just sent so much
inconsistency and you know,

144
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,890
he's talking about Bitcoin,

145
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,350
like it's this important new internet
money simultaneous, which is,

146
00:08:42,351 --> 00:08:45,470
he knows the infrastructure is open,

147
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:49,490
but then his platforms or the opposite,

148
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,480
why is he selling consistent?
It's like there's,

149
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,920
it's just hypocritical to the maximum.

150
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,910
I think it's partly because
it's a giant business, you know?

151
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:04,050
And I think when you have an obligation
to your shareholders and to maximize

152
00:09:04,051 --> 00:09:06,690
profits and when you're trying
to maximize profits too,

153
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:10,320
and there's this universal growth model
where every year just has to get a

154
00:09:10,321 --> 00:09:12,660
little bit bigger.
Otherwise you're fucking up as a CEO.

155
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,620
Like you don't have to
experience that with mines.

156
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,840
You were one of the cofounders.
How many people are involved?

157
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,420
Just like 15 of us now.

158
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:26,040
And do you have like a board we sit around
when you make critical decisions such

159
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,310
stressful as fuck.
Yeah.

160
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,870
Luckily we've started off from the
point where we're saying, okay,

161
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:34,140
we're embedding principles
into how we're doing things.

162
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,680
So we're not in a position
where we would ever change that,

163
00:09:39,691 --> 00:09:42,480
that that's for us to do.

164
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:46,080
That would just be a total waste of time,
right?

165
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:51,120
So we're making it harder for ourselves
to make money in the beginning.

166
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,720
We're making it harder for ourselves to
grow because we are not gonna compromise

167
00:09:56,761 --> 00:09:58,920
people's privacy in
order to do those things.

168
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,830
And so we're just going
to build up slowly,

169
00:10:01,831 --> 00:10:05,040
steadily find and just get
there when we get there.
