00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.490
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Hello, I'm Stephen Winick.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.130
I'm the writer and editor in
the American Folklife Center

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.680
at the Library of Congress,
and I'm here with Jeff

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.070
and Gerret Warner, who are
going to be talking to us

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.510
about their careers
and about the Frank

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.460
and Anne Warner collection,
or, as we sometimes call it,

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.710
the Anne and Frank Warner
collection, which is one

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.110
of our treasured
collections here

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.890
at the American Folklife Center.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.400
And, it's a -- it's a large
multiformat collection,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.710
mostly sound recordings
of traditional folk music.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.410
So, Jeff and Gerret, thank
you for being with us.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.710
&gt;&gt; It's a treat.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.010
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
It's a real treat.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.310
Thank you.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.610
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And
I guess we'll just start

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.910
by talking a little
bit about your parents

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.570
and what they accomplished,
and what it was that they did.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.080
So, let's talk a
little about starting

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.590
with Frank Warner's
background a little bit.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:04.890
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Shall I?

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.190
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Uh-huh.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.490
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
I get to speak?

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.790
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Uh-huh.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.420
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Well, Frank
Warner was born in Selma,

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.250
Alabama 1903, and grew up on
an unusual street for Selma.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.330
Sylvan [assumed spelling]
Street was black and white,

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.930
and his next-door
neighbor was black,

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.440
and he attributed quite a bit of
his affinity for black culture

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.880
and black music to
the those first years.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.750
And then they moved to
Tennessee and landed in Durham,

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.330
North Carolina, where he
did most of his growing up.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.470
Went to Duke University,
where we went.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.330
And, was a singer from
the very beginning.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.410
Did singing on radio and
sang in gospel -- glee clubs.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.110
And, yeah.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.410
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.030
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: He was
a performer early on.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.490
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And he went
to Duke, and one of the things

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.870
that he studied was folklore and
folk music there, is that right?

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.170
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Yes.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.470
[ Making Sound with Mouth ]

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.770
Well, not really.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.070
Well, he --

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.710
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: No, because
Dr. Frank C. Brown was there --

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.010
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:09.310
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Teaching
literature

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.280
and had a course on the ballad.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.650
And father, who ran the glee
club and toured the state,

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.450
sort of prominent on campus.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.610
So, Dr. Brown asked
him if he would come in

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.330
and demonstrate some of the
songs that he, Frank Brown,

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.160
had collected in the mountains
and on the Outer Banks.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.150
And, so, my father learned some
songs and came in and did that.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.450
I'm not sure he --

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.750
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: So, we figured
that would've been the beginning

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.380
of sense of folklore really,

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.250
rather than just these
are songs that I like.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.550
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: I think so.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:38.870
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah, and,
of course, Frank C. Brown was

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.040
such an important
figure at Duke,

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.220
but throughout North
Carolina and, ultimately,

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.990
in the national folklore world,
that just having known him

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.730
and work with him
would have affected --

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.030
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: I think so.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.330
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Frank, yeah.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.970
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: I was just
listening to family interviews

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.710
that we did back in
the early 1970's.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.230
And, I had forgotten,
my father played

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.990
in what he called an orchestra
at Duke, played the trombone,

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.670
but he didn't read music.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.320
And, so, he said he did like
a base part on the trombone,

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.460
and that's the way he
knew music, by ear.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.690
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: He could
sort of figure out the part --

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.080
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Yeah, so, he
did that for Professor Brown.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.380
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Great.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.660
And, let's talk a little bit
about Anne Warner's background.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.420
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Yeah, she was
born in St. Louis in 1905,

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.810
and then -- to an
upper-middle-class family.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.680
They lived in St.
Paul and then Chicago.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.320
She went to Northwestern,
but then there was a turn

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.040
in family fortunes, so she had
to leave Northwestern at the end

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.570
of her sophomore year
to go to New York,

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.510
where my grandparents were
at the time, to help raise --

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.700
keep the family together
and keep it going.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.370
And, she had a whole
bunch of jobs,

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.050
saddened that she
couldn't get her degree.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.180
But, what it did was send
her onto a secretarial path,

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.080
which was good for the folklore
collection because she was able

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.630
to take all singers
words down in shorthand.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.120
So, our texts are peerless.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.420
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: That's great.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.720
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Really true.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.510
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
And, how did they meet?

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.810
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: They
met through --

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:18.610
my father was running YMCA
camps in Greensboro in the '20s,

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.350
late '20s, and he took a job.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.800
He was always a YMCA
professional.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.180
He took a job in New York City.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.740
I don't think it was yet
with the Grand Central YMCA,

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.870
but eventually he became
a railroad YMCA person.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.930
And, it was through a Greensboro
benefactor of the Y down there

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.980
that -- who established
a coterie

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.090
of young people in
New York City.

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.310
Somehow, they got
into that atmosphere.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.890
They met there.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.190
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And
New York City seems

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.140
to have been important to the
early sort of establishment

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.490
of -- there's sort of an
intellectual environment there.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.970
So, in you -- in the book your
mother mentions Carl Sandburg

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.180
and Carl Carmer and
people that they met there.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.480
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: We think --

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.780
yeah, we think it was
an important moment.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.110
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: I think
it made all the difference

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.410
in the world.

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.760
That's how they actually ended
up on Beech Mountain in 1938.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.310
And, but it gave them
different eyes and ears

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.880
than they might have
had otherwise, I think.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.180
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So, who
were some of the people?

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.480
I mean, I mentioned
the two Carls,

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.780
but who else were around there?

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.670
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Carl
Carmer lived upstairs

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.480
and was doing a series of
books on America's rivers.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.780
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.080
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: He had written
a book called Stars Fell

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.470
on Alabama in the '20s, I
think, which we used folklore --

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:32.770
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.670
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: In
describing the life and times

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.630
of Alabama and people.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.830
And, in doing a book
on the Hudson River,

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.030
he came across a
couple of people

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.290
who became major informants
of my parents, John Galusha

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:48.020
and the Adirondacks
and Lena Bourne Fish

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.250
in Jaffrey, New Hampshire.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.550
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: All right.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.600
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Yeah,
and William Rose Benet,

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.720
his brother Stephen Vincent
Benet, were close neighbors

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.030
and friends, and Marjorie
Flack, who was married to one

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.470
of the Benets, she did
children's book illustrations.

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.150
We remember her from
our childhood.

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.820
It was just an atmosphere
around.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.930
And, Maurice Matteson, who
came to visit them in '37

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.990
at their house and
brought a mountain dulcimer

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.920
that started them on their trek.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.400
I mean, that whole
idea of a mountain --

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.350
a guy who collected songs in
western North Carolina coming

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.930
to Greenwich Village with his
dulcimer to show people --

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.520
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And
that's what did it for them?

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.820
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: And
that's what did it.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.120
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.420
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Yeah,
magic moment, bong.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:36.720
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
So, they decided to go

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.600
and actually do collecting
themselves, is that --

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.900
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Well --

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.200
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: That's a --

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.500
yeah, we think of it
as a magic moment.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.960
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: It is a magic
moment, I'm quite sure it is,

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.210
in the sense that they
went down to get a dulcimer

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.920
like Maurice Matteson
had and, in the process,

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.960
they discovered this banjo also
that Nathan Hicks could make

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.260
and they asked for one.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.530
And then, they went back
and they got the banjo

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:04.100
that we'll be talking about.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.690
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah, we'll
talk about that in a little bit.

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.250
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: And, but
what really strikes me,

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:09.840
maybe I'm jumping the
gun a little bit here,

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.700
but is what mom said was that
on that first day of collecting

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.320
on Beech Mountain
they recognized

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.750
that this was something that
might change their lives.

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:21.680
And I think, how
dramatic that must've been

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.170
that she recognized it.

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:26.480
I think she was primed to
look for it, they were.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.980
But, it's interesting to think,
because most of us don't know

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:34.020
when a life's work
is going to begin.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.320
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.620
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: We just sort
of recognize it after a while.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:37.920
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: After a while.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.340
But, well, going back to that

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.730
that moment they
saw the dulcimer.

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:43.210
They wrote to Nathan
Hicks to get one.

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.040
He said he'd make one for them.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.410
The moment they sat in the
living room on West 11th --

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:51.070
West 10th Street in Greenwich
Village and said, you know,

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.000
instead of waiting
for this in the mail,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.170
why don't we borrow a
car and drive 800 miles

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:57.890
on little roads to get this.

00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:59.190
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Yeah.

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:00.490
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:01.790
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: That's
a magic moment.

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:03.090
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: That's
a magic moment, sure.

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:04.390
Yeah. So, one of the
things that's interesting

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:07.620
about the collection is that,
you know, some great folklores

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:11.000
that we have in our collections
weren't that good technically

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.150
and the sound ends up
not being that good,

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:16.740
because it's an early
technology,

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:19.090
but your parents actually
did a pretty good job

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:20.490
of capturing sound.

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:21.790
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
I don't know how.

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:23.090
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: What
-- how did they learn?

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:24.390
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
I don't know how.

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:27.140
I mean, I've said to Jeff many
times, because I'm a filmmaker,

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.980
I can't believe that
they never had a set

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:31.140
of headphones, for instance.

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:32.440
They could never monitor.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.740
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
That's weird, yeah.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.040
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: So,
they could play it back,

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:36.860
but it's not quite
the same thing.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.470
So, you do hear kids in the
background and all of that.

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:40.770
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Sure.

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:42.070
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: But,
that's part of the charm

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:43.370
with the recording, but --

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:44.670
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: And our
father singing harmony.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:46.440
He'd collect singers,
traditional singers,

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.010
and then he'd join in
[laughter], which is part of --

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:49.310
[ Inaudible ]

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:52.600
Part of the joy of the party
and part of the way he,

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.740
as somebody said, he
collected people, not songs,

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:57.040
and a part of the way

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.740
of collecting was making
it a moment for everybody.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.400
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: But,
it wasn't folklore 101.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.170
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: No, it's not
[inaudible] never taught that.

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:04.470
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Yeah.

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:05.770
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Right.

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:07.070
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: But, you
know, in those earliest days,

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:09.350
as mom describes, you
know, was this disc

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:12.280
and the acetate would
collect as it caught the disc,

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.830
and you'd have to brush it away

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:16.830
and sometimes you
didn't and all of that.

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:18.280
I don't really know
how they did it.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:21.080
They also didn't have
any financial backing so.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.380
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Well, that --

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.680
yeah, that was another
interesting question.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.240
I mean, so you had
people like the Lomaxes,

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:29.770
and you had people working
the various WPA projects

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:31.470
around the states,
and they were --

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:34.250
it was clear how they
were doing it financially,

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:35.580
where it was coming from.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.640
But, your parents would just
go out on their vacations.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.030
They would take all their
vacation time to do this.

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:44.480
That kind of made their project
a little bit different --

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.780
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: I think so.

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.080
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Than someone else's.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.380
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Yeah,

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:49.680
I'm surprised they had
a month, first of all.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.050
My mom was a secretary
and pop was working

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:52.800
for the YMCA, but
they had a month.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.930
And, the way they described it
was, two weeks in the south,

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:59.060
two weeks in the north.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.430
But, it doesn't explain
how they bought the discs

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:03.710
and any of those supplies.

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:07.970
I mean, it just -- that
really surprises me.

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:11.900
But, it's the donation of
those early recording machines,

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:15.230
disc recorders, that really
did make the difference,

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:19.300
as Lomax pointed out, because
he was early on recording.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.700
The recognition, that
recording was so important

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.630
to get the song, the
whole song when you could.

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:26.080
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So,
how did they get their

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.140
recording machines?

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:31.160
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: I can't remember
how Ferrara Reinhardt [assumed

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.670
spelling], the first one that
they got, the first disc cutter

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:36.360
in 1940, how -- what
that connection was.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.660
I know that --

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:38.960
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
They were friends.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.260
One of them was a friend.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:41.560
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: It was a friend?

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.860
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Yeah.

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.160
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Then they
took that the first year.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.460
But, you had to go to someplace

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:46.760
where there was electricity
and plug it in.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.060
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Sure, yeah.

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:49.360
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Where they were
collecting there wasn't any.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.660
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:51.960
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Which is
another interesting thing

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.260
about acquisition.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:54.560
You know, that these people
left their home and went

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.860
down off the mountain to
somebody else's house.

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.160
They're sitting in a
strange living room

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.460
and recording their song.

00:10:58.460 --> 00:10:59.760
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Or,
a general store.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.080
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Whereas later
it was a battery driven Filco.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.130
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Frank Warner
did an experimental TV show

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:09.290
in Philadelphia in 1940,
and Filco got interested.

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:12.320
They were doing -- connected
somehow to the filming of it,

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.300
and they got interested
in what he was doing

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.090
and they developed this
portable, with a wind up,

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:20.300
so you didn't have to
plug it in, disc cutter.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.980
That's how the 41 machine
happened, and that was used

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:25.280
for a couple of years.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.950
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: it still
was snippets of song,

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:30.020
so it wasn't all the variations

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:32.090
that they later could
get on tape.

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:33.390
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah,
and then, ultimately,

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:36.150
there was a battery-operated
machine as well.

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:37.450
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: No, I
think that was the battery.

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:38.750
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Oh, I see.

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:40.050
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: I think
it was wind up battery.

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:41.350
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Inside the --

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:42.650
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: I see.

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:43.950
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: As far
as I could understand.

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:45.250
I don't know.

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:46.550
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:47.850
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: We mourn --

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:49.150
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
We don't have it.

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:50.450
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: We mourn it.

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:51.750
We went -- we look at
each other and say,

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:53.050
what did they do with it?

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:54.350
And, we have the expectation
that the day they got reel

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:55.650
to reel, that thing went
out the second story window.

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:56.950
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
yeah, yeah, maybe so.

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.250
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: I still
remember that Wallensock Satin

00:11:58.250 --> 00:11:59.610
at the corner of
our living room.

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:00.910
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: The
reel to reel.

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:02.210
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: You know,

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:05.700
it had kind of like an
early CBS logo, these two --

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.460
you probably know this machine.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.610
The two eyes would come
together as a video meter.

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:10.910
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right, right.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:12.210
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: You
know, and if they --

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:13.570
if they clashed you
were over modulating.

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:14.870
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: I forgot that.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:16.170
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: That
was it [laughter].

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:17.470
No monitoring.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:18.770
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Very cool.

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:20.070
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
But, they sound good.

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:21.370
They sound really good.

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:22.670
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:23.970
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
Especially, you know, 1950 on.

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:25.270
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:26.570
So, you had mentioned that
your mother was really good

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:29.140
at shorthand, and
that kind of gets us

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:32.320
into another question just in
general of the different roles

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:36.180
that your parents played in the
collection process, because we,

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:38.580
Jeff and I chatted about this
little on the phone once,

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:41.660
that their -- that they each
brought their own magic to it.

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:44.960
Tell me about that a little bit.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.400
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Well, I mean,

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.940
it was a pretty complementary
set of skills

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:52.270
that the two came together with,

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:55.970
didn't know how much it would
help them in this collection.

00:12:55.970 --> 00:13:01.970
But, mom was a born
fact checker, historian.

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:05.460
I think probably felt
a great deal of romance

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:10.470
about this literary
musical event

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:12.430
that they were getting into.

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:16.240
And, she brings all of
that to her good writing.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:20.910
And, pop was a natural
performer,

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:23.470
somewhat dramatic in
the way he did it.

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:26.060
If I can do an aside here for
a moment, I want to be sure

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:28.440
to talk about just
his performing,

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.440
because I think it
was very unusual.

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:34.800
He -- and Jeff does
it now, as well.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.070
But, Frank Warner would
take a picture say

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:40.290
of Yankee John Galusha and
put it on an easel beside him,

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:46.570
and then he would conjure up his
memory of this person wholly.

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:47.870
This is the person.

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:51.510
And he would say, I'm here to
represent Yankee John Galusha,

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:55.100
not I'm Frank Warner,
going to sing you a song.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.080
It's a pretty unusual notion.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.350
It took all of the
pressure off him in a way,

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:01.780
maybe why he just
loved performing,

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:03.440
and he did that with
each of these people.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:04.740
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:06.040
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: So --

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.340
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: That is --

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:08.640
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: He was
-- he was a storyteller.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:09.940
He was not a fact checker.

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:12.290
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: And, the fact
that he came out of the south

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:14.980
and was working with
working people all his life,

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:17.790
and then a YMCA director dealing

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:20.030
with upper-class
people on his boards --

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:21.330
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Yeah.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:22.630
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: I think
helped them so much to go back

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:24.630
and forth and know how to
handle a room and how to be --

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:26.330
work with people of any stripe.

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:27.630
So --

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:28.930
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Kind
of a social worker --

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:30.230
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Yeah.

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:31.530
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
The way he had --

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:32.830
I mean, in a sense that was
his work with young people,

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:34.130
and I think it helped
him in collecting.

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:36.190
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: So, his charm
and ability to communicate,

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:38.900
linked our mother's
historian point of view

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.550
and editing abilities --

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:41.850
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
And that ended --

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:44.920
that ended up creating a
collection that both sort

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:48.940
of represents the fun that
they were having and doing it,

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:53.560
but also has the names of the
singers and dates and things

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.150
that are important to remember

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:57.610
about each event,
each recording event.

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:00.880
So, it's a -- it was a
good partnership certainly.

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.100
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: in the -- in
the many concerts that we sat

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:06.480
in the audience and listened to
Frank Warner, it is very common

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:10.020
for him to, you know,
be completely engrossed

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:12.580
in the story that he was selling
and then forget some fact,

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:15.060
and mom would call it
out from the audience.

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:16.360
That was the concert.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.660
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:18.960
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: And
that was a standard thing,

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.260
and they worked that
out pretty well.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:21.560
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Very good.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.700
So, eventually they started

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.800
to bring you guys
along on these trips.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.860
That started pretty early,
didn't it, in your lives?

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:35.880
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Yeah, we
were, golly, three and six.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.180
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Six and nine.

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:39.100
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Three -- no, it
was '43 when they went to see --

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:41.190
'46 when they went
to see John Galusha.

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:42.490
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Okay.

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:43.790
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: You were a baby.

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:45.090
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: I
don't remember that.

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:46.390
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: No, you were a
babe in arms and I was three.

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:47.690
I just know that
because we have a picture

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:48.990
of me sitting next
to John Galusha.

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:50.290
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah, right.

00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:53.720
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: The Yankee
logger singer and, with his dog,

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:57.330
Flash, that I was much more
interested in than the songs.

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:58.980
And, so, that's when it started.

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:02.210
I was just -- the
war had stopped,

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:04.260
or was about to stop,
everything.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.150
Yes, they sold their car.

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:10.130
We just remember they sold
their first car in '43.

00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:13.040
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: A car
we didn't know they had.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.350
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: We
didn't know they had.

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:16.550
We were in it, we
didn't know they had it.

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:21.830
So, yeah, and then
-- but, in '40 --

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:25.800
in '51 was the first
time we remember anything

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.270
about being on a trip with them.

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:28.570
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Yes.

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:29.870
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:31.170
And what was that like?

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:32.470
Did you -- did you kind

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:33.770
of recognize how
extraordinary it was?

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:35.070
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Oh, no.

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:36.370
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Or,
was it just mom and dad?

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:37.670
Yeah.

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:38.970
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Absolutely,
mom and dad.

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:40.270
You know, and the hardships
of living on a mountain home.

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:41.570
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
Yeah, and shooting guns

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:42.870
with Frank Proffitt, Junior.

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:44.170
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Well,
that was nice.

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:45.470
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
That kind of thing.

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:46.770
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Climbing the
hills with the Proffitt kids.

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:48.070
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
Well, we did notice,

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:49.370
I talked about this
before, was how different

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:50.670
of the social exchange
was on Beech Mountain

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:54.160
than we had known, say at folk
parties in Greenwich Village,

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.970
was that people might sit for
a long time without talking

00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:59.310
and they were all
comfortable in that silence.

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:02.520
That was a new experience
for me, I've never forgotten.

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:03.820
But, very kind.

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:05.560
It wasn't -- it wasn't
an awkward silence,

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.330
is I guess what I'm
trying to say.

00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:08.630
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Yeah.

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:10.240
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: And the people
were so utterly welcoming,

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:14.930
very thankful that we'd --
that mom and pop had come back,

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:16.230
which they talked about.

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:18.830
I didn't think we'd
ever see you again,

00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:20.600
because they didn't
see many people.

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.900
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:24.890
Yeah. And I guess, you know,
your parents had been there

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:28.010
and gotten something from them,
collected something from them,

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:30.020
and they, you know, they
had that feeling that, well,

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.770
maybe that's all
they were after.

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:33.070
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Yeah.

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:34.370
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:35.670
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
Which is always a risk.

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:36.970
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
But, it's not.

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:38.270
Yeah, always a risk, exactly.

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:39.570
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: And we were so
glad that we went back in '59,

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:40.870
because we were then teenagers.

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:42.170
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
Yeah, that's memorable.

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:43.470
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: And
that was memorable.

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:44.770
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:46.070
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: And
Frank Proffitt,

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:47.370
who they had not seen -- and
they had seen him in the '30s

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:50.240
and '40s, but not in
1951 when they went back.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.100
He was out working.

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:56.290
But now, he was there,
'59, and they had tape deck

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:58.680
and it was just, that was great.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:17:59.980
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:01.280
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: I
mean, we were close

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.170
with the kids and
it was memorable.

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:04.470
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And they
got some great recordings

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:05.770
out of that as well.

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:07.070
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Yeah.

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:09.240
But, it's hard to -- it's
hard to imagine actually.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.860
Frank Proffitt walked
eight miles to get

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:13.160
to that first meeting.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.460
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Wow.

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:15.760
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: And then
walked eight miles home.

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.060
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:18.360
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: And that
was mountain life then.

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.660
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
It was normal, yeah.

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:20.960
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
Nobody had cars.

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:22.260
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:23.900
Amazing. So, I wanted to
ask you guys about some

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:26.980
of your impressions of the
rural people that you met,

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.700
specifically some of the folks
that your mother wrote about.

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:32.030
Now, I know you were very young
when you met some of them,

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:35.420
so you might not have that
many memories, but let's start

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:38.900
with John Galusha, that
you mentioned, Jeff.

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:40.200
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: I
was just thinking,

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.500
you don't have any
memory of him.

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:42.800
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: I
don't have any memory.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.100
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: No, no.

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:45.400
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Except pop
as a Yankee John Galusha.

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.700
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: That's right.

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:49.630
We have this overlay of the many
talks of our parents about them.

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:53.640
I just remember meeting him
when I was six or seven,

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.820
or something, and he
was on his deathbed.

00:18:55.820 --> 00:19:00.420
That's the only really
full memory I have of him.

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:03.160
And, yet, I would say
now, of all the singers

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:04.930
that my parents worked with,

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:08.940
he's the one whose style
I follow the closest.

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.240
He had --

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.540
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
Such great songs.

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:12.840
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Such
a great song,

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.890
and really historical old songs.

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:21.330
I was talking with a friend of
mine in Sussex, and I played him

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:24.890
in England and I played him
a CD of John Galusha singing.

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:27.420
And, he went right to his
library, pulled out a CD,

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:30.640
and put it on, and it was
a northern Irish singer.

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:35.810
It was that same style, not
the curly cue kind of singing

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:40.800
of western Irish, southern
Irish, but just storytelling.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:46.860
And, I see that as a logging
camp style of singing,

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:48.650
of just telling the story.

00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:49.950
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And it may --

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:51.410
that may reflect the
fact that you've lived

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:53.010
in New Hampshire
for quite a while.

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:54.310
[ Inaudible ]

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:56.670
But, you're -- but, you're
not a southerner also,

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:59.440
which may be why he's the
one that you gravitated --

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.740
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Yes.

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:02.040
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Toward more.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.340
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Could be.

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:04.640
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah, so.

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:05.940
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Could be.

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:07.240
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: I also --

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:08.540
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
Memories of people, I mean,

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:09.840
there are two people that are
particularly memorable to me.

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.810
One of them was Buna Hicks, Buna
Vista Hicks, who played fiddle,

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:16.760
you know, in the crook of
her arm, the dugout fiddle.

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:18.680
But, she had a very sweet voice

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:21.230
that just projected
a great distance,

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:23.570
and she was just
sweet as could be.

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:26.380
Just took care of the kids
and brought us all in.

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:28.780
The other was, and most
notably, Frank Proffitt.

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:33.690
He had an effect on everybody
who met him, just as --

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:39.840
both a funny man and a
very serious poet, farmer.

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.950
So, yeah, he was --
he was something,

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:43.480
and we got to know
him very well.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:44.780
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:47.310
Well, I want to talk a little
bit more about him later,

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:51.390
but I should also mention
that we have a banjo

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:54.400
that Frank made, and we're --

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.700
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: That's great.

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.160
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Very
glad to be getting a banjo

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.460
from you today, which we'll talk

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.390
about a little bit
in a moment as well.

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:04.120
But, other people that I
wanted to mention, Sue Thomas

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:08.670
and J. B. Sutton, an interesting
family, mother and son.

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:09.970
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Yes.

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:11.540
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: What do
you remember about them?

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:15.480
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Well, I mean,
really what's memorable is

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.980
that when Frank Warner
went to the Outer Banks

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:21.280
from Duke University
just to go fishing --

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.820
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Before he
was interested in folk music.

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:26.260
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: I can see
him going into the kitchen,

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:29.910
he liked to eat, going into
the kitchen to meet the cook,

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:32.630
and that's where he met
Sue Thomas, who was a cook

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:34.740
at a fisherman's lodge.

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:39.370
And that was 1933,
before he was even think

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:41.160
about collecting songs.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.460
But, he loved her singing

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:45.630
and so he learned He's Got
the Whole World in His Hand

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:48.760
and Hold My Hand Lord
Jesus, songs that he sang

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.060
for the rest of his life.

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:54.600
And then, and mom was, too,
in '33, because as we have

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.910
that picture, sort of -- sort

00:21:56.910 --> 00:21:59.890
of like the very first
moment of collecting --

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:01.190
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:03.110
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Is
the way we see it.

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:05.120
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: No, I have --
we have no specific memories --

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.420
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
We don't, yeah.

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:07.720
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Because
we weren't there.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.020
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
You weren't around.

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:10.320
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
Weren't born yet.

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.620
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Right,
we weren't born yet.

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:12.920
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.220
But, it is a reflection of the
African-American side of things

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:15.520
on that part of their
collecting,

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:17.750
which I think people are less
familiar with to some extent.

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:19.050
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Yeah.

00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:20.350
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: There's --

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:21.650
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Because
they think of Frank Proffitt

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:22.950
and those great informants.

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:24.250
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: That's right.

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:25.550
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And
they think of your parents.

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:26.850
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: But, now, he
had, as Gerret was saying,

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:29.180
close friends as a child
in the black community

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:31.190
and he maintained that
through his whole life.

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:33.510
And, so, it was just axiomatic

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:36.340
that they would look
for those songs, too.

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:44.190
Joe Henry Johnson and Suffolk,
Virginia, and just part of it.

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:45.490
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:46.790
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: We
don't have any specific.

00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:48.090
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah, sure.

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:49.390
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: I wish we did.

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:50.690
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:51.990
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: There's lots

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:53.290
of things we wish
we could go back

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:54.590
and now look at with these eyes.

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:55.890
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:57.190
Well, so, let's talk
about Frank Proffitt.

00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:58.490
You mentioned the great
effect that he had on people.

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:02.970
What was that like
to meet him as a kid?

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.090
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Edit
this out [laughter].

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:10.550
No, because I really
-- we don't.

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:13.270
We just oozed into it.

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:19.650
Grew up and there was this
stoic, gentle, funny guy,

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:21.530
and listened to his music.

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:23.040
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: And he
walked us up to the top

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.800
of the mountain effortlessly,

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.080
and us two New York City
kids were just huffing

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:30.580
and puffing [laughter],
and stood up there

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:34.960
and told us stories about --
told us all the family stories.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:38.790
Well, you had a couple of
his humorous points of view.

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:40.460
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Yeah, but
we're telling them tonight,

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:41.760
and we were told
not to do here --

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:43.060
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Oh.

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:44.360
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: What we
were going to do tonight.

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:45.660
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Sorry,
Stephen [laughter].

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:46.960
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: No,
you could repeat some

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.260
of the stuff you're going
to talk about tonight.

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.320
But, it's just that
we're going to have video

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:52.770
of both events online so.

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:54.630
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Well, it just
it feels it's not so much funny

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:57.300
as it is a great moment.

00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:00.400
In '39, I think,
when they went back

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.230
and my father took binoculars,

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:05.550
which no one had ever
seen, in the mountains.

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:07.620
And, they went up to the top
of -- the top of the hill,

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:11.420
Watauga County, to
look into Tennessee,

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:13.310
and he showed everybody
binoculars,

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:15.450
to look into the mountains,
the Maryland mountains.

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:16.750
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Wow.

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:18.050
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: And then,
Frank Proffitt looked down

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:19.670
and my father said,
there's your --

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:21.650
there's your cornfield
right there.

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:23.630
And he looked down at it,
Frank did, and he said,

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:26.290
I don't see anybody hoeing
in it, though [laughter].

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:28.470
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: That
was Frank's kind of humor.

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:30.010
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: That's
Frank Proffitt.

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:31.610
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right, sure.

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:33.740
So, Frank is the person

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:37.350
from whom probably the
most famous song that came

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:39.880
out of the collation
was collected,

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:42.570
and that is Tom Dooley.

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:43.870
So, let's talk a little bit

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:46.200
about the whole Tom
Dooley issue.

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.120
The Kingston Trio, of course,

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.940
recorded Tom Dooley
in the late 1950's.

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:56.410
It was the biggest hit of
1958 and 1959, number one hit,

00:24:56.410 --> 00:25:00.070
became the first Grammy winner
in country and western music --

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:02.130
[ Multiple Speakers ]

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:05.100
Because the Grammy's
were created in 1959,

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:07.040
so it was the first one.

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.340
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Wow.

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:09.900
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And this
created kind of an issue

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:12.630
for Frank, from whom
the song was collected.

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:13.930
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Frank Proffitt.

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:15.230
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: From
Frank Proffitt, yeah, sorry.

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:16.530
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Yeah,
yeah, yeah.

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:17.830
That's a --

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:19.130
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:20.430
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Lifelong
problem --

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:21.730
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:23.030
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Of Frank
Proffitt and Frank Warner.

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:24.330
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:25.630
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Yeah,
he had taught Tom Dooley

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:28.840
to Frank Warner in 1938,
and it took that long time,

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:32.640
to '58 for it to find its
way into Capital Records

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.250
and the Kingston Trio.

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:37.640
So, when Frank Proffitt saw
it on television and saw it

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:42.280
so urbanized, as it was, with
the fancy shirts and dancing --

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.580
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:46.070
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: He -- I
guess I can understand it.

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:47.790
He thought he was
being made fun of.

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:49.090
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Yeah.

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:50.390
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: As a
-- as a rural hick.

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:51.970
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: He was
offended, really offended.

00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:54.670
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: And he said, at
least he wrote to my parents,

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:56.710
he wanted to go shoot him.

00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:58.010
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:25:58.010 --> 00:26:03.390
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: So, my folks,
who had not seen him since '41,

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:05.920
I think I just came
to that conclusion.

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:10.380
In 1959, but we hadn't
seen him since 1941.

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:11.680
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: But,
they had corresponded.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.980
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Corresponded.

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:17.160
My father, I guess, got on a
train and went down to see him

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:20.480
to convince Frank Proffitt that
he was not being made fun of,

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.300
it was just a progression
of events.

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:26.370
And, Frank almost immediately,
from what we can tell,

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:29.540
came to understand it was
okay and that, in fact,

00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:34.150
it was a Frank Proffitt mountain
contribution to society.

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:36.030
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
Yeah, I would just --

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:38.390
I would just confirm
that's what --

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:41.960
that was Frank Proffitt's
own take on it.

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.260
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Which was what?

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:44.560
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
Was that he had --

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:49.190
he had come to accept it as
part of what was his obligation

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:52.820
to his heritage, was to
pass it along to everyone.

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:55.830
But, it must've been
quite a tough transition.

00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:58.080
The way he describes it
in writing is, you know,

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.850
paragraph to paragraph, but you
can imagine him mulling this

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:03.220
for a long time alone up there

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:05.260
in the mountains
and feeling hurt.

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:06.560
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:08.650
Well, I think it says a lot
about your parents, too,

00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:10.600
that they went back
to visit him.

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:12.930
They didn't just write
him a letter or whatever.

00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:14.230
They actually --

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:15.530
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Boy,
you got a point.

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:16.830
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Went and --

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:18.130
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: I
think that's true.

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:19.430
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:20.730
And one of the things that
came out of that actually is,

00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:22.030
they made of a much
clearer recording

00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:24.720
of him performing the song
in '59 than they had before.

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.170
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Went back
in '59, it's all part

00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:27.470
of the steel, isn't it?

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:28.770
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:30.070
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Went back
in '59, lots and lots

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:32.060
of interviews and songs of him.

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:33.360
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.840
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: And
that inspired, I guess,

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:37.850
I don't know the
exact chain of events,

00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:41.290
but within two years my
father took Frank Proffitt

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:43.980
to the Chicago Folk
Festival to perform there,

00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:47.860
and that was his first
outing into society to play,

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:49.890
which was followed by
the Newport Folk Festival

00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:51.710
and by the World's Fair.

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:54.890
And he represented the
state of North Carolina

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:56.190
at the World's Fair in '65.

00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:57.490
Whoa.

00:27:57.490 --> 00:28:01.280
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: As you
know, the change from 1941

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:03.590
to 1959 is quite dramatic --

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:04.890
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:06.190
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
From Jimmy Rogers

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:08.010
to this old-time fretless
banjo presentation --

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:09.310
[ Multiple Speakers ]

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:10.610
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yes.

00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:12.100
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
Sorry, Frank [inaudible].

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:13.780
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Very much so, yeah.

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:16.200
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Yeah, but,
so that first presentation

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:19.330
of Frank Proffitt to the world
at the Chicago Folk Festival was

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:22.710
with a fretless banjo
singing old-time style,

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:25.370
but it had come a
long way from 1941.

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:26.670
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:27.970
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
For whatever reason.

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:29.270
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:30.570
And then, of course, other
people collected him, too.

00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:33.000
He ended up with the folk legacy
album and things like that.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.300
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: That's right.

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:36.780
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So, he
had something of a career

00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:38.500
as a musician after that --

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:39.800
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Correct.

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:41.260
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Which
was an outcome that a few

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:45.140
of the traditional
performers were able to do,

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:48.020
and that was a great
thing as well.

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:50.140
So, let's talk about the
folk revival a little bit.

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:51.700
I mean, we've talked
about the Kingston Trio,

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:54.010
but you guys must've
met, as kids,

00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:55.870
and then later throughout
your lives,

00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:57.830
pretty much everyone [laughter].

00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:02.450
I mean, [inaudible] and Alan
Lomax and all those folks.

00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:05.820
So, who made the biggest
impressions on you?

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:07.120
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Alan Lomax.

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.420
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Absolutely.

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:09.720
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Giant
bear of a guy.

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:11.020
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Yeah.

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:12.480
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Who
was like a 37% kid --

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:13.780
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:15.080
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Anyway.

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.260
And he insisted on coming out
and playing baseball with us.

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:20.310
So, we'd hit fungos
and chase ground balls,

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:21.610
I can remember that.

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:23.650
And, essentially, scary.

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:25.840
I mean, just such
a big personality.

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:27.140
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: He was.

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:28.440
He was.

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:29.740
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Our father
had a big personality, too,

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:32.050
but it was as this kind
and gentle kind of way.

00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:37.690
And, Alan was just [making
sounds with mouth] big stuff.

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:41.760
He once called me up and, my
memory is, he wanted me to come,

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:46.260
leave my music school that
I was running, and help him

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:50.850
at Columbia University with his
Cantor metrics project he was

00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:52.440
working on.

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:56.960
I remember being a
10-year-old or a 12-year-old

00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:58.720
and said, no, thank you, sir.

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:00.020
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
That's interesting.

00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:01.320
I didn't know that story.

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:02.620
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Yeah, he called
me up at the guitar workshop.

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:05.330
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: He invited
me to help him edit that--

00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:08.470
what was the series on NET?

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:09.770
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Oh, yes, right.

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:11.070
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
American Patchwork one?

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:12.370
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Yeah.

00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:13.670
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:14.970
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: I
just couldn't do it.

00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:16.270
I had a job and --

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:17.570
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:18.870
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: No,
that's funny.

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:20.170
I didn't know that
either [laughter].

00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:21.470
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: He didn't
say he'd pay me [laughter].

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:22.770
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: We should --
we should this more often.

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:24.070
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: He
just said come do it.

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:25.370
But, he was that kind of
gregarious, big personality.

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:27.020
But, man, when he came to a
party and sang, it was just --

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:28.920
I loved Alan Lomax's singing.

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:30.220
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Yeah.

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:31.520
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: A lot of
people don't seem to talk

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:32.820
about his singing so much

00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:34.120
because of his influence
in collecting.

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:35.420
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:36.720
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: And
knowing people was so big,

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:38.310
but his singing was
really a beautiful thing.

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:39.970
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: He was
like your father in that way,

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:41.580
too, that he did both.

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:42.880
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Yeah.

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.180
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:45.480
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: And Pete Seeger.

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.140
I mean, we worked for Pete
Seeger on the Clearwater

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:51.200
in 1973, going around Long
Island [inaudible] doing

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:57.020
concerts to raise awareness
of ecology on the boat.

00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:01.810
Pete Seeger, I don't know
how much of this we want

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:04.320
to get into, but I
think Pete Seeger asked,

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.850
according to the
family story anyway,

00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:10.100
my father to join
the Communist Party.

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:14.390
And they didn't want to
because, well, YMCA director.

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:15.690
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:19.250
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: We always joke
that I'm the only folksinger

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:22.930
to come from Republican
folk singers in New York.

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:25.640
And, of course, the politics
were different at the time.

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:26.940
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: It's
very different Republicans.

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:28.240
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Yeah, exactly.

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.040
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: My folks always
said that they were concerned

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:32.510
with Tammany Hall and the
Democratic control of New York.

00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:33.810
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:35.110
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: And, so,
they voted otherwise.

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:36.410
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:37.710
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: But, no,
they were teetotalers

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:39.820
and it took us a
long time to get mom

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:42.520
to become a good Liberal.

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:45.720
And, who else?

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:47.960
I'd say the [inaudible].

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:49.260
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Jean Ritchie.

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:50.560
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Jean
Ritchie, yes.

00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:51.860
We grew up with Jean Ritchie.

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:53.160
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Yeah, we were
always close with the Richie

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:55.350
and Pico's [assumed spelling]
and spent a lot of time

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:57.980
with them, both in New York and
then later in Port Washington.

00:31:57.980 --> 00:31:59.280
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:03.470
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: And we were just
behind the Greenwich Village

00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:07.050
folk music craze
and joyous things

00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:08.350
that happened in the '50s.

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:11.450
And John Cohen and Mike
Seeger and people playing

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:13.600
and forming the New
Lost City Ramblers,

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.510
which I see as this
amazing moment in 1958.

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:17.810
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Absolutely, yeah.

00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:19.110
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Almost as much

00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:20.410
as the Kington Trio
coming out --

00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:21.710
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:24.610
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Where suddenly
traditional music style

00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:26.290
became important.

00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:27.590
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah,
it's sort of the two sides

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:29.390
of the revival there
happening at the same time.

00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:30.850
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Yes,
yes, yes, yes.

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:32.150
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:33.450
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: I talk
about that whenever I can.

00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:34.750
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:36.050
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: About
how style evolved.

00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:37.350
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:38.650
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: And
then later, I mean,

00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:41.140
I've never quite understood
what kind of thinking there was

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:44.070
in those early days of
the Newport Folk Festival,

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:47.420
because it was such a
tapestry of types of music.

00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:50.160
I can remember John
Lomax standing --

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.270
I mean, Alan Lomax
standing there and listening

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:54.960
to Jose Feliciano play guitar

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:58.430
and just going wild
with enthusiasm.

00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:00.250
So, you know, and
just Big Brother

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:02.010
and the Holding Company
and Janice Joplin.

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:03.310
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Yeah, right.

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:04.610
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: So, they
were all melded together.

00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:06.610
That feels like a
lot of my youth.

00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:08.210
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:09.760
Well, it's almost
like we planned it,

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:11.060
because all of the people

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:13.830
that you mentioned are major
collection donors here at the --

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:15.190
at the Folklife Center.

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:16.490
We have collections from --

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:17.790
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Really?

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:19.090
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: John Cohen,

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:20.390
from Mike Seeger,
from Jean Ritchie --

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:21.690
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Oh.

00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:22.990
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
And [inaudible].

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:24.290
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: That's great.

00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:25.590
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
All of those --

00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:26.890
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: That's great.

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:28.190
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Are --
and Pete Seeger, of course.

00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:29.490
And then, of course,

00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:30.790
Lomax worked here
early on in his career.

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:32.090
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
It's funny that --

00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:33.390
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And we have
all his collections now, so.

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:34.690
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: There's a
lot of photographs that I think

00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:35.990
of in terms of our
history with folk music

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:37.290
that George Pico took.

00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:38.590
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah, sure.

00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:39.890
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Because
he and Jean and Frank Warner

00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:41.590
and Anne Warner were always
somehow the same parties,

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:42.890
same places.

00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:44.190
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: And we
grew up with their kids.

00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:45.490
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:46.790
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: And --

00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:48.090
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Yeah.

00:33:48.090 --> 00:33:49.390
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Well, let's
talk about that a little bit,

00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:50.690
about Frank as a photographer,

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:51.990
because we were talking
about that before.

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:53.290
That's an interesting part
of Frank Warner, I mean,

00:33:53.290 --> 00:33:54.590
to say as a photographer.

00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:55.890
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Yeah.

00:33:55.890 --> 00:33:57.190
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Something

00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:58.490
that people don't
know that much about.

00:33:58.490 --> 00:33:59.840
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Yeah, well,
he had no formal training,

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:03.610
but he -- I think he brought
his storytelling skills

00:34:03.610 --> 00:34:04.910
to photography.

00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:06.910
And I've thought of
that a lot, that --

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:10.250
you know, you can sort of take a
series of photographs of things

00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:12.330
that you think look unique,

00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:16.170
but in many cases you'll find
he's taken pictures that help

00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:21.080
to tell the narrative
visually that mom was writing.

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:25.330
And, it probably came out of the
YMCA, because he was, you know,

00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:28.130
doing lots of things
with camps and so on.

00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:31.060
And, he had -- he used
to tell me a story.

00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:33.510
I think a lot of people know
this kind of foolishness.

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:39.220
But, he used to love to -- you
know those long, panoramic shots

00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:41.430
that they did of
groups in the 1920's?

00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:42.730
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah, yeah.

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:44.030
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: So, they
would stand at one side and run

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:45.760
around behind the back as
it panned, and you'd be

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.210
on both sides of the photograph?

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:48.510
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:49.810
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
So, he was fascinated

00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:51.110
with how technology worked.

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:53.050
And, I think, that's
probably why he ended

00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:58.850
up with the 2 1/4 inch
negative twin lens reflex camera

00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:01.630
that I remember from the '50s.

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:04.580
And, that took a
pretty nice photograph.

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:06.750
And, it also influenced,
I think, a little bit --

00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:08.150
some people say if
you use a camera

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:10.720
like that it makes
people more comfortable

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.940
than a single end
reflex, you know,

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:14.240
where you're holding it up --

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:15.540
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:16.840
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
And looking at them.

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:18.140
I have no idea about
that, but he took --

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:19.440
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: He
looked down into it.

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:20.740
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: He looked
down into it to a projection.

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:22.040
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:23.340
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
And that was most

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:24.640
of the photographs that I know.

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:26.330
The negative, I don't know
what this is, but the negative

00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:28.660
that I came across that is a lot

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:32.860
of the early photographs was
more like two by 1 1/2 inches.

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:34.160
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Interesting.

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:35.460
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
About that size.

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:36.930
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Yeah, all right.

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:41.260
And, so, his composition
and that kind of thing,

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:43.570
was that an influence on
you in your later work?

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:44.870
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
I'd like to think so.

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:47.140
Certainly, his whole
approach to subjects,

00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:49.580
making people feel
comfortable, and so on.

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:51.000
But, he had -- he
had a nice eye.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.920
I mean, like Ray Hicks
was about six foot eight,

00:35:54.920 --> 00:36:01.670
and he stood him beside a broom
against a wall, and I thought,

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:03.570
well, it's kind of a
scientific approach.

00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:04.870
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:06.170
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: But, it's
humorous because he also did one

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:10.360
of Ray with a groundhog on his
shoulder, kind of laughing.

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:15.250
And then great of family
portraiture, like, you know,

00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:18.450
four girls on a porch with
old Ben Hicks staring at them,

00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:20.930
standing right beside them,
and there's Frank Proffitt

00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:25.340
and Bessie Proffitt standing
behind them looking very

00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:29.430
mountain disengaged, but it
tells this whole story just

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:30.730
in that one photograph.

00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:32.030
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:33.330
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: And
there are a lot of those.

00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:34.630
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:35.930
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Like
a whole bunch of --

00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:40.990
it'd be 10 girls all composed
in this pyramid, all thrilled

00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:42.920
to be meeting somebody
from off the mountain.

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:44.350
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Sure.

00:36:44.350 --> 00:36:45.800
And there are a few
those kind of shots

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:47.120
with you guys in them as well.

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:48.420
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Yeah, yeah.

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:51.100
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Were
you used as props in the --

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:53.020
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: We were
just tools [laughter].

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:54.460
Yeah, nobody cared about us.

00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:56.570
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: A lot
of pictures in 1959

00:36:56.570 --> 00:36:59.700
on Beech Mountain there
at the Nathan Hicks' house

00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:02.570
where it was the center of
so many pictures and music --

00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:03.870
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Sure.

00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:05.170
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: On
Beech Mountain.

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:06.470
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: It's part
of that whole thing about,

00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:09.840
to what extent were they
conscious of the value of thing

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:14.120
to later years, is
endlessly interesting to me.

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:16.680
And, one of the pieces
of evidence is

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:20.510
that he took photographs
of my mother recording

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:22.980
with each one of
those recorders.

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:26.760
So, he was aware that, okay,
we're doing something here

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:29.540
that we're going to
wish we had a record of.

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:30.840
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah,

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:32.380
and those are actually very
useful photos, actually.

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:33.680
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Yeah.

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:34.980
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: There
aren't that many photos

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:36.280
of those machines in use.

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:37.580
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Yeah.

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:38.880
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: There's
photos of the machines

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.240
and there's photos of
performers, but there's not

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:42.480
that many photos that
actually show them being used.

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:43.780
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: And the setup

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:45.080
of where the microphone
is and how the person --

00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:46.380
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: All that.

00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:47.680
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
Is handling it and.

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:48.980
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah,

00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:51.050
it's great to have those photos
associated with the collection.

00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:52.350
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Yeah.

00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:54.120
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Do you happen to
know what Herbert Halpert used

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:57.500
when he recorded on Beech
Mountain in '39 and stuff?

00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:00.780
Was he using [inaudible] things?

00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:03.620
Because we know that John
and Alan Lomax used portable,

00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:06.800
but in quotes, because
it was enormously heavy.

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:08.100
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:09.400
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: In '35

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:10.700
or whenever they were
out there looking?

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:12.000
But, I don't know what he used.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.340
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So, the
famous picture that we have

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:15.860
of Halpert, that might
help answer that question,

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:19.050
has got him with
a large vehicle,

00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:20.390
it's almost like an ambulance.

00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:21.690
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Oh, yes, yes.

00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:22.990
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And,
so, it seems likely

00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:24.310
that he was using
something big and bulky,

00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:25.960
if that's what he was using.

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:27.260
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: The
[inaudible] photograph.

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:28.560
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: But, I --

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:29.860
yeah, but I don't know

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:31.210
which trip that's
associated with necessarily.

00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:32.740
It was associated
with the south though,

00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:34.660
it was one of his
southern states.

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:37.080
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: So, this
may be the first Library

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:41.250
of Congress donated
recordings on a small --

00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:42.550
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:43.850
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Portable
disc cutter.

00:38:43.850 --> 00:38:45.150
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
We don't know.

00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:46.450
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: We don't know.

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:49.390
Someone knows, but
it's not me [laughter].

00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:51.840
So, that opens another
question, which is,

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:55.110
how did this great collection
that your parents amassed,

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:58.690
essentially as a private
hobby, how did that end

00:38:58.690 --> 00:38:59.990
up at the Library of Congress?

00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:03.630
How did they make that decision?

00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:04.930
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: [Inaudible].

00:39:04.930 --> 00:39:07.170
I don't know, I think
it's just this connection

00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:10.530
between folk music and
academe that they got

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:13.010
through the New York
Historical Society,

00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:15.110
connection with Alan Lomax.

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:16.410
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: That's
what I was going to say.

00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:17.710
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Yeah.

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:19.010
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Alan Lomax
would have probably been --

00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:20.310
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Preserved,
preserved, preserved.

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:21.610
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Principle --

00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:22.910
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: We
remember when I --

00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:26.150
when I came down my parents
decided to donate everything

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:29.740
to the Library of Congress,
'70, mid '70s sometime.

00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:32.720
First, as a family, we all
listened to it altogether.

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:35.750
Then we took all those
recordings down and gave them

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:38.530
to the Library of Congress in
return for good reel-to-reels.

00:39:38.530 --> 00:39:39.830
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:41.130
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: And,
at the time,

00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:43.620
I found out that the parents
had given everything --

00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:47.590
had given tape in 1951,
and I didn't know that.

00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:49.010
How did that happen?

00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:52.190
And then, I remembered that my
father had assiduously taken all

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:55.340
of their records and put
them on his reel-to-reel tape

00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:58.840
and had given those
copies to the Library.

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:00.140
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Interesting.

00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:01.440
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: So, even then --

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:02.740
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:04.040
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: He realized
where it should go --

00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:05.340
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:06.640
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: In '51.

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:07.940
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So,

00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:11.860
let's talk about your
individual careers a little bit.

00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:15.180
Gerret, you are a
filmmaker, a media producer.

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:19.980
So, how has this early
life, do you think,

00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:23.640
how has it influenced
what you've done later?

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:24.940
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Well,

00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:27.370
it's interesting how
one's life turns.

00:40:27.370 --> 00:40:30.720
But, early on Jeff and I did
a lot of singing together.

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:34.700
But, at some point, I realized
it wasn't a career for me.

00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:38.710
And, what I -- what I was
most influenced by was,

00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:40.750
I thought that at
some point very early

00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:45.200
on that I might make films the
way my parents collected songs,

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:47.150
but I never could
quite figure that out.

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:50.390
All the people they
collected from had died,

00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:55.920
now their children are gone,
and so I ended up moving back

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:58.060
and forth between
teaching and filmmaking.

00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:02.860
And then, since 1984, I've
had my own film company,

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:07.510
specializing pretty much in
nonprofit kinds of films.

00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:09.860
But, now I'm working
on documentaries.

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:14.550
And, it's actually the donation
here that has helped me decide,

00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:18.970
yes, this is -- we should now
finally make this story a film.

00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:21.160
So, I've just begun
working on that.

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:22.460
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So,
you're making a film

00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:25.400
about the Warners
and their collecting?

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:27.690
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: But, to
also answer your question,

00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:30.490
the way my parents collected
has influenced everything

00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:36.180
about the way that I interview,
particularly, of recognizing

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:40.160
that if you want to ask
somebody a set of questions,

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:43.660
the amount of time that you
spend before you interview them

00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:45.360
is at least as important
as the time

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:46.840
in which you interview them.

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:48.140
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Is that true?

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:49.440
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: It is.

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:51.240
That's why I'm sitting here with
his crazy clipboard [laughter].

00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:54.360
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: But, it
isn't only about content.

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:55.660
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:56.960
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: It's
about the mood you set,

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:59.010
it's about the establishment
of trust.

00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:00.310
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:02.130
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: All of that
is really what's going on.

00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:05.510
And people want to share
information, that's what --

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:07.370
I also learned that from them.

00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:09.640
They want to share
information if they trust you.

00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:10.940
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:12.240
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: And, so,
there's this whole thing,

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:16.550
exchange of trusts, and I think
there's a lot to explore there.

00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:20.080
But, I learned it whole
cloth, mostly from my father,

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:23.110
because I think that was
his great contribution

00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:26.030
to those collecting moments.

00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:27.330
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: I never
heard you say that,

00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:29.610
and that's profound, Gerret.

00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:30.910
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Hmm.

00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:32.660
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: There you go.

00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:35.320
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: But, it's --

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:39.090
I think of it actually
all the time.

00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:42.640
You know, that -- because I can
remember him sitting and talking

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:45.210
to some of these people,
particularly Beech Mountain,

00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:48.950
but other places, too,
and he had the same skill

00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:50.250
when he met somebody
on the street.

00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:51.760
I mean, that was Frank Warner.

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:53.060
You know, that he
would just sort

00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:57.120
of stop somebody
and talk to them.

00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:59.140
So, yeah, I like to think
I got a little bit of it.

00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:00.440
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Sure.

00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:02.830
And what are some of the
film projects over the years

00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:04.970
that stand out in your
memory that you've worked on,

00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:07.800
if you can pick among
your artistic children?

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:09.100
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Well, I mean,

00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:11.040
I love a film we did
about Polly Hill.

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:15.500
It was a-- it's not related
to folk music, but she was --

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:19.400
she had inherited this sheep
farm on Martha's Vineyard

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:22.200
in her 50's and she
decided she want

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:24.670
to turn it into an arboretum.

00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:29.320
And, by the time we met her,
she was 94, and she turned it

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:32.360
into a world-class arboretum.

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:33.660
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Wow.

00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:34.960
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: And,
it's now a nonprofit

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.620
on Martha's Vineyard
you can go visit.

00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:39.380
It's a -- it's a
remarkable place.

00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:41.530
And another that
we worked on for --

00:43:41.530 --> 00:43:44.230
Mimi and I have worked on
this for about seven years,

00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:45.970
is about Vollis Simpson,

00:43:45.970 --> 00:43:50.520
who is a remarkable outside
artist, as they call him.

00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:53.540
I don't really buy
that term, but.

00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:57.120
He had grown up as a
mechanic, and at about age 50,

00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:59.960
maybe that's a turning point
in life, at about age 50,

00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:04.540
like Polly Hill, he turned
his old mechanic stuff

00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:08.310
into these ornamental
windmills, whirligigs.

00:44:08.310 --> 00:44:11.510
And, so, we've documented
him for all those years

00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:13.690
until he died, about
three or four years ago.

00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:14.990
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Where
does he live?

00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:16.290
Where did he live?

00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:17.590
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
Wilson, North Carolina.

00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:18.890
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Wilson,
North Carolina.

00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:20.190
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: And, so,
we have all of that footage.

00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:21.490
We shot it for the North
Carolina Arts Council

00:44:21.490 --> 00:44:25.530
and Wilson, and I
think it's about time.

00:44:25.530 --> 00:44:28.290
We got to put it together into
something as a finished product.

00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:29.590
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Sounds good.

00:44:29.590 --> 00:44:30.890
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: But,
yeah, we love those.

00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:33.260
And they're all very
much informed by the --

00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:36.020
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: How about
your Truth Underground?

00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:38.010
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Well, that's
a different kettle of fish, too,

00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:39.500
but something I'm really proud.

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:46.500
Ned and Mimi and I all worked on
a film about spoken word poetry.

00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:50.570
It's a -- it features three
poets from the triangle area

00:44:50.570 --> 00:44:55.080
of North Carolina and their art
and what the relationship was.

00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:57.180
We did that in 2016.

00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:58.980
So, a future documentary.

00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:00.450
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Excellent.

00:45:00.450 --> 00:45:02.590
Well, those all sound
like fabulous films,

00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:05.330
so we'll keep an eye out for
the one that's not finished yet.

00:45:05.330 --> 00:45:06.630
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Thanks.

00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:07.950
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Yeah, and thank you.

00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:13.010
And, Jeff, you've been a folk
musician all these years.

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:14.310
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Yeah.

00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:15.610
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: An
actual professional,

00:45:15.610 --> 00:45:16.910
full-time folk musician.

00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:18.210
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: It's hard
to believe, isn't it?

00:45:18.210 --> 00:45:19.510
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
Someone actually has done

00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:20.810
that [laughter].

00:45:20.810 --> 00:45:22.620
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So, what are
some of the highlights for you

00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:24.440
of that whole experience?

00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:26.460
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Well,
just oozing into it,

00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:29.300
and then the amount of work that
I have done with young people

00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:31.320
in schools, I just -- I
don't think I would've been a

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:34.850
professional doing
real traditional music,

00:45:34.850 --> 00:45:36.490
which is what I like
to think that I do,

00:45:36.490 --> 00:45:39.650
even though I'm an urban person.

00:45:39.650 --> 00:45:43.310
I got out of college in the
service and never expected to be

00:45:43.310 --> 00:45:46.290
in folk music, other
than having fun.

00:45:46.290 --> 00:45:50.320
Started working at Doubleday
and trying to be an editor.

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:56.160
And then, after three years
there, a friend of mine asked me

00:45:56.160 --> 00:46:00.410
if I would leave that and
come help run a music school

00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:03.960
in Long Island with him, a place
called The Guitar Workshop.

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:06.610
And, I said, uh-oh, now
I've got to make a decision.

00:46:06.610 --> 00:46:07.910
So, I decided to do that.

00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:13.820
And, for 10 years, I helped
run that school, taught,

00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:16.370
and began to -- we did seminars,

00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:19.300
as well as just teach
individual instruments.

00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:22.970
And we did seminars on
teaching about traditional music

00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:25.050
and about how to sing.

00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:28.910
And I ran several folk
music concert series,

00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:31.160
where I got to know most
of the folk revival going

00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:34.890
on by hiring them to come
and play on Long Island,

00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:37.500
and it was a great education.

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:42.640
And, then the bicentennial
happened and I began to be asked

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:45.740
to go to schools to
teach American history

00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:47.620
through traditional song.

00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:51.190
And I did and developed
my skills in being

00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:53.130
to talk to kids about that.

00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:56.260
Without that, I would not
have had a full-time career --

00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:57.560
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Yeah, you do --

00:46:57.560 --> 00:46:58.860
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Because
I never --

00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:00.160
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Quite a bit
of work in schools with kids.

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:01.460
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: I do, I do.

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:02.760
And I have never written
a song in my life,

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:04.770
nor have the urge to do it.

00:47:04.770 --> 00:47:07.120
You know, there's never been
this thing, well, you know,

00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:08.980
just all this great
stuff and why don't I do

00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:10.280
that kind of thing, too.

00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:12.730
No, I'm perfectly happy learning

00:47:12.730 --> 00:47:15.280
about the old songs
and carrying them on.

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:17.650
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: You do
some songs that we know

00:47:17.650 --> 00:47:21.860
who the writers are, and some,
occasionally, as opposed to --

00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:23.160
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Absolutely
right.

00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:24.460
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: The
deep traditions, but --

00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:25.760
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Something
will strike me and I say,

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:27.110
I love that song,
and I'll do it,

00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:29.480
just I don't need to write them.

00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:32.920
Where was I headed with this?

00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:39.130
Oh, yeah. Somebody said to me
that [inaudible] about the power

00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:41.330
of traditional music
and why it became

00:47:41.330 --> 00:47:43.580
so important on the
folk revival.

00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:46.900
Somebody, a friend, said that
he grew up in Canada and he used

00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:50.650
to live in Toronto in the
late '50s and he would listen

00:47:50.650 --> 00:47:53.130
to U.S. radio across
the Great Lakes.

00:47:53.130 --> 00:47:55.810
And he said, and he heard
this song, Tom Dooley,

00:47:55.810 --> 00:47:59.060
and it was about real life.

00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:03.180
It was about a murder, and about
things that happened to people.

00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:07.320
And he said to himself, why
can't I write things like that,

00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:10.600
too, about real people and
real things that are happening?

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:12.590
I had never seen that connection

00:48:12.590 --> 00:48:16.010
to the folk revival
of singer songwriter.

00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:17.310
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:48:17.310 --> 00:48:18.610
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Of
taking real-life events

00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:20.480
and then translating
that into their own life,

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:22.890
but using the style
or the feeling

00:48:22.890 --> 00:48:24.560
of traditional music to do it.

00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:27.640
For me, it had always been,
here come the old songs

00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:30.360
and it's my job to let
people know about them.

00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:31.660
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: I've never
heard you say something

00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:32.960
like that.

00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:34.260
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Profound.

00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:35.560
No, no [laughter].

00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:36.860
Strike that.

00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:38.160
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: No, it's just
interesting because, I mean,

00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:39.730
like it reminds me of the
song Away Idaho, right,

00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:42.350
which like they collected
from someone.

00:48:42.350 --> 00:48:46.350
But, it was Away Arkansas
before it was Away Idaho.

00:48:46.350 --> 00:48:50.780
It was about hot springs baths
and then it was about gold.

00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:54.940
So, it was essentially the same
thing as the singer songwriter,

00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:57.170
except 19th century probably.

00:48:57.170 --> 00:48:58.470
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:48:58.470 --> 00:48:59.770
So, using -- recycling
an old song.

00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:01.070
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Yeah, which
I think is probably what's

00:49:01.070 --> 00:49:02.370
happened since the
beginning of time.

00:49:02.370 --> 00:49:03.670
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:04.970
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: So,
I did that a lot.

00:49:04.970 --> 00:49:07.440
I worked for The Guitar
Workshop doing concert series,

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:09.750
and then I worked in
schools quite a bit.

00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:12.420
I had a childhood
friend of ours,

00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:14.020
a guy named Jeff Davis
[assumed spelling], who,

00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:16.550
one of the reasons I do
northern songs all the time is

00:49:16.550 --> 00:49:20.800
because Jeff Davis was such a
good copier of Frank Proffitt.

00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:23.090
In some ways he became
Frank Proffitt.

00:49:23.090 --> 00:49:24.920
He could do all of
the banjo styles

00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:27.120
and the vocal styles
of Frank Proffitt.

00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:29.470
And, he kind of took care
of the southern stuff

00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:31.410
in our -- in our repertoire.

00:49:31.410 --> 00:49:35.530
And, I was big on sea shanties
and sea songs and songs

00:49:35.530 --> 00:49:37.130
that came out of
the logging camps.

00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:38.930
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: You could
have a show called Jeff

00:49:38.930 --> 00:49:42.860
and Jeff Do Frank
and Frank [laughter].

00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:44.160
So --

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:45.460
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
Hey, next concert.

00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:47.590
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: That's right,
yeah, that'll be your next.

00:49:47.590 --> 00:49:50.860
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: And then, in the
last 15 years, I've had a chance

00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:54.770
to spend two months a year
in the British Folk Revival,

00:49:54.770 --> 00:49:58.330
which has been just
an eye-opener for me.

00:49:58.330 --> 00:50:02.760
I say lightly to folks,
especially over there,

00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:06.450
that I tend to go to
the UK to talk to people

00:50:06.450 --> 00:50:08.740
who know something
about traditional music,

00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:12.320
and most of my work in America
is starting from ground zero.

00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:16.270
I work with New Hampshire
Humanities and libraries

00:50:16.270 --> 00:50:19.960
and civic societies and
historical societies beginning

00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:21.840
to tell people about
New Hampshire music --

00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:23.140
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Sure.

00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:24.440
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: And
New England music.

00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:25.920
But, over there, there's
300 folk festivals.

00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:29.200
Whoa. And still, folklore
is in every little town.

00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:30.500
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:32.380
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: So, I spend
two months touring and get

00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:35.850
to do some of their
music that they gave us,

00:50:35.850 --> 00:50:38.610
after 200 years I give it back.

00:50:38.610 --> 00:50:39.910
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:42.710
Yeah, and, you know, it's
actually very interesting

00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:46.490
to see those connections between
what's going on in Britain and,

00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:47.860
particularly the
New England side

00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:50.110
of the American folk revival,
I would say, because there's

00:50:50.110 --> 00:50:51.840
such deep similarities there.

00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:53.140
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: It's deep.

00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:54.590
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So, well,

00:50:54.590 --> 00:50:56.310
so you've revisited
the collection a number

00:50:56.310 --> 00:50:57.850
of times over the years.

00:50:57.850 --> 00:51:00.050
Once was, of course, when
your mother was working

00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:03.430
on the book in, what
would it be, the 1980's.

00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:04.730
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Right.

00:51:04.730 --> 00:51:06.030
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And
you would have helped her

00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:07.330
to some extent --

00:51:07.330 --> 00:51:08.630
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Yes.

00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:09.930
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: With that.

00:51:09.930 --> 00:51:11.230
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Yeah,
Jeff was the editor.

00:51:11.230 --> 00:51:12.530
[ Inaudible ]

00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:13.830
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
So, what was that like

00:51:13.830 --> 00:51:15.130
to go back to that collection?

00:51:15.130 --> 00:51:16.430
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Oh, magnificent.

00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:19.690
I said in '74, before we
gave the whole collection

00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:21.990
to the Library, we --
the family sat down

00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:23.290
and listened to everything.

00:51:23.290 --> 00:51:24.590
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:27.140
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: And then
my father got sick in '77.

00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:28.890
They had gotten a
grant from Humanities,

00:51:28.890 --> 00:51:31.180
National Humanities,
to publish the book.

00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:35.550
But, Frank Warner got
ill and died in '78.

00:51:35.550 --> 00:51:39.750
And, as Gerret says,
heroically, and Warner went

00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:41.370
on and wrote that book.

00:51:41.370 --> 00:51:42.670
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:51:42.670 --> 00:51:43.970
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Didn't
get it done --

00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:45.270
we didn't get it done until '84,

00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:47.030
but that's when she
got it published.

00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:50.870
And then, again, in 1999 --

00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:52.170
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
In the '90s, yeah.

00:51:52.170 --> 00:51:53.470
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Gerret
and I listened

00:51:53.470 --> 00:51:55.900
to the entire collection
because a guy,

00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:58.970
a folk singer named Tim
Erickson, a folk revival singer,

00:51:58.970 --> 00:52:03.190
was singing for Appleseed
Records and he spurred us

00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:08.030
on to get the collection in
order for it being on record.

00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:12.300
And then convinced Appleseed
that they should publish it.

00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:13.600
So --

00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:14.900
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: It
was a great moment.

00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:16.200
Yeah, it kind of got us
back together working --

00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:17.500
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: It
got us back together.

00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:18.800
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: On
the collection.

00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:20.100
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: We spent --

00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:21.400
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Digging into it.

00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:22.700
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: A whole
year listening, again,

00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:24.000
to the entire collection.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.300
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Yeah.

00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:26.600
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: And
then, instead of looking

00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:27.900
at what is most important in
terms of American history,

00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:29.780
it was what sounds good?

00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:32.920
What are people going to be --
what will perk up their ears

00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:35.490
to the sound of traditional
singers singing

00:52:35.490 --> 00:52:36.790
songs [inaudible].

00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:39.100
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: You know,
I was thinking, too, I mean,

00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:40.710
at some point I think
you were talking

00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:43.210
about how we decided
what would go on --

00:52:43.210 --> 00:52:44.510
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:46.120
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: To the CD's,
and it was a difficult decision,

00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:47.770
and plenty of arguments.

00:52:47.770 --> 00:52:53.480
But, in the end, I think,
what I believed was the nature

00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:57.540
of documentation is
recording the unknown.

00:52:57.540 --> 00:52:59.320
You don't know what's
coming at you.

00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:02.080
And, I kept thinking about
the places in which Anne

00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:04.330
and Frank Warner
had collected songs.

00:53:04.330 --> 00:53:07.890
It wasn't only in these pockets
that people might know about.

00:53:07.890 --> 00:53:11.620
You know, Cecil Sharp had been
up there and let's go find it,

00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:14.490
but at the Commodore
Hotel in New York,

00:53:14.490 --> 00:53:18.490
or in the kitchen
of a friend's house.

00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:22.570
And, so, I began to think, this
should be documentary in style.

00:53:22.570 --> 00:53:25.570
This should give you a
feeling for the surprise

00:53:25.570 --> 00:53:28.940
of any old thing you might find,

00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:30.960
and that's what the
collection includes.

00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:32.710
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: The
CD's that you put out?

00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:34.010
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Yeah.

00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:35.310
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So,
there were two of the CD's.

00:53:35.310 --> 00:53:38.920
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Yes, they were
-- both have the year 2000,

00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:41.790
Appleseed Records,
The Warner Collection,

00:53:41.790 --> 00:53:44.060
Volume 1 and Volume 2.

00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:48.310
We gave them names according
to songs that we loved.

00:53:48.310 --> 00:53:51.090
But, they're still
available on Appleseed label.

00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:52.390
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And
one of them is sort

00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:55.060
of a general overview of the
collection and the other focuses

00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:56.420
on Beech Mountain more or less?

00:53:56.420 --> 00:53:57.720
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Or,
North Carolina.

00:53:57.720 --> 00:53:59.230
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: North
Carolina, okay, yeah.

00:53:59.230 --> 00:54:00.750
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Yeah,
because it was the Outer Banks

00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:02.050
and Raleigh and --

00:54:02.050 --> 00:54:03.350
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Good point, yeah.

00:54:03.350 --> 00:54:04.650
All right.

00:54:04.650 --> 00:54:08.040
So, yeah, so that's the
way I think a lot of folks

00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:10.850
in the later part
of the revival came

00:54:10.850 --> 00:54:12.950
to realize how rich
the collection was --

00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:14.250
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Interesting.

00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:15.550
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Was
these two CD's came out.

00:54:15.550 --> 00:54:18.140
And, you know, Tim was kind of
young [inaudible] at that time

00:54:18.140 --> 00:54:19.470
that everyone was listening to.

00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:22.170
And, if he thought it was
good, people were going to --

00:54:22.170 --> 00:54:23.470
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: You
have a point.

00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:24.770
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Listen to it.

00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:26.070
So --

00:54:26.070 --> 00:54:27.370
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Yeah.

00:54:27.370 --> 00:54:28.670
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
So, that was a --

00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:29.970
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
Thank you, Tim.

00:54:29.970 --> 00:54:31.270
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
A great moment

00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:32.570
for that collection, as well.

00:54:32.570 --> 00:54:33.870
So, let's talk about
From the Mountains

00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:35.170
to the Sea a little bit, the
production that you're going

00:54:35.170 --> 00:54:36.470
to show for us tonight.

00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:38.950
But, how did you
put it together?

00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:41.650
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Well, Vic and
Tina Smith, who live in Sussex,

00:54:41.650 --> 00:54:46.660
England, had the worked
on several kind of shows,

00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:51.590
multimedia shows,
of English folklore.

00:54:51.590 --> 00:54:55.580
And, they decided that I should
do one on the Warner collection.

00:54:55.580 --> 00:54:58.170
There were very high
on it, and I knew them

00:54:58.170 --> 00:55:00.630
from their folklore in Sussex.

00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:02.560
And, so, they said
you must do this.

00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:03.880
You must write it.

00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:06.810
And I probably put
it off a year or two,

00:55:06.810 --> 00:55:08.370
and then finally
sat down and did it.

00:55:08.370 --> 00:55:14.520
So, it was 2009 or 2010 for one
of the English folk festivals.

00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:16.800
And then I did a couple
of times over there

00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:19.180
and then brought
it home to Gerret,

00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:20.920
who lives in Chapel
Hill, North Carolina.

00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:24.190
So, we're together a lot,
but we are 800 miles apart.

00:55:24.190 --> 00:55:27.890
And, we started looking at
all the great photographs

00:55:27.890 --> 00:55:32.010
that we have, plus Gerret's
great photographic eye,

00:55:32.010 --> 00:55:33.990
and so let's rewrite it.

00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:37.860
So, we put it together
with many more photographs,

00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:41.720
and then a real script
that was fine edited

00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:45.220
to match the picture
to the text.

00:55:45.220 --> 00:55:47.370
And then we put in
sound recordings

00:55:47.370 --> 00:55:49.030
of these rural people.

00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:52.420
And then, as an extra fill up,
I did some of the songs myself.

00:55:52.420 --> 00:55:53.720
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Sure.

00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:55.020
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: And,
as an extra fill up,

00:55:55.020 --> 00:55:56.510
we got the audience
to sing with us.

00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:59.630
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: So, the final
piece was, my wife, Mimi Gredy,

00:55:59.630 --> 00:56:01.120
runs the audio playback.

00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:05.480
So, she and I are the AV
tech team to his performance.

00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:07.960
She runs audio, I run picture.

00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:09.790
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Amazing.

00:56:09.790 --> 00:56:12.090
Well, there's one more thing
that I wanted to talk about,

00:56:12.090 --> 00:56:15.760
which I'll turn to our
props here a little bit.

00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:20.270
And, so, this is the book called
Traditional American Folk Songs

00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:23.210
from the Anne and Frank Warner
Collection, which your mother,

00:56:23.210 --> 00:56:25.870
Anne Warner, put
together, started doing it

00:56:25.870 --> 00:56:28.870
with your father, but he passed
away before it was completed.

00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:31.380
And it was just interesting to
us that we were all in the --

00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:34.310
in the folklife reading room
today and we looked at the book.

00:56:34.310 --> 00:56:36.410
And, there's something
about it that we [inaudible]

00:56:36.410 --> 00:56:38.030
because it has a dust
jacket on it when --

00:56:38.030 --> 00:56:39.330
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: That's true.

00:56:39.330 --> 00:56:40.870
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: It's
not on a library shelf.

00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:46.720
But, the actual cover of the
book has a little embossed banjo

00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:51.230
on it, and that turns us to
our next topic of conversation,

00:56:51.230 --> 00:56:53.340
which is, the Frank
Warner banjo.

00:56:53.340 --> 00:56:57.640
Because these two gentlemen,
Jeff and Gerret Warner,

00:56:57.640 --> 00:57:01.750
have been kind enough to consign
this banjo, to give this banjo,

00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:03.180
to the Library of Congress.

00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:07.020
And, so, we're going to show
the banjo and you can --

00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:08.320
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Great.

00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:09.620
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Talk
a little bit about it.

00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:10.920
So --

00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:12.220
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Yeah.

00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:13.520
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: This is a --

00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:14.820
this is a banjo that
Frank Warner owned

00:57:14.820 --> 00:57:16.120
for many, many years.

00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:17.420
It's the banjo that you
were talking about early

00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:18.720
on in our conversation.

00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:20.020
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Yeah.

00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:21.320
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
I'll sit down with it.

00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:25.370
And would you like to tell us
just a little bit about it?

00:57:25.370 --> 00:57:28.410
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: They -- our
folks went to Beech Mountain,

00:57:28.410 --> 00:57:31.980
Western North Carolina in 1938,
because of a mountain dulcimer.

00:57:31.980 --> 00:57:35.160
Nathan Hicks, Frank
Proffitt's father-in-law,

00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:39.780
had made this dulcimer for
Frank and Anne Warner in '38.

00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:41.490
And, when they went
to visit the folks

00:57:41.490 --> 00:57:45.240
on the Beech he saw an old banjo
and he wanted one of those,

00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:46.730
too, did Frank Warner.

00:57:46.730 --> 00:57:48.400
So, he asked Nathan
to make one of those.

00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:54.850
And, in 1939 he made this
banjo for Frank Warner.

00:57:54.850 --> 00:57:59.180
My father, we talked about Carl
Carmer, the New York author

00:57:59.180 --> 00:58:02.590
who was doing some
luncheon program in 1939,

00:58:02.590 --> 00:58:06.100
and asked Frank Warner to
come and illustrate some songs

00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:09.700
from John -- from the
-- from the north.

00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:12.240
And my father took the banjo,
went to sing some songs,

00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:15.210
and happened to be sitting
next to Carl Sandburg,

00:58:15.210 --> 00:58:17.510
the poet from Illinois.

00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:20.270
And, on a whim, Frank Warner
said to Carl Sandburg,

00:58:20.270 --> 00:58:22.240
would you sign this for me?

00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:23.540
So --

00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:24.840
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: This is
one of those great moments,

00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:26.280
because you wonder,
what was he thinking?

00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:27.580
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Yeah.

00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:29.070
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: You get a
new banjo from the mountains --

00:58:29.070 --> 00:58:30.370
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Who
signs the head?

00:58:30.370 --> 00:58:31.780
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Just,
yeah, sign my instrument.

00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:33.080
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: What?

00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:36.620
So, he signed it
Carl Sandberg 1939.

00:58:36.620 --> 00:58:40.180
And my father said,
after that it was easy

00:58:40.180 --> 00:58:41.480
to get other people sign it.

00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:42.780
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:44.390
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: So, John
Lomax and Alan Lomax

00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:46.300
and Pete Seeger and
Leadbelly and --

00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:47.890
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Two hundred
and fifty other people,

00:58:47.890 --> 00:58:52.320
Jean Ritchie and Woody
Guthrie and Odetta.

00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:54.670
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Whalen Hand
[phonetic] and, you know,

00:58:54.670 --> 00:58:56.030
professors of folk music.

00:58:56.030 --> 00:58:57.330
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:58:57.330 --> 00:58:58.630
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Joe Hickerson.

00:58:58.630 --> 00:58:59.930
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Right,
Joe Hickerson.

00:58:59.930 --> 00:59:01.230
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Most of the heads

00:59:01.230 --> 00:59:02.610
of the archive here have
signed it over the years.

00:59:02.610 --> 00:59:03.910
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Yeah,
[inaudible].

00:59:03.910 --> 00:59:05.420
So, it just went
on and on for --

00:59:05.420 --> 00:59:10.660
from 1939 to about '77 of
getting signatures of people

00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:13.390
in the folk revival
and folk academe,

00:59:13.390 --> 00:59:15.790
and it became quite an
artifact because of that,

00:59:15.790 --> 00:59:17.790
and my father used
it all the time.

00:59:17.790 --> 00:59:20.620
He didn't know how to
play a five-string banjo,

00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:21.980
so he took off --

00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:23.280
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Yeah.

00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:24.580
He played a four-string guitar.

00:59:24.580 --> 00:59:25.950
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Yeah,
a tenor guitar.

00:59:25.950 --> 00:59:27.450
So, he took off the fifth peg --

00:59:27.450 --> 00:59:28.750
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Got
you, he took off --

00:59:28.750 --> 00:59:32.050
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: And had it
restrung as a tenor, as a --

00:59:32.050 --> 00:59:33.350
yeah, four-string guitar.

00:59:33.350 --> 00:59:34.650
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:59:34.650 --> 00:59:35.950
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
But, it's interesting.

00:59:35.950 --> 00:59:37.250
I mean, it spans the
whole spread of folklore,

00:59:37.250 --> 00:59:40.160
you might say, from
the most academic to --

00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:41.460
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:59:41.460 --> 00:59:42.760
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Just people
that he met along the way.

00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:45.360
Jesse Merritt was a
historian of Nassau County

00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:48.480
in Long Island, he signed it.

00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:49.780
That's great.

00:59:49.780 --> 00:59:51.080
I mean, it's got a --
it's got a great sort

00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:53.660
of Carl Sandburg-like
celebration circle,

00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:57.350
like celebration of
American humanity.

00:59:57.350 --> 00:59:58.650
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Yeah, and there's a --

00:59:58.650 --> 00:59:59.950
there's a picture
of it in the book.

00:59:59.950 --> 01:00:03.170
So, it's documented in
various ways over the years,

01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:07.390
but it's just great to have
this item in the library,

01:00:07.390 --> 01:00:10.770
both for the signatures on
it, but for what it represents

01:00:10.770 --> 01:00:14.790
about Frank and about
the collection as well.

01:00:14.790 --> 01:00:17.110
And, also, there's a
relationship between this

01:00:17.110 --> 01:00:19.400
and another banjo that we
have, because we have a banjo

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:21.870
that was made by Frank Proffitt,

01:00:21.870 --> 01:00:24.340
and Nathan was his
father-in-law,

01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:26.750
and I believe Nathan
was also instrumental

01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:29.410
in teaching him something
about making banjos.

01:00:29.410 --> 01:00:30.710
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Could be.

01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:32.010
I don't know.

01:00:32.010 --> 01:00:33.310
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And, so --

01:00:33.310 --> 01:00:34.610
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: We don't know.

01:00:34.610 --> 01:00:35.910
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: But,
Frank Proffitt learned

01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:37.210
from his father, as well.

01:00:37.210 --> 01:00:38.510
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah,
so, there we have it.

01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:39.810
Two similar banjos made
in the same style from --

01:00:39.810 --> 01:00:41.110
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Right,
pretty close together.

01:00:41.110 --> 01:00:42.410
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Pretty
close together, yeah.

01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:44.220
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: We're
really proud to make it yours.

01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:45.800
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah, well,
and we're proud to have it.

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:47.980
So, thank you, gentlemen,
both very much.

01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:51.330
And I'd like to say thank you
for the interview as well.

01:00:51.330 --> 01:00:54.100
We're really looking forward
to the performance tonight,

01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:58.250
and to keeping both
what you've said today

01:00:58.250 --> 01:01:01.530
and what you will perform
for us tonight safe here

01:01:01.530 --> 01:01:02.830
in the Library of Congress.

01:01:02.830 --> 01:01:04.130
So, thank you very much.

01:01:04.130 --> 01:01:06.520
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
Thanks so much.

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:10.200
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:11.970
