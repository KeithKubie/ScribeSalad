00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:01.700
 Hi Internet 

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.828
 We heard you were angry at Joanna. 

00:00:03.828 --> 00:00:04.870
 Wait, what? 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.590
 Your video toolbar does not cover all roaming methods in the app 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:08.510
 What about that? 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.650
 I will tell you. wait. I only had two minutes, 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.735
 The Internet is very slow. 

00:00:12.735 --> 00:00:16.610
 Wait, wait. Do not leave. There is nothing wrong. It's important. We will go beyond it. 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.546
 We just have to talk about browsing the appBar appBar and Toolbars 

00:00:19.575 --> 00:00:21.752
 Okay. If we scroll on the scrollFlags . 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.750
 It's not just scrollFlags . 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.917
 We have to talk about the whole subject. 

00:00:26.197 --> 00:00:27.155
 Funny fact. 

00:00:27.155 --> 00:00:30.590
 In fact, AppBar is just an ActionBar with a fancy name. 

00:00:30.621 --> 00:00:32.659
 Well, it's not just a new fancy name. 

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:34.860
 It is the basis for your entire application. 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.610
 If true 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.359
 Do not think they should call him AnchorBar 

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:40.140
 The AnchorBar looks ridiculous 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.640
 The Android system has nothing ridiculous. 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.020
 of course not. 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.220
 But in any case, you can customize AppBar 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.580
 If you choose to use a toolbar instead of choosing a traditional frame structure. 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.180
 - Thanks, Ian. - you are welcome. 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.116
 - As I explained in DevByte - this really is good. You have to watch it. 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.710
 Thanks Ian. 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.650
 But it really does not answer the question of where the scroll feature lies? 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.790
 Well, but it's an AppBar model of course. 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.940
 But you are right. I still have not talked about the usefulness of scrolling. 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.950
 You are probably right that you have to talk about him 

00:01:06.976 --> 00:01:07.722
 It is important. 

00:01:07.722 --> 00:01:08.430
 Okay. 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.433
 So I was-- 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.070
 If you want the tools to pass with a click 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.590
 To help you put content in a great way 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.860
 By hiding Chrome from your app? Yup. Okay. 

00:01:20.037 --> 00:01:21.870
 If you decide to use AppBar, 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.200
 You'll need three things. 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.140
 The first thing is a coordinated outward appearance above. 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.630
 - Thanks Ian. - Not to thank on duty. 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.230
 You will then need the AppBar layout that contains the toolbar. 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.720
 - Thanks Ian. - Not to thank on duty. 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.158
 Then you will finally need 

00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:34.810
 To original content such as RecycleView . 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.579
 - Thanks Ian. - Not to thank on duty. 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.630
 Now if you forgot to specify the external appearance style 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.740
 Your application will deteriorate and will not prove. 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.067
 So do not forget him. 

00:01:43.067 --> 00:01:45.150
 Finally scrollFlags attribute 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.944
 Is the magic that will allow the application to work. 

00:01:46.944 --> 00:01:49.580
 - Deterioration? Is this really a word? - Yup 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.000
 - I do not see it - I learn? If it was not a word I would not use it. 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.311
 I believe her. 

00:01:55.311 --> 00:01:57.560
 So what do these scrollFlags do for your application? 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.340
 Well, the scrolling process 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.790
 I assure you that everything will pass on the screen. 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.650
 And enterAlways assures that it will rotate as soon as you re-scroll. 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.210
 Wonderful 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.169
 Quick style. 

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:10.668
 It is indeed a common pattern. 

00:02:10.668 --> 00:02:11.740
 Specifically. 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.570
 So we hope this has helped you-- 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.640
 In understanding the process, developers. 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.830
 - Thanks Ian. - no problem. 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.940
 So go make better apps 

00:02:19.951 --> 00:02:20.970
 Stop. Stop. 

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.880
 Done well 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.280
 I created the best apps!
