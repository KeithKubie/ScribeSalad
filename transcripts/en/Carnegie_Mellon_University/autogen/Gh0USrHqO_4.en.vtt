very hard in love with football and

00:18:57.810 --> 00:18:57.820
very hard in love with football and
 

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:00.120
very hard in love with football and
hockey um and this is again an example

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:00.130
hockey um and this is again an example
 

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:02.100
hockey um and this is again an example
of what CM you can do to you not the

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:02.110
of what CM you can do to you not the
 

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:04.230
of what CM you can do to you not the
football part but the fact that you know

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:04.240
football part but the fact that you know
 

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.240
football part but the fact that you know
you can pursue your own interests and

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:06.250
you can pursue your own interests and
 

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:08.399
you can pursue your own interests and
you can pursue interdisciplinary things

00:19:08.399 --> 00:19:08.409
you can pursue interdisciplinary things
 

00:19:08.409 --> 00:19:10.470
you can pursue interdisciplinary things
so once i started watching football I

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480
so once i started watching football I
 

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.480
so once i started watching football I
would throw things at the TV when a call

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:12.490
would throw things at the TV when a call
 

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:14.850
would throw things at the TV when a call
then go the Steelers way and you start

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:14.860
then go the Steelers way and you start
 

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:16.110
then go the Steelers way and you start
thinking this is a problem this is a

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:16.120
thinking this is a problem this is a
 

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.430
thinking this is a problem this is a
real problem for me at least it's a

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.440
real problem for me at least it's a
 

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.409
real problem for me at least it's a
genuine problem right and how do you go

00:19:19.409 --> 00:19:19.419
genuine problem right and how do you go
 

00:19:19.419 --> 00:19:20.850
genuine problem right and how do you go
about solving that problem and i teach

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:20.860
about solving that problem and i teach
 

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:22.769
about solving that problem and i teach
embedded systems for a living so you

00:19:22.769 --> 00:19:22.779
embedded systems for a living so you
 

00:19:22.779 --> 00:19:24.120
embedded systems for a living so you
start to think how do you put these two

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:24.130
start to think how do you put these two
 

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:26.460
start to think how do you put these two
things together and so immediately the

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:26.470
things together and so immediately the
 

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:27.720
things together and so immediately the
idea comes you know why don't you put a

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:27.730
idea comes you know why don't you put a
 

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:29.340
idea comes you know why don't you put a
chip in the football so you can tell

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:29.350
chip in the football so you can tell
 

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:30.659
chip in the football so you can tell
where the football lands fourth and

00:19:30.659 --> 00:19:30.669
where the football lands fourth and
 

00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:32.370
where the football lands fourth and
inches versus the first time so we went

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:32.380
inches versus the first time so we went
 

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:34.500
inches versus the first time so we went
down that path and started doing exactly

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:34.510
down that path and started doing exactly
 

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:35.909
down that path and started doing exactly
those kinds of projects for the last

00:19:35.909 --> 00:19:35.919
those kinds of projects for the last
 

00:19:35.919 --> 00:19:38.070
those kinds of projects for the last
three four years and as much fun as it

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:38.080
three four years and as much fun as it
 

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.049
three four years and as much fun as it
sounds it's really really really hard

00:19:40.049 --> 00:19:40.059
sounds it's really really really hard
 

00:19:40.059 --> 00:19:42.899
sounds it's really really really hard
and the reason it's hard is most of the

00:19:42.899 --> 00:19:42.909
and the reason it's hard is most of the
 

00:19:42.909 --> 00:19:44.639
and the reason it's hard is most of the
technologies out there in the networking

00:19:44.639 --> 00:19:44.649
technologies out there in the networking
 

00:19:44.649 --> 00:19:46.260
technologies out there in the networking
industry or the wireless industry for

industry or the wireless industry for
 

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:48.120
industry or the wireless industry for
doing localization which means how do

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:48.130
doing localization which means how do
 

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:48.950
doing localization which means how do
you know where

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:48.960
you know where
 

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.950
you know where
something is are within feet range yards

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:51.960
something is are within feet range yards

nothing is as more as demanding as that

00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:56.700
nothing is as more as demanding as that
 

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.490
nothing is as more as demanding as that
in terms of you've got to localize the

00:19:58.490 --> 00:19:58.500
in terms of you've got to localize the
 

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.560
in terms of you've got to localize the
ball and here's where it gets even more

you've got to be able to make that
 

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.330
you've got to be able to make that
decision that the ball actually landed

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:11.340

things like that you know we put I mean
 

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:29.450
things like that you know we put I mean
we put sensors into anything that moves

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:29.460
we put sensors into anything that moves
 

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.130
we put sensors into anything that moves
and we put it that way we put it into

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:31.140
and we put it that way we put it into

do you know whether the guy wobbled the

00:20:41.389 --> 00:20:41.399
do you know whether the guy wobbled the
 

00:20:41.399 --> 00:20:42.740
do you know whether the guy wobbled the
ball again one of those things that I

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:42.750
ball again one of those things that I
 

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:44.510
ball again one of those things that I
you know I get really mad about and

put sensors into gloves so we know
 

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.370
put sensors into gloves so we know
whether he's wobbled the ball with a yes

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:49.380
whether he's wobbled the ball with a yes
 

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:51.980
whether he's wobbled the ball with a yes
possession of it control put things into

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:51.990
possession of it control put things into
 

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:53.960

shoes so we can help a punt kick or kick

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:53.970
shoes so we can help a punt kick or kick
 

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:55.639
shoes so we can help a punt kick or kick
better because again we also think about

00:20:55.639 --> 00:20:55.649
better because again we also think about
 

00:20:55.649 --> 00:20:57.560
better because again we also think about
high school players and junior players

00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:57.570
high school players and junior players
 

00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:59.090
high school players and junior players
right i mean they're a lot of kids want

00:20:59.090 --> 00:20:59.100
right i mean they're a lot of kids want
 

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:00.529
right i mean they're a lot of kids want
to go out and become the best punt kick

00:21:00.529 --> 00:21:00.539
to go out and become the best punt kick
 

00:21:00.539 --> 00:21:01.880
to go out and become the best punt kick
her out there but they can't afford to

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:01.890
her out there but they can't afford to
 

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:03.799
her out there but they can't afford to
hire the coaches to do it but if they

00:21:03.799 --> 00:21:03.809
hire the coaches to do it but if they
 

00:21:03.809 --> 00:21:04.909
hire the coaches to do it but if they
could actually get the data

00:21:04.909 --> 00:21:04.919
could actually get the data
 

00:21:04.919 --> 00:21:06.440
could actually get the data
independently and know how good they are

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:06.450
independently and know how good they are
 

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:07.789
independently and know how good they are
they can make that decision and take

00:21:07.789 --> 00:21:07.799
they can make that decision and take
 

00:21:07.799 --> 00:21:09.380
they can make that decision and take
that data to the coach right so we've

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:09.390
that data to the coach right so we've
 

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:10.970
that data to the coach right so we've
looked at things like that and then

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:10.980
looked at things like that and then
 

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:13.220
looked at things like that and then
again following my love for sports more

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:13.230
again following my love for sports more
 

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:16.100
again following my love for sports more

got cheap nosebleed seats I still get

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:19.830
got cheap nosebleed seats I still get
 

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:22.460
got cheap nosebleed seats I still get
cheap nosebleed seats and when i'm going

cheap nosebleed seats and when i'm going
 

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:24.019
cheap nosebleed seats and when i'm going
to cheap nosebleed seat i mean all of

you can see how tall I am when I stand

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:25.830
you can see how tall I am when I stand
 

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:27.799
you can see how tall I am when I stand
up I'm not so far and there's always a

00:21:27.799 --> 00:21:27.809
up I'm not so far and there's always a
 

00:21:27.809 --> 00:21:29.330
up I'm not so far and there's always a
tall guy in front of me who stands up

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:29.340
tall guy in front of me who stands up
 

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:31.220
tall guy in front of me who stands up
and cuts my view of the goal off then

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:31.230
and cuts my view of the goal off then
 

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:32.930
and cuts my view of the goal off then
the jumbotron guy decides how I should

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:32.940
the jumbotron guy decides how I should
 

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:34.399
the jumbotron guy decides how I should
see a replay I think these things are

00:21:34.399 --> 00:21:34.409
see a replay I think these things are
 

00:21:34.409 --> 00:21:36.260
see a replay I think these things are
unfair right and again you've got to

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:36.270
unfair right and again you've got to
 

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:38.330
unfair right and again you've got to
decide how you take technology and try

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:38.340
decide how you take technology and try
 

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.039
decide how you take technology and try
to solve that problem and again we

00:21:40.039 --> 00:21:40.049
to solve that problem and again we
 

00:21:40.049 --> 00:21:41.120
to solve that problem and again we
started thinking how do you solve that

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:41.130
started thinking how do you solve that
 

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:43.070
started thinking how do you solve that
problem will let everyone have their own

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:43.080
problem will let everyone have their own
 

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.110
problem will let everyone have their own
personal broadcast let everyone decide

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.120
personal broadcast let everyone decide
 

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.850
personal broadcast let everyone decide
how they should see a replay which angle

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:46.860
how they should see a replay which angle
 

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:48.620
how they should see a replay which angle
they want to watch it let them see the

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:48.630
they want to watch it let them see the
 

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:50.299
they want to watch it let them see the

00:21:50.299 --> 00:21:50.309
sweat on the players face if they want
 

00:21:50.309 --> 00:21:51.680
sweat on the players face if they want
to see it why should only the jumbotron

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:51.690
to see it why should only the jumbotron
 

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:53.600
to see it why should only the jumbotron
guys here right and so we started

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:53.610
guys here right and so we started
 

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:54.769

certainly the issues of connectedness

00:36:15.539 --> 00:36:15.549
certainly the issues of connectedness
 

00:36:15.549 --> 00:36:17.370
certainly the issues of connectedness
and a lot of that connect and this is

00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:17.380
and a lot of that connect and this is
 

00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:20.729
and a lot of that connect and this is
going to come through through mobile

00:36:20.729 --> 00:36:20.739
going to come through through mobile
 

00:36:20.739 --> 00:36:22.829
going to come through through mobile
technologies and specifically I think a

through disposable technologies we're
 

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.249
through disposable technologies we're
going to end up in situations very soon

00:36:29.249 --> 00:36:29.259
going to end up in situations very soon
 

00:36:29.259 --> 00:36:31.309

its normal places in kind of weaving
itself through all the parts of our

00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:08.200
itself through all the parts of our
 

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:14.130

lives great um so I think as an

00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:14.140
lives great um so I think as an
 

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:15.390
lives great um so I think as an
extension of some of the things that

00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:15.400
extension of some of the things that
 

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:16.740
extension of some of the things that
I've said and also some of the things

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:16.750
I've said and also some of the things
 

00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:20.250
I've said and also some of the things
that you've heard on the panel you've

00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:20.260
that you've heard on the panel you've
 

00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:21.960
that you've heard on the panel you've
seen over the last maybe three four

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:21.970
seen over the last maybe three four
 

00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:24.120
seen over the last maybe three four
years this thing called cloud computing

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:24.130
years this thing called cloud computing
 

00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:26.579
years this thing called cloud computing
and data centers take off but if you

00:38:26.579 --> 00:38:26.589
and data centers take off but if you
 

00:38:26.589 --> 00:38:28.200
and data centers take off but if you
look at it on mobile phones mobile

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:28.210
look at it on mobile phones mobile
 

00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:30.059
look at it on mobile phones mobile
phones are growing larger there should

00:38:30.059 --> 00:38:30.069
phones are growing larger there should
 

00:38:30.069 --> 00:38:32.789
phones are growing larger there should
be a day when you know you can

00:38:32.789 --> 00:38:32.799
be a day when you know you can
 

00:38:32.799 --> 00:38:34.859
be a day when you know you can
essentially create a virtual data center

00:38:34.859 --> 00:38:34.869
essentially create a virtual data center
 

00:38:34.869 --> 00:38:36.480
essentially create a virtual data center
of all the phones you and your friends

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:36.490
of all the phones you and your friends
 

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:38.280
of all the phones you and your friends
have access to that would be really cool

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:38.290
have access to that would be really cool
 

00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:40.859
have access to that would be really cool
if in fact all of your data all the bits

00:38:40.859 --> 00:38:40.869
if in fact all of your data all the bits
 

00:38:40.869 --> 00:38:42.720
if in fact all of your data all the bits
in your life was stored on some mobile

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:42.730
in your life was stored on some mobile
 

00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:44.400
in your life was stored on some mobile
device and obviously that you know you

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:44.410
device and obviously that you know you
 

00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:46.770

need those are the high bandwidth you

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:46.780
need those are the high bandwidth you
 

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:48.660
need those are the high bandwidth you
know multimedia intensive applications

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:48.670

right so 11 concrete way then that you

00:38:54.809 --> 00:38:54.819
right so 11 concrete way then that you
 

00:38:54.819 --> 00:38:56.579
right so 11 concrete way then that you
could exploit that is think about the

00:38:56.579 --> 00:38:56.589
could exploit that is think about the
 

00:38:56.589 --> 00:38:58.109
could exploit that is think about the
guy who's right up there next to the

guy who's right up there next to the
 

00:38:58.119 --> 00:39:02.039

face smash up against the glass better
 

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:05.490
face smash up against the glass better
than anybody else he can see that fight

better than anybody else there's no
 

00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:09.329
better than anybody else there's no
camera down there right but if you could

00:39:09.329 --> 00:39:09.339
camera down there right but if you could
 

00:39:09.339 --> 00:39:11.640
camera down there right but if you could
co-opt the phone of the guy who's

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:11.650
co-opt the phone of the guy who's
 

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:13.500
co-opt the phone of the guy who's
sitting right there who has that premium

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:13.510
sitting right there who has that premium

you've got something cool but you can't

00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:26.200
you've got something cool but you can't
 

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:28.200
you've got something cool but you can't
really do that today because you don't

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:28.210
really do that today because you don't
 

00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:30.150
really do that today because you don't
have the network fabric to support that

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:30.160
have the network fabric to support that

bandwidth intensive application you can
do some things like mobile streaming

00:39:35.579 --> 00:39:35.589
do some things like mobile streaming

video indoors we've done it for

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:37.210
video indoors we've done it for
 

00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:39.029
video indoors we've done it for
thousands of people but we can't yet do

00:39:39.029 --> 00:39:39.039
thousands of people but we can't yet do
 

00:39:39.039 --> 00:39:41.309
thousands of people but we can't yet do
that we can't yet create a mobile data

00:39:41.309 --> 00:39:41.319
that we can't yet create a mobile data
 

00:39:41.319 --> 00:39:43.140
that we can't yet create a mobile data
center just out of phones going back

00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:43.150
center just out of phones going back
 

00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:45.390
center just out of phones going back
again to the example and Haiti right if

00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:45.400
again to the example and Haiti right if
 

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:46.769
again to the example and Haiti right if
you could just take the phones of all

00:39:46.769 --> 00:39:46.779
you could just take the phones of all
 

00:39:46.779 --> 00:39:48.240
you could just take the phones of all
the people there and create a virtual

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:48.250
the people there and create a virtual
 

00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:49.620
the people there and create a virtual
data center that allowed them to share

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:49.630
data center that allowed them to share
 

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:51.870
data center that allowed them to share
information on the fly creating a data

00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:51.880
information on the fly creating a data
 

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:54.000
information on the fly creating a data
center essentially on the fly creating a

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:54.010
center essentially on the fly creating a
 

00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:55.440
center essentially on the fly creating a
mobile cloud computing environment that

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:55.450
mobile cloud computing environment that
 

00:39:55.450 --> 00:39:56.849
mobile cloud computing environment that
would be cool that's something we're

00:39:56.849 --> 00:39:56.859
would be cool that's something we're
 

00:39:56.859 --> 00:39:59.670
would be cool that's something we're
working on already at CMU across our

00:39:59.670 --> 00:39:59.680
working on already at CMU across our
 

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:01.380
working on already at CMU across our
campus testbed we've deployed a number

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:01.390
campus testbed we've deployed a number
 

00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:03.180
campus testbed we've deployed a number
of phones that we're hoping will turn

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:03.190
of phones that we're hoping will turn
 

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:04.680
of phones that we're hoping will turn
into one of those kinds of mobile cloud

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:04.690
into one of those kinds of mobile cloud
 

00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:06.539
into one of those kinds of mobile cloud
computing centers that we will then

00:40:06.539 --> 00:40:06.549
computing centers that we will then
 

00:40:06.549 --> 00:40:08.069
computing centers that we will then
actually try to deploy in a real life

00:40:08.069 --> 00:40:08.079
actually try to deploy in a real life
 

00:40:08.079 --> 00:40:09.779
actually try to deploy in a real life
stadium and we want to see what the

00:40:09.779 --> 00:40:09.789
stadium and we want to see what the
 

00:40:09.789 --> 00:40:11.490
stadium and we want to see what the
effects of that would be but again I

00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:11.500
effects of that would be but again I
 

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:15.140
effects of that would be but again I
think that's a that's a huge trend I

00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:15.150
think that's a that's a huge trend I
 

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:17.569
think that's a that's a huge trend I
don't know what to follow with that

00:40:17.569 --> 00:40:17.579
don't know what to follow with that
 

00:40:17.579 --> 00:40:20.099
don't know what to follow with that
because I actually was thinking about

00:40:20.099 --> 00:40:20.109
because I actually was thinking about
 

00:40:20.109 --> 00:40:24.720
because I actually was thinking about
the cloud computing hadn't quite gone to

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:24.730
the cloud computing hadn't quite gone to
 

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:28.859
the cloud computing hadn't quite gone to
the face against the glass but um this

00:40:28.859 --> 00:40:28.869
the face against the glass but um this
 

00:40:28.869 --> 00:40:30.809
the face against the glass but um this
is mu so they go there before you do

00:40:30.809 --> 00:40:30.819
is mu so they go there before you do
 

00:40:30.819 --> 00:40:34.880
is mu so they go there before you do
right so I I definitely think that

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:34.890
right so I I definitely think that
 

00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:38.789
right so I I definitely think that
wireless capacity everybody's putting a

00:40:38.789 --> 00:40:38.799
wireless capacity everybody's putting a
 

00:40:38.799 --> 00:40:44.430
wireless capacity everybody's putting a
chip in everything and the more we do

00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:44.440
chip in everything and the more we do
 

00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:47.130
chip in everything and the more we do
that and it's really about enhancing our

00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:47.140
that and it's really about enhancing our
 

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:49.500
that and it's really about enhancing our
lives and for some of those for some of

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:49.510
lives and for some of those for some of
 

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:50.970
lives and for some of those for some of
us it's an enhancement some of us is

00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:50.980
us it's an enhancement some of us is
 

00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:52.440
us it's an enhancement some of us is
people can find us where we are and

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:52.450
people can find us where we are and
 

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:55.010
people can find us where we are and
we're not sure that's enhancing it right

00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:55.020
we're not sure that's enhancing it right
 

00:40:55.020 --> 00:41:00.240
we're not sure that's enhancing it right
but how do you get people what they need

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:00.250
but how do you get people what they need
 

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:02.880
but how do you get people what they need
whatever they are whether you're talking

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:02.890
whatever they are whether you're talking
 

00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:08.039
whatever they are whether you're talking
mobile cloud computing or getting

00:41:08.039 --> 00:41:08.049
mobile cloud computing or getting
 

00:41:08.049 --> 00:41:09.930
mobile cloud computing or getting
information to customers I think it's

00:41:09.930 --> 00:41:09.940
information to customers I think it's
 

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:11.819
information to customers I think it's
it's a speed how do you build an

00:41:11.819 --> 00:41:11.829
it's a speed how do you build an
 

00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:13.230
it's a speed how do you build an
infrastructure how do you build the

00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:13.240
infrastructure how do you build the
 

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:15.660
infrastructure how do you build the
software how do you build the

00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:15.670
software how do you build the
 

00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:18.120
software how do you build the
applications that are going to enable

00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:18.130
applications that are going to enable
 

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:20.400
applications that are going to enable
and so sex that you have open interfaces

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:20.410
and so sex that you have open interfaces
 

00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:21.809
and so sex that you have open interfaces
because that's one of the challenges

00:41:21.809 --> 00:41:21.819
because that's one of the challenges
 

00:41:21.819 --> 00:41:25.490
because that's one of the challenges
that we have in a competitive I

00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:25.500
that we have in a competitive I
 

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:28.610
that we have in a competitive I
met you you want both open but you still

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:28.620
met you you want both open but you still
 

00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:31.130
met you you want both open but you still
want your competitive edge right so how

00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:31.140
want your competitive edge right so how
 

00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:33.500
want your competitive edge right so how
do you leverage that for the customers

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:33.510
do you leverage that for the customers
 

00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:35.210
do you leverage that for the customers
yet still make it a profitable business

00:45:33.370 --> 00:45:33.380
application for the cell phones one of
 

00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:37.120
application for the cell phones one of
the breakthrough applications would be

00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:37.130
the breakthrough applications would be
 

00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:39.640

and that can be done in X and we are

00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:53.240
and that can be done in X and we are
 

00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:55.990
and that can be done in X and we are
also working on that in the next few

00:45:55.990 --> 00:45:56.000
also working on that in the next few
 

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.020

their system in Europe big point is

00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:02.770
their system in Europe big point is
 

00:50:02.770 --> 00:50:06.630
their system in Europe big point is
Germany's you know a company doing this

00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:06.640
Germany's you know a company doing this
 

00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:08.310
Germany's you know a company doing this
they have and they're having a much

00:50:08.310 --> 00:50:08.320
they have and they're having a much
 

00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:09.960
they have and they're having a much
easier time but big point is having a

00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:09.970
easier time but big point is having a
 

00:50:09.970 --> 00:50:13.380
easier time but big point is having a
hard time coming to the US because the

00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:13.390
hard time coming to the US because the
 

00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:16.410
hard time coming to the US because the
the cell phone companies here refused to

00:50:16.410 --> 00:50:16.420
the cell phone companies here refused to
 

00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:19.320
the cell phone companies here refused to
support micro pendants and I just I

00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:19.330
support micro pendants and I just I
 

00:50:19.330 --> 00:50:20.730
support micro pendants and I just I
don't understand it it's like they were

00:50:20.730 --> 00:50:20.740
don't understand it it's like they were
 

00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:22.859
don't understand it it's like they were
allergic to money or something and I

00:50:22.859 --> 00:50:22.869
allergic to money or something and I
 

00:50:22.869 --> 00:50:24.300
allergic to money or something and I
have not yet found anyone who

00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:24.310
have not yet found anyone who
 

00:50:24.310 --> 00:50:26.160
have not yet found anyone who
understands an explanation of why Europe

00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:26.170
understands an explanation of why Europe
 

00:50:26.170 --> 00:50:28.500
understands an explanation of why Europe
and Asia have this down but we don't

00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:28.510
and Asia have this down but we don't
 

00:50:28.510 --> 00:50:30.900
and Asia have this down but we don't
have here we have to do with different

00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:30.910
have here we have to do with different
 

00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:32.910
have here we have to do with different
banking rules so it would be an

00:50:32.910 --> 00:50:32.920
banking rules so it would be an
 

00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:34.230
banking rules so it would be an
interesting question yeah take a look at

00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:34.240
interesting question yeah take a look at
 

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:35.190
interesting question yeah take a look at
I don't know I don't know if it's a

00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:35.200
I don't know I don't know if it's a
 

00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:37.829
I don't know I don't know if it's a
legal thing or a culture thing it's it's

00:50:37.829 --> 00:50:37.839
legal thing or a culture thing it's it's
 

00:50:37.839 --> 00:50:42.800
legal thing or a culture thing it's it's
a mystery to me

00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:42.810
 
 

00:50:42.810 --> 00:50:46.050
 
so but you were asking what the payment

00:50:46.050 --> 00:50:46.060
so but you were asking what the payment
 

00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:47.490
so but you were asking what the payment
protocol will be and the answer is I

00:50:47.490 --> 00:50:47.500
protocol will be and the answer is I
 

00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:49.530
protocol will be and the answer is I
don't know but maybe it'll come out of

00:50:49.530 --> 00:50:49.540
don't know but maybe it'll come out of
 

00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:51.930
don't know but maybe it'll come out of
Europe and now that I look out of I mi

00:50:51.930 --> 00:50:51.940
Europe and now that I look out of I mi
 

00:50:51.940 --> 00:51:04.250
Europe and now that I look out of I mi
athens instead of my and I Pittsburgh I

00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:04.260
 
 

00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:10.440
 
I don't know but that may be the next

00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:10.450
I don't know but that may be the next
 

00:51:10.450 --> 00:51:15.060
I don't know but that may be the next
question we should be looking at my

00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:15.070
question we should be looking at my
 

00:51:15.070 --> 00:51:38.330
question we should be looking at my
stuff we talked about midnight

00:51:38.330 --> 00:51:38.340
 
 

00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:42.970

it's got to change the way they think
 

00:52:04.010 --> 00:52:06.400
it's got to change the way they think
about interacting and it's a very

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:06.410
about interacting and it's a very
 

00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:08.770
about interacting and it's a very
different connecting model when you

00:52:08.770 --> 00:52:08.780
different connecting model when you
 

00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:12.540
different connecting model when you
start looking at that generation right

00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:12.550
start looking at that generation right
 

00:52:12.550 --> 00:52:16.210
start looking at that generation right
so what I think I had to get a job

00:52:16.210 --> 00:52:16.220
so what I think I had to get a job
 

00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:18.849
so what I think I had to get a job
before I got a cell phone but they don't

00:52:18.849 --> 00:52:18.859
before I got a cell phone but they don't

just nervous for the day they start

00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:34.550
just nervous for the day they start
 

00:52:34.550 --> 00:52:35.890
just nervous for the day they start
sending video that way that's going to

00:52:35.890 --> 00:52:35.900
sending video that way that's going to
 

00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:38.200
sending video that way that's going to
drive the network bananas right oh you

00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:38.210
drive the network bananas right oh you
 

00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:41.349
drive the network bananas right oh you
got into it don't be then what are you

00:52:41.349 --> 00:52:41.359
got into it don't be then what are you
 

00:52:41.359 --> 00:52:43.930
got into it don't be then what are you
worried about I'm enjoying but there's a

00:52:43.930 --> 00:52:43.940
worried about I'm enjoying but there's a
 

00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:46.120
worried about I'm enjoying but there's a
cost to doing it and you got to get

00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:46.130
cost to doing it and you got to get
 

00:52:46.130 --> 00:52:48.340
cost to doing it and you got to get
ahead of that curve right so hopefully I

00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:48.350
ahead of that curve right so hopefully I
 

00:52:48.350 --> 00:52:50.530
ahead of that curve right so hopefully I
don't do it for 4g 4g shows up we will

00:52:50.530 --> 00:52:50.540
don't do it for 4g 4g shows up we will
 

00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:52.450
don't do it for 4g 4g shows up we will
see so sorry at that kind of volume

00:52:52.450 --> 00:52:52.460
see so sorry at that kind of volume
 

00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:55.900
see so sorry at that kind of volume
right it's a very different model in the

00:52:55.900 --> 00:52:55.910
right it's a very different model in the
 

00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:58.120
right it's a very different model in the
access that the information that they

00:52:58.120 --> 00:52:58.130
access that the information that they
 

00:52:58.130 --> 00:53:00.640
access that the information that they
have access to also drives different

00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:00.650
have access to also drives different
 

00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:04.599
have access to also drives different
behavior and they're not even when like

00:53:04.599 --> 00:53:04.609
behavior and they're not even when like
 

00:53:04.609 --> 00:53:06.130
behavior and they're not even when like
you know we have people that were

00:53:06.130 --> 00:53:06.140
you know we have people that were
 

00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:07.930
you know we have people that were
sitting in front of laptops or you know

00:53:07.930 --> 00:53:07.940
sitting in front of laptops or you know
 

00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:09.220
sitting in front of laptops or you know
in front of their computer doing work

00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:09.230
in front of their computer doing work
 

00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:11.170
in front of their computer doing work
they're doing this gaming and from

00:53:11.170 --> 00:53:11.180
they're doing this gaming and from
 

00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:13.240
they're doing this gaming and from
handheld devices and so it's going to be

00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:13.250
handheld devices and so it's going to be
 

00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:16.260
handheld devices and so it's going to be
a very different connection model that

00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:16.270
a very different connection model that
 

00:53:16.270 --> 00:53:20.830
a very different connection model that
from a from a teaching perspective they

00:53:20.830 --> 00:53:20.840
from a from a teaching perspective they
 

00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:23.020
from a from a teaching perspective they
wanted I think need to understand the

00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:23.030
wanted I think need to understand the
 

00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:25.090
wanted I think need to understand the
technology there really are no limits to

00:53:25.090 --> 00:53:25.100
technology there really are no limits to
 

00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:26.650
technology there really are no limits to
where they're going to go we just got to

00:53:26.650 --> 00:53:26.660
where they're going to go we just got to
 

00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:28.450
where they're going to go we just got to
figure out now how to build the

00:53:28.450 --> 00:53:28.460
figure out now how to build the
 

00:53:28.460 --> 00:53:31.000
figure out now how to build the
infrastructure to enable them to do what

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:31.010
infrastructure to enable them to do what
 

00:53:31.010 --> 00:53:32.230
infrastructure to enable them to do what
they're going to be asking to do 10

00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:32.240
they're going to be asking to do 10
 

00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:35.530
they're going to be asking to do 10
years from now it's a new culture and

00:53:35.530 --> 00:53:35.540
years from now it's a new culture and
 

00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:38.050
years from now it's a new culture and
all that social networking and use of

00:53:38.050 --> 00:53:38.060
all that social networking and use of
 

00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:40.810
all that social networking and use of
technology is clearly changing their

00:53:40.810 --> 00:53:40.820
technology is clearly changing their
 

00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:42.730
technology is clearly changing their
life as I said earlier cell phones are

00:53:42.730 --> 00:53:42.740
life as I said earlier cell phones are
 

00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:44.260
life as I said earlier cell phones are
wearable computers there are computers

00:53:44.260 --> 00:53:44.270
wearable computers there are computers
 

00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:48.099
wearable computers there are computers
nowadays and the way youngsters interact

00:53:48.099 --> 00:53:48.109
nowadays and the way youngsters interact
 

00:53:48.109 --> 00:53:49.930
nowadays and the way youngsters interact
with them and use them for several hours

00:53:49.930 --> 00:53:49.940
with them and use them for several hours
 

00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:53.170
with them and use them for several hours
a day it's clearly a new new new quality

00:53:53.170 --> 00:53:53.180
a day it's clearly a new new new quality
 

00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:54.760
a day it's clearly a new new new quality
in their life assuming they are using

00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:54.770
in their life assuming they are using
 

00:53:54.770 --> 00:53:55.390
in their life assuming they are using
that

00:53:55.390 --> 00:53:55.400
that
 

00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:58.660
that
for pasta purposes now they're also some

00:53:58.660 --> 00:53:58.670
for pasta purposes now they're also some
 

00:53:58.670 --> 00:54:01.750
for pasta purposes now they're also some
more intelligent applications that can

00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:01.760
more intelligent applications that can
 

00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:05.529
more intelligent applications that can
be built and used by them anywhere from

00:54:05.529 --> 00:54:05.539
be built and used by them anywhere from
 

00:54:05.539 --> 00:54:07.839
be built and used by them anywhere from
you know the our capabilities now that

00:54:07.839 --> 00:54:07.849
you know the our capabilities now that
 

00:54:07.849 --> 00:54:09.309
you know the our capabilities now that
they can have on their cell for what

00:54:09.309 --> 00:54:09.319
they can have on their cell for what
 

00:54:09.319 --> 00:54:11.019
they can have on their cell for what
what are cool places in peaceful tonight

00:54:11.019 --> 00:54:11.029
what are cool places in peaceful tonight
 

00:54:11.029 --> 00:54:14.799
what are cool places in peaceful tonight
for their age still doesn't exist

00:54:14.799 --> 00:54:14.809
for their age still doesn't exist
 

00:54:14.809 --> 00:54:17.829
for their age still doesn't exist
hopefully that will also be you know in

00:54:17.829 --> 00:54:17.839
hopefully that will also be you know in
 

00:54:17.839 --> 00:54:20.980
hopefully that will also be you know in
existence in here or two from now so

00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:20.990
existence in here or two from now so
 

00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:22.240
existence in here or two from now so
there are some more intelligent

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:22.250
there are some more intelligent
 

00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:25.120
there are some more intelligent
applications that they can be the users

00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:25.130
applications that they can be the users
 

00:54:25.130 --> 00:54:27.819
applications that they can be the users
or can contribute and I hope to see more

00:54:27.819 --> 00:54:27.829
or can contribute and I hope to see more
 

00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:30.640
or can contribute and I hope to see more
of that pretty soon so I want to add one

00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:30.650
