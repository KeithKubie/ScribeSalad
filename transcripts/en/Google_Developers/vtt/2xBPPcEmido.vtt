00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.890
MARTIN OMANDER: My guest today
is Joe Born from the start

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.469
up responsible for the
Hale Dreamer device

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:10.760
that we have here on the table.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:11.910
Welcome to the show, Joe.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:12.880
JOE BORN: Thanks for having me.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.510
MARTIN OMANDER: Could you tell
us a bit about your startup?

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:14.720
JOE BORN: Yeah.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.720
So we started up-- we're
a hardware manufacturer

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.580
and we started up
with the mission

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.030
to provide accessories--
particularly,

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.840
audio accessories-- for the
underserved Android segment.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.580
So first speaker dock
with a remote control.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.830
We released the Hale
Dreamer you see here.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.970
So first nightstand dock
with the silence feature

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.500
and the snooze bar.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.302
And we recently became
[? Iowa ?] [? USA ?] so lots

00:00:40.302 --> 00:00:41.760
of announcements
coming up on that.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.690
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh, great.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.356
Congratulations.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.840
So this is hardware.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.520
I can touch this as opposed to
most of the startups-- well,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.730
certainly, all the
startups I worked on

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.340
and most of the
startups I interview

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.650
here are software-only plays.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.170
Hardware is hard, I've heard.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.680
Why do you do it?

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.160
JOE BORN: Well, two reasons.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.199
One, obviously, sometimes
you need a sensor.

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.699
We needed something to charge
the phone, you need a speaker,

00:01:05.699 --> 00:01:08.322
sometimes you need a pedometer,
whatever it might be.

00:01:08.322 --> 00:01:09.780
Less obvious is
the fact that there

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.820
are very well-established,
mature sales

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.340
channels that really do help
you create awareness and sell

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.120
your product.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.790
So all the brick
and mortar that's

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.790
established and the
online channels.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.840
So you may say, geez,
if Fry's or wherever

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.480
is very daunting with the
amount of products on there,

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.330
but it's nothing compared
to the Google Play Store,

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.990
for example, which the
shelves would be endless

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.010
if you had a physical
manifestation.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.997
So it does help you to create
awareness and sell products.

00:01:35.997 --> 00:01:37.080
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh, I see.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.579
Yeah.

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:39.580
Because I've seen
this product on store

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.100
shelves here in California.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.890
And as you say, there are
far fewer products on there.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.950
How do you become one of those
relatively few products who

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.460
get shelf space?

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.880
JOE BORN: Well, this has
changed a lot over my career.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.690
And the good news is for the
people watching your show

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.840
is that it starts
online and it starts

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.600
in a very self-service
environment.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.580
So all the major--
virtually, most

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.350
of the major brick
and mortars have

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.030
online, self-service areas.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.370
So Best Buy and Walmart and
Sears and most notably, Amazon

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.057
where you list the
product yourself

00:02:12.057 --> 00:02:13.640
very similar to
putting it on the Play

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.360
Store with the description.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.000
And then you get in the flow
of Amazon and all the search

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.820
results so that now
people looking on Amazon

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.640
will see your product side
by side with all the others.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.860
And it's the reviews
or the sales history

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.470
that are all driven analytically
and allow you to rise up.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.790
And that's the first stage.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.257
All the major brick-and-mortar
retailers, small and big,

00:02:37.257 --> 00:02:39.465
look at those reviews and
look at that sales history,

00:02:39.465 --> 00:02:41.220
and that gets you your start.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.720
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh,
so the reviews--

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.636
I've seen the reviews
for your product online.

00:02:44.636 --> 00:02:45.730
They're really good.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.100
So the brick-and-mortar
guys, they look at that?

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.190
JOE BORN: Absolutely.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.730
All of them.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.500
From the small early adopters
to the big national chains,

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.580
all look at how you're
doing and how well

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.170
your product is
received on Amazon.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.130
It just make sense.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.660
They want to know if it's
well liked on Amazon,

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.020
it's more than likely going
to be well liked at Costco,

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.744
or Fry's, or Best
Buy or wherever.

00:03:05.744 --> 00:03:06.660
MARTIN OMANDER: Right.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:07.159
Right.

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:07.700
Yeah.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.660
So I could see if you're Samsung
or a big, established hardware

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.400
manufacturer like
that, it's very easy

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.870
to get into those meetings
with Fry's Electronics

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.250
and the other
brick-and-mortar guys.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.760
How do you as a
relatively unknown startup

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.640
get those meetings?

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.270
JOE BORN: Yeah.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.964
Well, it can be a challenge.

00:03:25.964 --> 00:03:28.130
Certainly, you are an unknown
startup, like you say.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.530
You've got a smaller line than
the big, established players,

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.280
but there's good news here too.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.160
One is that there are early
adopter channels for this.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.450
So Fry's, Micro Center, and
the like pride themselves

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.920
on being very cutting edge
and having everything that's

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.590
available an early
adopter would want.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.170
And two, again, all
of them are looking

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.980
towards reviews
and sales history.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.120
So there certainly
are national chains

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.540
that even reached out
to really successful,

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.152
early Amazon products.

00:03:56.152 --> 00:03:58.110
And regardless of whether
they reach out to you

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.100
or you reach out to them,
it really does matter.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.540
And you're not at
all starting cold.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.010
Secondly, these sales channels
are more open than, I think,

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.384
most your audience
might imagine.

00:04:07.384 --> 00:04:08.176
MARTIN OMANDER: OK.

00:04:08.176 --> 00:04:08.800
JOE BORN: Yeah.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.060
Well, you can hire
manufacturers reps, for example,

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.730
that work in a territory, that
have those relationships, that

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.839
have the expertise, and they
work solely on commission.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:19.690
So now you've piggybacked
on somebody else that

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.120
knows this space and that
gets you the meetings

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.325
and allows you to get
up to speed much sooner

00:04:25.325 --> 00:04:26.825
than if you're doing
it by yourself.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.670
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh,
so you were using reps

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:30.690
like this on commission?

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:31.315
JOE BORN: Yeah.

00:04:31.315 --> 00:04:33.950
So we use regional reps
that have relationships

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.665
and expertise in
any given territory

00:04:35.665 --> 00:04:38.520
and they bring you in
and get the meetings

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.250
and help to advise you as to
what's working and what's not,

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.790
and what the buyers
are thinking,

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.470
and what direction they're
going, things like that.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.553
MARTIN OMANDER: Ah, I see.

00:04:47.553 --> 00:04:49.275
So do they handle
the meetings or are

00:04:49.275 --> 00:04:50.400
you also in those meetings?

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.260
How does that work?

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.950
JOE BORN: Both.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.340
We always attend the
meetings because you're

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.490
talking about buyers
who have a lot of domain

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.780
knowledge in these areas
and these categories.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.772
There is such a rich
volume of information.

00:05:01.772 --> 00:05:02.730
This is what's working.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.354
This is what we have
found problematic.

00:05:04.354 --> 00:05:07.860
This is pricing that we found
to work and things like that.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.670
So in a world where
everything is so data-driven,

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.930
we forget that human expertise
still does have a great value.

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.090
And those meetings to
us are terrifically

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.910
rich in figuring out
what we should do

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.890
and getting a reaction
from those buyers

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.310
as to what has been a
good area, and what's

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.880
been a good approach, and
how to sell those products.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.840
A whole host of
details from packaging

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.439
to presentation in retail.

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:33.230
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh, so
it's not just matter

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.010
of you trying to convince
them to, hey, sell our stuff.

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.110
It is you're getting
valuable feedback from them.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.230
JOE BORN: Oh, absolutely.

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.280
You want to take their feedback.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.814
You want to take your sales
history at smaller channels--

00:05:44.814 --> 00:05:46.730
take your Fry's, your
Micro Center, of course,

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.190
Amazon-- learn from
that and iterate.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.320
The last thing you want to
do is launch too quickly

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.260
in a giant national
retailer to find out

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.585
that you have a
product problem or you

00:05:55.585 --> 00:05:58.460
have a presentation problem or
something about your packaging

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.780
isn't clear.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.560
Very hard to make
changes on the fly

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.970
if you're already in thousands
of outlets with huge inventory

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.350
investments, you
really can be stuck.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:10.980
So it's best to do it in phases
where you go from one step

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.134
to another.

00:06:12.134 --> 00:06:13.050
MARTIN OMANDER: I see.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.260
So do you sell more
of these online

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.370
or in brick-and-mortar
stores today, Joe?

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.730
JOE BORN: So today, we're
really just still getting

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.770
out to brick and mortars
so we sell more online.

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:22.820
That's fairly typical.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:23.900
You start online.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.160
You start with these
early adopter accounts.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.090
And then you grow to national
retailer at which point,

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.760
the national retailer tends
to dwarf the sales of online.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.900
Now for the first
time, Amazon actually

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.220
outsold Walmart on electronics.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.614
First time last year.

00:06:39.614 --> 00:06:41.030
But you've got to
remember, Amazon

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.380
has probably 100
times more products.

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.050
So for any given
product that you

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.414
get on the shelves at
a national retailer,

00:06:47.414 --> 00:06:48.830
you're probably
selling a lot more

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.007
than you were on Amazon,
generally speaking.

00:06:51.007 --> 00:06:52.090
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh, I see.

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.540
So you're seeing it as a
three-stage process then?

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:00.316
Online pioneering, offline,
and then mainstream offline?

00:07:00.316 --> 00:07:00.940
JOE BORN: Yeah.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.410
That's generally a good way
to think of it with the two

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:04.060
clustered.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:08.710
So your Amazon, your Newegg, and
Fry's, and Micro Center, those

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:10.110
can be pretty early on.

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:11.920
You're talking about
some dozens of stores,

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.880
so it's easy to manage that
inventory and that feedback,

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.720
customer service,
all that stuff.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.220
You get to the
national retailer,

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.910
that's a whole
different category.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:23.245
Thousands of stores,
huge amounts of inventory

00:07:23.245 --> 00:07:24.870
and product moving
through the channel.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.060
So you really need to
have your act together

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.827
by the time you
get on that stage.

00:07:28.827 --> 00:07:30.410
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh,
the major leagues.

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:32.270
JOE BORN: The major
leagues, so to speak.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:32.640
MARTIN OMANDER: Great.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.630
Well, best of luck in
the major leagues, Joe.

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:36.620
And thank you very much for
coming on the show today.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:36.890
JOE BORN: Yeah.

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:37.640
Thanks for having me.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.431
MARTIN OMANDER: We hope
you found something

00:07:39.431 --> 00:07:40.800
you can use in your startup.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.360
Your input matters.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.070
Please leave your
comments below.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:46.270

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.630
