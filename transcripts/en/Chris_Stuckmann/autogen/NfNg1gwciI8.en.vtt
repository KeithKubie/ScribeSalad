00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.750
scenes interesting and I was really
impressed by the way he did it now it's

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760
impressed by the way he did it now it's
 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.160
impressed by the way he did it now it's
kind of dumb about this movie is it

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170
kind of dumb about this movie is it
 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.960
kind of dumb about this movie is it
falls under that cliche where if a

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970
falls under that cliche where if a
 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.240
falls under that cliche where if a
character were to just say one sentence

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250
character were to just say one sentence
 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.250
character were to just say one sentence
the entire movie would be over and

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260
the entire movie would be over and
 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.690
the entire movie would be over and
everything would be resolved it would be

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700
everything would be resolved it would be
 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.640
everything would be resolved it would be
really awkward but there would be no

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650
really awkward but there would be no
 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:09.870
really awkward but there would be no
more movie and all this guy really has

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880
more movie and all this guy really has
 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.550
more movie and all this guy really has
to do is say you're my sister I'm your

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560
to do is say you're my sister I'm your
 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.110
to do is say you're my sister I'm your
brother but he just can't find it in

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120
brother but he just can't find it in
 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.970
brother but he just can't find it in
himself to figure out when to say that

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980
himself to figure out when to say that
 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.770
himself to figure out when to say that
and so the movie keeps going and it does

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780
and so the movie keeps going and it does
 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.449
and so the movie keeps going and it does
seem really unrealistic that a person

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459
seem really unrealistic that a person
 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:19.949
seem really unrealistic that a person
wouldn't say look we need to talk and

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959
wouldn't say look we need to talk and
 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.840
wouldn't say look we need to talk and
just say it at the same time though the

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850
just say it at the same time though the
 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.030
just say it at the same time though the
movie was able to realistically find

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040
movie was able to realistically find
 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.580
movie was able to realistically find
ways to make it seem like this makes

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590
ways to make it seem like this makes
 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.289
ways to make it seem like this makes
some sense that was really my main

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299
some sense that was really my main
 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:29.520
some sense that was really my main
problem with this movie I kept telling

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530
problem with this movie I kept telling
 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.809
problem with this movie I kept telling
to be like look dude just say it just

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819
to be like look dude just say it just
 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.059
to be like look dude just say it just
tell her now at the same time though it

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069
tell her now at the same time though it
 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:35.039
tell her now at the same time though it
did kind of add to the movie because it

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049
did kind of add to the movie because it
 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.020
did kind of add to the movie because it
gave the scenes an extra bit of tension

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030
gave the scenes an extra bit of tension
 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.280
gave the scenes an extra bit of tension
because he kept seeming like he was

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290
because he kept seeming like he was
 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.990

about to you know and I like the kind of

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000
about to you know and I like the kind of
 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.879
about to you know and I like the kind of
twisted style the movie had because you

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:41.889
twisted style the movie had because you
 

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:43.830
twisted style the movie had because you
could tell she was falling for him and

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840
could tell she was falling for him and
 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.740
could tell she was falling for him and
that bothered him obviously because it's

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750
that bothered him obviously because it's
 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.629
that bothered him obviously because it's
his sister but she didn't know that and

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639
his sister but she didn't know that and
 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.309
his sister but she didn't know that and
so it created a bit of a drama that you

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319
so it created a bit of a drama that you
 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:51.780
so it created a bit of a drama that you
