00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.920
For centuries, before refrigeration, an old
Russian practice was to drop a frog into a

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:02.920
bucket of milk to keep the milk from spoiling.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:03.944
In modern times, many believed that this was
nothing more than an old wives’ tale.

00:00:03.944 --> 00:00:04.944
But researchers at Moscow State University,
led by organic chemist Dr. Albert Lebedev,

00:00:04.944 --> 00:00:05.944
have shown that there could be some benefit
to doing this, though of course in the end

00:00:05.944 --> 00:00:06.944
you’ll be drinking milk that a frog was
in.

00:00:06.944 --> 00:00:07.944
Ice boxes first became available to consumers
in the early to mid-19th century and, with

00:00:07.944 --> 00:00:08.944
that, the ice trade became big business.

00:00:08.944 --> 00:00:12.210
New England and Norway became major purveyors
of ice, but anywhere it was cold, ice was

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.210
a major export.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.240
Usually made out of wood with tin or zinc
walls and insulation material like sawdust,

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.020
cork, or straw, ice boxes were popular until
they were rendered obsolete by the electrical

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.369
refrigerator starting around the 1930s.

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.369
Jacob Perkins invented the first version of
the refrigerator in 1834 when it was discovered

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:20.390
that the hazardous compound ammonia, when
liquefied, had a cooling effect.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:21.790
But it wasn’t until the late 1920s when
Freon was developed by General Motors and

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:22.790
DuPont as a “nontoxic” cooling agent,
and replaced ammonia, that refrigerators for

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:23.790
consumers started to gain traction.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.800
Despite the prevalence of ice in parts of
Russia, in certain small rural Russian villages

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.939
many didn’t have access to ice boxes, so
they had to find ways to keep things cold

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:31.939
and unspoiled.

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.970
A practice developed, that continued into
the 20th century, as described by Dr. Lebedev

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.630
from memories from his childhood,

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.460
[For] small portions of milk to drink, they
used to put [a] frog inside…

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.200
A small frog over there could prevent the
milk from being spoiled.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.710
This rather curious practice was an inspiration
for a study and, then, a discovery that may

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.940
lead to a significant new source of antibiotics.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.621
In 2010, scientists from United Arab Emirates
University made an announcement that the secretions

00:00:59.621 --> 00:01:04.440
from certain frogs’ skins have antibacterial
and antifungal properties.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.750
Using species native to African countries,
they studied the compounds coming from the

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.850
frogs, which are known as antimicrobial peptides
and are a string of amino acids.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.591
After isolating these compounds, they began
testing them against various bacterial infections.

00:01:17.591 --> 00:01:18.591
For example, the dreaded “Iraqibacter,”
a drug-resistant bacterial infection that

00:01:18.591 --> 00:01:19.591
has been known to hit wounded soldiers in
Iraq could (once again, potentially) be fought

00:01:19.591 --> 00:01:20.820
with a compound found in the skin of a mink
frog that are native to North America.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:21.820
Secretions from a foothill four-legged frog
may have the potential to fight the well-known

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:22.820
resistant MRSA staph skin infection.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.620
In 2012, scientists from Moscow State University
decided to take this a step further by breaking

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.990
down the compounds and studying the individual
peptides.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.031
In a study entitled “Composition and Antimicrobial
Activity of Skin Peptidome of Russian Brown

00:01:34.031 --> 00:01:39.070
Frogs” published in the Journal of Proteome
Research in November 2012, and using Russian

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.390
brown frogs (which are edible and considered
a delicacy), they extracted secretions by

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.890
applying electrodes.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.590
What came out was a cocktail of 76 different
peptides that all had different properties.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.270
Michael Zasloff, now a professor at Georgetown
University, but formerly a researcher with

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.570
the National Institutes of Health said in
an interview that, “What is amazing is that

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.480
no two frogs have the same cocktail.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.190
They’re all different, and all beautifully
tuned to deal with the microbes that these

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.570
animals face.”

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.150
As promising as the results are so far, many
scientists are skeptical of any real benefit

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.200
coming from them.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.030
For instance, Jun O. Liu, a professor of pharmacology
at John Hopkins University School of Medicine,

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.280
stated in reference to other apparent natural
occurring “magic antibiotics,” “There

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.241
are natural substances that work in a lab
beautifully but then when you give it to a

00:02:25.241 --> 00:02:28.490
human it’s totally inactive or it’s toxic.”

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.680
While this all may or may not ultimately be
medicinally helpful for humans, beginning

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.270
centuries ago certain Russians seem to have
been on to something with putting frogs in

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.530
milk to delay it spoiling.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.950
Although, I think we can all agree that putting
a frog in one’s milk takes a back seat to

00:02:42.950 --> 00:03:06.530
the other age-old way to store milk without
refrigeration- making it into delicious cheese.
