00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.860
In today’s day and age, one of the pastimes
of movie fans is theorizing on the Internet.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.360
With so many big projects being produced under
the watchful eye of social media users, everybody’s

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.660
got a hypothesis of what might happen in the
latest Hollywood tentpoles.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.880
Speculating is a great deal of fun, but there
are times when it doesn’t amount to anything.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.880
Learn why it’s always important to keep
those grains of salt handy in our video, 10

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.950
movie theories that fans (or the Internet)
were completely wrong about.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:32.950
WARNING.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.460
This video will contain spoilers for Captain
America: Civil War and Batman V Superman.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.460
Captain America: Civil War

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.460
Since the third Captain America film was a
loose adaptation of the Civil War comic, many

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.460
were curious to see how far the Russos would
go in bringing the panels to life.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.460
The famous story arc ends with the death of
Steve Rogers, and there were rumors suggesting

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.460
the Civil War movie would be bookended by
funeral scenes.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.460
This led many to believe that Rogers would
perish on the big screen – before a triumphant

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.460
revival in a later film.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.460
But when the credits rolled, the Star Spangled
Man was still alive, hiding in Wakanda as

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.460
a fugitive.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.460
Chris Evans is so great in the role, we’re
happy he’s sticking around.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.460
Batman V Superman

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.460
With the DCEU introducing viewers to a grizzled,
experienced Batman, it’s evident that this

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.460
Dark Knight has been through a lot and lost
some allies along the way.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.840
The marketing made it clear that Jason Todd’s
Robin had been killed at some point, but some

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.269
reports indicated Gotham’s police commissioner
Jim Gordon was also gone by the time the film

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:58.269
started.

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:01.480
Thankfully, that wasn’t true, and the character
will appear in Justice League, portrayed by

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.320
Oscar winner J.K. Simmons.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.760
Gordon is such an icon in the Batman mythos,
it would be a waste if the DCEU never featured

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.860
him at all.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:09.930
Batman V Superman

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.860
Zack Snyder drew some criticisms for his take
on Superman nemesis Lex Luthor, but there

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.170
could have been even more outcries if some
rumors about the character proved true.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.469
It was speculated that Jesse Eisenberg’s
Lex was living on the streets at age 14 and

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:25.250
was overseeing a street gang at 15.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.759
He was also allegedly into tattoos, and had
a sleeve of the Metropolis skyline down his

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:30.759
arm.

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.210
In actuality, Luthor inherited LexCorp after
his father died and looked to develop anti-Kryptonian

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.210
technology.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.729
Fans were already turned off by Eisenberg’s
little quirks, so who knows what the reaction

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.590
to a tatted-up, street smart Lex would have
been.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.149
Star Wars: The Force Awakens

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.350
Luke Skywalker was noticeably absent from
all the marketing materials for this anticipated

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.770
sequel, and many fans were wondering why.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.760
Some theorized that the original trilogy hero
had succumbed to the Dark Side, and Disney

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.509
was saving that as a massive reveal for the
final film.

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.609
A popular belief was that Luke had become
Kylo Ren, and the announcement of Adam Driver’s

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:05.210
casting was just an elaborate bait-and-switch.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.140
Turns out, Luke is still a Jedi Knight and
the reason for him not being in any trailers

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.930
was that he’s just in one scene: the last
one.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.190
That would have been a big spoiler to share
in promotional materials.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.190
Star Wars: The Force Awakens

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.190
Back when the basic plot to Episode 7 was
unknown, fans were left to their own devices

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.190
to concoct a story.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.190
One bit of speculation proposed that Kylo
Ren was trying to resurrect the villain Darth

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.190
Vader since he idolized the Dark Lord so much,
and the heroes would have to work to stop

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.190
that from happening.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.190
Bringing people back from the dead doesn’t
appear to be in Kylo’s plans, as he just

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.190
craves the power of the Dark Side.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.190
In the end, it’s good this was false.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.190
Vader is an intricate part of Star Wars history,
but it’s time for the new generation to

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.190
shine.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.190
James Bond

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.190
Longtime James Bond fans are familiar with
one of the more famous Internet theories:

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.190
James Bond is actually a code name given to
different individuals.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.140
This explains why the character changes physical
appearance every so often and is still a relatively

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.150
young man 50 years into his career.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.110
Yet, evidence proves it false.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.050
A scene in Skyfall depicts Bond’s childhood
home, where the tombstones of his parents

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.050
are present.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.940
Both mother and father are named Bond, meaning
that’s 007’s real name.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.670
As for why he keeps telling everyone it, we’ll
leave that up to you.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.670
Jurassic World

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.290
It wasn’t enough for Jurassic Park fans
that Hollywood’s new favorite leading man

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.120
Chris Pratt was starring in Jurassic World;
they had to craft a whole backstory for his

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.170
new character.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.150
Some believe that Pratt’s Owen is an adult
version of the child Dr. Alan Grant terrorizes

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.260
with a raptor claw in the original film.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.790
The “proof” is that Grant told the boy
to show the raptors “respect,” and Owen

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.380
has a line in Jurassic World where he mentions
his relationship with the raptors is “based

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.380
on respect.”

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.900
It’s a stretch, and there’s no further
evidence in the film that supports it.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.820
This one’s most likely wishful thinking.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.700
Star Wars: The Force Awakens

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.850
Back when the basic plot to Episode 7 was
unknown, fans were left to their own devices

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.810
to concoct a story.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.490
One bit of speculation proposed that Kylo
Ren was trying to resurrect the villain Darth

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.620
Vader since he idolized the Dark Lord so much,
and the heroes would have to work to stop

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.870
that from happening.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.400
Bringing people back from the dead doesn’t
appear to be in Kylo’s plans, as he just

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.180
craves the power of the Dark Side.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.560
In the end, it’s good this was false.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.590
Vader is an intricate part of Star Wars history,
but it’s time for the new generation to

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.840
shine.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.670
Ferris Bueller’s Day Off

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.540
Ever since Ferris, Cameron, and Sloane made
Chicago their playground, moviegoers have

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.900
had one question: which specific day did they
take off?

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.370
Using the information from the Cubs game the
trio attends, fans have pointed to June 5,

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.180
1985 as the exact date, but that doesn’t
add up.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.200
There’s a famous sequence where Ferris sings
during the Von Steuben Day Parade, which is

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.970
typically held on or around September 17 – not
in the middle of summer.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.540
This means that the June 5, 1985 theory is
incorrect, and John Hughes just devised a

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.340
composite day for the purposes of his film,
which is just fine by us.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.099
The Dark Knight Rises

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:32.110
The finale to Christopher Nolan’s Batman
trilogy was no stranger to the rumor mill

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.400
as anticipation heated up.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.860
A leaked set photo teased a potential plot
development that never game to be.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.509
Depicting a green-screened pit in the desert,
some thought that the image was showing the

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:45.289
Lazarus Pit, which in the comics brought Ra’s
al Ghul back to life.

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:49.360
In the end, there was a pit in The Dark Knight
Rises, but it was Bane’s torturous underground

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.719
prison and not the Lazarus.

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:55.960
Since Nolan’s franchise was steeped in reality,
a magic pit always seemed like a farfetched

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:56.960
inclusion.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.770
Captain America: Civil War

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.719
Audiences met Hawkeye’s family in Avengers:
Age of Ultron, and some thought they could

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:05.729
be brought back for a tragic return in Civil
War.

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:09.680
Reports indicated that the villain Crossbones,
played by Frank Grillo, would murder Hawkeye’s

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.320
wife and children, leading to a fight between
Crossbones and the sharp shooter.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.539
Hawkeye would eventually win by killing his
enemy with four arrows – one for each dead

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:18.539
family member.

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:22.870
Civil War was heavy enough as it was with
collateral damage and superhero guilt complexes.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.509
The last thing we needed was a takeout of
an entire family, so it’s good this was

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:57.590
false.

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.280
Those are our picks for movie theories the
Internet got wrong.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.470
Are there any we missed?

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:02.470
