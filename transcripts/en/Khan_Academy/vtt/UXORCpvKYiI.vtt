00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.740
- [Instructor] Let's do another example

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.060
where we are projecting something

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.220
and it lands at a different level

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.140
and we'll also figure out
some other interesting things.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.760
We'll figure out what the
actual velocity vector

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.200
is when it's landing, so both

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.410
its magnitude and its direction.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:13.950
So let's do a situation.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.290
So let's say we are launching
something from ground level,

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.180
and we're gonna launch it at a
pretty steep angle over here.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.493
So let's say we launch it with an angle,

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.520
let's say we launch it with an angle of,

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.300
let me just, let's say it's 80 degrees.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.493
We launch it at an 80
degree angle, at, let me.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.060
We launch it at an 80 degree angle,

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.840
80 degree angle, and
it is going to be going

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.610
at 30 meters per second,

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.300
30 meters per second, so that's
the length of this vector,

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.960
that's the magnitude of that vector,

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.750
and let's say we want to
make it land on this landing,

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.680
and this landing right over here,

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.510
this landing right over here has a height,

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.800
this landing over here
has a height of 10 meters.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.140
This height over here is 10 meters,

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.180
so what I wanna do first

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.800
of all is I wanna figure out
how far along the landing,

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.610
how far along the landing
do I actually land,

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.310
how far along the landing.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.410
So, and maybe I'll add some
other information right here.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.090
So say from this launching
point to the beginning

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.690
of the landing, let's say

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.820
that this right over here is two meters,

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:24.800
two meters, so we just want

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.010
to know how far along
the landing do we land.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.400
So like we did before, we want to

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.070
break this vector into its horizontal

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.610
and vertical components,

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.380
its vertical and vertical components,

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.150
and I'm gonna go a little
bit faster in this video,

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.270
'cause hopefully we're getting the knack

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.920
for this type of thing.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.810
So our velocity, our
velocity in the vertical

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:44.990
or our vertical component

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.580
of our velocity is going to
be equal to the magnitude

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.240
of our total velocity,
30 meters per second,

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.830
times, and it's going to
be the sine of 80 degrees,

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.210
'cause sine is opposite over hypotenuse,

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.600
times the sine of 80 degrees,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.820
and our, and we'll just get
it out of the way right now,

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.200
the horizontal component

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.060
of our velocity is going
to be 30 meters per second,

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.350
and I'm not writing the units here,

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.440
just to save space, times
the cosine of 80 degrees.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.900
Once again, cosine is adjacent,

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.300
adjacent, adjacent over hypotenuse,

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.730
and if you feel like I'm skipping steps,

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.970
in the last few videos, I go
into this in much more detail.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.750
So, how much time do we spend in the air?

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.660
How much time do we spend in the air?

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.220
So, once again, in the last few videos,

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.800
we saw that we can look at our,

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.043
we can look at displacement,

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.610
if we want to figure out time in the air,

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.120
we know that displacement is
equal to the initial velocity,

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.580
initial velocity times time,

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.630
plus acceleration, let me
write times change in times,

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.810
since that's more technically,

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.000
that's technically more correct,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.700
plus acceleration times change

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.540
in time squared, over, over two.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.440
Now, in our situation, we know
what our initial velocity is,

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.980
we are talking about the vertical
direction right over here,

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.790
so our initial velocity
is going to be this.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.670
We are trying to figure
out how time in the air,

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.810
and the vertical
component determines that,

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.360
because at some point, when
it hits back to the ground,

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.850
it's not gonna be traveling anymore,

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.980
so that's what's determining
its time in the air.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.990
So we know that, we know the acceleration.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.250
Remember, our convention,

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.470
when we are dealing with
the vertical dimension

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.570
is up is positive, down is negative,

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.760
so this is negative 9.8
meters per second squared,

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.680
and then we can, and then
what is the total displacement

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.780
that we are gonna have?

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.530
Well, we are starting at ground level,

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.540
and we are just talking about
the vertical, remember that.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.060
So our total displacement
is going to be 10 meters,

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.860
so this value right here
is going to be 10 meters,

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.810
so it simplifies to 10 meters,

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.540
I won't write the units here,

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.760
is equals 10 is equal to,
what's 30 sine of 80 degrees?

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.760
So we have 30 times the sine
of 80 degrees, gives us 29.54.

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.840
29.54.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.840
So this is 29.54 times our change in time,

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.670
times our change in time,

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.320
and so this is negative
9.8 divided by two,

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.290
so it's negative, I'll
do that same green color,

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.310
four point, that's not
the same green color,

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.920
negative 4.9 meters per second squared.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.440
I'm not writing the units here,

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.950
times delta t squared,
times delta t squared,

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.150
and then we can subtract
10 from both sides

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.760
and write this in a traditional
quadratic equation form,

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.580
so we get negative, and I'm
gonna flip the sides too,

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.580
negative 4.9 times delta t squared,

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.020
and then we have, plus
29.54 times delta t,

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.230
minus 10, minus 10 is equal to zero,

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.250
and then we can use the quadratic
formula to find the roots

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.300
of this, so the delta t's

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.670
that satisfy this quadratic equation are

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.710
going to be negative b,

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.400
so negative 29.54, plus

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.240
or minus the square root of 29.54 squared,

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.050
b squared, minus four, minus four,

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.953
times a, which is negative 4.9,

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.660
for the negative times a
negative is a positive.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.140
So it's plus four times
positive 4.9, times,

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.170
or I shouldn't have, I
shouldn't have jumped so fast

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:30.020
to get rid of the negative.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.810
So it's gonna be minus four times a,

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.810
which is negative 4.9, times c,

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.740
which is negative 10, so just a times c,

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.590
negative 4.9 times negative 10, let me

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.520
just write negative 4.9 times
negative 10, these two guys,

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.010
their signs are going to cancel out.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:54.010
All of that, all of that
over, all of that over two a.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:58.390
All of that over negative 4.9
times two, so negative 9.8.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:59.930
And like we saw in the last video,

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.610
we want a positive value for this.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.240
A negative time is nonsensical,

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.070
that's kind of going into the past,

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.140
so we want a positive value.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.250
And since we have a
negative in the denominator,

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.570
we want to have a negative value up here,

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.520
and if we already have
a negative value here,

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.980
if we have subtract
from that native value,

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.770
we're definitely gonna have
a negative value up here,

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.310
and then you divide by a negative value,

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:19.210
we'll get a positive value,

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.550
so we can really focus on
the subtracting the radical,

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:23.510
and you could try it out.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:24.990
If you tried the positive version,

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.130
you're gonna get a negative
value for this entire thing.

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.720
Do that on, you can try
that out after this video,

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.700
just to verify that you
get a nonsensical answer.

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.660
So let's use a negative right over here,

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.660
so we have negative 29.54
minus the square root of,

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:49.150
the square root of 29.54 squared,

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.180
and then we have minus four,

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.780
minus four, times negative 4.9
times negative 10, these two,

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:55.613
when you take the product,

00:06:55.613 --> 00:06:58.810
it's positive 49, so times,

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:03.810
times 49, and I should add
a parentheses over there,

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.980
so let me insert a parentheses.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:10.980
You can insert parentheses,
okay, so times 49.

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:13.620
So this right here will
give me the numerator

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.680
if I evaluate this, got me negative value,

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.470
and I divide that by negative 9.8, so

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:24.470
divided by negative 9.8
gives me 5.67, 5.67 seconds.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:31.440
This is equal to 5.67 seconds,

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.070
and you could keep the units in there

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.340
and make sure that all of the
dimensional analysis works,

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:37.770
and I think you'll find that it does.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:39.920
So our total, our total vertical,

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.030
the total time in the air

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:46.030
is 5.6, the total time in
the air is 5.67 seconds.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.120
Now, what I want to do,

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.910
the whole point of this is to figure out,

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:55.570
is to figure out how far
along this landing we land.

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:57.000
Well, our horizontal component

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.320
of our velocity is right over here.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.500
We know that, we know
that our displacement

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.240
in the horizontal direction,

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.610
our displacement in the
horizontal direction will be

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:10.030
our velocity in the horizontal direction,

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:11.180
and it's a constant velocity,

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.850
so it's the same thing
as our average velocity

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:15.890
in the horizontal direction,
times the change in time.

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:17.360
Well, the change in time is,

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.270
so I'll just that times,
our change in time.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:24.140
So this is going to be equal
to 30 cosine of 80 degrees,

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:28.320
30 cosine of 80 degrees,

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:33.320
times 5.67 seconds, times 5.67 seconds,

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.030
and this, I won't write the units.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:36.710
This is meters per second times seconds,

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:38.780
it'll give us an answer in meters.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.810
So once again, we have,

00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:45.310
this is our time, this is
the 5.67, times 30 cosine

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:51.830
of 80 degrees, gives us 29.53 meters.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.620
So our total horizontal traveling,

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:57.550
displacement I guess, we could say,

00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:01.550
is 29, I already forgot
the number, 29.53 meters.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:05.950
29.53 meters, and I'll
write this as a vector,

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:08.000
that is our horizontal displacement,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.800
it's equal to 29.53 meters.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.140
Now, we've done a lot of
deconstructing vectors,

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:16.720
what I thought would be
interesting in this video

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.330
is to construct a vector.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.150
So we know our horizontal displacement.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:21.980
We also know our vertical displacement,

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:25.800
it's positive 10 meters, so
what's our total displacement?

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.230
Let me write this down.

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:29.250
So we have a horizontal displacement.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:34.250
We have a horizontal
displacement of 29.53 meters,

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:38.210
and we have a vertical
displacement of plus 10 meters.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:42.340
We have a vertical displacement
of positive 10 meters,

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:45.360
and so what is our total displacement?

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.540
What is our total
displacement going to be?

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.000
Well, we could use the
Pythagorean theorem now here.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.470
The square of the magnitude

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:54.910
of our total displacement is
going to be equal to the sum

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:57.250
of these two squares, or another way,

00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:59.250
this is just the Pythagorean theorem,

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:02.150
so we could have, if we call
this length over here c,

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.294
or let me just write it,

00:10:03.294 --> 00:10:06.810
this is the magnitude of our
displacement right over here,

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:10.100
the magnitude of our total
displacement squared is

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:14.230
going to be equal to 10
squared plus 29.53 squared.

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:19.230
So it's going to be 10
squared plus 29.53 squared.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.330
I'm gonna do that same
color, plus 29.53 squared.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.220
If we want to solve for this,

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.120
we just take the square
root of both sides,

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.750
so I'll just do that in place.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:34.810
So if we just take the
square root of both sides,

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:38.090
we will get the magnitude
of our total displacement,

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:40.810
and I can get the calculator
out once again to do that.

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:42.990
So the magnitude of our total displacement

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:46.000
is the square root of, 10 squared

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.480
is just 100, plus 29, I can even use,

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.950
well, I could use all of this information,

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:53.560
so that I don't even lose some precision.

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.050
I could say second answer,

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:56.670
that literally means the previous answer,

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:59.913
which is that 29.53 squared,

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:05.700
gives us a total
displacement of 31.18 meters.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:09.330
So this is equal to 31.18 meters,

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.428
and of course, it's a vector,

00:11:11.428 --> 00:11:13.410
so we've only given you the magnitude,

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:15.070
we also need the direction.

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:16.930
So one way to specify direction

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:19.580
is to give you the angle
with the horizontal,

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:22.410
and let's call that angle theta,

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:25.550
and once again, we can use our trig,

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:27.400
our trig functions over here.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.460
We could use pretty much
any of the trig functions,

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:32.330
but we know the opposite side

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.470
is 10, we know the hypotenuse here

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:38.380
is 31.18, so why not use sine,

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.590
sine is opposite over hypotenuse.

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:42.740
So we know that the sine

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:47.740
of theta is going to be
equal to 10 over 31.18.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:54.330
10 over 31.18, or if you
want to solve for theta,

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:56.790
you take the arcsine of both sides,

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:58.500
or the inverse sine of both sides,

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.660
you get theta is equal to the inverse sine

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:06.627
or I could write arcsine over
here, of 10, of 10 over 31.8.

00:12:10.727 --> 00:12:13.010
10 over 31.18, I should say.

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:15.810
So let's once again get the
calculator out to figure out

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:18.380
that value, so I'm gonna
take the inverse sine.

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:20.123
Once again, so this is the
same thing as the arcsine.

00:12:20.123 --> 00:12:22.180
This just says, give me the angle

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:23.770
that when I take its sine,

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:25.440
I get this value right over here,

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.930
so the inverse sine of 10

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:31.890
divided by our previous answer, 31.18.

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:36.060
I'll just say that our
previous answer is equal to,

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:40.453
so this says, give me the angle
whose sine is 10 over 31.18.

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:45.100
So I have 18.7 degrees,

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:49.450
or 18.71 degrees, so this
is equal to 18.71 degrees,

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:55.390
18.71 degrees above the horizontal.

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:56.800
So here we've constructed a vector,

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.390
we took its vertical component

00:12:58.390 --> 00:12:59.810
and its horizontal component

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:02.120
and we were able to figure
out the total vector,

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:05.590
so this projectile in this situation is,

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:06.600
its total displacement,

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.910
so just to make it clear,

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:10.460
its path will look something like this,

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:12.613
its path will look something like this.

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:15.470
Its path is gonna look
something like this,

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:18.250
and we've just calculated
its total displacement,

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:21.410
its total displacement is 31.18 meters,

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:24.760
18.71 degrees above the horizontal.

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:25.770
And the other thing I've realized

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:26.710
is when I started this problem,

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:28.850
I asked you, I think I was asking you

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:30.910
how far along the platform,

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:34.190
and we've figured out its
total horizontal displacement,

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:36.980
so if you wanna know how
far along the platform,

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:38.960
the platform starts two
meters to the right,

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.950
so it's really 27.53 meters along

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:44.673
the platform is where it lands.
