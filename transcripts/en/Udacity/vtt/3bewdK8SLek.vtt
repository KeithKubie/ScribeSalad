00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now, let's look at the solution for a problem concerning waning immunity.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
First things first, the constant waning time should be defined as 2 times the infectious time.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We can show this mathematically using the equations we have for the

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
derivatives of S, I, and R with their respective time.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We know that after a long period of time you want to attain a steady state situation

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and there's a number of people in each portion to the population--

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
susceptible, infected, and recover stays constant.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Since they want to find out how long people should spend in the recovered stage,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
we start with the time derivative of R and set that equal to zero.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Since you know that Rdot now has an extra term added to it or actually subtracted from it

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
showing the number of people that are leaving the recovered population

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and going back to the infected population.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
We can set these to terms right here equal to zero as well.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Just to note, I've used CINF to stand for the infectious time

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and CWAN to stand for the waning time.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Now with just a little bit of Algebra, we come up with the answer that R=2I.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Since we know that we want the number of recovered people to be twice the number

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
of infected people, we can plug in this extra information to the equation above

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and end up with the answer that the waning time is equal to twice the infectious time.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
This put us directly into the next part of the problem.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We defined R to S in the same way that I to R is defined except that we replace infectious time

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
as the waning time and I step with R step as you can see right here.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Then moving on to our recursive relations, for each element in a step plus one position,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
we need to take into account the value of the previous element in the number of people

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
added and subtracted from the population during each time step.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
We know that the one thing that has changed in this model from the standard SIR model

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
is that people are now moving from the recovered population back to the susceptible population.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000
This is why we've needed to add in this extra term R to S, which we subtract from R and add to S.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Now, let's run the program and see what we get.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Here we see we end up with this fancy graph,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
which has three different series for the three different parts of the population we're looking at.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Remembering how we set the initial values for S, I, and R.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Remember that the blue line here stands for the susceptible population.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
The green line stands for the infected population,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and the red line stands for the recovered population.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And the maximum time that we're looking at 60 days,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
you can see that the red line is graphing twice as many people over here

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
as the green line is marking, which is exactly the answer that we wanted to end up with.

00:02:30.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Congratulations on successfully completing the first problem of Unit 3.
