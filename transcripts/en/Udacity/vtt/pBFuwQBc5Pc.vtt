Let's do one more practice
question involving a discount.

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.490
So let's say the earrings are 30%
off at your favorite store.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.720
Anyways, they're on sale 30% off, and
you buy a pair that normally costs $25.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.687
How much will you pay
after the discount?

00:00:14.687 --> 00:00:17.800
And be careful here,
I'm not asking what the discount is.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.990
I'm asking how much do you
pay after the discount?

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.090
And you can enter your
answer in this box.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.150
And I've given you the dollar sign.
