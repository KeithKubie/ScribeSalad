00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:08.200
I can end by saying the marketing as you
clearly saw is not just directed towards

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:08.210
clearly saw is not just directed towards
 

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:10.540
clearly saw is not just directed towards
smokers but it is definitely going to

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:10.550
smokers but it is definitely going to
 

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:12.730
smokers but it is definitely going to
appeal you know based on the evidence

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:12.740
appeal you know based on the evidence
 

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:16.840
appeal you know based on the evidence
with other products and other issues it

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:16.850
with other products and other issues it
 

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:19.060
with other products and other issues it
will appeal to a wide range of people

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:19.070
will appeal to a wide range of people
 

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:21.670

making it more acceptable thanks ray and

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:21.680
making it more acceptable thanks ray and
 

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:23.410
making it more acceptable thanks ray and
in this to that I think one thing that

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:23.420
in this to that I think one thing that
 

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:26.110
in this to that I think one thing that
we're seeing is this is a trend an issue

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:26.120
we're seeing is this is a trend an issue
 

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:27.310
we're seeing is this is a trend an issue

the market and of course we have
 

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:56.530

evidence to support both arguments and I

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:56.540
evidence to support both arguments and I

would suggest that ultimately whether

these products have any
like health benefit or harm will be

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:01.640
like health benefit or harm will be
 

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.460
like health benefit or harm will be
dictated by how they're regulated and

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:03.470
dictated by how they're regulated and
 

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:05.680
dictated by how they're regulated and
right now we have different countries

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:05.690
right now we have different countries
 

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:07.000
right now we have different countries
that provide very different regulatory

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:07.010
that provide very different regulatory
 

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:09.790
that provide very different regulatory
models so for the time being the United

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:09.800
models so for the time being the United
 

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.440
models so for the time being the United
States is among the least regulated

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:11.450
States is among the least regulated
 

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:15.490

e-cigarettes have been approved for sale

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:18.050
e-cigarettes have been approved for sale
 

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:20.290
e-cigarettes have been approved for sale
so technically speaking e cigarettes

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:20.300
so technically speaking e cigarettes
 

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:21.940
so technically speaking e cigarettes
with nicotine are legal for sale in

and a half million Canadians that have
 

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:27.460
and a half million Canadians that have
tried these products and that's not

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:27.470
tried these products and that's not
 

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:30.070
tried these products and that's not
terribly well enforced but in the middle

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:30.080
terribly well enforced but in the middle
 

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.720
terribly well enforced but in the middle
you have something like the European

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:31.730
you have something like the European
 

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:34.180
you have something like the European
Union where they've you cigarettes are

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:34.190
Union where they've you cigarettes are
 

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:36.010
Union where they've you cigarettes are
widely available for sale but they've

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:36.020
widely available for sale but they've
 

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:37.570
widely available for sale but they've
decided to regulate them like tobacco

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:37.580
decided to regulate them like tobacco
 

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:39.580
decided to regulate them like tobacco
products so there are comprehensive bans

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:39.590
products so there are comprehensive bans
 

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:41.500
products so there are comprehensive bans
on how they're advertised and marketing

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:41.510
on how they're advertised and marketing
 

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:43.840

they're taxed and there's some level of

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:43.850
they're taxed and there's some level of
 

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:47.320
they're taxed and there's some level of
product standards and the EU model also

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:47.330
product standards and the EU model also
 

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:49.330
product standards and the EU model also
provides some flexibility for member

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:49.340
provides some flexibility for member
 

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:51.610
provides some flexibility for member
states so we see that the United Kingdom

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:51.620
states so we see that the United Kingdom
 

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:53.680
states so we see that the United Kingdom
for example has developed a regulatory

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:53.690
for example has developed a regulatory
 

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:56.620
for example has developed a regulatory
framework to license e cigarettes and

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:56.630
framework to license e cigarettes and
 

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:58.930
framework to license e cigarettes and
other nicotine products as medicines and

00:19:58.930 --> 00:19:58.940
other nicotine products as medicines and
 

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.630
other nicotine products as medicines and
they actually approve the first product

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:01.640
they actually approve the first product
 

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.580
they actually approve the first product
interestingly as a product developed by

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:03.590
interestingly as a product developed by
 

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:05.370
interestingly as a product developed by
a British American Tobacco subsidiary

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:05.380
a British American Tobacco subsidiary
 

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:07.840
a British American Tobacco subsidiary
but the UK model is very much based on

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:07.850
but the UK model is very much based on
 

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:09.520
but the UK model is very much based on
harm reduction and the principle that

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:09.530
harm reduction and the principle that
 

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:12.460
harm reduction and the principle that
the extent of the regulations should be

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:12.470
the extent of the regulations should be
 

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:14.590
the extent of the regulations should be
proportional to the extent of harm for

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:14.600
proportional to the extent of harm for
 

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:16.750
proportional to the extent of harm for
the product and what's also interesting

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:16.760
the product and what's also interesting
 

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.180
the product and what's also interesting
in the UK is at the same time as they've

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:19.190
in the UK is at the same time as they've
 

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:20.620
in the UK is at the same time as they've
licensed the product is a medicine

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:20.630
licensed the product is a medicine
 

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:23.890
licensed the product is a medicine
they've also increased their regulation

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:23.900
they've also increased their regulation
 

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.570
they've also increased their regulation
of conventional products in different

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:25.580
of conventional products in different
 

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:29.050
of conventional products in different
ways so internationally I think some of

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:29.060
ways so internationally I think some of
 

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:31.060
ways so internationally I think some of
the key questions or evidence gaps that

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:31.070
the key questions or evidence gaps that
 

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:33.940
the key questions or evidence gaps that
regulators are confronting I would

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:33.950
regulators are confronting I would
 

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:35.440
regulators are confronting I would
suggest that the first one is to really

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:35.450
suggest that the first one is to really
 

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:38.020
suggest that the first one is to really
identify the best type of regulation for

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:38.030
identify the best type of regulation for
 

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:40.930
identify the best type of regulation for
minimizing excess risks we know that

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:40.940
minimizing excess risks we know that
 

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:43.600
minimizing excess risks we know that
these products are harmful we also know

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:43.610
these products are harmful we also know
 

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:45.220
these products are harmful we also know
that there are significantly less

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:45.230
that there are significantly less
 

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:48.310
that there are significantly less
harmful than conventional cigarettes but

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:48.320
harmful than conventional cigarettes but
 

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.110
harmful than conventional cigarettes but
they vary in terms of what goes in and

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:50.120
they vary in terms of what goes in and
 

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:51.460
they vary in terms of what goes in and
what comes out of these products so how

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:51.470
what comes out of these products so how
 

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:53.410
what comes out of these products so how
can you regulate to minimize any

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:53.420
can you regulate to minimize any
 

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:56.410
can you regulate to minimize any
avoidable risk and I think regulators

00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:56.420
avoidable risk and I think regulators
 

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:58.060
avoidable risk and I think regulators
are really asking where product design

00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:58.070
are really asking where product design
 

00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:00.220
are really asking where product design
is going so these products are evolving

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:00.230
is going so these products are evolving
 

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:02.680
is going so these products are evolving
very rapidly and as their ability to

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:02.690
very rapidly and as their ability to
 

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:04.750
very rapidly and as their ability to
deliver nicotine improves they'll become

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:04.760
deliver nicotine improves they'll become
 

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.610
deliver nicotine improves they'll become
more appealing not just as acquitted for

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:06.620
more appealing not just as acquitted for
 

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:09.640
more appealing not just as acquitted for
smoker but also potentially for uptake

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:09.650
smoker but also potentially for uptake
 

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:11.980
smoker but also potentially for uptake
so we see lots of trying among kids not

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:11.990
so we see lots of trying among kids not
 

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.980
so we see lots of trying among kids not
a lot of regular use

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:12.990
a lot of regular use
 

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:14.870
a lot of regular use
how will that change if the product

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880
how will that change if the product
 

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.600
how will that change if the product
design changes so I now finish off by

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:17.610
design changes so I now finish off by
 

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:19.580
design changes so I now finish off by
just reinforcing what I think is the

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:19.590
just reinforcing what I think is the
 

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:20.500
just reinforcing what I think is the
importance of international

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:20.510
importance of international
 

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:23.180
importance of international
collaboration we have a series of

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:23.190
collaboration we have a series of
 

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:25.370
collaboration we have a series of
natural experiments playing out across

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:25.380
natural experiments playing out across
 

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:27.440
natural experiments playing out across
the world in very different regulatory

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:27.450
the world in very different regulatory
 

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:29.750
the world in very different regulatory
markets and this is an opportunity for

be thinking about this well we have to

00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:17.230
be thinking about this well we have to
 

00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:19.470
be thinking about this well we have to
think into in terms of harm reduction

00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:19.480
think into in terms of harm reduction
 

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:22.500
think into in terms of harm reduction
about what we're reducing harm from and

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:22.510
about what we're reducing harm from and
 

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:25.200
about what we're reducing harm from and
and with teens the the objective is to

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:25.210
and with teens the the objective is to
 

00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:28.590
and with teens the the objective is to
prevent initiation in the first place so

00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:28.600
prevent initiation in the first place so
 

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:31.050
prevent initiation in the first place so
so the harm reduction debate is not so

00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:31.060
so the harm reduction debate is not so
 

00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:33.410
so the harm reduction debate is not so
relevant as it is is the question of

00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:33.420
relevant as it is is the question of
 

00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:36.690
relevant as it is is the question of
preventing youth initiation and and that

00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:36.700
preventing youth initiation and and that
 

00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:38.730
preventing youth initiation and and that
the later weekend or that the longer we

00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:38.740
the later weekend or that the longer we
 

00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:40.620
the later weekend or that the longer we
can prevent youth initiation the later

00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:40.630
can prevent youth initiation the later
 

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:43.050
can prevent youth initiation the later
the age of initiation the less likely

00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:43.060
the age of initiation the less likely
 

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:46.260
the age of initiation the less likely
youth will be will will mature to become

youth will be will will mature to become
dependent users of tobacco products so I

00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:48.640
dependent users of tobacco products so I
 

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:51.080
dependent users of tobacco products so I
think that's an important strategy

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:51.090

there's there's clearly good news and
 

00:41:53.530 --> 00:41:55.890
there's there's clearly good news and
bad news in the CDC data and I think we

00:41:55.890 --> 00:41:55.900
bad news in the CDC data and I think we
 

00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:58.470
bad news in the CDC data and I think we
want to think very carefully about how

youth access or interest in e-cigarettes
 

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:07.050
youth access or interest in e-cigarettes
because we're concerned about the

00:42:07.050 --> 00:42:07.060
because we're concerned about the
 

00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:08.790
because we're concerned about the
potential for that to develop into other

00:51:24.250 --> 00:51:24.260
the use of the patch of the gum in other
 

00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:25.900
the use of the patch of the gum in other
words nicotine intake through the mouth

00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:25.910
words nicotine intake through the mouth
 

00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:27.400
words nicotine intake through the mouth
of the skin the same way that we do

00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:27.410
of the skin the same way that we do
 

00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:30.520
of the skin the same way that we do
through smoke and so I think the goal

00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:30.530
through smoke and so I think the goal
 

00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:32.590
through smoke and so I think the goal
needs to remain very much squarely

00:51:32.590 --> 00:51:32.600
needs to remain very much squarely
 

00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:35.170
needs to remain very much squarely
focused on denormalization of smoking

00:51:35.170 --> 00:51:35.180
focused on denormalization of smoking
 

00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:38.860
focused on denormalization of smoking
and to the extent that that we want to

00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:38.870
and to the extent that that we want to
 

00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:41.440
and to the extent that that we want to
think about how e-cigarettes and

00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:41.450
think about how e-cigarettes and
 

00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:43.870
think about how e-cigarettes and
vaporized nicotine is positioned well I

00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:43.880
vaporized nicotine is positioned well I
 

00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:45.490
vaporized nicotine is positioned well I
think that comes back to what we talked

00:51:45.490 --> 00:51:45.500
think that comes back to what we talked
 

00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:46.900
think that comes back to what we talked
about in terms of restrictions on

00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:46.910
about in terms of restrictions on
 

00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:49.600
about in terms of restrictions on
marketing and labeling so we've done

00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:49.610
marketing and labeling so we've done
 

00:51:49.610 --> 00:51:51.790
marketing and labeling so we've done
some work on that and it's marketing

00:51:51.790 --> 00:51:51.800
some work on that and it's marketing
 

00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:53.950
some work on that and it's marketing
advertising bands it's labeling of the

00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:53.960
advertising bands it's labeling of the
 

00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:55.810
advertising bands it's labeling of the
products themselves that very much

00:51:55.810 --> 00:51:55.820
products themselves that very much
 

00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:58.120
products themselves that very much
shapes the norm along with mass media

00:51:58.120 --> 00:51:58.130
shapes the norm along with mass media
 

00:51:58.130 --> 00:51:59.980
shapes the norm along with mass media
campaigns and so there's a possibility

00:51:59.980 --> 00:51:59.990
campaigns and so there's a possibility
 

00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:02.770
campaigns and so there's a possibility
to sort of shape the norm of smoking and

00:52:02.770 --> 00:52:02.780
to sort of shape the norm of smoking and
 

00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:04.840
to sort of shape the norm of smoking and
vaporized nicotine products in a

00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:04.850
vaporized nicotine products in a
 

00:52:04.850 --> 00:52:07.030
vaporized nicotine products in a
deliberate way and I think the debate is

00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:07.040
deliberate way and I think the debate is
 

00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:08.920
deliberate way and I think the debate is
going to be about what we want to do and

00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:08.930
going to be about what we want to do and
 

00:52:08.930 --> 00:52:10.780
going to be about what we want to do and
how we shape those products relative to

00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:10.790
how we shape those products relative to
 

00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:14.200
how we shape those products relative to
each other can I can i chime in I'd like

I do think the two critical regulatory

00:52:30.849 --> 00:52:30.859
I also think in regard to the speaker's
 

00:52:30.859 --> 00:52:33.849
I also think in regard to the speaker's
question what has made this issue so

00:52:33.849 --> 00:52:33.859
question what has made this issue so
 

00:52:33.859 --> 00:52:36.730
question what has made this issue so
difficult is the differentiation between

00:52:36.730 --> 00:52:36.740
difficult is the differentiation between
 

00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:39.880
difficult is the differentiation between
smoked or combusted tobacco products and

smoked or combusted tobacco products and
 

00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:43.450

other tobacco products I howard
mentioned it's just been a little over a

00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:45.440
mentioned it's just been a little over a
 

00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:47.319
mentioned it's just been a little over a
year since the release of the 50th

anniversary Surgeon General's report we
 

00:52:49.339 --> 00:52:50.710
anniversary Surgeon General's report we
seem to have forgotten one of the

00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:50.720
seem to have forgotten one of the
 

00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:52.630
seem to have forgotten one of the
principal messages that came out of that

00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:52.640
principal messages that came out of that
 

00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:55.740
principal messages that came out of that
report which is that the enemy here is

report which is that the enemy here is
 

00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:58.589

combusted tobacco and we need to focus

00:52:58.589 --> 00:52:58.599
combusted tobacco and we need to focus
 

00:52:58.599 --> 00:53:02.349
combusted tobacco and we need to focus
laser-like on combusted tobacco that's

00:53:02.349 --> 00:53:02.359
laser-like on combusted tobacco that's
 

00:53:02.359 --> 00:53:05.259
laser-like on combusted tobacco that's
not to say that oral tobacco use in some

00:53:05.259 --> 00:53:05.269
not to say that oral tobacco use in some
 

00:53:05.269 --> 00:53:06.789
not to say that oral tobacco use in some
parts of the world like India and the

00:53:06.789 --> 00:53:06.799
parts of the world like India and the
 

00:53:06.799 --> 00:53:10.089
parts of the world like India and the
Sudan is not a very serious problem but

00:53:10.089 --> 00:53:10.099
Sudan is not a very serious problem but
 

00:53:10.099 --> 00:53:13.599
Sudan is not a very serious problem but
in some countries like Sweden it may

00:53:13.599 --> 00:53:13.609
in some countries like Sweden it may
 

00:53:13.609 --> 00:53:15.430
in some countries like Sweden it may
have been part of the solution of the

00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:15.440
have been part of the solution of the
 

00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:19.359
have been part of the solution of the
tobacco disease problem so snus which is

00:53:19.359 --> 00:53:19.369
tobacco disease problem so snus which is
 

00:53:19.369 --> 00:53:21.759
tobacco disease problem so snus which is
a form of smokeless tobacco that's been

00:53:21.759 --> 00:53:21.769
a form of smokeless tobacco that's been
 

00:53:21.769 --> 00:53:23.890
a form of smokeless tobacco that's been
used for four decades or more by males

00:53:23.890 --> 00:53:23.900
used for four decades or more by males
 

00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:26.740
used for four decades or more by males
in Sweden has led to the finding that

00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:26.750
in Sweden has led to the finding that
 

00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:29.829
in Sweden has led to the finding that
this will use tobacco about the same

00:53:29.829 --> 00:53:29.839
this will use tobacco about the same
 

00:53:29.839 --> 00:53:32.200
this will use tobacco about the same
levels as other European countries but

00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:32.210
levels as other European countries but
 

00:53:32.210 --> 00:53:35.200
levels as other European countries but
they don't smoke much they use snus and

00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:35.210
they don't smoke much they use snus and
 

00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:37.480
they don't smoke much they use snus and
if you look at their rates of death from

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:37.490
if you look at their rates of death from
 

00:53:37.490 --> 00:53:40.630
if you look at their rates of death from
one cancer tobacco-related heart disease

00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:40.640
one cancer tobacco-related heart disease
 

00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:42.880
one cancer tobacco-related heart disease
overall mortality associated with

overall mortality associated with
 

00:53:42.890 --> 00:53:45.400
overall mortality associated with
tobacco they are dramatically lower than

00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:45.410
tobacco they are dramatically lower than
 

00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:47.769
tobacco they are dramatically lower than
the second best country in each of those

00:53:47.769 --> 00:53:47.779
the second best country in each of those
 

00:53:47.779 --> 00:53:50.440
the second best country in each of those
categories in all of the European Union

00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:50.450
categories in all of the European Union
 

00:53:50.450 --> 00:53:53.620
categories in all of the European Union
so this is a complicated issue because

00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:53.630
so this is a complicated issue because
 

00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:55.450
so this is a complicated issue because
it's not a matter of I mean we can waive

00:53:55.450 --> 00:53:55.460
it's not a matter of I mean we can waive
 

00:53:55.460 --> 00:53:56.710
it's not a matter of I mean we can waive
our hand to say let's get rid of all

00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:56.720
our hand to say let's get rid of all
 

00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:58.960
our hand to say let's get rid of all
tobacco I think everybody in public

it's not about to go away overnight and
 

00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:09.370
it's not about to go away overnight and
we just need to keep that much one more

00:54:09.370 --> 00:54:09.380
we just need to keep that much one more
 

00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:10.690
we just need to keep that much one more
thing I'd to say is very quickly because

thing I'd to say is very quickly because
 

00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:12.130
thing I'd to say is very quickly because
I think this is important for people to

I think this is important for people to
 

00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:14.769
I think this is important for people to
recognize a colleague David Mendes and I

recognize a colleague David Mendes and I
 

00:54:14.779 --> 00:54:17.259
recognize a colleague David Mendes and I
have a model simulation model by which

00:54:17.259 --> 00:54:17.269
have a model simulation model by which
 

00:54:17.269 --> 00:54:19.480
have a model simulation model by which
we've been projecting smoking prevalence

00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:19.490
we've been projecting smoking prevalence
 

00:54:19.490 --> 00:54:21.490
we've been projecting smoking prevalence
in the United States since the mid-1990s

in the United States since the mid-1990s
the model has been extremely accurate

00:54:24.519 --> 00:54:24.529
the model has been extremely accurate
 

00:54:24.529 --> 00:54:26.920
the model has been extremely accurate
through the year 2010 the last time we

through the year 2010 the last time we
 

00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:29.470
through the year 2010 the last time we
checked uh if we don't do anything

00:54:29.470 --> 00:54:29.480
checked uh if we don't do anything
 

00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:32.069

is plausible that we will have smoking

00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:34.880
is plausible that we will have smoking
 

00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:37.210
is plausible that we will have smoking

United States in the year 2050 that's
 

00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:43.880

frightening prospect that's why we've

00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:43.890
frightening prospect that's why we've
 

00:54:43.890 --> 00:54:45.079
frightening prospect that's why we've
got to start thinking about these

00:54:45.079 --> 00:54:45.089
got to start thinking about these
 

00:54:45.089 --> 00:54:47.150
got to start thinking about these
endgame notions and the subtleties of

don't think we have time but there are a

don't think we have time but there are a
lot of questions online i encourage

lot of questions online i encourage
 

00:54:56.309 --> 00:54:58.279
lot of questions online i encourage
everyone to go on because i know we want
