Hi, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government
and Politics. As fans of our series know,

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.430
here at Crash Course we believe in hierarchy.
First at the top you got me, then there's

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.580
John Green, then Stan, then Brandon, then
Zulaiha, then a bunch of independent contractors

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.789
- wait I'm an independent contractor. But
I'm still at the top! Anyway then the rest

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.350
of it's turtles all the way down. 'Cept at
the bottom. There's an eagle.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.410
Anyway, it's the strict adherence to hierarchy
that makes CC HQ run like a well-oiled machine.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.290
The same can be said for the U.S. court system.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:40.230
[Theme Music]

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.719
As you probably remember, because you're a
smart rememberer of things, the American court

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.839
system is hierarchical which means any discussion of it
cries out for a visual representation. Thought Bubble!

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.540
Like Drake, we'll start from the bottom. The
trial courts have original jurisdiction. When

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:56.199
you realize there are 50 states, each with
its own court system, it shouldn't be a surprise

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.799
that the vast majority of cases start out
in state courts. Of course most cases never

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:03.309
get to court at all. The vast majority of
disputes, criminal and civil, are settled

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.129
outside of court. How's that for efficiency.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.900
On the federal side, the trial courts are
the U.S. district courts. There are 94 of

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.720
them with 663 judges, more or less. Sometimes
in civil cases, a plaintiff, the person bringing

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.230
the case, will have a choice of whether to
bring that case in state or federal court.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.920
But you can only start in the district courts
if your case meets certain important criteria.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.290
Almost all criminal cases start in state courts.
So if you don't like the result in a trial

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.160
court, and you have a reasonable claim that
there was something procedurally wrong with

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.940
the case or the way the law was applied, you
can bring an appeal.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.050
Notice that if you start in state courts,
you usually have more chances for appeal because

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.850
most states have two levels of appellate courts,
and the federal system has one. Appeals courts

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.420
can refuse to hear appeals, and if they do,
you're done. One thing to remember: the loser

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.520
can always try to appeal, even if that loser
was of the state that failed in its prosecution.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.460
Federal appeals courts are called circuit
courts, and there are 12 of them distributed

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.640
regionally throughout the U.S.. You might
guess if the region where your case is heard

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.340
matters, and you'd be right! Judges in the
9th circuit, which includes California and

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.790
Oregon, tend to be more liberal than judges
in the 5th circuit.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.460
Federal appeals are usually heard by panels
of three judges while trials in the district

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.240
court are before a single judge. There are
four scenarios where the federal courts have

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.810
original jurisdiction, and in all cases they
must be brought in a district court.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.890
They are:
Cases where the law at issue is a federal

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.459
law like a claim against Obamacare.
Cases involving treaties which are by definition

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.389
federal laws. These are pretty rare and rarely
interesting.

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:19.219
Cases involving the U.S. Constitution. For
example a case concerning freedom of religion.

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:21.709
And cases where the U.S. government is a party
to the litigation.

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.930
The other type of case that can go in a federal
court is one involving more than one state

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.260
where there's more than 70,000 dollars at
issue. This make sense because if the parties

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.329
in dispute are in different states, they might
not even agree where to have the trial, and

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:33.999
federal judges are supposed to be more impartial
than state judges.

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:36.799
Thanks Thought Bubble. So thoughtful. So bubbly.

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.840
If you read the news and pay attention to
legal cases, most of what you see are lower

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.219
court decisions. At least until the spring
when the supreme court starts handing down

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:45.680
decisions. These are the ones that tend to
make it into the history books and that you

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.680
may have even heard of. But how does a
case get to the supreme court, Craig?

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.319
Well, I will answer that for you. That's my job.

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.049
Most of the time, the supreme court has appellate
jurisdiction. In fact, it's the final court

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.909
of appeals. If you lose there, you really
really lost. When the court hears a case it's

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:02.489
called judicial review. There are however
circumstances when the supreme court has original

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.029
jurisdiction and can act like a trial court.
So it's a good thing that most of the justices

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:09.930
are in fact lawyers. Although there's no constitutional
requirement that they need to be.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.870
The court has original jurisdiction in cases
between the U.S. and a state, cases between

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.779
two or more states, cases involving foreign
ministers or ambassadors, and cases brought

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:21.340
by citizens of one state against citizens
of another state or against a foreign country.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.590
What do these cases have in common? The main
thing is that you can't imagine there being

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.549
a single state where they could happen. This
is especially true in cases involving foreign officials.

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.159
And then there are my favorite supreme court
cases - crimes committed on the high seas.

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:35.999
That's right -- the supreme court can exercise
original jurisdiction over pirates! This is

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:39.980
not as weird as it sounds because crimes on
the high seas by definition have not happened

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.760
in any state, so where are you gonna have
the trial?

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.870
But most of the time, cases that make it to
the supreme court are there on appeal. In

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.720
order for the court to exercise its appellate
jurisdiction, the case must raise a federal question.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.420
For example one involving due process
or equal protection, or an important federal statute.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.460
Statute! If you don't know what those
terms mean, don't worry. We'll get to them.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.640
Here's the thing though: the supreme court
doesn't hear a lot of cases, it doesn't want to.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.099
And I don't want to either! I understand!
They also can't. And it's not just because

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:07.449
most of the justices are kind of old, it's
because there are only nine of them, and they

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:09.760
get requests to review about 8,000 cases a
year.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.069
Out of these they actually hand down about
80 decisions. So they have decision rules

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:15.989
to weed out the cases that they don't want
to hear. The first one is there has to be

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.420
a case or controversy, which means that you
can't request the court to review whether

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.320
or not a law is unconstitutional before it has gone
into effect. There has to be an actual injury first.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.220
Another way of saying this is that the supreme
court will not issue advisory opinions, speculating

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.280
in whether or not a law might violate the
constitution.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.930
The second hurdle a potential supreme court
litigant has to get over is called standing.

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.030
Huh! That sounds terrible. I wouldn't want
to be standing. No, this means that in order

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.060
to bring a case, the parties must have a substantial
stake in the outcome, which usually means

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.590
an actual injury. Lack of standing is one
reason that the court has refused cases about

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.040
same sex marriage brought by opposite sex
married people.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.380
The court will also refuse to hear cases that
is moot. Mootness, which is a real word I promise,

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.440
I'm reading it on a teleprompter, means that
the case no longer requires a resolution.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.340
Say because one of the parties is dead. The
flipside of mootness is ripeness. If a potential

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.760
injury has yet to occur, the case is not ripe.
It's like a hard avocado.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.220
Your guacamole...just not going to be very good.

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.620
It's best not to be too anxious about bringing your case.
Most of the time you can wait, except in cases like

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.200
Bush v Gore, where we kind of needed a new outcome
so a new president could move into the White House.

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.060
There's also a vague decision rule called
the political question doctrine. In some cases

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.860
the court would rather let the executive or legislative
branch handle the issue and not get involved.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.960
There are certain cases that the court would
almost always take, even though all things

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.350
being equal, they'd rather not. When the circuit
courts have reached different or conflicting

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.860
conclusions on the same issue, what's known
as a circuit split, the court will usually

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.340
hear the case to resolve the confusion. The
court will also almost always hear a case

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.970
where the federal government itself initiated
the appeal.

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.310
Finally the supreme court will usually take
a case that has a clear constitutional question

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.190
like one involving freedom of speech or religion,
although there are sometimes constitutional

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.710
issues that they feel are settled, or they
just don't want to deal with.

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.290
For a long time, for example, the court
didn't hear gun control cases,

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.640
and nowadays they don't usually take obscenity cases.

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.060
Okay so that's the structure of the court
system and how a case does, or usually doesn't,

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.740
make it to the supreme court. But what we
haven't really discussed is what happens when

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.170
a case does make it to the supreme court.
We'll show you that next time when we take

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:09.060
a shortcut to the supreme court by suing the
ambassador to Switzerland for making such

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.960
delicious chocolate. It's making me unhealthy.
Thanks for watching, see ya next time.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.000
We're not actually going to sue Switzerland.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.150
