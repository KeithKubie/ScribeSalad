00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.720
When we square both sides of the equation, we get 2x plus 6 on the left and x

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.850
squared minus 2x plus 1 on the right. Great work if you found these two parts.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.154
We know a square undoes the square root, so we would be left with this

00:00:14.154 --> 00:00:19.850
expression on the left. For the right-hand side, we want to square x minus 1.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:25.000
This means we'll multiply x minus 1 by itself. When we do that, we will get the

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.272
polynomial x squared minus 2x plus 1. Remember this is really a perfect square

00:00:30.272 --> 00:00:35.720
so it follows the pattern a squared minus 2ab plus b squared. We can use that

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.040
pattern to multiply this more quickly.
