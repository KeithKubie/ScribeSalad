00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.460
One example, where SDN can provide huge wins, is in the data center. A

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.800
data center, typically consists of many racks

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.614
of servers. And any particular cluster might

00:00:12.614 --> 00:00:18.140
have, as many as 20,000 servers. Assuming that each one of these servers can

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.340
run about 200 virtual machines. That's 400,000

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.810
virtual machines in a cluster. A significant

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.220
problem is provisioning or migrating these

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.290
virtual machines in response to varying

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:39.070
traffic loads. SDN solves this problem by programming the switch state from a

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.200
central database. So supposing, I have

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.630
two virtual machines within the data center

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.200
that needs to communicate with one

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.890
another. The forwarding state in the switches,

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.700
in the data center ensures that traffic is forwarded correctly. If we need to

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.560
provision additional virtual machines. Or migrate a

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.430
virtual machine from one server to another in

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.459
the data center, the state in these

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:08.930
switches must be updated. Updating the state in

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.200
this fashion is much easier to do,

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.290
from a central controller or a central database,

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.920
facilitating. This type of Virtual Machine Migration

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.470
in the data center is one of

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.580
the early killer apps of software-defined networking.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.870
This type of migration is also made

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:34.400
easier by the fact that the servers are addressed with Layer two Addressing. And

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.610
the entire data center Looks like a flat layer two topology. What this means,

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:47.730
is that a server can be migrated from one portion of the data center to another

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.830
without requiring the virtual machine to obtain new

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.360
addresses. All that needs to happen for forwarding to

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.160
work ,is the state of these switches. Needs

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.710
to be updated. The task of updating switch

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.200
date in this fashion is very easy to

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.510
do, when the control and data plans are separate.
