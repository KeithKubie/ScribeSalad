My name is John Reynolds,

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:08.401 line:0%
but my aunt's boyfriends
call me J-Ball Pizza Ass.

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:10.370 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
And why am I running
for town mayor?

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.539 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
Let's just say I grew up
with 33 brother and sisters,

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:14.574 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
and my dad's a milkman

Maybe.

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:17.677 line:0%
You know what I'm talkin'
about? (nerdy laughing)

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:19.813
- [John] Nice.

00:01:19.813 --> 00:01:21.548
- The only thing that
sucks about being buff,

00:01:21.548 --> 00:01:23.083
is you just can't
fit into stuff.

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:25.051
I can't fit under
this dang melch!

00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:26.086
Can't fit into this!

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:27.287
Can't fit into this thing!

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:29.856
I can't even fit down
the dang sidewalk!

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:31.991 align:start size:81% position:19%
But I can smash
your freakin' car!

(dinging)

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:37.497
- One thing's for sure.

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:39.099
I'm most definitely
not running for mayor

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:41.768 align:start size:84% position:16%
to impress my
girlfriend, Jessica.

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:43.903 align:start size:84% position:16%
- What I bring to
the table is simple.

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:47.140
I'm rich, I'm strong,
and I'm nasty as hell.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.943
I can get anything I want.

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:52.545
Hey kid, how 'bout you let
me get that ice cream cone?

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:53.546
- No, mister.

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:56.216
(ominous music)

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.619
- This fuckin' sucks.

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:00.887
You ever pull some
shit like that again,

00:02:00.887 --> 00:02:02.622
I'ma make one phone call,

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:04.457
chop your fuckin'
head off, alright?

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:06.826 align:start size:84% position:16%

(dinging)

00:02:08.261 --> 00:02:10.029 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
- Also, I wouldn't be caught
dead running for mayor

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:11.865 align:start size:84% position:16%
to impress my
girlfriend, Jessica.

00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:14.901

00:02:22.842 --> 00:02:24.210
- Ooowahahaha!

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.880 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Onomatopoeia,
malapropisms, xylophone.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.782
These are just some of
the words that I know.

00:02:29.782 --> 00:02:31.417
Where did I go to school?

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:33.520
Let's just say it's called
Rock &amp; Roll Middle School.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.988
(nerdy laughing)

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:37.857
Did I mention that my dad
owns a Ruby Thursdays?

00:02:37.857 --> 00:02:39.592
(nerdy laughing) Know
what I'm talkin' about?

00:02:39.592 --> 00:02:40.426

00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:44.597
just to impress my
girlfriend, Jessica.

00:02:44.597 --> 00:02:48.001
(romantic music)

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:52.572
Wow, girlfriend. (chuckling)

00:02:52.572 --> 00:02:54.541
Sounds weird to say.

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:56.075
(nerdy laughing)

00:02:56.075 --> 00:02:56.910
Nice.

(romantic music)

00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:05.585 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [All] Oh nice, there
goes Jessica now!

00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:06.452
- Hey babe.

00:03:06.452 --> 00:03:07.887
Here's your cream.

00:03:07.887 --> 00:03:10.657

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:13.359
Ohh!

00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:15.828

(depressing music)

00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:27.040

Mayor DeBibbity Beepo wins
in an uncontested landslide.

Although there were
three other applicants,

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:34.914
their paperwork was rejected,

00:03:34.914 --> 00:03:37.317
due to being sticky and folded.

00:03:37.317 --> 00:03:40.320 align:start size:97% position:3%
These are the applicants
walking right behind me now,

00:03:42.388 --> 00:03:45.258 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
And I'm still on camera
and still talking.

I hope you're enjoying
watching this newscast,

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.329
as much as I am giving it,

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.465 align:start size:84% position:16%
