Speaker 1:          00:06          Like a boss

Speaker 2:          00:13          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:13          you know, it's like the next thing that was coming up was, uh, somebody up there likes me, which I'd always heard of when I was growing up. And then once I saw it was Paul Newman, I was like, all right, I'm going to watch it. And it was him playing out rocky Graziano the rocky Graziano story.

Speaker 2:          00:28          Oh boy. They just try to fool you got to lousy Coptic. I'm gonna land my [inaudible], but I don't leave me alone. Leave me alone. Why don't you give up on me? My [inaudible] will be everybody else knows. Why don't you give up on me?

Speaker 1:          00:47          And, um, and I literally forget what I was talking. Oh, that's right. That's right. So it just got me on this, this, this Paul Newman thing. And you know what's funny is, uh, this, this thing, actually, Steve McQueen is in that movie for fucking two seconds.

Speaker 2:          01:04          Okay. What do you say? Fight out? Come on. Get on. Huh?

Speaker 1:          01:12          And uh, it's right as, uh, Graziani was getting out of some fucking, uh, you know, juvenile detention home that he fucking escapes. So He's going around the neighborhood, tapping all these guys, all this tough guy, friends on the shoulders.

Speaker 2:          01:24          Hey Shorty degree, come on buddy boy, we got work to do. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:36          to be like, Hey I'm back in the neighborhood. And all of them turn around like who the fuck is this guy? Right? Cause cause it Tufts street kids so fucking a fucking Steve McQueen is shooting pool. The rocky taps him on the shoulder and he fucking turns around with a knife out just two seconds and then he realizes it's reads like it's rocky. He's like, hey rocky. And he does this stupid fucking thing with his hand that I don't know who fucking,

Speaker 1:          02:06          there's certain things in movies that the first guy who plays that guy does and then it's this weird fucking thing where every other actor after it starts fucking doing it and you know, nobody ever did it. Who's actually the guy that they're playing. But then it's done enough in fucking movies that the people who are actually that guy, then they start fucking doing it. And that's when it becomes a circle. And you don't know who the fuck it is. It's this fucking thing like, uh, it's almost like, say you were getting a mannequin right and you wanted to dry off your nails and you do just see exec a rocky and he's doing this stupid fucking thing with his hand. Um, I dunno, I'm going a really long way here to tell you what I really want to tell you. But like one of my favorite things is to watch actors during that era playing Tufts street kids. Um, like it's just, it's fucking cringeworthy that fucking movie that Marlon Brando did. Oh, he's on the motorcycle. What the fuck was that one called? It's not the wild bunch. That was a cowboy movie. Rebel without a cot. Now that's James Dean. I can't remember, but just the, the have to sit there and watch that shit. Um, how fucking brutal it is that west side story, which I don't think I've ever seen. I'm just gonna throw that in there cause I need three of them. Um,

Speaker 2:          03:28          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          03:29          how can you ask me to go on a courthouse building that happens to be what people get married? Well, being in courthouse just makes me be uncomfortable. Stuff on the please. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          03:39          just tell me you don't love [inaudible].
