1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,590
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and
it's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05,591 --> 00:00:08,420
Just before Friday, Monday
morning podcast. And

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,290
ahhh

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,420
just checking in on you.
Just checking in on you.

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,480
I'm actually recording this
one's day before the game.

6
00:00:17,481 --> 00:00:19,910
Seven Jeff fucking with Ya.

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,720
It's Thursday. I watched the game.
I know what happened. All right.

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,940
I got to say congratulations to the Saint
Louis Blues on your first Stanley Cup

9
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:36,800
Championship. Ever avenge Jake,
your mother's Day's loss was it

10
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,920
May 13th, 1970 something like that.
40 fucking nine years later. Um,

11
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:43,910
I'm not gonna lie to you.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,810
I had a smile on my face
when I was watching all those
St Louis Blues fans going

13
00:00:47,811 --> 00:00:48,380
crazy.

14
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:52,910
And one of my favorite things
in the world is watching,

15
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,740
uh, a franchise that hasn't
won it in forever when it,

16
00:00:57,741 --> 00:01:00,440
but I feel like I got fucked
over because they beat my team,

17
00:01:00,441 --> 00:01:02,930
so I couldn't fully enjoy it
the same way. Like I, you know,

18
00:01:02,931 --> 00:01:06,240
I was rooting for the eagles,
you know, to win a Superbowl.

19
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,260
I just didn't want him to beat the
Patriots. So both of those, you know,

20
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,930
I felt like I would've enjoyed way more,

21
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,220
obviously if they weren't beating my
team. But like Jesus Christ, hats off to

22
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,520
the Saint Louis Blues Organizations, they
played a fucking masterful game seven.

23
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:27,530
It was such a great series where it
was really just the speed of the Bruins

24
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:31,730
versus this physical, we'll have
the blues, what was going to win.

25
00:01:31,731 --> 00:01:36,290
And I got to say, oh, freckles kind
of called it, did he not, did he not?

26
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:37,371
I said,

27
00:01:37,371 --> 00:01:42,371
the way to beat the blues is you got
a score first and pull him out of that

28
00:01:43,491 --> 00:01:47,590
fucking trap defense that
they were playing, Eh,

29
00:01:47,591 --> 00:01:49,730
which would open up the ice for our speed.

30
00:01:49,731 --> 00:01:53,510
And that's what happened in game
like game three in game six.

31
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,860
Um, and when they went up one to
nothing, and I was like, fuck, we need,

32
00:01:57,861 --> 00:02:02,120
we need to get this next goal. We need to
get this next goal. We can't have them.

33
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,330
We can't have them up to,
oh,

34
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:10,070
I mean I haven't seen the trap defense
played that well since the boring ass New

35
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,860
Jersey devils one,
three cups.

36
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:16,910
Some of the worst hockey I've ever seen
in my life as far as excitement went.

37
00:02:16,911 --> 00:02:21,911
But what I loved about the way the blues
played it was as much as I was kind of

38
00:02:22,251 --> 00:02:23,600
being a fucking cunt about it,

39
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:28,250
I actually in the end really
enjoyed the way they played. Um,

40
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,030
playing outside the lines a little bit,
but that is playoff hockey. And you know,

41
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,730
I lose looking up some hockey
stats before game seven.

42
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,660
The Bruins back in the day when the
Canadians would always be this, you know,

43
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,270
Don Cherry was our coach and
it's something I read was just,

44
00:02:41,271 --> 00:02:45,710
he told him to have their sticks up high
around Gila floor and we still didn't

45
00:02:45,711 --> 00:02:48,980
beat and Mckela Flora's whole fucking
head was swollen and cut up by the end of

46
00:02:48,981 --> 00:02:50,750
this series.
So we've done shit like that.

47
00:02:50,751 --> 00:02:55,751
So I would be a real fucking pansy here
if I was to complain about some of the

48
00:02:56,181 --> 00:03:00,310
rougher stuff. And just
the bottom line was we, um,

49
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,440
I set it, dude. I said,

50
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:05,290
it said you don't want to go seven games
with this team because you're going to

51
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:08,740
be to beat up by the end. You
know, if you're the finesse team,

52
00:03:08,741 --> 00:03:12,310
you gotta he gotta win it and five or
six or they're just going to weigh you

53
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:15,610
down. The way I saw him were down in San
Jose, which is exactly what they did.

54
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,120
And uh,
I was too hard on Billington.

55
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,310
I said he was astoundingly mediocre.

56
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,270
I was as hard on him is they have
been overly complimenting him.

57
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:28,900
All right? First Rookie
goaltenders I have a good 68 games.

58
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:33,901
It's like Patrick while only one 15
and 1986 because you could only win 15.

59
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,950
All right. The first round
was best three out of five.

60
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,790
So it's not his fault that he couldn't
have beat their ass and other fucking

61
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,950
game. Um, not to mention he won the cons.

62
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,030
My thing had a 1.92 goals against average.

63
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:54,040
My thing about Billington was this and
he had four fucking stand on your head

64
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:58,420
saves in a game seven so you can
never take that away from that guy.

65
00:03:58,421 --> 00:04:03,421
But that guy was definitely a
different goal tender when he was down.

66
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,940
Okay.
When we win game six,

67
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:11,800
when we were actually fucking got a little
physical and we went up, you know, we,

68
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:16,330
we, we went up a goal,
you know, the same thing.

69
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:17,170
We didn't gain three.

70
00:04:17,171 --> 00:04:19,930
All of a sudden the guy's given up five
goals that game and getting pulled out

71
00:04:19,931 --> 00:04:23,350
of one game.
So last night what I was watching,

72
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,540
the problem that we were having,

73
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,600
and I've never seen a team for
check as well as the blue, uh,

74
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,030
and in recent memory
is the St Louis Blues.

75
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:34,600
What they kept talking
about their goaltender it,

76
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,300
I don't know what the fucking
game they were watching,

77
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:41,560
what the game was between
the goaltenders and like,

78
00:04:41,561 --> 00:04:43,750
have you ever seen a fucking team?
Like

79
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,380
they stop like every fucking past we made.

80
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,580
There was like every time a Bruin
had a puck there was like a,

81
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:53,590
there was like a clock
thousand 1000 to get rid of it,

82
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:56,830
get rid of it or they would just going
to come up and just physically take it

83
00:04:56,831 --> 00:05:01,600
away from you. We had the amount of
passes that we would like through the air,

84
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:05,020
like saucer pass try to do and they
would just bat it down out of the air.

85
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,770
Like they had like a fucking, I dunno,
like they had a goaltender's stick.

86
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,650
It was unbelievable how fucking
amazing they were at that.

87
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,150
I'm not good with the names cause I got
a kid now and I got to watch the game

88
00:05:16,151 --> 00:05:19,630
with the fucking sound out.
But that number nine on the blues,

89
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:22,690
I can't remember what your first or
second goal and we, I think crazy.

90
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,640
Somebody had the puck and
he just knocked him down,

91
00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:29,610
kept in in our zone and I was like,
and then you know, they're passionate,

92
00:05:29,611 --> 00:05:31,750
they're passing that keeping it
in the zone the whole time ago.

93
00:05:31,751 --> 00:05:34,570
If they score here, then that number
nine should get a fucking assist.

94
00:05:34,571 --> 00:05:37,900
And sure enough they ended up scoring
I think on the tip shot or I can't

95
00:05:37,901 --> 00:05:38,200
remember.

96
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:43,090
It was so sort of the partial breakaway
backhander that guy got by Tuco. Um,

97
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,940
but the big thing was to beat them.

98
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:49,840
You had to go up cause when you went up
then Billington came back down to earth

99
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:53,980
and the problem last night as we got down
and we got down early and then he got

100
00:05:53,981 --> 00:05:57,950
to stay behind the cushy confines of the
way they were playing that trap defense

101
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,870
and we did not have a power forward
was what was lacking on our team.

102
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:07,520
We needed a guy in the slot taken the
punishment and we were to beat up and just

103
00:06:07,521 --> 00:06:08,870
didn't have that fucking guy.

104
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,270
So what was happening is when we got
into their offensive zone, if you want,

105
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:17,150
we watched the game the amount of times
we had the puck in a good position and

106
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:19,400
we would pass all the way to
the other side of the ice,

107
00:06:19,401 --> 00:06:23,930
go wing to wing and an NHL goaltender.
That's all day to go from post to post.

108
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:28,520
And we just didn't get any traffic in
front. And too many of our shots from,

109
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:32,330
we're from out near the Blue Line
where he had a wide open look. I mean,

110
00:06:32,331 --> 00:06:35,410
by the time we finally got traffic
out in front and scored on him,

111
00:06:35,411 --> 00:06:37,010
it took us six on five.

112
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:42,260
We had to have an extra guy so somebody
could stand out in front. And, um,

113
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,650
I dunno,
I love the blues aggressive style,

114
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,470
the way that they played and um,

115
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,680
and they knocked us on our ass and
we have to get bigger and stronger.

116
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,940
Congratulations that Bruins.

117
00:06:52,941 --> 00:06:57,260
They went way further this year than
I thought they were going to. Um,

118
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:59,960
you know, we definitely got it. You know,

119
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:04,220
we got rid of too many like Sean Thorton's
and Luke chichis and Adam McQuaids

120
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,340
where we couldn't hit him back.
And that was really,

121
00:07:07,341 --> 00:07:10,760
really hard to watch as a Bruins fan
because I've never seen us get physically

122
00:07:10,761 --> 00:07:15,470
dominated like that. Um, but, uh,

123
00:07:15,471 --> 00:07:18,170
I dunno. I Dunno. I Dunno.

124
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,750
It kinda ended up going the way
I thought I was going to go.

125
00:07:20,751 --> 00:07:25,751
And I was honest the other day when I
said I had absolutely no feeling on which

126
00:07:26,151 --> 00:07:30,200
way it was going to go in game seven,
which I don't know how you could,

127
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:36,010
because if you watch the Bruins and
game won a game three and games six,

128
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,160
you would think that the
blues couldn't play with us.

129
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:45,490
And then if you watch the Bruins
end game fucking two, four,

130
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,190
five and seven, you would've
thought we would've got swept.

131
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,830
It was such a fucking
weird series where it was,

132
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,660
it was almost like just whoever got out
front first like that was it and the

133
00:07:56,661 --> 00:08:00,450
game was going to be played the
way they played it. You know, if,

134
00:08:00,451 --> 00:08:01,820
if the Bruins got out front,

135
00:08:01,821 --> 00:08:05,690
it was going to be a speed game and we
were going to win in Billington was going

136
00:08:05,691 --> 00:08:10,160
to let up four or five fucking
goals or they got out front and,

137
00:08:10,161 --> 00:08:13,730
and fucking, it was just going to
be this physical game and we were,

138
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:18,950
we were going to play 80% of the game
in our, in our own fucking end. But,

139
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,340
um, I don't know. I'll
tell you this though.

140
00:08:22,341 --> 00:08:25,100
That's going to be a hell of a party on,
on uh,

141
00:08:25,101 --> 00:08:29,120
on Saturday down there in St Louis. You
guys totally deserve it. We're really,

142
00:08:29,121 --> 00:08:31,160
at the end of the day,
we're the better team.

143
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,160
I'm being a little cunty with your
goaltender and it has nothing that,

144
00:08:34,161 --> 00:08:35,690
this isn't a personal attack on the guy.

145
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:40,930
I'm just so fucking sick of like
sports casters in sports networks,

146
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:47,380
the way they spew out stats with no sort
of historical perspective is the same

147
00:08:49,131 --> 00:08:50,750
way a politician,
you know,

148
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,860
we'll fudge numbers and shit to make
this guy doesn't like babies. You know,

149
00:08:55,861 --> 00:08:59,310
he voted no on this fucking thing and
they don't look at what's attached to the

150
00:08:59,311 --> 00:09:01,560
fucking bill as to why
this person voted no.

151
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,780
Like this fucking horse shit where it's
just like this guy just had more wins

152
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,700
than Ken Dryden. It's like we can
drive and play and I think you needed,

153
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,673
he needed eight.

154
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:13,110
There was only two rounds of the playoffs
or you'd be watching like major league

155
00:09:13,111 --> 00:09:14,600
baseball and be like,
I'll tell her,

156
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:19,790
here's a stat that just came in so
and so just pass babe Ruth the salt.

157
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,960
And the Swat for most
postseason play offs.

158
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:29,250
It's like there,
they're back in Babe Ruth played.

159
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,850
It was like whoever had the most wins
in the American league that was winning

160
00:09:32,851 --> 00:09:36,300
the pennant. There was no play off. You
just immediately went to the world series.

161
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:41,490
So the best you could do is
play seven games in a year.

162
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,500
So now you could play, what is it?
The first round is the best of five.

163
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,490
You can play five and another four.

164
00:09:48,491 --> 00:09:52,110
You play 19 fucking games in one year now,

165
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,440
so obviously you're going to start
passing these guys sit down and say, hey,

166
00:09:55,441 --> 00:09:57,390
you know what I mean? He's
who's getting, oh, I'm April.

167
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:01,200
There's a reason why we're all sitting
there, right? Oh, hey, this kid right now,

168
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,860
he's got, I bet he's pinching
himself, seen his name up,

169
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:07,290
playing against eight fucker
guard to attack attack. It's just,

170
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:10,650
I don't understand that.
It's just like, well,

171
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:15,240
obviously if somebody is going to play
three times as many games potentially

172
00:10:15,241 --> 00:10:16,950
every fucking year of their career,

173
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:21,360
they're going to start passing some
fucking amazing people. You know,

174
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,170
like Martin brought dirt.
My main memory of this hall of fame,

175
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:28,050
great goaltender was him stopping,

176
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,480
dumping chase passes behind his
fucking net. You don't have,

177
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,150
the best I saw was Patrick Wa.
That's the best I ever fucking soft.

178
00:10:36,151 --> 00:10:40,200
So that's why being a bit of a cunt,
being a bit of a con,

179
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:44,130
it definitely fucking, um, you
know, it was fucking hilarious.

180
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,580
As I watched the game and a cigar bar,
I was so fucking sad when I left.

181
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:51,510
I forgot my credit card. I've got to
go back and get that today. But, um,

182
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:56,610
I, uh, I was in there. I'm in New York.

183
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:00,480
Nobody gave a shit about the fucking game.
I had to tell him to turn the game on.

184
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:05,400
And when the blues scored the first time

185
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:12,150
on the deflection,
the insult to injury was,

186
00:11:12,151 --> 00:11:14,730
I was sitting there and somebody
just goes, oh, did they just score?

187
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:18,390
And then he's watched the
replay. He goes, Ooh, a ricochet.

188
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:26,400
It's just like, oh my
God. Oh, ricochet. Okay.

189
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,320
Um, anyways, but, uh,

190
00:11:31,321 --> 00:11:34,200
and then the ones in New York fans
realized that I was rooting for Boston.

191
00:11:34,201 --> 00:11:36,660
They started giving me shit
and I fucking destroyed them.

192
00:11:36,661 --> 00:11:39,120
And then they all had to shut the
fuck up because they got nothing.

193
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,180
They got nothing. They got
fucking 97 fucking t. What do,

194
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:47,220
what are you going to chant that me kind
of what 2008 with the fucking Boston

195
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,900
Celtics, the fuck out
of here. Um, so anyway,

196
00:11:51,901 --> 00:11:56,710
and then I ended up fucking leaving it.
Natus a slice of pizza. Like did you see,

197
00:11:56,711 --> 00:11:59,020
I loved, uh, what's his face? Um,

198
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,920
El Pres there from fucking
barstool that video.

199
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,680
He took him just eating all kinds of bed.
That's what I did.

200
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:06,420
I went and I got to say,

201
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,470
I was watching the game with
Bobby Kelly and then I went,

202
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,000
he dropped me off when I'm staying
here in New York and I, uh,

203
00:12:13,001 --> 00:12:18,001
went over and just got a slice a pizza
from the better famous race in the area

204
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,660
and I'm
just sat there by myself,

205
00:12:22,661 --> 00:12:26,110
like that weird fucking feeling,
you know,

206
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,440
when you're that close and you fucking
lose and then it's the double whammy of

207
00:12:31,781 --> 00:12:35,050
not only did you lose,
but that's the end of hockey for the year,

208
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,880
which by the way, thank you Canada for
hockey. Jesus Christ. I still maintain,

209
00:12:39,881 --> 00:12:43,510
it's a fucking, it's the
best of the four sports. Um,

210
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:49,690
I was just sitting there eating that
fucking thing by myself. Gone at fuck.

211
00:12:49,691 --> 00:12:54,650
And now I got to do the podcast and I got
to eat crow the next fucking day while

212
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,810
was fucking me. But I'm
over it. And um, all right.

213
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,000
So now that I've been a bit
of a cup of tea, a goaltender,

214
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,030
which he really doesn't deserve.
Uh,

215
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,630
so 1967 I'm going off the top of my head,

216
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,990
cause one of these mall where fucking
we know things took over my computer.

217
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:14,020
I have a brand new laptop
and they'd already it watch
out when they say you need

218
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:18,820
the new flash, whatever your
flash player needs to be updated.

219
00:13:18,821 --> 00:13:19,750
I clicked on that.

220
00:13:19,751 --> 00:13:23,980
So now I have to spend a fucking day
this week at the fucking apple store

221
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:27,070
figuring out how to get rid
of this fucking thing. Uh,

222
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,710
may all you fucking hackers
out there burn in hell.

223
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:32,140
All you fucking at the
fucking assholes who did this.

224
00:13:32,141 --> 00:13:37,030
It's like you can't go after bankers.
You can't go after fucking real pray.

225
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,690
You got to fucking get some dumb bald
fucking redheaded contracts team.

226
00:13:40,691 --> 00:13:42,130
Just lost the Stanley Cup final.

227
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,960
You've got to fucking take
over my computer so he can
make more money off of JC

228
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:51,310
Penney. You fucking assholes. So anyways,

229
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,000
sad sacks fans.

230
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,590
So this morning I got to go downstairs
into the laundry room of a where I'm

231
00:13:56,591 --> 00:14:01,480
staying here and um, to
do my laundry here, right?

232
00:14:01,481 --> 00:14:04,870
So I go downstairs to go do it.
You figure Thursday morning,

233
00:14:04,871 --> 00:14:06,070
there's not going to be anybody here,

234
00:14:06,071 --> 00:14:08,830
but actually most of the machines would
taken up. And fortunately I got one.

235
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,000
And um, so I ended up
going downstairs, you know,

236
00:14:13,001 --> 00:14:15,550
after the Washington was done in this
guy sitting there and he's fucking

237
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:18,280
assholes who does his laundry
like once a leap year,

238
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,850
he's got all these bags of shit and he's
like taken up all the machines and he

239
00:14:21,851 --> 00:14:25,090
starts going like a, yeah, I'm just
still waiting for one more, like worried,

240
00:14:25,091 --> 00:14:27,490
like I'm going to take one. I go, that
one's mine. It's almost done. He's like,

241
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,760
all right. And the is mine is done.
He's like, you want this? You want this,

242
00:14:30,761 --> 00:14:33,640
like trying to get me to take the basket,
you know, over. And it's just like buddy,

243
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,550
relax, right? So I take my shit out

244
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:42,790
and you know, the stuff, I'm going to just
let dry him the apartment. I fold that.

245
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:47,140
And then I put my socks and underwears
into the dryer and then all of a sudden

246
00:14:47,141 --> 00:14:50,050
he comes around the corner with
this load of wet laundry and goes,

247
00:14:50,051 --> 00:14:53,060
I'm just going to leave this here.
Absolutely. I'm like, what? He goes,

248
00:14:53,061 --> 00:14:55,130
I'm just going to leave this here. I'm
like, what the fuck is he talking about?

249
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,620
Then I realized that was somebody
else's laundry. I'm like,

250
00:14:57,621 --> 00:15:01,730
is that somebody else's
laundry? He's like, yeah, I got
to. Don't drag me into this.

251
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,780
He goes, what? I go, don't drag me
into this. That's not my laundry.

252
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:09,950
Don't ask for my, okay, look, I'm the
salting of the fucking laundry room.

253
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,630
Things like you have to say anything. I'm
like, you guys are fucking selfish cunt.

254
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,493
Right?

255
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:20,030
So I walk out just one of those
people you just want to get away from.

256
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:25,490
So I go out and I pushed the button and
I'm waiting for the fucking elevator.

257
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:26,750
Right?
And I look up,

258
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:29,450
I realized I didn't push the button
because I'm so still thinking about the

259
00:15:29,451 --> 00:15:32,990
fucking game and what we could have done,
which is all futile at this point.

260
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,830
And I hit the up button and all
of a sudden he comes walking out.

261
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:41,540
So now it's like I got a fucking,
I got a write up with this asshole.

262
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:45,620
So I'm like, well, you know what?
I'm the first floor of apartments.

263
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,640
So worst case scenario, he
gets off on my floor. You know?

264
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:52,190
You know what this fucking asshole does.
You know what he does?

265
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,750
You know what it does?

266
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,740
It gets in the elevator
and he pushes lobby.

267
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:04,230
You fucking Billy. He got on my
elevator. Okay. Which is a thing.

268
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,450
My elevator is a thing.
If you get on it first,

269
00:16:06,451 --> 00:16:11,190
it's your fucking elevator and if somebody
gets on after you and then fucking

270
00:16:11,191 --> 00:16:12,900
hits a floor before you're getting off,

271
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,920
they interrupted your life twice and
they should apologize when they get off.

272
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,640
I do it. That's my, that's
my elevator out of kit.

273
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,640
Is there anything worse when
you're in a tall fucking building?

274
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,750
You come down and some fucking asshole
on 18 hits it and he gets on and then

275
00:16:27,751 --> 00:16:30,750
fucking hit 17 it's like he
couldn't take the stairs.

276
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:32,410
Yeah,

277
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,810
yeah. Know you wear your wing tips.
We're going to get scuffed up.

278
00:16:34,811 --> 00:16:39,710
Would you turn the corner? Oh, Bill,

279
00:16:39,711 --> 00:16:44,300
what are you really mad at? Ah,
my team lost. God dammit. Um,

280
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,930
oh, I was going to say, this is off
the top of my head. The expansion six,

281
00:16:47,931 --> 00:16:52,430
if I remember correctly,
was the Philadelphia flyers.

282
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:57,440
Pittsburgh penguins,
the Minnesota North Stars,

283
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,930
the St Louis Blues, the La Kings
in the California golden seals.

284
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,170
So the California golden
seals then I think became

285
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,500
the Oakland Seals in,

286
00:17:12,501 --> 00:17:16,400
somehow they ended up in Cleveland
and became the Cleveland Barons.

287
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,990
And then they folded,

288
00:17:17,991 --> 00:17:21,440
or maybe a few of them sort of
combined with Minnesota north stars.

289
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:24,260
I can't quite remember what happened
to them. So they never won one.

290
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,590
Let's see if I can do
this top of my head right.

291
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:30,440
The flyers won at first 74 and 75

292
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,590
then the next ones to win it.

293
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,223
We're,

294
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:40,500
well,
let's see here.

295
00:17:40,501 --> 00:17:45,180
Would it be the Dallas Stop Minnesota
then be the Dallas Stars in 1999?

296
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,050
No, the Pittsburgh Penguins. They want

297
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:56,950
flyers. The penguins, the Dallas Stars
in [inaudible] 99, then the La kings

298
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:03,570
and then the fucking uh,
Saint Louis Blues when it last night.

299
00:18:03,571 --> 00:18:07,290
So it took 52 years,
53 seasons,

300
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:13,980
um, for the expansion six, all
of those great fucking teams,

301
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:18,390
um, that added so much to
hockey, doubled the league.

302
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:20,823
MMM.

303
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,060
To finally had the last
one win the Stanley Cup.

304
00:18:25,061 --> 00:18:26,560
Here's the weird thing about hockey,
right?

305
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:30,430
Let's say you had a 16 league and you
were adding another six teams who are

306
00:18:30,431 --> 00:18:34,660
obviously going to be weak, right?
Because there are new teams.

307
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:36,350
Okay.

308
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:41,060
How would you divide those up if you're
going to make two conferences once you

309
00:18:41,061 --> 00:18:43,970
take three of the original in one,

310
00:18:43,971 --> 00:18:47,750
three of the new and three of the
original six and the other in three hockey

311
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:48,530
didn't do that.

312
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:53,510
They kept all the original six in one
division and put all the expansion six in

313
00:18:53,511 --> 00:18:54,500
another division.

314
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,270
So the first round of the playoffs was
basically the Stanley Cup final between

315
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:00,650
the two fucking original six teams.

316
00:19:00,651 --> 00:19:04,610
And that's why I believe we swept the
blues in 1970. Last time he played,

317
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,290
they were like go fucking
brand new franchise.

318
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:08,983
MMM.

319
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:10,910
So anyway,

320
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:15,190
is there anything else that I wanted to
talk about as far as hockey? I can't,

321
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,570
I literally cannot even go on my computer.
And what's funny is I,

322
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:22,520
I tried refreshing and clearing all my
web browser history and I lost all my

323
00:19:22,521 --> 00:19:26,630
passwords. I can't even get into my
fucking email. It's a fucking nightmare.

324
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:32,450
Um, so now I'm going to
go over and, you know,

325
00:19:32,451 --> 00:19:36,680
talk to one of the geniuses at the apple
store to see if they can fucking figure

326
00:19:36,681 --> 00:19:41,480
out one of the evil geniuses who came
up with this mall where horseshit. Um,

327
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:44,330
I've now realized I'm not clicking
on anything anymore. Okay.

328
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,520
I'm done with this shit.
I'm going to get a rotary phone.

329
00:19:46,521 --> 00:19:51,020
If you want to get in contact with me,
just fucking call me. Maybe I'll be home.

330
00:19:51,021 --> 00:19:55,700
Maybe I won't be, I'm just
going to go back to old school
shit cause um, you know,

331
00:19:55,701 --> 00:19:59,360
I was telling you when, you know, I have
these acting gigs when I go down on the,

332
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,613
um,

333
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,300
the,
uh,

334
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,230
the set there, you
know, in between setups,

335
00:20:06,231 --> 00:20:08,630
I don't bring my phone or anything cause
I just feel like it just takes me out

336
00:20:08,631 --> 00:20:10,250
of what little game I have as an actor.

337
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:14,540
I was actually down there and there was
a book on a coffee table and I actually

338
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:15,860
started reading it and I was like,

339
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:19,340
this is what I should be doing between
fucking, you know, when there was,

340
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,370
when there's a long turn around, like
it's going to be like a fucking half hour.

341
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:25,310
You don't want to keep doing the lines
in your head because then you can be like

342
00:20:25,311 --> 00:20:27,530
a robot when you go out there.
At least that's how I'm wired.

343
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:31,490
But actually reading a book and old
man, Old Lady thing to do, it's fucking,

344
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:35,420
it's the shit that could believe how
enjoyable it was. It was actually,

345
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:38,990
it turned out to is Pete
Holmes's book, um, comedy God,

346
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:42,520
which I immediately thought
was funny. I'm like, all right,

347
00:20:42,521 --> 00:20:45,190
is he just doing this thing where
he sleeps? Like overly bragging,

348
00:20:45,191 --> 00:20:50,170
doing like a run burgundy thing?
And it was actually a lot of look forward.

349
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:53,890
I was skimming reading was a lot of it
was about like him being brought up in

350
00:20:53,891 --> 00:20:57,870
religious and religion, overly
religious and getting into stand up.

351
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,610
And I read,
uh,

352
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:05,060
a couple of chapters of his book and
I was trying to find to see if he had

353
00:21:05,981 --> 00:21:10,630
mentioned the first time I ever worked
with him just to see what his take was on

354
00:21:10,631 --> 00:21:11,081
that weekend.

355
00:21:11,081 --> 00:21:13,570
The first time I've ever worked with
Pete Holmes is I worked in at this comedy

356
00:21:13,571 --> 00:21:16,540
club. I don't even if it's still out
there, was called Brewster's in Peoria,

357
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:19,840
Illinois. Hometown of the Great
Lake. Great Richard Pryor,

358
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:24,370
grace comedian of all time. And
um, we did this gig out there.

359
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:28,480
I just remembered it was like mostly a
bar and on stage it was sort of done up

360
00:21:28,481 --> 00:21:33,120
like this old west kind of thing with
like these big whiskey barrels and looking

361
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:36,520
like provisions and shit where uh,

362
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,970
like we were going to go onto the
fucking Oregon trail or something.

363
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,170
We're up on the,
uh,

364
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,550
up on stage and I believe a long time
ago he actually posted a video of him

365
00:21:45,551 --> 00:21:50,110
bombing during that weekend and we both
went out and watched the ring in an

366
00:21:50,111 --> 00:21:53,620
empty movie theater was the two of us and
both got scared shitless watching that

367
00:21:53,621 --> 00:21:57,500
thing and had a great fucking
weekend working with themselves,

368
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,800
trying to get to that part where
he first moved to New York.

369
00:21:59,801 --> 00:22:02,800
But I actually read the part where his
marriage first marriage fell apart. Man,

370
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:06,370
that fucking guy's a great writer. So
check out that book. It'd be get a chance.

371
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,810
There's also another book.

372
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,960
MMM,
okay.

373
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:15,160
That just came out on Greg Geraldo,
which I didn't even know was coming out,

374
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:16,720
so I don't even know who wrote the thing.

375
00:22:16,721 --> 00:22:19,240
I just saw Bobby Kelly
promoted it on his Instagram.

376
00:22:19,241 --> 00:22:24,040
So I'm definitely going to
get that book. Um, you know,

377
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,800
I don't know.
I don't even know how to do with people.

378
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,530
I don't know what I'm doing. I'm fucking
devastated. I really am devastated.

379
00:22:29,531 --> 00:22:32,950
My fucking beloved Bruins lost.

380
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:38,190
And I'm also oddly really
happy for Saint Louis,

381
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:43,270
you know, long suffering fans. It's
just the weirdest fucking feeling.

382
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:45,550
MMM.

383
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:48,220
I was actually sitting there with Bobby
and we just don't do you this fucking

384
00:22:48,221 --> 00:22:50,530
bullshit. And I was just like, they play
or the bed, they're the better team.

385
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,410
They're the better team.
And when they raised the cop,

386
00:22:53,411 --> 00:22:56,270
just seeing how excited the guys actually
had a smile on his face and Bobby's

387
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:58,090
looking and it's like, dude,
I fucking love this shit.

388
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:02,350
This is the best fucking trophy ever.
Um,

389
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:07,330
but I, I would be lying to
you if I am not fucking, uh,

390
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,940
if I didn't say I wasn't fucking
devastated right now. Jesus Christ.

391
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,270
And then, then that's it.
Thank God for Moto Gp.

392
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:20,130
Thank God I got into motorcycle racing
because took to go from the end of the

393
00:23:20,131 --> 00:23:24,570
fucking NHL playoffs and
just the level of intensity,

394
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:29,160
you know, trying to
ease your way, you know,

395
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:36,630
into fucking the dog days of
fucking baseball. You know,

396
00:23:36,631 --> 00:23:36,821
I,

397
00:23:36,821 --> 00:23:40,650
I always equated it must be like what ric
flair felt like after doing a road of,

398
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,240
you know,

399
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,320
of run of wrestling and then cut trying
to come home to his family life and

400
00:23:45,321 --> 00:23:49,010
trying to come down from
fucking woo styling, profiling.

401
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:52,700
I'll let Shane screaming.
It's like this fan version of that.

402
00:23:52,701 --> 00:23:57,350
So thank God for fucking Moto GP and
I get to watch those fucking amazing

403
00:23:57,351 --> 00:24:00,080
lunatics race those bikes
around a 200 miles an hour.

404
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:04,400
And I'm not shitting on baseball because
I do love baseball. Actually. Um,

405
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,800
you know, I've been so into the NBA
finals in the Stanley Cup final that,

406
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:12,980
you know, the other day when there was a,
there was a day off. I actually was like,

407
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:15,170
I have to watch some
sort of competition here.

408
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:20,600
And I watched the Yankees mets
game and I was able to get into it.

409
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:22,010
Um,

410
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:25,970
I prefer the Yankee feed over the meth
feed just because I'm more familiar with

411
00:24:25,971 --> 00:24:27,890
that.
Michael K and all of that.

412
00:24:27,891 --> 00:24:32,190
And I also love listen
Depaulo Neil and [inaudible].

413
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:36,470
But I was just sitting there. I
Dunno, I have to tell you this,

414
00:24:36,471 --> 00:24:39,200
so let's, let's talk. So in the end,

415
00:24:39,201 --> 00:24:42,860
congratulations to the Saint Louis Blues.

416
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,710
Congratulations to Billington
for proving me wrong.

417
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:50,090
I mean he had just forced stand on your
head. Fucking saves in a game. Seven.

418
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:53,690
I mean, you don't get lucky like that. I
think the kid is the fucking real deal.

419
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:56,570
All right there. I said it. Um,

420
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,870
but I've gotten so into uh,

421
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:05,360
this NBA final finals, Jesus
Christ, jumping back and forth here.

422
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:10,900
I was initially for Toronto and I still
really kind of am because of the Toronto

423
00:25:11,601 --> 00:25:16,070
fans, but I have to play. At first I
was making fun of Drake. Now I love them

424
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:21,020
because I find myself watching him

425
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:27,200
when the ball's being brought to court.
Like he is so out of his fucking mind.

426
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:30,020
He's,
he's literally pacing the sidelines.

427
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,390
Like he's coaching the team.

428
00:25:32,391 --> 00:25:35,360
Like I was watching them when they were
bringing the ball up and he was just

429
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:38,990
manically making this spread,
like spread the off fence

430
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:45,440
fucking uh, gesture. And
I'm going like, this guy

431
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,730
has, has, has lost his fucking mind,

432
00:25:49,731 --> 00:25:54,731
like tease doing shit that I do in my
living room when I know nobody's watching.

433
00:25:54,861 --> 00:25:57,440
He's doing this on television.
So part of me,

434
00:25:57,441 --> 00:26:01,730
I don't want to run out a win
cause I want to see this again.

435
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:07,700
I don't want to see satisfied Drake.
I want to see longing for a championship.

436
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,830
Drake and a,

437
00:26:09,831 --> 00:26:13,970
that last game watching,
uh,

438
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:17,840
the warriors show why
they fucking champions.

439
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:22,040
You know, and I, I'm not, you know,

440
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:25,760
I didn't get upset with Toronto fans
cheering when kd went down. That was,

441
00:26:25,761 --> 00:26:30,650
that was fear more so than
disrespect. That was just like, oh,

442
00:26:30,651 --> 00:26:34,820
thank God this guy is out.
All right.

443
00:26:34,821 --> 00:26:38,900
Although there was that
one cunt in the front row,

444
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:42,110
you know, who was dressed,
sort of like, you know,

445
00:26:42,111 --> 00:26:45,010
he looked like he listened to
fucking remember those awful, uh,

446
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,240
rap metal bands from
the early two thousands.

447
00:26:48,241 --> 00:26:52,110
He looked like a fan of one of those
bands and he was like waving bye bye.

448
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:56,890
And it's just like, who the fuck
does that? Who does that? Right? Um,

449
00:26:58,790 --> 00:26:59,623
so

450
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,360
this is what I think happens in
that series. I think golden state.

451
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:09,840
I know, but you've got Leonard
Leonard is just fucking ice water

452
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:14,630
when you won't even give a fist pound
to one of your own fucking players.

453
00:27:14,631 --> 00:27:16,820
That's when you know you're in the zone.

454
00:27:16,821 --> 00:27:20,090
He's like the fucking Marshawn lynch.

455
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:25,070
Like his attitude when he doesn't
give a fuck about anything.

456
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:26,870
Except when you saw that quote,

457
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:31,610
when they split it home and they were
going out to golden state and the, the,

458
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:34,460
I must set the teacher, the coach was
going, you know, we go out there, we did,

459
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,990
we get one, you all we to
do is win one game. And he
speaks up and said, fuck that.

460
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,180
Let's win too.
And then they did.

461
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,930
He's like fucking John Wayne in a western.

462
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:52,280
So I don't know. I don't actually,
I gotta be honest with you.

463
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,440
I will be happy either way.

464
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:56,783
MMM.

465
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,400
Watching this series, no matter
what happens, I will, you know,

466
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:05,230
in the end I think I want to see Toronto
went a little more just because they

467
00:28:05,231 --> 00:28:08,020
haven't won a championship in so long,
but like the next championship,

468
00:28:08,021 --> 00:28:12,130
I really wanted to see Toronto when it
was, I wanted to see them win a cup. Um,

469
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:18,420
you know, I, I will tell you
though, anytime I see Toronto
fans gathering outside,

470
00:28:18,421 --> 00:28:22,170
watching something on a screen, I get
a negative feeling going. Like, oh,

471
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:26,070
how many times we've seen this,
they gradually start peeling off.

472
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:30,540
It's one of the saddest, slowest, um,

473
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:34,680
departures of a fan base you're
ever going to fucking see.

474
00:28:34,681 --> 00:28:37,230
But God bless them because
they do show up. Um,

475
00:28:37,231 --> 00:28:42,210
so I wanted to go seven games.
My gut feeling is golden state

476
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:48,400
comes out and wins game six and
then loses game seven in Toronto.

477
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:51,370
I just think Toronto might wear
him down by that point. Uh,

478
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,280
golden state is really banged up. But, uh,

479
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:57,340
I will tell you what would be fucking
sick as if Toronto goes into their

480
00:28:57,341 --> 00:29:01,420
building and fucking ends their
dynasty in their own building. Oh.

481
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:03,401
Oh,
you know what,

482
00:29:03,401 --> 00:29:08,401
that will take me back to 1985 when
Kareem hit that last fucking sky hook.

483
00:29:08,441 --> 00:29:11,240
I never forget that. And he ran
down the court and he fucking made,

484
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,900
he balled up both his
fists like that's it.

485
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:17,110
We got these motherfuckers
and I was just like, ugh.

486
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:22,900
They finally beat us in the final
finals. All right, and with that, let's,

487
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:23,973

comedy acting like a sports queen.

No text message. When we won the
world series, no text message.

521
00:31:35,261 --> 00:31:38,800
When we won the super bowl,
we lose the Stanley Cup final.

522
00:31:38,801 --> 00:31:41,620
Typical New York fan

like they're whack a mole fence.

526
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:53,940

00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:16,900
You guys played fucking amazing hockey
and I really thought it was a great blend

568
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:21,970
of the old style hard style of play that
I grew up watching and the new style

569
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:26,330
and um, great franchise,
great fucking fans.

570
00:34:26,331 --> 00:34:30,380
I'm sure a lot of band wagoners we'll
be there on Saturday for the parade.

571
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:33,830
But all you old school guys,
you know,

572
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,310
congratulate men and women who
watched that team. Congratulations.

573
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:40,520
God knows you fucking
waited longer. Ford, uh,

574
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:44,990
which makes it all the more sweeter,
right? And Joy. This fucking sad music.

575
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,410
I want up. They'll be sad music. I
have no idea. I don't pick the music.

576
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:51,410
And then we'll have a greatest
hits from a Thursday afternoon,

577
00:34:51,411 --> 00:34:54,990
just before Friday, Monday morning
morning podcast when maybe I was a

578
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:55,890
little happier.

579
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:05,400
Jones, when was the date?
30 told the chest plate.

580
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:10,520
Mommy does cry in and everybody's
dressed up in black suits.

581
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:11,830
Don't wind up pay.

582
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:16,880
The last respects told the black true
is the question that we're Runda but

583
00:35:17,791 --> 00:35:21,990
everyone knows that every day is a
different number. So what are your Tom?

584
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:27,500
Tom's just remember you'll always
have a place in this world as a member

585
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,960
expressively who passed away back in 92
best believe that all the boys in the

586
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:37,020
hood, it's got whatever we go,

587
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:42,530
whatever we be thinking of how we've
rung in the clubs smoking and now we're

588
00:35:43,381 --> 00:35:47,340
missing out on a hood.
FICUS Amery Day back in the,

589
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,840
we had a good fight.

590
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:52,810
Everything has changed and people
are looking lonely as gold.

591
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:56,370
B strains in the new year.
Z without your home.

592
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,170
But a must have.

593
00:35:58,171 --> 00:36:03,171
We can do except for group through
opportunity to make sure we dealt with and

594
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:10,030
[inaudible] hurts to save the boy. You're
broke bread with six feet in the dirt.

595
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:17,890
Hey, what's going on? It's
built burn. It's the Monday
morning podcast for Monday,

596
00:36:17,891 --> 00:36:21,960
June 12 2011. How's it going? Eh,

597
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,510
get fuzzy on the damn man.
[inaudible] um,

598
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:29,100
yeah.
Why,

599
00:36:29,101 --> 00:36:32,520
why do I keep doing these by my self?

600
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:38,090
I have the Star spangled banner is in my
fucking head because the NBA finals in

601
00:36:39,011 --> 00:36:42,970
the Nhl finals have have never been on
the same night and I've been watching all

602
00:36:42,971 --> 00:36:47,110
of them. So that's all I've been
hearing every fucking night. Oh,

603
00:36:47,111 --> 00:36:50,000
C car and your c.

604
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,550
And then when you watch the fucking
NHL finals, you also get, Oh,

605
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:59,350
Canada do glory.

606
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:02,530
Pretty Major.

607
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:07,530
Both set up and hockey
and some fucking cash

608
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:10,623
boo.

609
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,960
The Alaskan pipeline and Fuckin
people who think they're from France,

610
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:22,740
um, just every fucking night. And uh,

611
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:26,220
you know,
start to fuck with me.

612
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:30,270
Can you guys tell that I have absolutely
nothing prepared for this week?

613
00:37:30,271 --> 00:37:33,900
Nothing funny to say. Um, I don't,

614
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,090
I got nothing.
It's a minute.

615
00:37:36,091 --> 00:37:41,091
23 in and I'm ready to pull the fucking
plug cause I've got too much shit to do.

616
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:45,420
I'm actually recording this on a Sunday
afternoon. A Beautiful, beautiful Sunday,

617
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:50,610
sunny Sunday afternoon.
Did you go to church below,

618
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:52,620
Geesh? Uh, no I did not.

619
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:57,640
Although when I was out in the forest,
I gotta tell you when I,

620
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:00,210
last week when I thought I was
going to get eaten by a bear,

621
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,260
I did pray to a higher power.
And I know what a lot of people right now,

622
00:38:04,261 --> 00:38:06,180
a lot of you,
Jesus freaks out there.

623
00:38:06,181 --> 00:38:10,710
A lot of you people who were into the old
Jay star are probably like, yeah, see,

624
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:15,510
see, you believe you believe. Um,
I believe in higher power. Yes,

625
00:38:15,511 --> 00:38:19,830
absolutely. But I don't believe
in the, in, in, uh, the stories.

626
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:25,350
I don't think he's ever talked to anybody.
That's, I think that's what I believe.

627
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:26,281
You know,

628
00:38:26,281 --> 00:38:31,230
like today I was in the car and my
girl was bugging me and I said to her,

629
00:38:31,231 --> 00:38:33,930
you know what? You're really making
me want to slap you in the face.

630
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:41,890
You know what it is? She's held that on
fucking painting the Goddamn apartment.

631
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,450
I don't know why.
All right.

632
00:38:43,451 --> 00:38:47,320
And I have to do a benefit tonight and
then I have to go fucking go straight to

633
00:38:47,321 --> 00:38:51,970
the airport and take a red eye to Chicago
coming in a day early because I got

634
00:38:51,971 --> 00:38:56,560
some friends out there and there, they
got some ice time somewhere and you know,

635
00:38:57,370 --> 00:39:00,310
why not? I'll fucking come in a
day early, play a little hockey,

636
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:05,020
continue my Peter Pan Lifestyle.
So of course she's just like,

637
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:08,410
I want to pay to live and grow.
We have to get this done.

638
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:13,270
We gotta get drop cloth, we
gotta get some paid, Yadda,

639
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,950
fucking Yada. Right? So where did she
go? I go, all right, what if, where,

640
00:39:16,951 --> 00:39:18,970
where are we going? Where
are we going? And she's like,

641
00:39:18,971 --> 00:39:23,440
we have to go to home depot. All
right. Which I fucking hate home depot,

642
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,550
I can't stand it.

643
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:29,730
All right with that 900 foot ceilings
and they're two employees that they have

644
00:39:29,831 --> 00:39:34,330
there and you finally run into
one and it's like, you know,

645
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,490
first of all you go win the fucking place.

646
00:39:36,491 --> 00:39:40,120
And that same feeling I had when I walked
into the forest where I was like all

647
00:39:40,121 --> 00:39:41,890
alone and I didn't know what
the fuck was going to happen.

648
00:39:41,891 --> 00:39:45,820
That's what you feel like when you
go into these, these superstores is,

649
00:39:45,821 --> 00:39:49,990
they call them and then you walk in there
when you finally fucking find somebody,

650
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:56,380
you know, oh that's not my department.
I just do window shades. You know,

651
00:39:56,381 --> 00:39:58,900
back in the day when you
walked into a hardware store,

652
00:39:58,901 --> 00:40:02,020
the fucking person knew the whole
goddamn store, first of all,

653
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:06,430
because it was only the size of
a, I dunno, I dunno. I've store

654
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:12,640
and I know all you guys out there who
get on your knees and slurp the corporate

655
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:16,270
cock are going to tell me, well,
you didn't have as many selections.

656
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:20,050
Go Fuck Yourself. All right,
swallow the load and kill yourself.

657
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:24,220
Because though the old school hardware
stores, they were better. You walk in,

658
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:27,340
there was some grumpy guy
there and you'd be like, yeah,

659
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:31,780
I need a fucking widget and a no, no,
no, no fucking shower curtain rink.

660
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:35,590
And he'd look up, you know from
some shitty was whittling on,

661
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,670
he tell you exactly what the fuck it was
and he continue whittling as a corner

662
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:42,600
of his eye.
He looked at you as you went in the wrong,

663
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:47,700
you written that down a on a bottom
bottom.

664
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:51,770
You were one of those guys. Now you've got
all those Douche bags out there, right?

665
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,900
People work at home depot,

666
00:40:53,901 --> 00:40:57,740
basically people who couldn't get
a job at the apple store, you know,

667
00:40:57,741 --> 00:41:00,530
they couldn't get one of those genius
tee shirts and now they get an orange

668
00:41:00,531 --> 00:41:04,700
apron and then he'd just stand around.
You know, you're looking at their nails.

669
00:41:04,701 --> 00:41:08,630
I don't know what. So anyways, we get
down to this fucking place and uh,

670
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:13,400
as we're driving there,
all right? Evidently,

671
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:17,360
whatever paint she wants to get, I
wasn't involved in this fucking decision,

672
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:21,170
you know? Um, whatever the brand is,

673
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:24,980
we're on our way over there, which I
really don't have time to do. She goes,

674
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,000
oh my God, I hope they have,
you know, Eddie Rabinowitz's,

675
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:33,680
eggshell fucking Robin egg white or
whatever the fuck she talking about.

676
00:41:33,681 --> 00:41:36,080
And immediately my head, I'm
like, why didn't you call ahead?

677
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:39,350
Why didn't you call ahead?
So what do you think happened everybody?

678
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,850
What do you think happened?
We went into the,

679
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:47,020
the fucking monstrosity that is home
depot with their 40,000 fucking different

680
00:41:47,961 --> 00:41:52,310
selections. Guess what? They
didn't have the Eddie Rabinowitz,

681
00:41:52,311 --> 00:41:56,000
Robin Egg, fucking blue,
God damn coffee cream,

682
00:41:56,001 --> 00:41:58,820
whatever the fuck it was called.
They didn't have it.

683
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:03,560
So immediately I get pissed.
So she looks for a silver lining.

684
00:42:03,561 --> 00:42:07,550
Well at least they got drop cloth.
Um,

685
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:12,470
so then we got to get out of this some
shit I didn't have fucking time to do

686
00:42:12,471 --> 00:42:16,690
anyways in judge. She wants me to stop
and Mcdonald to go get her a fucking, uh,

687
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:20,150
the lemonade frozen Frisbee or whatever
the fuck drink they have there.

688
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:23,840
And I'm like, no, I'm not
doing it. I don't have time.

689
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:28,910
So of course she starts pouting. So
what do I do? I give in like a fag.

690
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,810
I given,
you know,

691
00:42:32,811 --> 00:42:36,470
and I was sitting there and
the God damn fucking line

692
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:40,450
and uh, you know,
Mcdonald's is hilarious now.

693
00:42:40,451 --> 00:42:41,890
Evidently they're trying to go healthy.

694
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,010
I think the biggest loser
is really starting to fuck
with these fast food places.

695
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:49,150
Cause all these fatties are finally
realizing, Oh really? I can't have three,

696
00:42:49,151 --> 00:42:52,510
7,000 calorie triple double
cheeseburgers with Bacon on it.

697
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:57,730
Evidently that's the reason why I have
this slab of shit that's covering my

698
00:42:57,731 --> 00:43:02,260
knees at this point. Forget
about my genitalia. I think they,

699
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,780
uh,
the biggest loser,

700
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:07,780
I think that they've actually had an
effect because I went there and you could

701
00:43:07,781 --> 00:43:12,550
actually get like a Waldorf salad or some
shit, some salad with like an apple in,

702
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,860
which was hilarious because you
know, it's sucks. It's still somehow,

703
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,790
and then they had like some
low fat yogurt with WWE is,

704
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,660
as long as Mcdonald's is doing it,

705
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:24,070
it's somehow still going to come
out to about 9,000 calories. So a,

706
00:43:24,071 --> 00:43:27,430
what the fuck was my point here? Let's
talking about slapping her in the face.

707
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:29,643
Okay.

708
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:34,490
Oh, that's what I said. I'm a
slapping the face. Ah, Jesus Christ.

709
00:43:34,491 --> 00:43:38,480
I was going somewhere with this.
The fuck was I talking about?

710
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:42,620
How did I get into this is
talking about going in the woods.

711
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:48,590
Ah, Jesus ain't no, I don't even fucking
remember. I'm such a long winded jackass.

712
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:51,840
What the fuck was I talking about?

713
00:43:51,841 --> 00:43:55,010
There's something about slapped her in
the face and then I didn't do that and

714
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:59,730
that tied into some other shit that
I can't fucking remember. Ah, fuck.

715
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:01,860
Why do I try? Oh, it's
talking about church, right?

716
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,750
Why don't believe all that's right.
That's right. Church. There we go.

717
00:44:06,751 --> 00:44:11,670
We're back on track. Everybody back
on track. So I said, I'm going to,

718
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:13,700
I really feel like
slapping you in the face,

719
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:16,920
this is when we want in the way of the
Mcdonald's. And she goes, you know,

720
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:20,370
obviously looking at him, looking
at me like, don't do that. So I go,

721
00:44:20,371 --> 00:44:21,240
you know what I'm going to do?

722
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:25,590
I'm going to slap Jesus instead
because she's into rosaries, you know,

723
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,240
and she has it hanging from the fucking
rear view mirror of our stupid Prius.

724
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:34,830
So I'm gonna do, I'm gonna
slap Jesus. Anyway, so he's
sitting there on the cross,

725
00:44:34,831 --> 00:44:39,330
of course, always in that
moment, look what I did for you.

726
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,433
Right?

727
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:45,150
So I just fucking slap them right on
the cross and he flies back and forth.

728
00:44:45,151 --> 00:44:49,620
So she starts giving me shit.
Don't slap Jesus. Right.

729
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:53,120
And uh, yeah, that's when I
just kind of said, you know,

730
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:58,140
he really think that this
happened, that God, you know,

731
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:03,320
took out as giant fucking hire being
dick came into this fucking petri dish,

732
00:45:04,591 --> 00:45:06,480
the size of a Jacuzzi.
Right.

733
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:11,190
And then took out some sort of syringe
in artificially inseminated. Uh,

734
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,760
what's her face there? Jennifer was
that was at his mom's name. Right.

735
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:17,753
Okay.

736
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,420
Do you really think that happened?
It didn't,

737
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:27,700
it didn't happen. Am I saying there's not
a higher power? No, I'm not saying that.

738
00:45:27,701 --> 00:45:30,370
I'm just saying all these fucking
stories that they're telling you

739
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:36,320
are there that made up, this
guy did the, uh, you know,

740
00:45:36,321 --> 00:45:41,321
we came out of a womb that
was never in a banged and uh,

741
00:45:42,081 --> 00:45:45,590
then he died for you when the only way
to get into heaven is if you do what we

742
00:45:45,591 --> 00:45:48,830
say and uh, give us some money. I mean,

743
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:52,130
how fucking dumb are you if you go
into that shit, I can't help you.

744
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:54,530
I can't fucking help you.

745
00:45:57,170 --> 00:46:00,050
But if you want to talk about a higher
power, definitely believe in that shit.

746
00:46:00,051 --> 00:46:04,880
But none of us know what it is. I don't
believe. I don't, I don't fucking know.

747
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:09,620
I don't know where you go. I
don't know what happens, but uh,

748
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:13,190
neither does anybody else
cause you read it in a book.

749
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:19,940
What happens when you die? Who
wrote it? Who exactly wrote it?

750
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:23,330
How dumb do I sound right now
at all? You, Jesus freaks.

751
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:27,560
Y'All rolling your eyes as you write with
your feathered pen to punish yourself

752
00:46:27,561 --> 00:46:32,270
for some bullshit that you did.
Um, here's something for you.

753
00:46:32,271 --> 00:46:34,730
I don't believe in ghosts either,
right?

754
00:46:34,731 --> 00:46:37,160
We're just going to go right down the
line of shit that I don't believe in.

755
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:40,900
I don't believe in Jesus and I
don't believe in ghosts, but, uh,

756
00:46:40,901 --> 00:46:41,621
I gotta admit this.

757
00:46:41,621 --> 00:46:45,380
Some sort of paranormal shit been going
on in my fucking apartment lately.

758
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,900
All right?
We went on vacation,

759
00:46:47,901 --> 00:46:52,100
we came back and all our forks are
missing except for two of them,

760
00:46:56,630 --> 00:47:00,840
you know, and on two different
occasions I've been playing guitar.

761
00:47:00,841 --> 00:47:05,040
I get up out of my little fucking
play pen area, slash, office,

762
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:09,120
and, uh, I walk in to talk to
NEA and then I come back in.

763
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:13,860
My settings are different
on my fucking amp. So, uh,

764
00:47:13,861 --> 00:47:18,861
I think considering that the ghost stole
my forks in his fucking with my amps,

765
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:27,630
there's only one logical
conclusion that this spirit,

766
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:33,310
uh, died at a Scorpions concert.
That's what happened. All right?

767
00:47:33,311 --> 00:47:36,640
And the only heavy metal fans got
debt. Remember that? That song,

768
00:47:36,641 --> 00:47:39,310
there's no one like you and the
guy had the forks in his eyes.

769
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,100
Remember that Shit.
I think that that's what's going on.

770
00:47:42,101 --> 00:47:46,300
So I'm going to be on the next season of
a ghost hunters and I'm going to sit in

771
00:47:46,301 --> 00:47:49,720
there with some douche bag with a
video camera yelling at the ghost.

772
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:54,760
You have exactly four
minutes to show yourself.

773
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:57,970
Do you ever see that?
Have I talked about that?

774
00:47:57,971 --> 00:48:00,430
How ridiculous that fucking
show ghost hunters is?

775
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:05,350
Those fucking idiots sit around yelling
at the, they always somehow, first of all,

776
00:48:05,351 --> 00:48:09,610
they always know that ghosts name and
they'll just be sitting there yelling at

777
00:48:09,611 --> 00:48:12,070
the ghost,
like threatening,

778
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:16,250
like threatening this
spirit that evidently is,

779
00:48:16,251 --> 00:48:19,240
is hanging out in a
kitchen for all eternity.

780
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:23,650
You know Maggie,

781
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:30,160
we know you're here. Alright,
we're getting sick at this.

782
00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:33,940
You got four minutes to show yourself
or packing up all our equipment.

783
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:35,830
Okay.

784
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:38,650
Right. And what do you think Maggie?
Sinking. We'll do it. I don't give a fuck.

785
00:48:38,651 --> 00:48:42,490
This is the most entertaining shit ever.
Sit here. Frustrating you guys. How,

786
00:48:42,491 --> 00:48:45,730
flicking the year, my little
ghosts, fingers on the way up.

787
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:51,370
You guys believe in ghosts.
Do you believe in that shit?

788
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:55,480
I was actually watching a,
there's some fucking channel,

789
00:48:55,481 --> 00:48:58,510
I can't remember the names of anything.
It's called like Payola or something.

790
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:03,880
Pirelli that's a tire or they,
they have all these fucking unplugged,

791
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:08,890
uh, sets by these bands. That's
my computer making all that noise.

792
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:13,870
And uh, I was watching one. Uh, you
know, when you get to be old like me,

793
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:17,980
he w you just lose
touch with modern music,

794
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:22,150
but there's bands that you just,
you keep hearing their fall out boy,

795
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:26,470
and I'll fuck you while you young people.
Oh my God. That's like Thoreau, 2000,

796
00:49:26,471 --> 00:49:29,770
whatever. I don't give a fuck.
I'm just saying they blend in.

797
00:49:29,771 --> 00:49:33,640
So one of them was my morning jacket.
All right.

798
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:39,400
Now when I grew up, no one would name
a band my morning jacket. All right.

799
00:49:39,401 --> 00:49:43,420
You'd name it something that had to do
with Satan or else I wasn't going to

800
00:49:43,421 --> 00:49:47,980
listen to it. So whenever I heard my
morning jacket that just sounded like,

801
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:53,680
uh, you know, it was going to be like that
Jack Johnson's kind of stuff. You know,

802
00:49:53,681 --> 00:49:55,690
that shit that like
women and hippies like.

803
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:58,583
Yeah.

804
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:04,910
Um, so I, I never listen to it, you know,

805
00:50:04,911 --> 00:50:08,390
I just thought it was going to be more
like that fallout boy. Like that whining,

806
00:50:08,391 --> 00:50:12,380
crying. I remember like the last
10 years, that emo shit where,

807
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:15,740
where was that song that, that
I, I made fun of that one week.

808
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,730
[inaudible] two.
Does

809
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:22,410
that sound like you're
going to win anything?

810
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:26,550
That sounds like you're already lost and
you're walking home crying to your mom

811
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:31,370
and you just talking shit cause you to
fucking embarrassed knowing you lost.

812
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:36,530
So I assumed that they were
kind of like that and uh,

813
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:38,900
I dunno man. I watched their,
if they're unplugged set,

814
00:50:38,901 --> 00:50:43,190
they were fucking unbelievable and I
want to download some of their shit.

815
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:45,410
All right,
legally.

816
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,280
So let me know how's your latest album?

817
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:53,420
Because there was somebody else who was
on like leaky Lee was on before and I

818
00:50:53,421 --> 00:50:54,950
watched her shit and I loved it.

819
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:58,160
And then I listened to it on
iTunes and I was like, ah,

820
00:50:58,161 --> 00:51:00,050
the unplugged shit sounded way better.

821
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:04,250
Her shit was like singing through
all this distortion stuff. I,

822
00:51:04,251 --> 00:51:07,700
which I can't stand after a
while, you know, it's like, bitch,

823
00:51:07,701 --> 00:51:10,580
just sing the Goddamn song. Okay,
stop sounding like you're fucking,

824
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:15,680
I'm listening to it. Three
floors above you. You know,

825
00:51:15,681 --> 00:51:17,060
if you're going to do some shit like that,

826
00:51:17,061 --> 00:51:20,270
do it the way Jimmy page did it
and I felt like I was in on acid.

827
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:25,850
You know how he used to do that shit and
he and he would have it you back in the

828
00:51:25,851 --> 00:51:30,851
day you would listen to
albums on headphones and bands
knew it and they knew you

829
00:51:30,951 --> 00:51:35,270
were on drugs and they used to
try to enhance the experience.

830
00:51:35,271 --> 00:51:38,390
That's how great rock used to be.
Okay.

831
00:51:38,391 --> 00:51:40,310
That's how into drugs they were,

832
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:45,050
they knew you were on drugs so they would
make album and they were on drugs and

833
00:51:45,051 --> 00:51:49,940
they would make albums that would make
being on drugs feel better and they used

834
00:51:49,941 --> 00:51:53,270
to do shit where they would,
they wouldn't, whatever.

835
00:51:53,271 --> 00:51:57,590
They'd have some sort of some sort
of effect going on and they would,

836
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:02,180
they would make it go from the left side
to the right side, just your speakers.

837
00:52:02,181 --> 00:52:03,500
But when you had headphones on,

838
00:52:03,501 --> 00:52:07,250
it felt like it pass through
your Goddamn head is tremendous.

839
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,360
I don't know.
I don't know what the fuck they do.

840
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:15,890
The yell into a bullhorn throughout the
whole fucking concert into a microphone

841
00:52:15,891 --> 00:52:19,910
like that. That's the best you can
do. Who does that Shit, you know,

842
00:52:19,911 --> 00:52:22,970
does that all the time?
Is that Guy Scott Weiland said his name,

843
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:26,330
the guy from STP velvet revolver.
He's big into that.

844
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:31,760
Singing through the fucking bullhorn is
he walks around in his a Nazi supermodel

845
00:52:34,161 --> 00:52:34,994
outfit.

846
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:42,920
Anyways, this is the Monday
morning podcast. Everybody,
are you a new listener?

847
00:52:42,921 --> 00:52:46,260
I hope you are. I hope we
continue to grow this podcast. Uh,

848
00:52:46,261 --> 00:52:49,640
I do one of these every God damn
week and people send me questions.

849
00:52:49,641 --> 00:52:53,000
They asked for advice. They send
me lists of underrated, overrated.

850
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:57,200
We talk about Youtube
fucking videos that we like.

851
00:52:57,230 --> 00:53:00,620
I curse a lot because I don't read.
I'm not intelligent.

852
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:06,620
Um, all right. Speaking of youtube videos,
which I keep forgetting to talk about.

853
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:10,940
Um, I got a bunch at this point. Here's
one you got to walk on. These are all,

854
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:13,100
by the way,
all of these can be viewed

855
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:20,900
exclusively@theemmpodcast.com. Um, first
off, I did another tour of a, you know,

856
00:53:20,901 --> 00:53:24,020
those videos I make where I do like
the tours of Los Angeles and show you

857
00:53:24,021 --> 00:53:28,530
different parts of La. I'm actually,
uh, I did want to New York City,

858
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:33,850
um, and we just put that up so we'll have
that on the MLM podcast page. And, uh,

859
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:38,010
do you remember when I was sick a few
weeks ago and I felt like Shit and all

860
00:53:38,011 --> 00:53:42,120
that, uh, this video was shot
the day that I was getting sick.

861
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:45,390
Notice when I'm on the subway, when
I'm walking down there, look at the,

862
00:53:45,391 --> 00:53:50,040
the flop sweat on my giant forehead
as I'm starting to get sick.

863
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:54,270
Um, we got that and here's, here's
a video that has since blown up,

864
00:53:54,271 --> 00:53:57,510
which pisses me off because
I've been meaning to talk
about this one for a month.

865
00:53:57,990 --> 00:54:02,430
There's one a video called fan escapes.
Um,

866
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:07,020
I don't know if I talked to, I don't
think I talked about this one yet. Um,

867
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:12,390
it's basically some kid at an Astros game.
He jumps out of the stands,

868
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:14,820
runs across right field,

869
00:54:15,610 --> 00:54:19,590
gives a great head fake to a
security guard, breaks his ankles.

870
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:24,060
He goes up and over the wall. He
just, and just fucking amazing.

871
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:29,640
He basically climbs up the stadium
and runs out the back of it.

872
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:33,300
And as far as I know,
he got away and uh,

873
00:54:33,301 --> 00:54:36,540
I would love a lot of Europeans to watch
this. Who think every Americans are fat.

874
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:37,560
Fuck,
you should see this guy.

875
00:54:37,561 --> 00:54:42,561
This guy does like a good four or five
pull ups and climbs up out of a stadium

876
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:47,310
from basically center field. It's
amazing. So definitely check that one out.

877
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:51,480
There's another good one out there that I
was watching called. Uh, it's basically,

878
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:55,890
uh, how to, how to talk to cops.
And this one's funny because uh,

879
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:59,670
you could live to people
who actually are doing it,

880
00:54:59,790 --> 00:55:01,350
are actually complete dirt bags,

881
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,980
but they know their rights probably cause
they be getting arrested their entire

882
00:55:04,981 --> 00:55:07,110
life.
And it's really fascinating.

883
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:12,620
I saw this video a long time ago about
how many rights you give up when the cops

884
00:55:12,931 --> 00:55:15,450
pull you over simply because you don't,

885
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,750
you don't know the law and they just
ask you questions. Like in this video,

886
00:55:18,751 --> 00:55:22,110
the guy goes, because the guy was
videotaping, the copy comes over. He goes,

887
00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:26,370
when he videotaped me for, he goes, can I
see that camera please? Now most people,

888
00:55:26,371 --> 00:55:30,540
90% of you would be like, yes officer,
here you go, because you're, you're,

889
00:55:30,541 --> 00:55:33,720
you don't want to get arrested.
This guy was like, no.

890
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:37,170
And the cop goes, why can't
I? The camera goes, AH,

891
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:40,650
cause it's mine and you
need a search warrant.

892
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:45,360
And he just started rattling off this
shit. And the cops just like at fuck,

893
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,390
he knows the rule. I don't know if
he knows it needs a search warrant,

894
00:55:48,391 --> 00:55:52,170
but you know, he needs probable
cause. I'm video taping, it's illegal.

895
00:55:52,171 --> 00:55:56,730
It's not illegal to videotape. And he
just, he stonewalls the guy and he goes,

896
00:55:56,731 --> 00:55:58,740
and I'm on my property,
you're actually on my property,

897
00:55:58,741 --> 00:56:02,490
get off my property police. And every
time he says the shit, you're like,

898
00:56:02,491 --> 00:56:05,190
oh my God, he comes to the beat
down. But it never fucking happens.

899
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:06,473
But who's kidding,
who?

900
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,840
The only reason why it goes down like
this is because there's witnesses.

901
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:13,290
There's too many people standing around
because of this guy tried this shit in

902
00:56:13,291 --> 00:56:14,880
the middle of nowhere with a cop.
The,

903
00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:18,660
the video camera would
be up his ass and uh,

904
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:22,230
he would also be facing some sort of
charges of assaulting the police officer

905
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:26,200
because the police sprained one of his
fingers when he shoved the camera up his

906
00:56:26,201 --> 00:56:29,950
ass. Um, at least that's
been my experience. Um,

907
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:33,640
what are the youtube videos?
Let me make sure I read all of these.

908
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:35,740
Let me show you and show,
you know they used to,

909
00:56:35,741 --> 00:56:40,540
before I move onto the next
topics here, uh, for Christ sake,

910
00:56:40,590 --> 00:56:44,290
where the fuck fucker, the other
youtube videos. Oh, this is a good one.

911
00:56:44,291 --> 00:56:48,820
I think we actually did this one a long
time ago. Uh, boyfriend, fuck you. Uh,

912
00:56:48,821 --> 00:56:50,440
you have to do that shit.
We hit on a girlfriend.

913
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:51,760
She lets you get on a girlfriend.

914
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:55,300
He hit on some girl and she lets you do
it for 10 minutes and then brings up her

915
00:56:55,301 --> 00:56:59,670
boyfriend, uh, this guy does the
reaction that you want to do, uh,

916
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:03,700
to call boyfriend. Fuck you. And
then we got some music ones here,

917
00:57:03,701 --> 00:57:07,150
a crossroads festival. Uh, Steve Winward,

918
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:12,040
Eric Clapton and Steve Jordan, my
favorite drummer and Derek trucks. Um,

919
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:17,080
what else do we got here?
Mark?

920
00:57:17,081 --> 00:57:19,720
Knopfler I haven't even looked at these.
I've been so goddamn busy.

921
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:24,670
We've got some, uh, music ones this week
and a, what the fuck was the other one?

922
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:28,570
Oh, I know what I wanted to talk
about. You guys. Do you guys,

923
00:57:28,571 --> 00:57:32,290
do you have a guilty pleasure movie
that you watch that you would be

924
00:57:32,291 --> 00:57:36,730
unbelievably embarrassed that other
people would know that anytime you see it

925
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:40,390
you definitely watch it. This is mine.
It's actually called the good bye girl,

926
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:47,670
which is arguably one of the
gayest fucking movies of all time.

927
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:50,050
All right.
But what I love about it,

928
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:54,760
the reason why I like it is cause it's
Richard Dreyfus, his first big role.

929
00:57:54,761 --> 00:57:59,761
And I'm a big Richard Dreyfus Fan and
I just love it because you see a guy

930
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:05,410
seizing the opportunity that
he's got this role and he just,

931
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:09,370
he just goes all out. It's a total fucking
chick flick or whatever. But I dunno,

932
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:13,360
he's always funny to me and the amount
of shit that he has to do in the movie

933
00:58:13,361 --> 00:58:17,350
that I would be embarrassed to do when
he pulls it off is why I always end up

934
00:58:17,351 --> 00:58:21,880
watching the movie. But, and I never
watch it from beginning to end.

935
00:58:21,881 --> 00:58:22,990
I always catch it at some point.

936
00:58:22,991 --> 00:58:27,070
Plus I'm a sucker for any movie that's
shot in New York and I get to see what

937
00:58:27,071 --> 00:58:28,450
New York used to look like.

938
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:32,560
So that's another reason why I
love watching that movie. And uh,

939
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:35,600
it's just a great movie and
a lot of different levels.

940
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:40,740
There's another level where
the only people of Color
in that movie play muggers.

941
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,940
Like you really see what the fuck's
spike Lee is complaining about.

942
00:58:45,941 --> 00:58:47,020
When you fucking see,
it's like,

943
00:58:47,021 --> 00:58:51,730
it's so like how white they
make New York is unbelievable.

944
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:55,030
This just wall the wall.
Fuck everybody's white.

945
00:58:55,630 --> 00:59:00,310
And then at one point though,
gets her grocery stolen.

946
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:04,900
So wretched drivers runs after this car
load of people and out of the car jumps

947
00:59:04,901 --> 00:59:09,070
like two Puerto Ricans and a black guy
and they get fucking Afros and knives.

948
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,730
All of a sudden it turns into death.

949
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:13,450
Wish this chick flick
for like half a second.

950
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:20,260
It's completely unnecessary in the plot
in the movie other than to just remind

951
00:59:20,261 --> 00:59:22,780
why people to be racist.
Um,

952
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:24,980
but that's not what I wanted
to talk about in that movie.

953
00:59:24,981 --> 00:59:29,981
What really interests me in that movie
is I mentioned a zillion times as I drive

954
00:59:30,261 --> 00:59:33,530
a Toyota Prius and uh,

955
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:38,450
when I drive it properly and I'm not
slamming on the brakes and stop it on the

956
00:59:38,451 --> 00:59:43,070
gas, I can get 41 miles per gallon. Okay.

957
00:59:43,850 --> 00:59:47,720
Which is supposed to be good
because a lot of shit gets 23, 25.

958
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:52,040
Now I've maintained for a while.
Now that car's in the 70s,

959
00:59:52,041 --> 00:59:56,840
used to get like 33 35 miles of fucking
gallon. And that's Goddamn almost,

960
00:59:56,841 --> 01:00:01,490
you know, 35, 40 years ago in
this movie, this chick flick,

961
01:00:01,491 --> 01:00:05,860
the goodbye girl, that
chick that, uh, Dreyfus is,

962
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:10,820
is falling for. She's actually, you
guys ever go to a car show, you know,

963
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:14,000
they show all the, uh, whatever this
year they, uh, coming up in October,

964
01:00:14,001 --> 01:00:17,810
they'll start having the car show
and they have all the 2012, um,

965
01:00:17,811 --> 01:00:21,740
models that are coming out and speaking
of models that have these broad standing

966
01:00:21,741 --> 01:00:23,480
next to him,
at least they did back in the day,

967
01:00:23,481 --> 01:00:25,130
unless they consider it too sexist,

968
01:00:25,550 --> 01:00:28,790
they'd have good looking women standing
there talking about the car. So anyways,

969
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:33,230
her character does that in this
movie and it's like, it's like 76,

970
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:35,090
1977,
something like that.

971
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:40,280
And she's standing in front of this
Subaru talking about the car and says it

972
01:00:40,281 --> 01:00:45,230
gets 39 miles per gallon.
All right.

973
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:50,750
See,
this is why I don't believe in Shit.

974
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:54,440
I don't believe in fucking anything.
This is why everybody thinks, oh,

975
01:00:54,441 --> 01:00:58,190
you're paranoid. You're a fucking
conspiracy theory. That's it.

976
01:00:58,191 --> 01:00:59,420
Fucking right there.

977
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:04,540
39 miles per gallon on this fucking all
wheel drive Subaru or are those things

978
01:01:04,821 --> 01:01:08,960
back there weren't oh yeah, four wheel
drive. Subaru got 39 miles per gallon.

979
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:11,930
That was their claim.
Okay.

980
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:17,080
That's 19 fucking 76 or 77
you're telling me in 35 years,

981
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:24,290
the best we've been able to do is get
me an extra two miles per gallon on a

982
01:01:24,291 --> 01:01:28,220
fucking hybrid.
It's complete bullshit.

983
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:33,310
I think there's plenty of fucking oil
and it's the whole thing's horseshit.

984
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:34,430
You know what time I was riding,

985
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:39,110
I was riding in a cab in New York City
and this Pakistanian Dude was driving it,

986
01:01:40,310 --> 01:01:43,220
you know, surprise, surprise. And uh,

987
01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:46,100
I was talking to them about,
I always like,

988
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:49,130
I love talking to people
who don't live here,

989
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:52,280
you know who or who initially
didn't live here and now live here.

990
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:54,950
Just getting their whole viewpoint on
shit. Whether I agree with it or not,

991
01:01:54,951 --> 01:01:57,440
it's just interesting to me.
So I was talking to him,

992
01:01:58,070 --> 01:02:00,860
this is the first time the gas prices
were going through the fucking roof.

993
01:02:00,890 --> 01:02:05,090
And he says to me, he goes, do you
know a Toyota Camry in this country?

994
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:09,740
Gets like whatever the fuck it was at
the time, 2125 miles per gallon. He goes,

995
01:02:09,741 --> 01:02:14,540
do you know in my country it gets
like 38 39 miles per gallon or like 40

996
01:02:14,541 --> 01:02:18,650
something ridiculous. He goes, do you know
why that is? And I said, no. And he goes,

997
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:23,220
because we can't afford a car that gets
23 to 25 miles per gallon because I

998
01:02:23,221 --> 01:02:26,040
guess where they live,
whatever the fucking gas prices are,

999
01:02:26,041 --> 01:02:27,720
whatever their fucking economy is,

1000
01:02:28,290 --> 01:02:32,600
they can't afford a car that
gets that amount of miles.

1001
01:02:32,601 --> 01:02:36,860
So they just adjust the goddamn engine.
That's what I'm saying, people's,

1002
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:37,641
that's all bullshit.

1003
01:02:37,641 --> 01:02:40,640
I don't know where I'm going with this
stuff and I don't know who to complain to.

1004
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:44,150
What about all those
grease monkeys out there?

1005
01:02:44,151 --> 01:02:48,220
You sit there and you watch these
fucking shows on TV where they, they,

1006
01:02:48,221 --> 01:02:53,090
they do like a build. They'll have some
car, you know, like we're at Tate today.

1007
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:57,560
Well, you're not going to believe where
we're going to do. We got a 1972 fucking

1008
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:03,410
GMC Willie's garbage truck and we're going
to combine that with the 1975 Porsche

1009
01:03:03,411 --> 01:03:07,400
nine 11. It's all gonna look fucking
sweet. And they somehow do it.

1010
01:03:08,090 --> 01:03:12,200
The fucking car runs and it fucking got
like nine wheels and he goes flying down

1011
01:03:12,201 --> 01:03:14,270
the street. He's got a fish
tank in the back. Right.

1012
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:19,690
Why don't they use that talent to fuck
with the engine and get it to get it to

1013
01:03:20,061 --> 01:03:20,751
make like,
you know,

1014
01:03:20,751 --> 01:03:24,020
like a hundred miles per gallon or any
of my podcasts listeners out there.

1015
01:03:24,021 --> 01:03:28,540
Do you know how to do that shit?
Is it that fucking hard?

1016
01:03:28,541 --> 01:03:31,450
Isn't it just a couple of twists
of the screwdriver on a carburetor?

1017
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:34,930
Do they have carburetors
anymore? Ah, Christ.

1018
01:03:34,931 --> 01:03:36,970
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking
about. Let's, let's plow ahead.

1019
01:03:36,971 --> 01:03:41,880
Everybody he's getting into
conspiracy theory. Oh Gee, he, um,

1020
01:03:41,990 --> 01:03:46,060
all right, let's go with advice
here. Um, you know, like always,

1021
01:03:46,061 --> 01:03:49,150
somebody sent me one and I can't
remember, uh, with a fuck I put it,

1022
01:03:49,930 --> 01:03:54,930
but some lady came over here from England
and she lives just north of New York

1023
01:03:55,001 --> 01:03:58,630
City. And, uh, she loves living here.

1024
01:03:58,631 --> 01:04:03,240
She loves the excess of America is
what she said, but her husband is,

1025
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:07,450
she said it's driving him nuts because
he's an environmentalist and he is taking

1026
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:12,900
the environmentalist stance to the point
that he won't flush the toilet when he

1027
01:04:13,331 --> 01:04:14,320
just takes a piss.

1028
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:19,780
So she goes walking into the loo as she
calls it and he's got his fucking piss

1029
01:04:19,781 --> 01:04:23,290
in there and she's like, well what do
I do about this is what you do, lady,

1030
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:23,950
you got to tell,

1031
01:04:23,950 --> 01:04:28,950
just put a fucking brick or a stone in
the back of your toilet so you won't use

1032
01:04:29,651 --> 01:04:33,220
as much water and tell the dude
to flush the Goddamn toilet. Okay?

1033
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:34,670
Okay.

1034
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:36,020
Just tell him to flush the toilet.

1035
01:04:36,050 --> 01:04:41,040
I'm all for trying to conserve but
flush the fucking toilet. All right.

1036
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:44,730
And furthermore,
I don't like your attitude though,

1037
01:04:44,910 --> 01:04:46,410
cause she did the classic where,
you know,

1038
01:04:46,411 --> 01:04:50,700
he's doing all this other stuff too for
the environment. Like it's gonna matter.

1039
01:04:51,950 --> 01:04:53,990
I hate people who've got
that defeat us attitude.

1040
01:04:54,170 --> 01:04:57,080
That's not going to fucking matter.
You know,

1041
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:01,010
like when you vote for Ron Paul and they
tell you that you wasted your vote by

1042
01:05:01,011 --> 01:05:03,890
voting for somebody who's
actually being honest,

1043
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:07,460
whether you agree with them or not.
Like that's a wasted vote.

1044
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:11,000
I'll really waste it's a wasted vote to
vote for that guy to try encourage more

1045
01:05:11,001 --> 01:05:15,520
people like that who don't give
a fuck to run for office. No,

1046
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:19,750
he's not gonna so that,
that's why you vote.

1047
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:25,330
You vote cause you want to
vote for a winner. Ah, Jesus.

1048
01:05:25,331 --> 01:05:26,170
That's depressing.

1049
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:30,610
The speaking of fucking depressing the
fucking Stanley Cup finals this year.

1050
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,290
I can anybody figure it out?

1051
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:37,540
I think this has been one of
the most torturous finals, um,

1052
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,870
for fans on both sides.

1053
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:44,830
God knows those connect cons wouldn't
admit to it because now there were up

1054
01:05:44,831 --> 01:05:45,910
three games to two,

1055
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:49,480
but you can't tell me during game
three and four you weren't like,

1056
01:05:49,481 --> 01:05:51,070
what the fuck happened to my team?

1057
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:55,090
Why are they playing like a bunch of
pussies and allowing themselves to be

1058
01:05:55,091 --> 01:05:58,660
pushed all over the ice? That's
what's happened. Every home game.

1059
01:05:58,690 --> 01:06:02,890
The visiting team just gets smashed in
the mouth and does nothing about it.

1060
01:06:02,891 --> 01:06:06,490
It's fucking driving me nuts. All
right, I'm getting sick of you.

1061
01:06:06,491 --> 01:06:08,920
Fucking cannot fans talk and shit

1062
01:06:10,830 --> 01:06:15,090
like your team is fucking superior.
You've won three one goal games.

1063
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:18,390
The twins. What have they done? Shit.

1064
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:24,600
They haven't done shit. What
is Ryan Kessler done? Shit.

1065
01:06:25,410 --> 01:06:26,640
He's done nothing.

1066
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:33,110
What about that fucking that God damn
Lou Longo with his sad basset hound eyes

1067
01:06:34,621 --> 01:06:39,470
behind his goalie mask.
You bunch of punks.

1068
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:43,790
I actually liked your fucking team until
we played you guys in the amount of

1069
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:45,330
shit.
You guys have been talking.

1070
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:50,180
I actually used to like your fucking team.

1071
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:53,380
I would have rooted for the,
if the Bruins weren't in,

1072
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:55,460
I would have wrote it for the
Canucks cause they never won one.

1073
01:06:55,610 --> 01:07:00,610
But their fans are such con oh at their
stupid hankies that they have during the

1074
01:07:01,221 --> 01:07:05,900
Goddamn game. You only people who should
do that. Our Pittsburgh Steeler fans,

1075
01:07:05,901 --> 01:07:08,990
they came up with it. It was the
terrible towel. Anyone else who does it?

1076
01:07:08,991 --> 01:07:13,220
It's fucking gay and I can't wait for
the Bruins win game six and game seven.

1077
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:18,340
So you fucking pussies are crying in
your Goddamn hankies Jesus Christ.

1078
01:07:18,351 --> 01:07:19,010
This is the thing though.

1079
01:07:19,010 --> 01:07:22,370
I actually think they're a great team
and they've got a tremendous amount of

1080
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:23,001
talent on there,

1081
01:07:23,001 --> 01:07:26,540
but those mother fuckers are the cheapest
sons of bitches I've ever seen in my

1082
01:07:26,541 --> 01:07:31,250
life. I don't mind the hits. I
don't mind that shit. You know,

1083
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:36,080
it happens. All right. But the fucking,

1084
01:07:36,170 --> 01:07:41,150
the diving and the flopping.
Hey, I asked this the other day,

1085
01:07:41,510 --> 01:07:45,410
uh, I was on Tsn, which
is the ESPN up in Canada.

1086
01:07:45,890 --> 01:07:49,670
I called in and I asked this,
can some hockey fan please explain to me.

1087
01:07:50,990 --> 01:07:55,790
All right. And one of the Games, the
last game actually gained five all right.

1088
01:07:55,890 --> 01:08:00,890
There at the lining up for a face off
in a Burroughs is right next to Luke

1089
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:01,220
Cheech.

1090
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:05,540
So what he does is he puts his leg in
front of Lucita stick and then just does a

1091
01:08:06,030 --> 01:08:10,070
prat fall and acts like he trips.
Okay.

1092
01:08:10,970 --> 01:08:15,050
Now, I would think that either he get
two minutes for diving or they would call

1093
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:18,170
Cheech for tripping because they
didn't realize that, you know,

1094
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:19,640
that they got faked out.

1095
01:08:19,641 --> 01:08:24,641
But for some reason Lou Cheech got two
minutes for tripping and Burroughs get

1096
01:08:24,771 --> 01:08:29,660
two minutes for embellishment or something
stupid like that. I don't get that.

1097
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:34,220
It's like he either fucking trip the guy
redundant. What does that penalty mean?

1098
01:08:34,221 --> 01:08:38,450
Like, okay, he tripped you but
he didn't trip you that bad.

1099
01:08:39,710 --> 01:08:42,980
I don't know.
I've had it in the fucking goddamn twins.

1100
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:49,160
Jesus Christ did [inaudible]
flopping all over the fucking ice.

1101
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:51,770
That's how you want to win a cup,
Vancouver.

1102
01:08:51,771 --> 01:08:55,220
That's how you want to do it
by pretending you got hurt.

1103
01:08:56,350 --> 01:08:57,050
Yeah.

1104
01:08:57,050 --> 01:09:01,370
Fucking shameless.
Just a shameless fucking hockey team.

1105
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:02,710
I got no,

1106
01:09:02,710 --> 01:09:06,320
I'd have absolutely no fucking respect
for like I've lost all fucking respect

1107
01:09:06,321 --> 01:09:08,120
for that Goddamn team
and I can't believe it.

1108
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:11,240
There's no fucking reason for
them to be doing that shit.

1109
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:12,920
They got enough weapons.

1110
01:09:13,670 --> 01:09:17,030
They sort of have a good goaltender
and there were great physical team.

1111
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:21,540
Why do you gotta play like fags?
You know?

1112
01:09:22,590 --> 01:09:24,990
Why is that what you guys
do out there in Vancouver?

1113
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:28,680
Is that what you do when you're not
going out on a fucking whale watch and

1114
01:09:28,681 --> 01:09:29,100
listen to,

1115
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:33,470
to your euro trash music with your awful
tight clothes that you wear up there at

1116
01:09:33,630 --> 01:09:37,080
been to Vancouver for about 20 minutes.
Beautiful scenery.

1117
01:09:37,110 --> 01:09:39,580
If you're not looking at the people,
um,

1118
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:48,250
uh, I can't wait to play
Tampa or Vancouver just for
the fan that actually takes

1119
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:52,530
this shit seriously. Um,
anyways, plowing ahead,

1120
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:55,220
plowing ahead.
Speaking of a,

1121
01:09:57,750 --> 01:10:02,340
speaking of what the fuck was I talking
about? Oh, gay and all that type of stuff.

1122
01:10:02,370 --> 01:10:06,750
A certain comedian got into a bunch of
trouble for a bunch of stuff he said

1123
01:10:06,751 --> 01:10:08,370
during a, during a, uh,

1124
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:11,940
during a standup performance and uh,

1125
01:10:11,970 --> 01:10:16,890
people got offended and a, this really
bugged me. I was watching a news program.

1126
01:10:17,670 --> 01:10:21,750
I was watching a program that involved
the news and this dude came on and the

1127
01:10:21,751 --> 01:10:26,751
comedian apologized and they asked
him what he thought he could go in.

1128
01:10:26,821 --> 01:10:29,580
The guy was just like, well, you
know, I think the apology was good,

1129
01:10:29,581 --> 01:10:30,870
but I don't think it's enough.

1130
01:10:30,871 --> 01:10:35,500
I think he should donate some money
to the fucking blah, blah, blah, blah,

1131
01:10:35,501 --> 01:10:38,700
blah. And it just, it just killed
the whole fucking thing for me.

1132
01:10:39,810 --> 01:10:44,160
It killed the outrage. I should really
just look at the guy at that. It's like,

1133
01:10:44,161 --> 01:10:45,150
really at the end of it,

1134
01:10:45,151 --> 01:10:49,420
all you want to do is just get some
fucking money out of the guy. You know? I,

1135
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:52,020
I don't understand that.
I really don't.

1136
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:58,350
You know, somebody does something and then
they apologize. That should be enough.

1137
01:10:58,520 --> 01:10:59,430
You got,
that's not enough.

1138
01:10:59,431 --> 01:11:02,990
You've got to take the money out
of his fucking wallet, you know?

1139
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:06,660
So if that's the case, then you really
don't give a shit about the apology.

1140
01:11:06,661 --> 01:11:08,490
You just want it.
So you just using it as an,

1141
01:11:08,491 --> 01:11:12,870
as an excuse to get some fucking money.
Right?

1142
01:11:13,690 --> 01:11:15,340
Yeah. Does that make any
fucking sense? I Dunno.

1143
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:19,120
I'm basically judging the entire topic
because of that one Douche I saw on TV.

1144
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:22,300
All right, let's plow ahead here before
I have to fucking apologize to somebody.

1145
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:28,770
Um, uh, people of Vancouver.
Do you think that is his,

1146
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:32,350
his apology that he made fun of
your white belts and white shoes,

1147
01:11:32,530 --> 01:11:35,950
your herb Tarlek euro trash way of
fucking dressing at your dance clubs?

1148
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:40,840
The fact that he apologized,
was that enough? Um, I don't
think it's quite enough.

1149
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:44,680
I think he should make a
donation to the Vancouver,

1150
01:11:44,710 --> 01:11:48,280
a mountainous region. Ag. Go Fuck
Yourself. All right, dear bill,

1151
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:53,170
I am from Kansas City and there is
currently radio commercials in which a law

1152
01:11:53,171 --> 01:11:56,410
officer, a law, a law office,

1153
01:11:56,411 --> 01:12:01,270
offers their services exclusively for
women going through a divorce. Of course,

1154
01:12:01,271 --> 01:12:03,340
they do this a ton of
money involved there. Uh,

1155
01:12:03,341 --> 01:12:08,110
they talk about how they were view all
of the husband's finances and ensure the

1156
01:12:08,111 --> 01:12:12,400
woman will receive the maximum
amount the law will allow.

1157
01:12:13,330 --> 01:12:14,950
And then he writes in capital letters.

1158
01:12:14,951 --> 01:12:19,951
What the fuck are there any law offices
that offer services exclusively for men?

1159
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:24,070
I doubted if there were,

1160
01:12:24,071 --> 01:12:29,071
I would imagine there would be a huge
protest from feminists all across the U S

1161
01:12:30,010 --> 01:12:32,710
I know you've addressed
this hundreds of times over,

1162
01:12:32,950 --> 01:12:37,950
but why is it okay k to completely fuck
a man over this commercial insinuates

1163
01:12:40,181 --> 01:12:44,980
the man is already in the wrong.
This is absolute bullshit dude.

1164
01:12:44,981 --> 01:12:48,910
Yet preach on this guys is
speaking the Gospel here. Anyways,

1165
01:12:48,911 --> 01:12:51,070
wanted to share this with you as,

1166
01:12:51,071 --> 01:12:55,270
this is just another example
of man bashing commercials.
That just pissed me off.

1167
01:12:56,860 --> 01:13:01,480
Um, all right, let's, let's, let's review
this. Ah, yeah. Okay. First of all,

1168
01:13:01,570 --> 01:13:04,250
he can't get mad at the lawyers because a,

1169
01:13:04,310 --> 01:13:09,220
they're just going with the monies and um,
and as you,

1170
01:13:09,430 --> 01:13:10,690
as you,
as you say that,

1171
01:13:10,691 --> 01:13:15,691
if it was the opposite way that there
would be feminist groups protesting.

1172
01:13:16,810 --> 01:13:17,643
All right.

1173
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:22,920
That there in lies the fucking problem
until men actually get together and start

1174
01:13:25,291 --> 01:13:26,970
protesting that type of shit,

1175
01:13:27,330 --> 01:13:31,380
which I would absolutely love to
be a part of on any fucking level.

1176
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:35,460
I would love to see that happen.
But what guys,

1177
01:13:35,461 --> 01:13:39,720
we don't do that shit once we get you
get punched in the face. Yeah. Fuck you.

1178
01:13:39,721 --> 01:13:42,960
You get up and you walk away. Like
you can't do that. Like, yeah,

1179
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:48,070
this should be guys protesting it. I
think that would be fucking hilarious. Um,

1180
01:13:50,310 --> 01:13:51,840
that's absolutely terrifying.

1181
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:57,990
That's one of 9 million reasons
why I never got fucking married.

1182
01:13:58,530 --> 01:14:00,510
That is just unfucking believable.

1183
01:14:01,410 --> 01:14:01,910
Yeah.

1184
01:14:01,910 --> 01:14:05,210
You know, I'll tell you what kills me
is most women who would watch that,

1185
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:08,090
they always say the same thing. When
you liked, you'll say to them like,

1186
01:14:08,091 --> 01:14:10,700
can you believe that shit when they
always say that saint? Yup. That's right.

1187
01:14:11,350 --> 01:14:13,180
That's right. Yeah. That's what you get.

1188
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:18,310
That's what you get a big,
stupid face. What the fuck?

1189
01:14:18,311 --> 01:14:20,890
Have you ever done that?
That's my whole,

1190
01:14:22,210 --> 01:14:26,530
my whole thing with dad is just a,
I don't know,

1191
01:14:26,531 --> 01:14:29,590
you get married, you just better
pray to God. It fucking works out.

1192
01:14:29,591 --> 01:14:34,000
There's a guy that's all you have
and the amount of power, it's not,

1193
01:14:34,030 --> 01:14:38,140
it's not a balanced relationship because
of the way that the divorce laws are.

1194
01:14:38,380 --> 01:14:42,280
It's the second, you know,
it's like when your single,

1195
01:14:42,490 --> 01:14:45,130
you have an unbelievable
amount of power as a guy,

1196
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:48,100
even if you're in a relationship,
because

1197
01:14:50,610 --> 01:14:53,440
that she, she can't get to you
legally. That's it. It's fucking over.

1198
01:14:53,441 --> 01:14:54,970
You have your shit and that's it.

1199
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:59,710
And you're a guy and you can earn
a fucking living and that's it.

1200
01:15:00,220 --> 01:15:02,680
You don't have to worry about shit.
And then the second you get married,

1201
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:05,320
you lose all power.

1202
01:15:05,530 --> 01:15:07,990
Cause at any point should she can just
divorce you and fucking take you for

1203
01:15:07,991 --> 01:15:11,140
everything. You're worth, everything
you work for. It's, it's just,

1204
01:15:11,141 --> 01:15:12,820
it's fucking over.
Look at tiger woods.

1205
01:15:14,290 --> 01:15:18,100
Tiger Woods gave his wife a
quarter of a billion dollars.

1206
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:23,230
She was a nanny. Fucking
nanny were what? Nine figures

1207
01:15:25,230 --> 01:15:30,000
for what she, he had a prenup was
she was only going to get $5 million,

1208
01:15:30,210 --> 01:15:31,950
only $5 million.

1209
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:35,520
Who here wouldn't kill for $5 million?

1210
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:39,840
I quit my podcast for a fucking 200 grand.

1211
01:15:44,670 --> 01:15:47,340
You know,
you find out your husband,

1212
01:15:47,341 --> 01:15:51,690
some dog going around
cheating or whatever. That's,

1213
01:15:52,290 --> 01:15:53,400
that happens to women.

1214
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:58,140
And the guy's a broke ass son of a
bitch and they're left with nothing.

1215
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:01,340
So it's not like women always make out,
but here's the situation.

1216
01:16:01,430 --> 01:16:05,070
We find that your husband's a
dog. The marriage is over. Oh,

1217
01:16:05,071 --> 01:16:06,780
but I get $5 million,

1218
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:10,860
but that's not enough for the cont
cause she knows he has a billion and she

1219
01:16:10,861 --> 01:16:15,060
wants to get as much as that as she can.
I swear to fucking God,

1220
01:16:15,570 --> 01:16:19,230
I can't do these topics because it
makes you see red because they're not

1221
01:16:19,231 --> 01:16:23,140
entitled to it. It's bullshit. All right?

1222
01:16:23,141 --> 01:16:28,141
If you marry the greatest golfer of a
fucking generation who's won 14 titles,

1223
01:16:30,010 --> 01:16:34,030
okay. And you haven't even won a game,
a tiddly winks on a professional level,

1224
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:38,260
you're not entitled to that money. You're
not. You are illegally, but you're not.

1225
01:16:38,261 --> 01:16:41,830
You didn't fucking earn it. You
can't. Ah, right. There you go, Bill.

1226
01:16:41,831 --> 01:16:45,820
Get to the core of the hatred.
All right, number two. Um,

1227
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:47,110
Bill,

1228
01:16:47,110 --> 01:16:52,110
really the fucking new Norwegians get
you for multiple gigs and London gets one

1229
01:16:52,391 --> 01:16:56,740
night. Uh, you know how you know
they hate, wait a minute too.

1230
01:16:56,741 --> 01:17:00,680
What are you talking about?
The Norwegians. Okay.

1231
01:17:00,681 --> 01:17:02,690
You're talking about the
whole Scandinavian area.

1232
01:17:02,691 --> 01:17:05,210
I'm in a different country every night.
I'm an,

1233
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:10,070
I'm an England one night than Finland
than Norway, Norway than and then Sweden.

1234
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:15,590
All right. That's totally equal.
What are you bitching about? Uh,

1235
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:19,370
not to mention I already played London
and I, the place was three quarters full.

1236
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:22,760
I don't think I need to do a week
of dates there in front of nine,

1237
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:27,970
nine people per show. Um, alright bill.
Really the fucking Norwegians get you.

1238
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:31,010
Get you for multiple gigs in London.
Gets one night.

1239
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:32,470
Yeah.

1240
01:17:32,470 --> 01:17:34,000
And I can't even,
I don't know what he says here.

1241
01:17:34,030 --> 01:17:38,350
You know they hate America
Q over in Sweden too, right?

1242
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:42,670
What does that m e R I C U h l have to
look that up. I don't know what that is.

1243
01:17:42,910 --> 01:17:46,900
Are you trying to fill some sort of
urge to pal around with people who are

1244
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:51,190
whiter than yourself? Well then
look no further than London, sir.

1245
01:17:51,370 --> 01:17:56,230
They are so white. They eat their
pizza with forks and knives. Um,

1246
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,660
you what you think because
you've been here before.

1247
01:17:58,661 --> 01:18:01,000
You can just do London
in a night and peace out.

1248
01:18:01,330 --> 01:18:05,470
I use some sort of Anglo expert now.
I'm just fucking around.

1249
01:18:05,471 --> 01:18:09,490
Glad you give in London at least one
night. Look forward to seeing you figures.

1250
01:18:09,491 --> 01:18:10,780
I discover your con,
uh,

1251
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:14,920
comedy after I move out to Los Angeles
while I'm out here in Los Angeles. Sir,

1252
01:18:15,820 --> 01:18:17,780
if you'd like to see me,
I'm doing a,

1253
01:18:17,781 --> 01:18:22,781
a benefit for a Greg Geraldo's wife
and a family at the Wiltern theater.

1254
01:18:25,090 --> 01:18:29,020
Um, what the hell's the fucking
date? Ah, Jesus. They're built.

1255
01:18:29,770 --> 01:18:34,440
How do you not know where
the fuck you gonna be? Oh,

1256
01:18:34,441 --> 01:18:37,990
you know what? I know when
the fuck it is. It's uh,

1257
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:43,350
June 29th at the Wiltern theater. All
right. Not only can you see me, sorry.

1258
01:18:43,351 --> 01:18:46,030
You can see a bunch of other comics
doing their fucking thing. All right,

1259
01:18:46,031 --> 01:18:49,570
Jeff Ross is going to be out there.
Slappy white.

1260
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:54,240
We're going to have a bunch of big names.
I'm all right. What is, oh, I can see.

1261
01:18:54,250 --> 01:18:55,640
Email wasn't done here.
By the way,

1262
01:18:55,641 --> 01:18:58,760
that email you read from that guy who
claimed to be French at a bunch of

1263
01:18:58,761 --> 01:19:01,040
condescending misinformation in it.
Right?

1264
01:19:01,041 --> 01:19:04,940
That guy back and tell him he's a prick
just like all the rest of the French, uh,

1265
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:10,070
per regions or otherwise. Francis full
of garlic, eating pseudo mustache,

1266
01:19:10,071 --> 01:19:14,450
having dickheads. Granted there women
are clean shaven though. Uh, too bad.

1267
01:19:14,451 --> 01:19:16,850
The majority of them look
like dudes regardless.

1268
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:21,820
Okay.

1269
01:19:21,820 --> 01:19:25,150
Now why do you think he's saying all that
shit people? Do you know why that is?

1270
01:19:25,180 --> 01:19:27,850
It's because his country,
his next to France,

1271
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:31,600
nobody likes the country.
They're next to write.

1272
01:19:31,810 --> 01:19:36,810
Although I do like Canada except for a
Canadian Martirio Canadian fence and uh,

1273
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:43,590
even Vancouver connect fans
with your hankies. Okay. In
your prayer. False eight.

1274
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:45,640
When they,
all those pratfalls that they do,

1275
01:19:45,641 --> 01:19:49,290
do they play like a Benny Hill music
at the beginning of the, of uh,

1276
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:50,860
whenever Vancouver has a home game,

1277
01:19:51,550 --> 01:19:54,400
when they show the highlights and they
got Wayne Wayne man pick a Dane, Dane,

1278
01:19:54,630 --> 01:19:55,990
an amp,
amp and name and name an nap.

1279
01:19:55,991 --> 01:19:58,630
And then you show everybody
flopping around on the fucking ice

1280
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:01,820
laughing cause they're cheating.

1281
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:05,510
Okay,

1282
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:09,000
you got a hell of a team and you
might the cup. But Jesus Christ.

1283
01:20:09,210 --> 01:20:12,300
How about next year?
How about next year?

1284
01:20:12,301 --> 01:20:17,301
You make some sort of vow that you're
going to have some sort of fucking code of

1285
01:20:18,061 --> 01:20:22,560
honors, something. Jesus.
His whole fucking series.

1286
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:24,540
Which one of the sendings was it?

1287
01:20:24,630 --> 01:20:29,370
Was it that fucking flopped onto his
back and the ref didn't even call it?

1288
01:20:29,371 --> 01:20:32,520
And when he got up, someone on the Bruins
were going, was going, are you okay?

1289
01:20:32,770 --> 01:20:37,440
Y'All right. Everything okay? Oh
Jesus. What a bunch of pussies.

1290
01:20:38,770 --> 01:20:41,160
Um, alright. Overrated.
Underrated for this.

1291
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:44,100
Wreak a underrated
jerking off on the clock.

1292
01:20:46,830 --> 01:20:49,080
Everyone should do this
once in their lifetime.

1293
01:20:49,081 --> 01:20:53,400
You might as well be getting blow
by what? By your boss's wife. Oh,

1294
01:20:53,401 --> 01:20:57,000
that's fucking hilarious.
Yeah, but where do you do it?

1295
01:20:57,030 --> 01:21:01,260
And then the odds are getting caught.
That's a, that's part of the excitement.

1296
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:06,090
Fucking Weirdo jerking off at
work were where exactly. Oh,

1297
01:21:06,091 --> 01:21:10,320
jerking off on the clock. Oh, I
see. So what, uh, you know what?

1298
01:21:10,321 --> 01:21:13,920
I'm going home for lunch. Then you go
back and you jerk off. Oh, but on lunch,

1299
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:16,980
you know on the clock,
sir, could you please are,

1300
01:21:17,010 --> 01:21:20,820
could you please elaborate and let me
know where exactly it is that you jerk off

1301
01:21:21,270 --> 01:21:25,310
at work. Any of my listeners and you
guys, you have a jerk off at work has,

1302
01:21:25,470 --> 01:21:28,170
is this what the podcast is this
what it really has come down to.

1303
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:33,450
Anybody else ever rub one out at fucking
work and when you do, what do you go?

1304
01:21:33,451 --> 01:21:37,280
Obviously the bathroom.
Wow.

1305
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:39,500
I mean you really risking
your fucking career there.

1306
01:21:40,250 --> 01:21:41,750
If you get caught rubbing one out.

1307
01:21:43,460 --> 01:21:48,290
I'm trying to think of a job that you
could have where you could get caught

1308
01:21:48,291 --> 01:21:52,970
rubbing one out at work and people would
laugh it off. Obviously a comedian,

1309
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:55,010
you know,
if you will rub it,

1310
01:21:55,011 --> 01:21:57,560
went out in the green room as
long as you sold the rum out.

1311
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:03,590
You know, that's the amazing
thing about show business.

1312
01:22:04,490 --> 01:22:06,530
I was thinking about this shit
the other day, that if you,

1313
01:22:06,730 --> 01:22:09,380
if say you killed somebody,
you committed murder,

1314
01:22:10,430 --> 01:22:14,560
but it was judged a crime of passion.
You know,

1315
01:22:14,590 --> 01:22:16,510
you lost your shit,
you fucking killed somebody.

1316
01:22:16,511 --> 01:22:21,280
So you go in a jail for at least 15 years.
Okay, so 15 years, 17 years you get out,

1317
01:22:22,180 --> 01:22:25,480
where are you going to get a Goddamn job?
Okay.

1318
01:22:25,510 --> 01:22:29,320
Other than just continuing
to be a criminal, you know,

1319
01:22:29,321 --> 01:22:32,910
selling drugs or some shit. You know,
there's only two places that you,

1320
01:22:33,020 --> 01:22:36,820
I think that you can get a job.
You can become like a car salesman

1321
01:22:38,350 --> 01:22:42,920
cause they don't give a fuck, you know,
or you can get into show business.

1322
01:22:44,820 --> 01:22:47,610
It's fucking amazing. You can cut, you
can do a little walk right out of prison.

1323
01:22:47,611 --> 01:22:51,300
If anybody is in prison
listening to this shit. You know,

1324
01:22:51,690 --> 01:22:55,560
if you have these privileges,
you can get out of prison,

1325
01:22:56,790 --> 01:22:59,550
you know,
after doing 17 years.

1326
01:22:59,551 --> 01:23:03,360
And then they hand you your fucking Xe
Kava cheese that you wore when you walked

1327
01:23:03,361 --> 01:23:05,740
into prison back and fucking 1993

1328
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:13,430
with your goatee. And I can't believe Kurt
Cobain just killed himself. Tee Shirt,

1329
01:23:13,460 --> 01:23:16,280
right?
Within a week,

1330
01:23:17,430 --> 01:23:19,860
you could sign up for [inaudible],
right? First fucking day,

1331
01:23:19,861 --> 01:23:21,510
you go out to sign up for an open mic.

1332
01:23:21,780 --> 01:23:25,350
You could write five minutes
material and you could be on stage

1333
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:31,140
telling jokes within a fucking week.
And not only could you be,

1334
01:23:31,710 --> 01:23:36,060
not only would you be accepted when other
comedians found out that you murdered

1335
01:23:36,061 --> 01:23:40,410
somebody, their reaction
wouldn't be like, holy fuck,

1336
01:23:40,650 --> 01:23:42,900
you're a piece of shit. They
would just be like, dude, dude,

1337
01:23:42,901 --> 01:23:46,530
you should talk about that on stage.
That, that could be your hook, man.

1338
01:23:46,650 --> 01:23:50,040
You go up in your orange jumpsuit,
right?

1339
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:52,380
You let people know that you killed
somebody. And then first of all,

1340
01:23:52,381 --> 01:23:53,670
no one's going to fucking hackle.
Yeah.

1341
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,490
And then he can intimidate the crowd
that if they don't laugh at your jokes,

1342
01:23:56,491 --> 01:23:59,640
you're going to go be a
fuck. Do it again. You know,

1343
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:03,360
I was actually talking to somebody about
that the other day about, you know,

1344
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:07,830
that's, that's a conversation
that guys have a lot about.

1345
01:24:07,831 --> 01:24:11,820
Do you think you could survive
if you went to prison? And, uh,

1346
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:16,590
I was talking to Keith
Robinson, uh, about this shit.

1347
01:24:17,940 --> 01:24:18,773
And,
uh,

1348
01:24:19,290 --> 01:24:24,290
I was telling him that I would go into
prison and I would immediately joined the

1349
01:24:24,641 --> 01:24:26,890
area nation immediately.
I would,

1350
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:31,320
I would have a bic pen out if I
smuggled it in. I wouldn't have,

1351
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:34,000
would be drawing the
swastika between my eyes,

1352
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:36,640
not because I believe in that shit.
I just don't want to get raped.

1353
01:24:38,830 --> 01:24:39,663
So

1354
01:24:39,690 --> 01:24:42,960
I would be drawing that in on
the bus ride into the prison.

1355
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:47,790
And I told Keith, you know, no offense
that if I did see him in prison,

1356
01:24:47,820 --> 01:24:51,660
I would have to call them the n
word. I just would just, you know,

1357
01:24:51,661 --> 01:24:54,630
not out of some racist shit.
I just, I would not want,

1358
01:24:54,631 --> 01:24:59,080
I just don't want to get raped and
I have to bond with the fucking, uh,

1359
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:00,480
the psycho a,

1360
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:09,220
the psycho fucking, uh, what do you
call them? What do you call those guys?

1361
01:25:09,250 --> 01:25:10,300
The white supremacists.

1362
01:25:11,290 --> 01:25:14,440
And I'd have to sit there
listening to their awful music.

1363
01:25:15,030 --> 01:25:16,930
I remember that from American history.

1364
01:25:16,931 --> 01:25:21,931
X rent with that fatty was in the
van singing the white man marches.

1365
01:25:25,890 --> 01:25:30,480
Oh, would I be counting down
the fucking days? Jesus Christ.

1366
01:25:30,570 --> 01:25:34,040
But you'd have to do it.
You'd have to do it.

1367
01:25:34,041 --> 01:25:38,720
You'd have to become a full on fucking
area in maniac. But what are your,

1368
01:25:38,721 --> 01:25:43,540
what are your options? You know?
I mean, I'm all for, you know,

1369
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,180
not being racist,
100% all about it.

1370
01:25:49,510 --> 01:25:51,460
I think it's ignorant and
all that type of shit,

1371
01:25:51,461 --> 01:25:55,990
but I draw the line at getting fucked
in the ass. All right, fuck that.

1372
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:58,270
Fuck that noise,
son.

1373
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:03,440
I'll say some shit that will make
fucking a Charles Manson blush.

1374
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:07,010
Ah,
well maybe that's the guy I'd knock out,

1375
01:26:08,090 --> 01:26:11,450
can walking up to him with his vampire
fingernails and just fucking slap the

1376
01:26:11,451 --> 01:26:13,520
beard right off his face.
Maybe that would prevent it.

1377
01:26:13,550 --> 01:26:16,550
I don't know if anybody's ever
been to prison. What exactly?

1378
01:26:16,551 --> 01:26:21,551
Someone like me right before I commit to
going in there and just shaving my head

1379
01:26:22,251 --> 01:26:23,240
and acting like a,

1380
01:26:23,241 --> 01:26:27,260
I'm part of the area in nation because
that's the only way I see, you know,

1381
01:26:28,220 --> 01:26:29,001
getting out of it.

1382
01:26:29,001 --> 01:26:31,910
If anybody who's been listening
to this shit has been to prison,

1383
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:33,860
how does a Ron Howard,

1384
01:26:33,861 --> 01:26:38,861
Ralph mouth looking jackass like myself
who hasn't had a fist fight since junior

1385
01:26:39,681 --> 01:26:44,570
high outside of his family?
Um,

1386
01:26:45,620 --> 01:26:48,740
how do, how do you
survive? How do you do it?

1387
01:26:50,270 --> 01:26:53,740
And that's the only option I can think. I
got to go in there and I, I got to hang,

1388
01:26:54,850 --> 01:26:59,680
oh Jesus. Then I'd have to get
a bunch of awful tattoos. Ah,

1389
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:05,270
AH, Jesus Christ. I'd
probably just kill myself.

1390
01:27:06,890 --> 01:27:08,150
That's what I was joking about that.

1391
01:27:08,151 --> 01:27:12,260
But then I wouldn't have the nerve to do
it and then I'd get raped and then I'd

1392
01:27:12,261 --> 01:27:14,780
be thinking as I was getting raped going,
fuck,

1393
01:27:14,781 --> 01:27:17,300
I should've done it earlier
because now I got to kill myself.

1394
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:21,000
It's fucking unreal. So anyways, whenever
you see these fucking people, when they,

1395
01:27:21,001 --> 01:27:25,130
they,
I remember long time ago there was some,

1396
01:27:25,131 --> 01:27:28,250
like some kid in New York City,

1397
01:27:28,340 --> 01:27:30,770
it was this classic case where he,

1398
01:27:31,730 --> 01:27:36,730
he killed his girlfriend and he said that
they were having rough sex and it got

1399
01:27:37,791 --> 01:27:42,710
out of control. Right. Which is complete
horseshit. He killed her. Right.

1400
01:27:42,740 --> 01:27:45,380
But that's what he said.
So anyways,

1401
01:27:45,410 --> 01:27:49,490
he ended up doing all of his time
because he kept getting busted for shit.

1402
01:27:50,150 --> 01:27:54,290
So when he was getting a in prison,
so like they were talking about, uh,

1403
01:27:55,700 --> 01:27:57,740
they were talking about him getting out.

1404
01:27:57,741 --> 01:27:58,970
I remember he was getting
out and they're like,

1405
01:27:58,971 --> 01:28:02,580
so and so's getting out of
prison, the, you know, the
famous case, blah, blah, blah,

1406
01:28:02,690 --> 01:28:03,523
blah,
blah.

1407
01:28:03,650 --> 01:28:07,370
And evidently he was quite a busy man
when he was in prison and they start

1408
01:28:07,371 --> 01:28:08,270
giving him shit going.

1409
01:28:08,271 --> 01:28:11,990
Like he got busted on numerous
occasions for selling drugs.

1410
01:28:12,530 --> 01:28:17,530
He got into a couple of altercations
with the guards and other inmates and

1411
01:28:17,901 --> 01:28:21,710
they're talking about him like, he should
have been there coloring. It's like, no,

1412
01:28:21,711 --> 01:28:26,711
he was doing what he had to do so he
didn't become somebody's girlfriend.

1413
01:28:28,850 --> 01:28:33,530
I hate when people do that when they
talk about people not behaving nicely in

1414
01:28:33,531 --> 01:28:38,210
prison as if that's a place where that
is an option. I saw a guy one time,

1415
01:28:38,211 --> 01:28:41,210
he was saying that I'm one
of those prisons shows.

1416
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:46,320
He was talking about how whenever
this they're coming into Yoursel, uh,

1417
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:49,610
they give you the option
where you, you, you put your,

1418
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:54,700
you put your back to the door and then
they reach it and they handcuff you and

1419
01:28:55,011 --> 01:28:56,330
he's saying you can't do that.
He goes,

1420
01:28:56,450 --> 01:29:00,200
you're options are basically you back
up like a bitch to the door and then all

1421
01:29:00,201 --> 01:29:03,810
the other inmates look at you like
you're a bitch or you fight him.

1422
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:09,470
So what, what are you
supposed to do? You got you.

1423
01:29:09,471 --> 01:29:14,070
So you basically have to take a beat
down from these fucking officers who

1424
01:29:14,420 --> 01:29:18,890
address like robocop so that they
don't rape you cause your bag just,

1425
01:29:18,891 --> 01:29:21,950
it's fucking horrific.
It's absolutely horrific.

1426
01:29:22,790 --> 01:29:26,780
And the fact that I've blown off jury
duty for the last fucking 16 months,

1427
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:29,540
speaking of being racist,

1428
01:29:29,541 --> 01:29:33,080
that's one that people always
say like to get out of jury duty.

1429
01:29:33,140 --> 01:29:34,610
Like they always just go in there.

1430
01:29:34,611 --> 01:29:37,520
You just go in there and you
just say a bunch of racist shit.

1431
01:29:38,330 --> 01:29:41,420
I love when people like, they think that
that's how you do it. It's like, you know,

1432
01:29:41,421 --> 01:29:44,810
yeah, war or you could just ignore
it when it comes in the mail.

1433
01:29:44,811 --> 01:29:46,040
You just don't respond to it.

1434
01:29:46,041 --> 01:29:49,790
You could always do that as opposed to
going down to the courthouse and just

1435
01:29:49,791 --> 01:29:54,630
saying racist shit. You know,
you're, you're overthinking it.

1436
01:29:55,700 --> 01:30:00,540
All right. Where the hell am I? Um,
overrated. Uh, American football,

1437
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:05,970
even the name is inaccurate. Uh,
Mexicans don't play it. Brazilians don't.

1438
01:30:05,971 --> 01:30:08,580
Argentine teens don't.
Hmm.

1439
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:12,810
Come Canadians don't play it much. No,
they do play it. They have a whole league.

1440
01:30:12,811 --> 01:30:16,710
You can't, you just too dumbed the name
of another country. How about Venezuela?

1441
01:30:17,070 --> 01:30:21,780
Dumb. Fuck. Um, and here's the crucial
bit, nor does the rest of the world.

1442
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:26,460
This is a game where the super bowl
is played only by American teams,

1443
01:30:26,461 --> 01:30:28,610
yet they call themselves world champs.
Dude,

1444
01:30:28,611 --> 01:30:30,330
this is one of the oldest
arguments I've ever heard.

1445
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:35,310
Even the World Cup events of hockey,
rugby and rock,

1446
01:30:35,311 --> 01:30:37,920
paper, scissors. Yes. That's a real event.

1447
01:30:37,921 --> 01:30:42,030
Invite competitors for
more than two nations. Uh,

1448
01:30:42,031 --> 01:30:45,480
it's one of these few sports
who's all American heroes?

1449
01:30:45,481 --> 01:30:47,460
From Joe Montana to Walter Payton.

1450
01:30:47,940 --> 01:30:52,080
We're a bunch of guys who only played
against their compatriots. Well,

1451
01:30:52,081 --> 01:30:52,711
you know what?

1452
01:30:52,711 --> 01:30:57,660
If you pussies want to put together a
team and try and join the NFL, I mean,

1453
01:30:57,661 --> 01:31:01,410
they play a game in London every year
trying to get you guys interested in it.

1454
01:31:01,411 --> 01:31:03,240
You're not interested in the fucking game,

1455
01:31:03,870 --> 01:31:06,990
and I guarantee whatever
fucking team you put together,

1456
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:08,610
we'll kick the shit out of you.

1457
01:31:08,611 --> 01:31:12,390
Just like we have in basketball
are fucking sport. You can't

1458
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:20,610
the fuck do you get off? Talking about
football is a, you know what football is?

1459
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:23,760
Football is the correction to soccer.
See,

1460
01:31:24,390 --> 01:31:29,160
Americans were smart enough to realize
how goddamn boring you're you're fucking

1461
01:31:29,161 --> 01:31:34,050
sport is. And you want to talk about
a bunch of people diving. I actually,

1462
01:31:34,051 --> 01:31:35,130
I'm going to take it back.

1463
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:39,420
I'm going to actually apologize to the
Vancouver Canucks for suggesting that

1464
01:31:39,421 --> 01:31:42,660
they were diving on an insane level.
Okay?

1465
01:31:43,740 --> 01:31:47,340
Professional soccer players take
it to an entirely different level.

1466
01:31:48,460 --> 01:31:51,810
All right? Every time somebody
comes up and barely touches you,

1467
01:31:51,930 --> 01:31:56,280
you act like he just got thrown out of a
fucking car and you sit there with your

1468
01:31:56,281 --> 01:32:01,281
scarves singing songs cause you're so
goddamn board waiting for a fucking goal

1469
01:32:02,621 --> 01:32:03,454
to be scored.

1470
01:32:05,070 --> 01:32:08,700
What would happen if you actually pick
the Goddamn ball up and ran with it?

1471
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:11,280
It'd be exciting.
Like rugby.

1472
01:32:11,670 --> 01:32:15,630
Rugby is exciting as opposed
to soccer or football,

1473
01:32:15,631 --> 01:32:19,800
whatever the fuck you call it, and I
know what you're saying like, yeah,

1474
01:32:19,830 --> 01:32:22,860
but in rugby they're not pussies.
They don't wear helmets. Yeah.

1475
01:32:22,861 --> 01:32:26,580
They don't hit each other as hard either.
I've watched it. I've watched both.

1476
01:32:26,581 --> 01:32:30,960
I think they're both awesome sports
to watch. Both of them make me cringe,

1477
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:35,400
but the American game is way faster and
way more fucking violent. It just is.

1478
01:32:35,710 --> 01:32:36,543
All right.

1479
01:32:36,570 --> 01:32:41,010
Our football players are actually dying
in their 50s and donating their brains

1480
01:32:41,011 --> 01:32:43,680
to science and they're
finding that they have,

1481
01:32:43,710 --> 01:32:48,030
this guys have died in their forties
that the whatever the fuck they have on

1482
01:32:48,031 --> 01:32:50,280
their brain,
they don't see in the average.

1483
01:32:50,820 --> 01:32:55,380
They see it basically with people who
die of all simers in their eighties okay.

1484
01:32:56,670 --> 01:33:01,110
People get paralyzed playing our game.
All right. If you don't like our game,

1485
01:33:01,230 --> 01:33:05,940
you know what it is the rest of the world,
you know I, this is what I think it is.

1486
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:09,180
I just want to thank you big
fucking problem with America is,

1487
01:33:09,420 --> 01:33:13,080
is that you just like a lot of our shit.
You like our music.

1488
01:33:13,170 --> 01:33:14,490
You like our clothes,

1489
01:33:14,700 --> 01:33:19,620
you like a lot of our culture and it
kills you that we don't pay attention to

1490
01:33:19,621 --> 01:33:23,820
your shit. You want our fucking
approval on some goddamn level.

1491
01:33:23,821 --> 01:33:28,590
Don't roll your fucking eyes at me.
You do the fuck.

1492
01:33:28,591 --> 01:33:33,420
Are you doing listening to this podcast?
This is an American podcast, sir.

1493
01:33:34,990 --> 01:33:35,823
Yeah.

1494
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:38,120
What is your fucking,
other than our foreign policy,

1495
01:33:38,121 --> 01:33:41,480
which I totally fucking
understand. What is it? You know,

1496
01:33:41,481 --> 01:33:43,310
because all the shit I
just said about soccer,

1497
01:33:43,311 --> 01:33:45,320
I actually really enjoy
the premiere league.

1498
01:33:45,530 --> 01:33:49,160
I really enjoy that and I just think it's
cool that you had to go there and you

1499
01:33:49,161 --> 01:33:52,460
sing songs and you drink fucking
beer with your red fet faces.

1500
01:33:52,461 --> 01:33:53,630
I think that's a good thing.

1501
01:33:54,660 --> 01:33:55,493
You know,

1502
01:33:57,460 --> 01:33:59,440
I actually,
I respect the fucking game here.

1503
01:33:59,441 --> 01:34:01,970
You come over here
talking about fucking a,

1504
01:34:03,460 --> 01:34:05,860
how the fuck is American football?
Overrated.

1505
01:34:07,530 --> 01:34:09,600
You never even said why it was overrated.

1506
01:34:11,270 --> 01:34:15,710
It is American footballs.
Yup. Yeah, but United States
is in the Americas. You dumb.

1507
01:34:15,711 --> 01:34:19,670
Fuck. What are we supposed to call
it? Asian football. You know what?

1508
01:34:19,671 --> 01:34:22,550
You're a God damn. Dummy
aren't. Yeah, I on the Dole.

1509
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:24,860
Is that what you guys
call welfare over there?

1510
01:34:26,990 --> 01:34:27,080
Uh,

1511
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:30,290
what is it? Mexicans don't
play. Brazilians don't play
it. Our teachers don't. Yeah,

1512
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:34,460
they don't. They don't. What? Because
they don't play it. We shouldn't play it.

1513
01:34:34,730 --> 01:34:38,870
And it shouldn't be called American
football. Even though we're in America.

1514
01:34:41,150 --> 01:34:45,620
Explain yourself, sir. Uh, I'm
tired of that whole fucking thing.

1515
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:49,130
Oh. Then he goes, well, let
me digress. It's a great game.

1516
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:54,050
If you love commercial breaks.
MMM.

1517
01:34:56,610 --> 01:34:58,060
Well what your fucking game.
Your

1518
01:34:58,060 --> 01:34:59,710
game needs a commercial break.
You know what?

1519
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:01,840
Do you know what fucking soccer needs?
Needs a Goddamn,

1520
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:06,460
it needs like a halftime show
that's being played the entire time.

1521
01:35:07,060 --> 01:35:08,020
If you get bored

1522
01:35:12,550 --> 01:35:13,383
one nil,

1523
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:17,380
we're into the penalty time
and everybody's sitting
there whistling in the crowd.

1524
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:20,730
You did something bad
here. You got to, yeah.

1525
01:35:20,780 --> 01:35:24,770
Yellow card. Ooh, he
took out the red card.

1526
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:30,340
Oh Jesus. A bunch of guys running around
in shorts. Um, anyways, advice. Hey,

1527
01:35:30,341 --> 01:35:35,290
bill loved the podcast. Most guys
would probably write in, uh, and how,

1528
01:35:35,291 --> 01:35:37,930
and ask how to get their
girlfriend to do anal. Well,

1529
01:35:37,931 --> 01:35:41,710
I've got a question that's
a little more practical. Um,

1530
01:35:42,550 --> 01:35:46,360
or girl that I'm seeing
absolutely loves anal. Oh, Jesus.

1531
01:35:47,500 --> 01:35:50,980
Yeah. That, you know something.
That's disgusting. All right.

1532
01:35:51,010 --> 01:35:54,220
I'm just going to say that right off
the bat that it's just fucking gross.

1533
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:59,280
That's something that for some reason
became a big thing in porn for a while.

1534
01:35:59,470 --> 01:36:03,750
And uh, you know, all
I'm going to say is this,

1535
01:36:03,850 --> 01:36:07,800
I try to keep it clean. Here. You
participate in that act long enough,

1536
01:36:07,830 --> 01:36:11,760
you're going to realize why at some
point someday one time you're going to

1537
01:36:11,761 --> 01:36:16,020
realize why you should never stick pp in
there. All right. Without getting gross.

1538
01:36:16,021 --> 01:36:19,080
Okay.
She insist on it every time we have sex.

1539
01:36:19,660 --> 01:36:21,510
Yeah.

1540
01:36:21,540 --> 01:36:26,310
The other day after we got back from a
road trip that involved way too much gas

1541
01:36:26,311 --> 01:36:30,000
station food up. Here we go. Here we go.

1542
01:36:30,030 --> 01:36:33,390
She was having an abnormal amount of gas.

1543
01:36:35,930 --> 01:36:36,061
All right,

1544
01:36:36,061 --> 01:36:39,240
I'm going to pause here and give you
guys a chance to just kind of walk away

1545
01:36:39,241 --> 01:36:42,930
from your little recording devices so
you don't have to listen to the rest of

1546
01:36:42,931 --> 01:36:45,720
this. Here we go. Well, she
eventually got up off the couch,

1547
01:36:45,721 --> 01:36:49,620
ran to the bathroom and yelled.
I just shit my pants.

1548
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:53,990
She was really cool about
it. Oh Jesus. I mean, I mean,

1549
01:36:53,991 --> 01:36:55,940
how cool can you be about it
other than just being honest,

1550
01:36:57,490 --> 01:37:02,490
but she's concerned about the effects of
constantly having things shoved up her

1551
01:37:02,561 --> 01:37:05,870
ass. Yeah. Well she should be.

1552
01:37:06,530 --> 01:37:11,030
She just turned 30 and has only started
doing anal on a consistent spaces for

1553
01:37:11,031 --> 01:37:12,290
the last few years.

1554
01:37:16,250 --> 01:37:18,290
Uh,
I was wondering if you could,

1555
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:23,570
oh, well why are you
bringing my girl into this?

1556
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:26,600
Get her to invite some of her
friends over it and then rambly.

1557
01:37:26,660 --> 01:37:28,040
Randomly asked her friends,

1558
01:37:28,041 --> 01:37:32,270
which ones do anal on a consistent basis
and whether or not they have problems

1559
01:37:32,271 --> 01:37:35,330
shitting themselves.
Thanks for the help.

1560
01:37:37,570 --> 01:37:39,460
Uh, yeah, she didn't, I don't know.

1561
01:37:39,580 --> 01:37:41,680
She didn't shit herself because
of the sex you're having.

1562
01:37:41,681 --> 01:37:46,610
She Shit herself cause you ate
it a gas station, I think. Uh,

1563
01:37:46,611 --> 01:37:50,840
but I can't tell you that. I, I,
you know, yeah, yeah, yeah. I Dunno.

1564
01:37:51,770 --> 01:37:52,603
Okay.

1565
01:37:53,110 --> 01:37:56,790
You know, I dunno by, yes. I
don't know what to tell you.

1566
01:37:58,240 --> 01:38:00,030
I don't know where to go.
I'm not a doctor.

1567
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:05,760
I'm not into doing that to a female and a,
you know,

1568
01:38:05,820 --> 01:38:10,260
let's see. Uh, let's see, uh, very soft
membrane in there. You're dealing with,

1569
01:38:10,290 --> 01:38:14,040
you're dealing with the budget issues
there, buddy barge a fucking issue.

1570
01:38:14,041 --> 01:38:18,700
There's no reason to do it. Um, what
I would tell her is like, yeah, uh,

1571
01:38:18,790 --> 01:38:22,320
that's why you shit yourself so you can
get out of having to do that to her.

1572
01:38:24,180 --> 01:38:28,110
Uh, you don't want to do that to
the person you love though. Yeah.

1573
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:33,060
That's the mother. Your
kids someday, uh, cut.

1574
01:38:34,570 --> 01:38:36,300
Uh,
or you know what we're done with that.

1575
01:38:36,301 --> 01:38:39,090
I think it's about time in this fucking
podcast. Let's go with one more of these.

1576
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:41,040
Hey, hello bill. I'm 18 years old.

1577
01:38:41,041 --> 01:38:44,450
I built with my girlfriend for three
years and honestly I'm tired of fucking

1578
01:38:44,660 --> 01:38:47,700
honor. Uh, the relationship is
fine. Me and her get along great,

1579
01:38:47,701 --> 01:38:50,670
but I feel like the excitement
and the lust is gone.

1580
01:38:50,940 --> 01:38:55,140
This is a becoming a problem is making
it really difficult not to cheat.

1581
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:57,720
I'm guessing at some point
you've had the same problem.

1582
01:38:57,721 --> 01:39:02,721
I just want to know is this going to
happen with every longterm relationship?

1583
01:39:03,060 --> 01:39:07,950
I feel like I'm living the
life of a middle aged, married
man and are uh, already,

1584
01:39:07,951 --> 01:39:11,580
but I don't want it to end it
as me and her get along fine.

1585
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:17,520
Also, I just also just to add,
we've recently tried basically every

1586
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:24,750
sexually and we've everything sexually
and we've easily had sex more than 500

1587
01:39:24,751 --> 01:39:29,010
times, so there's no way to really
spice things up anymore. Thanks.

1588
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:32,513
Uh,

1589
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:34,660
yes, I really think you would
blow up over here in England.

1590
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:38,730
Fewer got your specials on TV over here.
You seem to tap into the British humor.

1591
01:39:38,731 --> 01:39:40,620
The podcast is great, man.
Yeah, Dude. You know what,

1592
01:39:40,621 --> 01:39:42,560
if anybody knows anybody
over there and TV,

1593
01:39:42,570 --> 01:39:44,370
I would love to get my
specials on over there.

1594
01:39:44,670 --> 01:39:48,270
I think I have to do local TV over there.
I should probably try and do that.

1595
01:39:49,350 --> 01:39:52,320
Do a local TV show over there.
That's a great fucking idea. Um,

1596
01:39:52,370 --> 01:39:56,190
what the hell was your question? Um, sir,

1597
01:39:56,220 --> 01:39:59,520
there is no way to spice it up
after you've banged a 500 times.

1598
01:39:59,521 --> 01:40:03,090
You just better hope that you love
her in the end. Sexual happened, uh,

1599
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:06,960
less frequent and uh,
it's just how it is.

1600
01:40:07,820 --> 01:40:09,270
It's just how it is. But then, you know,

1601
01:40:09,271 --> 01:40:11,730
if you really loved this girl
and your dumper, you're gonna,

1602
01:40:11,731 --> 01:40:14,880
you're gonna be sad and be thinking
about her as you're banging this new girl

1603
01:40:14,881 --> 01:40:19,680
who you're going to be excited about
fucking probably about 40 times and then

1604
01:40:19,681 --> 01:40:21,510
you're going to be right
back to it. So, uh,

1605
01:40:21,511 --> 01:40:25,140
that's why they say it's
not the be all end all. Um,

1606
01:40:25,160 --> 01:40:27,240
I don't know what to tell
you. You know, I don't know.

1607
01:40:27,241 --> 01:40:29,910
Why don't you go down the costume
store store and dress up like a fucking

1608
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:34,230
Milkman? Why don't you start with
that? I don't know what to tell you.

1609
01:40:35,220 --> 01:40:38,340
I don't know what to tell you too.
Yeah,

1610
01:40:38,370 --> 01:40:41,580
it's fucking brutal and happens
and happens to everybody. Uh,

1611
01:40:41,581 --> 01:40:45,810
sorry to end on a fucking Downer
there. Ah. Anyways, let's, let's go up.

Everybody's tripping cause

1643
01:42:27,030 --> 01:42:30,790
Another chilling was reported
on the evening news. Somebody,

1644
01:42:31,110 --> 01:42:35,640
his brother got behind a pair of
shoes in the midst of all this shit.

1645
01:42:35,641 --> 01:42:40,590
I think about myself wondered
when somebodies gonna try
to take me off the shelf.

01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:46,290
[inaudible] be another valley casualties.
So when I'm building, I pack my pistol,

1647
01:42:46,291 --> 01:42:51,210
grip aside, money cause on the city's
three Sedalia brother just can't win.

1648
01:42:51,540 --> 01:42:56,540
When the pope you think are your friends
really and your friends and wish we

1649
01:42:56,810 --> 01:43:00,150
can't sleep.
When everybody around me

1650
01:43:00,620 --> 01:43:02,240
keeps falling six feet

1651
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:21,390
pain as deeper side of everybody grows
as they approach to see the body before

1652
01:43:21,391 --> 01:43:22,500
the cats get close,

1653
01:43:23,160 --> 01:43:27,640
the person standing next to me and
snapped the flit wants us in the Catholic,

1654
01:43:28,010 --> 01:43:32,940
closed on, knew that that was sick. The
whole entire family spoke on this defense.

1655
01:43:33,570 --> 01:43:36,300
The Gwalia son yourselves
and make us reminisce.

1656
01:43:37,510 --> 01:43:39,890
You'll run all the song
and I broke down myself.

1657
01:43:40,500 --> 01:43:44,900
We're in a look and seeing the family
that my partner left at the end of why

1658
01:43:45,090 --> 01:43:48,840
your book into its final song,
thank contort myself.

1659
01:43:48,841 --> 01:43:50,250
The worst is yet to come.

1660
01:43:51,450 --> 01:43:56,360
Every one was headed for the final flight
as we creeped along the gravel on the

1661
01:43:56,361 --> 01:43:58,430
burial site.
That got wrecked.

1662
01:43:58,580 --> 01:44:01,620
The said as well as in
that was not a Sam as day.

1663
01:44:01,880 --> 01:44:04,250
Lower my little problem Tosa side,
the ground,

1664
01:44:04,700 --> 01:44:07,260
everybody dropped the
flowers on the coffin.

1665
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:11,960
Tom and then the work Gomo
would that concrete block? Yes.

1666
01:44:12,230 --> 01:44:13,063
Damn.

1667
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:32,560
A lot of mothers can rot.
I watched tears fall down from the eyes.

1668
01:44:33,020 --> 01:44:37,340
Everybody wants to go to heaven,
but nobody wants to take the chains.

1669
01:44:37,580 --> 01:44:39,730
They chose the music so day.
By the day.

1670
01:44:39,731 --> 01:44:44,720
I couldn't tell him nothing was a player
at the avid got caught up in the game.

1671
01:44:44,721 --> 01:44:46,540
Now my boy is sending the casket.

1672
01:44:46,950 --> 01:44:51,890
Everybody's looking for somebody else to
blame or shame that let his mother know

1673
01:44:51,891 --> 01:44:56,600
that he was in a gang. We used to
kick it out in the air that night,

1674
01:44:56,990 --> 01:45:00,050
coming up,
trying to have the finer things in life,

1675
01:45:00,610 --> 01:45:03,930
but now my boys don't.
I wish she was at home.

1676
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:07,280
I wish she wouldn't have
never fell victim to the call,

1677
