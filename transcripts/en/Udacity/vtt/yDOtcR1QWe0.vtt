00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:06.480
The first step in the BGP route selection process is to prefer a route with the

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.060
higher local preference value. The local preference value is simply a numerical

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:18.260
value that a network operator in the local AS can assign to a particular

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.230
route. This attribute is purely local, it

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.130
does not get transmitted between autonomous systems,

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.364
so it is dropped in EBGP route

00:00:27.364 --> 00:00:30.830
advertisements. But it allows a local network operator

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.140
the ability to explicitly state that one

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.790
route should be preferred over the other. Among

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.270
routes with equally high local preference values,

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.020
BGP prefers routes with shorter AS path length.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.260
The idea is that a path might be better if it traverses a fewer number of

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.760
autonomous systems. The third step involves comparison

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.020
of multiple routes advertised from the same

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.120
autonomous system. The multi-exit discriminator value allows

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.150
one AS to specify that one exit

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.170
point in the network is more preferred than another. So lower MED values are

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.580
preferred, but this step only applies to

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.370
compare routes that are advertised from the same

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:21.500
autonomous system. Because the neighboring AS sets the MED value on routes that

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.740
it advertises to a neighbor, MED

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.520
values are not inherently comparable across routes

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.420
advertised from different ASs. Therefore this

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.270
step only applies to routes advertised from

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.760
the same AS. Fourth, BGP speaking routers

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.490
inside an autonomous system will prefer a

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:47.780
BGP route with a shorter IGP path cost to the IGP next up. The idea here is

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.660
that if a router inside an autonomous system

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.870
learns two routes via IBGP then it wants to

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.700
prefer the one that results in the shortest

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.870
path the to the exit of the network. This

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.220
behavior results in what is called hot potato routing,

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.220
where an autonomous system sends traffic to the neigjboring

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.953
autonomous system via a path that traverses as

00:02:09.953 --> 00:02:12.960
little of its own network as possible. Finally, if

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.880
there are multiple routes with the highest possible local

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.620
preference, the shortest AS path and the shortest IGP

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.240
path, the router uses a tiebreak to pick a

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.320
single breaking route. This tiebreaking step is arbitrary. It

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.500
might be the most stable, or the route that's

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.830
been advertised the longest. But often, to induce determinism,

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.820
operators typically prefer that this tie breaking step

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.620
is performed based on the route advertisement from the

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.560
router with the lowest router ID, which is

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.060
typically the neighboring router's IP address. Let's now take

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.070
a closer look into local preference, AS path

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.860
length, muli-exit discriminator and hot potato routing. Now as

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.950
I mentioned the first step in the router

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.240
selection process is for routers to prefer routes with

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.990
higher local preference values. Now an operator can

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.405
actually set the local preference value on incoming

00:03:03.405 --> 00:03:07.140
BGP route advertisements to affect which route a

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.930
router ultimately selects. Let's see how this works.
