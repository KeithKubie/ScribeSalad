00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.559
A true artist will do anything for their craft
and for actors in Hollywood that sometimes

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:14.030
means putting their bodies through some pretty
intense stuff.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.500
Whether they are beefing up to play superheroes
or shedding pounds to portray junkies, some

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.670
of your favorite actors have a serious history
of transforming their bodies.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.369
For this video we are taking a look at some
of the best in our list of 10 Popular Actors

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.390

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.579
Chris Pratt – Guardians Of The Galaxy
Remember the days of chubby Chris Pratt making

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.710
us laugh on Parks and Recreation?

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.110
If you don’t, pause this video and go watch
all sevens seasons immediately!

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.039
After Chris Pratt was cast to play Star lord
in Guardians Of The Galaxy, he took it upon

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.340
himself to get into great shape, and did he
ever!

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.140
The actor lost 60 pounds and transformed himself
from the funny fat guy to the jacked leading

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.780
man that he is today.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.000
Since his transformation, Pratt has been landing
leading roles left, right and center with

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.840
great performances in movies like Passengers,
The Magnificent Seven and Jurassic World.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.670
The craziest part about his weight loss story
is that Guardians Of The Galaxy director James

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.790
Gunn didn’t even ask him to lose weight
for the part.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.220
With all the success and health the change
has brought him, we are guessing Pratt is

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.750
happy with his decision!

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.500
Anne Hathaway – Les Miserables
For years, Anne Hathaway was always considered

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.760
to be a pretty girl who makes for a fun and
non-threatening lead in a romantic comedy.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.170
Then, in 2012, Hathaway flipped the script
and delivered a bone chilling performance

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.409
in Les Miserables.

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.290
Although she only mustered about 20 minutes
of screen time, she was able to take home

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.579
the honors for Best Supporting Actress at
The Academy Awards.

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.799
This was surely due to her fantastic acting,
singing and crazy physical transformation.

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.820
Hathaway went from the girl next door to the
troll under the bridge by losing 25 pounds,

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.009
having her hair cut short and putting in disgusting
fake teeth.

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:09.330
By the time she dies in the movie, she is
almost completely unrecognizable.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.300
Christian Bale – The Machinist
Christian Bale is one of the most talented,

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.300
respected and honestly feared actors working
today.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.010
He’s made headlines for outstanding performances
and outlandish on set outbreaks but there

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.800
is no denying that he fully commits himself
in to every role he does.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.510
Bale is no stranger to changing his body for
his movies as he put on a insane amount of

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.250
muscle to play The Dark Knight and turned
himself into a pudgy slob for American Hustle.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.840
His craziest transformation, however, came
when he was preparing for his role in The

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.840
Machinist when he dropped a terrifying 63
pounds.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.150
He did his with an dangerously low calorie
intake and he apparently wanted to lose even

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.900
more weight but doctors had to say no.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.629
The skeleton-like photos of Bale are now iconic
and are just another reason why he is such

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:56.340
an amazing talent.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.450
Charlize Theron – Monster
Charlize Theron is the type of beautiful where

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.030
she can walk into a room in a ball gown and
time seems to stop.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.250
The actress has been glowing on the big screen
for years now and even in her gritty one-armed

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.230
performance as Furiosa in Mad Max, she still
has that beautiful look.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.450
That is why her transformation for the movie
Monster is so impressive as she was able to

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.129
become seriously unattractive.

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:24.560
For the film Theron gained a whopping 30 pounds,
shaved off her eyebrows and added in some

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.190
gross fake teeth.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.230
All of this work makes the actress pretty
scary looking and definitely helped her secure

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.379
her Oscar for Best Actress.

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:35.840
Mila Kunis and Natalie Portman – Black Swan
Black Swan is truly exciting psychological

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.840
thriller that, through ballet, gives the audience
a window into the world of obsession and psychological

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.840
breakdowns.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.150
Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis are great in
the film, but they have been very vocal about

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.060
how difficult their roles really were.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.860
No, we’re not talking about the sex scene
between the two of them (again), we’re talking

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.031
about the fact that they each lost 20 pounds
and were forced to train for 6 hours a day,

00:03:50.031 --> 00:03:51.830
7 days a week.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.580
Both of these women are slim to begin with,
so shedding off another 20 pounds must have

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.019
been a serious chore and both Kunis and Portman
have spoken about the pain they were in from

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:02.970
all the starving.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.690
Jared Leto – Chapter 27, Dallas Buyers Club
When you decide to take on the role of The

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.310
Joker, you have to know that you will become
of the most talked about actors in all of

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.470
Hollywood, and that is exactly what happened
with Jared Leto.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.479
But the truth is, Leto had a long list of
great and even academy awarding winning roles

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.519
long before Suicide Squad.

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.950
Leto is definitely not afraid to throw all
of himself into a part and he made that clear

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.520
when he became almost unrecognizable after
gaining a whopping 67 pounds for his leading

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.840
role in Chapter 27.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.610
Then, after he got back to his normal weight,
he proceeded to lose an additional 40 pounds

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.840
for his role in Dallas Buyers Club, the part
that would land him the Oscar for Best Supporting

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:41.840
Actor.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.450
Say what you will about his performance as
the clown prince of Gotham, but nobody can

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.620
deny that Leto can transform his body for
his artform!

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.560
Adam Driver – Silence
Adam Driver is probably best known as Kylo

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.470
Ren, the big bad in Star Wars The Force Awakens
and likely the next episodes as well.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.540
Driver is an interesting guy as his career
features a wide range of roles from raunchy

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.380
comedies to heavy dramas and everything in
between.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.539
The world will really get a look at Driver’s
acting chops when they get to see Martin Scorsese’s

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:11.090
new film, Silence.

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.630
In the film, Driver plays a Jesuit priest
and from the trailers and clips that have

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.600
come out, it is clear that he lost an enormous
amount of weight for the part.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.290
Driver looks skeletal and he has told the
press that not only were he and his costar

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:24.090
Andrew Garfield asked to lose weight for the
start of filming, but they were required to

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.080
continue to lose weight throughout the filming
process as well.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.570
This definitely sounds like a lot of work
but when you are an up and coming actor and

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:35.210
you land a leading role in a Scorsese film,
you do what you got to do.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:40.729
Jason Segal – The Five-Year Engagement
Jason Segal is on hilarious dude and his performance

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:44.550
as Marshall Eriksson on How I Met Your Mother
is one for the ages.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.950
Segal has never really been known as a particularly
fat or skinny or jacked guy so it is somewhat

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.800
surprising to hear about his body transformation.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.970
Apparently, when preparing to film The Five
Year Engagement Jason Segal actually dropped

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:01.590
35 pounds as he felt that it would make him
a more believable match for the stunning Emily

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:02.590
Blunt.

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.070
This is a somewhat shocking number, but we
have to give it to the actor for trying to

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.900
bring authenticity to the role, even if the
movie probably didn’t deserve it.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.350
Jonah Hill – 21 Jump Street
Could you imagine losing 40 pounds and then

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.240
still having to play “The Fat Guy”?

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.009
Well, that is exactly what happened to Jonah
Hill in 21 Jump Street.

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:24.910
The actor is known to fluctuate in weight
just about as much as he fluctuates between

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:29.669
Oscar movies and stoner comedies, but for
his role opposite Channing Tatum in 21 Jump

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:32.000
Street he really shed some pounds.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Hill is never going to be the ripped leading
man, especially standing next to the specimen

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.240
that is Tatum, but it was cool to see him
as a more lean and mobile character.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.270
The movie is a really great action/comedy
and Hill’s weight loss allowed him to be

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.680
more believable both as a cop and as a high
school student.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.800
The next Jump Street movie is currently in
the works and will reportedly be a cross over

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.540
with the Men In Black franchise.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:59.270
Margot Robbie – Tonya Harding
Lately, Margot Robbie’s name, face and body

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:04.000
have been popping up all over the place and
with the fantastic job that she did in 2016’s

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.300
Suicide Squad, we can understand why.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.430
While her Harley Quinn costume may have sparked
some serious controversy, there is no denying

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.900
that the Australian actress looked smoking
hot in that outfit.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.590
Well, fans of Robbie and stunning looks may
be shocked to see what she is looking like

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:18.590
these days.

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:22.530
The actress is currently filming her role
as infamous figure skater Tonya Harding and

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:26.520
a photo that surfaced online has Robbie looking
disheveled and pudgy.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.540
It sounds like she is just wearing a fat suit
and some prosthetics but it really is shocking

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.680
to see such a bombshell looking that bad.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.960
We are guessing that this look was just for
a particular part of the movie and that Robbie

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.020
will be looking great in those skating outfits
for most of the film!

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:44.289
So there is our list of 10 popular actors
who made insane transformations for their

00:07:44.289 --> 00:07:45.360
movie roles.
