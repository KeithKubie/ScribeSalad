We have this incredible group of
undergraduates, graduate students, and

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:26.230
medical students and doctors who
come here every week and provide direct

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.240
medical services to people who really
need them. Something that we do that is

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.160
really special is we provide them a
non-judgmental environment where we just

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.360
sit and are with them and I've had
clients come to me consistently saying

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.140
if people had treated them the way that
we do, they would have seen a doctor a

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.430
long time ago. I'm proud of the mobile
clinic project because it is completely

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.260
student-run so all the people that you
see here are students themselves from

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.410
three different schools.
We're from the Medical School, from the

00:00:53.410 --> 00:01:00.310
public health school and undergraduate
school. So we're packaging vitamins for clients, and we pack a weeks supply so that way when clients

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.940
come they have enough to last them until
the next clinic. There's some clients

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.200
that I've got to know over my time here
and I love seeing them and having them

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.539
recognize me and we share a moment.
They're not prejudging anybody which is

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:21.100
great. They realize they have to deal with people that are at risk

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.180
and they treat them very good. I feel
like it makes medical school actually

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.850
seem kind of real because the past four
weeks you've been studying, going to

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.200
lecture, and those are things
that are really important to medicine,

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.860
but being able to use those two skills
and to give back is something that's

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.530
invaluable and really reminds
me why I decided to go into

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.430
medicine in the first place.
