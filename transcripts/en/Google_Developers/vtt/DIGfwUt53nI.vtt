[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.920
MAGGIE STANPHILL: Good
morning, everyone.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.808
Welcome to the last
day of I/O. Yeah.

00:00:13.808 --> 00:00:16.560
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.330
We're really excited
to be here today,

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.640
because this is the
first time UX writing

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.586
has been on stage at I/O,
so thank you so much.

00:00:24.586 --> 00:00:28.780
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.490
I'm Maggie Stanphill, and I
manage a team of UX writers

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.120
at Google, and we work
on travel, shopping,

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.920
and payments products.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.270
And I'm joined here today by
members of my team, Allison

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.670
Rung and Juliana Appenrodt.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.030
And today, you're probably here
for the same reason we are.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.361
We're passionate about building
products that people love,

00:00:51.361 --> 00:00:53.360
and we're here to share
an insight with you that

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.630
will keep users coming
back again and again.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.380
It's choosing the right
words, because we all

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.510
know what can happen when
you choose the wrong words.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.650
Take, for example, the first
time you use a social app.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.980
Can you imagine if
it said, "No friends.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.750
How sad?"

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.980
It'd be a pretty bad
start to a new friendship.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.790
So what we're here to
share with you today

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.700
are insights to make sure you
can apply content strategy

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.110
to your product.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.470
So over the next
35 minutes, I'll

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.590
share an overview of
content strategy of Google,

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.430
Allison will share three
UX writing best practices,

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.100
and Juliana will
share a case study

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.780
about how we defined brand
voice for Android Pay.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.200
So let's get started
with how we approach

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.600
content strategy at Google.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.860
Many of you know that we follow
principle, focus on the user,

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.330
and all else will follow.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.000
But what you might
not realize is

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.680
that for us, focusing on a
user starts with the content.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.669
The content is the text, the
reviews data, the imagery.

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:10.729
This is content strategy--

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.180
the holistic development
and crafting of content

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.340
in the product experience.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.120
And UX writing is a specialty
within this discipline

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.030
that focuses on
helping users achieve

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.730
their goals with language.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.970
And in my five years
here at Google,

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.920
I've had the great
opportunity to work

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.020
on a number of
products, and I wanted

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.910
to share a few
scenarios with you,

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.470
so you can get an understanding
of how we approach our craft.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.800
So for this example, let's
say a user is searching

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.060
for an Italian wine
store in San Francisco,

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.260
and they're looking for
the closest one to them.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.450
The label, Sort
by Distance, helps

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.880
them find the right location.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.520
This has been the product
of a ton of research

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.320
and a lot of
iterations to ensure

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.960
we're surfacing the right
information at the right time.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.070
Another example is when
we're helping a user write

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.620
a review on Google Maps.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.870
We offer information,
such as the fact that this

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.860
will be posted publicly,
to engender trust,

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.810
and we offer a helpful prompt--

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.570
"Tell others why you
like this place."

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.480
So hopefully, it's a quick
way to get them started.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.910
Just curious, how many
of you have written

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.740
a review on Google Maps?

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.490
Show of hands.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:31.290
Awesome.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.807
Thank you, guys, so much for
contributing to the community.

00:03:35.807 --> 00:03:37.265
All right, and this
time, I'm going

00:03:37.265 --> 00:03:39.080
to take you into the
kitchen for some hands

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.530
free help, and with
using only their voice,

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.080
a user can get directions for
their recipe on Google Home.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.990
So what all three of these
have in common is language.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.880
Language is helping the user
get where they want to go,

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.420
and by focusing on what
the user wants to achieve,

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.740
this builds trust and loyalty.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.370
This is what content
strategy is all about.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.790
So at Google, I wanted to
share a little bit about how

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.620
we structure our team.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.110
We've made a big investment
in content strategy

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.990
as part of our user
experience discipline.

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:21.209
Content strategy is part of
an overarching group that

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.490
focuses on the user
experience and focuses

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.310
on building holistic
product solutions,

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.980
partnering with a
cross-disciplinary team

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.460
of writers, researchers,
and designers.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.530
Writers work with
designers to think

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.990
about information
hierarchy on the page

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.270
and to guide user actions.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.830
Writers work with researchers to
test hypotheses about language

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.460
and inform our insights
with their great research

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.290
capabilities.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.050
We found that this
holistic approach

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.090
to solving these complex
user product problems really

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.620
helps us create better
user experiences.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.510
But what might not
be quite as evident

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.610
is the impact that
this focus on language

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.867
can have on the business.

00:05:07.867 --> 00:05:09.450
So I want to share
with you an example

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.470
from Hotel Search on Google.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.680
This is a great example, where
literally changing two words

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.650
had a significant
impact on the business.

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.800
We used to have a label
which read, Book a Room,

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.190
and what we found was this was
far too committal at that stage

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.200
in the decision-making process.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.190
So we switched it to,
Check Availability,

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.830
and what we found was this
was meeting the user where

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.690
they were at in their mindset.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.679
They were still
considering rooms,

00:05:38.679 --> 00:05:41.220
and they wanted to understand
what dates were available, what

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.490
prices were in that date range.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.610
And so with those two
words, Check Availability,

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.870
we saw a 17% increase
in engagement.

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.300
That's a significant
impact on the business.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.000
Sometimes the other end of the
spectrum is harder to measure,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.460
but equally important--

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.170
that emotional connection that
users have with a product.

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:13.790
Sometimes we call this emotional
connection brand voice,

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.560
and I want to share a
little bit about how

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.470
you might approach defining
brand voice for your app

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.480
or product.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.360
So first, start
with the benefits.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.680
Really consider how to
enunciate the most standout

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.656
traits of your product,
and then consider

00:06:30.656 --> 00:06:32.030
how your product's
differentiated

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.320
from its competitors.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.520
When I had the opportunity to
work on the Google brand voice,

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.640
we took our lead from
the Google search page.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:45.920
Its simplicity and ease
of use was a cue for us

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:51.250
to inform our brand voice
tenet around usefulness.

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:55.300
We also took our lead from
the delightful Google Doodle,

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.980
and we have a tenet,
which is around optimism.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:04.180
And you'll hear more of
this throughout the day.

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.400
So basically, we have
this brand foundation

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.310
with our brand
voice, and it applies

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.170
to our suite of products.

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.330
And I'll share with
you a recent example

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.210
that I had the opportunity to
work on with my team, which

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.250
is the Google Trips app.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.990
And if you guys
haven't checked it out,

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:21.910
I highly recommend that you do.

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:24.160
It's a fun app in
that it helps you

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.530
organize all of your
travel information,

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.150
so it's available offline.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.460
So you can download
reservations,

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.920
and if you arrive
somewhere without data,

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.870
you can still access it.

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.150
So when we were thinking
about the benefit,

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.210
we landed on a line,
which reads, "No internet.

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:41.920
No problem."

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.830
Paired with a
delightful illustration,

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:48.632
we think this really tells
the story of both the benefits

00:07:48.632 --> 00:07:49.840
and the excitement of travel.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.490
So through our experience
here at Google,

00:07:55.490 --> 00:08:00.550
we found that when you have
the foundation of UX writing,

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:04.060
and you add brand voice, we
know if some of the parts

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:08.060
come together, something
really amazing can happen.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:09.760
We believe that UX
writing can certainly

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.670
survive with the
fundamentals, but it

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:15.340
can thrive with brand voice.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:16.840
With that, I'm going
to hand it over

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.260
to Allison, who will talk
about our three UX writing

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.016
best practices.

00:08:23.016 --> 00:08:26.848
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:29.350
ALLISON RUNG: Thanks, Maggie.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:31.630
My name's Allison
rung, and I'm a writer

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:35.679
on the Trust and Privacy team.

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:39.940
Part of my job is to explain
why you see ads on Google

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.850
and to show how you can control
those ads to make them better

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:44.920
for you.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.110
Like any other
writer at Google, I

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:48.790
learn a lot of
technical language

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:50.620
before translating
it into something

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.920
that anybody can understand.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.110
The technical language
that I start with

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:59.870
tends to do with
advertising and ad networks,

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:04.780
but this challenge is common
for any product writing.

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:07.330
How do you translate what's
happening on your back end

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:10.690
to the other side of the screen?

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:12.730
How do you make your
software sound human?

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.540
This work is pretty
intuitive for writers.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:21.780
We think about the technical
context we learned about,

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.700
and then we think
about the person who's

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.080
using the app or the product.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.770
And then we decide
what sounds right.

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:30.180
We tend to say
what we're writing

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:35.340
out loud to make sure that each
word has the right ring to it.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.800
But I know many of you don't
have writers on your product

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.790
teams yet, so today I'm going
to try to reverse engineer

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:44.220
this natural writing
process and guide you

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:48.510
through three of the
principles that guide it.

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:51.590
These are principles that
we've kind of internalized,

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:56.400
and they are clear,
concise, and useful.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.420
I'll start with clear.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:03.870
So let's say that somebody is
trying to sign in to your app,

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:07.340
and then they mess up their
password for whatever reason.

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:10.850
And then they see this--

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:12.530
"Error-- Failure.

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:15.710
An authentication
error has occurred."

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:19.145
This sounds terrible, right?

00:10:19.145 --> 00:10:19.645
Right.

00:10:19.645 --> 00:10:22.460
It reminds me of
those restart messages

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:26.065
we got on our first computers in
like the late '80s, early '90s.

00:10:26.065 --> 00:10:26.690
Remember those?

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:29.640
There was a bomb that
was about to explode.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.270
It said something
about system error.

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:35.520
What was going on there
and what's happening here

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.870
is a disaster in software
terms, because the function

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:40.580
can't be completed.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.710
But for people,
it's not a big deal,

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:46.430
and we can tone down
this language a little.

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:49.640
So in other words,
failure and authentication

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.954
are software problems,
not human problems.

00:10:52.954 --> 00:10:55.370
And we can improve them by
switching them out to something

00:10:55.370 --> 00:11:00.170
that people can relate
to like signing in.

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:04.280
"Sign-in error-- a sign-in
error has occurred."

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:09.610
This is better, and notice here
how a single term, sign-in, has

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:12.230
replaced two different
technical terms, failure

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:14.000
and authentication.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.990
So that should tell you that
clear doesn't mean precise.

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:20.360
It means just enough
context to make sense

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.180
to your typical user.

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.730
And I know a lot of you
work on enterprise apps,

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:28.090
or you're writing
for specialists.

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:29.750
Specialist language
is totally OK

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:31.370
when you have a
specialist audience.

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:35.760
You just have to keep
your own audience in mind.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.990
All right, so another way you
can make your writing clearer

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:43.750
is to pay attention to verbs.

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:45.760
A verb is an action word.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:49.340
It tends to be the most
powerful part of your sentence,

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:52.420
and ideally, it will relate
some action to the user.

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:59.190
Here our verb is, has
occurred, and it's a weak verb,

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:03.100
because it's describing a state
of being within the software.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:05.380
So to make it better,
we'll just switch it

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:09.820
for what the user is
doing, the user's action.

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.056
"You entered an
incorrect password."

00:12:12.056 --> 00:12:12.930
Pretty simple, right?

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:18.670
OK, so this is clarity.

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:21.160
With clarity, we
remove technical terms,

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.530
and we put the action in
the context of the user.

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:25.930
This is an especially
good lesson

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:28.510
to remember when you're writing
your product announcements

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:30.760
or your app updates.

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.670
Instead of focusing on the
technical specs of whatever

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:37.200
new feature you're releasing,
try to focus on the new action

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.200
that people can perform.

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:42.980
The second principle is concise.

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.370
Concise doesn't only mean short.

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:52.490
It means something
closer to economical,

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:54.770
so when we're writing
with concision,

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:56.480
we look at our
message, and we make

00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:00.050
sure that every word on the
screen has a distinct job.

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:06.490
Here, the header doesn't
have a distinct job.

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:07.780
We don't need it.

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:10.210
The body is working
fine without it,

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:14.470
and this is a very common
problem in product writing.

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:19.240
We have a ton of superfluous
headers or subtexts or sidebars

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:22.650
or descriptions, because their
design shows some preexisting

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:26.969
text field, and then you
feel compelled to fill it in.

00:13:26.969 --> 00:13:28.510
But you should really
avoid that when

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:33.820
you can, and instead,
practice content first design.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.890
Content first design
will make sure

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:38.530
that your visuals are
working in service

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:42.620
of what you're trying to say
and not the other way around.

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:45.430
So try not to jam your
messages into boxes

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:47.060
that weren't meant for them.

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:49.450
And ideally, try
to have designers

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:51.180
work in parallel with writers.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.640
OK, so now we've gotten
rid of our header,

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.910
and I've been adamant about
removing extra text here,

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:03.400
because as you all
know from experience,

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.940
we don't read every
word on screens, do we?

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:09.400
We scan.

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:13.660
So this is a mocked up heat map
from an iTracking study showing

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:17.170
where people's
focal points land.

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:20.200
We know that people's eyes
follow an F shaped pattern

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.630
as they read screens.

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:25.540
They read the first line,
maybe the second line,

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:27.640
but then they start
skipping down the page,

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:32.550
catching only the first or
second word of each sentence.

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:36.570
So for this reason, we keep our
text not only concise, but also

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:37.400
frontloaded.

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:43.870
Frontloading means to put
your important concepts first,

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:46.570
so people's eyes catch
those important words

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:47.620
as they skip down.

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:54.510
Here, we're in trouble, because
the most important concept,

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:58.240
the incorrect password,
is all the way at the end.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:01.560
And we can fix it by
flipping this around--

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:03.010
wrong password.

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:04.842
So now that we've done
this, it turns out

00:15:04.842 --> 00:15:06.300
we don't need
anything else, right?

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:06.870
This is fine.

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:08.578
These two words are
working on their own.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:14.390
You won't always be able to
reduce your text to just two

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:17.246
words, but this principle
will always hold true,

00:15:17.246 --> 00:15:18.620
and you can use
it anywhere where

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:20.480
you're writing for screens.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.150
Keep the most important
text up front,

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:28.590
and then ruthlessly edit
whatever comes after it.

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:29.090
All right.

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:32.030
Now we're onto our
final principle, useful.

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:33.610
You want your text
to help people

00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:36.932
to get where they want to go.

00:15:36.932 --> 00:15:39.140
And now we'll talk about
the only part of the message

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:41.030
we haven't looked at yet--

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:44.390
the call to action, or CTA.

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:46.790
Calls to action-- they
tend to be button text,

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:49.700
or they're hyperlinked,
and they guide people

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.780
to their next step.

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:53.870
So for that reason,
they need to resonate

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:55.100
with what they want to do.

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:02.370
Here, OK is not a good
CTA, because people

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:06.380
aren't generally happy or
OK with the wrong password.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.970
No, they want to
try again, right?

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:13.374
So Try Again is a
perfectly good edit.

00:16:13.374 --> 00:16:14.790
But if everyone
here, if you think

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:17.730
for a minute about all the
hundreds or thousands of times

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:19.190
you've messed up your password--

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:22.050
I know for me, it's usually
on airline websites--

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:25.840
you'll realize this
isn't all we need, right?

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:26.340
Right.

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:26.580
Good.

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:28.170
Yeah, it's early
here in California,

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:29.650
but I see people nodding.

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:33.389
Yeah, we need to offer
password recovery, too.

00:16:33.389 --> 00:16:35.430
If you forget your password,
and your only option

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:39.050
is to try again,
you'll only be annoyed.

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:40.140
OK.

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:42.690
So I know you guys
are all pros, and I

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:45.960
know that you have this basic
sign-in behavior covered.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:48.130
It's a very common pattern.

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:49.680
But what I want
you your take away

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:53.100
is that paying attention
to writing and the people

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:57.000
you're writing for can uncover
some of the basic functions

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.340
your app needs to offer.

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:03.630
So if you don't think of those
edge cases and write to them,

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:07.720
then you might see some
drop-off in your usage.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:12.880
OK, wrapping up, clear,
concise, and useful--

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.940
if you pay attention to
these three principles,

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:17.640
you'll connect better
with your users.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:21.160
But you may have realized as I
walked you through this editing

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:26.660
exercise that good UX
writing is not a science.

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:29.450
There's no correct answer.

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:32.730
These three principles
aren't in perfect harmony.

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:34.534
There is a kind of
tension in between them.

00:17:34.534 --> 00:17:35.950
They're competing
with each other.

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:43.090
When we made our text clear,
it was still pretty long.

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:45.700
It wasn't very scannable.

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:49.410
Then when we made the text
concise, it got shorter,

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:53.110
but that was at the
expense of some clarity.

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:56.080
And then finally, when
we made the text useful,

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:56.890
it stretched out.

00:17:56.890 --> 00:17:57.880
It got longer again.

00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:59.140
It became less scannable.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:03.910
So you can find
the right balance

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:05.800
between these principles.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.170
When you think about
your user's context,

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:11.590
think about what she
wants to do in the moment.

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:14.125
And you can also look toward
your product's brand voice.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.070
Your brand voice
should guide you

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:23.630
to the right balance between
clear, concise, and useful

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:28.140
in a way that's true to
your product's character.

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:31.700
And you can begin to find the
elements of that character

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.950
by thinking about the
core function of what

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:36.050
your product does,
and then think

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:38.480
about what makes it special,
how it's differentiated.

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:45.000
As Maggie mentioned,
Google's brand voice

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.840
is designed in part
after our search page.

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.480
Search is an
everyday tool, so we

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.740
like to use everyday,
friendly language.

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.510
And search is also
pretty clever,

00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:59.340
so we use clever
language sometimes,

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:01.140
but we're not too
clever, because we want

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:04.740
to be accessible to anyone.

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:06.930
Our language also
reflects the optimism

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:09.180
of search that you can
see here in the I'm

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:12.270
Feeling Lucky button or
those Doodle illustrations

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:13.751
that Maggie mentioned.

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.280
I like to talk through
Google's brand voice

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:22.440
with this old slogan
from Google Earth.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.930
Hello, Earth.

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:25.940
This is so simple, right?

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:28.520
This is positive
and forward-looking,

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:33.920
and it's inclusive to the point
of welcoming the entire globe.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.750
There's also a
slight play on words

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:38.780
here, where Earth refers
both to the product

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:40.230
name and the planet.

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:48.490
And we all know
this Android slogan.

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:51.400
This sounds Googly, right?

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:54.580
Be together, not the same.

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:57.890
Many of us love this,
but why do we love it?

00:19:57.890 --> 00:19:59.410
Why does it sound so Googly?

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:01.660
How is it working?

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:04.900
Well, first of all, there
is this overarching theme

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:09.130
of inclusion that we saw
on the Hello Earth slogan.

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:11.480
And there's also a
play on words here,

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:15.310
which reflects the
optimism of our brand.

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:17.920
Be together, not the same.

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.660
As we read this, there's
kind of cognitive surprise.

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:25.900
We read, "Be together, not,"
and we expect something

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:28.570
like the opposite
of together, apart.

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:32.980
Be together, not apart, right?

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:37.120
But Google replaces,
apart, with, the same.

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.670
So now we get across the
concept of difference

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:43.750
and even celebrate it
without any negativity.

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:45.380
Be together, not the same.

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:47.230
So again, we're a
very positive brand.

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:52.350
Coming back to
this drab password

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:56.580
message, wrong password,
this is great UX writing.

00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:57.240
It's clear.

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:57.960
It's concise.

00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:58.800
It's useful.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.510
It would work for any product.

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:04.140
But if this came across the
desk of any of my writing

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:08.520
colleagues, I think they would
update it to be more on brand,

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.460
and they'd probably change
it to something like,

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:14.020
"That password
doesn't look right."

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.237
And they would do that,
because since optimism

00:21:16.237 --> 00:21:17.820
is so important to
our brand, we don't

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:21.870
like to lead with negative
words like, wrong.

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:25.290
We're also OK with making
the text a little longer,

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:29.610
a little less concise in order
to be friendly and chatty.

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:32.800
That password
doesn't look right.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:37.860
So now this sounds like Google,
and it's right for Google.

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:41.140
But that doesn't mean
it's right for your brand.

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:45.000
So it's up to you to figure
out what the right sound is

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.320
for your own brand voice.

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:48.960
So to help you with
that, you'll hear

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.120
from Juliana, who will
talk about building

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.175
brand voice for a new product.

00:21:53.175 --> 00:21:57.135
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:02.780
JULIANA APPENRODT:
Thanks, Allison.

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:07.160
Hi, I'm Juliana Appenrodt, and
I'm a UX writer on the Payments

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.780
team.

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:13.220
One of the apps I work
on is Android Pay.

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.650
Some of you might
be familiar with it.

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:17.810
You can use it to pay
with your Android phone

00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:21.530
in stores and in apps.

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:25.340
A few months after we launched
Android Pay, a team at Google

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:29.570
conducted some research around
the app's brand strategy.

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:32.990
And what they found was that
the brand characteristics

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:35.570
we were initially
emphasizing, things

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:40.100
like simplicity and security,
were things that people just

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:41.600
expected of a payment method.

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:45.120
They weren't differentiators.

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.340
This pushed our team to
think a little bit more

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:50.550
about what the Android Pay
brand should look like.

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:52.470
And for me, when
thinking about what

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:55.690
words should go in
the user interface,

00:22:55.690 --> 00:23:00.300
this meant going beyond the
basic UX writing principles.

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:03.150
If we really wanted to
connect with our target users

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:04.800
and get more than
just the most tech

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.100
savvy to adopt this
new way of paying,

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:13.230
we needed to give Android
Pay a unique brand voice.

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:15.840
Now Maggie and Allison
both talked a little bit

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.900
about the Google brand
voice, and since Android Pay

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:21.240
is a Google product,
we definitely

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:24.330
wanted to stay
true to that voice.

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:27.390
But there are many
Google products,

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:29.670
and each one serves
a different purpose

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:33.900
in people's lives, which means
that each product's voice can

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:37.770
and should sound a
little different.

00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:40.140
Android Pay is also
distinct from some

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:42.510
of the other more
established Google products,

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:44.490
because mobile
payment apps are still

00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:49.270
seen as a thing of the future,
especially here in the US.

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:52.830
And research showed that
we had an opportunity

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:56.070
to appeal to the more emotional
dimensions of the Android Pay

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:58.800
experience like the
excitement people feel

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:03.000
the first time they successfully
pay with their phone.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.140
These are the moments where
we can give Android Pay

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:10.350
a recognizable personality.

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:13.920
Here's one example of how
we've done that visually.

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.220
The Android Bot, which
is part of the app logo,

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:19.830
comes to life on the
payment confirmation screen

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:22.740
to celebrate different
holidays and events.

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:26.160
As you can see, he dressed up as
Darth Vader just a couple weeks

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:29.730
ago for May the 4th.

00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:33.820
It takes a combination of
visuals like this and words

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:36.300
both working together to
bring your product's brand

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:39.150
voice to life.

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:41.760
Right now, I'm just going
to focus on the writing

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.190
side of things and walk
you through how we've

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:46.260
started to develop
the Android Pay voice

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:51.102
and how we bring that to
life through our UX writing.

00:24:51.102 --> 00:24:52.560
The hope is that
this will give you

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.380
all a sense of how
you can start to do

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:55.505
the same for your products.

00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:03.510
So it's best to start with
a set of brand principles.

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:06.150
These can be just three
or four adjectives

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:09.060
that you feel embody your
brand and represent how

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:12.330
you want people to perceive it.

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:14.160
A fun brainstorming
exercise you can

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.830
do to help you come up
with these principles is

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:22.700
to imagine you're signing your
product up for a dating site.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:26.390
What words or info would
you put in your product's

00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:28.317
dating profile?

00:25:28.317 --> 00:25:29.900
What is it about
your product that you

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:34.250
think would stand out or be
most interesting to people?

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:38.970
What will make them swipe
right and want to learn more?

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:40.820
You can then distill
these qualities

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:43.700
into descriptive words,
which will become your brand

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:46.040
principles.

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.300
We did this exercise
with our team,

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:51.440
including designers,
researchers, engineers,

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:54.770
product managers, and marketers,
and we all got together,

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:56.450
and we did some brainstorming.

00:25:56.450 --> 00:26:00.140
And based on that, as well as
the research that was done,

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:03.230
we ultimately defined
the Android Pay brand

00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:11.870
as fresh, empathetic,
and approachable.

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:14.330
Once you have your
brand principles,

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:16.040
the next step is
to think about what

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:18.410
these principles will sound
like when you apply them

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:20.210
to your writing.

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:23.930
And these will become
your writing guidelines.

00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:27.950
For example, to sound
fresh, we decided

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:32.540
we need to write in a way
that's snappy and exciting.

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:34.460
This principle comes
into play a lot

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:37.490
when we're trying to really
grab a user's attention

00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:39.740
and really hook them.

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:41.690
And sometimes this can
be before they've even

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:44.270
started using our app.

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:48.170
When someone types, Android
Pay, into Google search,

00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:52.310
one of the top results takes
them to our marketing website,

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:55.190
where they'll see a series
of imagery and headlines

00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:57.410
like this.

00:26:57.410 --> 00:26:59.990
Here, we have a chance
to really pull people

00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:04.310
in and get them to think,
I need to try this app.

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:06.950
And that's where the
snappy language comes in.

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:07.951
Headlines like, "Tap.

00:27:07.951 --> 00:27:08.450
Pay.

00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:09.700
Splash," and, "Tap.

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:10.200
Pay.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:13.210
Tasty," not only
highlight the tap

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:17.240
and pay functionality behind
Android Pay, but also the fun

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.100
things you can buy with it.

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:22.700
They show that how you pay can
be equally as exciting as what

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:23.570
you're paying for.

00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:30.180
Empathetic-- we
know that changing

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:32.280
the way you do an
everyday thing like paying

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:37.020
can feel uncomfortable and
maybe even a little scary.

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:40.290
So to counteract that, we
try to write in a way that's

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:43.710
helpful and reassuring.

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:47.220
Often, this means anticipating
the questions or concerns

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:49.449
a user might have
and proactively

00:27:49.449 --> 00:27:50.615
providing them with answers.

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:58.060
On this screen, we do just that.

00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:02.230
First, by saying, "Enjoy
quick setup with this card,"

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:03.790
we're reassuring
the user that they

00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:05.410
won't have to go
through that dreaded

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:10.300
process of typing in a credit
card number on their phone.

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:11.770
Then we explained
that we've pulled

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:14.510
in this card from
their Google account.

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:17.080
That way, they're not left
wondering where in the world

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.669
we got this information.

00:28:19.669 --> 00:28:21.460
Through our language,
we want to show users

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:23.980
that we're doing
everything we can to help

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:25.120
make their lives easier.

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:32.280
Approachable-- this one
means we want everyone

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:33.960
to feel like they
can use Android Pay,

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:38.130
that it isn't just for
the most tech savvy.

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:40.350
To convey that
feeling in our app,

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:44.370
we write in a way that's
friendly and conversational.

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:47.730
This means eliminating the
jargon and the formalities

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:51.120
and simply talking to
users in the same casual,

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:55.560
easy to understand way
we talk to our friends.

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:58.290
When we're explaining to
users how Android Pay works,

00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:02.940
for example, we don't
talk about NFC or HCE

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:05.310
technology, because the
average user would likely

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:08.370
have no idea what that means.

00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:11.910
Instead, we talk in terms
everyone can understand.

00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:15.205
Unlock your phone, and hold it
to the terminal at checkout.

00:29:15.205 --> 00:29:17.705
We don't need to get into what's
going on behind the scenes.

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:23.870
That should give you an idea
of how brand principles can

00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:27.080
be applied to writing, and
once you have your own brand

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:30.074
principles in writing
guidelines in place,

00:29:30.074 --> 00:29:32.240
you should start to have a
pretty good sense of what

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:35.840
your product's voice
will sound like.

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.840
Then you can take
it a step further

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.590
and think about what
your voice will sound

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:42.270
like in different contexts.

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:46.440
This is often
referred to as tone.

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:49.290
An easy way to remember the
difference between voice

00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:54.990
and tone is to think
about it like a person.

00:29:54.990 --> 00:30:00.270
A person's voice always
stays the same, right?

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:02.460
But the tone they
talk to you in may

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:04.770
change depending
on the situation

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:08.130
or what they're saying.

00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:10.500
In an app, this
might mean talking

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:14.490
to users in a different way
during a celebratory moment,

00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:19.554
like when they've just
won a prize, versus when

00:30:19.554 --> 00:30:20.970
their network
connection goes out,

00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:24.450
and they're seeing
an error message.

00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:27.360
For Android Pay, we mapped
these different moments

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:31.230
in the user journey on a tone
spectrum ranging from serious

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:33.180
to whimsical.

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:34.710
This helps us make
sure that we're

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:38.250
using our voice in a consistent
way across the entire user

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:40.260
experience.

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:42.660
For your product, the
two ends of the spectrum

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:45.210
might be labeled differently.

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:48.210
Your tone might range from
informative to inspiring

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:51.510
or direct to humorous.

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:53.100
These are just a
couple examples,

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:57.120
and you'll be able to tell
what works best for your brand.

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:59.820
It can also vary a lot depending
on what type of product

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:03.360
you're building and
who the audience is.

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:08.100
Once you have the two ends
of your y-axis labeled,

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:10.650
you then need to determine what
moments in the user journey

00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:13.716
you're going to map.

00:31:13.716 --> 00:31:15.090
A good way to do
this is to think

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:18.930
about the distinct milestones
or interactions in your user

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:20.340
experience.

00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:23.190
These can be things like
onboarding, education,

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:25.950
or troubleshooting.

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:30.630
To help you decide where these
will fall on the spectrum,

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:36.310
you can then think about
what the user's goal is,

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:40.720
what they might be
feeling in that moment,

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:45.790
as well as what you'd
like them to feel.

00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:47.410
To give you an
example, I'll show you

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:52.220
where we mapped a few of the
Android Pay user touch points.

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:56.450
The first impression-- when
we're making a first impression

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:59.084
on the user, we aim for
a very whimsical tone,

00:31:59.084 --> 00:32:00.500
because we're
trying to get people

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:03.320
excited about Android Pay.

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:05.720
This could be when they're
seeing an ad, opening

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:10.307
the app for the first time,
or, as I showed you earlier,

00:32:10.307 --> 00:32:12.140
landing on our marketing
site, where they'll

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:14.177
be greeted with a
whimsical headline

00:32:14.177 --> 00:32:16.010
and a rainbow sprinkled
donut to go with it.

00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:25.240
When the user is setting up
the app or using it to pay,

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:28.580
our tone still falls on the
whimsical end of the spectrum,

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:31.450
but to a lesser degree.

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:33.230
That's because in
these moments, the user

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:34.990
is trying to get
something done, so we

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:36.980
don't want our personality
to get in the way.

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:44.180
Error messages fall on the more
serious end of the spectrum.

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:46.970
When a user sees an error,
they might be frustrated,

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:53.010
so this isn't the right time for
too much personality or humor.

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:56.280
Needless to say, we're
not going to tell the user

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:58.230
that something's
up with their card

00:32:58.230 --> 00:33:01.980
or to holler at their bank, if
they're having an issue adding

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:05.190
their credit card to the app.

00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:07.800
Instead, we want to
be straightforward

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:11.800
about the issue, and
tell them how to fix it.

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.970
So we'd say, your card
couldn't be added,

00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:16.110
and contact your bank.

00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:23.600
All right, you've
established your voice,

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:25.610
and you've mapped your tone.

00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:30.290
Now it's time to apply both of
these and do some UX writing.

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:35.090
It's time to decide what words
will go in your user interface,

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:38.750
and that ends up being a
combination of everything

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:41.600
we've told you today.

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:45.900
To be successful, UI text
needs to be clear, concise,

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:51.530
and useful, as well as
reflect your brand voice.

00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:53.070
To show you how
you can get there,

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:55.569
I'll quickly walk you through
what our writing process might

00:33:55.569 --> 00:33:58.027
look like.

00:33:58.027 --> 00:34:00.360
Let's say we're trying to
decide what to say to the user

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:03.894
the first time they
open Android Pay.

00:34:03.894 --> 00:34:05.310
We can guess that
they're curious,

00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:09.239
so we probably want to tell them
what they can do with the app,

00:34:09.239 --> 00:34:11.850
as well as give them reason
to move beyond this screen

00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:14.940
and set it up.

00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:16.650
At the beginning of
our writing process,

00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:21.469
we might start with something
long and descriptive like this.

00:34:21.469 --> 00:34:24.870
Pay with your phone in stores,
and enjoy quick checkout

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:27.300
in apps.

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:31.020
Then we think about the three
principles of good UX writing.

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:37.350
This text does feel clear and
useful, but it isn't concise.

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:39.810
So we think about what
pieces of info are essential

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:41.580
and which ones could
be communicated

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:44.239
through visuals instead.

00:34:44.239 --> 00:34:47.909
And we might edit it to
something like this--

00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:50.730
"A faster way to pay."

00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:53.460
With this new
version, we've checked

00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:59.340
off clear, concise, and useful,
so we have just one step left.

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:02.970
We need to think
about voice and tone.

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:09.210
We'd ask ourselves, does this
text clearly convey our brand?

00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:10.140
Not really.

00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:12.630
It feels pretty generic.

00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:14.250
So going back to our
brand principles,

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:16.830
we think about how we can
make it feel fresher and more

00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:19.710
exciting, maybe even
whimsical, since this

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:23.130
might be our first
impression on the user.

00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:25.830
And in our final
iteration, we might end up

00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:28.950
with something like this--

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:33.120
"Everything you need to
speed through checkout."

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:35.140
It's a little longer than
the previous version,

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:38.700
but that can happen when you
add personality to UI text,

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:41.520
and it's up to you whether
infusing that personality

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.460
is worth the extra words.

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:48.240
And it isn't always
a clear decision.

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:51.270
If you're not sure whether more
words will be more effective

00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:56.250
or whether a certain word will
be more effective than another,

00:35:56.250 --> 00:35:58.980
A/B test it.

00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:00.990
From experience, we
can say that when

00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:04.060
you're trying to find the
right words for your product,

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:08.460
you should never underestimate
the power of A/B testing.

00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:11.010
Through an A/B test we
ran on the Start screen

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:14.850
in Android Pay, we discovered
that changing the button text

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:21.900
from "Add Card" to "Get Started"
resulted in a 12% increase

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:24.060
in click-throughs.

00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:26.640
Pretty amazing.

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:30.330
A/B testing is a great way to
validate a hypothesis you might

00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:34.390
have or to decide between two
different versions of text,

00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:36.900
if you're just not sure
which one will connect more

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:39.670
with your users.

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:41.850
Now I'll hand it back to
Maggie to wrap things up

00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:44.640
and to share a handy checklist
you can start applying

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:46.085
to your own UX writing.

00:36:46.085 --> 00:36:49.869
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:49.869 --> 00:36:51.035
MAGGIE STANPHILL: Thank you.

00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:57.140
Thank you, Juliana.

00:36:57.140 --> 00:37:01.620
So we've heard from Allison
about the best practices in UX

00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:04.220
writing, heard about
brand voice just now,

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:07.730
and I wanted to reflect
on our first sad screen.

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:10.260
I think we can do better, right?

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:12.200
All right, let's
apply what we learned

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:14.960
and do a quick on-brand edit.

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:18.530
So a simple way to make this
much more positive and much

00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:21.560
more useful is, "Ready
to add some friends?

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:23.450
Import your contacts."

00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:26.570
So adding that simple call to
action, import your contacts,

00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:29.510
could help the user get started
and, ultimately, have a better

00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:32.570
relationship with this app.

00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:35.240
So we hope what we
shared with you today

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:38.540
will be a helpful
reference as you get back

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:41.720
to work after this
great few days at I/O,

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:44.750
and consider how you might apply
some of these best practices

00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:46.380
to your product.

00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:48.230
So a quick run-through--

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:50.300
we recommend that you
always think about the user

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:52.790
first, focus on the
user, and all else

00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:56.810
will follow is a mantra we
love to think about here.

00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:57.980
Be clear.

00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:00.410
Write in language
that's free of jargon

00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:03.530
and with sufficient context.

00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:05.090
Be concise.

00:38:05.090 --> 00:38:07.970
Write in a style that's
economical and scannable.

00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:12.110
Remember the F shape pattern
that Allison described.

00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:13.060
Be useful.

00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:15.525
Write in a way that
guides the action.

00:38:15.525 --> 00:38:17.150
And if you don't have
a call to action,

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:19.660
you might want to add one.

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:21.120
And be on brand.

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:25.670
Define your brand voice, and
flex your tone accordingly,

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:28.400
as Juliana described.

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:31.280
Finally, whenever
possible, be data-driven.

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:35.170
If you can apply A/B testing
or other user testing,

00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:38.090
it's a great way to test your
knowledge of your language

00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:41.900
and how well it's
resonating with the user.

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:45.770
In sum, I want to, first and
foremost, thank these two

00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:46.820
amazing contributors.

00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:47.810
We'll be up front.

00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:51.260
If you guys have questions,
please come up and ask them.

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:53.270
We hope that what we
shared with you today

00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:57.380
will help you make your product
stand out with language.

00:38:57.380 --> 00:38:58.490
Thank you so much.

00:38:58.490 --> 00:39:02.298
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:04.202 --> 00:39:08.560
