00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.420
The third type of relationship that we saw, is

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:07.060
Generalization. Generalization is a relationship, between a general class,

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.150
which we normally call super-class and the more specific

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.510
class, a class the refines the super-class and that

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.950
we normally call sub-class. It's also known as a

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.690
kind of or is a relationship because we can

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.850
say that the subclass is a super class and

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.450
it's expressed with a solid line with a big arrow

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.580
head at the end. So let's see an example of

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.160
that. In this case I'm going to indicate. Two of this kind

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.950
of relationships. The first one involving the RegistrationUser and

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.000
a student. And the second one, a RegistrationUser and the

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.960
professor. So, basically what we're showing here is a

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.170
typical case in which the registration user is a more general

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.630
concept then the Student and the Professor. So both the student

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.710
and the professor are RegistrationUsers. So there is a relationship,

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.360
the Professor is a registration user and the Student is a RegistrationUser.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.780
And therefore we can indicate that using

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.040
the generalization relationship in our class diagram.
