00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.620
From Pi...tof...

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.360
(Just...Pitof?)

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.620
comes a solemn reminder that no matter
 what happens with the new Wonder Woman,

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.980
the bar for female-led superhero movies is really...

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.220
REALLY...

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.160
LOW!

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.600
"Meow!"

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.720
"Catwoman".

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.560
Before you see the best DC has to offer,

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.160
revisit the worst.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.940
In this sloppily directed,

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.620
insanely edited,

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:53.920
terribly written,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.700
ridiculously acted pile of cat barf,

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.680
that came out just one year before "Batman Begins",

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.040
but feels more like the spiritual sequel 
to "Batman and Robin".

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.380
"Chicks like you give women a bad name."

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.660
Meet Selina Kyle --

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.060
Haha, just kidding! This movie has NOTHING to do
with the source material.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.920
Meet some random lady named Patience Phillips,

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.500
a graphic designer with two of
film's horniest co-workers.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.180
"We have our ways, hmm?"

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.560
"Man sandwich, twelve o' clock!"

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.220
She's supposed to be a frumpy nerd, but since 
Halle Berry is the exact opposite of that,

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.660
they'll just bury her in plus-size clothes
and make her super clumsy.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.300
"Oh! I'm sorry!"

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.860
*glass breaks*

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.860
Everything will change when a cat French kisses
her dead body on a pile of garbage.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.880
Patience will become Catwoman, a woman
with the literal powers of a cat, like:

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.180
Hissing,

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.780
*hiss*

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.580
getting off to catnip,

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.680
*sniffing*

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.000
and eating disgusting amounts of tuna.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.160
*eating noisily*

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.500
But instead of, oh I don't know,
seeing a doctor about any of this,

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.960
she'll just Google the phrase "Cats period women",

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.040
and give herself a haircut.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.240
*scissors snipping*

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.640
Watch a film that takes a step forward
in representing a female superhero,

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.780
take eight steps back by having her
do battle...against moisturizer.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
EEEVIL moisturizer!

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.100
As cosmetics exec Sharon Stone gets to vent some of her personal frustrations with Hollywood...

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.640
"I was everything they wanted me to be."

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.680
"And then I turned forty."

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.780
"They threw me away."

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.280
...while releasing a product that's 
a class action lawsuit waiting to happen.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.900
"You stop using it...and your face disintegrates!"

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.660
You know, I'm pretty sure that product gets recalled 
without Catwoman doing anything.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.520
She could literally sit her own movie out 
and nothing would change.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.900
Revisit an era where superheroes hit their low points,

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.420
full of iconically crappy moments like:

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.000
the playground scene,

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.800
the emo dance,

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.280
and the Bat credit card.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.740
"Never leave the cave without it."

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.760
But not to be outdone, "Catwoman" makes its contribution to garbage culture

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.400
in the weirdest game of basketball ever filmed.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.780
Why are they just standing and dribbling for each other?

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.880
That's not how basketball works!

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.540
Stop shaking your ass at him, kids are watching!

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:17.540
Ugh!

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.800
WHYYYYY?!

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.080
So look out boys, 'cause this ain't
the superhero movie for you.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.220
And step back girls, 'cause it's not for you either.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.080
Or you, Batman fans.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.060
Or you, person with eyes and ears.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.960
This is a movie made for NO ONE, about NOTHING,
that NEVER should have existed,

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.380
whose only positive contribution to the world was
Halle Berry's Razzie speech.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.380
"Thank you for putting me in a
piece of sh**, god-awful movie!"

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.660
At least she's a good sport about it!
Now just apologize for that toad line, and we're good.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.480
"Do you know what happens to a toad 
when it's struck by lightning?"

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.400
"The same thing that happens to everything else."

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.140
Hey, it's not like Marvel is doing much better
at this point, either.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.460
*sai swishing sounds*

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.720
Uuurghhh...
