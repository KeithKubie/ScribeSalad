so my question to you is how is the ICC
going to continue its investigation and

00:39:31.999 --> 00:39:32.009
going to continue its investigation and
 

00:39:32.009 --> 00:39:34.940
going to continue its investigation and
prosecution in Kenya when there seems to

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:34.950
prosecution in Kenya when there seems to
 

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:37.970
prosecution in Kenya when there seems to
be such little local cooperation and

00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:37.980
be such little local cooperation and
 

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:47.859
be such little local cooperation and
support for what you're doing the ICC

00:39:47.859 --> 00:39:47.869
support for what you're doing the ICC
 

00:39:47.869 --> 00:39:52.789
support for what you're doing the ICC

00:39:52.799 --> 00:39:56.210
set the the opening date starting date
of the Kenya trials there are two Kenya

00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:56.220

there are so many variables here we we

00:40:23.269 --> 00:40:23.279
there are so many variables here we we
 

00:40:23.279 --> 00:40:25.160
there are so many variables here we we
don't know what's going to happen even

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:25.170
don't know what's going to happen even
 

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:28.579
don't know what's going to happen even
just there's no tomorrow to the Kenya

00:40:28.579 --> 00:40:28.589
just there's no tomorrow to the Kenya
 

00:40:28.589 --> 00:40:33.009

in Kenya politically and otherwise their

00:40:59.569 --> 00:40:59.579
in Kenya politically and otherwise their
 

00:40:59.579 --> 00:41:05.890
in Kenya politically and otherwise their
political process should not affect the

00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:05.900
political process should not affect the
 

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:13.150

tradition work of the ICC

00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:13.160
 

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:23.690
at the moment I must admit that for

00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:23.700
at the moment I must admit that for
 

00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:28.400
at the moment I must admit that for
example the logistics aspects of the

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:28.410
example the logistics aspects of the
 

00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:32.210
example the logistics aspects of the
Kenya case for example it is not

00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:32.220
Kenya case for example it is not
 

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:36.009
Kenya case for example it is not
necessarily easy because these four

00:41:36.009 --> 00:41:36.019
necessarily easy because these four
 

00:41:36.019 --> 00:41:39.440
necessarily easy because these four
suspects are under the summons to appear

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:39.450
