00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.420
&gt;&gt; Lauryn Oates: Hi, everyone.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.040
It's a tremendous privilege to
be here, I've already learned

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.070
so much and the day
isn't even half over.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.260
So, I'm from Canada, I
don't know if you can tell

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.760
from the name of
our organization,

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.900
which is Canadian Women
for Women in Afghanistan,

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.250
a little bit of a mouthful.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.630
And also, that we say
about properly in Canada,

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.950
we'll teach you Americans
to do that one day.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.020
So, the program I'm
here to present

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.920
on is called Afghanistan
Lowalee!

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.370
Which means Afghanistan
reads in Pashto,

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.490
and it's an adult literacy
program that has been

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.320
in about 10 provinces so far in
Afghanistan out of 34 provinces.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.470
And it really came about
from the observation

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.960
of literacy programs
in Afghanistan,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.420
which are fairly ubiquitous.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.410
It's a country with one of
the lowest literacy rates

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.790
in the world, and there's been
a real drive to addressing

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.820
that from the Afghan government
and the donor community,

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.600
and from Afghans themselves.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.260
But there hasn't been as much
progress as there should be.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.610
And one of the indicators
that tells us this is a survey

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.770
from UNICEF in 2011 found
that, even of women,

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.320
adult women who had some
primary school educations,

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.900
so from anywhere
from grade one --

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.230
from one grade up
to sixth grades,

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.620
29% of them were illiterate.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.320
And this was tested
by the surveyor,

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.900
they were asked to
read a sentence.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.730
So, we don't know if that
means that they had literacy

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.320
and they lost it, or that they
never actually gained literacy

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.500
despite having gone to school.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.050
And in my own evaluations
and observations

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.840
of literacy programs, we see
typically, the approach is

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.620
to run a literacy
class for a year,

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.430
and maybe the students
can do well

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.230
on testing immediately
after the class.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.880
But, if you find them six
months later or a year later,

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.350
they're not functionally
literate.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.810
So, we -- we're asking
ourselves, why is this?

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.940
And we suspected that
the answer might be

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.660
that there were no books
in the literacy classes.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.000
There were the textbooks
for literacy,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.090
but these were textbooks
meant for grade one kids,

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.790
and adults were being
asked to read them.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.610
So, we thought, hmm, maybe
there should be books

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.200
in a literacy program?

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.470
So, I'll get right into the
program, but I just wanted

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.250
to mention, our organization
has been around since 1996,

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.030
we are a volunteer drive
organization in Canada.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.440
We have chapters in a
dozen cities in Canada,

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.750
and a country office
in Kabul, Afghanistan,

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.000
and regional offices
around the country.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.110
And our goals are two-fold, one,
to improve the status of women

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.170
and girls, and we see education
as key to the empowerment

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.760
of women and girls
in Afghanistan.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.670
And secondly, to raise
awareness about the struggle

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.440
for human rights in
Afghanistan among women

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.560
and girls among Canadians.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.210
So, we have three programs,

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.380
we work in the basic
education system trying

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.230
to strengthen the education
system for grades 1 to 12.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.520
And then, we also
have a program,

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.280
which is where Afghanistan
Reads!

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.500
falls into, the Community
Libraries and Literacy program

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.310
that serves the out
of school population,

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.930
or people who are aged 15 plus.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.720
We also actually
teach men and boys,

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.560
as well as women and girls.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.450
And our third program is
Technology for Education.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.030
So, in Afghanistan Reads!,
once we figured out this lack

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.820
of book issue as being the
problem, and hypothesized

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.250
that people were not
actually really having fun

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.730
in literacy classes.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.430
That it was a very hard and
dry task when you've never been

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.210
to school in your whole life.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.380
And as an adult, a hard-working
person, a lot of the women

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.270
in our programs are farmers.

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.660
They have a lot on their plate,
and you come to a classroom,

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.140
and you've got to go through
this drudgery of learning,

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.600
and it's just not something --

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.210
you don't really want to come
home at the end of the day

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.400
and read your dry textbook.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.610
So, we wanted to make it more
engaging and fun, and relevant

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.850
to their lives, and to really
build a love for reading,

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.510
and hope that this
would transmit actually

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.190
into the family.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.910
So, how we decided to do that is

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.200
to combine the literacy
classes with libraries.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.720
So, we made the literacy
teacher a librarian,

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.330
we'd give them a training
in literacy pedagogy,

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.220
but also in basic librarianship
and reading promotion.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.990
And we put mini-libraries
in the classrooms.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.450
And the classrooms
are home-based,

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.450
so we have 20 students
in a class.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.050
We pay a little bit of money to
a local woman in the village,

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.560
and use her living
room as the class,

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.470
so it's very cheap for us.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.560
And they get a library, and the
teacher goes through a program

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.860
where they learn how

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.070
to encourage the
students to borrow books.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.900
And they take them home,
and they do a whole series

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.690
of reading promotion
activities as part of the class.

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.590
And we do a few other
things as well

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:05.890
that we think are
a bit different

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.410
than other programs
in the country.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.690
We do life skills, so we
integrate things like nutrition

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.980
and health, and hygiene in
with the literacy curriculum,

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.600
as well as livelihoods.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.080
So, in our communities that's
mainly rural livelihoods,

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.670
so farming and agribusiness.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.190
And then, the fifth
element is the transitions.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.710
We want these women to go
on to further opportunity.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.430
Whether that's enrolling
in public school

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.640
and making their way
through the grades,

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.840
or going into a vocational
training program.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.430
So, currently, we have about
a 21% rate of women going

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:41.900
on to other opportunities.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.150
So, this is sort of the program

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.200
of how we do the
reading promotion,

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.530
so we have reading consultants
work with the teachers,

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:52.910
and help them pick activities

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:54.630
that are suitable
for their classrooms.

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.600
And we call it the
Literacy Activities Menu,

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.000
has 25 activities
they can choose from.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.490
And the reading consultant
goes back to the community over

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.260
and over again to see how the
teacher is doing implementing

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.020
those activities, and doing
both mentoring and monitoring.

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:14.000
So, I'm happy to share that menu
with you if you're interested.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.090
So, I'll end here, and I invite
you to check our website.

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:21.230
We have a short video describing
the program there more.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.620
And we also have a separate
website called Darakhat-e-

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.570
Danesh, Knowledge Tree,
which is our digital library

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:28.500
for educators in Afghanistan.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.890
And it has a whole
range of subjects,

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.250
but we have a collection
on literacy education.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.770
And that digital library is in
Dari ,and Pashto, and English.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.180
So, the English speakers
will be able

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.720
to find some useful stuff too,
and it's all openly licensed.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.800
So, thank you very much
for having me here,

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.560
and I'm really excited to hear
the rest of the presentations.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.420
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
