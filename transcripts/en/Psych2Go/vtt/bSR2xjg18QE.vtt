00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.000
Sweaty palms nail biting and pacing back and forth in your room are all habits

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.239
You're probably already familiar with when you have anxiety

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.789
But our bodies also have a surprising way of doing strange things when we worry

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:04.769
Sometimes the unconventional route is also an uncomfortable one here are six weird things

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.919
Anxiety causes you to do number one

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.989
you have ice cold hands and feet and Marie Alfano an

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.939
associate professor of medical psychology at Columbia University Medical Center

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:26.339
States when you're anxious your blood flow is redirected away from your extremities and towards your larger organs in your torso

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.309
This is why it makes it hard for your blood to circulate

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.299
Well that keeps your hands and feet warm when you feel as though you might be in danger your body enters the fight-or-flight

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.729
Mode to prepare yourself to survive

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.739
Unfortunately anxiety isn't rational and causes you to feel this

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.629
Number two you experience gas problems and frequent urination

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.549
Sounds embarrassing

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.369
right

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.968
But this is unfortunately true being anxious causes you to have an overactive gut

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:04.920
Albano states gas is created when the acid in your stomach is churning while nervousness runs throughout your body when you're anxious

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.878
You may also be prone to eating and drinking too quickly

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.559
Frequent urination is commonly experienced too when you're anxious

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:21.450
Your muscles tense up and your body puts pressure on areas such as your bladder and abdomen that makes you one of urine able

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.299
Although these experiences sound uncomfortable. They're nothing to be ashamed of if you're concerned

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.059
You can talk to your doctor about solutions to these symptoms

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.889
We hope that by talking about anxiety people can be more accepting of it

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:41.279
Please be sure to also check out our video thirteen things people don't realize you do because of your anxiety

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.789
to stay educated on the matter number three

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.310
You catch yourself yawning a lot albano states some individuals

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:57.720
Especially with generalized anxiety or pets tend to breathe more rapidly than the average person as a result

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:04.379
Rapid breathing tricks the brain into thinking you need more oxygen, which causes you to take deep

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.209
Inhales. So the next time someone thinks you're yawning because you're bored or tired

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Inform them that it could be anxiety

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.839
Number four you get rashes on your skin?

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.109
Anxiety can give you an uncomfortable pitch

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:21.819
metaphorically and

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.789
physically albano states that being anxious can frequently cause you to experience

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:33.299
Skin allergies and problems such as eczema. That's because when people find themselves highly stressed

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.149
Extra cortisol, which is the stress hormone

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.489
Rushes through the bloodstream as a result the skin starts to feel

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.139
Irritated and rashes begin to develop if you experience this issue often

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.009
We advise you to talk to your doctor about ways to alleviate it

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.509
Number five you often space out and have trouble concentrating

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.479
Entering a dream light state sounds relaxing and even ideal for escaping your troubles

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.840
but having severe anxiety can cause you to have

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:11.459
Out-of-body experiences when things start to feel too overwhelming. You may find that everything around you feels unreal

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.809
Including the body that you're in this is because of the fight-or-flight

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:23.970
Mode you enter which prepares you to deal with the current issue by eliminating stimuli nearby. That's too much for you to handle

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:32.069
number six you hear phantom rings and you have anxiety you may constantly be sitting on edge and

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.260
Anticipating something one of those events may be a phone call or text message from somebody

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.689
You've been waiting to hear back from as a result. You may hear your phone ring or buds

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:49.830
only to check it and find the sound was all in your teeth researchers call this phenomenon ring, xiety or

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:58.260
Phantom ringing for instance people in a relationship with high anxiety may also develop a strong attachment to the partner

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:01.319
So if they're worried their partner isn't as committed

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:06.899
They may expect the worst and think they're talking to someone else to reduce phantom ringing

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:12.690
It's important to talk about the anxieties you have with your partner. It may also be wise to

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:19.380
Disconnect for a while and embrace nature instead does anxiety cause you to do these strange things
