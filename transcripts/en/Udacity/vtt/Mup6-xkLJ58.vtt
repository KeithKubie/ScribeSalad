The connection between the virtual and the real one is becoming closer every

00:00:03.338 --> 00:00:07.100
day. One aspect that I find particularly exciting is how objects we design in

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.988
the virtual world can be made real just a few hours later. Even if you don't own

00:00:10.988 --> 00:00:15.034
a 3D printer, you can order 3D printed objects from a business that does. For

00:00:15.034 --> 00:00:18.630
example I found this teapot model on the web at Sculpteo, a 3D print service

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.814
provider based in France. I previewed it on the website in Web GL, picked out

00:00:22.814 --> 00:00:26.708
the material, and ordered it. At that point, there was no physical model, it was

00:00:26.708 --> 00:00:30.460
just data on a computer somewhere. A week later, when the real thing arrived

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.806
here in California, that honestly amazes me. To learn more about the connection

00:00:34.806 --> 00:00:38.823
between 3D graphics and 3D printing. Jessie Harrington Au and I talked about

00:00:38.823 --> 00:00:41.113
these topics while at the Autodesk gallery.
