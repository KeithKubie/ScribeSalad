00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.960
SDN has many advantages over conventional networks. It's

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.350
easier to coordinate behavior among a network of devices.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.600
The behavior of the network is easier to evolve,

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.120
and it's also easier to reason about. These characteristics

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.100
are all rooted in the fact that the

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.940
control plan is separate from the data plan. Having

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.850
a separate control plane or control program allows us

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.710
to provide conventional cs techniques to old networking problems.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.200
So as before it was incredibly difficult

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.790
to reason about or debug a network's behavior

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.660
if the network behavior is now controlled

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.780
by a logically centralized control program. We can

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.420
use techniques from programming languages or software

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.710
engineering to help us reason about the behavior

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.140
of the network. As far as SDN's

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.750
infrastructure is concerned, the Control Plane is typically

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.930
a software program written in a high level language, such as Python or C,

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.860
on the other hand the Data Plane.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.350
Is typically programmable hardware that's controlled by

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.820
the control plane. The controller effects the

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.930
forwarding state that's in the switch using

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.730
control commands. Open flow is one standard

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.850
that defines a set of control commands by

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.439
which the controller can control the behavior of one or more switches.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.330
SDN has many applications including data centers, wide area

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.220
backbone networks, enterprise networks, internet exchange

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.950
points or IXPs, and home networks. Later

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.210
modules in this course will explore how software defined networks. Can solve

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.300
network management problems in some of these areas. In this

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.320
course we will focus in particular on the first three applications.
