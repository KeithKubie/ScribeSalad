00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.680
So this is what I came up with.

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.380
Remember, this is the shape that we're going for.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.970
I started off by drawing the outer rectangle by using strokeRect.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.120
We wanted it to start at 50, 50 and then it needs to be 100 by 100 pixels wide.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.450
Then we began the path.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.350
The path starts at 75, 75.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.290
So that just takes the pen and moves it here.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.910
Then we move it to 125, 125, but we create a line there.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.020
So the pen goes down and moves over.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.020
Then we create a line up to 125,

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.710
75 which takes the pen back up, and then actually we can stop there.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.130
With that shape, with that drawing, we can actually start to fill in.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.710
So, then we call fill and we'll get this.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.840
Let's go ahead and see if this code works.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.050
Okay. I've saved the file let's come over here and hit refresh, and low and

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.380
behold we see the shape that we were going for.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.990
At this point you got the basics down for drawing.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.070
I recommend having some fun with it.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.480
See what kind of cool, crazy drawings you can make and post them in the forums.
