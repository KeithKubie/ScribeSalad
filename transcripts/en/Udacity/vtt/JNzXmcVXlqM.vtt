00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.850
Another problem with ECB is
that the plain text blocks

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.210
are encrypted into ciphertext
blocks independently of each other.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.310
Therefore an attacker can use
a previously captured ciphertext block

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.290
to sub out a current ciphertext block.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.720
Or we arrange the order
of the ciphertext blocks.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.070
The result is violation
of message integrity.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.590
For example the attacker can
fabricate specific information.
