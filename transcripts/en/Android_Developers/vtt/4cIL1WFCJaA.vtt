00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.800
Elex is a very open-minded company.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.560
Your job title doesn't stop you
from pushing to make things happen.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:21.920
This is achieved through your level of
initiative, passion and professionalism.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.480
My involvement with Elex
started with Clash of Kings.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.720
Gamers can form communities

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.560
with other alliance members,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.160
increasing their power
and expanding alliance territories.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.920
You can fight against other alliances
and gamers in different countries.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.040
&lt;i&gt;Clash of Kings really is a global product

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.120
so real-time translation
is a very important feature.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.840
We use Google Translate
to translate our games.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.800
After gamers edit their language lists,
they see the changes automatically.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.280
We then cache and take note
of sentences that frequently occur,

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.960
and use them to speed up
the translation even more.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.160
&lt;i&gt;Clash of Kings is not only available
&lt;i&gt;on smartphones but also tablets.&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.080
As a game developer, we consider
how to develop the contents of our games

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.600
according to the brands and models.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.200
Elex is a very unique company.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.640
It challenges a lot of old philosophies
within game production,

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.680
and so we learn a lot of new things.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.960
The advantage of the Android platform
is that it's open and accessible.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.800
It is especially easy for us
to handle customer management

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.600
and very effective for
internal games management and support.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.480
The "Ratings and Reviews" function
is very helpful.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.920
We can get insightful feedback
from our game users

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.480
which is very important to us.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.200
Elex began when we were
five students at Beihang University.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.200
Our dream is to bring Chinese creativity
to the global market.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.200
The globalisation plans of Elex have been,
firstly, to go beyond mainland China,

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.680
and enter Southeast Asia.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.840
The cost of acquiring users
in this region is relatively low.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.560
There are a large number of these users
on Google or the Android platform

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.920
to help us progress.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.400
The second stage
is entering Europe and the US markets.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.760
Google has a very large market share
in these regions,

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.240
including high-value users.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.600
It has the right resources
to help with this type of marketing.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.600
The third stage is the hardest -

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.720
how to deepen our roots
in more difficult markets,

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.680
such as Japan and the Middle East.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.400
We are now at this third stage.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.120
We have collaborated with Google
in many ways.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.520
We have carried out "in-app promotions"
in many regions to help us boost revenue.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.480
We have also held many gift card events,

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.480
letting unpaid gamers experience
the same fun as paying gamers.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.240
This has increased
the number of paid users.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.880
We have been working with Google

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.400
to hold lots of activities at online
and offline gaming weeks and festivals,

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.840
which allowed gamers to join in on
other fun parts of the gaming experience

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.800
and increase user participation.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.720
Our goal is to become
a world-class gaming company.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.800
And so we need be successful
on the Android platform.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:31.880
We do it our own way with innovative ideas
so we can achieve our dreams rapidly.
