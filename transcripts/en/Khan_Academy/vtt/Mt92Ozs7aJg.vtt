00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.680
- [Instructor] We are
asked to find the value

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.440
of this indefinite integral.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.210
And some of you, in attempting
this, might try to say,

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.370
all right, is the numerator
here the derivative

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.700
or a constant multiple of the
derivative of the denominator?

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.170
In which case, u-substitution might apply,

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:16.700
but it's not the case here.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.010
So what do we do?

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.240
And my hint to you would be
partial fraction decomposition,

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.300
which might invoke some memories
from a precalculus class

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.270
or maybe from an algebra 2 class,

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.170
but it's a technique to break
up this rational expression

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.460
into the sum of two rational expressions.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.160
And a good hint there is the fact that

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.380
this denominator here is factorable

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.320
into these two expressions.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.320
So what we're gonna try to do

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.730
with partial fraction
decomposition is say,

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.673
can we express x-5 over (2x-3)(x-1),

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.960
can we express it as a sum
of two rational expressions,

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.550
where the denominator of the
first rational expression

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.620
is 2x-3,

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.270
and the denominator of the
second rational expression

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.270
is x-1, and I don't have to
put parentheses there, is x-1.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.300
Now we don't know the numerators.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.060
As you might have learned before,

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.390
and I encourage you,
if this the first time

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.820
you're ever seeing partial
fraction decomposition,

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.370
look that up on Khan Academy.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.110
We have many videos on it.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.300
But the general principle here

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.120
is that your numerator is
gonna be one degree less

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.953
than your denominator.

00:01:19.953 --> 00:01:21.470
So our denominators here are first degree,

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.480
so our numerator's gonna be
zero degree, or just constants.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.190
So it's gonna be some
unknown constant data.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.040
Let's call that A.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.080
And some unknown constant B.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.520
And our goal is to solve for A and B.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.430
And this is all a review.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.530
This isn't really calculus.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.480
This is more precalculus now, or algebra.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.340
How do we solve for A and B?

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.570
Well, let's add them

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.010
as if we're just adding two fractions

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.600
with unlike denominators.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.270
So we wanna have a common denominator.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.103
So what we wanna do

00:01:45.103 --> 00:01:48.700
is multiply this first rational expression

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.690
by x-1 in the numerator
and the denominator.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.400
So you could call this A(x-1)

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.650
over (2x-3)(x-1).

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.950
And then for this second
rational expression,

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.820
we'd multiply the numerator
and the denominator

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.400
by 2x-3.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.680
So (2x-3)B

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.530
over (2x-3)(x-1).

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.300
And now, since I have the same
denominator, I can add them.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.570
And the goal is when I add 'em,

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.460
and I think about the
numerator, I will try to say,

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.170
well how do the A's and B's line up

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.720
to what we have already, right over here?

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.010
So this is going to be
equal to, same denominator,

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.967
so the denominator's (2x-3)(x-1),

00:02:34.473 --> 00:02:35.306
and then in the numerators,

00:02:35.306 --> 00:02:36.640
actually, let me do it over here.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.930
This is the same thing as
Ax-A, just distributing the A,

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.410
and if I distribute the B here,

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.060
this is the same thing as 2Bx-3B.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.654
And so if we add the numerators,
we can add the x terms,

00:02:52.654 --> 00:02:57.654
Ax+2Bx, so we could call that (A+2B)x.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.113
And then if we add these
constant terms, -A, -3B.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.580
And since we have a minus right over here,

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.770
I'm gonna try to pattern match,

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.900
so I'm gonna have minus,

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.450
and I'll write that as -(A+3B).

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.810
If you distribute this negative sign,

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.510
then you're gonna get -A and -3B.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.830
So these are equivalent.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.460
And now we can see the pattern.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.150
We say, all right, our
denominators are now the same,

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.960
so this thing in our numerator has to be

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.870
the same thing as x-5.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.730
So whatever our coefficient here is on x,

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.370
that's gotta be equal to 1,
that's the coefficient on x.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.160
And this thing that we're subtracting,

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.400
that's gotta be equal to 5.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.250
And we're gonna set up a system

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.910
of two equations with two
unknowns to solve for A and B.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.480
So we know that A+, so
let me write that down,

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.480
we know that A+2B needs to be equal to 1.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.663
And we know that A+3B, or A+3B,

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.670
is going to be equal to 5.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.440
And so now, to solve for A and B,

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.770
well, we could do that by elimination.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.170
So let's see, what if we
multiply this top equation by -1.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.170
So that'd be -A, -2B, -1,
and now we add them together.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.620
The whole point was to cancel out the A's,

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.810
so we're left with -2B+3B,
that's just going to be B,

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.780
is equal to 4,

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.290
and then we can substitute
back in to solve for A.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.840
So let's say right over
here, we know that,

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.633
we know that A+3x4,

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.330
so that's gonna be 12,

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.240
I'm using this equation right over here,

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.340
is going to be equal to 5.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.340
Subtract 12 from both sides,
you get A is equal to -7.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.500
So just like that, we can
rewrite this entire integral.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.130
We can say this is going to be equal to

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.540
the indefinite integral
of, open parentheses,

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.170
A over 2x-3.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.520
We now know that A is -7,

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.970
so it's -7 over 2x-3,

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.650
and then we're going have +B, B is 4,

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.240
so, +4 over x-1,

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.860
over x-1, and close parentheses, dx.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.830
Now if you are so inspired,

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.240
I encourage you to pause the video

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.110
and try to run with it from this point,

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.640
because we have seen the
techniques to solve integrals

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.000
like this before, but
I'll do it step by step.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.110
This is going to be the same thing as,

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.260
well actually let me just,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.610
so this is going to be the same thing as

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.160
the integral of, so 2x-3.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.840
I could write the -7 here,

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.200
but I'm gonna take the
constant out of the integral.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.910
So I'll put a -7 here.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.340
And to help us solve this,
and this could be a 1,

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.320
but to help us solve this,

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.870
it would be nice if we had a 2 here.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:53.720
Why is that?

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.760
Because 2 is the derivative of 2x-3,

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.130
and so then we can do our u-substitution,

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.410
which we have, sometimes,
gotten practiced doing

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:02.610
a little bit in our head.

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.990
And so if we want this to be a 2,

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.410
we can't just multiply by 2.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.140
We've also gotta divide by 2.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.820
And I can do that outside,
'cause that's just a constant

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.210
dx+, well the derivative of x-1 is 1,

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.720
so we just want a 1 up in the numerator.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.920
So we can take the 4 out of the integral.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.920
4 times the integral of 1 over x-1, dx.

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.820
So this is going to be equal to,

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.320
we just have our constant out front, -7/2,

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.610
and since we have this
thing in the denominator,

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:34.860
and we have its derivative,

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.840
we can really just think
about this as integrating

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.230
with respect to this
thing in the denominator.

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:40.920
You can sometimes view u-substitution,

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.970
which I'm not explicitly going to do here,

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:44.570
as the reverse chain rule.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.230
The antiderivative of 1
over x is the natural log

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:48.780
of the absolute value of x,

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.010
but here, this is going,
the antiderivative of this

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.730
is going to be the natural log

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:56.520
of the absolute value of 2x-3.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.053
And then for this part, it's gonna be +4,

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.160
times the antiderivative here

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.100
is the natural log of the
absolute value of x-1.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.110
Once again, I can do that,

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:11.240
'cause the derivative of x-1 is just 1.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.810
And of course, since we're
taking an indefinite integral,

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.660
we do not want to forget our +C.

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:17.523
And we're done.
