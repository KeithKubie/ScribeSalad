00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:04.300
MIKE: Danielle is sending us
to Zipp's massive collection

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.770
of militaria in South Carolina.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:07.900
MIKE: Oh, my gosh...
FRANK: This is it.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.570
MIKE: He's a collector,
he's a historian,

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:10.630
and he's a wild man.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:11.870
[dog barking]

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.670
MIKE: Hey, puppy.
FRANK: Hey, bud.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.130
MIKE: Look at that sign.
FRANK: I know.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.430
Looks pretty mellow.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.900
[dog whining]
[knock on door]

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.930
[dog barking]
MIKE: Are you Zipp?

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:20.930
ZIPP: How're you doing?
That's me.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.230
MIKE: Hey, I'm Mike.
Nice to meet you.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.270
Can we look around
a little bit?

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.270
ZIPP: Yeah.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.300
MIKE: So do you
specialize in vehicles?

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.430
I saw, when we
came down the road,

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.330
you got a bunch of Jeeps
and trucks and everything.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:29.970
ZIPP: Yeah, rent them out
to production companies

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.100
and all like that-- this,
that was in Forrest Gump...

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.700
MIKE: That was in Forrest Gump?
ZIPP: Yes, it was.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.170
I had a 151 Army Jeep

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.000
that was in Dennis Hopper's
film Chasers.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.230
MIKE: So this was
in a Hopper movie,

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.800
this was in Forrest Gump.
ZIPP: Yeah.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.770
MIKE: Zipp was smart
to do the prop rental.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.930
One, it was showcasing
his collection;

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.470
and two, he was making
money from the collection.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:48.630
MIKE: So, are you
gonna sell this?

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.730
ZIPP: Oh yeah, I'm--
yeah, I'll let it go...

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.500
MIKE: So your plans
are to sell all the vehicles?

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.870
ZIPP: I want to get rid
of all this junk, man.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:54.900
MIKE: No kiddin'.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.200
ZIPP: I'm just
trying to downsize

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.700
my collection and everything.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.500
ZIPP: I'll give you a little
grand tour of some of my stuff.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.900
ZIPP: Let somebody else
pick up the torch, man.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.530
ZIPP: This right here
is a Vietnam-era M151 Army Jeep.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:06.600
MIKE: Wow.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.130
MIKE: It seems like
around every corner,

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.500
we're coming across
historic military vehicles.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.970
And I'm not talking just Jeeps;
I'm talking massive equipment.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.470
MIKE: It's amazing how much of
this stuff you've come across.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.800
ZIPP: You know what--
you know what they call these

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.900
in the military?
MIKE: What?

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.030
FRANK: Uh, donkey...

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.500
ZIPP: Donkey [beep].
MIKE: Yeah.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.730
ZIPP: I mean, I don't
want to say it,

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.070
but I'm just saying that's
what they call them.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.270
MIKE &amp; FRANK: You just said it.
ZIPP: Yeah, okay, yeah.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.830
[group laughing]

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.100
MIKE: Think of all
the time and energy

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.470
that it took to bring all of
this stuff to this property.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.430
ZIPP: I want all this stuff
gone, man, out of here.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.700
MIKE: So why
the change of heart?

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.100
ZIPP: I don't have time
to work with it, you know?

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.800
My kids are in the military.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.570
MIKE: Danielle said you
served in the military.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.670
ZIPP: Yeah.
MIKE: Hey, God bless you.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:44.670
ZIPP: I'm retired.
Thank you.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.730
FRANK: His kids
are still serving.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.130
I mean, his whole
family has served.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.130
His dad did; he did.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.170
This has been a family that
served our country from day one.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.300
MIKE: Can we look inside here?

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.570
ZIPP: You can look
wherever you want, man.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.230
MIKE: Alright.

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.600
ZIPP: Here's something neat.
FRANK: What'd you got?

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.700
ZIPP: I've had these since
I was-- way back there.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.800
FRANK: Century of leadership.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.600
ZIPP: The military's
WWII straps.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.230
MIKE: You think these are real,
the Wallace things?

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.570
ZIPP: I can guarantee you, man.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.130
I've had those since
I was like a teenager.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.930
MIKE: Oh, no kiddin'.
ZIPP: Yeah, really, man.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.100
FRANK: They've got some age.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.270
FRANK: George Wallace,
he ran for president

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.930
four times and didn't make it.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.200
FRANK: Zipp, what are
you thinking on this?

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.670
ZIPP: What do you got?
FRANK: Uh...

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:20.930
ZIPP: 'Cause I mean, these
are collector's items.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.230
FRANK: Well, they need
to be cleaned up a little bit

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.600
and stuff,
but I mean, how about...

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.400
How about $65?

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.700
ZIPP: Hm...

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.630
Man that's-- I mean...
FRANK: Go ahead, hit me.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.100
ZIPP: Probably about
$1,000 of stuff.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.000
I can go a bill on the whole
box, the whole thing, man,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.400
if you want it.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.000
FRANK: There's probably more
in there than I think, you know.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.600
ZIPP: There is a hell
of a lot more than you think.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.300
FRANK: Alright,
Zipp, let's do 100.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.570
ZIPP: Good.
Thanks, bud.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:45.600
FRANK: Alright?
No, thank you.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.800
FRANK: I think 100's fair,

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.100
there's quite
a few pins in here.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.770
I mean, once it all adds up,

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.270
I think I can at least
double my money.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.530
ZIPP: Oh, man.
MIKE: You got it?

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.670
FRANK: Yeah.
MIKE: Alright!

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.430
ZIPP: I think Mike and Frank
really appreciate

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.130
the history of the stuff
and everything.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.300
ZIPP: You're taking
all my play toys.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.900
MIKE: [laughs]

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.570
MIKE: We've been on a lot of
properties over the years.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.400
But this one is really
one of the most unique,

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.530
and definitely one
of the most historic.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.900
FRANK: See ya later, Zipp!
