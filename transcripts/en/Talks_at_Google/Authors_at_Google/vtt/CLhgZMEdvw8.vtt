00:00:06.664 --> 00:00:09.940
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm here to
introduce Lori Kenschaft.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.289
Lori describes herself as
an intellectual omnivore.

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:15.830
Her undergrad degrees
from Swarthmore

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.710
are in biology and religion.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.530
She got her master's
from Harvard Divinity

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.770
School in theological studies,
and her Ph.D. from Boston

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.000
University was in
American Studies.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.285
I describe Lori as a
personal friend, as well as

00:00:27.285 --> 00:00:29.074
an all-around
fascinating person.

00:00:29.074 --> 00:00:30.490
She hosts lectures
and discussions

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:31.864
on all sorts of
topics, including

00:00:31.864 --> 00:00:35.310
but not limited to politics,
economics, charitable giving,

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.470
religion, and mass
incarceration, the last two

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.430
being related to her positions
as clerk of the First Parish

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.500
Unitarian Universalists
of Arlington,

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.021
and coordinator of their mass
incarceration working group.

00:00:46.021 --> 00:00:48.520
Her diverse background gives
her an interesting and informed

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.260
perspective in all
of these topics.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.680
Today, she's here to talk
a bit about her third book,

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.444
"Gender Inequality in
Our Changing World."

00:00:54.444 --> 00:00:55.776
And I'll hand you off to Lori.

00:00:55.776 --> 00:00:57.520
LORI KENSCHAFT:
Thank you very much.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.304
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:00.304 --> 00:01:02.600
I want to thank all
of you for being here,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.150
particularly Jonathan
for inviting me,

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.880
and Tim for handling the
mechanics of making the thing

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.160
work.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.310
So just a brief background,
"Gender Inequality

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.060
in Our Changing World" is a
brand new textbook, sociology.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.140
I'm an historian, more
or less-- as we said,

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.110
intellectual omnivore.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.950
But I teamed up with a couple
sociologists to write this.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.340
And the reason we did this is
because the sociology of gender

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.135
textbooks that are
out there now tend

00:01:28.135 --> 00:01:30.010
to have been written in
the 1990s, when there

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.280
was this really sort of
triumphalist sort of idea

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.300
that the United
States is the norm,

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.560
everybody's headed our
way, Washington consensus.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.900
And they've had updated
editions since then,

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.630
but the fundamental
conceptualization

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.140
reflects that era.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.210
And it seemed to us that
we live in a much more

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.280
diverse and complicated
world than we did--

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.510
or than people thought
they did-- in the 1990s.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.470
And so we teamed
up together to try

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.790
to focus on what's
going on with gender

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.120
inequality in the
contemporary United States,

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.910
but really put it in a richly
international, global context,

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.750
and in an historical context.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.060
So we were focusing on
the theme of change.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.865
How do things change,
what is changing,

00:02:08.865 --> 00:02:10.740
what's changing more
quickly, what's changing

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.160
more slowly, all of this.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.595
It's one of those huge
topics that, if I'd

00:02:15.595 --> 00:02:16.970
realized what I
was getting into,

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.590
I probably would've said no.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.080
But in retrospect,
I'm glad I said yes.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.789
And I'm very grateful that
you are all here today.

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:26.830
What I'm planning to do
is what I call a flyover.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.320
It's a 450-page book,
or something like that,

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.700
and I'm going to try to
talk about it in 30 minutes.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.940
So there's no way I can
touch on everything in there,

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.062
but I'm just giving you a
flyover perspective of what's

00:02:37.062 --> 00:02:38.520
in the book, and
some of the things

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.910
that I think people
might find interesting.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.000
I'm going to ask that, while I'm
going this quick speed through,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.480
people not comment or
question during the slides,

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.667
because several of these
I included in the book

00:02:51.667 --> 00:02:54.250
because they're so interesting
that, if I were in a classroom,

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.880
I could use them to do 20 or
30 minutes of conversation

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.150
right there in the classroom.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.840
And that's not the
goal for today.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.710
So please do not be
triggered by the slides

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.669
into conversation until
the end, and then there

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:06.584
will be time for Q&amp;A.
I'm going to try to keep

00:03:06.584 --> 00:03:07.870
this very hard to 30 minutes.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.920
Make sense?

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.790
So the first question is,
where is gender inequality?

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.630
And there are three
different maps

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.838
that I'm going to show you
that are looking at gender

00:03:18.838 --> 00:03:20.740
inequality on a global scale.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.750
This one is the United Nations
has a Gender Inequality Index.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.500
And any metric you
use, any index you use,

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.400
has its problems.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.830
Like this one makes
Saudi Arabia look

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.830
sort of the same as
the United States,

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.650
and that's because lots and
lots of women in Saudi Arabia

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.880
go to a university and get high
education because they're not

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.240
allowed to do anything else.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.160
Their brothers are allowed
to go work, go play sports,

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.900
be with friends, go
socialize, whatever,

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.170
and all the young women
can do is go to university,

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.410
so they go to university.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.850
And that makes the
society look like it

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.752
has very good equality for
women, if you measure it just

00:03:54.752 --> 00:03:55.417
by education.

00:03:55.417 --> 00:03:57.500
So clearly, we have some
problems with this index.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.950
But there are some patterns
here that are real.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.170
It is true that, by
many different metrics,

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.790
the United States has
more gender inequality

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.020
than most wealthy democracies.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.090
And the two places that
are changing most quickly

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.209
are China over the last
60 years and Latin America

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.431
over the last 20 years.

00:04:19.431 --> 00:04:21.180
And Latin America is
changing very quickly

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.830
also in terms of
economic inequality.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.610
It's the only
region of the world

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.930
in which economic inequality
has decreased over the last 20

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.332
years rather than increased.

00:04:30.332 --> 00:04:31.790
So there's interesting
things going

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.360
on in both of those countries.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.850
And in China, that's
very intentional.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.980
The communist government,
when it came in,

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.327
said, women hold
up half the sky.

00:04:40.327 --> 00:04:42.410
They said that girls had
to get primary education,

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.092
that employment had
to open up to women.

00:04:44.092 --> 00:04:46.550
And it takes a while for these
things to percolate through,

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.130
but China is
changing very quickly

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.480
as a result partly of
intentional policies.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.970
But that's not all
that's going on.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.890
So the next metric that
I would like to offer

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.770
is this is gender gaps
in life expectancies.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.270
And one of the key
distinctions here

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.170
that sociologists of gender,
gender studies people, use

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.010
is between sex and gender.

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.200
Sex is what we're born with.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.130
Whatever it is, however
complicated it is,

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.840
it's what we're
born with related

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.200
to reproductive
anatomy, and everything

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.290
that goes along with that.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.880
Gender is what cultures
make of that, how

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.250
cultures put meaning on that.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.730
So, sex, males are more
likely to die at every age.

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.160
That includes prenatally.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.900
So this is when nobody
knows, until recently,

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.120
what sex they are.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.910
So that has to do with sex.

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.990
Gender affects how that
happens, how quickly it happens,

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.200
the balance between them.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.432
There are societies in
which it's not true.

00:05:45.432 --> 00:05:47.390
There are societies in
which women die younger.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.920
That's high level of
gender inequality.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.670
There are societies
in which women

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.640
live much longer than
men, and that is also--

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.050
excessively longer than men.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.870
And that is also a form
of gender inequality.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.870
So the countries that
are marked in red

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.350
are the countries
where the gender

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:09.246
gap is too long, that men are
being disadvantaged by gender.

00:06:09.246 --> 00:06:10.870
And that has a lot
to do with violence,

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.494
has a lot to do with
alcohol, has a lot

00:06:12.494 --> 00:06:15.490
to do with
risk-taking behaviors.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.850
And then the blue countries are
where women are likely dying

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.770
of gender, although
in a few cases,

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.160
I think the gap is small because
medical care is really good.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.960
It's not like Iceland up there
is a particularly bad country

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.710
for women.

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.790
But that gives you
another perspective

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:36.230
on the patterns here
of gender inequality.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.870
Here's another
perspective on this.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:46.890
Again, if we have a natural
sex ratio-- and all of this

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.822
is a little difficult
to tell what's natural,

00:06:49.822 --> 00:06:52.030
because there's no culture
that doesn't have culture.

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.480
So we're sort of guessing
where the natural state is.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:00.190
But the natural state seems
to be that about 1.05 boys are

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:01.300
born for every girl.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.590
Of course, we really should say
105 boys for every 100 girls,

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.040
but.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.540
And there are a
variety of countries

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.600
where that's not true.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:14.370
So India, China, some
other smaller countries,

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:18.690
have many more boys per girl
than would be average born,

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:19.900
would be natural born.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.430
And that's because of
sex-selective abortion.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:28.170
And notice that India and China
together contain about 1/3

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:29.690
of the world's population.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.030
So when you have those
countries selecting strongly

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:35.375
for male births, that means
we have a real disproportion

00:07:35.375 --> 00:07:37.580
in the population.

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.670
The red countries
are where there's too

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:41.630
few girls-- boys born.

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:45.190
And the reasons for that are
not completely understood,

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:46.740
but I believe that
at least-- I'm

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.610
sure that at least
part of the answer

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:52.030
is that, when a woman is
stressed during pregnancy,

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:55.910
male fetuses are more likely
to miscarry, back to males

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:57.480
are more likely to
die at every age.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.580
Males are more fragile.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.570
So those countries are
countries, I believe,

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:05.090
in which women are so often
so stressed during pregnancy

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:08.570
that their sons in utero
are more likely to die.

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:12.200
So gender inequality
affecting both the woman

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.030
and the next generation.

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:17.030
So those are three ways
of thinking about what's

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:19.490
the big patterns here.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:21.800
There are four key
causes a of inequality

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.250
that we outline in the book, and
this is where the book starts.

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:26.410
Economics.

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:31.230
Nearly all societies use gender
to allocate who does what work,

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:33.470
and to give-- and
nearly all societies

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:37.610
give men preferential access and
control to economic resources.

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:40.480
The degree of that varies a lot,
how that works varies a lot,

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.520
but that seems to be
very, very common.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.830
Families.

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:49.920
Nearly all societies assign the
majority of unpaid family care

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.230
work to women.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.626
Child care, elder care,
cooking and cleaning,

00:08:53.626 --> 00:08:55.000
and just keeping
everybody alive.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.100
It seems to be women's
ultimate responsibility

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.580
to keep their families alive.

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.530
Control of sexuality.

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:03.800
Patrilineal societies
are societies

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:07.400
where family membership
and inheritance

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.600
are traced through
the man's line,

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.240
through the father's line.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.280
And the simple frame of
that is you get the name

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.060
of your father's family.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:18.530
But in patrilineal
societies, there

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:21.200
are many societies
where only sons inherit

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:25.720
from their fathers,
or only fathers

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.600
can bequeath to their
sons and daughters.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.220
But it's all
through the fathers.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.405
Matrilineal societies,
you trace inheritance

00:09:33.405 --> 00:09:34.530
through your mother's line.

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:36.821
Now, this results in very
different types of societies,

00:09:36.821 --> 00:09:39.566
because obviously we
all know-- a given baby,

00:09:39.566 --> 00:09:40.940
we're pretty sure
who the mom is.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:43.270
We're not necessarily
sure who the father is.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:45.610
And so societies that are
patrilineal and consider

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:48.005
patrilineal tracing
to be really important

00:09:48.005 --> 00:09:50.600
have to control
women's sexuality,

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.070
their reproductive capacity.

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:54.610
And that means basically
all of their behavior,

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:57.500
so that there can't be any
doubts about which baby

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:58.910
is assigned to which man.

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:00.881
And how stringently
that's done varies a lot,

00:10:00.881 --> 00:10:02.380
but there's a
fundamental difference

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:04.880
between patrilineal and
matrilineal societies.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.120
The vast majority of people have
lived in patrilineal society.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.860
And then, violence.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:15.430
Traditional societies
worldwide expect the male head

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:17.890
of household, the
men who are in charge

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:19.850
of the family and,
therefore, the society,

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:22.190
to maintain discipline
within the families.

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:25.200
And usually violence is
an acceptable method.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.760
And in addition, nearly
everywhere the threat

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.299
of sexual violence
constrains women's lives

00:10:30.299 --> 00:10:31.590
in a variety of different ways.

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:33.560
There's a lot we
could say about that.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.890
So starting with
economics, the type

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:40.630
of economic system
that a society has

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:42.830
affects the degree of
gender inequality in it.

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:45.100
And it's not a
tight correlation,

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.490
but sociology is always
about loose correlations.

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.120
There's always going to
be exceptions to the rule.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.990
Hunting-gathering
economies, you share food.

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:55.240
You can't really own much
in the way of anything else,

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.281
because you have to be
able to carry it with you.

00:10:57.281 --> 00:10:59.780
There isn't much economic
inequality to be had.

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:03.150
Horticultural economies, which
use hoes and other hand tools

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:06.100
but don't have big plows
or domestic animals--

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:09.450
big domestic animals-- tend
to have separate cultures

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:10.200
for women and men.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:14.350
They use gender to assign
the work roles very strongly,

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:18.220
but there tends to be a sort of
balance of power between them.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:21.020
Agricultural and pastoral
or herding economies

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:22.760
tend to be the most unequal.

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:25.120
They tend to have what's
called family economies, where

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.780
the whole family-- whatever
that definition is--

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:30.410
works together to
keep everybody alive,

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:32.860
to create all the things
that are necessary.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:36.972
And the men of the family are
given control of the resources

00:11:36.972 --> 00:11:39.305
that are necessary, ownership
of the land or the animals

00:11:39.305 --> 00:11:40.990
or whatever their
core resource is,

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:43.780
and also the right, and
therefore the responsibility,

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:45.520
to control the
family labor force.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.640
i.e., the women and children.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.900
So that's the most
unequal type of society.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:52.520
In industrial
economies, you begin

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.850
to open up room for individuals
to earn their own incomes,

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:58.490
including for women to
earn their own incomes.

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:00.540
And that makes it
possible for women

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:03.320
to have a degree of independence
that is impossible in a family

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.440
economy.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.287
This affects obviously
the women who

00:12:07.287 --> 00:12:09.370
are earning their own
incomes, but it also affects

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:10.828
women who aren't,
because they have

00:12:10.828 --> 00:12:14.640
that possibility available
culturally, economically.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.290
And so industrialized
societies tend

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:21.720
to increase gender
equality, increase the focus

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:25.970
on the individual as the
unit of decision-making.

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:28.120
Knowledge-based economies
like the one we're in,

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.710
especially here in this
building, value intelligence,

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:34.460
expertise, creativity,
social and relationship

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:36.420
and emotional skills,
and the ability

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.680
to sit still and
focus and concentrate.

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.190
These are all skills
that women tend

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:42.360
to have at least as much as men.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.530
And so in knowledge-based
economies,

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:48.700
there tends to be
increased gender equality.

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:52.540
Although, as we have seen,
nowhere has become gender

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.520
equal.

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.220
In the United States,
now if you look

00:12:56.220 --> 00:13:00.480
at young adults aged 25
to 29, 37% of the women

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:03.820
and 30% of the men have
a bachelor's degree.

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:06.970
So we're really
seeing a shift there.

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:09.480
But if you control
for education,

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:13.380
then men earn more than women
in every demographic group,

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:17.690
including young singles,
unmarried, don't have kids.

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:20.150
The sort of most
free individuals,

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:24.420
still men earn more than
women if you correlate,

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:25.540
correct for education.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:32.330
Two key factors are important
for increasing gender equality

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:33.120
within families.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.850
Again, if we look worldwide.

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:38.250
One of them is women having
access to reproductive health

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:41.400
care-- contraception,
abortion, maternity care--

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:46.970
and not having genital cutting,
particularly infibulation.

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:48.520
Women's lives--
you know, it just

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.910
affects so many things
in a woman's life

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:53.300
if she can control when
she's going to have children,

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.560
and if she has a really good
chance of surviving childbirth,

00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:00.680
which, in some societies,
each time a woman gives birth,

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:05.250
she risks dying and her children
risk ending being motherless.

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:09.160
The other key thing is if
men bond with their children

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.129
and become engaged
with their infants,

00:14:12.129 --> 00:14:13.670
they are much more
likely to continue

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:16.440
to care for their children
throughout those children's

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.039
lives.

00:14:17.039 --> 00:14:18.830
So this is where we
see this sex and gender

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:24.330
thing, that it really
makes a difference when

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:28.250
what's seen sociologically
is that when men take

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:31.550
paternity leave, some amount
of time when their infants are

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:35.120
small that's long enough
to bond with that child,

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.470
that affects how they
behave as fathers

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:39.050
for the rest of their lives.

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:42.830
So that requires paid
paternity leave, or generally

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:44.880
paid paternity leave to
be available to have this

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:48.020
be really common, and policies
that overcome social pressures.

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:51.250
So in most countries,
maybe all countries,

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:53.780
there's some degree
of stigma against men

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:55.945
who prioritize child care.

00:14:55.945 --> 00:14:58.570
And the countries that have been
most successful in getting men

00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:02.587
to do this are the ones that
create maternity leave first,

00:15:02.587 --> 00:15:04.420
and then what's called
parental leave, which

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:06.160
can be taken by other
parent, but they

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:10.350
require men to take some amount
of paternity leave dedicated

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:12.025
for men first.

00:15:12.025 --> 00:15:14.150
And then either parent can
take the parental leave.

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:16.726
And those societies are
seeing-- the stats--

00:15:16.726 --> 00:15:18.100
I'm sure there's
a limit to this,

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:20.700
but for each month
of paternity leave

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:23.730
a man takes, his-- the
mother of his children,

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:26.950
not always his wife--
has a 7% increase

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:28.600
in earnings in the future.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.620
So this is really significant.

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.940
One note here is
that women tend to,

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:37.230
in the United States and
other advanced countries--

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:40.350
economically advanced
countries-- still are having

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:42.540
huge what's called
motherhood penalties,

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:46.430
that when a woman
is a mother, she

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:50.150
earns less and is less likely
to get hired or promoted really

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:53.304
for the rest of her life, even
if you control for experience.

00:15:53.304 --> 00:15:55.720
It's not just oh, she took
some time out of the workforce,

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:59.039
she's a little behind
in accumulating

00:15:59.039 --> 00:16:00.080
education and experience.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.340
Even if you control
for that, women still

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:04.350
earn less if they are mothers.

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:08.120
Men, on the other hand, earn
more if they are fathers.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.407
And it's not just because
they tend to work more,

00:16:10.407 --> 00:16:11.990
which the men did
when they have kids.

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:13.864
They say, OK, I really
need to focus on this.

00:16:13.864 --> 00:16:15.720
Even if you control
for that, men

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:17.950
tend to earn more
if they are fathers,

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:21.940
get this fatherhood bonus,
as long as they do not--

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.190
there are two criteria.

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:26.160
One, if a man spends
significant time taking

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.536
care of his own
children, then he

00:16:27.536 --> 00:16:28.910
doesn't get the
fatherhood bonus.

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:31.520
Like if he takes that paternity
leave, probably won't get it.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:32.570
And if he has brown skin.

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:38.050
You have to be white to
get the daddy bonus, which

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:41.580
is related to, but not the same
as, African American men are

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:43.880
much more likely than
white American men

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.722
to be equal or close to
equal partners around taking

00:16:46.722 --> 00:16:47.680
care of small children.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.460
So there's a lot of different
factors going on here.

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:51.420
OK.

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:54.580
This is one of my
favorite charts.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.220
This is about
control of sexuality,

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:58.970
but using it from a more
statistical point of view.

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:02.080
If you look at the percent
of people in a society saying

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.500
that their society should
accept homosexuality,

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.825
there's a strong correlation
with the per capita GDP.

00:17:08.825 --> 00:17:12.400
This is $70,000
there, $0 down there.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.329
And as you can see, there's
a pretty strong correlation.

00:17:15.329 --> 00:17:17.230
But there's also a
lot of diversity.

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:20.109
And that diversity, I
would argue, is cultural.

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:22.930
So there are countries,
or whole regions,

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:26.510
that are much more likely
to accept homosexuality

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:30.470
than others than
predicted by their GDP.

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:32.690
So these sort of
purple dots up there,

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:34.520
those are European countries.

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:36.740
And they tend to be
relatively embracing.

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.660
These green dots here are
Latin American countries,

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:45.410
which are poor, but also
more embracing for their GDP.

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:48.690
These red countries down
here sub-Saharan Africa.

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:51.220
Don't be born there
if you're gay.

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:54.870
And then these are Muslim
majority countries,

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:56.580
those orange dots.

00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:00.190
This is the United States,
which is pretty tolerant but not

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:02.270
nearly as much as
you would think based

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:04.820
on its GDP, statistically.

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:06.560
And the reason this
is so important,

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:08.680
it's not just because
of what it means

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.790
for gay folk in these
societies but also

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:14.490
because what tolerance
of homosexuality means

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:17.540
is a belief that sexuality
belongs to the individual.

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:20.720
That in this traditional,
family-based patrilineal

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.240
systems, sexuality
belongs to the family.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:26.090
It is part of
reproducing the family,

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:28.450
it is part of creating
that labor force.

00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:31.050
Women's bodies are
very tightly controlled

00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:35.620
so that the family has its
official integrity, often

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:38.830
described as
purity, kept intact.

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:42.480
The more a society
sees sexuality

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:43.990
as an individual
thing, something

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:45.520
about individual
choice, something

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:48.860
about individual preference
and pleasure and relationship,

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:52.152
but a matter of individual
choice, the more people go hey,

00:18:52.152 --> 00:18:53.610
it's a matter of
individual choice.

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:56.380
You can choose who
you're going to be with.

00:18:56.380 --> 00:19:00.460
So this is a metric for
how much a society has

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:03.020
moved from seeing
sexuality as a property

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:04.950
of the family to
seeing sexuality

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:07.210
as a property of the individual.

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:09.790
So it's a very important
graph from that point of view.

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:12.780
And again, this is what I mean
by Latin American countries

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:13.800
are changing quickly.

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:18.510
Violence.

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:21.140
Some key things to
know about violence.

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:23.270
Men commit the vast
majority of violence,

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:26.210
both what's socially
approved and what's not.

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:28.180
And that's about
maintaining social order.

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:29.810
It's about defending
the community.

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:32.310
There's some evidence that
maybe the classic Vikings

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:34.110
were an exception to that,
that women fought equally.

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:35.650
But in the modern
world, there don't

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:39.930
seem to be any exceptions,
and very few historically.

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:44.430
Men are also much more
likely to die violently.

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:48.570
In 2008, they were about three
times as likely as women.

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:51.040
And that's common,
that men worldwide--

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.880
this is worldwide
statistics, obviously--

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.230
are roughly, give or take
year by year, three times

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:57.930
as likely as women
to die violently.

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:00.120
But violence against
girls and women

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:02.910
lie behind many of those
other forms of inequality.

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:05.300
That's how you enforce
family discipline.

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.790
That's how you exclude
women from the workplace

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:09.370
and from the street.

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:13.410
That's how a lot of
these things happen.

00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:14.000
Key point.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.560
Violence is not inevitable.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:18.130
It's not just oh, men
are going to be violent.

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:19.760
This is back to the
sex/gender thing.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.200
Because levels of
violence vary enormously

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.730
between different societies,
and within one society

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:26.270
they can change quite quickly.

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:28.020
They can also change
over the generations.

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:31.510
Those Vikings, those
warlike notorious Vikings,

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:34.700
are the ancestors of the
modern peaceable Scandinavians.

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.300
It's the same gene pool.

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:39.370
So it's not about the genes.

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:42.410
And then as of
2011, violence had

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:45.250
decreased, whether one
looks at decades, centuries,

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:46.020
or millennia.

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:47.950
And here, I highly
recommend Steven

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:49.880
Pinker's "Better
Angels of Our Nature:

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:52.190
Why Violence has Declined".

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:54.340
The book draws a lot of that.

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:57.137
I can do only a little bit
with it, but it's a great book.

00:20:57.137 --> 00:20:58.720
And he documented
this and then talked

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:01.600
about a variety of
reasons why that's true.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.680
What's going on in
Syria has caused

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:07.310
an increase in violent
deaths, but it's too soon just

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:08.960
tell whether that's
sort of a blip

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.960
in the grand historical
chart or whether it

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.870
means some sort of trend.

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:16.370
So this is not as true over
the decades now as it was,

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:17.670
but we may be going back.

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:20.140
I hope so.

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:22.920
So this is drawing again
from Steven Pinker's work.

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:26.370
When government is not
trusted to provide security

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:29.250
and justice, people
have what he calls and I

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:34.150
call self-help justice,
where-- in my society,

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:36.239
if somebody robs my
house, I call the police.

00:21:36.239 --> 00:21:37.780
I say help, somebody
robbed my house,

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:39.196
and they hopefully
find who did it

00:21:39.196 --> 00:21:40.900
and, you know, they
take care of it.

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:43.460
Whereas in a traditional
society, if somebody steals

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:46.014
something from you, there's
no police to call on,

00:21:46.014 --> 00:21:47.680
right, there's no
government to call on.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:51.370
So you have to be willing
to exact retribution.

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:53.480
More to the point, you
need to have a reputation

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.210
to exact retribution
so that they

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:57.300
won't steal from you
in the first place,

00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.430
and they won't beat you
up in the first place,

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:01.400
and they won't kill
you in the first place.

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.400
So it's a family-level thing.

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:07.310
And that's called honor,
that having that reputation

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:10.630
for being quick to
respond to insult

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:13.910
is essential for preservation
of groups in societies

00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:16.420
where there is no government
that can provide protection

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:17.680
to families.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.340
So you get this
culture of male honor

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:20.990
which gets intertwined
with this idea

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:23.720
of female purity, the
patrilineal society family, all

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.000
of that.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.590
In such societies, girls
have little schooling,

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:30.350
women are economically
dependent on their men,

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:32.700
on their families, there's
high levels of violence

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:36.100
within the families as well as
between families, high death

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.750
rates, high birth rates--
those need to go together--

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:41.810
high levels of poverty, high
risk of political violence

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:44.990
and war, all of which reinforces
ineffective government.

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:48.160
There's a spiral going on here.

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.580
When girls get
educated, things change.

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.630
This seems to be
one of those levers.

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:54.730
So women are able to
contribute more economically

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:55.950
if they're more educated.

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:58.140
Families become more
economically stable,

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:00.890
because there's more people
able to do more diverse things.

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:03.420
Child mortality
decreases really quickly.

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:06.330
Giving women-- giving
girls a primary education

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:09.470
really affects the survival
rates of their children.

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:11.870
Birth rates decrease,
because families are like oh,

00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:15.720
hopefully my kids will survive
so I can have fewer of them.

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:18.550
And women have more choice
in whether to have children.

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:22.015
So the next generation is
better educated, it's healthier,

00:23:22.015 --> 00:23:26.460
it lives longer, and the
population size stabilizes.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:29.280
Women have more say in their
families and communities.

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:34.024
And one of the things they
do is use those families

00:23:34.024 --> 00:23:35.940
and communities to create
structures that help

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:37.270
them keep their kids alive.

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:39.440
It seems to be one of
those universal things.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.160
If you give women
political power,

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:45.880
one of the first things they
go for is clean water supplies.

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.972
And governments provide
more public services.

00:23:47.972 --> 00:23:49.430
It's a little more
complicated what

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:52.600
women do in countries like
ours, in the United States,

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:55.280
but in countries where
you're just on the edge,

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.810
women really like clean water.

00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:01.470
So poverty goes down,
public health improves,

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:04.340
violence decreases,
chances of war decreases.

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:07.146
Another spiral, but going
a different direction.

00:24:07.146 --> 00:24:08.520
So here's how to
encourage girls'

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:10.330
schooling in poor countries.

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:12.350
And there's a lot of
different parts of this.

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:15.870
You need schools, but you also
need the teachers and books

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:17.840
and internet access.

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.427
Quality is really important.

00:24:19.427 --> 00:24:21.510
There's a lot of places
in this world where people

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:23.700
can go to school
for several years

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:26.420
and still not really become
literate or numerate.

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:30.517
And when parents see that their
girls are not getting educated,

00:24:30.517 --> 00:24:32.850
they're much more likely to
take the girls out of school

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:36.050
because girls' labors is always
needed at home, always needed

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:36.610
in families.

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:38.776
And if the girl isn't
benefiting from the schooling,

00:24:38.776 --> 00:24:40.692
girls are more likely
to be withdrawn.

00:24:40.692 --> 00:24:42.150
Of course, it's
good for boys, too,

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:45.100
that they actually learn
something in school.

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.220
Make girls safe on the
streets and in school.

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:48.330
The violence thing.

00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:51.380
Provide safe bathrooms
and sanitary supplies.

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:53.480
There are parts of the
world, like Pakistan,

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:58.830
a third of the schools have no
bathrooms and no running water.

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:01.830
And when girls go
off into the fields

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:04.520
or whatever to relieve
themselves privately,

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:06.500
they are more likely
to get assaulted.

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:09.365
This is particularly a problem
once girls start menstruating.

00:25:09.365 --> 00:25:13.010
There are places where
pilot studies have just

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:16.052
given out menstrual pads, and
girls' attendance-- adolescent

00:25:16.052 --> 00:25:18.010
girls are much more likely
to go to high school

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:22.230
if they have something
they can be private with.

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:23.770
Conditional cash transfers.

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:27.075
These are huge in-- particularly
Brazil and Mexico are

00:25:27.075 --> 00:25:29.700
best-known, but there's lots of
countries around the world that

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:33.060
are giving cash transfers
to mothers-- much

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:36.220
more than fathers, because they
use the money differently--

00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:40.006
but to poor families if
they meet certain criteria.

00:25:40.006 --> 00:25:42.380
And typically, that includes
sending their kids to school

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:45.400
and getting basic medical
care, including immunizations.

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:50.510
And that really increases both
education and the well-being

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:53.000
of the next generation.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.413
But unconditional cash
transfers can work, too.

00:25:55.413 --> 00:25:56.996
There's been pilot
studies done in-- I

00:25:56.996 --> 00:26:00.080
think it's Morocco and Malawi
where you just give families

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.581
a little bit of
cash, not very much,

00:26:01.581 --> 00:26:04.163
and they're much more likely to
send their daughters to school

00:26:04.163 --> 00:26:06.519
because they're pulled away
from that edge of survival.

00:26:06.519 --> 00:26:08.810
And many families want their
daughters to go to school,

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:11.300
they just can't afford it.

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:15.961
Reproductive health care, again,
mothers being in good shape

00:26:15.961 --> 00:26:18.210
means their daughters are
more likely to go to school.

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:19.860
And focus on
disadvantaged groups.

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:22.590
Nowadays, if you look
at primary education

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:24.471
and you look at
the dominant group,

00:26:24.471 --> 00:26:25.970
I think it's every
country or nearly

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:28.040
every country,
maybe every country,

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:30.920
there's gender parity
at the primary level.

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:33.380
The place that we really
hurt around gender parity

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:36.540
on the primary level is
in marginalized groups

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:37.760
within countries.

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:39.860
Usually ethnic groups,
could also be a caste.

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:42.800
That's where you see gender
inequality within the country

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:43.680
at the primary level.

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.510
It gets more
complicated after that.

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:49.440
So those are key things
to keep in mind when

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.760
we're were talking globally.

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.690
Focusing on the
United States, there's

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:54.420
two things I want you to know.

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:58.380
Gender inequality decreased
by many different ways

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:00.382
between 1970 and 2000.

00:27:00.382 --> 00:27:01.840
And since then, it
has leveled out.

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:04.520
We see this map over
and over and over again.

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.770
And then, educational levels.

00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:09.160
How much education people
have, which sociologists

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:12.545
use as a proxy for social
class, has a much larger impact

00:27:12.545 --> 00:27:17.730
on life patterns now than
it did in 1970 or before.

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:19.280
Or 1980 or before.

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:22.880
So here's one of my
graphs that shows this.

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:27.130
So this red line
is the frequency

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:30.940
of rape in victim studies, where
researchers get on the phone

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:32.492
and they call
households randomly

00:27:32.492 --> 00:27:34.200
selected around the
country and they say,

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:37.530
what crime have you experienced
in the last six months.

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:39.480
And they tabulate this.

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:45.600
And so if that-- that beginning
spot is 1973 normalized to 100.

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.810
And as you see, the
incidence of rape

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:54.360
has gone down by roughly
3/4, 80%, since 1973.

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:55.800
Big change.

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:59.450
But it has more or less
leveled out since 2000.

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:02.830
The dotted line up there
is the incidence of rape

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:04.510
as reported to police.

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:06.340
Most rapes are not reported.

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:09.567
But the police reports went up
and up and up during this time

00:28:09.567 --> 00:28:11.400
period when the rate
was actually going down

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:14.770
because of the work
to destigmatize rape

00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:16.830
that women became more
likely to report it.

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:18.510
Men too, but mostly women.

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:21.950
And then since around
1995, the reports

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:26.210
have gone down at roughly
the same incidence as what's

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:28.070
being done by victim studies.

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:31.330
And then this blue
line is the murder rate

00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:32.550
during this time period.

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:34.570
Again, by the same
normalization.

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:38.960
And as you see, the murder rate
has gone down by roughly 50%.

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.860
Violence in general
has gone down.

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:43.470
Lots of discussion, nobody's
really-- no consensus

00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:44.870
about why that's true.

00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:47.650
But the difference between
that and that, I would argue,

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:50.972
is gender, that there's an
increasing understanding

00:28:50.972 --> 00:28:52.930
that gender equality is
good, that women should

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:56.970
be able to say no,
that coercion is not

00:28:56.970 --> 00:28:58.980
a desirable part of masculinity.

00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:01.200
These are all changes that
are happening with gender,

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.800
and that's making
that difference, which

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:03.966
is a significant difference.

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:08.460
Another graph.

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:12.940
This is the divorce rate per
1,000 people starting in 1870.

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:15.540
This spike is right
after World War II.

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:19.080
Lots of people married
in haste and came apart.

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:22.170
This spike is often called
the feminist movement,

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:24.540
but I would say it's more
broadly all the changes

00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:26.640
of the 1960s, which were huge.

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.940
And couples didn't always
change at the same pace,

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:31.070
and became much more
likely to come apart.

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:34.090
But as you see, the divorce
rate has been coming down pretty

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:35.050
steeply since then.

00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:37.440
It's still high,
historically speaking,

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:41.290
but that's a trend line down.

00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:44.490
But if you look more closely
at different economic groups,

00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:46.930
it's all among
college graduates.

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:49.330
So these three
lines are for people

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:52.450
who are not college graduates,
and they started in the '70s,

00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:54.850
and this is when they got
married, and their chance

00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:56.820
of divorcing within 10 years.

00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:59.590
So those who got
married in the '70s

00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:02.410
had a significantly
higher chance of divorce

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:04.280
if they were not
college graduates.

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:09.370
But the difference is much
more now than it was then.

00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:11.240
And that is the
pattern that comes up

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:17.180
in one cluster of
statistics after another.

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:22.340
Here, this is life expectancies
among Americans since 1900.

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:28.620
And as the-- the blue
lines are for black folk

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:30.850
and the white lines
are for white folk.

00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:33.270
And the solid lines
are for women,

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:36.380
and the dotted
lines are for men.

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:39.280
That will be true in all
graphs of this source.

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:43.620
And as you can
see, in 1900, race

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:45.420
was the really big
determining thing.

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:48.400
We had this small gender gap
which indicates high gender

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:52.380
inequality, and race really
affected life expectancy.

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:55.040
As the century has gone on,
that's somewhat reversed.

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:59.330
Over here, race still has an
impact, gender has an impact.

00:30:59.330 --> 00:31:02.010
The gender gap for blacks
is significantly higher

00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:03.790
than the gender gap for whites.

00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:08.820
But gender and race are more
co-equal than they were.

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:12.610
If we look more narrowly
now to education,

00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:13.910
it's really different.

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:16.810
This is for Americans with
no high school diploma

00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:19.510
just since 1990 to 2008.

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:22.630
And this is the
line for white men,

00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:24.910
and that's the line
for white women.

00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:26.840
And as you can see,
life expectancies

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:29.020
for white Americans without
a high school diploma

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:30.330
have been going down.

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:32.780
They're now basically the
same as life expectancies

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:35.144
for black Americans without
a high school diploma.

00:31:35.144 --> 00:31:37.560
And there's a lot of things
that are correlated with that.

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.435
Since I sent in
these slides, there

00:31:39.435 --> 00:31:41.110
was a "New York
Times" article talking

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:45.520
about a recent study talking
about levels of suicide

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:48.600
and deaths related to substance
addiction, both alcohol

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:50.070
and illegal drugs.

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:53.250
There's a lot of despair going
on among less educated people,

00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:56.090
and that's related
to all of this.

00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:58.750
So the gap for
education is huge.

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:02.250
White men with a college
degree live 13 years longer

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:04.220
than white men without
a high school diploma.

00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:06.940
For white women, the gap
is only 10 and 1/2 years,

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:07.905
but that's a decade.

00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:13.980
Here-- this is one of those
things we could look at a lot,

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:18.470
but we won't-- this is
looking at full-time earnings,

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:21.260
median weekly earnings, by
gender and education since

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:22.530
1980.

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:26.370
Men's earnings average
decreased unless they

00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:28.159
had a bachelor's degree.

00:32:28.159 --> 00:32:29.950
These men up there with
a bachelor's degree

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:32.740
went up by 1/4 in terms
of their average earnings.

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:35.520
Women's earnings increased,
unless they did not

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:37.110
have a high school diploma.

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:38.920
So the general
trajectory for women

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:41.530
and the general trajectory
for men is really different.

00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:43.120
Here, men could
pretty much count

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:46.470
on earning more than women
in their social world.

00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:49.670
Now, not as much--
likely, but not as much.

00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:53.000
Labor force participation
rates have really changed.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.320
Men have been going
down since the 1950s.

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:56.890
Women obviously went up.

00:32:56.890 --> 00:32:59.110
But then women have
also been teetering down

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:01.050
since around 2000.

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:04.220
Some of the reasons for men's
decreasing participation rate

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:05.370
are really good.

00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:07.730
Men are staying
in school longer.

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:10.690
They're taking time off to
take care of kids or travel.

00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:12.380
They are retiring.

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:17.260
In the 1950s, the typical man
died before the retirement age.

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:21.030
Now, the typical man
lives past retirement age.

00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:21.810
Big difference.

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:23.601
Affects the labor force
participation rate.

00:33:23.601 --> 00:33:26.170
This is good.

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:28.060
And they're often in
reasonably good health

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:29.890
if they are well-educated.

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:32.300
Less educated men,
however, suffer

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:35.090
from very high levels of
unemployment, underemployment,

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:36.490
and incarceration.

00:33:36.490 --> 00:33:39.700
And they often retire
or leave the workforce

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:42.780
because they are in
ill health rather than

00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:45.160
because they're ready to
move on to something else.

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:48.150
So it's a very
different demographic.

00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:49.740
Here's another.

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:53.150
If you look at percent of
births to unmarried women, which

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:57.440
is getting a lot of conversation
these years, if you look

00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:00.260
at groups of women who
did not go to college

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:03.210
or had some college, there
are real racial differences.

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:05.320
But if you look at women
with a college degree,

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:08.650
those racial
differences disappear.

00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:11.070
At this point, black
and Hispanic women

00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:14.460
have basically the same
birthrate, whether or not

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:15.270
they are married.

00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:17.750
For white women,
there's a difference.

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:19.280
But again, among
college graduates,

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:20.363
the differences disappear.

00:34:22.659 --> 00:34:27.530
Here's looking at those who
have never married by age 40.

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:30.050
And as you can see, there's
huge differences based

00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:32.929
on race, gender, and education.

00:34:32.929 --> 00:34:35.030
For black men without
a high school diploma,

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:37.770
it's well less than half
will ever marry by age 40,

00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:40.190
which probably means ever.

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:42.690
2/3 of Americans
say that a man has

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:45.699
to be able to support a
family before he gets married.

00:34:45.699 --> 00:34:48.360
1/3 of Americans think
the same for women.

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:51.940
So that's part of what drives
this gender difference.

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:54.010
Obviously lots more that
could be said there.

00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:59.120
But this is a graph of the
ages of people when they marry.

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:02.700
And as you can see, back at
the turn of the 20th century,

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:10.540
it was really that gender
affected this a lot.

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:13.400
And now race affects it more.

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:16.110
There's been a shift
in what drives this,

00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:18.800
what fundamentally drives this.

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:21.560
And this is, again,
related to these ideas

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:25.390
about financial stability, that
nowadays most people feel--

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:29.580
and this is all ages,
all genders, all race

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:32.410
and economic groups,
educational groups--

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:35.280
feel that they need to get some
sense of financial stability

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.280
before they get married.

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:39.290
They need to get themselves
established professionally

00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:41.010
is what the college
graduates call it,

00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:44.160
just some financial
stability for folks who don't

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:46.656
have a professional aspiration.

00:35:46.656 --> 00:35:48.980
And in communities
where many men never

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:52.450
achieve financial stability,
they don't get married.

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:55.070
But most people want to
have children in their 20s

00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:59.360
when it really works
well to have children.

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.770
And women in their
20s are often saying,

00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:05.250
I can handle raising a kid
or two-- and most of them

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:07.860
have a kid or two,
not lots-- but I

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:11.790
can't take on being financially
responsible for a man as well.

00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:16.315
So we have huge
patterns going on here.

00:36:16.315 --> 00:36:17.690
So that gives you
a flavor what I

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:21.340
mean when I say that
education is really affecting

00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:24.400
our country more than it was.

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:27.840
Where is gender inequality
head is my final question.

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:30.370
There are sort of different
possible answers to this,

00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:32.990
and I don't-- I'm not
coming down on any one side.

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:36.320
But one theory is
that gender equality

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:38.319
will continue to increase
in the United States.

00:36:38.319 --> 00:36:40.110
So we have a lot of
positive feedback loops

00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:41.580
that are just going
to keep going.

00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:43.810
Knowledge-based economy.

00:36:43.810 --> 00:36:45.920
2/3 of women and
nearly half of men

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:48.440
say they believe in the
social, economic, and political

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:50.330
equality of the sexes.

00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:52.330
Roughly half of those
people describe themselves

00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:54.030
as feminists, the
other half don't.

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:56.840
But you know, they still believe
in equality of the genders,

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:58.190
so, you know.

00:36:58.190 --> 00:37:01.090
Laws-- not always
followed, but laws

00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:05.390
prohibit gender discrimination
and they enforce, say

00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:07.390
that women have a right
to refuse sex and use

00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:09.940
contraception, at least so far.

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:12.752
And social tolerance
of violence,

00:37:12.752 --> 00:37:15.210
particularly sexual violence,
is decreasing, has decreased,

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:17.670
and seems to be
continuing to decrease.

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:20.710
So all of those factors
suggest that gender equality

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:23.500
will continue to increase.

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:27.174
Globally, nearly all big
international institutions,

00:37:27.174 --> 00:37:28.590
governments-- not
all governments,

00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:31.160
but many governments--
have realized

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:34.480
that increasing gender equality
and women's empowerment

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:38.390
seems to be key to
creating stable societies

00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:41.630
with prosperity, with economic
stability, good economies, lack

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:42.130
of violence.

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:44.130
All of this seems
to be intertwined.

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:46.240
I'm not saying anything
radically new here.

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:48.570
World Bank will say it, too.

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:50.640
And many poor and
middle income countries

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:55.410
have started a positive cycle
of more education, more women's

00:37:55.410 --> 00:37:58.225
employment, increasing
health, women's empowerment.

00:37:58.225 --> 00:38:01.470
These are things-- again,
positive feedback cycles

00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:03.871
going in a good direction.

00:38:03.871 --> 00:38:06.100
There are theories, however,
that gender equality

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:07.570
will stagnate.

00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:10.660
As I said, in the US
metrics have stagnated since

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:12.200
around 2000.

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:14.280
Women still have
primary responsibility

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:16.920
for unpaid family
work everywhere, even

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:19.156
in the most egalitarian
countries, like Sweden,

00:38:19.156 --> 00:38:20.030
the Nordic countries.

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:22.600
They're working on it,
but it's still really

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:25.340
women's ultimate responsibility
for their families.

00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:30.000
And for less lucky and
prosperous countries,

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.050
ethnic groups that are
marginalized or stigmatized,

00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:35.850
or live in war zones, often
have really high levels

00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:38.060
of gender inequality, along
with all the other things

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:38.880
they are suffering.

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:41.250
And it's really hard
to break those cycles

00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:46.730
for stigmatized or
violence-prone areas.

00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:51.560
So, theories that gender
inequality will increase.

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:56.220
Societies tend to become more
stagnant and more intolerant

00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:59.830
and more full of resentment
when an economic situation is

00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:01.424
either level or falling.

00:39:01.424 --> 00:39:03.340
When people have a falling
standard of living,

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:06.720
they often feel that they
need to find someone to blame.

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:08.930
And this can intersect
with masculinity,

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:11.560
that if a man feels like
it's his responsibility

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:13.920
to be a breadwinner
and to be, therefore,

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:15.770
in control of his
family, and he can't

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:18.970
do that, men can
become very resentful.

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:22.090
And some men try to shore up
their sense of masculinity

00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:24.610
by exercising it in
other ways, i.e.,

00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:27.220
dominating women and
dominating children.

00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:29.470
So that is a pattern
that has been seen

00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:30.730
in many different contexts.

00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:33.310
If the United States
is headed into a period

00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:35.990
of economic decline, or some
people in the United States

00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:38.230
are headed into a long
period of economic decline,

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:42.960
this pattern has its obvious
risks-- and other countries

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:44.830
as well, not just
the United States.

00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:48.360
And then, women tend
to suffer more than men

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:50.780
from political and
economic instability

00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:51.989
from social disorder and war.

00:39:51.989 --> 00:39:53.988
Children suffer the most,
right, because they're

00:39:53.988 --> 00:39:54.920
the most vulnerable.

00:39:54.920 --> 00:40:00.090
But the more a woman has to work
to keep her family alive just

00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:04.960
subsisting, the lesser
she has for anything else.

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:09.110
And climate change and
environmental stresses,

00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:11.840
economic stresses, look
like they are increasing.

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:14.434
The Pentagon has
put out research

00:40:14.434 --> 00:40:16.350
suggesting that there's
going to be increasing

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:18.760
economic instability,
political instability,

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:20.410
and military
instability worldwide.

00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:21.860
So they're preparing for that.

00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:25.160
Again, I don't know if that's
what's going to happen,

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:26.700
but it certainly
is a possibility

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:29.580
that environmental stresses will
lead to more social stresses,

00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:34.040
will lead to more gender
inequality in countries

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:37.640
where those cycles
can actually reverse.

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:42.348
So thank you very
much for listening.

00:40:42.348 --> 00:40:46.140
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:49.130
Questions?

00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:50.610
Comments?

00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:55.620
AUDIENCE: So the part where
women are graduating college

00:40:55.620 --> 00:41:01.202
now more than men, how does
that track by class and race?

00:41:01.202 --> 00:41:06.020
LORI KENSCHAFT: It's
more true for families

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:07.780
where the parents did
not go to college.

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:11.480
So in elite families, it's very
likely that all of the children

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:13.010
will go to college
no matter what.

00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:14.420
Small exceptions not.

00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:17.150
But families where some people
go to college and some people

00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:19.550
not, that's where you
really see the differences,

00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:21.810
that girls are
more likely to go.

00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:24.740
And one of the reasons
for that, it is believed,

00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:29.760
is gender discrimination
in the workforce.

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:34.370
That, at any given level of
education, the boy or young man

00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:37.850
is more likely to get a
job and a better paid job

00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:39.190
than the woman at that level.

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:41.450
So women have to get
more education in order

00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:43.170
to get economic equality.

00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:45.880
And then on top of that,
women see themselves

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:47.980
as having primary
responsibility for children.

00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:50.100
So they really want to
get economic stability.

00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:53.880
So there's gender issues
driving the motivations

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:57.360
in families that are less
elite, less privileged.

00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:59.430
AUDIENCE: When you
talked about factors

00:41:59.430 --> 00:42:02.360
that affect a family's decision
about whether to support

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:05.500
their daughters going to
school, you mostly talked

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:08.240
about factors that were
internal to the family,

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:11.310
the economic situation
or the attitudes

00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:13.830
towards the girls' education.

00:42:13.830 --> 00:42:17.300
One of the things that's been
surprising watching the world

00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:19.290
news, at least for me
over the last decade,

00:42:19.290 --> 00:42:22.500
is the growth of the
belief of a political,

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:26.854
cultural-- that I have the
right to tell other families not

00:42:26.854 --> 00:42:28.270
to send their
daughters to school,

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:33.630
that that's seen as a major
political plank of a group

00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:36.550
like Boko Haram or in Pakistan.

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:42.120
And I was curious
whether you see that

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:45.180
as being the outgrowth
of economic factors,

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:48.720
or is this something that also
could play into, unfortunately,

00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:50.990
one of those last three slides?

00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:52.750
LORI KENSCHAFT: Absolutely.

00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:54.500
The real answer is
very complicated,

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.200
as you can imagine.

00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:57.530
And I glossed over it.

00:42:57.530 --> 00:42:59.880
But that safety
issue, that a lot

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:03.740
of how the Taliban, Boko
Haram, other extremist groups

00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:07.550
have deterred parents from
sending their kids to school,

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:10.275
particularly their daughters,
is by making schools

00:43:10.275 --> 00:43:12.400
seem threatening, that
there may be violence there.

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.100
There isn't violence
all the time, obviously.

00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:15.641
But if you're scared
that your kid is

00:43:15.641 --> 00:43:18.730
going to get attacked, raped,
killed for going to school,

00:43:18.730 --> 00:43:21.470
you're less likely to
send them to school.

00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:26.120
And you know, Boko
Haram literally

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:29.910
means Western knowledge or
Western education is forbidden,

00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:31.160
or is taboo.

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:34.100
And I see those movements
as very much part

00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:40.500
of a reaction against Western
ideology, Western colonization.

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:45.750
And I'm not justifying it
there, but saying, yes,

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:49.620
there is a global debate
that's going on now.

00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:53.320
And one of the places it's
playing out is on this dispute

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:56.520
on who should have control
over people's bodies,

00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:58.440
particularly girls'
and women's bodies.

00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:00.560
Should it be the
family and community,

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:02.650
as it was in
traditional societies,

00:44:02.650 --> 00:44:04.690
or should it be the individual?

00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:07.470
Most of the world sees the
United States and Europe

00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:11.670
as saying individuals should
have control over their bodies,

00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:15.370
over their destinies, over how
they dress, how they behave.

00:44:15.370 --> 00:44:19.530
And the men of Boko
Haram and the Taliban

00:44:19.530 --> 00:44:23.500
see that as a real
threat to them as men,

00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:26.340
but also to their whole
traditional society

00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:29.700
that's based on
the group defining

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:31.210
what individuals will do.

00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:35.060
So gender is one of the places
that this fundamental argument

00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:40.870
over where the locus of control
should be is playing out.

00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:41.510
Does that help?

00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:42.776
AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:44:42.776 --> 00:44:49.120
AUDIENCE: So how do you imagine
the impact of the birth gender,

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:53.590
sex inequality in 15, 20
years in China, in India,

00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:56.390
or in Africa?

00:44:56.390 --> 00:45:00.020
Now that those kids are
maturing into adults,

00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:03.340
but the gender
equality is all off.

00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:06.040
LORI KENSCHAFT:
Thank you for asking.

00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:07.330
It's not just in the future.

00:45:07.330 --> 00:45:08.830
It's happening now,
because this has

00:45:08.830 --> 00:45:12.800
been going on as long as people
have had access to ultrasounds.

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:14.560
And that's young adults now.

00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:17.140
And so particularly in
China, India, Vietnam,

00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:20.660
a few other places, you
have really big disparities.

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:23.870
And there's real concerns
about the militarization that

00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:27.010
happens when a society has
too many men, that they

00:45:27.010 --> 00:45:28.000
need young men.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.590
Young men who can't
settle into a family

00:45:30.590 --> 00:45:35.130
are often pretty hard to
control, and particularly

00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:38.000
in societies where the
sense of membership,

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.720
the sense of belonging, is
still very strongly rooted

00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:42.920
in families.

00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:44.960
China, as I said, is
changing very quickly.

00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:47.168
And that's partly because
of the ideological changes.

00:45:47.168 --> 00:45:50.510
It's partly because of
the economic changes

00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:52.835
driven by industrialization.

00:45:52.835 --> 00:45:55.210
But it isn't like a society
changes instantaneously

00:45:55.210 --> 00:45:56.040
overnight.

00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:59.870
And so young men
in China now know

00:45:59.870 --> 00:46:03.180
that they have really hard
odds around getting married.

00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:06.080
The elite ones are going to,
but the less elite ones are not.

00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:08.660
Same thing in India,
where one of the things

00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:11.460
we talk about in the
book is issues of rape.

00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:13.780
And we focus on India
and the United States.

00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:15.530
But there are a lot
of young men in India,

00:46:15.530 --> 00:46:17.990
lower status young men, who
know that they're never going

00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:19.570
to be able to afford to marry.

00:46:19.570 --> 00:46:23.230
And in a society where marriage
is how you get your value out

00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:24.950
of life, that can
be devastating.

00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:28.620
So yes, this is already rippling
through these societies.

00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:32.340
The key thing that I'm going
to take the opportunity to add

00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:34.670
is that South Korea
used to be in this camp,

00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:37.480
and among adults, it still is.

00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:40.200
But if you go back
and look at the graph,

00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:43.730
now there's some sex-selective
abortion going on

00:46:43.730 --> 00:46:45.640
in South Korea, but
not nearly as much,

00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:47.500
not enough to show
up on the map.

00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:49.590
And the reason for
that, it seems,

00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:52.590
is partly ideological--
preaching about gender equality

00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:54.720
and all of that-- but
even more, the country

00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:59.660
put in a strong public pension
service for older adults.

00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:01.850
Because in traditional
societies, when you get old,

00:47:01.850 --> 00:47:04.410
you need to rely on your
children to keep you alive.

00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:06.530
And in traditional
societies where only males

00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:09.345
can have access to good jobs
and ownership of property,

00:47:09.345 --> 00:47:10.720
that means you
need to have sons,

00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:12.210
or you're going to be destitute.

00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:17.450
And South Korea got access to
ultrasounds and good, simple

00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:20.910
abortion technology at a stage
where parents still depended

00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:23.220
on their sons to survive.

00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:24.770
Industrialized
societies, people tend

00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:27.080
to want to have one, two,
maybe three children.

00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:28.120
Sometimes zero.

00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:30.900
And so they were using
sex-selective abortion

00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:33.340
to make sure they'd be
secure in their old age.

00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:37.160
Once the country started
putting in equivalent to social

00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:40.110
security, the use of
sex-selective abortion

00:47:40.110 --> 00:47:41.260
went down a lot.

00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:42.380
That works.

00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:43.840
Making it illegal doesn't work.

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:44.800
It's illegal in China.

00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:46.260
It's illegal in India.

00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:47.680
It's happening.

00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:49.180
So that's the key thing there.

00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:52.324
And yes, those societies
are consciously

00:47:52.324 --> 00:47:54.365
and intentionally struggling
with these problems.

00:47:54.365 --> 00:47:56.240
AUDIENCE: And do
you think that would

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:58.915
lead to more gender
inequality, or to greater

00:47:58.915 --> 00:48:00.090
valuation of women?

00:48:00.090 --> 00:48:02.880
LORI KENSCHAFT: It can lead to
a greater valuation of women

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:06.110
as sexual and reproductive
partners, which

00:48:06.110 --> 00:48:10.110
tends to lead to more gender
inequality in the broader

00:48:10.110 --> 00:48:12.240
political and economic realm.

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:14.940
China has had an
increase in what's

00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:19.050
called wife theft, or wife
capture, where you grab a woman

00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:24.110
and go marry her whether or
not she was already married.

00:48:24.110 --> 00:48:27.340
That's an extreme form
of gender inequality--

00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:29.290
whether or not she
consents, obviously,

00:48:29.290 --> 00:48:31.130
if it's by physical capture.

00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:32.650
And that's not
happening everywhere,

00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:34.872
but that is one of
the patterns that's

00:48:34.872 --> 00:48:37.080
emblematic of what happens
when there's a real gender

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:41.010
imbalance, that women get valued
as sexual and reproductive

00:48:41.010 --> 00:48:42.330
objects.

00:48:42.330 --> 00:48:44.330
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank
you so much for coming.

00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:47.721
