which would fulfill the generalization I

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:28.190
which would fulfill the generalization I
 

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:31.900
which would fulfill the generalization I
make that people I guess our type of

so many different things maybe more
 

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:50.440
so many different things maybe more
diversified but it isn't as if they're

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:50.450
diversified but it isn't as if they're

lot of people walking is probably the
 

01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:25.860
lot of people walking is probably the
most important thing but there are other

01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:25.870
most important thing but there are other
 

01:07:25.870 --> 01:07:27.660

amount of weight lifting muscles you
know left unused will deteriorate much

01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:34.270
know left unused will deteriorate much
 

01:07:34.270 --> 01:07:36.930
