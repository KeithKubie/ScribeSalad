00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.290
The function in the last video
is used to report the mean and

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.560
the standard error.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.990
Suppose I wanted to also
report a 95% confidence

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.990
interval for the mean?

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.500
Here I'll construct a
confidence interval.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.980
The qt function is used to
identify the 97.5 quantile of

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.700
the T-distribution with n minus
1 degrees of freedom.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.140
There might be some temptation
to concatenate the confidence

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.660
interval with the current
results being reported from

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.830
the function.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.650
In some instances, this might
be fine, but it isn't a very

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.980
clear way to organize
the results.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.690
For example, what if another
user mistakenly thought the

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.860
first two values were the
confidence interval and the

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.240
last two were the mean and
the standard error?

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.970
That could be disastrous.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.660
When multiple objects are
being returned from a

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.810
function, it's usually helpful
to return them in a list.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.060
But even now, things might still
be a little bit unclear.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.580
For this reason, it's useful to
add names to each element

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.700
of the list.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.480
And before I forget,
I should update

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.820
the name of the function.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.350
I'm going to name it GetCI for
Get Confidence Interval.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.560
There's one more change I want
to make before moving on--

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.740
making the function slightly
more general by allowing for a

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.860
different confidence level.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.800
I'm going to do this using the
second argument called level.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.100
Since the 95% confidence level
is so commonly used, I'll

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.090
specify a 0.95 confidence
level as the default.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.300
Next, I need to make some slight
adjustments to the body

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.810
of the function to make use
of this new argument.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.330
I can compute the upper
percentile for the confidence

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:39.450
interval, then provide this
as a substitute for 0.975.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.840
Now I can run the function
without specifying a level to

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.260
get a standard 95%
confidence level.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.260
Or if I want a different
confidence level, say, 99%, I

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.510
can easily make that request.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.650
Suppose the user input a value
for a level of 99 rather than

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.070
0.99 for the level argument.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.570
In this application, it would be
nice if the function failed

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.530
elegantly and communicated why
there was an error rather than

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.980
simply reporting warning.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.370
This will be the top
of the next video.
