00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.100
I can drive FIFTY FIIIIIIIVE!!

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.100
Because it's more efficient.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.149
And safer!

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:09.059
Right?

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.139
Hey grandma drivers, this is big rig sciencepappy
Trace for DNews, what's your 20?

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.310
Old cars and highways often have a speed limit
of 55 because of efficiency.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.430
It all started in 1973, when the U.S. was
under an oil embargo.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.699
To conserve resources, Congress tied the state
speed limits to federal highway funding; basically

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.790
forcing states to adhere to 55 or else they'd
lose millions in highway money.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:40.990
They picked 55 because the Argonne National
Laboratory found that was the speed most cars

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.140
would get the best miles-per-gallon.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.650
Once the embargo ended, Congress was reluctant
to lift the limit, until 1995.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.450
Afterward, States went on a tizzy trying to
pick new speed limits.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.740
Most chose 70, but some use 65 or 80 (yes,
Texas, I know, you got a lil' bit of 85, you

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.150
get a cookie)!

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.410
But how did they decide on those numbers?

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.440
Well, firstly, exceeding the speed limit or
driving too fast for the conditions is the

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.730
primary cause of auto crashes globally.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.820
Which is why we have speed limits in the first
place.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.170
But it's important to know "too fast for conditions"
is a big deal.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.970
Because speed limits are determined by data,
but the data is from three main things: nature,

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.630
engineering, and humans!

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.100
For example: when highway and traffic researchers
decide a speed limit they take into account

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.120
weather, visibility, terrain, location and
so on -- nature.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.270
They also take into account the purpose of
the road, crash risks, traffic and truck flow

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.690
monitors (those two rubber tubes you sometimes
run over on the road), what the road is made

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.640
of, the amount of shoulder next to the road,
maintenance schedules -- that's engineering.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.340
And of course how humans actually USE the
road which we'll come back to in a sec.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.240
They then take that data and use different
computer and cost-based models to specifically

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.160
pick the speed for that stretch of road!

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.510
The human component has to do with safety,
but ALSO our ability to actually DRIVE on

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:07.780
that road at that speed.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.460
The operating speed model is often used, sort
of crowdsources the speed limit using something

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.370
called the "85th percentile rule."

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.793
Basically, researchers observe the average
speed people naturally want to use on a stretch

00:02:20.793 --> 00:02:23.240
of road, and lob off the speediest 15 percent!

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.510
Research has shown, that the 85th percentile
is a speed most people would be comfortable

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.510
driving.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.450
Which is super important, because be it 55
or 85 the researchers and lawmakers want a

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.670
speed limit that is "accepted as reasonable
by a majority of road users."

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.980
So, nature, engineering and humans together
factor into our speed limits.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.170
And that all kind of makes sense.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.520
Faster speeds tend toward stretches of road
in Montana or Texas, where roads are open,

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.540
sparsely populated and straight, while dense,
high-traffic, urban areas with more weather

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.050
considerations tend toward slower speeds.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.050
Duh, right?

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.430
Speed limits are human things, but they're
based on physics plus biology.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.610
Faster speeds means less time for our animal
brains to react when something goes wrong.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.770
According to the European Road Safety Observatory:
for every 1 km/h increase in speed there's

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.840
a 3 percent increase in crashes.It's an old
joke that it's not the crash that kills you,

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.180
but the sudden stop at the end.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.500
The faster you are going, the data says, the
more kinetic energy is in the vehicle, and

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.349
the worse the crash is going to be.

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:30.570
This is why some regions likely have lower
speed limits for their conditions, roads and

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:31.570
drivers.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.220
Once the speeds are picked, researchers are
constantly going back and adding new data

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.500
and testing the road at various speeds, and
in various conditions.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.959
Look, everyone who drives a car wants to get
where they're going as efficiently, quickly,

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.920
and safely as possible, even traffic researchers!

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.170
Every road, and every type of road is different!

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.910
The reason that speed limit is on THAT road,
is a mix of lots of data, and lots of human

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:54.910
effort.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.489

It also takes a lot of effort to keep your

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:57.489
car clean.

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:02.010
Techron by Chevronâ€™s patented Precision
Clean Technology targets and removes deposits

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.810
left by lower tier gasolines.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.800
It bonds with and breaks apart carbon deposits,
more effectively than other additive technologies.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.819
Techron gets into the deepest parts of the
engine, where the most destructive deposits

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.630
built up, and sweeps them away.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.410
But what about self-driving cars?

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.039
Should they have speed limits too?

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:18.100
Are they even safer?

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.710
Trace looks int-- wait a minute, I'm TRACE!

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.909
It's a good video, check it out. :D

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:32.629
What do you think?

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:33.629
Should speed limits be higher?

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:34.629
Lower?

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:40.360
Are you just waiting for the self-driving
revolution?

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.539
Tell me about it!
