00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.390
- [Kim] Hi, this is Kim from Khan Academy.

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:04.900
Today we're learning more
about the Ninth Amendment

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.107
to the US Constitution, which reads,

00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:10.717
"The enumeration in the
Constitution, of certain rights,

00:00:10.717 --> 00:00:13.717
"shall not be construed
to deny or disparage

00:00:13.717 --> 00:00:15.910
"others retained by the people."

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.160
This, along with the Tenth Amendment,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.150
doesn't protect a specific right,

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.572
like freedom of religion or
due process under the law,

00:00:23.572 --> 00:00:26.670
but rather, advances an interpretation

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.040
of the scope of the Constitution
and of government power.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.700
To learn more about the Ninth Amendment,

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.420
I talked with two experts.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.380
Kurt Lash is the E. Claiborne Robins

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.440
Distinguished Chair in Law

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.140
at the University of
Richmond School of Law.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.810
Jeffrey Rosen is the president and CEO

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.750
of the National Constitution Center.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.390
He has written extensively

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.250
on the history of the Supreme Court.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.010
Professor Lash, can you
tell us a little bit more

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.960
about this amendment?

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.970
Why did the Framers include this amendment

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.280
in the first place?

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.560
- [Kurt] The Ninth Amendment,

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.850
like rest of the Bill of Rights,

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.056
was added at the insistence of the states.

00:01:02.056 --> 00:01:04.580
Although the advocates of
the proposed Constitution

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.837
had claimed that the national government

00:01:05.837 --> 00:01:09.280
would have only limited enumerated power,

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.760
the state ratifying
conventions wanted that promise

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.690
put in writing.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.090
- [Jeffrey] Originally, the Constitution

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.810
didn't contain a bill of rights

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.810
'cause James Madison said a bill of rights

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.620
would be unnecessary or dangerous,

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.530
unnecessary 'cause the Constitution itself

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.363
was a bill of rights.

00:01:23.363 --> 00:01:25.630
It only granted Congress limited powers,

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.470
and therefore, Congress had no power

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.400
to infringe free speech, for
example, or religious liberty,

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.600
and therefore, wouldn't be able to do so,

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.040
and dangerous, Madison said,

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.550
because if you had a bill of rights,

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:36.910
people might wrongly assume

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.250
that if a right wasn't written down,

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.690
it wasn't protected, but in response

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.510
to objections by anti-federalists,

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.340
that is those opposed to the ratification

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.290
of the Constitution, led by
George Mason of Virginia,

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.790
as well as Edmund Randolph of Virginia

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.230
and Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts,

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.271
so those three guys said, "Hey,

00:01:57.271 --> 00:01:59.747
"unless we include a bill of rights

00:01:59.747 --> 00:02:01.607
"for greater security and safety,

00:02:01.607 --> 00:02:04.720
"then we don't think the
Constitution should be ratified."

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.010
In response to their objections

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.700
and those in ratifying conventions,

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.580
many of which demanded a bill of rights,

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.018
Madison changed his mind, and he

00:02:12.018 --> 00:02:14.120
included a bill of rights,
which he cut-and-pasted

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.210
from revolutionary-era
state constitutions,

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.820
and viewers and listeners
can check those out

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.530
at the Interactive Constitution.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.210
Then that raised an interpretive problem.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.390
Madison and others were worried,

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.420
if you just had a limited
list of rights, 10

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.370
amendments in particular,
protecting particular rights,

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.600
people might assume that if
a right wasn't written down,

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.410
then it wasn't protected, and the Framers

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.410
didn't want you to reach that conclusion

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.100
because they believed that
our rights come from God

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.410
or nature and not from government.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.430
Thomas Jefferson, in the
Declaration of Independence,

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.130
said we're all endowed by our Creator

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.940
with certain unalienable rights.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.550
- [Kurt] When you look
at these amendments,

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.877
our first 10 amendments,

00:02:56.877 --> 00:02:59.750
you'll notice that some
address specific issues,

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.650
like speech and the right to bear arms.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.729
The last two amendments
on that list, however,

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:09.560
address broader issues of
Constitutional interpretation.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.550
These are rules of construction.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:13.990
The Tenth Amendment

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.618
declares that all powers
not delegated away

00:03:16.618 --> 00:03:19.990
remain under the control of
the people in the states.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.030
The Ninth Amendment addresses the problem

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.630
potentially raised by adding
this list in a bill of rights.

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.610
The Ninth Amendment tells
us that just because

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.840
the Constitution lists certain important

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.030
limitations on federal power,

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.880
this doesn't mean that
the federal government

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.240
has otherwise unlimited power,

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.007
or, as the Ninth Amendment puts it,

00:03:40.007 --> 00:03:43.237
"The enumeration in the
Constitution, of certain rights,

00:03:43.237 --> 00:03:45.607
"shall not be construed
to deny or disparage

00:03:45.607 --> 00:03:47.880
"others retained by the people."

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.681
In this way, those two
last rules of construction

00:03:50.681 --> 00:03:53.405
ensure that every subject not placed

00:03:53.405 --> 00:03:55.570
under the control of
the national government

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.940
would remain under the control
of the people in the states

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.320
and remain there as a matter of right.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.280
These amendments protect
the people's retained right

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.430
to local self government.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.270
- [Jeffrey] I talked a
bit about natural rights

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.180
because that same notion of the idea

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.010
that you retain natural rights

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.610
when you move from the state of nature

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.650
to the civil society is picked up

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.430
in the language of the Ninth Amendment,

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.847
which says that the
enumeration "of certain rights

00:04:21.847 --> 00:04:24.567
"shall not be construed to
deny or disparage others

00:04:24.567 --> 00:04:27.240
"retained by the people,"
so one big theory

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.410
of the Ninth Amendment is that it refers

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.184
to these natural rights
that come from God or nature

00:04:32.184 --> 00:04:34.700
and that you retain during the transition

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.083
from the state of nature to civil society.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.153
- [Kim] Can you give us a few examples

00:04:40.153 --> 00:04:42.450
of what those unenumerated rights

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.040
that people have debated have been?

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.110
- [Jeffrey] The paradigmatic source

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.087
for identifying what
unenumerated rights are protected

00:04:50.087 --> 00:04:53.050
is a case called Corfield v. Coryell.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.690
It was decided in the early 19th Century,

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.544
and it was cited repeatedly
by the people who wrote

00:04:58.544 --> 00:05:01.010
the Privileges or Immunities Clause

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.080
to the Fourteenth Amendment
to the Constitution,

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.730
and basically, the Privileges
or Immunities Clause says that

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.520
no state shall abridge the
privileges or immunities

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.070
of citizens of the United States,

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.260
and the question is what are
those privileges or immunities?

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.100
In trying to define them, John Bingham,

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.600
who wrote the Fourteenth Amendment,

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.480
and a lot of other people

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.327
said, "Well, some of the
privileges or immunities

00:05:23.327 --> 00:05:26.127
"include the rights written
down in the Bill of Rights,

00:05:26.127 --> 00:05:29.087
"but others are not written
down in the Bill of Rights,

00:05:29.087 --> 00:05:31.810
"and you can find them in the
Corfield and Coryell case.

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.050
They're rights that are fundamental.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.850
They're uniform from state to state,

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.038
and they've been considered basic rights

00:05:38.038 --> 00:05:40.160
of Americans from the beginning.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.840
Some of these rights
include the right to make

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.150
and enforce contracts, to sue and be sued,

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.390
to have basic economic rights,

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:52.170
and also to have the benefit
of the writ of habeas corpus,

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:53.665
which is in the original Constitution,

00:05:53.665 --> 00:05:56.040
and that's the right to
challenge the constitutionality

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.410
of your conviction.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:58.900
It's in the original Constitution,

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.640
but not in the Bill of Rights.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.990
Those are just some examples

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.857
of the unenumerated economic rights

00:06:04.857 --> 00:06:08.115
that the Framers of the
Fourteenth Amendment considered

00:06:08.115 --> 00:06:10.830
to be protected by the
Fourteenth Amendment

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.775
and by implication, by
the Ninth Amendment too,

00:06:12.775 --> 00:06:14.016
'cause they are natural rights,

00:06:14.016 --> 00:06:16.320
as we heard Roger Sherman
say, the basic rights

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.430
of acquiring and possessing property

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.690
and obtaining happiness and safety,

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:21.900
those are some of those rights.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.000
- [Kurt] The Ninth Amendment
raises the difficult issue

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.520
of how exactly you determine
what the rights are

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.490
that are actually retained by the people.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.017
The text of the Ninth Amendment itself

00:06:31.017 --> 00:06:33.900
tells us very little
about the specific content

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.240
of our retained rights, but
in fact, these retained rights

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.531
are as numerous as the stars in the sky.

00:06:39.531 --> 00:06:42.020
They include everything from wearing a hat

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.265
to walking on the sidewalk,
to purchasing life insurance,

00:06:46.265 --> 00:06:49.160
or determining where
you can park your car,

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.110
or what classes should be
offered in the local high school,

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.300
basically everything that
was never meant to be handed

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.709
to the control of the national
government, all of these

00:06:57.709 --> 00:06:59.750
are rights retained to the control

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.480
of the people in the several states,

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:05.230
and all of these rights will be protected

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:08.290
if you limit the scope of federal power.

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:10.940
A limited interpretation
of the Commerce Clause,

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.050
for example, preserves the
people's retained right

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.680
to establish local educational policy

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.813
and to pass all manner of
local civil rights legislation

00:07:19.813 --> 00:07:23.124
that's not expressly covered
by the federal Constitution.

00:07:23.124 --> 00:07:26.800
The greater the limits on federal power,

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.873
the greater the freedom
of local communities.

00:07:29.873 --> 00:07:34.873
By making a limited interpretation
of federal power a right,

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.110
this ensure the matter can
be litigated in federal court

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:40.570
and not just left to political compromise.

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:42.920
Over time, courts will
produce a body of law

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.030
that invalidates attempts
by the federal government

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:47.770
to regulate our lives in forbidden ways,

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.760
such as not having the power
under the Commerce Clause

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.780
to force us to purchase
private health insurance

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:57.410
or not having the power to
commandeer state official

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:01.040
and force them to enforce
federal immigration policy.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.520
- [Kim] Does this refer
back to some extent

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.631
to kind of the common law of England

00:08:05.631 --> 00:08:08.120
and the things that were considered

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.470
the natural rights of Englishmen?

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:13.450
- [Jeffrey] Yes, it does,
although we should distinguish it

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:16.160
if we're gonna be
precise, which we should.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.510
Not all of the common
law rights of Englishmen

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:19.960
were natural rights.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.510
Common law rights, basically, are rights

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:24.050
that were traditionally
protected by English law.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:25.580
They're rights that had been recognized

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:27.863
by English judges over centuries.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:32.598
Natural rights come from God
or nature, not from government.

00:08:32.598 --> 00:08:34.470
There's overlap between those groups,

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:37.130
but there might've been some
common law rights of English

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:39.940
people that were recognized by tradition,

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.200
like the right to jury trial, for example.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.030
That's not a natural
right 'cause there are no

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:45.480
juries in the state of nature.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.540
There are just people

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.890
who are (laughs) imagining
forming governments.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.800
It makes it a little tricky,
but it's actually not

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.140
that analytically tricky,
and it's so interesting

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.447
that over and over
again, the Framers said,

00:08:57.447 --> 00:08:59.657
"You know, this is just,
everyone knows what these

00:08:59.657 --> 00:09:00.640
"natural rights are."

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.200
They're the ones that are recognized

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.483
in Corfield and Coryell,

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:06.950
and then other enumerated rights

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:08.980
might include the common
law rights of Englishmen,

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:10.957
but it was a pretty short list,

00:09:10.957 --> 00:09:13.630
and the best way to just
figure out which rights

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:16.800
were natural, go to the
Interactive Constitution,

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.720
click down, and look at the
Virginia Declaration of Rights.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.150
Look at the Massachusetts
Constitution of 1780,

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:25.160
the New Hampshire Constitution.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.610
It has this beautiful preamble

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:27.980
about what a natural right is,

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.150
and you'll just see that all
of these state constitutions

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.700
are recognizing the same natural
rights over and over again.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.840
- [Kim] Has the Supreme
Court ever decided a case

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.370
based on the Ninth Amendment?

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:39.810
- [Kurt] The first judicial opinion

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:42.980
was actually written by
Justice Joseph Story,

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.970
one of the most famous
justices in American history.

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:48.180
In his opinion in Houston Against Moore,

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:51.502
decided in 1820, Story
explained that the spirit

00:09:51.502 --> 00:09:53.770
and letter of the Ninth Amendment

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:55.740
called for the limited interpreting

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.610
of the scope of federal power

00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:00.090
in order to avoid
interfering with state laws

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:01.820
regarding the local militia.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:05.640
In fact, it wasn't until the 20th Century

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.540
that you find scholars and justices

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.464
trying to invert the Ninth Amendment

00:10:10.464 --> 00:10:12.990
in a manner that allowed or even required

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:15.610
federal interference with local policies.

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:18.010
In Griswold against
Connecticut, for example,

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:19.760
Justice Arthur Goldberg argued

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.840
that the Ninth Amendment
supported the court's

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.360
invalidation of state contraception laws.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.230
- [Jeffrey] Douglas says in
this case that the Constitution

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:31.170
and the particular rights
and the Bill of Rights

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:34.610
include certain penumbras
formed be emanations,

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:37.273
from the particular
guarantees that may create

00:10:37.273 --> 00:10:41.010
broader unenumerated rights,
and privacy was one of them.

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:44.100
Douglas says privacy is
protected in different ways

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.270
in different parts of the Bill of Rights.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:47.510
The Fourth Amendment
protects our right against

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:49.410
unreasonable searches and seizures.

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:51.120
The Third Amendment protects the right

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.690
not to have soldiers
quartered in the home.

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:54.125
The First Amendment protects

00:10:54.125 --> 00:10:56.210
a right of freedom of association,

00:10:56.210 --> 00:11:00.230
and from these particular
expressions of privacy,

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:02.730
Douglas extracted, or inferred,

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:05.510
a broader and more
sweeping right of privacy,

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:07.610
which could be extended to cover

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:09.860
a married couple's right
to use contraception.

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.790
- [Kim] When the Bill
of Rights was ratified

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:16.830
in the late 18th Century, it only applied

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:18.416
to the federal government.

00:11:18.416 --> 00:11:20.679
It was not until after the Civil War,

00:11:20.679 --> 00:11:24.400
in the late 1860s and early 1870s,

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.750
that the Fourteenth Amendment applied some

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:30.508
of the protections of the Bill of Rights

00:11:30.508 --> 00:11:32.694
to state governments.

00:11:32.694 --> 00:11:35.110
How does the Fourteenth Amendment

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:38.220
impact our understanding
of the Ninth Amendment?

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:40.283
- [Kurt] Most Constitutional
historians believe

00:11:40.283 --> 00:11:43.180
that the Privileges or Immunities Clause

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:44.980
was originally understood as applying

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.961
the first eight amendments
against the states.

00:11:47.961 --> 00:11:49.790
What of the Ninth Amendment?

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:51.260
Is it possible

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.330
that the Privileges or Immunities Clause

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.400
turns the Ninth Amendment from a provision

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.844
protecting local government to one

00:11:57.844 --> 00:12:00.930
that interferes with local government?

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:03.164
Many libertarian scholars believe so.

00:12:03.164 --> 00:12:05.610
A close look at the
historical record, however,

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:08.090
shows that this is not likely.

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:11.000
To begin with, John
Bingham, the man who framed

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.160
the Privileges or Immunities Clause,

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.250
publicly declared at the
House of Representatives

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:17.130
that the Privileges or Immunities Clause

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:18.760
made the first eight amendments

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.690
enforceable against the states.

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:24.040
He said nothing about either
the Ninth or Tenth Amendments.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.370
Meanwhile, in the Senate,

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:27.160
the man who introduced the proposed

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.444
Fourteenth Amendment to
his college, Jacob Howard,

00:12:29.444 --> 00:12:32.720
also said that the Privileges
or Immunities Clause

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.280
would apply the first eight
amendments against the states,

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:39.690
and he too said nothing about
the Ninth or Tenth Amendments.

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:42.670
Finally, the public that
debated and ratified

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:45.384
the Fourteenth Amendment
remained broadly committed

00:12:45.384 --> 00:12:47.759
to the federalist
principle of dividing power

00:12:47.759 --> 00:12:50.480
between the state and local governments.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.190
It had been the slave-holding rebel sates

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:54.790
that had violated this principle

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:58.320
by demanding that slavery be
enforced throughout the nation,

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.790
regardless of local freedom laws.

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:03.140
If we look at the period
in which they adopted

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:05.990
the Fourteenth Amendment, it
appears that that ammendment

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:08.400
did, in fact, apply the textual rights

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.000
of the first eight amendments
against the states,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.405
but it left everything
else to local control,

00:13:13.405 --> 00:13:16.272
subject only to the
requirements of due process

00:13:16.272 --> 00:13:17.863
and equal protection.

00:13:17.863 --> 00:13:19.470
- [Jeffrey] The Ninth
Amendment, at the very least,

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:21.500
is a question of interpretation.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.562
It says don't assume that if
a right isn't written down

00:13:24.562 --> 00:13:26.730
it's not protected.

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:28.990
When the late Robert
Bork, who was nominated

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:32.370
to the Supreme Court in
1987 but didn't get through,

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:34.910
said that the Ninth
Amendment should be treated

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:38.330
as an ink blot because we can't know

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:40.405
what rights are actually
protected by the Ninth Amendment,

00:13:40.405 --> 00:13:44.320
it should be ignored, that can't be right.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.200
That's the one thing that
Madison said don't do.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.950
Don't assume that if the
right isn't written down,

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:50.283
it's not protected.

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:55.310
Saying that that matter of construction

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:57.090
is important and that there are certain

00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:59.130
rights not enumerated in the Constitution

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:01.357
that are protected doesn't
tell us which rights

00:14:01.357 --> 00:14:03.388
are protected, and that's
where all of the action

00:14:03.388 --> 00:14:05.580
and all of the drama and
all of the excitement

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:07.090
and Constitutional interpretation

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:09.880
in the 20th and 21st
Century has come from.

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.300
How do we identify

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.760
the rights that are not written
down, are not enumerated,

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:15.790
but are protected?

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:17.360
There's a whole lot to say about that.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.090
In fact, that's why we
teach Constitutional law,

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:21.785
is to study the methodologies
of interpretation

00:14:21.785 --> 00:14:24.260
that lead people to different conclusions

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:28.010
about which unenumerated
rights are protected.

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:29.870
- [Kim] We've learned
that the Ninth Amendment

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:33.150
served as an assurance
that the Bill of Rights

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:35.520
was not an exhaustive list

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.690
of the rights retained by
the people or the states.

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:41.710
How can you protect unenumerated rights,

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:43.700
which, by their very definition,

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:46.060
aren't named in the Constitution?

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.030
Kurt Lash sees the original meaning

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:51.630
of the Ninth Amendment as a
restriction on federal power.

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:54.669
Jeff Rosen reminds us that
although it's difficult to tell

00:14:54.669 --> 00:14:57.000
which rights the Framers intended

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.690
to protect with the Ninth Amendment,

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:00.220
it's likely that those rights

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:02.746
included the same natural,
unalienable rights

00:15:02.746 --> 00:15:05.720
enshrined in the
Declaration of Independence.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.710
