1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,650
Top of the Stevia. I see. I just need
to superior to sugar in many ways. Yeah.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,720
It's not bad for you at all. Yeah.
Yeah. I don't think it didn't.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,930
The sugar lobby get fucking pretty pissed
about it. Yeah. They should get that.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,550
We should talk about this. Okay.
All right. That's good. Oh,

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:19,380
I say so many amazing things.
That's where you start doing a podcast.

6
00:00:19,381 --> 00:00:22,590
You start going, don't talk outside
of that. No Rogan experience.

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,793
Don't have it.

8
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:31,000
[inaudible]

9
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:43,030
the headphones that I have on [inaudible].

10
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:50,423
These are

11
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:59,210
why we made it to the end of the song.
Uh,

12
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,810
what the fuck people, oh,
is that your phone run?

13
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,490
No,
that's pacnet had Tom Chung.

14
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,530
Marcel always have this thing
going on where you're cuter.

15
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,780
We'll start playing things.
That's his playlist.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,820
My computer never just starts
playing shit out of nowhere.

17
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,050
What is your computer started
playing? Shit. It's on iTunes.

18
00:01:19,051 --> 00:01:24,000
It just goes to the next song. That's
your, that's your sexy time on iTunes.

19
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:27,970
It goes to the next song, right? Yeah. I
just play it so you just fucked up. Right.

20
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,650
Well that makes sense. Yeah. Ladies and
gentlemen, welcome to the pog drives.

21
00:01:31,651 --> 00:01:33,460
What's off? What's on
bedrooms? What's going on?

22
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,580
People working the fucking late chef,
people driving in the car,

23
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:38,400
people hating their life and needing
something to distract them from whatever

24
00:01:38,401 --> 00:01:41,610
bullshit you got yourself into right now.
It's going to get better.

25
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,560
Ladies and gentlemen, can I get better,
right Brian? Yes, rob, any better?

26
00:01:46,561 --> 00:01:49,350
But it can only get better if
you have a flashlight. Yes.

27
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,970
And we are sponsored by the flashlight.

28
00:01:50,971 --> 00:01:53,910
If you go to Joe rogan.net there's a link.
If you click the link,

29
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:57,450
you enter in the code name,
Rogan, you get 15% off. And I've,

30
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,780
I've humped them all in my
former Chris's fuck all of them.

31
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,470
There's so many combinations.
All of them done and they're great.

32
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,050
Which of which one's your favorite?
Mine's the Avatar, by the way.

33
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:11,820
I mean the alien aliens. Aliens. All
right. It's pretty good. But the,

34
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,660
for me it's the lotus because it's
confusing. It tricks me actually,

35
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,900
which will load at 6.0 the Lotus Lotus.
We designed,

36
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:22,250
I say we in the royal we sense,
cause you know I was Chris,

37
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,540
Chris Markus laser device.

38
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,120
Chris is our buddy and Chris used to work
for flashlight and he's also a writer

39
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:30,900
and just an all around cool cat and
entrepreneur out there in the world making

40
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:33,960
shit happen. Thank you Joe. So this
lotus then you help design this,

41
00:02:33,961 --> 00:02:37,040
modified that and I wanted
to try and recreate,

42
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,210
cause we do a good job with the exterior
of the vagina. Right. I want to do,

43
00:02:40,211 --> 00:02:42,280
which by the way is
completely unnecessary. Right.

44
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,790
You know I used to have a joke about that.

45
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,860
If you just put a round hole in the
wall we'll fuck. Right, right. Yeah.

46
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,390
It doesn't have to look like a fake
pussy. But the interior is key. Yes.

47
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,393
Sounds absolutely.

48
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,830
And wanting to try and create something
that was confusing and really actually

49
00:02:55,831 --> 00:02:56,880
felt as close as possible.

50
00:02:56,881 --> 00:03:00,010
And I think I did a decent job with the
loudest because it has this little note

51
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:00,970
in there that's kind of,
you know,

52
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:04,240
like when you're getting to the back
and you start to feel a little something

53
00:03:04,241 --> 00:03:07,300
that's coming in and giving you a little
pressure and you kind of slide around

54
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:09,460
it or something like that.
I don't exactly know how it works.

55
00:03:09,461 --> 00:03:13,090
Talking about the back of the vagina,
but there, but there's like a, yeah,

56
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,590
it's called watch.
You gotta be careful with those pitches.

57
00:03:16,591 --> 00:03:20,130
You just have speed bumps on the
bitch gives you go to a doctor,

58
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,940
get some shit cold laser.
It's like where the cauliflower,

59
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,180
where it starts feeling like
color flour. Right, right, right.

60
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:29,090
That's well I want some video
online ones. The g spot, by the way,

61
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,570
the board of stupid flowers. Is
that what it is? Yeah, really.

62
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,770
But every girl is different.
I mean you can't really say it's a g spot.

63
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,520
The cauliflower part is. Right, but you
know what I'm saying? I'm like every good,

64
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:41,860
there's certain spots. It's not every,
everybody doesn't have the same spot.

65
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,000
I always thought that's silly.

66
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,900
Like when you watch like push eating
competitions or a instructionals rather on

67
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:48,280
the Internet. You're seeing those, right?

68
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,290
I've seen a few of them is
in instructional. When you,

69
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,720
when you're eating out a girl
and you're like up at the top,

70
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:56,020
put that finger or two in and hit
the cauliflower, it just massage it.

71
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:59,820
While you're looking at instant orgasms,
you pull a Toro point towards the end,

72
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,390
almost pressure. You almost
[inaudible] motion come hither motion.

73
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,250
Every girl's got a different groove.
You know,

74
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:10,030
like some girls want you to just lock
on that motherfucker and go crazy really

75
00:04:10,031 --> 00:04:12,610
fast. Tom, some of the girls
like gentle, slow, gentle,

76
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:14,260
slow because they don't trust me.
They're cute.

77
00:04:14,261 --> 00:04:16,870
They're putting no trust in you when
you do that. I don't know if that's it.

78
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,010
I think it is.
I don't know if that's it.

79
00:04:18,011 --> 00:04:20,950
I think girls are levels desensitivity
yeah, the different shit.

80
00:04:20,951 --> 00:04:23,110
Some girls like it to blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

81
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,160
And other girls are, they just haven't
gone the other way. Same with nipples.

82
00:04:27,161 --> 00:04:29,170
I mean some girls, yeah,
whack them with a fly.

83
00:04:29,171 --> 00:04:32,220
Swatter girls will tell you to bite their
nipples by other girls. You touch them.

84
00:04:32,221 --> 00:04:33,041
They're like,
whoa.

85
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:37,540
Like it's an interesting thing with
some girls that it seems that pain has

86
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:41,050
become some sort of a sexual thing.
You know, it's not every girl,

87
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,730
but there are certain girls that pain for
whatever reason, turns him on, you know,

88
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,380
like they like to be manhandled
and choked and slapped and,

89
00:04:49,381 --> 00:04:52,930
and spanked and shit. And I like
to be fucked hardware. It hurts.

90
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,560
Like you look at them, you're like, you
know, it hurts face, but she's loving it.

91
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,090
You know what the fuck is.

92
00:04:58,091 --> 00:05:01,690
It has an evolutionary biological
advantage because I think, you know,

93
00:05:01,691 --> 00:05:05,980
sex back in the day was rough, brutish,
short, violent, you know, and you know,

94
00:05:05,981 --> 00:05:10,750
it just may way. That's how
I still rock. It made sense.

95
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,720
The girl that fucked the new school,
you know?

96
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:17,290
And actually when a girl obviously is
more excited, she's more open to actually,

97
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,390
she has a greater chance of conceiving.

98
00:05:19,391 --> 00:05:22,510
I've read about that in a book called
sperm wars, which is a great book. Yeah.

99
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,850
Let's see here. Moore's, I've heard. Okay.

100
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:28,290
I looked into all of this
because there was a, um, uh,

101
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:31,210
an article that I read a couple
articles I read about killer sperm,

102
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:35,790
that there are certain sperm that go
out and attack other sperm. So, um, I,

103
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:39,670
I read this on more than one source
online and from that book, sperm wars by,

104
00:05:39,671 --> 00:05:44,020
what's his name? Baker. Yeah.
I believe his name was Dr.
Baker. Um, so then I read,

105
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,100
um,
some,

106
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,640
some different responses to that and
apparently there's no evidence to support

107
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:51,790
it whatsoever. The only
evidence to support, um, that,

108
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:55,960
that there's like some sort of a,
a blocking system going on.

109
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,200
There's evidence to support that,

110
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,650
that there's always the why sperm is gooey
and sticky because one of the reasons

111
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:03,330
why I got up at work, it's trying to
clog up the works for other dudes. Yeah.

112
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,420
And there's also very strong
evidence that no matter the,

113
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,200
there's a direct correlation
between not just strong evidence,

114
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:13,130
but it's been proven between the
promiscuous nature of the females of the

115
00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:15,540
population and the size of the
testicles and the males. Yeah.

116
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,270
That the males just produce more sperm.

117
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,880
But that's just so they could shoot
more loads and have more chances.

118
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:23,840
It's not that there's actually sperm that
are going out there and killing other

119
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:28,070
spring. So that's sperm wars book
is a little warmth. Iffy, Huh? Yeah.

120
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:30,200
It's a little wonky.
But the uh,

121
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:32,900
the idea behind the woman
orgasming OpenAir up and making,

122
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:35,270
they're more likely to conceive
then you would think that,

123
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,200
well then the rape thing probably wouldn't
be the best thing. The best move. No,

124
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:43,180
but you know, if so, so how it
passes through sexual selection is,

125
00:06:43,181 --> 00:06:48,170
is the girl who actually
threw some genetic mutation
finds that attractive that

126
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:52,010
that kind of rough brute kind of rape
scenario attractive is going to produce

127
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:53,570
more stem, you know, vaginal fluid,

128
00:06:53,571 --> 00:06:57,350
which is going to help conduct the sperm
a little better and be more open to it.

129
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,480
So she's going to be
more likely to conceive,

130
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:04,190
meaning there'll be eventually over time
an advantage for the females who like

131
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,300
that kind of dominant scenario in
cultures that have dominant sex. Right.

132
00:07:08,301 --> 00:07:12,110
And they're also gonna be cohabitating
with dominant males in that way.

133
00:07:12,111 --> 00:07:14,750
You're going to have someone who's going
to protect you and get some shit done.

134
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,830
Yeah,
send us some week,

135
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:19,780
three quarter lymphatic dude's just barely
sticks in these squeezes out of slug

136
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,460
needs.
The split it with a popsicle stick.

137
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:25,310
Make your shitty genetic baby to go out
and get raped by a tyrannosaurus rex or

138
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:28,380
some shit. Right. All right, so you
were talking about the flashlight,

139
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,850
I that you were designing that.
Tell us how many designs there are.

140
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,880
The one you were designing the Lotus.
Yeah. So how many are there? Ah,

141
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
there's gotta be 1617 different
internals in the variations are different

142
00:07:41,091 --> 00:07:44,300
tightness. Like what is it a different
texture whenever you could think of,

143
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:44,780
I mean,

144
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:49,490
I mean it was really a matter of long
experience with feeling these things out

145
00:07:49,491 --> 00:07:51,050
and then you just come up with shit,
you know,

146
00:07:51,051 --> 00:07:54,290
like all this would be interesting and
you try it. You know, they build a rod,

147
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,860
try it out and some of them are smash
hits and some of them are like, man,

148
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:01,910
you know, does he ever started developing
some sort of a cleaning sponge thing?

149
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:06,590
Like a very small penis like sponge
that's attached to like sick of wire that

150
00:08:06,591 --> 00:08:08,420
comes swiffer. Yeah. Comes with

151
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:14,880
exactly something to get in there and
yeah. Well I mean so sticky inside anyway.

152
00:08:14,881 --> 00:08:15,220
It's like,

153
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:18,230
so the material is tough to come up
with something that would actually slide

154
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,510
that was poorest itself
that could actually clean.

155
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,400
Otherwise there'd be just like a,
you know,

156
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:26,780
a dildo hardness going ever been recorded.
Instance of a dude using a fleshlight,

157
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:28,310
having a venereal disease,

158
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:32,360
leaving his load and a flush and then
another sick fuck using the flashlight and

159
00:08:32,361 --> 00:08:36,050
getting that dude's disease. No, no,
no, no recorded. And that's possible.

160
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,100
How long will herpes last on the
plastic surface of the flashlight? Um,

161
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,640
that's a good question.
I don't know.

162
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,540
But we recommend Washington
them out every now and again.

163
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:51,620
Water would help. Well he's sharing it
with Joe that you might be worried about.

164
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:55,220
Just saying [inaudible] you have one,
it's all yours.

165
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,320
You don't need to share with us a kind
looking homeless guy down this track.

166
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,260
I don't want them to mind right
now. Bobby Lee, you me to share.

167
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,010
Bobby Lee was on our show last last
week and he's a huge supporter of the

168
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:09,620
vibrating one that has the
little rechargeable beads
right now. He said that,

169
00:09:09,621 --> 00:09:13,410
that he, they only last five minutes.
Does he have a defect one or no,

170
00:09:13,411 --> 00:09:15,990
the last 60 minutes. 60
minutes. So he has a defect.

171
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:20,950
Maybe he's just cause he's like
halfway through and stop rushes. Well,

172
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,790
you can handle, you just squeezes
it so hard against the side though.

173
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:26,990
Is that how it works? The harder you
squeeze it, the more Rev. Now I dunno.

174
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,790
I mean these things are, you know,
they have a little little engine,

175
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,440
little off centered little motor
in it and it lasts about, you know,

176
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,610
last about 60 minutes and B,
if you moved the boat,

177
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,730
move closer to the mic so that you all
have the same different volumes. Um,

178
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,310
and it fits right into the slot.
Yeah. So like every one of them,

179
00:09:44,311 --> 00:09:47,880
that little three slots in the head and
usually you can only fit one or two in

180
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:49,140
there, uh, with yourself.

181
00:09:49,141 --> 00:09:54,090
But we have three slots just in case and
just whoever's vibrates your Dick. Yeah,

182
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:57,810
I, you know, some people like it. I think
it's more distracting. I don't really,

183
00:09:57,811 --> 00:10:00,900
I'm not a big fan of the vibration. Yeah.
I don't be Lego's good. Where's the,

184
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,010
where is the fantasy cause
what am I fucking that girl
and what am I fine Gorana

185
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,140
washing machine. Fucking a robot, right.

186
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:11,550
On a washing machine in a hurricane or
during an earthquake. Yeah. There's some,

187
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,760
there's some really good products but
another company called screaming out and

188
00:10:14,761 --> 00:10:18,180
it's like are vibrating cock ring and
they've kind of taken that market,

189
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,190
which is awesome for the chicks.
But it's,

190
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:23,310
I find it kind of a little bit annoying
for me to have it on because the

191
00:10:23,311 --> 00:10:24,690
vibration is just distracting.

192
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,790
Like you feel less like imagine your
hand like on a massager and then try to

193
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,650
like feel something cool
propeller feel anything. Right.

194
00:10:31,651 --> 00:10:35,520
And then also what if like the CIC only
wants it with that vibrating contract.

195
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,040
You're like my cock and
balls and not enough. Right.

196
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:41,520
It has to turn yourself into a really
did annoy you man. Robo Cock. Yeah,

197
00:10:41,521 --> 00:10:45,340
because I dated a dude,
I dated the chick who dated,

198
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,520
dated a chick who dated a dude and they
had a bad relationship and one of the

199
00:10:50,521 --> 00:10:53,690
bad problems in their relationship with,
she got addicted to vibrators. Yep.

200
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,230
Very much addicted and really get it
girl that was addicted to it. Yeah. Did,

201
00:10:58,231 --> 00:10:59,400
it was first of all,

202
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:03,450
what's up with bitches telling you
like problems they had with other dudes

203
00:11:03,451 --> 00:11:06,780
sexually like fucking stop.
All right.

204
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,840
Because we know you're going to do that
to us too. You fucking creep, right.

205
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:15,120
Tattletale creep. You know that
a lot of girls like, you know,

206
00:11:15,121 --> 00:11:17,390
and then he couldn't get it
up and then God, I was like,

207
00:11:17,391 --> 00:11:21,360
is sent me and they're like, half of this
is you just trying to get me excited,

208
00:11:21,361 --> 00:11:24,510
but like, look, I can get it up. Fuck
him. Don't worry about him. You know,

209
00:11:24,511 --> 00:11:29,190
engaging in that sort of
a weird guy, masculine ego
thing where like, or you know,

210
00:11:29,191 --> 00:11:30,930
like wow, this poor girl,
she needs some Dick.

211
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,010
She's letting me know she needs object.

212
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:35,100
Like it's a little banter
and game you play. But, um,

213
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:39,270
this girl apparently could not come
without like for like a long time.

214
00:11:39,271 --> 00:11:40,950
Like she had a wean herself off of it.
Right.

215
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:45,600
You have not used anything for like a
year. She, she used to use shower heads,

216
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,590
so used to use the uh,
the faucet account.

217
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,030
Apparently when you're in the tub you
can crank that mother fucker fuck her up.

218
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,060
And she was built shoes,

219
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,020
the perfect height to slider pussy
right underneath the thing and just get

220
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:59,230
blasted on the snatch by the
fucking full stream of water.

221
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,660
And that's how she would orgasm.
Shoot our guys, I'm doing that.

222
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:04,750
And she would organize them with
vibrators and so like, she would like,

223
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:09,290
like fuck her dude and just be like,
you done? You done. Okay, good. Eh,

224
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:14,890
which has gotta be annoying
as fuck the dude. You know,

225
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,890
like if you're a chick wants you to put
that cock ring on all the time and like,

226
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:22,210
come on, really? Right. What are we doing
here? All right, fuck. Are we doing here?

227
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:26,440
I said hot brands, it's all
about this. I love baby.

228
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:31,420
He started becoming the chick, you know,
she just told me, can you just hold me?

229
00:12:31,421 --> 00:12:32,650
Why do I have to put it in your ass?

230
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,810
Yeah. It is funny though, the psychology
that the changes, if you're not,

231
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:40,800
if you don't really feel like you've
done the best job you could with a check

232
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:45,600
box here, you'll catch yourself
being not yourself. Fuck yeah.

233
00:12:45,601 --> 00:12:49,740
You seem like a weak bitch,
like given extra long massages.

234
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,150
Like why are you,
what am I doing here?

235
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,850
Oh Dude. Yeah, guys have
sexual problems, man.

236
00:12:55,851 --> 00:12:58,700
You could always see it
in the relationship. The
relationship is always bad.

237
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:03,170
They can't fuck right. Yep. Know. I know
dudes that you get addicted to porn,

238
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,110
you know? And uh, I've talked
to a couple of guys, you know,

239
00:13:06,111 --> 00:13:07,460
Bobby Lee was talking to us about it,

240
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:11,390
that Bobby Lee has a hard time getting
it up because he's just addicted to porn

241
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:13,190
cause he watches porn so much.
And then I'm like, you know,

242
00:13:13,191 --> 00:13:16,250
you would like a regular girl and you're
like, what's all this? What is this?

243
00:13:16,251 --> 00:13:19,760
What am I doing here? What am I doing
here? What is your heels, right. You know,

244
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,770
this is all your real hair.
What the fuck?

245
00:13:21,771 --> 00:13:26,120
You can't even wear your fake eyelashes.
You know, how can we, tits aren't hard.

246
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:30,460
Yeah. The fuck is going on. And he likes
the HD one. He's like pays for it. Yeah.

247
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,960
You buys the DVD,
he gets

248
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,600
tardy. He gets up in there.
Yeah. Yeah. I don't know TV.

249
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:39,530
It's a weird thing when people get really
like connected to some one particular

250
00:13:39,531 --> 00:13:43,230
thing that turns you on, you know?
And when some guys, man, it gets it,

251
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:48,170
it stops being regular.
People starts being the porn.
Yeah. Yeah. I guess that's,

252
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,960
that's the guy's trap is the
porn and the girls is the,

253
00:13:50,961 --> 00:13:54,410
is the vibrator sort of,
I mean,

254
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,350
girls get to porn to write,
don't girls get addicted to porn?

255
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,290
Yeah. I mean, I know a couple of girls.
Esther's addicted to porn, right though.

256
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:05,270
Like really ask like a guy
addicted, but she doesn't like, uh,

257
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:08,530
like 12 videos on her
phone of porn videos.

258
00:14:08,531 --> 00:14:12,050
I don't even have porn videos on my phone.
I just fucking go to like, you know,

259
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:14,230
some streaming porn site.
That might be a factor.

260
00:14:14,231 --> 00:14:17,380
The fact that she can't find very many
good ones, so she's got to save him.

261
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,860
You know what I'm saying? Like porn. It's
good for girls. It's hard to come by.

262
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,970
She bought, she bought Jenna Jamison
sweater off Ebay addicted to porn.

263
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,583
Whoa.

264
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:31,190
How many loads on that
sweater she's Christ have.

265
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,740
You can make a whole army of humans.

266
00:14:32,741 --> 00:14:35,350
Would that sweater just throw
that sweater head throw.

267
00:14:35,351 --> 00:14:38,150
That's one or two a few scientists
and go yo, there's some shit in there.

268
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:41,110
Do what you gotta do. Get some
biological material. Clone it.

269
00:14:41,111 --> 00:14:42,220
You'd have a Goddamn army.

270
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:46,300
Have you seen curses photo from Halloween
from two Coleen's ago where they all

271
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:49,870
him and all his friends all dressed up
as the characters from street fighter.

272
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,130
By the way,
I'm not that Jen and Jenna says

273
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:54,770
having sex with anyone other
than Tito Ortiz was just jokes.

274
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,030
Nobody get a fucking hurt pussy over
this. No sand, your vagina pleases.

275
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:03,800
These are just jokes. I
love Jenna Jameson. I love
Tito. These are just jokes.

276
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,590
You might be able to find loads
on my sweater too. How about that?

277
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:10,190
Maybe more than hers. It's happened.
Maybe more loads. Maybe Tito's.

278
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:13,910
Maybe I'm experimenting
with a gauntlet of loads,

279
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:18,380
but yeah, on his website.
Warrior poet, die or walk.
Chris's website. Warrior. Yeah.

280
00:15:18,381 --> 00:15:22,820
Chris is worry about warrior poet.us,
right? Yep. I it, he's got a great photo.

281
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:26,720
You got to check out. It's hilarious. I
mean they all look exactly like the staff.

282
00:15:26,721 --> 00:15:30,440
We got the full street fighter
four 16 person cast. Yeah.

283
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:31,940
He had like you had the shave

284
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,590
talking about just random people in
the streets. No, all our buddies. Oh,

285
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,870
you guys are dorks. You guys like those
Avatar people that pretend to be blue.

286
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:45,550
Kill out. Rick made Avatar. We
recreated the father's home tree.

287
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:49,640
Yeah, but if he's still on
that, I saw that on Halloween.
You, you'd be like, wow,

288
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,510
that's fucking right.

289
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:54,420
Mason. There was a really funny,
a online video. Where was that?

290
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,830
It was a spoof of these avatar people
that recreate avatar and it was like,

291
00:15:58,831 --> 00:16:01,530
you know, it was just a parenting.
It was, but it was really funny.

292
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,930
But the funny thing is
that people really do that,

293
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,090
but at least if you're doing avatar,

294
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:11,010
you're doing something fantastical and
w and w fantasy filled in. Wonderful.

295
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:14,180
What about these assholes that pretend
they're in the civil war? Right. You know,

296
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,840
we're going to recruit a boodle where
you were going to come over the hill,

297
00:16:16,841 --> 00:16:21,750
go through food, you know you're going
to fall. Yeah. What do you do? It's on,

298
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,680
did you guys hear about just be one
thing if they had paintball guns,

299
00:16:24,681 --> 00:16:27,840
your website or a crush your
website stat into stride scenarios.

300
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,050
Well, we just crushed your website back
quickly to welcome to the power of the

301
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,000
podcast. It, it got my
webmaster, is it wordpress?

302
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,560
Does their mother fucking saga continues?
Yeah.

303
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:41,140
We've crushed many a website on the show.
I actually enjoy doing it now.

304
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:44,770
There's something I like to mention a
website and watching them all the fucker

305
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,990
bolster the bolster,
the defenses.

306
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:50,950
It's more of a flow of wordpress
got problems with ours, man.

307
00:16:50,951 --> 00:16:52,660
We've had problems
whenever the podcast run.

308
00:16:52,661 --> 00:16:56,110
So I'm just got to separate everything
on the two servers cause I've a message

309
00:16:56,111 --> 00:17:00,720
board and a regular blog and
when the podcast hits you
can access it through the,

310
00:17:00,721 --> 00:17:03,310
the the regular blog.
And when you access it through the blog,

311
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:06,250
it's like everything else just slows
down to a fucking creep because there's

312
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,460
thousands of people hitting.
And really honestly not that many.

313
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,470
I mean it's only like a
couple of thousand at a time.

314
00:17:11,471 --> 00:17:15,280
It's amazing like how little it
takes to crush a website, you know,

315
00:17:15,281 --> 00:17:17,210
a couple thousand hits at
once and it just crushed.

316
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,710
What the fuck are we prepared for it.
It's kind of weak ass shit is this,

317
00:17:20,711 --> 00:17:20,951
you know,

318
00:17:20,951 --> 00:17:23,590
it's not like a television where everyone
could tune into distinction at the

319
00:17:23,591 --> 00:17:25,990
same time.
It's a flawed system.

320
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,350
But if you have, if you have a server
set up right and prepared for that,

321
00:17:29,351 --> 00:17:31,900
you'll be fine using like cloud servers.
But the problem is is you know,

322
00:17:31,901 --> 00:17:33,700
you get your private
server and that's just,

323
00:17:33,701 --> 00:17:37,260
if you think about a private server is
one computer. So imagine 2000 people.

324
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,570
We have appeared to have a
dedicated server for that
and a couple of other sites,

325
00:17:40,571 --> 00:17:44,410
but we probably should go to the cloud,
go to the cloud.

326
00:17:44,411 --> 00:17:45,610
So I'm to go to the cloud bitches.

327
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,220
Did you hear about that NBC employee
that got fired because leaked a video of

328
00:17:50,221 --> 00:17:55,140
Bryant Gumbel and whatever that chick's
name from the today show from 1994 where

329
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:58,680
they were talking about the Internet
and they both did not know what the

330
00:17:58,681 --> 00:18:02,010
Internet was. 94 I know. Who the
fuck. Who the fuck cares, right?

331
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:06,390
The guy got fired from NBC cause he put
it on Youtube and now NBC is trying to

332
00:18:06,391 --> 00:18:10,110
take down the clip from youtube. I mean
it, why? Cause they look like fools. Yeah,

333
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,450
it's 94 okay,
so but play it,

334
00:18:12,451 --> 00:18:15,180
we have to find out how someone lost
their job offers. Here is these,

335
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,160
you know what it is man?
It's the infrastructure.

336
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:20,010
These old fucks that are still
in charge of these corporations.

337
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:20,880
They just have not caught

338
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,410
the fuck up. Okay, here we go.

339
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:27,800
[inaudible] what they say
and then the ring around it.

340
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:33,440
So that's where I said, okay. You said
you thought it was about, yeah. Oh,

341
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,120
they didn't know what at means.
Tom Content.

342
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,400
All right, mark, but then where I said I
love it. Can you turn it louder? Abroad.

343
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,580
That's allows again.
What are you around in the lecture?

344
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:48,780
We say I at NBC. Ge Calm. I mean,

345
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:52,600
well, what Alison should
know. What is the loud anyway?

346
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:57,090
Internet is a massive computer at work.

347
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:00,840
The one that's becoming really big now.
What do you mean?

348
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:03,720
That's a big way I was wanting to know
with what are you white taught? Like male.

349
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,850
A lot of people use it.
Communicate if,

350
00:19:05,851 --> 00:19:08,880
I guess they can communicate with
NBC writers and producers. Elephant,

351
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,020
can you explain what Internet is? No, she
can't say anything. 10 seconds or less.

352
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,470
Oh,
Alison will be in the studio shortly.

353
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:21,210
What did what the name Peter Never
made up? Made up of? Started from,

354
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,890
Oh, I thought you were
gonna tell us what this was.

355
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,070
If you're looking at the numbers,
it's

356
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:33,390
still a university. Right. And
others could access it, right?

357
00:19:33,391 --> 00:19:36,570
It's getting bigger and bigger role.
Just really handy during the quake.

358
00:19:36,571 --> 00:19:37,171
A lot of people,

359
00:19:37,171 --> 00:19:39,630
that's how they were communicating
out to tell family and loved ones.

360
00:19:39,631 --> 00:19:41,590
They were okay because all
the phone lines were down.

361
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:43,680
I was telling Katie and over again,
you don't need that.

362
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,970
You don't need a phone line to
operate it out. No, probably not.

363
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:50,730
So Katie was talking to a lot of people
out there like who are afraid to go to

364
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,820
sleep. Really? Yeah. They're scared
to go stick. A lot of people,

365
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,630
particularly those who live alone are,
are afraid to be there.

366
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,730
They're getting into bed.
Did Jamie share,

367
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,680
how did you segue from the Internet
to being scared to go to sleep alone?

368
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:07,720
They'll start off with a tremor will
come through [inaudible] talk more about

369
00:20:07,721 --> 00:20:10,450
dinner and again go back to sleep and
there were a lot of people now who are

370
00:20:10,451 --> 00:20:13,120
suffering from sleep deprivation.
Okay,

371
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,460
let's just kill it right there. That's
fascinating. I'm saving that right now.

372
00:20:16,461 --> 00:20:18,440
I went to keep vid.com by the way,

373
00:20:18,441 --> 00:20:20,630
if there's anything that you
can find on the Internet,

374
00:20:20,631 --> 00:20:22,370
like a youtube clip that like,
oh shit,

375
00:20:22,371 --> 00:20:24,350
what if they find out about
this is going to get yanked,

376
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:27,560
go to keep vid.com keep k,

377
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:31,480
k e P v I d.com and there's a,
an application.

378
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,620
What it lets you do is you,

379
00:20:32,621 --> 00:20:37,621
you put in the URL of the youtube clip
and then all you have to do is press a,

380
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:38,841
uh,
you know,

381
00:20:38,841 --> 00:20:42,950
follow the instructions and pick what
resolution you want and what format and

382
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:43,640
you can download it.

383
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,170
Yeah. And if you have Mac, I've
noticed it doesn't work on chrome. Yes.

384
00:20:47,171 --> 00:20:48,150
It doesn't work on safari

385
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,610
either. I think it works on
Firefox. Safari doesn't work on me,

386
00:20:51,611 --> 00:20:54,460
I just take them off. It doesn't work on
chrome though at all. For some reason.

387
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:58,180
Maybe I've got it set up wrong, but, uh, I
don't, I'm not a fan of chrome. I use it,

388
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,590
but it shows too many distortions on
websites and I have been going back and

389
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,720
forth. I've, I'm still stuck
with chrome for some reason.

390
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,160
I think it's better than safari.

391
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:09,220
My problem with safari is that
flash does not work good in safari.

392
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,710
Like I don't know if
that's flash versus apple,

393
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:16,060
but it seems like safari flash crashes
way more than it does in chrome. Um,

394
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:16,390
you know,

395
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,880
why is it embarrassing to them that they
didn't know what the Internet was in

396
00:21:18,881 --> 00:21:20,990
1994?
What the fuck is why?

397
00:21:20,991 --> 00:21:24,340
Why does everyone have to look like they
knew everything all the time? I mean,

398
00:21:24,341 --> 00:21:26,770
that's the only one.
Anybody should be upset at that,

399
00:21:26,771 --> 00:21:30,460
that NBC should be fascinated by,
that. They should put that online.

400
00:21:30,461 --> 00:21:35,140
They should put that on the today show
today. Look at us like a fun clip.

401
00:21:35,141 --> 00:21:37,310
Should look at us.
Look at us from,

402
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,640
and if there's two 17 years ago released
a statement like, and just said,

403
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,240
look at this. Wasn't this funny back then
the Internet was in its infancy. Yeah.

404
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:47,200
You know, and then people would
be like, wow, that's crazy.

405
00:21:47,201 --> 00:21:48,340
Instead they're trying to hush.

406
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,860
It makes you think there needs
to be something to be hushed,

407
00:21:50,861 --> 00:21:53,950
which makes you think that these guys
are dummies when really they would been

408
00:21:53,951 --> 00:21:56,350
like any of them. Exactly.
They're ashamed of themselves,

409
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:59,600
which is what Charlie Sheen is the
baddest motherfucker on the planet.

410
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:03,400
Cause he ain't, he ain't ashamed.
Hey, any apologies. He's weird.

411
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,990
Fake mustaches and pick it up.
Hookers. Fucking Bryant Gumbel.

412
00:22:07,991 --> 00:22:10,990
You Pussy. Is it you? Are you?
Are you scared Bryant? Yes.

413
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,210
You scared of everybody knowing that
you didn't know what the Internet was.

414
00:22:13,211 --> 00:22:16,900
I bet that's what it is. I met Brian
Campbell is in alone in his office.

415
00:22:16,901 --> 00:22:20,680
All delusional. Detach from
society going, who put this online?

416
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:24,140
I'd want his job. You
know, he's not on his job.

417
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,710
You know he's not on the unit level.
Yeah.

418
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,090
He's one of those guys that
refuses to go in the Internet.

419
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,880
I don't think you're right. No, I
think everyone's on the Internet now.

420
00:22:30,881 --> 00:22:31,930
If you want to be a journalist,

421
00:22:31,931 --> 00:22:34,540
there's not a chance in hell you can
stay off the Internet and stay active.

422
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,840
My Stepdad, who is a porn
will architect, nothing else.

423
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,290
My stepdad had come cut a ton of
fat white broad's on his computer.

424
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:46,060
I bet that's all it is. Fat, greasy, white
bitches eaten chicken. Big Black guys.

425
00:22:46,061 --> 00:22:50,140
Could you imagine how bad ass it would
be if you got to Brian crumbles and all

426
00:22:50,141 --> 00:22:54,610
of his shit was like dudes with bones
in their noses and giant Afros and just

427
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,880
the black cause he's the
whitest black guy ever, right?

428
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,720
The just the blackest of the black.

429
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:03,750
All just fucking these greasy fat zit
asked white bitches just trailer pitches

430
00:23:04,691 --> 00:23:07,300
with dirty socks on and shit. Just, yeah,

431
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,900
I would love to find
out what kind of porn,

432
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,940
Brian Collins Collins fucking
computer. They do. You Go,

433
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:14,890
you go to one of these shows like the AVN
and you see these sites and it's like,

434
00:23:14,891 --> 00:23:19,000
how do you even come up with that
exactly what they do. It's also strange,

435
00:23:19,001 --> 00:23:22,550
isn't it man? It's also strange
for people get into, but it's,

436
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,510
this is disturbing to me that
someone lost their job for that.

437
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,770
I should have been given a
raise, you know, or at least
recognize for, as you know,

438
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,960
for Lao. Just found this. That's
amazing. That's a good job. Yeah.

439
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:36,950
And people are gonna eat up.
I would be laughing if house Brian come,

440
00:23:36,951 --> 00:23:40,090
I would be asking you to play that.
I'd be like play that Jesus kept crook.

441
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,280
And if you imagine what
has changed in 17 years,

442
00:23:42,281 --> 00:23:45,440
cause it's like there's nothing
embarrassing about not knowing that then,

443
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,431
you know,

444
00:23:46,431 --> 00:23:50,660
in 1994 there's nothing embarrassing about
Bryant Gumbel or the the other chick.

445
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:50,901
No,

446
00:23:50,901 --> 00:23:55,550
you should hear about this
story and fucking write the
producers of that show or

447
00:23:55,551 --> 00:23:59,090
NBC goes, look, do not fire
this guy. Give him his job back.

448
00:23:59,091 --> 00:24:02,990
Stopping a fucking retard. Yes,
absolutely. I 100% agree. Yeah,

449
00:24:02,991 --> 00:24:06,430
that's a very good point Brian.
Yeah. This, this is ridiculous.

450
00:24:06,431 --> 00:24:07,610
If someone lost their job for them,

451
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,350
you know, I heard a, I
heard a story about the uh,

452
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:14,990
the kind of the father of the
modern computer. This guy,

453
00:24:14,991 --> 00:24:18,680
Alan Turing was a British guy and he
basically developed what was going to be

454
00:24:18,681 --> 00:24:20,300
the groundwork for the binary system.

455
00:24:20,301 --> 00:24:25,100
They know the ones in Zeros and a
brilliant guy created like the touring con

456
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:28,370
computing system or whatever.
And also actually helped, uh,

457
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:32,270
help the allied forces decode the codes
that we're going to the u boats from the

458
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:35,750
Nazis. Why? And I created the
system that help, help do that.

459
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:40,760
But the fucked up thing was, and what
caught my attention is it's like 1952, um,

460
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:41,683
he got,

461
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:46,810
he got a convicted of gross indecency by
the UK cause he was a gay man and they,

462
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:50,930
the, the punishment at that point
was injections of female hormones.

463
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:55,070
So they started injecting this dude,
whoa forcibly with female hormones.

464
00:24:55,071 --> 00:24:57,860
Wait a minute,
that's the punishment for gross indecency.

465
00:24:57,861 --> 00:25:01,520
And he committed suicide two years
later, like tragedy. He was only like,

466
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,290
I think he was under 50 years old.

467
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:08,410
Wow. What is wrong with that?
I knew English folks back
then. Raise that. You would,

468
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,820
that would be the punishment. And this
was like what year was this? It was a two.

469
00:25:11,821 --> 00:25:16,470
I think he died. Yeah, 52. Alan Turing.
T. U. R. I. N. G. You can read this.

470
00:25:16,471 --> 00:25:20,490
Incredible. It is. So what were they
trying to do? Turning into a woman?

471
00:25:20,491 --> 00:25:22,740
I guess it was supposed
to lower his sex drive.

472
00:25:22,741 --> 00:25:26,280
So he wouldn't be humping dudes because
he had too much excess estrogen and

473
00:25:26,281 --> 00:25:27,720
whatever else they put in them.

474
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:32,610
Who the fuck do you imagine the horror
of like getting state injected female

475
00:25:32,611 --> 00:25:37,020
hormones, which just made you feel all
fucking tracked? Oh my God, terrible.

476
00:25:37,021 --> 00:25:41,040
She just crying after he helped. He
helped decode the fucking codes for the u,

477
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:45,780
but he should have been given, you know,
here's 20 boys to men do adore you.

478
00:25:45,781 --> 00:25:49,710
You know, like there's a bunch of
dudes like, where's the fucking honor?

479
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:54,270
It's a nice helping much
things which launched in 70
years, 60 70 years. You know,

480
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,310
it's really kind of crazy
when you think about it.

481
00:25:56,311 --> 00:26:00,270
You know how much more things are accepted
now and that is a direct result of

482
00:26:00,271 --> 00:26:01,840
the spread of information.
Yup.

483
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,400
People kind of understand the gay people
aren't twisted and fucked up and you

484
00:26:05,401 --> 00:26:07,810
know, it's like the ignorance
is the real issue. There's a,

485
00:26:07,811 --> 00:26:11,550
a crazy store that I read today,
um, from God, I forget where it was.

486
00:26:11,551 --> 00:26:13,320
I think it might've been Florida,
I forget the state,

487
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:18,321
but a guy stabbed his friend because he
found out his friend was a Muslim and

488
00:26:18,961 --> 00:26:22,500
they apparently lived in the same town,
hung out together a bunch of times.

489
00:26:22,501 --> 00:26:25,230
They were talking in their 50s okay,
they're at a bar,

490
00:26:25,231 --> 00:26:29,940
they're talking in a bar and the guy
mentions that he's Muslim and so the other

491
00:26:29,941 --> 00:26:34,300
guy just fucking stabs him in the neck.
She says, yeah, and he gets arrested.

492
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:34,591
He's like,

493
00:26:34,591 --> 00:26:38,090
Muslims are the causes of problems with
this whole world and I don't like what

494
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,950
you just stabbed that guy in the neck
because he said it was a Muslim like

495
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,530
faggotry

496
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:48,570
where this association with just
the grip on reality. Some people,

497
00:26:48,571 --> 00:26:51,450
you know the amazing thing though really,
and this is something to focus on,

498
00:26:51,451 --> 00:26:53,220
this is something that's
actually very important.

499
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:58,430
We are not supposed to know about that
guy because he is fucking nowhere near

500
00:26:59,431 --> 00:26:59,970
us.

501
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:04,970
The real issue with human beings is
that we're set up to deal with immediate

502
00:27:05,071 --> 00:27:06,960
danger,
immediate threats,

503
00:27:06,961 --> 00:27:10,890
immediate positive and negative aspects
of our life right here and now what's

504
00:27:10,891 --> 00:27:15,360
here. But now because of the Internet and
because of television and the news and

505
00:27:15,361 --> 00:27:20,100
movies, we have access to this fucking
massive chain of shit that's coming in.

506
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:25,220
So we're not learning about 300 million
people even we're learning about

507
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:27,690
billions. The whole world
over. The more fucked up it is,

508
00:27:27,691 --> 00:27:30,420
the more you're going to hear about it,
right? You know serial killers and Russia,

509
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:33,600
fucking guy who eats babies and you
go Slavia where the fuck is happening

510
00:27:33,601 --> 00:27:34,920
completely unrelated to you.

511
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,800
It's all just going to come swarming
NIH to the point where you'll have your

512
00:27:37,801 --> 00:27:41,430
fucking completely terrified.
But if you really look at it,

513
00:27:41,431 --> 00:27:43,710
as long as you don't live in the
shittiest of Shitty neighborhoods,

514
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:47,640
if you really look at it, it's amazing
how well people get along, right?

515
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:52,230
It really is quite amazing if you
really stop and think about it,

516
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:57,360
that we can get through 30 40 years of
a life and never been in a fist fight.

517
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:01,020
I know a lot of guys who have never been
in funeral benefits plant right into

518
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:04,830
two, but they were middle school and the
middle is freshmen. It's amazing lived.

519
00:28:04,831 --> 00:28:05,101
I mean,

520
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:09,270
I've lived a life around a lot of that
and it was only two years ago that I got

521
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:13,230
in my first actual street fist fight.
Well, I mean if you go to bars,

522
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,390
it can happen. It can happen, but
it's amazing. No, it's hilarious.

523
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:20,430
It's incredible how rare it
happens. Even at UFC, I mean,

524
00:28:20,431 --> 00:28:23,100
how many times you've been to UFC though?
The audience is drunk.

525
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:28,160
It's at least 10% skulled tee
shirt wearing meatheads. Right.

526
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:32,580
At least 10% and still very few fights.
But that is another factor at work there.

527
00:28:32,581 --> 00:28:35,320
If you find someone at a
UFC, you're never know. Yeah.

528
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:39,920
Someone from American top team who
hasn't made it to TV, Cincinnati,

529
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,470
you're wearing that same teacher.
Check his ears, homie. Yeah, exactly.

530
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:48,120
That's not a malice living inside of here.
It's a little risky w yeah,

531
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:51,540
that's true. But there's also, you know,
dudes think through the Falcon. Oh,

532
00:28:51,541 --> 00:28:53,840
of course. The folk in man, of course.

533
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:58,350
Can't believe Rashad Evans pulled out
that photoed pushy like guys are like,

534
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:58,681
you know,

535
00:28:58,681 --> 00:29:02,400
send me Twitter messages or email messages
called fighters pussies and I'll just

536
00:29:02,401 --> 00:29:05,340
go, oh my God, y'all silly. This is like,

537
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:09,630
this is like a little baby crying
right now. This is just nonsense.

538
00:29:09,631 --> 00:29:13,650
You're saying nonsense. You tell me a
professional cage fighter is a pussy.

539
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:17,880
Even the worst professional
cage fighter is not a pussy.

540
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:20,720
The worst one that's ever lived,
he's not a pussy. All right.

541
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,640
Even if he fucking taps out after
he gets hit a bunch of times,

542
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:27,690
you would tap out quicker. Stupid.
Right? All right, let's not, let's go.

543
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,940
No praying. Oh God, no food.

544
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,470
People love to make up shit.

545
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:37,200
I was reading up all the shit
that Steven Seagal is made up.

546
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:40,050
I'll throw his career cause there's a
whole thing going on right now where

547
00:29:40,051 --> 00:29:43,820
Steven Seagal told everyone that Anderson
Silva, he taught Anderson that case.

548
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,790
Right? Which is kind of what
he's supposed to do, right?

549
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:48,580
I mean he's this videos of him training
with the Anderson will fucking Anderson

550
00:29:48,581 --> 00:29:49,720
who barely speaks English.

551
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:52,090
They just run around and tell
everybody that you taught them it.

552
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:55,210
And you know what Anderson so cool.
He'll probably be like, yeah, yeah,

553
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:59,090
he taught me he's a good guy. People
thought that was just him playing at goop.

554
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:03,590
But Anderson Anderson might,
people do a little wing Chung and the,

555
00:30:03,591 --> 00:30:04,540
and he always does that.

556
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:07,420
He'll do a little like moving the hands
funny and he's just letting you know

557
00:30:07,421 --> 00:30:11,080
he's ready to fucking explode in your
face to kick you in the chin. Yeah.

558
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:14,170
That was ridiculous. Was
ridiculous. Really saying that.

559
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,060
Is He really saying that he's
the one that taught him? Yeah.

560
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:19,720
Steven's Goldsboro send their boss route
and went fucking crazy and boss route.

561
00:30:19,721 --> 00:30:21,850
I'm going to go do an
advertisement for his gem,

562
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,500
so I'm gonna try to get
him on the podcast too.

563
00:30:23,501 --> 00:30:27,610
Cause Pos Rutan we'll have some fucking
amazing stories of brawls and Holland.

564
00:30:27,611 --> 00:30:29,600
He's just a savage.
I love boss ruin,

565
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:33,370
but Pasc went crazy on Twitter and he's
like, you know what planet is he from?

566
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:35,620
Did he learn this from fucking Disneyland?
He's like,

567
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,940
boss roots go crazy on Twitter.
Is that he's angry at Steven.

568
00:30:38,941 --> 00:30:41,870
I heard all hired an
unverified story about, uh,

569
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:45,520
when gene labelle and Steven Seagal
had on, yeah, that's true story.

570
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:48,400
That's an absolute true story.
[inaudible] the bell told me that story.

571
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,230
Jean Jean tells you it like this.

572
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:53,260
He doesn't actually tell you
those stories and wow. You know,

573
00:30:53,261 --> 00:30:55,960
Steven was trying to say that
no one could choke 'em out.

574
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,240
You can't choke them out.
He had this move,

575
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:02,070
this move or stop you from choking out.
So, you know, I got all right Steve,

576
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:05,380
let's try it. And I get
him in. I had locked there,

577
00:31:05,381 --> 00:31:08,950
I get them in the rear naked and uh,
he takes this hand,

578
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:12,460
the free hand in and you cherish
karate chops me. Right. And you know,

579
00:31:12,461 --> 00:31:16,470
the old sisters and there's like, you
know, the way genial bell talks about,

580
00:31:16,471 --> 00:31:19,120
I wouldn't even say, as Paul
says, the nicest guy ever.

581
00:31:19,121 --> 00:31:23,110
He would say stuff like right in the
old Johnson, you know, and then a while.

582
00:31:23,111 --> 00:31:27,190
And then I guess he got tired after doing
that and he just fell asleep, I guess.

583
00:31:27,191 --> 00:31:31,000
Uh, maybe forgot to go to the bathroom.
So I went to the bathroom then

584
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:37,030
it'd be no gene Lebell. Sheila
Bell is like, first of all,

585
00:31:37,031 --> 00:31:39,670
he was like one of the
original mixed martial artists.

586
00:31:39,671 --> 00:31:43,770
He's a judo guy that had cage fights or it
wasn't a cage. It was, uh, you know, um,

587
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:47,500
uh, uh, basically a mixed rules fight
where he fought a boxer, you know,

588
00:31:47,501 --> 00:31:50,560
he fought a boxer with his judogi on and
just took the boxer down and beat his

589
00:31:50,561 --> 00:31:52,300
ass. You know, gene was like,

590
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:55,390
he's like the guy that taught Bruce
Lee about grappling, you know,

591
00:31:55,391 --> 00:31:58,780
Bruce Lee back in the day thought you
could just karate kick everybody in the

592
00:31:58,781 --> 00:32:00,490
head. And that would, that
was the shit, you know.

593
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:03,310
And Bruce Lee actually worked on a lot
of like more effective things like leg

594
00:32:03,311 --> 00:32:05,110
kicks and short range techniques,

595
00:32:05,111 --> 00:32:06,940
wing Chung and boxing
punches and stuff like that.

596
00:32:06,941 --> 00:32:10,690
But he really wasn't aware about grappling
until he hooked up with Jean Labelle

597
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,110
and Jean lapels, a fucking
gorilla. He should just, you know,

598
00:32:14,111 --> 00:32:18,700
national champion judo player. And he's
just so fucking ridiculously strong.

599
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:22,610
And I'm sure he grabbed that little hunt
and tidy for 35 bell Chinese man had a

600
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,410
fucking shit his pants going. Okay, now
we learn crappola you know what I mean?

601
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:29,290
He has had to learn grappling after you
fucked around with gene labelle. Yeah.

602
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:32,860
So Gina Bell telling the story, you
know, it makes it extra funny. But,

603
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:38,410
but he was at the UFC again. He's in,
in uh, into Anderson Silva's corner. Oh,

604
00:32:38,411 --> 00:32:41,070
nice. He's always a Steven Seagal is
always an Anderson Silva supposedly.

605
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:43,880
I don't know. How did they, how
did they get together? They made,

606
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,270
it's just like a fan and you
wanted to tell you what dude,

607
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,580
the bottom line is whatever you think
might think silly above Steven Seagal.

608
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,250
The mother motherfucker was
a serious Iko guy. You know,

609
00:32:52,251 --> 00:32:56,030
like if you watch is that Quito videos?
He's not completely full of shit.

610
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:59,390
All right. I'm not a fan of Ikea.
I think it's silly nonsense.

611
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:01,860
But if you're going to get good at
silly nonsense with the [inaudible],

612
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:04,490
which I kind of did, I got
really good at taekwondo. Right.

613
00:33:04,491 --> 00:33:06,140
And a lot of that silly nonsense lie,

614
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:09,040
that shit doesn't work when dudes are
shooting doubles on you and trop elbows at

615
00:33:09,041 --> 00:33:12,740
your face, Steven Seagal are and the
different kind of silly nonsense.

616
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:16,160
And it's not all silly nonsense.
It's just that out of all of it,

617
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:18,620
what percentage of it would actually
work against someone knew what the fuck

618
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:21,050
they're doing. That's the most
important thing about martial arts.

619
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,840
It's got to work on someone who
knows how to fight. Right. You know,

620
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,770
like you always talk to those street
fight guys like we brought you the street

621
00:33:27,771 --> 00:33:31,790
tempo. We work on street Campbell,
basically a lot of techniques, um,

622
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:36,080
involving a mailboxes, whatever
you're finding the street. Yeah.

623
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:38,680
You know how to slam a
guy into a news reader.

624
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:43,730
It's like they'll have like fucking
techniques. So will you take your keys,

625
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:44,870
you put them in between your non,

626
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:48,480
now you essentially have a deadly weapon
in your hand and they're like your keys

627
00:33:48,481 --> 00:33:49,101
or poking out.

628
00:33:49,101 --> 00:33:51,740
Like how long does it take to get your
fucking keys and stick your knuckles in

629
00:33:51,741 --> 00:33:54,320
them and hold them. Get the fuck out
of here. If you're getting in a fight,

630
00:33:54,321 --> 00:33:56,040
do you really want to
puncture someone's throat?

631
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,530
Sounds like something that you would get
your tight at. Rates School. You know,

632
00:33:58,531 --> 00:34:03,110
you don't get raped ladies. Put your
keys down. Yeah, that stuff. Yeah, yeah,

633
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:03,950
yeah.
Those,

634
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:06,800
those rape classes or do you ever seen
that when they put the guy puts on the

635
00:34:06,801 --> 00:34:08,600
big blue suit and the wind scream no.

636
00:34:08,601 --> 00:34:12,230
And just kick them and kicking is the
mind lie on your back and learn how to

637
00:34:12,231 --> 00:34:14,660
kick. Learn how to use a
guard. Learn how to put a desk.

638
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,240
If a woman wants to learn how to fight,
you should learn Jujitsu.

639
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:19,490
Cause the reality is it's a very rare,

640
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:21,260
unless you're like an
exceptionally strong women,

641
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:24,500
like I've met some women that have like
good bone structure that's strong and

642
00:34:24,501 --> 00:34:26,870
you're like, wow, this chick
punches. She could fucking hurt you.

643
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,970
Like one of the dudes who work for um,

644
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,760
a fear factor had an assistant and
she was just like, uh, you know,

645
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:35,720
corn fed girl just fucking not fat at all.
She was like only 130 pounds,

646
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:39,980
but this bitch could punch so hard. It
was ridiculous. She, she like told me,

647
00:34:39,981 --> 00:34:41,810
she was like, I could punch
really hard. I'm like, okay,

648
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,980
I get my hand and she hit my hand.
I want damn.

649
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:47,090
And I thought about like her
punching me in the face. I'm like,

650
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:49,580
this is what you might be a little,
knock me out if she sucker punched me.

651
00:34:49,581 --> 00:34:52,640
Like she fucking hits hard, get
out, get caught. You never know.

652
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,900
Most girls can't do it. Most girls don't
know how to punch that heart. It's,

653
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:58,220
it's a rare thing. So for most girls,
if they want to learn how to fight,

654
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:00,950
they're gonna learn how to use
their legs and learn how to grapple.

655
00:35:00,951 --> 00:35:02,000
Because if you learn Jujitsu,

656
00:35:02,001 --> 00:35:05,900
you could really mobilize someone who is
much stronger than you just with 10 it

657
00:35:05,901 --> 00:35:09,310
seems like a, a good triangle choke
should be a mandatory hard to do.

658
00:35:09,311 --> 00:35:10,280
If a guy knows,
I mean,

659
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,250
if a guy knows how to fight your
phone or in a rape scenario, yeah,

660
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,560
but at least he can eat your gun. Hold
on. Be In guard anyways. Right? Yeah.

661
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:20,210
You know, I mean, I suppose there's a
good chance they could slap that on.

662
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:22,140
He's got to know what was going on,
you know,

663
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:26,150
and choke him out cold on his fucking leg.
Make sure it doesn't slam me. But yeah,

664
00:35:26,151 --> 00:35:27,830
you have to, um, you know,

665
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,860
you have to learn how to use your legs
because your legs are what's carrying you

666
00:35:30,861 --> 00:35:32,840
around all day. You know,
for a woman, her arms,

667
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:36,410
you don't even realize what
percentage is weak or your arms are,

668
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,770
and that's what your weapons are.

669
00:35:37,771 --> 00:35:40,230
You thinking about hitting
someone with your hands? Yeah.

670
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:42,540
What are your hands doing all day?
They ain't doing shit, but Karen,

671
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:45,990
your purse and fingering yourself, right?
That's not a lot of energy expended.

672
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:49,320
All right? You don't mean what
your legs are carrying 150, 130,

673
00:35:49,321 --> 00:35:51,420
whatever the fuck you way they're
carrying that around all day.

674
00:35:51,421 --> 00:35:54,960
You'd legs are ridiculously strong.
It's like an ostrich. You know,

675
00:35:54,961 --> 00:35:56,280
you get ahold of the ostrich wing,

676
00:35:56,281 --> 00:35:58,050
what does that going to do it they
don't even work. They don't do,

677
00:35:58,051 --> 00:36:00,270
but they'll kick a fucking
hole in your chest. Yeah,

678
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:05,250
those big meaty ostrich thighs. Those are
crumb looking. Remember our Crum, the uh,

679
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,470
you know our chrome is a
comic book artist. Yeah.

680
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:11,070
I used to draw these women with those
big giant ostrich asses. Awesome.

681
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:14,490
He said what a weird movie that crumb
movie. Yeah. That's fascinating man.

682
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,810
Fascinating. Anyway, did you watch
the Super Bowl? Of course not.

683
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,870
I don't give a fuck about football. Did
you sleep? I didn't even know who won.

684
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,610
I didn't,
not only did I not know who won,

685
00:36:23,611 --> 00:36:26,580
I didn't even know who was in it until
after it was over. I had no idea.

686
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:30,660
I am completely blissfully unaware
of football. I don't get it.

687
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:34,410
But what I did get was that Christina
Aguilar a fuck up on the national anthem.

688
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:38,310
Oh, I love when someone fucks up. I
don't know why. And look, if it was me,

689
00:36:38,311 --> 00:36:39,300
I'd be embarrassed too.

690
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:42,900
But there's something about every one
of us that loves when someone fucking

691
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:47,300
chunks. How do you act like I know
nerds and stuff that you're a singer,

692
00:36:47,301 --> 00:36:50,540
so how do you fuck up the one song
that everybody knows you're ready?

693
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:55,000
Yeah, she's fat. Oh, that's why.

694
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:58,840
Can't look forward to the next thing. You
have hamburgers. The first one. Listen,

695
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:03,170
bitch, you ain't tricking anybody by
wearing black and ain't dark out. Okay.

696
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:06,560
We see a large black object I screen.

697
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:10,720
You know she's thinking Baconator
Baconator Baconator what are you doing?

698
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:13,510
I understand divorce is hard on
everybody, sweetie. That's good.

699
00:37:13,511 --> 00:37:17,290
But you've got like $1 billion and you
need to hire a fucking trainer. Okay.

700
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:19,180
Eats of vegetables every now and then.
Now,

701
00:37:19,181 --> 00:37:22,720
did she fuck up once or twice or did she,
I don't know the words,

702
00:37:22,721 --> 00:37:25,680
the national anthem, but it was
definitely wrong. All right. Just listen,

703
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:26,920
listen to listen to it.

704
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,960
She apparently fucked up the lyrics and
switched it around and repeated lyrics

705
00:37:31,961 --> 00:37:32,930
in some shit.
Yup.

706
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:35,890
Unlike just you could look over and see
football players in the audience and

707
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,980
they were mouthing, I think she
fucked up. They're like mouth thing.

708
00:37:38,981 --> 00:37:42,700
I think she fucked that up to a
higher America. Wrapping Award.

709
00:37:42,701 --> 00:37:45,290
Witnessing to this guy's
fake voice. Acular off. Okay.

710
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:49,210
I should be at a strip club in
Ohio coming to the Stephen King.

711
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,610
Yeah,
you'd be the king of Oscar.

712
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,720
[inaudible] you.

713
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:01,700
Hey [inaudible]

714
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,493
word.

715
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:14,340
Yay.
[inaudible]

716
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:20,340
who rose? No, this is still okay.

717
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:25,420
Garage [inaudible] script.

718
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:31,460
Woo.
Woo.

719
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:32,563
Hooray.

720
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:35,190
Locked up for the ramparts we watched

721
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,513
[inaudible]

722
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:40,220
oh, she fucked up. She, she said that

723
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:44,300
twice. Oh my gosh. She
fucked up hard dude.

724
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:49,450
[inaudible]

725
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,233
yeah,

726
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:05,620
she just fucked up that part.

727
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,940
She repeated herself twice.

728
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:15,110
[inaudible]

729
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:18,260
you gotta think about the song,
I mean, this is talking about

730
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:20,300
bombs going off in this guy.

731
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,520
Sorry.
I'd rather we're such cocksuckers.

732
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:28,430
I always say the United States
is the balls of the Dick.

733
00:39:28,431 --> 00:39:32,420
That's fucking the world. That's what
we are as citizens in this crazy,

734
00:39:32,421 --> 00:39:37,280
ridiculous rocket shooting
rockets at our own lyrics.

735
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:42,230
The national anthem has rockets and bombs

736
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:48,710
and we are fighting for freedom though.
Talking about the glare of rockets.

737
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,270
Red Glare,

738
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:54,900
red glare of rockets like so many
rockets that changed the night.

739
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,730
You already did that one did
it twice, Fella. You did that.

740
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,230
How sad is that? Did that poor girl
fucked up like that. That's pretty rough.

741
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:07,690
Do people realize it too?
But they still cheered.

742
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:10,890
I wonder if she got off going on. If
anybody know, if anybody knew. Well,

743
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,940
I think how her style of singing or like,

744
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:14,320
I couldn't even understand
what she was like, well,

745
00:40:14,321 --> 00:40:19,300
why don't I knew Ron so much that I
think, I don't know. I love singing sucks.

746
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:21,600
Yeah.
I don't like it where they're changing.

747
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,720
I mean pit random like what
you like. It's okay. You know?

748
00:40:25,721 --> 00:40:29,080
I'm not saying that I'm right and you're
wrong. I'm saying is I think it sucks.

749
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:33,940
I don't like it. Yeah. I think that,
uh, that style is I, yeah, yeah, yeah.

750
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:38,950
It's like you just show him what
you can do with your voice, right?

751
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:43,750
Like what does that girl named Natalie?
A what the fuck's her name is singer.

752
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:48,400
Uh, God dammit, I need to talk.
She's got a beautiful, yes, Nicole.

753
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:53,800
She dumb. I'll look it up on iTunes right
here. She does it, but when she does it,

754
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,170
she does it like it's like she's
not doing it like, like to try to,

755
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,180
just to try to make the,
hearing her voice sound differently.

756
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:04,150
She's expressing herself a certain way.

757
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:07,070
I think you should think about the
words of the song and what your end,

758
00:41:07,071 --> 00:41:11,440
if it accentuates the message of
the song then Dylan, Nelly Furtado,

759
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:16,120
that's her name. Yeah. Like
put on that song. I'm like a
bird. Put it on. Just do it.

760
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,670
Gives a shit.
It's fucking fuck serious.

761
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:23,380
I want to hear this God damn song cause
it's interesting we have to edit this

762
00:41:23,381 --> 00:41:27,430
out. I'm sure they have some
sort of intern system to get,

763
00:41:27,431 --> 00:41:28,930
find someone who can go,
hey dude,

764
00:41:28,931 --> 00:41:33,100
there's some songs up in this
bitch once you go find them. Yeah.

765
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:40,220
But my point is that there's a difference
between someone who's got a beautiful

766
00:41:40,221 --> 00:41:42,760
voice and someone's got a beautiful
voice and they have to fucking show for

767
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:43,610
buddy.
You know,

768
00:41:43,611 --> 00:41:47,320
it's like a Dude Who's a
all oiled up wearing a tank
top and walking around town.

769
00:41:47,321 --> 00:41:50,670
So like, all right, dude, I know you work
out. Okay. It's 30 degrees out. Well,

770
00:41:50,671 --> 00:41:54,350
I got a tank top on it. Okay. Can you
fucking dummy with your stupid voice?

771
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:56,543
Yeah,

772
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:04,590
you got something there. What do you
got today? You would think that someone,

773
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:05,011
you know,

774
00:42:05,011 --> 00:42:08,520
it's like a Steven Pressfield in the war
of art talking about professionals and

775
00:42:08,521 --> 00:42:11,690
not professionals, but not
professional thing to do. Absolutely.

776
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:16,110
Just have to overdo something to show
what you're capable of. You know?

777
00:42:16,111 --> 00:42:19,730
It's like fashion should show up, do
the job, do it as good as you can.

778
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,250
And it's like somebody wants their
guitar solo in no matter what,

779
00:42:23,251 --> 00:42:25,290
even if the song. All right. All right.

780
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:28,360
And there's a lot of that out there
because there's the guitar Solos.

781
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:31,760
What gets you all that sweet pussy?
It's just me. There's a spotlight on

782
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:36,350
me. I had that guitar and I just feel
it like this and this girl's voices.

783
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:41,070
This girl has a gorgeous voice.
Yeah,

784
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,910
she's a pretty girl. And when she
sings though, like you can you,

785
00:42:45,911 --> 00:42:48,320
you know that she's got
this incredible range,

786
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,230
but she's not using it to be a Douche.

787
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:54,100
She's using it like she's
trying to make the songwriter

788
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:57,460
turned out fine.

789
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:03,070
Okay.

790
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:05,140
God, man, that's
beautiful. Listen to this.

791
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:10,770
[inaudible] mom and baby [inaudible].

792
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:23,990
She sees bird
thinking about a burden.

793
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:25,390
You don't understand.

794
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:30,950
It's real man.
It's,

795
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:34,830
it's not just flashy showbizzy horse shit.

796
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,390
And then once she does that, you know, she
stretches it out, but it makes sense. No,

797
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:46,250
there's fucking professional.
Are you listening, Christina?

798
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:51,140
Put the fucking donuts down and go
running. I'm going to get this together.

799
00:43:51,141 --> 00:43:54,020
Hooker. It's not too
late. It's not too late.

800
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:58,320
What do you 30 okay. Pull it
together. Whore. I'll date. Yeah.

801
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:01,660
Brian will fuck up your life
more than food ever could.

802
00:44:01,661 --> 00:44:04,410
And I could look like you're Jewish.
You will be so stressed out.

803
00:44:04,411 --> 00:44:06,150
You will lose massive amounts of weight.

804
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,370
I shouldn't have called her a whore that
was searching for a word. That's right.

805
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:12,720
I meant hooker, but I'd already said it.
I bet she's awesome to hang out with.

806
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:15,840
We call check hooker and it's okay. I like
shut up hooker, he just playing around.

807
00:44:15,841 --> 00:44:19,050
But you say shut up whore and you're
like, Hey, what are you doing? Hookers?

808
00:44:19,051 --> 00:44:21,930
Like a funny word,
but it's for the fucking same thing.

809
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:25,300
I girls call each other hook here all
the time. And it's funny, you know I,

810
00:44:25,301 --> 00:44:28,230
I would call, he's always calling
people hooker like in the audience too.

811
00:44:28,231 --> 00:44:31,020
Like someone yells in, I'm like,
shut up poker. Sit the fuck.

812
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,090
But it doesn't really mean whore. You
know, it means like freak bitch, you know,

813
00:44:36,091 --> 00:44:40,010
like sit the fuck down. You
whack your broad, you know,
you know what I mean? Right.

814
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:44,400
But whore. So I Apologize Christina,
don't let me make you eat more.

815
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:48,630
Don't let me make you run to that fucking
cupboard and start pulling out cookies.

816
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:51,870
And if you listen this podcast and you
probably don't, let's be realistic,

817
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:57,810
but you never know man. Never now. I mean
it is on the Internet, but if you listen,

818
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,640
we're just fucking around,
right? And don't get upset,

819
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:04,140
but it couldn't be funny if it wasn't
true. Okay, we're going to deal,

820
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:06,180
we all got to deal with our own
little shortcomings in this life.

821
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,870
And you like food, you don't like to work
out. We need to fucking rotate. Those,

822
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:15,200
need to rotate those secrets. What's, uh,
what's your new business to about? It's,

823
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:18,340
it's open now. Right? Last time you
were on here, it wasn't open to,

824
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:21,840
you're talking about, it was just
about to start. So what is it?

825
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:25,800
So I basically took, um, a
need that I had, you know,

826
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:30,760
I'm a guy who parties hard, works
hard, works out hard and um,

827
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:36,720
[inaudible] you don't
always sleep and you know,

828
00:45:36,721 --> 00:45:39,650
like on most people's counter, you
know, I just saw your counter Joe.

829
00:45:39,651 --> 00:45:41,670
There's tons of supplements like a ton.

830
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:43,730
Like you have to take a bunch
of different stuff. Yeah.

831
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:47,270
Turn it off and put it all
together. So what I created was, um,

832
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:52,080
basically a conglomeration of the best
combination of ingredients I could and

833
00:45:52,081 --> 00:45:54,720
put it in two pills,
two different types of formulas.

834
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:59,310
So one formula as an antioxidant vitality
formula gives you a ton of energy

835
00:45:59,311 --> 00:46:02,430
without the caffeine, which further
dehydrates you, causes bad shit.

836
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:05,430
And your body and starts eliminating
the free radicals that are coming in.

837
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:09,630
So you actually feel good and have
more energy as you're going out. Um,

838
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:12,360
the other one. And so that's for
like during a party or pre party.

839
00:46:12,361 --> 00:46:14,380
It's actually super good
for working out too. Um,

840
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:17,340
cause it just makes you feel better
and it doesn't get you all wired.

841
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:21,730
That's the day dayquil. Yeah,
that's basically all it's
called Rolando. Rolando.

842
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:26,820
And what's the name of your company on it?
Labs. And it was on@labs.com on it.com.

843
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:31,830
O n n I t. Dot. Go. And the other
ones for the learning it. O N N,

844
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:36,350
double n O. U. Oh, that's
confusing. Who's o? N I T.

845
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:39,350
I dunno. Some mother fuckers
owning your business, man.

846
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,480
So that's something we need to get
another website. That ain't gonna work.

847
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:45,720
It's gonna fuck people up.
Double. That double ends a mess.

848
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:47,010
That's going to remember you're gonna,

849
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,520
you're gonna lose money from that double
line. Did you try to do, to try on it?

850
00:46:50,521 --> 00:46:53,640
labs.com, uh, with one
end? I liked the devil.

851
00:46:53,641 --> 00:46:57,690
Well because I don't want it to be too
literal, you know, like on it, you just,

852
00:46:58,310 --> 00:47:01,480
it's just the [inaudible] was
like Yahoo money. I hate money,

853
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:06,780
but so then there's like a Jewish manager
money, Charles, if you hate money.

854
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:10,480
So I manage her, says, oh, well we
did this, uh, the show and um, uh,

855
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:13,650
in Vegas this weekend and uh,
well I shouldn't even talk about this.

856
00:47:13,651 --> 00:47:17,370
He's going to get mad if I talk about
that. What? I can't say anything. Oh,

857
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:21,480
I gotta I gotta pull out
on it labs. So N, N I t,

858
00:47:21,481 --> 00:47:25,290
so it's [inaudible] dot com and all
this stuff's available right now for

859
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:30,370
[inaudible]. So shit that kills hangovers
should that while, yes, and the recovery

860
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:32,800
formula is more focused on your
brain because if you're not sleeping,

861
00:47:32,801 --> 00:47:36,100
if you're partying, doing anything, you're
not restoring your Serotonin, oxytocin,

862
00:47:36,101 --> 00:47:39,370
dopamine, and all of the brain chemicals
get restored during deep sleep.

863
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:41,650
If you're boozed up or if
your party and your case,

864
00:47:41,651 --> 00:47:44,230
your store those with pills or just
help it a little bit, you can help.

865
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:48,760
You can help it quite a bit because a
five HTP is the building direct precursor

866
00:47:48,761 --> 00:47:52,720
to Serotonin and when combined with B
six which is the catalyst which converts

867
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:57,010
five HTP to Serotonin, you can actually
start rebuilding serotonin way faster.

868
00:47:57,050 --> 00:48:00,340
Otherwise it would take weeks to rebuild
but going blast out your serotonin.

869
00:48:00,341 --> 00:48:03,400
You have the five HTP with the vitamin B,
six pyridoxine,

870
00:48:03,401 --> 00:48:05,980
then you can actually recover
your serotonin faster.

871
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:10,720
So that's why people feel bummed out after
having slept and are they get cranky.

872
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,120
This would be perfect for like
if you're dancing with Molly

873
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:20,170
prophetically, if you were doing
ecstasy or do some kind of drug,

874
00:48:20,171 --> 00:48:22,630
that'd be perfect for that.
Right. Dancing with Molly,

875
00:48:22,631 --> 00:48:25,430
you talking about there's a type
of exercise in called Molly, right?

876
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,770
Pure fat and yeah,

877
00:48:26,771 --> 00:48:29,890
I mean obviously the product would work
extremely well for that because not only

878
00:48:29,891 --> 00:48:31,090
is it restoring your Serotonin,

879
00:48:31,091 --> 00:48:34,420
which is actually what makes you feel
good is the ecstasy releases too much

880
00:48:34,421 --> 00:48:36,220
serotonin in your body.
Also,

881
00:48:36,221 --> 00:48:39,790
the other formulas are going to start
mitigating the neuro toxicity associated

882
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:43,180
with keeping your body at that kind of
high level of reverberation where all

883
00:48:43,181 --> 00:48:47,350
your ht transmitters are just all blocked
up and the Serotonin is running wild.

884
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:50,800
It makes me feel great, but it's doing
some, it's doing a little bit of damage,

885
00:48:50,801 --> 00:48:55,120
not like the, the f you know, like the
studies that said it fries your brain.

886
00:48:56,610 --> 00:48:58,030
What is,
what does it do?

887
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,700
Like the studies that say that
ecstasy was called regrained. Yeah,

888
00:49:00,701 --> 00:49:04,060
those were actually, it was mixed
with methamphetamines. Okay.

889
00:49:04,061 --> 00:49:07,960
So it was a bad sample that they
were using and methamphetamines,

890
00:49:07,961 --> 00:49:11,500
does that show up in your brain? Well,
that's a kind of a metaphorical way,

891
00:49:11,501 --> 00:49:16,090
but it does serious, serious damage. Um,
you know, ecstasy from what you know,

892
00:49:16,091 --> 00:49:19,210
there's actually a big study by Rick
Strassman now on post traumatic stress for

893
00:49:19,211 --> 00:49:22,930
Mtma. Really? And Yeah.
Soldiers coming back from the
war, they're all tweaked out.

894
00:49:22,931 --> 00:49:23,950
They can't trust anything.

895
00:49:23,951 --> 00:49:27,220
They're shaken and bombs are going off
in their head when they hear something

896
00:49:27,221 --> 00:49:31,660
slam on a table. The MVMA, well pure
Mgma, I shouldn't call it ecstasy,

897
00:49:31,661 --> 00:49:34,330
that's kind of the street name
for the drug, but the pure Mbma,

898
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:38,860
it creates an environment where you're
trusting and loving of the universe again.

899
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:43,330
And so they're able to go relive
some of these things and say, okay,

900
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:46,660
that was war. But you know what?
This isn't more like this is,

901
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:49,210
this is life and life is good.
There's beauty in this life.

902
00:49:49,211 --> 00:49:52,240
And really with some of the
studies coming back, they just did,

903
00:49:52,241 --> 00:49:55,330
I think a 20 person study got
the results done through maps,

904
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,770
maps.org and a great,

905
00:49:57,810 --> 00:50:02,810
which is the center for
psychedelic studies running
at what does map stand for?

906
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,260
Mol Multidisciplinary,

907
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:09,250
something like studies
and Multidisciplinary
Association, Psycho study,

908
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:12,550
something like that. Um, but yeah,
great study that came back. But,

909
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:15,700
but what ecstasy we'll do is
obviously it's very dehydrating.

910
00:50:15,701 --> 00:50:18,220
So you don't wouldn't want to take any
caffeine or anything like that because

911
00:50:18,221 --> 00:50:21,010
your body's trying to get rid of
it. Uh, just like any drug you take,

912
00:50:21,011 --> 00:50:21,910
your body's trying to do that.

913
00:50:21,911 --> 00:50:24,610
And when your body is trying to get
rid of something, you get dehydrated.

914
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,160
It's also has some neuro
toxicity associated.

915
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,740
Mean if you're going to be in that level
of high reverberation, free radicals,

916
00:50:30,741 --> 00:50:34,520
they're gonna just going to be peeling
out of your body. So really? Yeah. Yeah.

917
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:37,370
I mean that's what, it's that stress.
It's that kind of stress that's,

918
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:41,840
that's causing, you know, you learn
all this stuff. Did some research,

919
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:43,050
did some research on it.
You know,

920
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:46,700
I mean obviously the psychedelic
research and a lot of this is,

921
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:48,620
is up my alley plus with the supplements,

922
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:52,300
just dealing with the formulas
that I have and seeing kind of the,

923
00:50:52,301 --> 00:50:53,001
the damage did,

924
00:50:53,001 --> 00:50:56,450
a lot of people in my generation are going
through who are partying hard and you

925
00:50:56,451 --> 00:50:58,850
know, some of them are doing
drugs. I'm not advocating doing it,

926
00:50:58,851 --> 00:51:02,090
but a lot of people are doing it and
they're doing it in a way that's really

927
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:05,870
damaging their ability to move
on with their life and you know,

928
00:51:05,871 --> 00:51:08,990
handle business as well as
they should. So, you know,

929
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:11,600
while these forms aren't
designed specifically for that,

930
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:14,690
they do obviously really
help because it's just like,

931
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:18,290
that's like the ultimate level of,
of putting a tax on your body.

932
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:21,640
You're partying with drugs, it's like
takes it to the other levels. So,

933
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:26,510
so the rollover formula has
five HTP directly converts
to Serotonin, Tryptophan,

934
00:51:26,511 --> 00:51:29,300
which is actually the
building block of five HTP.

935
00:51:29,301 --> 00:51:32,720
So it's more like a time release. Also
at the same thing. It's in thanksgiving.

936
00:51:32,721 --> 00:51:34,410
Turkey makes you kind of sleepy,

937
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:37,550
kind of brings you down from any
of your big high experiences.

938
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:40,310
I lived in ecstasy once and I
decided right after I did it.

939
00:51:40,311 --> 00:51:44,450
This is probably not a good thing to
do. Yeah, I felt terrible the next day.

940
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,870
You need the recovery for me,
right? I need the whole block.

941
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:49,190
There's a couple things happening.

942
00:51:49,191 --> 00:51:52,250
You have neuro toxicity built up and
you have low serotonin from Watson,

943
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:57,260
from what's happened. So, um, you know,
it can make you feel, yeah, totally.

944
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:00,080
I want to try this stuff too. Um,
I think it's fascinating. This a,

945
00:52:00,081 --> 00:52:02,460
there's a whole new area of,
um,

946
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:07,630
interest these days and that's a mind
chemicals like mind vitamins would they

947
00:52:08,301 --> 00:52:12,800
call nootropics a bunch of
different substances that
Incruse Cree circulation to

948
00:52:12,801 --> 00:52:16,970
certain areas of the brain increase
the workload workload rather of certain

949
00:52:16,971 --> 00:52:20,170
areas. I'd love that stuff. I
think it's so, so amazing. Yeah.

950
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,030
So that people have figured out
how to do that. You know, it's,

951
00:52:23,031 --> 00:52:27,020
it's really amazing how many different
substances on this earth interact with

952
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:29,480
the human body.
Like I gave you guys some Stevia.

953
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:33,330
We have coffee here and instead of
sugar we have Stevia. And Stevia is,

954
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:36,560
it's like this natural sweetener that
doesn't have any calories and it doesn't

955
00:52:36,561 --> 00:52:41,270
fuck you up and it doesn't. Yep. Jack,
your glucose levels are, it's really,

956
00:52:41,271 --> 00:52:45,270
yeah. It's really good. Yeah. Dissolves
in, dissolves in a cup of green tea that,

957
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:48,830
yeah. Yeah. And it's, uh, it's,
it's interesting, you know,

958
00:52:48,831 --> 00:52:51,890
that there's all these different
things like caffeine, you know,

959
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:55,250
there's things that jack up your, you
know, your chemistry and get you going.

960
00:52:55,550 --> 00:52:57,350
Like it's amazing how
many different things are.

961
00:52:57,351 --> 00:53:01,370
And what's also very interesting is that
the lobbies that try and block these

962
00:53:01,371 --> 00:53:02,204
things.
Yeah.

963
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:05,370
Yeah. You know, I don't
know that my facts exactly,

964
00:53:05,371 --> 00:53:09,060
but I know that the sugar lobby
put up a big stink about Stevia,

965
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:12,150
like a big stink, I'm sure
created some, created some issues.

966
00:53:12,151 --> 00:53:15,180
Like I don't think like Coca Cola
and other countries, diet coke,

967
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:18,380
he uses Stevia, but in
really mess. Yeah. Um,

968
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:23,220
coke 99% sure that coke uses Steven.
I know there are some sodas that use it.

969
00:53:23,221 --> 00:53:25,020
I definitely, but then,
but they don't use it here.

970
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:27,180
The U s just because there's
such a stink about it.

971
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,170
You know what the Hillary
Clinton lobby's done.

972
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:33,720
Hillary Clinton was asked yesterday about,
let me find the article so I can, uh,

973
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:37,440
cause it's so ridiculous. It just shows
what the fuck is wrong with this country.

974
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:39,330
Yeah.

975
00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:41,040
Yeah.
Mexican Coca Cola is in bottle.

976
00:53:41,041 --> 00:53:44,370
You can buy out in La and they use
real cane sugar is still in Mexico.

977
00:53:44,371 --> 00:53:47,580
So we you have like a coke in the bottle
out front and here in la it's so weird

978
00:53:47,581 --> 00:53:50,650
tasting quick cause it kinda remember
you kind of remember as a kid drinking

979
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,170
like here's what I'm,

980
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:53,660
here's what Hillary Clinton said.

981
00:53:53,661 --> 00:53:57,170
They were talking to her about the war
in Mexico and drugs and this just goes to

982
00:53:57,171 --> 00:54:00,020
show you how fucked up the drug
lobbyist in this country are in the

983
00:54:00,021 --> 00:54:02,720
pharmaceutical lobbyists and
how much influence they have.

984
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:06,080
We can't legalize drugs because
there's just too much money in it.

985
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:10,730
That's what she said. This
is an exact quote. You know,

986
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:15,200
I hate to say a debate. I hear it in
my country, it's not likely to work.

987
00:54:15,201 --> 00:54:16,460
There's just too much money in it.

988
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:19,490
I don't think that you can legalize
small amounts for possession,

989
00:54:19,491 --> 00:54:22,670
but those who are making so much money
selling, they have to be stopped.

990
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:27,440
Oh you mean like pharmaceutical
companies pushing Oxycontin's in Florida?

991
00:54:27,441 --> 00:54:30,980
Like they're fucking kit kats. Is
that what you mean? It's so dirty.

992
00:54:30,981 --> 00:54:34,330
How they do it too. Like even El
Tryptophan, Tryptophan is, you know,

993
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:37,700
it's going to boost your serotonin.
A lot of those drugs, Prozac, Paxil,

994
00:54:37,701 --> 00:54:40,040
all these things,
they fall in a category called Ssri,

995
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:42,500
selective Serotonin reuptake inhibitors,

996
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:46,590
and all of those drugs are basically
operating on your serotonin mechanism,

997
00:54:46,591 --> 00:54:50,330
giving you more serotonin. Well,
Tryptophan five HTP does is naturally,

998
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:54,800
they gives one bad batch of Al Tryptophan
that came in from Japan. I was tainted.

999
00:54:54,801 --> 00:54:58,430
It had some bacteria that grew in it,
like it could happen to fucking vitamin C,

1000
00:54:58,550 --> 00:54:59,240
whatever.

1001
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:04,040
They logged on to that and just started
pounding the FDA and the FDA outlawed it

1002
00:55:04,041 --> 00:55:07,880
for like 10 12 years until finally
people were like, this is ridiculous.

1003
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:10,790
Stuff helps you relax, helps
you sleep, build serotonin.

1004
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:13,850
But the drug lobbies have just huge power.
You know what I mean?

1005
00:55:13,851 --> 00:55:15,340
Huge power to be able to alter.

1006
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:19,310
It's incredible that she
would have answered this
that way without the obvious.

1007
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:23,300
But obviously there's a lot of other
drugs that are legal in this country,

1008
00:55:23,301 --> 00:55:26,300
like alcohol and tobacco. The
cause a lot of damage. I mean,

1009
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:29,210
they don't even look at the whole
picture when they're answering.

1010
00:55:29,211 --> 00:55:32,060
They're so used to people not
completely questioning them.

1011
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:34,850
You're right there fellow. Yeah, there's
something going on with their mix.

1012
00:55:34,851 --> 00:55:38,270
They started echoing or something.
It there's, there's, there's some,

1013
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:43,130
there's an arrogance to these type
of answers. You know, that you're,

1014
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,920
you're supposed to be the person with
the answers. Someone asks you a question,

1015
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:48,170
here's your answer.
And you know,

1016
00:55:48,171 --> 00:55:52,160
logically that this answer is ridiculous
because it discounts all the money that

1017
00:55:52,161 --> 00:55:54,500
you get from drug companies,
from pharmaceutical companies.

1018
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:57,170
What about all the money you get from
alcohol companies and tobacco companies

1019
00:55:57,171 --> 00:56:00,440
would know. What about all that
money? Where, where is that? Would it,

1020
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:02,690
how does that factor into
your thing? Well, it doesn't,

1021
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:07,700
they just stopped the conversation
and it's like, it's, it's a sickness.

1022
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:09,440
It's a sickness that we allowed this.

1023
00:56:09,470 --> 00:56:13,550
It's a sickness that politicians can say
retarded shit like that and not just be

1024
00:56:13,551 --> 00:56:16,550
blasted all over the newest
were being hypocrites. I mean,

1025
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:20,090
what they should have on CNN
tonight is Hillary Clinton's quote.

1026
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:23,830
And then all the fucking money she got
when she was running for how much of it

1027
00:56:23,831 --> 00:56:24,340
is connected

1028
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:27,190
to pharmaceutical companies and how
much of it was connected to alcohol

1029
00:56:27,191 --> 00:56:30,730
companies and back or yeah. How much
where's the lobbyists were, were,

1030
00:56:30,731 --> 00:56:33,640
who's paying them? Well, you know,
what is she voted for in the past?

1031
00:56:33,641 --> 00:56:37,960
What does she tried to keep legal, you
know, come on man, you fucking criminals.

1032
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:41,950
You dirty, stinky, corrupt
criminals. Every one of you fucks.

1033
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:45,010
I'm trying not screaming in the streets.
You're a fucking crook.

1034
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:48,490
I've gotten pretty fired up on
the same topic recently. And um,

1035
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:52,330
I just got a found a video from
Milton Friedman who is a pretty famous

1036
00:56:52,331 --> 00:56:55,720
libertarian and economist. Um,
and he was actually talking,

1037
00:56:55,721 --> 00:56:59,440
it's just a real breath of fresh air to
listen to him cause he's quoting John

1038
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:03,340
Stuart Mill, the philosopher
basically saying like, the only right,

1039
00:57:03,341 --> 00:57:07,120
the government has to impose on our
freedom is if we're hurting somebody else.

1040
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:11,020
Like yeah, the bottom line period.
Like no other, no other statements.

1041
00:57:11,021 --> 00:57:13,030
And the video that actually
have on my site is,

1042
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:17,230
is a Milton Friedman talking about
seatbelt and helmet laws and he's saying,

1043
00:57:17,231 --> 00:57:19,240
I mean he's saying like
this was a litmus test,

1044
00:57:19,241 --> 00:57:23,200
the seatbelt and helmet laws of the
government imposing their will upon people

1045
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:26,530
and nobody really cares that much about
those laws. But he's like, this is,

1046
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:30,250
this is a sign of what they're doing.
They're saying they know better than you,

1047
00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:32,830
what's good for you and they're
going to make you do this. He said,

1048
00:57:32,831 --> 00:57:36,130
it's your fully your right to where it
should be full of your right to wear it.

1049
00:57:36,131 --> 00:57:39,790
No helmet on your, on your motorcycle.
Like it's not going to hurt anybody else.

1050
00:57:39,791 --> 00:57:41,560
Yeah, it's a stupid risk.
You shouldn't do it.

1051
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:43,420
It's not advocating wearing no helmets,

1052
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:46,900
but that's your right and the government
has no fucking business right telling

1053
00:57:46,901 --> 00:57:47,350
you otherwise.

1054
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:50,800
It's like you telling Ryan that he has
to wear a helmet and if he doesn't,

1055
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:52,450
you're going to lock him in a cage.
Yeah.

1056
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:55,350
No difference between you and
the government. I mean, you know,

1057
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:58,900
other than the fact that supposedly
the government is supposedly elected to

1058
00:57:58,901 --> 00:58:03,100
represent you, which gets very
true. Questionable. It's very,

1059
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:08,140
very fucking gross. Yeah. God dammit. But
you know, the, the other point is too,

1060
00:58:08,141 --> 00:58:12,850
that if you're, if you create all of
these laws that people find is immoral,

1061
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:15,070
you know,
they begin to distrust the whole system.

1062
00:58:15,071 --> 00:58:16,930
Like you have to follow these laws.

1063
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:21,370
Like people don't look at police as they
should. Like police should be saviors,

1064
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:24,520
you know, like, oh, thank God the
police are here. Right? You know,

1065
00:58:24,521 --> 00:58:28,330
you're having a party, everybody's happy.
Things are good. You're like, oh fuck,

1066
00:58:28,331 --> 00:58:30,460
there's a fucking police outside.
You know,

1067
00:58:30,461 --> 00:58:32,620
it's like when you create
a system like that,

1068
00:58:32,621 --> 00:58:34,120
that's when things get fucking tracked.

1069
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:38,650
There's a cop in Los Angeles that a claim
to have gotten shot outside of school.

1070
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:42,090
Um, and uh, he was, uh, apparently, uh,

1071
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:45,790
bullshit in the entire time and they went
this massive manhunt looking for this

1072
00:58:45,791 --> 00:58:50,170
guy who shot the cop and
he gave a description and
everything white male with a

1073
00:58:50,171 --> 00:58:53,470
fucking gray ponytail. You know, you think
it's some crazy biker type character,

1074
00:58:53,471 --> 00:58:56,480
right? Turns out it was just
complete fabrication. Scott.

1075
00:58:56,650 --> 00:59:00,370
Now what did he shoot himself? I don't
know or didn't invite investigating.

1076
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:03,040
They're investigating. So I don't think
they've made an official statement.

1077
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:06,880
But the official statement is that the
cop has admitted that he lied and said no

1078
00:59:06,881 --> 00:59:09,580
one really shot him.
So what the fuck man?

1079
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:14,730
And they apparently cost $500,000 for
this manhunt and that's only what it costs

1080
00:59:15,581 --> 00:59:16,001
the state.

1081
00:59:16,001 --> 00:59:20,260
Cause I was trapped in that traffic and
it was like an hour and a half, you know,

1082
00:59:20,261 --> 00:59:22,000
I'm out of my schedule for the next

1083
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:23,960
right. That's a good point,
right? How many people lost money?

1084
00:59:23,961 --> 00:59:26,490
How many deals didn't get closed?
How many things didn't it?

1085
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:30,440
Eventually you're going to be able to have
something in your car just like a lot.

1086
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:34,610
I talk shit on your iPhone where if you're
stuck in traffic and you're going to

1087
00:59:34,611 --> 00:59:37,910
be able to press a button and have a
fucking direct conference video call with

1088
00:59:37,911 --> 00:59:40,910
people, you know they're going to be right
there looking right at you. You know,

1089
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:44,660
like, so you can have a meeting in your
car. Yeah. It should be now auditions.

1090
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:47,510
Why not man fucking love
having calls in my car, man.

1091
00:59:47,511 --> 00:59:49,700
That's the number one reason
why I went to Verizon.

1092
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:53,870
I went to Verizon over 18 t was cause
when I had the iPhone and I fucking drive

1093
00:59:53,871 --> 00:59:56,750
around, man, my phone just would cut off
left and right and it would piss me off.

1094
00:59:56,750 --> 01:00:01,100
It would drive me nuts. Yeah. I T and t is
bad here. Fucking almost never cuts off,

1095
01:00:01,101 --> 01:00:05,360
man. It's amazing. I mean it's, it's
like, it's so much better. It's not,

1096
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:10,060
it's not 20% better, 30% better.
It's like 50 or 60% better. You know,

1097
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:12,140
like 18 t was just cutting out everywhere.

1098
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,270
The Verizon might fuck up
every now and then. You know,

1099
01:00:14,271 --> 01:00:17,060
he'd go through some weird hilly area
or something where there's no signal

1100
01:00:17,061 --> 01:00:18,740
period, but, uh, they,

1101
01:00:18,741 --> 01:00:22,250
it just fucking 18 t was brutal and not
my car when I get in and it's got that

1102
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:25,460
Bluetooth thing where it syncs up and
then the voice comes through the speakers.

1103
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:28,130
So he can have some pretty
cool conversations and
you're not taking your hands

1104
01:00:28,131 --> 01:00:31,200
off the wheel. It's just like someone's in
the car with you. You know, like you're,

1105
01:00:31,201 --> 01:00:34,610
you're having a fun car. It makes driving
so much more interesting by herself,

1106
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:37,190
but fucking 18 teach can't pull it off.

1107
01:00:37,270 --> 01:00:42,270
Supposedly Verizon with this new iPhone
is actually a teetering your download

1108
01:00:42,491 --> 01:00:45,130
speeds if because they're trying.
That's how they're trying to,

1109
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:49,760
I guess the regulating it. Yeah.
Yeah. What is staggering? Staggering.

1110
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:53,290
Yes. Whatever the word is. If you,
if they find out that you use a lot,

1111
01:00:53,291 --> 01:00:56,350
they're going to cut your shit down
and then like you'll have like half the

1112
01:00:56,351 --> 01:00:57,540
download speed or whatever.

1113
01:00:57,541 --> 01:01:00,340
A fraction of the downloads for you
that you had before. That's unknowing.

1114
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:02,900
It is annoying. We know.
What else is annoying though.

1115
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:06,400
It's a world phone and that they
don't have that part activated. Yeah.

1116
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:09,580
Cause I have a blackberry with Verizon.
I've thought about using the iPhone with,

1117
01:01:09,581 --> 01:01:11,380
for Verizon,
but you know the UFC,

1118
01:01:11,381 --> 01:01:13,900
I'm always traveling to England
and traveling around the world.

1119
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:17,530
I got to go to Australia in a couple of
weeks. I couldn't deal with, you know,

1120
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:20,710
having no phone over there, that would
annoy the shit out of me, you know?

1121
01:01:20,711 --> 01:01:21,580
But they don't have anything.
You

1122
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:23,260
think that,
that they're going to activate it later?

1123
01:01:23,261 --> 01:01:25,390
Maybe it's just something that they're
waiting on apple to get, you know,

1124
01:01:25,391 --> 01:01:28,960
like the software part put in there
somehow. I don't know what the fuck it is,

1125
01:01:28,961 --> 01:01:31,900
man. It's kind of annoying. Yeah, it
seems weird that it's in the phone,

1126
01:01:31,901 --> 01:01:34,810
but you can't use it. It makes
no sense at all. Right. Chris,

1127
01:01:34,811 --> 01:01:37,690
we can hear your European man.
It's not being as your waterfall.

1128
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:41,920
They put doors on bathrooms for a reason.
What didn't you want to talk,

1129
01:01:42,070 --> 01:01:46,290
talk about in Vegas now? Can I tell you
what happened to me in Vegas? Yeah, yeah.

1130
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:49,180
Tell me about the hooker
story. Oops, sorry. Yeah,

1131
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:54,100
I forgot. I forgot that.
That was the whole story.

1132
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,670
That was what was funny about it.
I just tell you the story. Anyway,

1133
01:01:56,680 --> 01:02:00,000
so we were out. This is what happens. Let
me tell you something. What happens? Um,

1134
01:02:00,090 --> 01:02:02,830
we were all drunk and it was three o'clock
in the morning or whatever the fuck

1135
01:02:02,831 --> 01:02:04,360
it was.
I'm laying in my hotel room,

1136
01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:08,290
conked out and my phone starts
vibrating and it's Brian. Yeah.

1137
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:11,590
And so what happened to me is we all
separated after the bars and we, you know,

1138
01:02:11,591 --> 01:02:14,530
went to our separate hotel or
separate elevators or whatever.

1139
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:17,530
So I get in an elevator
and right before it closes,

1140
01:02:17,531 --> 01:02:20,700
this girl does like the arm thing that
gets to get in the elevator. So I'm like,

1141
01:02:20,701 --> 01:02:24,690
oh hey. She was like this girl that looked
just like Kim Kardashian a little bit.

1142
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:28,710
You'll have some taller than me
fucking wearing a nice dress like tan.

1143
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:33,510
Just look really like rich, I guess.
And just top top of the line shelf.

1144
01:02:33,511 --> 01:02:35,040
Girl.
I have to comment real quick,

1145
01:02:35,041 --> 01:02:39,040
how many girls say they look like
Kim Kardashian on like Facebook dot.

1146
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:42,810
Look that Kim Carter is that if it's,
don't I look like good. So I uh,

1147
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:47,690
I hit 10 that was on floor 10 and she
hit nine. Then she starts texting and,

1148
01:02:47,691 --> 01:02:49,230
and just not paying attention.

1149
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:51,660
I was just looking at her
tits wasn't paying attention.

1150
01:02:51,661 --> 01:02:55,650
She the door open and shut and then right
when it was shutting, she goes, Oh fuck.

1151
01:02:55,651 --> 01:02:59,370
I miss my floor. And I just
jokingly, because I was so wasted,

1152
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:03,990
I had the balls of this. I jokingly said,
you can crash in my room. And she goes,

1153
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:07,760
she looks at me for like a couple
seconds goes, okay. And then we,

1154
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:10,690
the elevator door opens and I'm like in
shock. I'm like, she's not, you know,

1155
01:03:10,770 --> 01:03:14,490
she's fucking with me. I
get out the other, she just
falls me out. I had my door,

1156
01:03:14,570 --> 01:03:17,460
my, my room was right down
there, started walking.

1157
01:03:17,461 --> 01:03:19,770
She's just falling and we're not talking,
we're not saying anything.

1158
01:03:19,770 --> 01:03:22,740
I just look over at her, I'm
smiling, she's like smiling at me.

1159
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:27,600
And then I opened my door up,
the door opens, she shuts,

1160
01:03:27,630 --> 01:03:30,780
she fucking immediately throw it,
pushes me against a wall, grabs my dick,

1161
01:03:30,781 --> 01:03:33,840
starts making out with me just for like
a good minute or what's going through

1162
01:03:33,841 --> 01:03:38,070
your head right at that point? Like, don't
fuck this up. Don't fuck this up. Fuck,

1163
01:03:38,071 --> 01:03:40,260
yeah. Fuck yeah, this is awesome.

1164
01:03:40,261 --> 01:03:43,320
I'm making out with a girl and then I
have to be on my tippy toes to make out

1165
01:03:43,321 --> 01:03:47,550
with, uh, and then she goes thousand
dollars if you want to play.

1166
01:03:48,510 --> 01:03:52,350
And I was like, oh your, I
thought you were a real girl

1167
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:57,960
and that true. Yeah, it's going
to bring, when I said, I'm
like, oh, that sounded bad,

1168
01:03:57,961 --> 01:04:01,530
but uh, and then she goes, no
honey, no, no. And she goes,
all right, that's cool. Well,

1169
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:04,470
and I'm like, Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so
sorry. I thought you were just saying,

1170
01:04:04,471 --> 01:04:07,740
you know, a real girl. And then she
goes, no problem. And then she goes,

1171
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:09,480
here's one for the road
or something like that.

1172
01:04:09,481 --> 01:04:12,120
And then she just started making out
with me again and I'm thinking like,

1173
01:04:12,121 --> 01:04:14,730
do I pay her five bucks for that?
And then I'm also thinking,

1174
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:18,120
I'm also thinking like thousand dollar
hooker. That's like top grade hooker.

1175
01:04:18,121 --> 01:04:21,630
That's not like a normal Mandalay
bay hooker. Right. That's like a,

1176
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:23,560
that's like Charlie Sheen Hooker.
Right.

1177
01:04:23,561 --> 01:04:26,550
It could have easily been her first time
being a hooker and she's just a crazy

1178
01:04:26,551 --> 01:04:29,220
bitch. Right? I mean she just couldn't
be crude. So fucking hot though.

1179
01:04:29,221 --> 01:04:32,580
I think she was just like high class
one that happened to be just got done

1180
01:04:32,581 --> 01:04:33,690
blowing Jay z and,

1181
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:37,530
and you know what's crazy is hurting her
mouth tastes like red bull and socks.

1182
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:41,070
And I remember thinking that like,
like wow, she just drink a red bull.

1183
01:04:41,071 --> 01:04:45,730
And she was on a flip there
blowing from there. And then,

1184
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:48,670
and then after that happened
I called Joe and I'm like,

1185
01:04:48,671 --> 01:04:50,520
I can't believe this happened.
And then I'm thinking like,

1186
01:04:50,610 --> 01:04:53,640
do I like run down the hall and
tell her like, hey, after you work,

1187
01:04:53,641 --> 01:04:55,930
if you want to just, you know,
spoon later or something like that,

1188
01:04:55,950 --> 01:04:59,630
thinking like all these gay thoughts
cause I'm going to have to do anything and

1189
01:04:59,631 --> 01:05:02,370
we can set up the money. But if you
want to hang out, hey, I'm cool.

1190
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,140
Oh that's hilarious.
Yeah.

1191
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:07,200
And what's crazy is this a girl
that I'm dating here and there like,

1192
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:10,530
but when it came back, I'm like making
out with her and she goes, she goes,

1193
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:13,230
all right, so you didn't kiss anyone but
that hooker this weekend. Right. And like

1194
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:17,590
that's worse. I'm like,
well, I could kiss five

1195
01:05:18,170 --> 01:05:20,800
miscellaneous girls, but I kiss one
hooker. That's fine. You're [inaudible].

1196
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:22,930
You're okay with that
because of the story's funny.

1197
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:29,680
Don't complain. Just accepted
universally. Don't complain.

1198
01:05:29,950 --> 01:05:33,790
Vegas was fucking awesome. Thank you to
everybody who came out show sold out.

1199
01:05:34,290 --> 01:05:36,820
Awesome. Giant theater
to Mandalay. Big Theater.

1200
01:05:36,821 --> 01:05:40,120
This is the biggest place I've ever
done in Vegas. Who's like 1700 seats.

1201
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:43,330
It was awesome. Yeah, that was cool.
How'd you, how did it feel to be on stage?

1202
01:05:43,331 --> 01:05:47,320
Because it seemed like it's,
that's hard to grab a whole theater.

1203
01:05:47,321 --> 01:05:50,830
I mean this was like where you see the
play cats. This is not just a theater.

1204
01:05:50,831 --> 01:05:53,460
This is a huge theater.
Well it was the lion king.

1205
01:05:53,461 --> 01:05:56,550
That's where the lion king's blanking.
Not. They're all the same thing.

1206
01:05:56,620 --> 01:06:00,700
Cats like exactly entertaining.
Right? Cats has done.

1207
01:06:00,730 --> 01:06:03,800
Everybody realize that cats is a scam.
About five years ago this like,

1208
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:05,260
what the fuck are we watching?

1209
01:06:05,650 --> 01:06:09,160
Did girl take me to see cats once when
I was like fucking 19 I was dating this

1210
01:06:09,161 --> 01:06:13,320
girl. She took me and I was 19
hours a a wild monkey. All right,

1211
01:06:13,321 --> 01:06:14,111
and I was a savage.

1212
01:06:14,111 --> 01:06:17,720
I couldn't sit down and watch something
stupid like cats and I sit in,

1213
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:17,990
I don't know,

1214
01:06:17,990 --> 01:06:21,430
sitting there and it was an hour and a
half and then it stops and you get an

1215
01:06:21,431 --> 01:06:23,470
intermission and I'm like,
get your shit.

1216
01:06:23,471 --> 01:06:26,680
There's nowhere where I want to just
get your shit and we're going to go.

1217
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:30,820
We're not going to watch these fucking
people parade around in a cat outfit

1218
01:06:30,850 --> 01:06:33,910
isn't terrible show.
It's admirable.

1219
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:38,320
Katz was one of those things that is
just a mind numbing assault on your

1220
01:06:38,321 --> 01:06:42,040
attention span. By the time you get
done. If you take a girl to see cats,

1221
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:44,440
by the time you're done,
your self esteem is so low,

1222
01:06:44,441 --> 01:06:48,370
you could barely get it up to fucker
because you've just been abused by some

1223
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:51,580
terrible entertainment
and then you finally go,

1224
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:55,420
what the fuck is wrong with her that
she likes this and why am I with her and

1225
01:06:55,421 --> 01:06:56,830
what am I doing with my life?

1226
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:58,750
These are the type of people
that I'm hanging out with.

1227
01:06:58,751 --> 01:07:00,970
Someone who likes cats like you're,

1228
01:07:00,971 --> 01:07:05,940
you're fascinated by these fucking
retards prancing around in giant catsuits.

1229
01:07:05,950 --> 01:07:06,221
First of all,

1230
01:07:06,221 --> 01:07:10,120
they don't look anything like cats do
those like people with stupid outfits on.

1231
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:14,110
Anyway, the lion king is nothing
like this, like actually exciting.

1232
01:07:14,390 --> 01:07:16,990
And we were in the lion king theater.
It's Mandalay Bay theater.

1233
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:19,420
It's where they show the lion king.
But it was huge.

1234
01:07:19,421 --> 01:07:23,780
It was a fucking like 1700 seeds
giant fucking room did, did you,

1235
01:07:23,890 --> 01:07:27,250
did you feel like you had to change your
style anyway or your time in a bunch of

1236
01:07:27,251 --> 01:07:30,730
big rooms before and you know like the
place I do an Edmonton when I do to

1237
01:07:30,731 --> 01:07:33,820
Canada, that's more than 2000
people. Plus I did in Calgary.

1238
01:07:33,821 --> 01:07:36,610
That was like 2000 people or 1800 people.

1239
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:39,910
Toronto is something where somewhere
around that, the next one we're doing it.

1240
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:41,470
Toronto and tickets are
going to go on sale soon.

1241
01:07:41,471 --> 01:07:43,600
I know everybody keeps
asking me about Toronto. Um,

1242
01:07:43,630 --> 01:07:48,260
I think they go on sale this Friday,
but it's a theater in Toronto and uh,

1243
01:07:48,310 --> 01:07:51,290
it's like 2,500 seats.
So I'll tell you all about that show.

1244
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:53,130
There's a secret link to that.
I just got sent.

1245
01:07:53,150 --> 01:07:56,290
I don't know if you're allowed to
tweet that link or if, well, no,

1246
01:07:56,320 --> 01:08:00,980
because it's not, they're
not up yet. Right. What's the
name of the theater? Blurry.

1247
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:03,490
It would seem like they're,

1248
01:08:03,850 --> 01:08:08,300
the different experience would be
doing like full Colosseum. Yeah. Yeah.

1249
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:11,380
That's almost impossible
to connect with people.

1250
01:08:11,530 --> 01:08:14,650
But I feel like you can still connect
with people if there's a, you know,

1251
01:08:14,651 --> 01:08:19,310
I think like you can get a couple
thousand people and if they're cool,

1252
01:08:19,311 --> 01:08:22,480
everybody good. Have a good
time. And you're still in
the grove though. You know,

1253
01:08:22,510 --> 01:08:24,410
you get to like some,
I heard like Larry,

1254
01:08:24,411 --> 01:08:28,560
the cable guy does like football stadiums.
He does like 50,000 people since then.

1255
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,110
Wrap your head around that shit son.

1256
01:08:30,590 --> 01:08:34,670
Just wrap your head around that Massey
Hall in Toronto. That's where it is.

1257
01:08:34,671 --> 01:08:39,290
And that'll be on April the 29th. I said
tickets I think go on sale on Friday.

1258
01:08:40,010 --> 01:08:42,350
But um, uh, you know, 50,000 people.

1259
01:08:42,351 --> 01:08:45,380
He does like the whole fucking football
stadium filled with Larry the cable

1260
01:08:45,381 --> 01:08:50,210
again, cable guy fans. That's impossible
to connect to those people. I mean, yeah,

1261
01:08:50,211 --> 01:08:51,120
you hope you do you,

1262
01:08:51,130 --> 01:08:54,800
you get the people in the front and you
lock eyes with them and keep the party

1263
01:08:54,801 --> 01:08:58,640
rolling. But yeah, there's not a lot of
room for ad libbing and fucking around.

1264
01:08:58,641 --> 01:09:01,160
Yeah. You know, it's just
here's a show, Bang, Bang, Bang.

1265
01:09:01,161 --> 01:09:05,390
You got to bust it out and his is
short and tight in order as possible.

1266
01:09:05,570 --> 01:09:07,700
You know the,
the best thing about small clubs,

1267
01:09:07,701 --> 01:09:10,730
like we're going to do a sales
comedy hole in La this weekend.

1268
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:14,750
Brian's going to do it to Brian does it
all the time and it's on Melrose real

1269
01:09:14,751 --> 01:09:18,350
intimate place. Like when it's filled, I
think it only gets like 70 or 80 people.

1270
01:09:18,670 --> 01:09:23,150
Right? They're, they're expanding it.
Yeah. He bought the place really recently.

1271
01:09:23,290 --> 01:09:27,110
Sally used to have a place
on labrea. Right. So was it
really another small place,

1272
01:09:27,111 --> 01:09:29,730
a fat like a hundred or so.
And what uh,

1273
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:33,110
that he did was he bought a new place and
then with the new place he's expanding

1274
01:09:33,111 --> 01:09:35,800
the back area and then it's
going to be like a 300 seater.

1275
01:09:35,810 --> 01:09:40,130
But for right now it's like really
small and um, Salah, you know,

1276
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:43,070
he's got this like just,
it's just a sweet set up.

1277
01:09:43,071 --> 01:09:46,100
He's like always does open mics
all the time. Every day. Yeah.

1278
01:09:46,101 --> 01:09:50,810
It's always like promoting comedy and
trying to get like young comics to,

1279
01:09:50,811 --> 01:09:53,150
to really get into it and you know,
and help him out.

1280
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:55,870
One of my friends from South Park,
he's making a movie,

1281
01:09:55,930 --> 01:09:58,620
I call it serial comic and a,

1282
01:09:58,630 --> 01:10:03,010
it's about a comic that it's like mixed
with Dexter and he's never done standup

1283
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:05,860
comedy. And so I was hanging out with
them last night and he's like, you know,

1284
01:10:05,890 --> 01:10:08,740
cause I'm doing this. Maybe I think
I need to know what it feels like.

1285
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:13,090
And so him and the other guy went on
stage and did their first stand up out of

1286
01:10:13,091 --> 01:10:14,890
the blue like no material.

1287
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:18,090
And they did good for the first
time with no material just going up.

1288
01:10:18,091 --> 01:10:19,810
And I told them like,
just tell a funny story.

1289
01:10:19,811 --> 01:10:23,470
Just tell some stories that's happened to
you, you know, and try to do it onstage.

1290
01:10:23,770 --> 01:10:26,230
They both did. Now they're,
they're, they're, they're,
they're addicted to it now.

1291
01:10:26,231 --> 01:10:28,570
They're like immediately
like fucking first hit.

1292
01:10:28,690 --> 01:10:33,010
If you do good man, do good to get
that bug. There's thing, you know,

1293
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:37,810
shit gets crazy. It's weird. There's a
difference in doing a large audience,

1294
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:42,520
but, um, it's not a bad difference.
It's good for a show like a special,

1295
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:43,750
like doing a special,

1296
01:10:43,810 --> 01:10:46,660
like I want to do one special at
least where I do it in a comedy club.

1297
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:49,390
Cause the last one I did in
a big theater, I think, um,

1298
01:10:49,630 --> 01:10:52,580
when you do a special though, it's
really kind of got to be here. The jokes,

1299
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:56,080
the jokes, not that much fucking around.
Here's the jokes, you know, it's like,

1300
01:10:56,081 --> 01:10:58,870
it's not the same as like a,
a live audience.

1301
01:10:58,871 --> 01:11:02,530
They appreciate you no more fucking
around and ad libbing. And it's like,

1302
01:11:02,531 --> 01:11:06,370
it's like a looser, more open thing.
But in, in transmitting it to a DVD,

1303
01:11:06,371 --> 01:11:10,750
it really should be, you
know, the material kind of
as it's written, you know?

1304
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:14,730
So the difference is that if
you're doing a, um, a big theater,

1305
01:11:14,731 --> 01:11:17,970
you just don't feel like you have
as much slack. Right. You know,

1306
01:11:17,971 --> 01:11:21,720
like when you're in a, like a little
seat, a little, um, a hundred seater,

1307
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:25,080
it's like a little tight, intimate club
feel like you just, there's no pressure.

1308
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:26,940
You know, we're all just fucking
around having a good time,

1309
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:30,360
whereas it's like 2000 people. It's
like, okay, I'm here to do a show.

1310
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:33,300
And they get ramped up. Like
Joey, like Joey came out,

1311
01:11:33,301 --> 01:11:38,100
guns blazing crazy.
Joey knew it was a show slaughtered,

1312
01:11:38,101 --> 01:11:42,490
slaughtered, or fucking piss. And I fell
down. I fell down laughing. I said that,

1313
01:11:42,510 --> 01:11:45,540
you know, I th I told them after
the show, I told a bunch of people,

1314
01:11:45,541 --> 01:11:47,520
I think that's the funniest
I've ever seen anybody do.

1315
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:50,540
I don't think I've ever seen
anybody rose to the occasion. Yeah.

1316
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:54,910
15 minutes of just destruction just
went out there and hulk smashed on.

1317
01:11:55,470 --> 01:11:59,040
It was pretty bad ass. But um, yeah, Joey
knows how to do those kinds of rooms.

1318
01:11:59,041 --> 01:12:01,620
He just goes out there and hits him with
his best shit over and over and over

1319
01:12:01,621 --> 01:12:06,210
again, you know? But, uh, the theater
was bad ass. It's fucking really big.

1320
01:12:06,211 --> 01:12:10,890
And so we're going to do it again
on July 3rd, I think it is. Yeah.

1321
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:14,370
I think that's what it is. Yeah.
It's whatever the, uh, the next,

1322
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,760
there's going to be,
um,

1323
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:20,280
a weekend and whatever
the Friday is July 2nd.

1324
01:12:20,350 --> 01:12:24,090
So it's July 1st because July 2nd
is the UFC. It's July 4th weekend,

1325
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:28,290
but July 4th is Monday.
So I'll be there on the first July 1st.

1326
01:12:28,350 --> 01:12:30,530
You know, what's kind of show, I don't
know if you guys have ever seen it,

1327
01:12:30,590 --> 01:12:33,200
but in the big stadiums,
I talked to a hypnotist actually,

1328
01:12:33,201 --> 01:12:36,950
and he was saying the bigger the stadium,
it seems like that'd be hard to do,

1329
01:12:36,951 --> 01:12:40,160
like hypnotized someone with all that
pressure. But the bigger the stadium,

1330
01:12:40,161 --> 01:12:43,920
like the easier the people go to
sleep. Wow. Somehow. Yeah. Like it's,

1331
01:12:43,921 --> 01:12:48,020
it's in versus the opposite. Yeah.
Well I think it's, there's just this,

1332
01:12:48,350 --> 01:12:51,020
I don't know. I mean for
whatever reason, I don't know.

1333
01:12:51,021 --> 01:12:54,350
I can't deeply delve into the
psychology of it, but somehow that,

1334
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:57,290
that type of environment and
they get these people on stage,

1335
01:12:57,291 --> 01:13:00,860
which is unbelievable to me because I
can't imagine being hypnotized personally

1336
01:13:00,861 --> 01:13:04,640
myself. Uh, but credible. But
they'll go, they'll go right out.

1337
01:13:04,641 --> 01:13:07,880
And then obviously they do all that
kind of, that kind of wacky stuff.

1338
01:13:07,881 --> 01:13:10,750
But those shows are pretty
interesting to me that, you know,

1339
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:14,180
they can take somebody in that environment
where they're already nervous and

1340
01:13:14,181 --> 01:13:17,750
like, people are watching me holy
Shit and put them right the fuck out.

1341
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:20,810
You know why? Because some
people are weak, right?

1342
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:23,960
Some people are supposed to be like,
well, and then they do short circuit.

1343
01:13:24,110 --> 01:13:25,600
Some people are supposed to be led,

1344
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:29,060
do subtly take the people out who aren't
falling asleep and they just go away.

1345
01:13:29,061 --> 01:13:31,030
So they start with 12 then with,
you know,

1346
01:13:31,110 --> 01:13:33,680
eight. Yeah. It's amazing how
they know, you know, I, uh,

1347
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:36,750
you should do shows back in Boston
with this guy named Frank Santos,

1348
01:13:36,751 --> 01:13:40,200
who is the r rated hypnotists and
he had a, a killer fucking show.

1349
01:13:40,350 --> 01:13:42,720
He used to do it at stitches comedy club.
And when I first saw it,

1350
01:13:42,721 --> 01:13:45,180
I was 21 I was totally skeptical.
I was like,

1351
01:13:45,181 --> 01:13:48,990
there's no way this guy's gonna hit and
ties all these people 20 minutes into it,

1352
01:13:48,991 --> 01:13:52,050
you know? Absolutely. 100% that
these people are hypnotized.

1353
01:13:52,290 --> 01:13:53,940
And the crazy thing is
this kind of mumbles

1354
01:13:54,220 --> 01:13:56,710
transcendental as he's talking like this.
How's everybody doing? Lazy. Dominating.

1355
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,780
Okay, I'm going to count to
three and I bought a three.

1356
01:13:58,781 --> 01:14:02,320
You're going to go to sleep. One, two,
three clicks are asleep. And like,

1357
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:04,900
what the fuck?
I barely understood what this guy said,

1358
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,330
but meanwhile he's running around
touching him. Oh, your boobies.

1359
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:09,610
Boobies are so happy. You're gonna,
you're going to play with them right now.

1360
01:14:09,611 --> 01:14:11,860
You're gonna play with the babies and
chicks would just playing with their kids.

1361
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:14,880
Yeah. They would say, you are right
now. You are my friend. You, uh,

1362
01:14:14,930 --> 01:14:18,370
you have a raging erection.
Whoa. You can't even believe.

1363
01:14:18,371 --> 01:14:20,050
You can't believe you're actually,
the guy looks down as erection.

1364
01:14:20,051 --> 01:14:21,700
He goes and who's
underneath you right now?

1365
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:26,840
Mcdonogh is like 1980s when you know you
didn't jump away in disgust and horror.

1366
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:32,860
You know those fucking veiny monster Dick
arms. She's got like Dick's for arms.

1367
01:14:33,310 --> 01:14:36,070
That's what they look like.
It was like someone's hard Dick Madonna,

1368
01:14:36,370 --> 01:14:38,200
Madonna's arms la,
like someone's the head

1369
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:43,510
decks cause they're all veiny.
And fucking weird and sinewy and shit.

1370
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:48,160
Flip like a raging Dick. She's raging Dick
arms. But anyway, he would do this bit,

1371
01:14:48,340 --> 01:14:52,000
you know, uh, Madonna's underneath
you and guys would not in their pants.

1372
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:55,750
So give it to you, give it to you
and, and you're going to come, oh,

1373
01:14:55,751 --> 01:14:58,990
and the guy would like lay there like
this and you'd go get the fuck out.

1374
01:14:59,060 --> 01:15:03,040
You realize that I just noted in his
pants like, oh, a hundred percent dealer.

1375
01:15:03,210 --> 01:15:06,730
They, dude, Frank Santos is a master at
that. I know. He still does shows. Yeah,

1376
01:15:06,731 --> 01:15:09,130
on the East Coast around
Boston and Rhode Island.

1377
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:12,040
I think he's originally from
Providence, Rhode Island. And he did,

1378
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:13,870
he used to have shows.
He used to book shows too.

1379
01:15:13,871 --> 01:15:16,610
He was one of the first guys I actually
headlined for you headlined meanie and

1380
01:15:16,611 --> 01:15:19,990
there's little room that he did in, in
Rhode Island. Really? Really great guy.

1381
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:23,320
But um, he was, uh, the
funniest hypnotist too,

1382
01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:24,790
cause he was always like really dirty,

1383
01:15:24,791 --> 01:15:27,760
ridiculous shit that he would make
these people do. But when it was over,

1384
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:30,010
you know, hey wake them up
and snap him out of it. Man.

1385
01:15:30,011 --> 01:15:32,950
The look on their face like they
didn't have a fucking clue was to,

1386
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:35,470
it was like Eddie Bravo after
a night of Jack Daniels.

1387
01:15:35,890 --> 01:15:40,810
It was just just fucking who where,
where am I? Who's closer are these,

1388
01:15:41,230 --> 01:15:45,200
I bet his sex life is awesome.
Eddie Bravo. The hypnotist.

1389
01:15:45,850 --> 01:15:46,960
Cause you just hypnotize a chick.

1390
01:15:47,090 --> 01:15:50,170
That's funny you just said that because
there was a guy who was a hypnotist

1391
01:15:50,171 --> 01:15:53,320
slash comedian at the comedy
store and he was really gross.

1392
01:15:53,321 --> 01:15:56,950
He was kind of a creepy dude who at one
point in time was like kind of funny

1393
01:15:56,980 --> 01:16:00,970
like back in the 80s but something
happened along the way and he never really

1394
01:16:00,971 --> 01:16:04,450
hit and it was always kind of stuck
around and went up to him like cruises and

1395
01:16:04,451 --> 01:16:05,231
weird shit.
But now,

1396
01:16:05,231 --> 01:16:09,790
so now he's like in his
50s and not successful and
creepy and really not funny.

1397
01:16:09,791 --> 01:16:11,080
You would go on stage and not be funny,

1398
01:16:11,230 --> 01:16:14,170
but he was always trying to
hypnotize bitches. That was his move.

1399
01:16:14,290 --> 01:16:15,910
And so one time I was at the comedy store,

1400
01:16:15,911 --> 01:16:18,580
like one of the last times I was there
and I went to the cover booth to ask

1401
01:16:18,581 --> 01:16:21,850
something and he was in the corner
with his check and all I heard was, no,

1402
01:16:21,851 --> 01:16:23,110
I'm not going to let you hypnotize me.

1403
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:27,790
Well that's the thing like you have
like apparently trust is a huge,

1404
01:16:27,850 --> 01:16:30,370
you can't just go around
hypnotizing random people.

1405
01:16:30,371 --> 01:16:33,910
They got one if he was
trying just swinging. No,

1406
01:16:33,911 --> 01:16:38,680
he was asking let me touch
you. Let me, yeah, cause they
got, they got to accept it.

1407
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:41,740
You know, I want her to drowning my dick.
Is that or read, you're in the lake.

1408
01:16:41,890 --> 01:16:45,130
There's only one way to breathe.
Talking about fighting it.

1409
01:16:45,370 --> 01:16:47,760
I need to take a read from
those missing in action movies.

1410
01:16:47,761 --> 01:16:50,890
I remember they would always hide from
the Vietcong by grabbing to read and they

1411
01:16:50,891 --> 01:16:52,560
would go under it,
breathed through the rebid pitch.

1412
01:16:52,570 --> 01:16:56,810
Try breathing through a fucking read when
your heart's beating 150 pizzas second

1413
01:16:56,811 --> 01:17:01,180
snorkels and Jesus Christ got damaged.
You can't breathe through a fucking read.

1414
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:04,060
I tried breathing for a snorkel
shitty one that I bought at like some

1415
01:17:04,061 --> 01:17:07,870
convenience store. There's
terrible, yeah, it's claustrophobic.

1416
01:17:07,871 --> 01:17:11,300
If you added about another button and
a half to it will be nearly impossible

1417
01:17:11,301 --> 01:17:14,660
just because of the heaviness of the air.
Oh really? Yeah. That's what does it,

1418
01:17:14,661 --> 01:17:15,860
it's the compression of the air.

1419
01:17:15,861 --> 01:17:20,390
Even under a little bit of water like so
I guess 30 feet is an entire atmosphere,

1420
01:17:20,450 --> 01:17:24,080
I believe of pressure like a doubles
your whole atmosphere. So whatever,

1421
01:17:24,081 --> 01:17:26,150
varying degrees of that.
But that's what makes it so hard.

1422
01:17:26,151 --> 01:17:30,650
It's because you're sucking,
you know, heavier air through
that, through that, uh,

1423
01:17:30,740 --> 01:17:33,860
instead of apparatus. Yeah. Well it's
just hard breathing through. First of all,

1424
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:34,930
hard through a too.

1425
01:17:34,930 --> 01:17:38,150
And for the longest time I used to have
to only breathe through my mouth because

1426
01:17:38,151 --> 01:17:40,490
my nose was busted up,
like got my nose fixed.

1427
01:17:40,491 --> 01:17:43,580
They opened it up and now I can breathe
through my nose and my mouth and I'm

1428
01:17:43,581 --> 01:17:46,760
like, oh, sweet oxygen come to me.

1429
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:50,150
And so when I'm in the water with
that shitty scuba thing, I was like,

1430
01:17:50,151 --> 01:17:53,180
this is fucking gross. Just breeding
only out of your mouth again.

1431
01:17:53,190 --> 01:17:56,020
So knowing a bit claustrophobic.
Yeah,

1432
01:17:56,390 --> 01:17:59,330
you get a little claustrophobic and you
also realize like how you know how you

1433
01:17:59,331 --> 01:18:01,070
need your nose to fucking breathe with.

1434
01:18:01,220 --> 01:18:03,800
Like I have friends that
have not had that operation,

1435
01:18:03,801 --> 01:18:07,550
the deviated septum operation and they're
dudes who fucked up noses. I'm like,

1436
01:18:07,551 --> 01:18:11,510
Bro, get that shit fixed man. I'm telling
you. And some guys are like, well,

1437
01:18:11,511 --> 01:18:14,210
I'm just going to break it again anyway,
like fighters. And I'm like, so what?

1438
01:18:14,211 --> 01:18:17,660
Break getting in any way? Trust me,
I get it fixed. Get it fixed now.

1439
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:18,710
Because you know,

1440
01:18:18,710 --> 01:18:22,520
you don't realize how much more you can
breathe out of your fucking nose when

1441
01:18:22,521 --> 01:18:23,420
your nose works.

1442
01:18:23,630 --> 01:18:27,500
You know you got like 30% more cardio
that way and you smell farts way better.

1443
01:18:27,770 --> 01:18:31,070
And I always knew when Brian was smoking
this motherfucker tell us he quit

1444
01:18:31,071 --> 01:18:35,480
smoking. I'm like, bitch, I smell
cigarettes. Damn you and your new nose.

1445
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:41,000
I know fucks. Figgis was fun though.
We had a good goddamn time. That was a,

1446
01:18:41,001 --> 01:18:42,670
that was the best time
we ever had at those.

1447
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:45,710
The best audience we ever had in Vegas
too, for sure. Right? Yeah, yeah.

1448
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:47,810
Oh yeah, definitely. It was great.

1449
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:52,070
But what was even better as Ari and Jodie
is at the UFC, Joe. Yeah, that's right.

1450
01:18:52,071 --> 01:18:56,300
Ari and Joey dropped acid at the UFC and
they kept on like saying they're going

1451
01:18:56,301 --> 01:18:57,500
to dose me the whole weekend.

1452
01:18:57,501 --> 01:18:59,960
Like you're either going to take it or
I'm going to dose you and you're not

1453
01:18:59,961 --> 01:19:00,621
going to know about it.

1454
01:19:00,621 --> 01:19:04,220
So you choose which one impression that
I didn't want to yell it, but it wasn't

1455
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:06,600
cock sucker. Well, now that we have these,

1456
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:10,590
we have these puff shields because
people are complaining about our ps,

1457
01:19:10,710 --> 01:19:12,690
what do they call pop shield
pops shields or something.

1458
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:14,450
Fucking professional folks.
This,

1459
01:19:14,490 --> 01:19:16,590
we've reached the next
evolution of this fucking thing.

1460
01:19:16,650 --> 01:19:19,140
I'd like to hide behind
him. But uh, Joey and Ari,

1461
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:21,750
by the time we went to a
dinner right after the fights,

1462
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:25,590
they were fucking blasted.
Just glassy eye.

1463
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:30,960
And what's funny is I, when I've, a
couple of times ago, UFC is ago, uh,

1464
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:31,890
there was this time when,

1465
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:36,090
I think it was one of the first times
I ever went to the USC with Ari and Ari

1466
01:19:36,091 --> 01:19:37,860
was like dropping down on the ground.

1467
01:19:37,861 --> 01:19:42,210
He was being so emotional about the whole
thing. And he's like, oh, by the way,

1468
01:19:42,211 --> 01:19:45,450
I never told you this, but that
time I was on ecstasy and I'm like,

1469
01:19:45,451 --> 01:19:48,930
well that makes sense. So, Whoa,
whoa. What UFC did you take?

1470
01:19:48,940 --> 01:19:51,630
Excess is the one where,
uh, what's his name? Uh,

1471
01:19:51,631 --> 01:19:54,660
with a short guy with
the long hair? Uh, yeah,

1472
01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:58,630
his mom was sitting on one side on
the ground crying because his is,

1473
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:03,840
there were fighting and an Ra was on
the other side on the ground going like

1474
01:20:03,930 --> 01:20:08,280
acting really weird and, and I
thought, yeah, go, I can't American

1475
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:11,210
click, click, Click Guido. That, no,

1476
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:13,770
it wasn't that fun cause that
if I wasn't the palms. No, no.

1477
01:20:13,771 --> 01:20:18,210
This was a in Vegas and I remember it was,
it wasn't Vegas, was it the big arena?

1478
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:20,140
No, it's a small arena. Oh,
so it wasn't the palm. Yeah,

1479
01:20:20,150 --> 01:20:24,300
cause I can't imagine his mom crying. Oh,
so it must've been that one. Yeah. Yeah.

1480
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:27,150
So his mom's freaking out in one site
in Ari's freaking out on the air side.

1481
01:20:27,151 --> 01:20:30,140
And I always thought like, wow, I
never went to USC with Aria. But man,

1482
01:20:30,150 --> 01:20:31,500
he's really into it.

1483
01:20:31,501 --> 01:20:36,501
USC and he's like a 1940s I keep
like he would sit there and be like,

1484
01:20:36,660 --> 01:20:39,210
yes. Like yes. Like I
was thinking like, wow,

1485
01:20:39,390 --> 01:20:41,280
you guys really go to
very many at the palms.

1486
01:20:41,281 --> 01:20:43,740
It might've been one of the only ones
who've ever went to that, right? No,

1487
01:20:43,741 --> 01:20:46,200
I've been to about five at the pond.
Have you really done? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1488
01:20:46,230 --> 01:20:48,040
Oh was it the hard rock?
I'm confusing. What? Yeah.

1489
01:20:48,050 --> 01:20:50,730
I've never been to the hard rock. Okay.
We used should do them at the hard rock.

1490
01:20:51,030 --> 01:20:53,340
You know the palms is the
best place to see that.

1491
01:20:53,341 --> 01:20:55,070
It's my favorite best place for the UFC.
Yeah,

1492
01:20:55,090 --> 01:20:57,000
there's not a bad seat in the
house. Yeah, it's awesome.

1493
01:20:57,030 --> 01:21:00,290
And even though like the first level,
it's like perfect height, you know,

1494
01:21:00,410 --> 01:21:02,940
that I fucking wish they were all
at the palms elevated sucks is that,

1495
01:21:03,270 --> 01:21:06,420
well it's awesome for the people that
are in the back, that little back area,

1496
01:21:06,421 --> 01:21:07,400
like behind these,

1497
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:11,370
like most of the seats are facing one
side of the icon and then there's just

1498
01:21:11,371 --> 01:21:13,080
some bleachers on the
other side of the octagon,

1499
01:21:13,081 --> 01:21:14,640
which is like the dopest seats ever,

1500
01:21:14,790 --> 01:21:17,910
which is where they sit like rockstars
and shit. Yeah. You know, but it's like,

1501
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:22,320
you know, there's, it's only like how many
thousands of seats for 40,000. Not much.

1502
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:25,710
It's fucking incredible nights.
It's incredible. Super intimate too.

1503
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:29,550
They do comedy shows. Their Katt Williams
does a comedy shows there. But um,

1504
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:32,130
so he was on ecstasy at this
time, that time. And so that,

1505
01:21:32,131 --> 01:21:35,430
that explains it because I ever since
when Todd Duffy was in your way and you

1506
01:21:35,431 --> 01:21:37,620
wanted him to move and no one
could get them to me. Yeah.

1507
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:43,040
That was [inaudible] right in front of
Brian seat screaming Kubu no up the foods

1508
01:21:43,350 --> 01:21:45,450
yet. He's one of those guys. I
just stood up the whole fight.

1509
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:48,180
You don't stand up the whole fight.
If something crazy happens. Sure.

1510
01:21:48,181 --> 01:21:51,570
Everyone stands up together kind of thing,
even though that's annoying. But he,

1511
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:54,810
he stood up the whole fight in front of
me and I'm not gonna say anything to the

1512
01:21:54,811 --> 01:21:55,530
guy,
but,

1513
01:21:55,530 --> 01:21:58,380
but that wasn't the fight that this was
one where we were sitting like in the

1514
01:21:58,381 --> 01:22:01,980
front row, almost like on,
on regular chairs. Okay.

1515
01:22:01,981 --> 01:22:06,210
So you guys got the sweet cvs sweet seats.
But uh, and so then I always thought,

1516
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:09,690
ever since then I'm like, wow, I never
knew our, he loved the UFC that much.

1517
01:22:09,691 --> 01:22:12,750
That's really crazy. By the way, those
seeds in the floor and not as good, right?

1518
01:22:12,810 --> 01:22:16,710
No one above is the best. Yeah. One above
is the best. And even like this last one,

1519
01:22:16,711 --> 01:22:20,050
we actually had the second one,
like front row seats,

1520
01:22:20,070 --> 01:22:23,200
but the second tier and it
was perfect because you,

1521
01:22:23,201 --> 01:22:26,920
we just kind of like looked
over the whole ring, you know,

1522
01:22:26,921 --> 01:22:28,650
it's like nothing was in the way.

1523
01:22:28,651 --> 01:22:30,780
No camera man were in the
way when they hit the ground.

1524
01:22:30,781 --> 01:22:34,740
You could see the grounds. So it was
awesome. The floors like the pimp spot,

1525
01:22:34,830 --> 01:22:38,130
you know, you're like, I'm on the floor
a bitch, you know, but it's really not.

1526
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:42,220
It's like it's a good show each side.
Like deep in the floor. Yeah. Right.

1527
01:22:42,230 --> 01:22:44,570
Front row floor is the only
good thing about the floors.

1528
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:45,990
Looking at gender Jamison the whole time.

1529
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:50,670
She's whoever she brings with
you doing this really fancy suit.

1530
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:55,290
Anybody that does well on new UFC
though, it's a, it's a kick ass Yvette.

1531
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:56,900
There's nothing like it.
I mean it's,

1532
01:22:56,910 --> 01:23:00,300
you think like you'd watch them on TV
but it's different when you're there like

1533
01:23:00,301 --> 01:23:03,180
it is. Hola. Si. Yeah.

1534
01:23:03,390 --> 01:23:06,220
He texted me in the middle of it in
middle of a while. He was on acid.

1535
01:23:06,230 --> 01:23:06,431
He goes,

1536
01:23:06,431 --> 01:23:10,650
how is this not like Roman
Colosseum texted me while
I was blasted on the asset.

1537
01:23:10,660 --> 01:23:13,390
Right. And I thought it was an interesting
text, you know? I mean, but it's,

1538
01:23:13,391 --> 01:23:16,360
we always think that, and we always
say this, I said right word, you know,

1539
01:23:16,361 --> 01:23:19,630
that's what I said back to them. But
then if I had known and he was on acid,

1540
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:21,840
yeah I should have said,
well by the way, I'm on now.

1541
01:23:21,850 --> 01:23:24,700
But they didn't want me to tell.
They don't want me to tell you until,

1542
01:23:24,790 --> 01:23:26,620
I don't know why. But
they were like, okay,

1543
01:23:26,621 --> 01:23:30,010
you can tell Joe now and so I I what you
were worried about last time about the

1544
01:23:30,011 --> 01:23:34,960
air? Yeah, I, Joey Diaz and ours. You fear
run acid right now. Enjoy your replay.

1545
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:38,710
But it was funny because the whole
time Ari's like tears in his eyes.

1546
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:42,580
So emotional like when the graphics kind
of how it should be a little bit though

1547
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:44,350
when the graphics came
on and he's just like,

1548
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:48,680
oh this is so great and I
wouldn't take it because of,

1549
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:52,420
to me I've done acid a thousand times,
but it's like,

1550
01:23:52,450 --> 01:23:55,420
to me acid is nature.
Acid is being with your friends.

1551
01:23:55,421 --> 01:23:58,600
Camping acid is sitting on your
couch watching pink Floyd the wall.

1552
01:23:58,690 --> 01:24:01,960
It's not in a coliseum with
thousands of crazy fucking gaps.

1553
01:24:03,190 --> 01:24:04,023
Mushrooms,

1554
01:24:08,050 --> 01:24:11,770
I like mushrooms could actually be better
than acid cause that's kind of more of

1555
01:24:11,771 --> 01:24:13,750
a trans mutable, neat
feeling. Like, I mean,

1556
01:24:13,751 --> 01:24:15,610
obviously the Vikings
would take mushrooms,

1557
01:24:15,611 --> 01:24:17,620
have a shirkers before
they would go into war.

1558
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,510
Like you can really maneuver it around.

1559
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:23,290
The vikings were really into the AMANITA
miscarried. That was their shows it.

1560
01:24:23,291 --> 01:24:26,710
So it's a weird mushroom man was there,
would get all hopped up on that.

1561
01:24:26,711 --> 01:24:31,180
And we're invincible. Yeah. That's
tricky. As mushroom to get right apparent.

1562
01:24:31,181 --> 01:24:34,890
I did it once and it was not
good. It didn't work. It's key.

1563
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:37,950
Gave me a weird effect,
but then we mix it up with [inaudible],

1564
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:42,040
cubensis mushrooms and it was a blast
off like somehow the two of them together

1565
01:24:42,041 --> 01:24:47,020
just while we're on APP. But the Amnesia
miscarry Mascara by itself, very tricky.

1566
01:24:47,021 --> 01:24:51,760
Apparently it varies.
Not just genetically, but
geographically and seasonally.

1567
01:24:51,910 --> 01:24:55,960
So it's like you gotta get the right
strain from the right part of the world.

1568
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:59,750
Like I found something in my property
in Colorado when I was up there and a,

1569
01:24:59,770 --> 01:25:01,260
I was like,
I'm not going to take this.

1570
01:25:01,270 --> 01:25:04,710
I'll probably not even going to be
worth it. You know, I'd be twice.

1571
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:08,140
You're gonna acquire them. Really? I
know what it is. It's pretty clear. Yeah,

1572
01:25:08,141 --> 01:25:10,130
there's no doubt when you see
an Amnio to miscarry, you know,

1573
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:14,740
big red cap looks like Santa Claus.
It's Santa Clause.

1574
01:25:15,550 --> 01:25:16,700
Don't just go eating anyway.

1575
01:25:16,810 --> 01:25:20,830
Yeah, I like this. It's so tempting when
you see like a mushroom in your backyard.

1576
01:25:20,831 --> 01:25:24,530
Living was big poofy ones. Just wanted to
cook it. It does look delicious. Right?

1577
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:30,070
Faster back there. Yeah. You better
know your shit son. Yeah. Mommy.

1578
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:31,650
Julie brought a cow shit.

1579
01:25:32,370 --> 01:25:35,910
And there's some that look very close
to psychedelic mushrooms that give you

1580
01:25:35,911 --> 01:25:40,620
just irreversible liver damage to
some of them they just fuck you.

1581
01:25:40,860 --> 01:25:42,390
Mushrooms are so weird man.

1582
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:46,110
Like some of them are super nutritious
and other ones will just fucking crush

1583
01:25:46,111 --> 01:25:48,210
you.
Don't do all kinds of stuff.

1584
01:25:48,211 --> 01:25:51,910
Like the Reishi mushroom gives you a lot
of good energy and and stuff from it.

1585
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:56,400
It's not psychedelic this nutritional
health wise, I'll Chaga, Chaga, mushroom,

1586
01:25:56,401 --> 01:25:57,990
mushrooms, really good. I
started taking out recently.

1587
01:25:58,740 --> 01:26:02,800
Imagine like if I was at the, the,
the greatest moment for me was the uh,

1588
01:26:02,860 --> 01:26:04,020
the rampage chuck

1589
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:06,290
l buildup.
Fight wasn't obviously that good,

1590
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:09,770
but that moment in that
ring was fucking unreal.

1591
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:11,330
It's just the energy that was built up.

1592
01:26:11,331 --> 01:26:14,450
Just people had someone that
wanted to win for that flight.

1593
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:17,930
What's the biggest fight you've ever
seen was that that was probably the,

1594
01:26:17,990 --> 01:26:22,130
that was probably the biggest I would
say. I mean for me, I mean, I seen,

1595
01:26:22,131 --> 01:26:25,850
I've seen some, um, yeah,
I'd have to say that was it.

1596
01:26:25,851 --> 01:26:29,060
People care about that one. I think
you're going to have to come. Well,

1597
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:32,840
you're going to have to come for
Brock Lesnar Junior. Dos Santos. Yeah.

1598
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:37,310
That's going to be chaos. I saw Brock
beat 'em at UFC 100 who was that?

1599
01:26:37,311 --> 01:26:41,720
It was at mirror than, yeah, those mirror
saw that. Saw that one. That was big.

1600
01:26:41,721 --> 01:26:46,310
That was a good event thing. So magical
as the, there's a few big ones coming up,

1601
01:26:46,311 --> 01:26:48,980
man. You've got to go to that one
though. Brock and junior. Dos Santos,

1602
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:52,460
I don't know when it's scheduled
for. It's GSP next. He's in Toronto.

1603
01:26:52,850 --> 01:26:54,890
He's going to be fighting in
April against Jake shields.

1604
01:26:54,891 --> 01:26:58,240
That's a good fucking fight. He wins
that. He gets Anderson, right? Yeah.

1605
01:26:58,870 --> 01:27:02,830
Good luck with a prize.
I would go with,

1606
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:06,600
I would fucking slip on a banana peel
all the way to the locker room. Yeah,

1607
01:27:07,060 --> 01:27:11,020
I would go to that text.
The amazing thing is like I do,

1608
01:27:11,110 --> 01:27:12,310
I kick front kicks,
you know,

1609
01:27:12,311 --> 01:27:16,840
and I have a little target little tag
on my bag and I can sometimes kick the K

1610
01:27:16,841 --> 01:27:18,970
or whatever like that and in the letters,

1611
01:27:19,180 --> 01:27:24,160
but the way his accuracy in a fight where
people are moving and he wrapped all

1612
01:27:24,161 --> 01:27:27,700
five toes around v Tours.
Chimp just perfectly,

1613
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:30,160
didn't even sprain a toe during a Friday.

1614
01:27:30,161 --> 01:27:33,340
Never seen anybody get knocked out
with a front lever for after that,

1615
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:36,250
a couple of people sent me some videos
like there's one from k, one max,

1616
01:27:36,490 --> 01:27:40,120
some my Japanese got landed a Badass
front kick right to the draw. Same thing.

1617
01:27:40,121 --> 01:27:42,700
Knocked the dude out.
Cold Guy fell back like he got shot.

1618
01:27:42,820 --> 01:27:44,110
His was actually better than the v.

1619
01:27:44,111 --> 01:27:48,370
Tore one cause or wasn't totally
out right door was moving still.

1620
01:27:48,430 --> 01:27:52,900
This guy just Bam just fell back like he
got shot at front kick right to the job.

1621
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:56,050
It's just so hard to land on people.
The guy in k one max,

1622
01:27:56,051 --> 01:27:58,120
so he threw a gang of
them to the body first.

1623
01:27:58,300 --> 01:28:01,400
He threw a bunch of them to the body
over and over again and then just shocked

1624
01:28:01,401 --> 01:28:04,010
one up to the face and caught the dude
perfectly on the jaw and knocked him

1625
01:28:04,011 --> 01:28:07,990
unconscious. Yeah. Yeah. I'd never seen
any in all the MMA fights that are called,

1626
01:28:07,991 --> 01:28:09,820
I've called over a thousand fights.

1627
01:28:09,821 --> 01:28:12,970
I've never seen a front kick
to the jaw knockout. Yeah.

1628
01:28:13,030 --> 01:28:14,800
Usually when someone front
kick someone in the face,

1629
01:28:15,100 --> 01:28:17,510
they just knock their head back.
Yeah. It's kind of a, yeah,

1630
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:20,840
it's like flashing the flight of
their foot. He said some whip in that,

1631
01:28:20,870 --> 01:28:24,190
in that too. That was a
front snap. Can't snap.

1632
01:28:24,191 --> 01:28:27,930
That was karate style push kicks or
just kind of move somewhere back.

1633
01:28:27,940 --> 01:28:29,860
But he whipped it up. Yeah. As nasty.

1634
01:28:29,861 --> 01:28:32,940
Well that's because everybody does like
the Thai style, you know, which is like a,

1635
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:35,760
it's a team, you know, it's like you're
pushing the guy off you and they're,

1636
01:28:35,761 --> 01:28:37,780
they're really trying to
regulate with roundhouse kicks.

1637
01:28:37,781 --> 01:28:40,420
They're trying to like get there and
you'd get their distance and push the guy

1638
01:28:40,421 --> 01:28:41,170
off you.
Yeah,

1639
01:28:41,170 --> 01:28:45,820
but like some guys will throw the front
ball kick the snappy like semi Schilt

1640
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:50,050
Semi Shelf Fox people up with that thing
dropped Pete Williams in the UFC with

1641
01:28:50,051 --> 01:28:53,200
it. He stopped, bought her Hari with and
he, that's how he won the Grand Prix.

1642
01:28:53,410 --> 01:28:58,090
He hit, bought her heart with a front kick
to the liver. He just, he's a giant too.

1643
01:28:58,091 --> 01:29:01,440
I mean some shelters, legitimately a
giant. He's seven feet tall, you know.

1644
01:29:01,441 --> 01:29:02,040
So he curls

1645
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:05,850
those toes back and sends that
fucking gigantic log your way.

1646
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:09,330
That log he calls a foot. Yeah. Yeah man.

1647
01:29:09,331 --> 01:29:12,600
There's nothing quite like watching
fights. It's just, there's nothing more,

1648
01:29:12,630 --> 01:29:15,960
nothing that really caters to the
chimpanzee instinct more, you know,

1649
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:20,160
a great game. No matter how much you
enjoy it is still just a game. You know,

1650
01:29:20,161 --> 01:29:22,050
the thrillers are just not as high.
You know,

1651
01:29:22,051 --> 01:29:26,030
it doesn't matter if it's hockey or
baseball or oh my goodness, the ball.

1652
01:29:26,031 --> 01:29:31,020
You went over the park. Exactly. Yay. Many
have a whole, you know, blog about that.

1653
01:29:31,021 --> 01:29:34,870
I mean it's really sport boiled
down to its very roots. I mean it,

1654
01:29:34,910 --> 01:29:36,690
we have those aspects and other sports,

1655
01:29:36,691 --> 01:29:41,550
like you see Dwayne Wade dunk on somebody
and it's fully like he dunks on him

1656
01:29:41,730 --> 01:29:44,730
and he's in his face and it's like
he dominates. It's likely not to.

1657
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:48,390
But then there's Elton pedals does that
showtime kick when he kicks off the

1658
01:29:48,391 --> 01:29:51,540
caging but kicks Ben Henderson
the face of the same foot.

1659
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:54,270
It'll just an approximation
of what we're really after,

1660
01:29:54,271 --> 01:29:57,480
which is primal conflict in dominance.
You know,

1661
01:29:57,481 --> 01:30:00,300
you have all these balls and all
these rules and all these things,

1662
01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:04,500
but it's still just men exercising
that primal instinct to dominate.

1663
01:30:04,630 --> 01:30:06,960
But what I've always said is
that if you fucking route of it,

1664
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:10,320
if you know someone, if you slam dunk a
ball and someone, they can always say,

1665
01:30:10,321 --> 01:30:13,980
well yeah, well I can kick your ass, but
no one gets their ass kicked and goes,

1666
01:30:13,981 --> 01:30:16,890
yeah, well I can slam dunk a
ball on you. Nobody gives a fuck.

1667
01:30:16,910 --> 01:30:19,440
It doesn't go the other way.
That's interesting, isn't it?

1668
01:30:19,710 --> 01:30:23,940
Fucking just fucking human nature. And I
think why people are so attracted to it.

1669
01:30:23,941 --> 01:30:25,170
Fastest growing sport in the world.

1670
01:30:25,171 --> 01:30:28,110
I don't know if that's still an accurate
quote, but it was going around for sure.

1671
01:30:28,111 --> 01:30:30,250
It's there's not even a close
second. Yeah. Talking about the fee,

1672
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:35,460
it's only been around in this country in
this form since the 90s [inaudible] 93

1673
01:30:35,461 --> 01:30:40,230
was the first one that had no rules and
then as far as like sanctioning is just

1674
01:30:40,230 --> 01:30:42,570
a few years after that we started getting
sanctioned and athletic commissions,

1675
01:30:42,571 --> 01:30:44,580
but yeah,
there's not even a close second.

1676
01:30:44,581 --> 01:30:47,820
It makes perfect sense because
people miss that aspect of life.

1677
01:30:47,821 --> 01:30:52,470
I mean everything is so watered down now.
You don't get to exercise that,

1678
01:30:52,650 --> 01:30:57,060
that kind of physical component of
our psyche that still those DNA,

1679
01:30:57,061 --> 01:31:01,080
those genes haven't changed in the last
hundred 200 years where we're not doing

1680
01:31:01,081 --> 01:31:03,200
that anymore or go about
time. Thousand. Yeah,

1681
01:31:03,220 --> 01:31:07,170
10,000 we have the same genetic makeup
as people 10,000 years ago. Supposedly.

1682
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:11,370
That's obviously that's
incredibly theoretical until
we go back in time and take

1683
01:31:11,371 --> 01:31:14,850
a guy from 10,000 years ago and
examine him. But from all accounts,

1684
01:31:14,851 --> 01:31:17,850
if you took a guy from even a hundred
thousand years ago and put them in natural

1685
01:31:17,851 --> 01:31:18,571
close,
you know,

1686
01:31:18,571 --> 01:31:22,320
or rather a normal clothes that we would
wear and put them in a movie theater,

1687
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:25,040
that guy would just sit there. You
wouldn't even be able to still show. Yup.

1688
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:27,780
So the movie start playing and then
he starts shit, it's fucking pants

1689
01:31:29,550 --> 01:31:32,990
here and shit over himself to make it
less attractive to the monster in the

1690
01:31:32,991 --> 01:31:36,240
screen. Curling in the
corner. Knock knock.

1691
01:31:37,950 --> 01:31:41,370
Yeah. Yeah. But you know
those, that DNA is still in,

1692
01:31:41,371 --> 01:31:43,020
of course it's still the same hardware.

1693
01:31:43,021 --> 01:31:45,570
It's basically what it used to
get a chance to exercise that.

1694
01:31:45,571 --> 01:31:48,330
Like they would go to war.
Like I was just, you know,

1695
01:31:48,331 --> 01:31:50,520
I was just talking to you
about Socrates is a warrior.

1696
01:31:50,521 --> 01:31:54,840
You think of this philosopher, you think
about us. He was a bad ass. Just a killer.

1697
01:31:55,020 --> 01:31:57,180
You know, he was one of the
hoplites for the Athenian army.

1698
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:58,590
And where did you read
about all this with socks?

1699
01:31:58,591 --> 01:32:00,610
So I learned about it
from Steven Pressfield's

1700
01:32:00,610 --> 01:32:03,480
book, tides of war, and then I
did a ton of research and, and uh,

1701
01:32:03,490 --> 01:32:06,400
and put it all on my block
but just up a bad ass.

1702
01:32:06,401 --> 01:32:09,130
Like some of the stories are crazy.
Like he was a,

1703
01:32:09,340 --> 01:32:11,910
there was a retreat
coming from, um, from, uh,

1704
01:32:12,180 --> 01:32:14,380
from place to go on a call d Liam.

1705
01:32:14,770 --> 01:32:18,280
And in this retreat basically the
Athenians pushed forward and the flank,

1706
01:32:18,281 --> 01:32:23,020
their flank got, um, got weak on the left
and right side. And then the other, uh,

1707
01:32:23,140 --> 01:32:24,790
general [inaudible],
the other general,

1708
01:32:24,791 --> 01:32:27,610
they are fighting against [inaudible]
and general who also invented the flame

1709
01:32:27,611 --> 01:32:29,100
thrower, which is pretty
sweet. But anyways,

1710
01:32:29,101 --> 01:32:31,380
so you outflanked them and
then the Athenians, you know,

1711
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:33,210
everybody started throwing
those around back then.

1712
01:32:33,211 --> 01:32:35,710
I know he invented the flame
thrower later, but anyways, so, so,

1713
01:32:36,190 --> 01:32:41,140
so on the retreat they have like a
three hour run back to back to Delia.

1714
01:32:41,530 --> 01:32:44,830
And Socrates just stayed
like right at the point,

1715
01:32:44,831 --> 01:32:49,390
like the very back of his men and just
fought for three hours like horses coming

1716
01:32:49,391 --> 01:32:50,850
out of just cutting them down,

1717
01:32:50,860 --> 01:32:53,500
keeping people from running
up the backs and slashing it.

1718
01:32:53,501 --> 01:32:57,250
Its own a Athenian soldiers. I mean it
was still a blood bath, but he was like,

1719
01:32:57,480 --> 01:33:00,520
do we really know what happened?
That could have been some gay dude.

1720
01:33:00,521 --> 01:33:02,050
The Socrates fucked real good.

1721
01:33:02,051 --> 01:33:05,680
Willing to tell crazy stories because
Socrates was a big queen, right?

1722
01:33:05,681 --> 01:33:10,150
They're all gay. Back then they were full
of Shit, man, I don't buy that story.

1723
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:12,520
You look at like Socrates
might've been run like a girl.

1724
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:15,270
I believe.
I have to write poetry.

1725
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:19,850
Look at his mug though. Looking
back, the actual bust of it,

1726
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:21,780
the dude looks like a fuck,
but we don't know.

1727
01:33:21,781 --> 01:33:22,890
We don't know what he really looks like.

1728
01:33:22,891 --> 01:33:26,430
We know drawings while they say they
sculpted them, those motherfuckers

1729
01:33:27,290 --> 01:33:31,460
accurate lion who runs the worst place
on the back. Then they were honest.

1730
01:33:31,461 --> 01:33:33,320
That's what's hilarious.
You know, we assume,

1731
01:33:33,321 --> 01:33:35,120
I mean people are completely
full of shit today.

1732
01:33:35,330 --> 01:33:36,700
Why would we assume that they'd be honest?

1733
01:33:37,390 --> 01:33:42,390
All this fucking Ronald Reagan
revisionist history is driving me crazy.

1734
01:33:43,460 --> 01:33:47,630
As an adult who was an adult
during the Reagan administration,

1735
01:33:48,020 --> 01:33:53,020
Reagan had something like 200 people or
more that were in his cabinet and his in

1736
01:33:54,810 --> 01:33:58,370
the doe that were employed by him in the
White House connected to him that wound

1737
01:33:58,371 --> 01:34:01,490
up getting arrested,
get guilt getting brought up on charges.

1738
01:34:01,491 --> 01:34:04,970
There's some ridiculous number. I mean,
George Carlin had a routine on it.

1739
01:34:05,090 --> 01:34:09,440
He had a whole routine on it about find
it, find George Carlin Reagan's gang,

1740
01:34:10,070 --> 01:34:13,680
because it's just like when you really
like go back and listen to it, you look,

1741
01:34:13,700 --> 01:34:17,180
oh yeah, that's right. Yeah.
They were all fucking crooks.

1742
01:34:17,510 --> 01:34:21,260
They're all crooks and figured out how
to manipulate the moral majority and to

1743
01:34:21,261 --> 01:34:23,660
go with the religious right and get,
you know,

1744
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:27,590
religious people in Christian finally
organize to vote for the presidency.

1745
01:34:27,710 --> 01:34:31,070
That shit didn't exist before with
Nixon and with Carter and with Ford.

1746
01:34:31,250 --> 01:34:32,390
There was,
there wasn't that,

1747
01:34:32,391 --> 01:34:34,730
there wasn't like a big political
movement with Christians.

1748
01:34:34,910 --> 01:34:37,640
That became a reality during
the Reagan administration.

1749
01:34:37,850 --> 01:34:41,660
The Reagan administration was sponsorable
was responsible for so much fucked up

1750
01:34:41,661 --> 01:34:44,330
shit. So much fucked up
shit man. That people don't,

1751
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:48,170
I mean even stuff that people don't,
um, that don't agree with today,

1752
01:34:48,171 --> 01:34:50,210
like in the conservative
movement that support Reagan,

1753
01:34:50,390 --> 01:34:53,150
like negotiating with terrorists
and all kinds of other shit.

1754
01:34:53,151 --> 01:34:56,990
Like there's a dude who called into
the rush Limbaugh show and it's, uh,

1755
01:34:57,020 --> 01:35:01,850
somebody put up in the article
about it on my website and um,

1756
01:35:02,090 --> 01:35:02,811
it was a,

1757
01:35:02,811 --> 01:35:07,811
a really fucking funny
conversation because this guy
was like really well versed

1758
01:35:08,241 --> 01:35:13,040
in the history of Ronald Reagan. I said,
this guy starts arguing with, um, with uh,

1759
01:35:13,070 --> 01:35:17,380
with rush Limbaugh telling him about
what, what Reagan did, um, that uh,

1760
01:35:17,420 --> 01:35:22,070
Reagan raised taxes on social security
that Regan negotiated with terrorists

1761
01:35:22,430 --> 01:35:26,540
sending over and over again arms to Iran
in exchange for hostages performed by

1762
01:35:26,541 --> 01:35:29,830
contrast, Jimmy Carter didn't
give an inch to the Iranian, so,

1763
01:35:29,831 --> 01:35:31,160
which is why we can never get their rent.

1764
01:35:31,220 --> 01:35:33,950
The hostages is soon as
Reagan got into office,

1765
01:35:33,951 --> 01:35:37,880
the literally like right away the
terrorist from I ran were released.

1766
01:35:38,210 --> 01:35:40,910
Why is that? Why is that?
Because they gave him something,

1767
01:35:40,911 --> 01:35:42,120
they had to give them something to,

1768
01:35:42,150 --> 01:35:44,000
to negotiate with terrorist
to get these people back.

1769
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:45,650
Is it worth it to get the people back?
Yeah,

1770
01:35:45,770 --> 01:35:49,370
but I guarantee you part of the agreement
was don't let them back until we're an

1771
01:35:49,371 --> 01:35:53,150
office. It's not really about them being
free. It's about it looking good for us.

1772
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:55,610
Right. Guaran fucking tee. You yell.

1773
01:35:55,870 --> 01:36:00,180
We just live Ollie north cause you
get the thing about Reagan. So listen,

1774
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:02,030
it's 12 minutes long.
We're not going to listen to all of it,

1775
01:36:02,031 --> 01:36:05,390
but just play it a little bit because
George Carlin fucking nailed it.

1776
01:36:05,391 --> 01:36:08,270
And this is back in, you
know, I think he did this. Uh,

1777
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:11,570
she was probably like the nineties,
early, early nineties. Yeah.

1778
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:13,500
Like right after Reagan had.
Yeah.

1779
01:36:13,530 --> 01:36:14,120
Ben,

1780
01:36:14,120 --> 01:36:17,840
I really haven't seen this many people
in one place since they took the group

1781
01:36:17,841 --> 01:36:21,680
photographs of all the criminals in
law breakers in the Ronald Reagan

1782
01:36:21,681 --> 01:36:22,514
administration.

1783
01:36:24,420 --> 01:36:26,580
Yeah.
George Carlin was the shit.

1784
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:34,340
225 of them to 25 people in the Ronald
Reagan administration have either quit or

1785
01:36:37,890 --> 01:36:39,270
been fired,
been arrested,

1786
01:36:39,271 --> 01:36:43,980
indicted or convicted of either breaking
the law or violating the ethics code.

1787
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:46,440
225 of them.

1788
01:36:46,441 --> 01:36:50,700
What do you think the total number of
the Niso laws and how many that haven't

1789
01:36:50,701 --> 01:36:54,810
gotten bone has been investigated by
three separate special prosecutors and

1790
01:36:54,811 --> 01:36:57,150
there's a fourth one waiting
for him in Washington right now.

1791
01:36:57,540 --> 01:37:01,470
Three separate special prosecutors have
had to look into the activities of the

1792
01:37:01,471 --> 01:37:05,070
attorney general and the attorney
general is the nation's leading law

1793
01:37:05,071 --> 01:37:08,670
enforcement officer. He can kill it
right there. See, that's what you got.

1794
01:37:10,650 --> 01:37:15,390
That's crazy. What the fuck man?
What the fuck? And everybody's like.

1795
01:37:15,391 --> 01:37:17,550
Ronald Reagan was an amazing man.

1796
01:37:17,551 --> 01:37:21,780
It's like we have this image of him just
like our grandpa that you know was a

1797
01:37:21,781 --> 01:37:25,050
drunk and he used to beat the fuck out
of your grandma and you just kind of

1798
01:37:25,051 --> 01:37:28,620
forget it. When I get older, it's
like grandpa was, was a good guy.

1799
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:32,190
I remember thinking I loved Ronald Reagan
growing up just because of the 80s,

1800
01:37:32,191 --> 01:37:35,640
kind of embraced Ronald Reagan and
there was like artwork in, you know,

1801
01:37:35,641 --> 01:37:39,000
just like shows. What about Ronald
Reagan? And then we're like, wow,

1802
01:37:39,001 --> 01:37:41,630
Ronald Reagan likes jelly beans.
That's so cool. You know? And yeah,

1803
01:37:41,650 --> 01:37:43,890
Jimmy Carter had peanuts with me
in there, but it's like, well,

1804
01:37:43,891 --> 01:37:48,270
doesn't that show that Ronald Reagan's
unhealthy and bad for America? Yeah, man.

1805
01:37:48,330 --> 01:37:50,820
I don't know.
It's the whole thing is very interesting.

1806
01:37:50,850 --> 01:37:53,910
It's very interesting how we like
to look back in the past with rosy,

1807
01:37:53,940 --> 01:37:56,220
rosy vision,
know if you want to get really

1808
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:59,490
big sometime and go to the Ronald
Reagan museum down there. I did that,

1809
01:37:59,850 --> 01:38:02,100
I did that the other, uh,
like a couple of years ago.

1810
01:38:02,130 --> 01:38:05,910
It's over here like in Calabasas
somewhere. Yeah, it's fucking huge.

1811
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:09,180
And the whole thing is
just Ronald and Nancy.

1812
01:38:09,310 --> 01:38:12,240
Like you'd go on these little movie
theaters and just plays like videos with

1813
01:38:12,241 --> 01:38:14,760
them in it.
You have air force one there.

1814
01:38:14,761 --> 01:38:17,190
You can go and see like
where Ronald Reagan,

1815
01:38:17,250 --> 01:38:20,160
they'd like his plane and like on
this desk there's like jelly beans.

1816
01:38:20,161 --> 01:38:23,550
It's so gay. But it's crazy.
It's too much. Reagan though,

1817
01:38:23,580 --> 01:38:25,860
after a while you're just like, all
right, I've had too much Reagan.

1818
01:38:25,861 --> 01:38:26,820
I can't take this anymore.

1819
01:38:26,940 --> 01:38:29,790
The only thing that I really liked about
Reagan when he was in office was when

1820
01:38:29,791 --> 01:38:31,530
he started talking about aliens.

1821
01:38:31,830 --> 01:38:33,870
One of the things he talked
about with the Russia,

1822
01:38:34,140 --> 01:38:37,470
like how much we would all forget our
differences if we had been attacked by

1823
01:38:37,471 --> 01:38:40,910
aliens from another planet. And I was
like, Oh shit. What does he know? Yeah.

1824
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:43,140
And everybody,
and he didn't do it in just one speech.

1825
01:38:43,141 --> 01:38:46,070
He did it in a couple of speeches.
That same sort of a little hints. Well,

1826
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:49,560
I want to know,
is it little hints or is he just fucking,

1827
01:38:49,620 --> 01:38:51,480
is it just someone wrote something cool.
I mean,

1828
01:38:51,481 --> 01:38:54,480
it's not like Reagan wrote that Shit.
That's just know more than, you know.

1829
01:38:54,481 --> 01:38:58,110
Some Charlie Sheen writes his dialogue
for two and a half men. I mean,

1830
01:38:58,111 --> 01:39:01,260
it's basically the same job. You know,
Reagan didn't write all that stuff.

1831
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:04,320
Somebody else wrote that. Maybe there's
just some cool ass fucking speechwriter.

1832
01:39:04,490 --> 01:39:08,850
It's like, let's just freak these mother
fuckers out. Some alien talk. You know,

1833
01:39:08,940 --> 01:39:10,350
everybody's a little
freaked out about Russia.

1834
01:39:10,351 --> 01:39:12,330
How are we going to bring him down?
I don't know, man. I don't, again,

1835
01:39:12,331 --> 01:39:14,940
we're worried about the bomb.
I'm like, look, you know
the mom's not going to land.

1836
01:39:14,941 --> 01:39:15,930
I know the bumps on the land,

1837
01:39:15,931 --> 01:39:19,020
but we can't tell about how we're really
in cahoots with Russia to keep the

1838
01:39:19,021 --> 01:39:22,020
world down. So what do you want to
do? How about we bring on Barrington?

1839
01:39:22,940 --> 01:39:25,710
How about we just start freaking people
to fuck out talking about aliens from

1840
01:39:25,711 --> 01:39:30,180
another planet and how much we would
come together. I like it. I like it.

1841
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:34,080
Did you see the video of the Ufo over
Jerusalem? It didn't. Is a fake. Yeah.

1842
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:36,480
Who made it sounded making
that you're talking about one.

1843
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:39,060
There's two camera angles.
I didn't, I only saw one.

1844
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:42,300
The weird ones like just sits there
and then they go straight up. Yeah,

1845
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:44,110
it's completely fake with crazy.

1846
01:39:44,111 --> 01:39:48,630
As I showed up to Alison and rocks that
was on the podcast and immediately she

1847
01:39:48,631 --> 01:39:49,650
saw it. She goes, that's fake.

1848
01:39:49,651 --> 01:39:53,790
That's actually a tool in whatever it
was like Adobe premier or something like

1849
01:39:53,791 --> 01:39:56,310
that. That's hilarious. Like three d
or something like that. She's like,

1850
01:39:56,340 --> 01:39:58,680
I could show you how to do them
or when people fake this shit.

1851
01:39:58,681 --> 01:40:02,310
Cause then everybody thinks every
fucking videos back and there is a lot of

1852
01:40:02,311 --> 01:40:03,480
fakes that,
don't get me wrong,

1853
01:40:03,481 --> 01:40:06,540
but there's somebody who's that are legit
footage of shit that happened because

1854
01:40:06,541 --> 01:40:08,100
there's thousands of people
who saw it on the ground,

1855
01:40:08,101 --> 01:40:11,880
like of that Mexico City shit
that's not fake. I just showed you

1856
01:40:11,890 --> 01:40:15,760
Joe a video the other day that I wanted
to see what he thought about it because

1857
01:40:15,761 --> 01:40:19,890
I thought it was fake. It's about this
hamster that was just fighting and,

1858
01:40:19,900 --> 01:40:24,250
and no Joe Joe's. Joe Still doesn't
think it's fake. I still think it's fake.

1859
01:40:24,460 --> 01:40:26,080
And then I was talking to Ari about him.
It's like,

1860
01:40:26,081 --> 01:40:29,140
why do I think that video is fake?
And then I realized,

1861
01:40:29,260 --> 01:40:32,770
did you notice the stomach of it was
pitch black? Like I was just like,

1862
01:40:33,060 --> 01:40:36,240
like all black of the stomach to know,
listen to me, you're thinking too much.

1863
01:40:36,241 --> 01:40:36,840
And I know,

1864
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:39,780
but I'm thinking like real people don't
know what the fuck you're talking about.

1865
01:40:39,781 --> 01:40:42,090
There's a video online. What
is it called? Angry hamster,

1866
01:40:42,150 --> 01:40:45,660
hamster fighting or angry Hampshire.
What? Anyway, the video is,

1867
01:40:45,661 --> 01:40:47,690
these guys are fucking with
this hamster on the hamster,

1868
01:40:47,710 --> 01:40:49,530
gets crazy on them and tried to bite them.

1869
01:40:49,650 --> 01:40:52,140
And then eventually like Eddie
Murphy movie. No, no, no, no.

1870
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:54,100
That's a professor I think.

1871
01:40:54,820 --> 01:40:58,190
Anyway, it's a fucking scared little
animal that's biting people. I mean,

1872
01:40:58,200 --> 01:41:02,860
it's real. It's 100% real hamster of
do forget about the pod. Um, so, um,

1873
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:05,140
so tell me what are your thoughts on,
on Ufo?

1874
01:41:05,141 --> 01:41:08,820
So what shift do you think that you
saw that you think that was like, well,

1875
01:41:08,870 --> 01:41:09,390
digital

1876
01:41:09,390 --> 01:41:13,780
question. I mean, I think some of those,
I think in every major country, you know,

1877
01:41:13,781 --> 01:41:18,010
it's particularly, I think actually back
even farther, you know, into history,

1878
01:41:18,011 --> 01:41:20,440
there's been paintings of
Ufos and different things,

1879
01:41:20,441 --> 01:41:25,390
people all the way back to caves and
other different biblical sightings of, um,

1880
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:28,630
of things appearing over battlefields
and crazy shit like that.

1881
01:41:28,631 --> 01:41:31,870
And you can take all that history
with some footage that we have now.

1882
01:41:31,871 --> 01:41:36,430
Some reports from just super sober pilots,
just dudes that are like, look, I don't,

1883
01:41:36,490 --> 01:41:38,560
I don't really, really like that.
I saw this, I fucking hate it.

1884
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:40,690
I'm not trying to get anything out
of this, but this is what happened.

1885
01:41:40,691 --> 01:41:44,350
We chase this thing. It was doing
crazy stuff. No way we could catch it,

1886
01:41:44,440 --> 01:41:47,770
are machines shut off and we had to
return to base. Like I saw it, you know,

1887
01:41:47,771 --> 01:41:51,040
whatever. And they're not trying to gain
anything out of it. And those, those,

1888
01:41:51,041 --> 01:41:52,690
I think those are really credible.

1889
01:41:52,691 --> 01:41:56,560
Whereas a lot of these other people who
are trying to our, I am the Ufo seer,

1890
01:41:56,620 --> 01:42:00,970
you know, like talk to me about, those are
fucking quacks. But so many just sober,

1891
01:42:00,971 --> 01:42:02,680
gritty people just talking about it.

1892
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:06,060
Yeah. The very first, uh, explanation
or the very first depiction,

1893
01:42:06,061 --> 01:42:09,980
the flying saucer depiction was
from a pilot was from a, you know,

1894
01:42:10,380 --> 01:42:14,560
a military pilot who was watching
these things skip across the sky.

1895
01:42:14,561 --> 01:42:16,380
And I forget the dude's name, but, um,

1896
01:42:16,410 --> 01:42:19,170
I should probably give him credit for
it because it's kind of an interesting

1897
01:42:19,171 --> 01:42:22,260
thing to come up with. And he
said it seemed like saucers
skipping across a lake.

1898
01:42:22,350 --> 01:42:23,940
Yeah. Yeah. Um,

1899
01:42:24,060 --> 01:42:28,470
I'm not opposed to the idea of there
being some visitors from somewhere else,

1900
01:42:28,471 --> 01:42:32,190
whether it's from here that we can't
see, you know, some, a dimension nearby,

1901
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:34,770
whether it's from another planet.
I'm not opposed to that.

1902
01:42:35,070 --> 01:42:38,670
But what I am opposed to is all these
people that have the explanation for it

1903
01:42:38,671 --> 01:42:43,620
like so quickly and all these people that
are like looking for proof of aliens,

1904
01:42:43,621 --> 01:42:45,250
they're like,
they're getting crazy and like,

1905
01:42:45,370 --> 01:42:48,420
like you ever watch that ancient
alien show? No, I haven't,

1906
01:42:48,450 --> 01:42:50,280
but I know what you're talking
about. Yeah. You gotta watch it.

1907
01:42:50,281 --> 01:42:53,820
It's the most ridiculous shit ever.
Like 80% of the stuff they say,

1908
01:42:53,821 --> 01:42:56,190
you're just like, what the fuck
are you talking about? Like, like,

1909
01:42:56,191 --> 01:42:57,870
why are you coming to this conclusion?

1910
01:42:57,871 --> 01:43:01,120
It's like the most unscientific
conclusion ever. Just read. Like they,

1911
01:43:01,121 --> 01:43:01,560
they'll like,

1912
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:05,370
they'll find some ancient stone structures
that are like these giant stones like

1913
01:43:05,371 --> 01:43:05,881
in Peru,

1914
01:43:05,881 --> 01:43:09,750
whether it's really amazing how perfectly
these stones are fitted to the stones

1915
01:43:09,751 --> 01:43:11,430
below them in their hundreds of tons,

1916
01:43:11,431 --> 01:43:13,950
I mean enormous structures
and they go this,

1917
01:43:14,040 --> 01:43:16,830
there's only one way
this could have happened.

1918
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:21,110
It had to have been helped from another
planet. And the people, uh, just,

1919
01:43:21,220 --> 01:43:24,750
it makes me think, I wonder if they
had help from another planet and okay.

1920
01:43:24,810 --> 01:43:28,170
Or maybe people had been around a
lot fucking longer than you think.

1921
01:43:28,230 --> 01:43:32,760
And we know for sure there's been some
massive cataclysmic close mic disasters

1922
01:43:32,910 --> 01:43:36,570
just during recorded history. We know,
we know there's been some big ones in,

1923
01:43:36,571 --> 01:43:38,550
you know, the, the near distant past,

1924
01:43:38,670 --> 01:43:42,810
some mass extinctions that that killed
the dinosaurs that fucking, you know,

1925
01:43:42,811 --> 01:43:45,720
changed a bunch of that shit in the
climate many, many, many times over.

1926
01:43:45,950 --> 01:43:47,640
Wouldn't you just assume that people,
but around,

1927
01:43:47,730 --> 01:43:51,210
isn't that like the number one thing you
would go to? We know people are real.

1928
01:43:51,310 --> 01:43:54,370
All right. We know people
invent some crazy shit. We
know disasters happen. Yeah.

1929
01:43:54,440 --> 01:43:57,590
Maybe people figured out how to make
some crazy shit and the disaster happened

1930
01:43:57,591 --> 01:43:59,330
and then they forgot how to
make that crazy shit. Well,

1931
01:43:59,331 --> 01:44:03,440
a few stragglers made it out,
taught a few things. I mean these,

1932
01:44:03,441 --> 01:44:06,290
these things that they have in Peru
though, the man is fucking fascinating.

1933
01:44:06,550 --> 01:44:11,540
Just really enormous fucking stones. And
they had a discovery recently in Turkey.

1934
01:44:11,541 --> 01:44:14,480
Let me find this real
quick because it's a,

1935
01:44:14,481 --> 01:44:19,250
it predates archeological. A construction,
like they're like, or rather,

1936
01:44:19,251 --> 01:44:22,010
um, the, uh, the oldest
construction, the oldest,

1937
01:44:22,011 --> 01:44:26,660
like real modern stone carving blood
by like fucking some insane number,

1938
01:44:26,661 --> 01:44:28,490
like five or 6,000 years.

1939
01:44:28,790 --> 01:44:31,370
So like what they thought was
like the beginnings of dawn's,

1940
01:44:31,371 --> 01:44:34,290
of civilization back in Mesopotamia
and a 6,000 years ago, yeah.

1941
01:44:34,340 --> 01:44:38,480
This predates that by another 6,000,
right. Massive fucking stone structure.

1942
01:44:38,750 --> 01:44:42,920
Tons and tons of stone moved. Like,
what the fuck is this? Yeah. You know?

1943
01:44:44,090 --> 01:44:47,780
Yeah. And then, you know, the stories
of a, of the Atlantean culture.

1944
01:44:47,781 --> 01:44:51,590
Obviously there's a lot of bs surrounding
that, but it's like, what does it mean?

1945
01:44:51,591 --> 01:44:51,981
Yeah.

1946
01:44:51,981 --> 01:44:55,100
There's a pretty good chance that there
was an advanced civilization that got

1947
01:44:55,101 --> 01:44:59,570
wiped out, you know, by either
earthquake or media or something.

1948
01:44:59,570 --> 01:45:04,400
Just took them out. Yeah, for
sure. Man. 11,000, 500 years ago,

1949
01:45:04,401 --> 01:45:07,220
this thing was built
7,000 years before the,

1950
01:45:07,250 --> 01:45:10,820
what they think was the great pyramid
more than 6,000 years before Stonehenge.

1951
01:45:11,030 --> 01:45:14,270
And they built this gigantic
fucking thing in Turkey.

1952
01:45:14,510 --> 01:45:18,110
And there was another store recently
about this guy from Australia who started,

1953
01:45:18,111 --> 01:45:22,310
uh, looking all throughout Saudi Arabia
with Google maps or Google earth.

1954
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:23,271
And you know,

1955
01:45:23,271 --> 01:45:27,200
Google Earth will bring a
voc and literally zoom you
in on the surface of the

1956
01:45:27,201 --> 01:45:28,080
entire Middle East.

1957
01:45:28,081 --> 01:45:33,081
And this mother fucker found like 1700
archeological discoveries and sites like,

1958
01:45:34,011 --> 01:45:37,340
there's all this ancient shit while
these guys are blowing themselves up.

1959
01:45:37,430 --> 01:45:38,930
I thought,
I thought it was just the,

1960
01:45:39,090 --> 01:45:43,180
the whole gang of people found that that's
the total number of [inaudible]. Oh,

1961
01:45:43,181 --> 01:45:44,540
really? Yeah. That's
not one to one person.

1962
01:45:44,541 --> 01:45:48,590
And now I know it's just that it's a
total number of posts since Google maps.

1963
01:45:48,650 --> 01:45:50,150
Okay, well I'm, I might have misread it,

1964
01:45:50,151 --> 01:45:53,240
but the one guy who did do it
had a friend in Saudi Arabia.

1965
01:45:53,241 --> 01:45:55,790
He was in Australia where the
store is based on heading to us.

1966
01:45:55,850 --> 01:45:58,490
He's a Australian guy,
but he had a friend in Saudi Arabia.

1967
01:45:58,610 --> 01:46:02,150
So he would give the guy the coordinates
and then the guy would go there and

1968
01:46:02,151 --> 01:46:05,750
take photos of the actual area and
then they would send it to you know,

1969
01:46:05,810 --> 01:46:08,650
experts and they'd be like, yeah, that's
some fucking shit. Right. That's crazy.

1970
01:46:08,651 --> 01:46:11,870
And civilization have any one of these
assholes are throwing rocks at each other

1971
01:46:11,871 --> 01:46:16,790
and fucking screaming about
none my rules. Right. You know,

1972
01:46:16,860 --> 01:46:17,321
they're,

1973
01:46:17,321 --> 01:46:19,850
they're fighting over nonsense over
there when they're in the middle of this

1974
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:22,140
incredible archeological.
Yeah.

1975
01:46:22,280 --> 01:46:26,360
When treasure trove people 12,000 years
ago would pimp slap you for being an

1976
01:46:26,450 --> 01:46:29,150
idiot and they're in the same
place. That's pretty, uh,

1977
01:46:29,890 --> 01:46:33,680
pretty telling there that you're not
going the right way, not the right way.

1978
01:46:33,940 --> 01:46:35,330
You need to change directions.

1979
01:46:35,350 --> 01:46:38,970
You know what's going to happen with
Egypt now with Egypt? Uh, I have,

1980
01:46:38,980 --> 01:46:43,400
I heard the museum's got looted.
Yeah. Kairos just fucking chaos man.

1981
01:46:44,060 --> 01:46:48,800
I mean they have to say ratable
archaeological discoveries
that they have stored

1982
01:46:48,801 --> 01:46:51,570
there. I mean, who knows what's still
there, what they'd been able to protect.

1983
01:46:51,571 --> 01:46:53,490
But apparently it's so bad that you know,

1984
01:46:53,570 --> 01:46:56,970
no one can even get an audit of what's
happened and what hasn't happened.

1985
01:46:57,300 --> 01:47:00,810
We're watching a dictatorship
fall before our eyes.

1986
01:47:01,020 --> 01:47:04,200
And here's the thing to consider and
this is the thing that no one's going to

1987
01:47:04,201 --> 01:47:08,070
tell you when you're watching
all this go down. And you know,

1988
01:47:08,071 --> 01:47:10,440
the United States is like, you
know, we, we need, you know,

1989
01:47:10,480 --> 01:47:15,450
Mubarak should step down immediately and
who's behind this?

1990
01:47:16,060 --> 01:47:18,690
Did you guys do this?
Like, I see the, you know,

1991
01:47:18,691 --> 01:47:22,110
like I see Obama on TV talking
about it and I see, and I'm like,

1992
01:47:22,140 --> 01:47:25,410
who when I was younger I
would say, well, here's this,

1993
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:28,270
here's a group of people that are
raising up against their, their,

1994
01:47:28,300 --> 01:47:29,850
their tyrant leader, right? I mean,

1995
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:32,910
this guy is obviously a dictator
and he needs to be removed.

1996
01:47:33,090 --> 01:47:36,990
But he's been our ally in that area
for a long ass time. Yeah. Okay.

1997
01:47:37,160 --> 01:47:39,720
Why is it that all of a sudden
people are rising against him?

1998
01:47:39,721 --> 01:47:42,600
Why is it w who's organizing all this?
Is the CIA?

1999
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:45,450
Wasn't there a recent election
or something? Wasn't there like,

2000
01:47:45,930 --> 01:47:47,700
I mean that's pretty much it.
In the past it's,

2001
01:47:47,770 --> 01:47:51,260
it's hard to get people to move like
this. It's hard to get people to, uh,

2002
01:47:51,270 --> 01:47:54,570
to really rise up. I mean, for sure
they are pissed off for sure. They are,

2003
01:47:54,600 --> 01:47:57,240
they have had enough of this
fucking Douche bag, you know,

2004
01:47:57,241 --> 01:48:00,030
wanting to run things in
their fucking crazy country.

2005
01:48:00,330 --> 01:48:03,990
But what real people are really afraid
of is that the Sharia law, you know,

2006
01:48:03,991 --> 01:48:08,070
that 64% of Egyptians want
to be governed by Sharia law.

2007
01:48:08,220 --> 01:48:12,960
They want to be governed by Islamic law.
So it's like, man, having this guy out,

2008
01:48:12,961 --> 01:48:14,220
it's not good.
And it's like,

2009
01:48:14,430 --> 01:48:17,670
it is good for the Egyptian people
because they get their own choice. But,

2010
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:19,260
but dejection people,

2011
01:48:19,350 --> 01:48:23,190
even though some of them are progressive
and many of them like Iran and I ran up

2012
01:48:23,220 --> 01:48:27,090
a big percentage of the people don't
want anything to do with the way I ran as

2013
01:48:27,091 --> 01:48:28,830
being perceived by the Western world.

2014
01:48:28,831 --> 01:48:31,860
And they don't want have anything to
do with religious fundamentalism or the

2015
01:48:31,861 --> 01:48:35,370
craziness that has always been associated
with. I ran their young people,

2016
01:48:35,460 --> 01:48:38,550
they listen to fucking music and they
like art and they want to get the fuck out

2017
01:48:38,551 --> 01:48:41,760
of this. There's terrible situation,
but they're stuck. You know?

2018
01:48:41,860 --> 01:48:44,760
And I think there's a lot of those
types of people in Egypt too,

2019
01:48:45,030 --> 01:48:49,330
but it's just like America man. Even if
there's 50% of the people that you know,

2020
01:48:49,350 --> 01:48:53,220
believe that, you know, we need
science and stem cell research is good.

2021
01:48:53,221 --> 01:48:57,330
There's another 50% to believe they saw
fucking the devil in their cheerios and

2022
01:48:57,331 --> 01:48:59,860
they want to fucking shoot it with
a gun. You know? I mean we've got,

2023
01:48:59,900 --> 01:49:02,910
we've got a real problem like that.
I think the only way I've, you know,

2024
01:49:03,010 --> 01:49:07,230
been asked this question before and I
think the best solution I have is just you

2025
01:49:07,231 --> 01:49:10,920
got to set up like Mo drop
Internet over to uh, you know,

2026
01:49:10,921 --> 01:49:13,860
like if people get knowledge and
like see outside of their box,

2027
01:49:13,861 --> 01:49:15,650
that's the only thing that's
going to change their mind. Right.

2028
01:49:15,651 --> 01:49:20,370
You know like put in like
paid for broadband stations
and I closed off area so

2029
01:49:20,371 --> 01:49:22,500
people can go in there,
login and check some shit out.

2030
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:24,900
Well it's interesting like you said that
because that was the first thing that

2031
01:49:24,901 --> 01:49:27,360
they did in Egypt when they
wanted to stop the resistance,

2032
01:49:27,361 --> 01:49:31,200
they shut off the Internet. That's what
Egypt did. They shut off the Internet.

2033
01:49:31,320 --> 01:49:33,370
Is this still off by the way?
I don't know. I don't know.

2034
01:49:33,390 --> 01:49:34,800
I don't know how much of it was off.

2035
01:49:34,801 --> 01:49:37,140
I don't know if they were able to
jury rig it and get it back on.

2036
01:49:37,141 --> 01:49:40,950
I don't even know what it is to be honest
to start talking to me about the Gumbo.

2037
01:49:41,100 --> 01:49:44,340
I don't even understand what the tubes
and pipes and how do you shut it off.

2038
01:49:44,341 --> 01:49:48,250
Is there a main switch somewhere? Did you
blow some shit up? Did you cut the cord?

2039
01:49:48,430 --> 01:49:51,070
Did we run a core through the bottom
of the ocean? All the way to America?

2040
01:49:51,071 --> 01:49:53,530
How the fuck does it get over here?
How does it get over here?

2041
01:49:53,531 --> 01:49:57,190
Is Your cord that goes from underneath
Europe under the owner? Is that real?

2042
01:49:57,220 --> 01:50:01,540
I think there is. That's ridiculous.
How Retro? Yeah, I think there is.

2043
01:50:01,900 --> 01:50:04,010
I think there's, okay. Well how the
fuck did they connect with each other?

2044
01:50:04,060 --> 01:50:08,590
Telephone lines. How do they connect
with each other? We don't know.

2045
01:50:08,740 --> 01:50:13,240
I'm pretty sure I would get bounced by
satellites but not in seventies there's

2046
01:50:13,241 --> 01:50:15,760
no satellites, but I don't think there's
salary. There's no, there was no internet.

2047
01:50:17,190 --> 01:50:17,681
No,
I'm saying,

2048
01:50:17,681 --> 01:50:21,400
but the Internet goes through telephone
lines and like that kind of wiring.

2049
01:50:21,410 --> 01:50:26,140
So you used to be able to call England
from the 70s how the fuck could you do

2050
01:50:26,141 --> 01:50:30,220
that? Back in the 70s you could call
any shirt. The ocean. So fucking deep.

2051
01:50:30,221 --> 01:50:33,480
So what did I do? Put It on loaders.
Yeah. What is due for ships?

2052
01:50:33,490 --> 01:50:35,860
Run into it and cut the cord.
And you gotta do it.

2053
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:38,050
Just whales just hit it and you're like,
Hey,

2054
01:50:38,110 --> 01:50:40,630
I might be talking about on my ass
and maybe I'm just thinking about that

2055
01:50:40,631 --> 01:50:44,470
episode of loss might be targeted at your
ass, but you might not be, but I mean,

2056
01:50:44,471 --> 01:50:47,650
how the fuck could we call England?
Well, you know what, let's,

2057
01:50:47,651 --> 01:50:51,770
let's get as cowboys. Let's get a direct
answer from Twitter. You know I'm gonna,

2058
01:50:51,790 --> 01:50:54,280
I'm going to ask the folks on Twitter,
please tell me like,

2059
01:50:54,281 --> 01:50:59,281
how the fuck are you able to make phone
calls to Europe back in the 70s how the

2060
01:50:59,800 --> 01:51:00,461
fuck was there?

2061
01:51:00,461 --> 01:51:04,060
A cord that went all the way through
the goddamn ocean all the way to Germany

2062
01:51:04,061 --> 01:51:06,460
and shit.
Like I remember seeing a documentary,

2063
01:51:06,490 --> 01:51:08,620
how they did it or something like that.

2064
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:12,820
And I could be just [inaudible]
please Twitter answer, answer me.

2065
01:51:12,850 --> 01:51:16,750
I saw Twitter's like educate
ball irreversible. By the way,

2066
01:51:16,751 --> 01:51:18,730
that the same guy that did it avoid Bingo.

2067
01:51:18,910 --> 01:51:23,560
Charge five photo says there is a
large fiber optic line in the ocean.

2068
01:51:23,650 --> 01:51:27,200
Okay. Here's the question
though. What the fuck man? What?

2069
01:51:27,250 --> 01:51:29,600
What happened back when there
was no fiber optics, right?

2070
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:33,090
What did they do back in the 70s what
do they do in the 50s how did they let,

2071
01:51:33,130 --> 01:51:36,370
I mean, they usually show deep,
like it can't be on the bottom.

2072
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:37,240
Where does that much fun?

2073
01:51:37,330 --> 01:51:42,160
I know what it's probably there's like
chasms in a business that runs through

2074
01:51:42,161 --> 01:51:45,070
there where you think there's a line
in like dudes are on like fucking

2075
01:51:45,071 --> 01:51:46,870
submarines and they see it common like,
shit,

2076
01:51:46,871 --> 01:51:49,600
we gotta we're gonna hit the phone
line or your line to get your tickets.

2077
01:51:49,601 --> 01:51:53,740
You killed the phones in New York.
Man. This guy says there's cables,

2078
01:51:53,800 --> 01:51:58,300
there's a transatlantic cable.
Wow. There was even back then.

2079
01:51:58,301 --> 01:52:01,690
There's a transatlantic
cable and the dude tow bang.

2080
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:05,650
Just sent me a Wiki link.
Fuck yeah man. Holy Shit.

2081
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:10,180
There is a God damn cable that's laid
across the floor of the Atlantic Ocean.

2082
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:13,720
It crossed a telegraphic field.
Whoa. That's pretty dope.

2083
01:52:14,200 --> 01:52:18,820
So this is fascinating shit man. So what
the fuck is it with cell phones then?

2084
01:52:19,150 --> 01:52:21,910
Is that is a piggy piggyback on
those lines. International lines.

2085
01:52:22,410 --> 01:52:25,270
I'm putting in my satellites for cell
phones. How does that work? Yeah,

2086
01:52:25,271 --> 01:52:29,830
I think cell phones uses satellites now.
It does. Yeah. So if you connect from,

2087
01:52:29,910 --> 01:52:33,310
from one Australia to the United States,
I'm pretty sure it uses satellites.

2088
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:36,650
Does that make sense? So, yeah, that's
what my guys, I said that last time I was,

2089
01:52:36,790 --> 01:52:40,990
let's say you Twitter. What? Say
you Twitter, please answer us.

2090
01:52:41,020 --> 01:52:43,100
It's like magic eight ball,
Bro. This is the most of me.

2091
01:52:43,250 --> 01:52:45,980
There's never been a time in life where
you could ask people questions like

2092
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:49,280
this. And it's not even on radio
shows. You can pick a callers. No,

2093
01:52:49,281 --> 01:52:53,900
you get the text answers. Shit. This
guy is saying they sent letters by boat.

2094
01:52:54,020 --> 01:52:57,290
It's a girl. That's a stupid
answer. Shut your mouth.

2095
01:52:57,291 --> 01:53:00,290
You didn't think that shit through it all.
They sent letters by boat.

2096
01:53:00,291 --> 01:53:04,580
We're not talking about the 15
hundreds hooker on boat. Okay. Monkey.

2097
01:53:04,581 --> 01:53:08,570
Todd says it was a wire.
It was copper wire originally.

2098
01:53:09,230 --> 01:53:11,750
But what about what they're
doing right now? I mean,

2099
01:53:11,751 --> 01:53:14,840
how the fuck is it work right now
when you're sending, um, you know,

2100
01:53:14,841 --> 01:53:18,260
when you're sending a cell phone message
or calling someone, how's that work?

2101
01:53:19,220 --> 01:53:24,100
As of 2004, there's been
underwater cables, Huh? Yeah.

2102
01:53:24,140 --> 01:53:27,230
Cell phones use radio
signals. Yes. On Earth.

2103
01:53:27,231 --> 01:53:29,300
But radio doesn't go across the ocean.
You can't,

2104
01:53:29,720 --> 01:53:31,040
you don't even know what
the fuck was Cheyenne.

2105
01:53:31,080 --> 01:53:35,430
Goddammit taps into the same lines that,
yeah,

2106
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:38,570
I would imagine it has to
use satellites nowadays.

2107
01:53:39,150 --> 01:53:41,570
Why there's a delay in the satellites.

2108
01:53:41,571 --> 01:53:44,300
It's gotta go way the fuck up to the
sky now. Because then if that was true,

2109
01:53:44,301 --> 01:53:49,040
there'd be no of like gaming, you know,
sells phones, use regular phone lines.

2110
01:53:49,041 --> 01:53:50,060
Apparently this guy saying

2111
01:53:51,590 --> 01:53:54,520
piggy backs somehow on regular
phone lines. Pinterest, you know,

2112
01:53:54,521 --> 01:53:57,380
it's kind of fucked up. It's just
like we were talking about with, um,

2113
01:53:57,470 --> 01:54:00,890
when your website gets a lot of
hits and it correct. By the way,

2114
01:54:00,891 --> 01:54:04,520
warrior poet is crushed son.
That shit ain't coming back.

2115
01:54:05,750 --> 01:54:08,030
If I could serve it just took a deep six.

2116
01:54:08,090 --> 01:54:11,750
I only have your business websites
crushed, but it's the same way with um,

2117
01:54:11,780 --> 01:54:14,230
with cell phone signals.
If there's an earthquake or some shit,

2118
01:54:14,240 --> 01:54:16,760
everybody tries to use their
phone. Good luck. Good luck.

2119
01:54:16,761 --> 01:54:19,730
You won't be able to use it
because everybody can't use
the phone at one stadium.

2120
01:54:19,850 --> 01:54:23,060
Yeah. It's like you're
there, they're under stocked,

2121
01:54:23,061 --> 01:54:26,300
like they're selling you cell
phone service and they're
selling it to everybody.

2122
01:54:26,301 --> 01:54:28,670
But the only way it works is that
everybody hasn't used it at the same time.

2123
01:54:28,810 --> 01:54:31,580
Yeah. Cause if everybody uses it at
the same time, nobody gets to use it.

2124
01:54:31,581 --> 01:54:35,830
It just shits out and just fucking
farts and dies. That's annoying.

2125
01:54:36,680 --> 01:54:41,090
That's annoying. It's like we, we're
um, we're too far ahead of ourselves.

2126
01:54:41,300 --> 01:54:45,490
You know, when it comes to technology,
we're too far out there. We're,

2127
01:54:45,491 --> 01:54:48,710
we're fucking try to stick this graph
on your message board of all the

2128
01:54:48,711 --> 01:54:53,270
underwater cables. Have you seen, did
you see that? Whoa, that's dope. A lot.

2129
01:54:53,271 --> 01:54:54,940
And that's a,
that's only my goddamn message boards.

2130
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:58,340
[inaudible] we have to fix that shit.
It was getting crushed so much.

2131
01:54:58,341 --> 01:55:02,660
It's still private after I had to make
it where you only a member can you look

2132
01:55:02,661 --> 01:55:02,990
at it.

2133
01:55:02,990 --> 01:55:06,320
So you have to sign up for it to look
that up here that says there's been 150

2134
01:55:06,321 --> 01:55:10,130
years of Trans Trans Land at cable.
Wow.

2135
01:55:10,160 --> 01:55:14,120
150 150 years. That's insane.
Well, how the fuck did they do?

2136
01:55:14,121 --> 01:55:18,020
And if they go up higher through like uh,
they're floating on algae,

2137
01:55:18,110 --> 01:55:22,360
northern part of Canada and over through,
or if they're just straight through,

2138
01:55:22,380 --> 01:55:26,210
it comes right out of New York.
That's incredible.

2139
01:55:26,750 --> 01:55:27,411
That's incredible.

2140
01:55:27,411 --> 01:55:32,090
That's 150 years of monster cables to how
long did it take to make those fucking

2141
01:55:32,091 --> 01:55:35,810
cables? Jesus Christ.
How long is it to get to,

2142
01:55:35,811 --> 01:55:40,670
if you take a boat from New York to
England, how long is that? How many miles?

2143
01:55:41,180 --> 01:55:44,280
Thousands of miles. Like
1500 miles. One cable.

2144
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:47,400
That's thousands of miles long.
What the fuck do you carry that

2145
01:55:47,460 --> 01:55:50,970
hang on? 1500 no. Yeah, it's
like three. Yeah, take six hours.

2146
01:55:52,010 --> 01:55:54,930
Planes Go, what? 500
miles an hour. You know,

2147
01:55:54,931 --> 01:55:58,710
so what the fuck do you carry that with?
What do you carry that cable with?

2148
01:55:58,890 --> 01:56:03,030
You know, just had to be boats, getting
supplies and metal and then just try.

2149
01:56:03,031 --> 01:56:06,870
I just don't understand how they avoided
the chasms in the water. Like, Oh shit.

2150
01:56:07,170 --> 01:56:08,010
Like here's,
you know,

2151
01:56:08,011 --> 01:56:11,060
when you're fishing in the thing just
keeps going down and had a deep part of

2152
01:56:11,080 --> 01:56:14,810
lake or the parts of the ocean
are like 10,000 feet, you know,

2153
01:56:14,990 --> 01:56:18,630
a [inaudible] type stuff and wondering
why haven't terrorists try to attack that

2154
01:56:18,631 --> 01:56:19,464
cable?

2155
01:56:20,700 --> 01:56:24,510
Oh Shit. Fuck. [inaudible] brainstorming.

2156
01:56:25,110 --> 01:56:28,260
These dumb cunts are living in fucking
rock houses in the middle of the

2157
01:56:28,261 --> 01:56:32,490
mountains, banging goats and shit. Do
you think they can think this through?

2158
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:36,290
We're didn't go do ocean and caught the
k but it are gone to kill farm there.

2159
01:56:36,310 --> 01:56:39,390
We gotta we gotta get, we gotta
get them online. That's the bottom.

2160
01:56:39,391 --> 01:56:41,700
We've got to get everybody. Well, you
know what you gotta do. Here's that deal.

2161
01:56:41,810 --> 01:56:44,540
Not just get them online. They have
to be around cool people. Dermabond,

2162
01:56:44,590 --> 01:56:46,550
douchebags.
Everyone around them is a douchebag.

2163
01:56:46,790 --> 01:56:49,950
It mean especially like in the Middle
East, the Middle East is just chaos,

2164
01:56:49,960 --> 01:56:53,550
Middle East or the townies of the world.
That's the cradle of civilization.

2165
01:56:53,551 --> 01:56:57,750
That's where it all started. And that's
why they're so behind the times. I mean,

2166
01:56:57,770 --> 01:57:00,600
the, the reason they're behind the
times and the reason why the America,

2167
01:57:00,810 --> 01:57:04,410
America is supposedly the most
progressive of the most advanced,

2168
01:57:04,411 --> 01:57:07,950
at least culturally of all the other
countries. The reason is because we're,

2169
01:57:07,951 --> 01:57:12,480
the last one were the one where everybody
fled to. And the first one, which is,

2170
01:57:12,481 --> 01:57:15,870
you know, the Middle East Mesopotamia
where Iraq is, that's the worst.

2171
01:57:15,900 --> 01:57:18,570
That's where it's the most fucked up.
That's the Sharia law.

2172
01:57:18,571 --> 01:57:21,390
That's Muslims versus Muslims.
That's, you know, chaos.

2173
01:57:21,391 --> 01:57:24,590
That's all those fucking dudes wearing
robes, circling around, you know, the,

2174
01:57:24,591 --> 01:57:29,160
the hodge at the mosque in Saudi
Arabia or whatever it is, the a mecca.

2175
01:57:29,610 --> 01:57:31,380
I mean,
that's all the same shit.

2176
01:57:31,381 --> 01:57:35,160
That's all that stuff that's been
around too long. You know. You know,

2177
01:57:35,161 --> 01:57:36,630
I was saying when we watched that,
um,

2178
01:57:37,260 --> 01:57:41,430
there was a TV show when I was
in Germany and a 24 hour, um,

2179
01:57:41,550 --> 01:57:43,920
Mecca station.
And it just 24 hours.

2180
01:57:43,921 --> 01:57:47,280
That's all it shows is people
circling the the box in Mecca,

2181
01:57:47,370 --> 01:57:50,550
circling that big square building. It's
crazy. It's fucking, but I was like,

2182
01:57:50,551 --> 01:57:53,610
if that she had happened today,
okay, if this is a new cult,

2183
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:56,580
if some new Scientology type thing and
everybody's wearing robes and their

2184
01:57:56,581 --> 01:58:00,310
circle in that box, we'd be like, Whoa,
we got to stop these motherfuckers.

2185
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:03,740
That is scary. If that, could you
imagine if that was in America? It looks,

2186
01:58:03,750 --> 01:58:05,760
say if that was in Kansas and there was,

2187
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:10,050
you saw Bryant Gumbel disturbance
footage today out of Kansas.

2188
01:58:10,140 --> 01:58:13,260
We're going to go live here. Now,
granted, Ladies and gentlemen,

2189
01:58:13,261 --> 01:58:17,700
let's be aware of this. This dangerous
cult has only been around for five years,

2190
01:58:17,820 --> 01:58:21,390
but look how much they've organized in
these five years and then they showed

2191
01:58:21,391 --> 01:58:23,300
people Cirque around those boxes.
Dude,

2192
01:58:23,310 --> 01:58:26,550
there'd be helicopters flying towards
that to where we are right now.

2193
01:58:26,551 --> 01:58:29,340
Tanks would be moving down the highway.
Check

2194
01:58:29,340 --> 01:58:30,173
this out.
What if we,

2195
01:58:30,180 --> 01:58:35,180
what if we created a call that would
drink the blood of their hero every,

2196
01:58:35,670 --> 01:58:39,240
every, every week, figuratively,
if it was Megan Fox as well.

2197
01:58:39,690 --> 01:58:42,040
But that's what's happening.
Like you go to Catholic mass,

2198
01:58:42,041 --> 01:58:45,970
it's like here's the blood, here's the
flesh, drink the blood, eat the flesh.

2199
01:58:46,120 --> 01:58:50,230
I mean that's the look at that. That's
pagan. That is big and stuff right there.

2200
01:58:50,231 --> 01:58:53,290
But all but it because it's, Oh,
it's Christianity, it's Catholic.

2201
01:58:53,291 --> 01:58:56,090
Like we have a weird thing where
we just get used to shit. Yeah.

2202
01:58:56,230 --> 01:58:59,280
No matter how wacky it is,
you know, it's like these,

2203
01:58:59,320 --> 01:59:02,780
these broads in Africa with these
plates in their lips, you know,

2204
01:59:03,320 --> 01:59:05,980
Africa is another place where they
need some information. Like the,

2205
01:59:05,981 --> 01:59:09,220
especially in the mass side cultures and
stuff where they're getting their clits

2206
01:59:09,221 --> 01:59:10,810
cutoff with sharp stones.

2207
01:59:11,110 --> 01:59:13,840
The clutter ectomy out there like
they needed to do too, by the way.

2208
01:59:13,841 --> 01:59:16,210
They do a lot of that need
to see like Hannah Montana,

2209
01:59:16,211 --> 01:59:21,211
I'm like totally all need
Twitter addresses me bouncing
around singing whatever.

2210
01:59:21,390 --> 01:59:24,310
Isama been loud. It needs to check
in at four square at the Applebee's.

2211
01:59:24,311 --> 01:59:26,620
So we can fuck them up.
You know when they all need that shit.

2212
01:59:29,350 --> 01:59:30,760
Well, they already fucked him up, man.

2213
01:59:32,160 --> 01:59:35,250
Do you ever think that guy's alive?
I have no idea if he's even real.

2214
01:59:35,930 --> 01:59:38,160
It's probably in a fucking
London hotel somewhere.

2215
01:59:38,860 --> 01:59:42,630
A gang of boys sucking his dick.
They probably just said, listen,

2216
01:59:42,660 --> 01:59:44,730
we're not going to kill you, which
is, we're going to keep you alive.

2217
01:59:45,210 --> 01:59:47,970
You can make them every couple of years.
I need you in video.

2218
01:59:48,110 --> 01:59:52,470
Need you to come out with a new scary shit
so we can segway more civil liberties.

2219
01:59:52,500 --> 01:59:55,650
Do you think the last time that
there was real evil in a, in a,

2220
01:59:55,890 --> 01:59:59,670
in a war that we fought World
War II? Do you? Yeah, no,

2221
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:03,270
I think there's real evil in Islamic
fundamentalism and Islamic terrorism.

2222
02:00:03,271 --> 02:00:04,500
I think there's definitely real evil.

2223
02:00:04,501 --> 02:00:08,520
I think the problem is unfortunately a
lot of that real evil has been caused by

2224
02:00:08,570 --> 02:00:11,490
our manipulation. Right?
Our being in, you know,

2225
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:15,660
in religious holy grounds, you
know, and desecrated those grounds,

2226
02:00:15,661 --> 02:00:20,310
our involvement with and support
of dictators in the Islamic world.

2227
02:00:20,610 --> 02:00:23,070
And you know, some people say
like, guys like Hosni Mubarak,

2228
02:00:23,071 --> 02:00:25,520
like we need that guy around
to keep deal is, you know,

2229
02:00:25,560 --> 02:00:27,510
the Islamic fundamentalists
from gaining power.

2230
02:00:27,720 --> 02:00:30,480
Like at least he's like more moderate.
And even though it's he's a dictator,

2231
02:00:30,481 --> 02:00:33,270
it's the better of two evils.
And yeah, I don't know man.

2232
02:00:33,271 --> 02:00:36,320
I'm not well versed enough to
be realistically, you know, to,

2233
02:00:36,321 --> 02:00:39,060
to be honest about it. You know? I
mean if you really step back and said,

2234
02:00:39,061 --> 02:00:41,970
do you really understand how things
work in the Middle East? No. Fuck No.

2235
02:00:41,971 --> 02:00:44,220
I know that's another world.
It's another world man.

2236
02:00:44,470 --> 02:00:48,030
Maybe I remember him going to Abu Dhabi
and it becomes very aware, you know,

2237
02:00:48,031 --> 02:00:51,330
when we did a UFC and I would, I'd be
like, Yo, this is another world, you know,

2238
02:00:51,600 --> 02:00:54,050
don't get stupid, don't get
mouthy at the airport. You know,

2239
02:00:54,060 --> 02:00:55,890
they'll put you in a box on,
you know,

2240
02:00:55,891 --> 02:00:59,010
you'd better be polite and you better
realize that your laws or you know,

2241
02:00:59,040 --> 02:01:02,280
these laws rather very
different than yours. So out
of balance, I think, you know,

2242
02:01:02,281 --> 02:01:05,790
part of it is these patriarchal,
paternalistic religions. You know,

2243
02:01:05,820 --> 02:01:08,340
they just shift everything
way out of balance. You know,

2244
02:01:08,341 --> 02:01:11,790
like there used to be that balance of
the sacred feminine and the masculine,

2245
02:01:12,030 --> 02:01:15,900
but these desert religions are just
just shit on the feminine, you know?

2246
02:01:15,901 --> 02:01:17,970
And it's all about men,
you know,

2247
02:01:17,971 --> 02:01:20,760
control the women buying
the women hide the women.

2248
02:01:20,820 --> 02:01:23,520
Do you think that's because they
don't have much friends like water and

2249
02:01:23,521 --> 02:01:25,180
resources and natural?
Yeah.

2250
02:01:25,181 --> 02:01:29,070
I mean then all of a sudden they've got
this new resource over the last couple

2251
02:01:29,070 --> 02:01:31,290
of hundred years oil, you know,
that's really kind of a man. I mean,

2252
02:01:31,291 --> 02:01:32,400
how long has it even been,

2253
02:01:32,401 --> 02:01:35,950
has it even been a couple of hundred
years that we've been getting oil from the

2254
02:01:35,950 --> 02:01:40,260
Middle East, but whatever it's been, I
mean you look at photos of a Dubai 1970s

2255
02:01:40,270 --> 02:01:42,850
posted today. Back then there
was like nothing going on there.

2256
02:01:42,870 --> 02:01:47,210
Now it's fucking amends.
Sure. Well, assumption has
risen so dramatically. Yeah.

2257
02:01:47,211 --> 02:01:50,450
So it's like they were always in this
terrible situation that they're very few

2258
02:01:50,451 --> 02:01:55,160
resources in a natural resources, at
least certain, you know, not much water,

2259
02:01:55,370 --> 02:01:59,420
you know, kind of a fucked up area. And
now all of a sudden it's just bounty,

2260
02:01:59,570 --> 02:02:01,640
bounty,
money and Mercedes.

2261
02:02:01,641 --> 02:02:05,390
And everywhere you look is Ferrari's
and Mercedes and Ferrari. Yeah. Do,

2262
02:02:05,410 --> 02:02:08,380
we're in Abu Dhabi and who God is.
You never seen guy,

2263
02:02:08,450 --> 02:02:12,920
you never seen so many fucking
Bentleys and rolls Royces. Oh,

2264
02:02:12,921 --> 02:02:15,910
there's some so big pimpin
going on up in this desert.

2265
02:02:15,911 --> 02:02:18,630
Or there was an article recently where
they were talking about how they've

2266
02:02:18,880 --> 02:02:19,390
either,

2267
02:02:19,390 --> 02:02:22,550
they're admitting that they're making it
rain and I with Dobie that they made it

2268
02:02:22,551 --> 02:02:26,960
rain 52 times this year,
throwing money in the air. Oh,

2269
02:02:28,420 --> 02:02:31,520
what did that, what, what Jackson had
read, you know what I mean? Like, no,

2270
02:02:31,521 --> 02:02:33,330
they just make it rain on the photo.

2271
02:02:33,510 --> 02:02:37,130
That photos of these guys in their
traditional garb outside with umbrellas,

2272
02:02:37,160 --> 02:02:39,830
you know, standing in front of a
Bentley, by the way, one of the photos,

2273
02:02:40,060 --> 02:02:40,701
it's hilarious.

2274
02:02:40,701 --> 02:02:44,510
Dudes in front of a Bentley with a
fucking is crazy Arab outfit on holding an

2275
02:02:44,511 --> 02:02:47,630
umbrella. I almost bought you
one of those outfits by the way.

2276
02:02:47,631 --> 02:02:48,680
Gave me one one off there.

2277
02:02:48,681 --> 02:02:50,940
I just didn't have enough to be with
my luggage to bring it back with man.

2278
02:02:50,941 --> 02:02:52,520
Fortunately,
yeah,

2279
02:02:52,580 --> 02:02:57,060
I pack just to the point where I just
got just enough to get through. Yeah.

2280
02:02:57,230 --> 02:03:00,410
You know, I don't want to, I don't have
no room to be bringing shit back with me.

2281
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:04,490
That's my latest thing. I don't check
bags. I just put, I just bring a carry on.

2282
02:03:04,730 --> 02:03:06,530
I try to even want to,
it's like a three or four day trip.

2283
02:03:06,531 --> 02:03:09,800
I just try to get as little clothes in
there as possible and I'm like, look,

2284
02:03:09,830 --> 02:03:12,800
everywhere you can buy
underwear everywhere. You can
buy socks. Right. How do I,

2285
02:03:12,830 --> 02:03:15,320
how do I cut this down
to the minimum? Why? Why?

2286
02:03:15,770 --> 02:03:19,360
Because when you're waiting in line at
that fucking the the baggage thing and

2287
02:03:19,370 --> 02:03:22,070
wondering if your shit's ever going to
come out and let thought it's my favorite

2288
02:03:22,071 --> 02:03:25,130
shirt and fuck now I can't get it.
Now I've got to go buy toothpaste.

2289
02:03:25,131 --> 02:03:26,520
It's not the baggage fees though,
right?

2290
02:03:30,110 --> 02:03:34,550
You got me. You got me. I'm traveling
across the world trying to save 10 bucks

2291
02:03:37,010 --> 02:03:40,100
fucking bag.
Anything else before we get out of here?

2292
02:03:41,240 --> 02:03:42,920
Pretty much over right.
What time is it?

2293
02:03:42,921 --> 02:03:47,260
Five 17 or two hours in two
hours. I'm like 15 minutes. Yeah.

2294
02:03:47,300 --> 02:03:50,990
Well thank you everybody for tuning in
and thank you very much for the, um,

2295
02:03:51,290 --> 02:03:53,870
the questions that were
answered on Twitter.

2296
02:03:54,320 --> 02:03:58,610
Satellites are used to transfer data
overseas and the Internet is back on in

2297
02:03:58,611 --> 02:04:02,660
Egypt. So says satellite,
Mister Monkey man.

2298
02:04:02,720 --> 02:04:04,460
Eight one eight one eight.

2299
02:04:04,640 --> 02:04:08,390
Why is there so many monkey people
on my set of coincidence? Oh,

2300
02:04:08,391 --> 02:04:10,490
if you were looking for
higher primates shirts,

2301
02:04:10,550 --> 02:04:14,000
a higher-primate.com my clothing line,
we've got a,

2302
02:04:14,001 --> 02:04:16,430
we sold out like way quicker
than I thought we're going to.

2303
02:04:16,431 --> 02:04:19,490
And that's why unfortunately
a lot of, uh, the, the, uh,

2304
02:04:19,910 --> 02:04:21,560
designs have not been in stock,

2305
02:04:21,740 --> 02:04:24,050
but we'll restocking them and
I've got a bunch of new dope ones.

2306
02:04:24,050 --> 02:04:24,791
They're fucking killer.

2307
02:04:24,791 --> 02:04:28,460
I've got to show you some new
ones that we got crazy shit. Um,

2308
02:04:28,730 --> 02:04:33,110
this weekend we're going to be at
sales comedy hole in La next weekend.

2309
02:04:33,111 --> 02:04:34,820
The Bray Improv,
that's a,

2310
02:04:34,821 --> 02:04:39,440
I believe that's Friday,
Saturday and Sunday.

2311
02:04:39,470 --> 02:04:40,530
I think it's Friday.
Saturday,

2312
02:04:40,531 --> 02:04:44,670
Sunday two shows Friday two shows Saturday
one show Sunday as I would have is I

2313
02:04:44,671 --> 02:04:47,610
believe so. I'll tell you
right now. Yes you are correct.

2314
02:04:47,790 --> 02:04:50,880
And his white before Washington's
birthday, which is Monday, we should,

2315
02:04:50,881 --> 02:04:54,150
we should all celebrate together.
Yeah. The last year was a bad ass.

2316
02:04:54,180 --> 02:04:58,890
Great President with his wooden teeth
growing weed and bang and slaves.

2317
02:04:59,640 --> 02:05:04,500
Slaves, didn't he? Yeah. Crazy world. We
live in folks. Huh? Probably had kids,

2318
02:05:04,501 --> 02:05:06,720
but I don't think so. They all
did. Didn't they all shot loads?

2319
02:05:06,970 --> 02:05:08,400
Do you think wives get pissed off?

2320
02:05:08,430 --> 02:05:11,030
You see this mocha babies wandering
around their yard going in there and

2321
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:13,290
motherfucker different after you're
married to George Washington.

2322
02:05:13,290 --> 02:05:16,860
Martha was like, man, my fucking has
really just kept her fucking mouth shut.

2323
02:05:17,280 --> 02:05:19,860

gig. You know. Come on, man.

2325

Who the fuck is Betsy were up?
Where's Mr. Ross?

2326
02:05:26,260 --> 02:05:30,480
You don't even hear shit about Mr. Ross
because George Washington is laying that

2327

And he'll be on Thursday.
Thank you very much to Chris.

2339
02:06:11,160 --> 02:06:15,660
If you go to Chris's website when, when
the fight is over or it's fucking dead.

2340
02:06:15,661 --> 02:06:20,460
Dude, I tried to refresh.
We will be resurrected with
your business website again.

2341
02:06:20,490 --> 02:06:24,310
[inaudible] dot com in it.com oh,
it's up.

2342
02:06:24,330 --> 02:06:27,750
I got on Socrates would kick your ass
and we saw she would paint a nude of your

2343
02:06:27,751 --> 02:06:30,110
girlfriend. That's
what's a new blog, blog.

2344
02:06:30,120 --> 02:06:34,620
Nine Socrates was probably the most
underrated philosopher I think. And uh,

2345
02:06:34,830 --> 02:06:37,940
in that time period, I really, you just
look at, his work is underrated though.

2346
02:06:38,260 --> 02:06:41,700
The philosopher really is, is a
warrior. He's, he's, you know,

2347
02:06:41,850 --> 02:06:44,010
loud it like everybody
knows he was bad ass.

2348
02:06:44,030 --> 02:06:48,150
I mean he carved in or in a car to staff
out of an aura and beat the demon of

2349
02:06:48,151 --> 02:06:49,740
the western province. It's
like, people know that,

2350
02:06:49,741 --> 02:06:52,050
but I don't think he's got even mean.
You know,

2351
02:06:52,070 --> 02:06:55,710
you don't have out of an or what's
an or like a like a rope, like a, Oh,

2352
02:06:55,711 --> 02:06:59,410
in order to row boats carved. Just
standing here before and have more of a,

2353
02:06:59,430 --> 02:07:00,640
beat the shit out of somebody with it.
Yeah.

2354
02:07:00,840 --> 02:07:03,090
He was going to fight the
demon of the western provinces.

2355
02:07:03,150 --> 02:07:06,120
But does that mean right? Some
dude, he had a, he had a reputation,

2356
02:07:06,121 --> 02:07:09,510
some killer basically, you know,
out there that was a Samurai.

2357
02:07:09,720 --> 02:07:12,360
Is that what you're saying? Yeah, that's
the Samurais would fight each other. Uh,

2358
02:07:12,580 --> 02:07:15,510
but Socrates you're talking about when
I was talking about Sasha. Oh, okay.

2359
02:07:15,880 --> 02:07:20,640
You said Socrates did I baffled
the fuck confused cause I was like,

2360
02:07:20,730 --> 02:07:24,190
I just the opposite. Everybody knew
that Musashi was a warrior for sure.

2361
02:07:25,080 --> 02:07:27,590
Socrates was a warrior to Socrates.
Yeah,

2362
02:07:28,110 --> 02:07:30,930
definitely think that Musashi was one
of the most underrated philosophers.

2363
02:07:30,931 --> 02:07:32,560
That's where this whole tattoo came from.
Man,

2364
02:07:32,561 --> 02:07:36,070
this is Musashi and it's
based on that quote that stuck

2365
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:37,540
with me my whole life.
Then I read when I was,

2366
02:07:37,541 --> 02:07:40,720
I think like 17 that once you
understand the way broadly,

2367
02:07:40,721 --> 02:07:44,410
you see it in all things.
Yeah, exactly. And I think one
of the most done, and I'll,

2368
02:07:44,480 --> 02:07:47,260
he's a great artist too.
I think people don't know about that.

2369
02:07:47,261 --> 02:07:48,910
They just know that he kicked ass.
You know,

2370
02:07:48,911 --> 02:07:52,210
what people don't understand is that
that was the Samurai way is that you are,

2371
02:07:52,240 --> 02:07:54,760
you were to be balanced and it wasn't,
you know,

2372
02:07:54,761 --> 02:07:58,810
you weren't just a thug out there killing
people, but to be a Great Samurai,

2373
02:07:58,811 --> 02:08:02,740
to be so well versed that you could kill
men and one on one hand to hand combat,

2374
02:08:02,741 --> 02:08:06,280
which he did over 64 times,
killed people in duels,

2375
02:08:06,610 --> 02:08:09,210
that he had to be completely
balanced. You know, he had,

2376
02:08:09,230 --> 02:08:12,340
he believed that you had to be great at
calligraphy. You had to be great at art,

2377
02:08:12,341 --> 02:08:13,720
you gotta be great at poetry.
You know,

2378
02:08:13,721 --> 02:08:16,750
you had to have this incredible same
principles that made them great at

2379
02:08:16,751 --> 02:08:17,260
swordplay,

2380
02:08:17,260 --> 02:08:21,560
could make degrade at anything and the
same principles that made you lazy or

2381
02:08:21,561 --> 02:08:24,940
fucked you up or gave you a
shitty character would cost
you your life in battle.

2382
02:08:24,970 --> 02:08:26,800
Yeah. Which is so true, man. You know,

2383
02:08:26,801 --> 02:08:30,430
and martial artists are starting to
realize that too. Is that all? Any,

2384
02:08:30,431 --> 02:08:34,780
any negative energy that you take?
Any, any suggish, Douchey, bullshit.

2385
02:08:34,930 --> 02:08:38,200
You have to account for that in your
own assessment of who you are as a human

2386
02:08:38,201 --> 02:08:41,230
being, you know, and to, to be truly zen,

2387
02:08:41,410 --> 02:08:44,260
you have to really have all
your bases covered to really,

2388
02:08:44,261 --> 02:08:46,960
truly in the moment and truly
great at anything. You know,

2389
02:08:46,961 --> 02:08:51,590
you've got to be balanced in all
areas, right? For, and folks out there,

2390
02:08:51,600 --> 02:08:54,700
too rare. You've got to surround yourself
with positive fucking people. Okay?

2391
02:08:54,701 --> 02:08:56,410
And the best way to do this,
the only way to do this,

2392
02:08:56,420 --> 02:08:58,900
you've got to become positive yourself.
I know it's difficult. It's not easy.

2393
02:08:58,901 --> 02:09:01,480
Yoga socks, it's fucking, there's
a lot of checks fart in that class.

2394
02:09:01,840 --> 02:09:04,240
But you gotta go, you gotta go to
Yoga Class, you've got to read things.

2395
02:09:04,241 --> 02:09:07,180
Gotta eat healthy. You gotta exercise,
you've gotta get your mind right.

2396
02:09:07,181 --> 02:09:11,080
Read books, get up early and run even
though you don't want to. All right,

2397
02:09:11,081 --> 02:09:14,620
do chin ups before you eat breakfast.
Do something. Get your shit together,

2398
02:09:14,621 --> 02:09:17,740
bitches. And if you get your shit
together, you will attract other people.

2399
02:09:17,741 --> 02:09:21,190
Also have their shit together. That is how
I became friends with Chris. All right.

2400
02:09:21,310 --> 02:09:25,480
We have attracted each other. Okay. That's
how Brian came here from fucking Ohio,

2401
02:09:25,481 --> 02:09:29,830
right, Brian? Yeah, that's
right. Okay, folks, it's fucking
show is over. God dammit.

2402
02:09:29,950 --> 02:09:33,130
I'm trying to give you a pep talk
and I'm putting myself to sleep. Um,

comedy whole next weekend. Bray Improv.

2404
