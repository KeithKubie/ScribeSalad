&gt;&gt;Richard: You're mom's outside,
your mom's right there, Madison.

00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.576
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The CARE
for Kids initiative aims

00:00:13.576 --> 00:00:15.606
to create supportive relationships

00:00:15.636 --> 00:00:18.916
between Jefferson County
students, teachers and staff.

00:00:18.916 --> 00:00:21.276
&gt;&gt;Principal: Hello, sweet girl,
you have a good day, okay?

00:00:21.756 --> 00:00:24.286
&gt;&gt;Narrator: So everyone at
Breckenridge Franklin Elementary,

00:00:24.506 --> 00:00:28.216
from the principal to the
janitorial staff, receives training

00:00:28.296 --> 00:00:30.496
to become part of the
CARE for Kids team.

00:00:31.076 --> 00:00:31.646
&gt;&gt;What's wrong?

00:00:32.156 --> 00:00:35.536
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Security monitor, Richard
Little, shared his perspective

00:00:35.696 --> 00:00:37.516
on the success of the initiative.

00:00:37.656 --> 00:00:39.976
&gt;&gt;Richard: When I was going
to school, it was old school.

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:44.066
Boys and girls, all right,
they'd get paddlings.

00:00:44.996 --> 00:00:46.636
That's when you come out
in the hallway and you turn

00:00:46.636 --> 00:00:49.296
and face the hallway,
everything else is behind.

00:00:49.296 --> 00:00:53.736
They got the paddle, and they
coming from here, swinging,

00:00:54.286 --> 00:00:55.606
you know, maybe two or three.

00:00:55.676 --> 00:00:58.476
It all depends on the
severity of what you done.

00:00:58.956 --> 00:01:01.226
&gt;&gt;Yeah, I don't see him
yet, wait just a minute.

00:01:01.226 --> 00:01:07.636
&gt;&gt;Education was real great because
you had people that cared, all right,

00:01:08.016 --> 00:01:09.856
and nurtured you in school.

00:01:09.856 --> 00:01:14.006
I loved it because the simple
fact is, you live right

00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:15.736
in your own community, you know.

00:01:16.286 --> 00:01:21.396
And so if I did anything that you
felt that I didn't need to do walking

00:01:21.396 --> 00:01:24.636
down the street, you could
get me, and then my mom

00:01:24.636 --> 00:01:27.896
and my grandma would get a telephone
call, then they could get me.

00:01:28.546 --> 00:01:30.726
And the teachers could
get you, you know.

00:01:31.156 --> 00:01:34.336
So it was always somebody that
were with you that nurtured you.

00:01:34.676 --> 00:01:36.116
&gt;&gt;Stay together, see
you all tomorrow.

00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:37.596
Have a good day.

00:01:38.236 --> 00:01:41.746
&gt;&gt;And today we have a cell
phone, seven year olds

00:01:41.746 --> 00:01:44.146
and eight year olds are
getting, and they're texting.

00:01:44.506 --> 00:01:46.916
You know, they're on the computers
all day and all night, you know,

00:01:47.536 --> 00:01:50.476
and so they really don't get
what they really need at home

00:01:50.476 --> 00:01:54.266
because simple fact is, they've
got all this technology, all right?

00:01:54.386 --> 00:01:56.116
Well, when they're in the
elementary school right here

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:58.966
in Breckenridge Franklin,
they get everything they need.

00:01:59.926 --> 00:02:03.506
Everything they need, because you
have a staff here that's a family,

00:02:03.956 --> 00:02:05.696
all right, and it's
not about a friendship,

00:02:05.696 --> 00:02:07.196
it's about a relationship.

00:02:07.196 --> 00:02:08.616
&gt;&gt;Stay over there with Page.

00:02:08.906 --> 00:02:12.586
&gt;&gt;I was invited to a faculty
meeting, and on that particular day,

00:02:12.826 --> 00:02:15.606
that's when they introduced
the CARE for Kids program.

00:02:16.006 --> 00:02:18.856
And what overwhelmed me
was, they were talking

00:02:18.856 --> 00:02:23.656
about children being left
behind, and I know how I grew up,

00:02:23.656 --> 00:02:26.736
and how people cared
for us, you know.

00:02:26.736 --> 00:02:29.586
I mean, anybody in the
neighborhood, it was like,

00:02:30.156 --> 00:02:31.786
one child, one village, you know.

00:02:32.016 --> 00:02:37.856
So I told them, I said, "You
know what, I like this program"

00:02:37.856 --> 00:02:41.066
and I see this program that's
being implemented and it works,

00:02:42.426 --> 00:02:44.976
because I was here and
I seen it for myself.

00:02:45.616 --> 00:02:48.566
I seen things other parents
wouldn't be able to see.

00:02:48.566 --> 00:02:50.196
&gt;&gt;My teacher teaches terrifically.

00:02:50.276 --> 00:02:51.886
&gt;&gt;I like that alliteration too.

00:02:51.886 --> 00:02:52.996
&gt;&gt;Richard: I know for a fact

00:02:53.176 --> 00:02:55.856
that these teachers here are
doing everything they can

00:02:55.856 --> 00:02:59.746
to keep these children from
being left behind, and they do it

00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:01.716
because it's a mission for them.

00:03:01.896 --> 00:03:04.746
And every child that walks through
that door, I guarantee them,

00:03:05.126 --> 00:03:06.056
they're not gonna be left behind.

00:03:06.916 --> 00:03:09.676
So whoever started this
program, I take my hat off

00:03:09.676 --> 00:03:11.206
to 'em, because it works.

00:03:12.386 --> 00:03:14.176
&gt;&gt;Richard: CARE for Kids works.

00:03:14.716 --> 00:03:16.696
CARE for Kids will
work at any school,

00:03:17.256 --> 00:03:20.496
as long as you got a great
staff and a great leader.

00:03:20.556 --> 00:03:27.896
At the end of the day, those kids
getting on those buses with a smile

00:03:27.896 --> 00:03:31.596
on their face, my job is done.

00:03:33.266 --> 00:03:35.216
I can safely go home
and say, "You know what,

00:03:35.926 --> 00:03:38.136
when they came this
morning, they had smiles,

00:03:38.286 --> 00:03:41.196
and when they left they had smiles.

00:03:41.196 --> 00:03:44.026
Our job is done, because we care."

00:03:44.026 --> 00:03:47.776
&gt;&gt;Katrina, see you
tomorrow, okay buddy?

00:03:48.046 --> 00:03:50.596
