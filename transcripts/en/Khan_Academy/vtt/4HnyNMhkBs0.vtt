00:00:00.288 --> 00:00:01.504
- [Voiceover] Let's see
if we can get a sense

00:00:01.504 --> 00:00:03.455
of different masses,
and we're gonna do that

00:00:03.455 --> 00:00:05.759
by doing the arithmetic
word problems with mass

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.464
on Kahn Academy.

00:00:07.464 --> 00:00:10.497
So it says which is the
closest to the mass of a cow?

00:00:10.497 --> 00:00:14.940
So it's either seven
kilograms or 700 kilograms.

00:00:15.816 --> 00:00:19.130
So let's think about what
seven kilograms would be.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.805
So one kilogram if you're
used to dealing with pounds,

00:00:22.805 --> 00:00:25.500
one kilogram is 2.2 pounds.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.531
So seven kilograms is
like 15 or 16 pounds.

00:00:29.531 --> 00:00:34.070
That would be the weight
of maybe a large cat,

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.283
or a several-month-old baby.

00:00:38.283 --> 00:00:40.717
That would be seven kilograms.

00:00:40.717 --> 00:00:44.939
So most cows are not the
size of just a large cat,

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:46.957
they are much bigger than that.

00:00:46.957 --> 00:00:50.719
700 kilograms, that actually
seems a little bit more right.

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.231
That's going to be closer to 1500 pounds.

00:00:55.231 --> 00:00:58.864
Cows are really, really big
animals, and they weigh a lot.

00:00:58.864 --> 00:01:01.303
So I would go with 700 kilograms,

00:01:01.303 --> 00:01:03.543
because seven kilograms
is just ridiculous.

00:01:03.543 --> 00:01:05.862
That's the size of a,

00:01:05.862 --> 00:01:08.919
as I said, a large cat.

00:01:08.919 --> 00:01:10.961
Let's keep going.

00:01:12.303 --> 00:01:15.597
All of Glinda's magic
wands have the same mass.

00:01:15.597 --> 00:01:18.653
Glinda knows the mass of one magic wand.

00:01:18.653 --> 00:01:21.597
What is the total mass
of seven magic wands?

00:01:21.597 --> 00:01:25.177
So it tells us the mass of
one magic wand is six grams.

00:01:25.177 --> 00:01:28.312
And just so you know,
six grams is not a lot.

00:01:28.312 --> 00:01:31.216
So you might, in the last exercise we saw,

00:01:31.216 --> 00:01:35.777
we were talking about seven
kilograms, or 700 kilograms.

00:01:35.777 --> 00:01:39.711
When you put a kilo in front
of gram, that means 1000 grams.

00:01:39.711 --> 00:01:43.709
So seven kilograms is 7,000 grams.

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:46.630
Here we're just taking
about straight-up grams.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.109
So grams are not much mass at all.

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:52.517
If you were to think
about a teaspoon of sugar,

00:01:52.517 --> 00:01:55.482
that's about four or five grams of sugar.

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:58.005
So this wand is very very light.

00:01:58.005 --> 00:01:59.496
But anyway, what they're asking us is

00:01:59.496 --> 00:02:02.054
what would be the mass
of seven magic wands?

00:02:02.054 --> 00:02:04.030
Well if each of them are six grams,

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.605
and we have seven of them,
seven times six is 42.

00:02:07.605 --> 00:02:11.405
So we're gonna have 42 grams.

00:02:11.405 --> 00:02:13.997
Let's keep going, this is fun.

00:02:13.997 --> 00:02:18.269
All crayons at Caryn's Crayon
Factory have the same mass.

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.161
Caryn weighs seven crayons and finds that

00:02:21.161 --> 00:02:23.370
they have the total mass of 56 grams.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.681
What is the mass of one of the crayons?

00:02:25.681 --> 00:02:28.769
So seven crayons have a mass of 56 grams.

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.376
So the mass of each of
them, let's just take 56

00:02:31.376 --> 00:02:34.561
and divide it by seven,
by the seven crayons.

00:02:34.561 --> 00:02:37.089
Well 56 divided by seven is eight.

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:39.249
Seven times eight is 56.

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:41.844
So the mass of each crayon is eight grams.

00:02:41.844 --> 00:02:43.096
And you could even check that.

00:02:43.096 --> 00:02:45.987
Seven crayons times
eight grams per crayon,

00:02:45.987 --> 00:02:49.253
is going to be 56 grams.

00:02:49.253 --> 00:02:51.767
This is surprisingly fun.

00:02:51.767 --> 00:02:54.703
Tina has five pencils.

00:02:54.703 --> 00:02:57.247
All of her pencils have the same mass.

00:02:57.247 --> 00:03:00.462
Tina finds the mass of
one pencil shown below.

00:03:00.462 --> 00:03:02.695
And it's eight grams.

00:03:02.695 --> 00:03:05.609
What is the total mass of five pencils?

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:08.183
Well if one pencil is eight grams,

00:03:08.183 --> 00:03:10.871
five pencils are gonna be
five times eight grams.

00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:12.810
Well five times eight is 40.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.614
It's going to be 40 grams.

00:03:17.844 --> 00:03:19.619
All right, this one seems similar.

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:24.562
All of Sophia's Squirrel's
acorns have the same mass.

00:03:24.562 --> 00:03:26.597
Sophia's squirrel finds the total mass

00:03:26.597 --> 00:03:28.701
of her four acorns shown below.

00:03:28.701 --> 00:03:30.962
What is the mass of one of the acorns?

00:03:30.962 --> 00:03:32.402
So here, actually this
is a little different

00:03:32.402 --> 00:03:34.202
than the last one, they find the mass

00:03:34.202 --> 00:03:37.394
of all four acorns are 20 grams.

00:03:37.394 --> 00:03:39.524
So what's the mass of each of them?

00:03:39.524 --> 00:03:42.028
Well, four times what is 20?

00:03:42.028 --> 00:03:44.585
Or 20 divided by four is what?

00:03:44.585 --> 00:03:47.682
20 divided by four is five.

00:03:47.682 --> 00:03:51.153
So five, 10, 15, 20.

00:03:51.153 --> 00:03:53.057
So if each of them are five grams,

00:03:53.057 --> 00:03:56.977
five grams times four is
gonna have a mass of 20 grams.
