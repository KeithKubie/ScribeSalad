00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.890
MALE SPEAKER: Welcome everybody
to one more "Talks at Google"

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:06.400
event.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.020
Today our guest is Sean Carroll.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.600
It is my distinct honor
to welcome him today.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.070
He is one of the greatest
humanist thinkers

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.730
of this generation.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.580
His new book is titled "The
Big Picture-- On the Origins

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.660
of Life, Meaning, and
the University Itself."

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.250
It's available in
your fine bookstores.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.180
Alan Lightman, author of
"The Accidental Universe"

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.900
and "Einstein's Dreams,"
said the following,

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.110
"Sean Caroll is a leading
theoretical cosmologist

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.750
with the added ability to
write about his subject

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.970
with unusual clarity,
flare, and wit."

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.630
Sean Caroll is a theoretical
physicist at Caltech.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.910
He received his
PhD from Harvard.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.500
He has worked on the foundations
of quantum mechanics,

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.050
the error of time, and the
emergence of complexity.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.160
He has appeared on "The
Colbert Report," PBS's

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.010
"NOVA" and "Through
the Wormhole,"

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.140
and has been interviewed by NPR,
"Scientific American," "Wired,"

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.190
"The New York
Times," and Google.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.954
Please welcome option Sean too.

00:01:05.954 --> 00:01:07.370
SEAN CARROLL: Thank
you very much.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.850
Let's see.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.475
So thanks very much
for having me here.

00:01:13.475 --> 00:01:14.830
It's good to be back at Google.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.630
And I appreciate
whenever people come out

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.234
for a talk on this completely
crazy title, "The Big Picture--

00:01:21.234 --> 00:01:23.650
On the Origins of Life, Meaning,
and the Universe Itself."

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.770
Usually a response I
get when people first

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.090
see the title is who
do you think you are?

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.460
How presumptuous must
you be to think that you

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.580
can talk about these things?

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.020
So I want to get the
disclaimer right on the board

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.610
right away, which is
that I do not know

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.084
what the origin of life is.

00:01:42.084 --> 00:01:44.125
I do not know what the
origin of the universe is.

00:01:44.125 --> 00:01:46.420
I do not know the
meaning of life.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.310
What I do think is
that we have a way

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.290
of talking about
these things now

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.250
that is sort of better
than we had before,

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.800
if before I means 500 years ago.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.460
And so this is not so
much a set of answers

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.090
to difficult questions
as it is encouragement

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.080
to continue the conversation
within a particular framework.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.200
And I'd like to start by telling
you the story of Lucia de Berk.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.250
She was a Dutch nurse.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.870
In 2004, she was convicted to
a sentence of life imprisonment

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.180
for murdering several
infants under her care.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.860
Now this is a sad story.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.340
But if you look into it,
there is an interesting thing

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.690
about the legal
proceedings, which

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.460
is there essentially wasn't
any evidence she had done it.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.660
And you might ask,
how is it possible

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.920
that someone gets convicted of
basically being a mass murder

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.120
without any direct evidence?

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.578
There were no
eyewitnesses that saw

00:02:36.578 --> 00:02:39.150
her do anything, no
poison in her handbag

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.560
or anything like that.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.270
And the answer is mathematics.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.870
The prosecution
asked statisticians

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.910
to estimate the likelihood
that this number of children

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.120
would die when a certain
nurse was on duty.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.080
And they said oh, it's
one in a million chance

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.090
or hundreds of
millions of chance.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.750
That was the primary reason
why she was convicted.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.230
Now later, other
mathematicians looked at it

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.540
and realize that it had
been bad mathematics.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.815
The argument was it was
more like a one in 25 or one

00:03:09.815 --> 00:03:12.240
in 100 chance that something
like that would happen,

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.720
which as I'm sure you all
know, those chances happen

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.910
all the time.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.570
In fact someone pointed
out that the total death

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.810
rate for children in
this hospital-- I mean,

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.880
it's a pediatric care hospital,
there's sick children there--

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.825
the death rate went down
after she was hired,

00:03:26.825 --> 00:03:28.200
which is not the
effect you would

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.580
expect as the hiring of a
serial killer to really have.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.160
But the other question is,
besides the bad mathematics,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.437
why were the people on
the jury so easily swayed,

00:03:40.437 --> 00:03:43.020
even though there was no direct
evidence that she had actually

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.020
done it?

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.840
And I'd like to point
to the possibility

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.170
that really it was part
of our very human desire

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.670
to blame something
when something happens.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.090
Rather than to think that
just things happen and there's

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.970
a little bit of irrationality
and randomness in the world,

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.010
we like to think there's a
reason why things happen.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.980
So when a whole bunch
of children die,

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.470
more than we might expect,
we want someone to blame.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.846
And once that starts,
we convince ourselves

00:04:10.846 --> 00:04:12.470
that we are on the
right track, finding

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.270
this reason for this happening.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.540
The picture on the left is
what Lucia de Berk actually

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.610
looks like.

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:20.140
The picture on the right
is the courtroom sketch

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.320
of what she looks like.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.100
Once you decide that this
person is the evil one who

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.230
was responsible for this,
then you look at her

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:29.670
in a slightly different way.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.970
Fortunately the
bad math went away.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.060
The good math took over
and she was released,

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.030
she was exonerated, and
found innocent later on.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.660
But the idea that we find
reasons why things happen

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.300
is not necessarily a bad one.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.810
It's an ancient one
and it goes back

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.820
to some of the greatest
thinkers in history.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.870
Aristotle very
famously had what he

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.677
called the four
causes for things

00:04:51.677 --> 00:04:53.260
happening, which we
might really think

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.220
of as four kinds of
explanation why things occur.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.080
And one of them was the
final cause for something.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.630
The final cause for Aristotle is
the reason for which something

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.730
exists, the goal for which it
is created in the first place.

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.770
The final cause of a seed is to
grow into a tree, for example.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.530
And this kind of reasoning,
this kind of metaphysical view

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.060
that the world at
its deepest levels

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.800
is a story of
causes and effects,

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.340
went through to these guys.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.900
This is Spinoza and
Leibniz, Baruch Spinoza

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.770
and Gottfried Leibniz.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.160
And they promulgated something
we call the principle

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.040
of sufficient reason.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.850
They also promulgated
a principle

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.940
that philosophers' hair gets
better and better over time,

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:37.890
as you see.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.040
I think Leibniz got
artificial help.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.820
But overall, there's
certainly a progress in nature

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.630
that we can observe here.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.070
The principal of
sufficient reason

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.460
is simply the statement
that everything

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.970
happens for a reason.

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.600
You can find this on bumper
stickers and greeting cards,

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.890
but Leibniz in
particular raised it

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.000
to the level of a
metaphysical principle.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.030
For everything that happens,
there is a cause or reason why.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.190
And again it's not crazy.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.260
In our everyday experience,
that is kind of what we see.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.140
Things do not just happen.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.370
The book is not going to
see just fly off into air.

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.580
There seems to be reasons
why things happen.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.680
If the book moves, it's
because I moved it.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.130
And for Aristotle and
for many other people,

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.590
this metaphysical claim
that things that happen

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.540
do so because something
causes them to happen,

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.150
influenced their
ideas about physics.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.380
So for Aristotle, if
things are moving,

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.750
it implies that
something is moving them.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.990
There is a reason why
things are moving.

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.690
And his reasoning is
quite straightforward.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.040
If I start pushing on
the book, it will move.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.390
And if I stop, it stops.

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:44.100
There you go.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.410
That's the basis for a way
of thinking about physics,

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:49.720
that if you see things
moving in the world,

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.000
you need to explain that.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.320
You need to find the reason
why, what the mover is.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.520
And this extends from
individual objects like books

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.120
to everything in the universe.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.810
The universe is full of motions.

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.540
But to Aristotle, the
natural state of being

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.090
was for things to
stay stationary.

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:10.160
So the existence of all these
motions and transformations

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.310
of all sorts
implies that there's

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:17.350
something behind the scenes
causing those kinds of motions.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:21.700
That is not how we think about
fundamental physics today.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.805
Over the course of improved
explanation and experimentation

00:07:24.805 --> 00:07:28.690
and theorizing, we have a
very, very different way

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:30.280
of thinking about
how the world works

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.250
at its most fundamental level.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:34.350
But it's not a way that
we make a big deal of.

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:37.760
There's many things that
popularization of science

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.757
will talk about
over and over again.

00:07:39.757 --> 00:07:41.590
You can't go faster
than the speed of light.

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:45.480
You can't know your position
and velocity at the same time.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.710
But we don't talk about the
fact that the whole principle

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:51.040
of cause and effect as
a fundamental organizing

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.910
principle for the universe
is no longer part of our best

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:56.284
theories of physics.

00:07:56.284 --> 00:07:57.450
Some people talked about it.

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:59.670
Bertrand Russell
liked to emphasize it.

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:02.337
He was primarily a philosopher,
but a mathematical philosopher

00:08:02.337 --> 00:08:03.420
who knew a lot of physics.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.300
And he said, "The law
of causality I believe,

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.510
like much that passes
muster among philosophers,

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:13.016
is a relic of a bygone age,
surviving, like the monarchy--"

00:08:13.016 --> 00:08:14.390
he just had to
get that in there.

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.880
He couldn't stick to just
the philosophy and science--

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.140
"only because it is erroneously
supposed to do no harm."

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:24.180
So this should be, I
hope, in your minds,

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.980
quite an extraordinary claim.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.440
The law of causality, that you
have a cause for every effect,

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.789
that the cause precedes
the effect, that's

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:35.340
not part of our understanding
of the world anymore.

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:37.419
What is going on?

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:40.008
Well it's not that
anything could happen.

00:08:40.008 --> 00:08:42.049
It's not that because
there's no cause and effect

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:44.049
at the deep level, the
book can in fact just fly

00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:45.690
all over the place.

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:48.360
The point is that we've
replaced the principal that

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.100
causes precede effects
with a principle

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.550
that the world is
governed by patterns.

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:55.740
And this happened slowly.

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:58.689
Here's one example, sort
of the tipping point,

00:08:58.689 --> 00:09:00.230
if you will, from
one way of thinking

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:02.600
about the world to another
one, was the principal we

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.860
call conservation of momentum.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.339
If any of you in the room
have taken physics classes,

00:09:08.339 --> 00:09:10.630
you have been tortured by
the principle of conservation

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:12.960
of momentum to sort of
find the solution when

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.790
different balls bump into
each other and so forth.

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:18.330
But in fact this
principle is part

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.060
of a whole new way
of thinking about how

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.000
reality works at a deep level.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.355
It took hundreds of years
and many, many smart people

00:09:24.355 --> 00:09:24.980
to think of it.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.610
One of the primary
people was Ibn Sina,

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:29.970
who was a Persian polymath.

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:31.970
To a modern physicist
like me, Ibn Sina

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:35.510
is extremely annoying, because
he wasn't even a physicist,

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:36.650
primarily.

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:37.450
He was a doctor.

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:38.450
He was a medical doctor.

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:40.449
He wrote a lot about the
human body and anatomy.

00:09:40.449 --> 00:09:42.670
He did physics in
his spare time,

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:44.570
and he invented
conservation of momentum.

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:46.945
This is very annoying to me.

00:09:46.945 --> 00:09:49.070
But he wouldn't have said
conservation of momentum.

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:51.730
Again, it took hundreds
of years to get it right.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:55.840
The basic idea that Ibn
Sina put his finger on

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.252
is that if you could
remove friction,

00:09:58.252 --> 00:10:01.680
if you could remove dissipation,
if you imagine something

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.810
moving through the vacuum,
it would keep moving forever.

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:08.374
This was the invention
of that other device

00:10:08.374 --> 00:10:10.540
that physics teachers like
to use to torture people,

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:12.510
the frictionless surface.

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:15.040
If you imagine something
moving in the complete absence

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.850
of friction, it
would not slow down

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:18.380
or require a cause
to keep moving,

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.570
it would just keep moving.

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:23.440
And this principle was improved
upon by people like Galileo who

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.950
did experiments, and
finally Christiaan Huygens

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:27.580
was the one who
actually formulated

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:32.080
our modern mathematical notion
of conservation of momentum.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.390
So why is conservation of
momentum such a big deal,

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:35.890
over and above
the fact that it's

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:37.900
a tool for physicists to use?

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.290
Because it implies that
there's a different way

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:43.380
that the world naturally is.

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:46.150
If you're Aristotle, the
natural way for things to be

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:49.380
is to kind of sit there
in their happy place,

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.540
and you need to do something
to get them moving.

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:54.680
In a world with
conservation of momentum,

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:58.590
the natural thing for the
world is to move and change,

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:01.780
and implies you don't need to
explain why things are moving.

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:03.922
Things just naturally move.

00:11:03.922 --> 00:11:06.130
And this was developed over
time and probably reached

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:10.375
the pinnacle with Pierre-Simon
Laplace, a French mathematician

00:11:10.375 --> 00:11:12.882
and physicist around
the year 1800.

00:11:12.882 --> 00:11:14.465
He did not invent
classical mechanics.

00:11:14.465 --> 00:11:17.080
It was Newton, as we all know,
who really put the finishing

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.720
touches on classical mechanics.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.960
But you can make the
argument that Laplace

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.090
was the first person to really
internalize what it meant,

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:27.540
the deep implications of this
Newtonian clockwork universe

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:28.816
worldview.

00:11:28.816 --> 00:11:30.690
So you know that if you
do a physics problem,

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:32.890
and again you ignore
friction and dissipation

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:35.510
and so forth, you play
physics billiards,

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:38.800
physicist billiards where
balls just bump into each other

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.920
and so forth, you can solve
the problem of these two balls

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.490
are moving with
certain velocities.

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:46.573
They scatter and they go
off in another direction.

00:11:46.573 --> 00:11:48.230
What is the direction
and the speed

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.500
at which the balls
are going to go?

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:52.970
Laplace was the
first to point out

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:54.975
that that process is reversible.

00:11:54.975 --> 00:11:56.900
That if you started
up here saying

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.040
that the balls are
moving apart, what

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.390
were they doing in the past?

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:04.430
And Newton's laws make an
absolutely clear prediction

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:06.450
for what they were
doing in this world

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:08.720
where you can ignore
friction and dissipation.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.310
If you made a movie
of this whole process

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:15.600
and played it backward, it
would look completely plausible.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.560
So Laplace invented what we
now call Laplace's demon,

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.000
or what he called
a vast intellect.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.550
Laplace's demon
is something that

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.895
has the ability-- what
we'd now really call

00:12:25.895 --> 00:12:27.640
it is a really good computer.

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.720
Maybe you have a Laplace's demon
in one of the other buildings.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.180
If Laplace's demon
knew everything

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:36.560
about the state of the
universe at one moment in time,

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.490
the position and the momentum
of every particle moving

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:42.000
in the universe,
then Laplace says

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.350
that vast intellect would
know the future and past just

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:46.905
as surely as the present.

00:12:46.905 --> 00:12:49.180
If that vast intellect knew
all the laws of physics

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:51.320
and was able to calculate
what would happen,

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.695
there would be
nothing that would

00:12:52.695 --> 00:12:55.230
be uncertain to that
intellect about what

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:58.500
would happen in the future,
what had happened in the past.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:01.490
So this is, even though
it's a subtle difference,

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:04.460
a crucially different way
of thinking about the world.

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:08.700
It's not that this configuration
of stuff causes this one

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.350
and therefore causes that.

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:13.110
All of them are
related by a pattern

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:14.710
called the laws of physics.

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:19.560
Just like the integers 0, 1, 2,
3, minus 1, minus 2, minus 3,

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.670
the number two happens
after the number one

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:24.570
and before the
number three, but we

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:27.610
don't say that the number one
is the cause of number two,

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:29.580
or two is the cause of three.

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:32.110
We just say that every
number is one bigger or less

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:33.640
than the numbers next to it.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.960
It's just a pattern
that follows,

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.650
and you can go forward
or backward equally well.

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:40.460
And Laplace says that
is what the world is

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:43.280
like at a deep level.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.870
Now these things we know better
than Newtonian mechanics.

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:48.140
We've had quantum mechanics,
statistical mechanics,

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:50.020
general relativity,
and so forth.

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:53.500
But the basic Laplacian
principle remains the same.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.830
It's just the actual laws
that we have are different.

00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:59.020
So one of the claims
that I make in the book

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.950
that I would like to defend
is that this audacious

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:04.410
sounding idea, that
the laws of physics

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:07.760
underlying everyday life
are completely known.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.740
Now when I say this,
people like to stop

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:11.900
listening when I say
underlying everyday life, so I

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:13.430
want to emphasize that.

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:16.220
I'm not saying the laws of
physics are completely known.

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:17.890
I'm not also saying
that everyday life

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:18.800
is completely known.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.633
There's plenty of things
about everyday life

00:14:20.633 --> 00:14:23.190
that I don't know about,
plenty of things about physics

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:25.210
we don't know about--
dark matter, dark energy,

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:28.700
black holes, the Big Bang,
plenty of physics that is not

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.880
about the underlying
laws that we don't know--

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.960
high temperature,
superconductivity,

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.070
turbulence, and so forth.

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:38.344
I'm making quite a specific
claim, that you and I

00:14:38.344 --> 00:14:40.010
and all this stuff
right in front of us,

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:43.660
literally the stuff we can touch
and see in our everyday lives,

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:47.110
these are made of things--
atoms, electrons, protons,

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:48.310
neutrons.

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:50.670
Those protons and neutrons
are made of quarks.

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:52.930
And all these particles
interact in a certain way.

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:56.360
And we know both what
those particles are

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.410
and how they interact.

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:01.120
When I say we know, not
only do we have a good idea,

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.560
but a thousand years from now
or a million years from now

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.960
this idea will still be right.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.800
Hopefully we will learn
more-- I mean, maybe

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.959
the quarks and
electrons and so forth

00:15:09.959 --> 00:15:11.250
are made of even tinier things.

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:12.620
That's great.

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.650
But there won't stop being
quarks and electrons,

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:17.990
and we won't be wrong
about how they interact.

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:22.240
And there are deep reasons
for believing this is true.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.280
Let me just tell you
what the ingredients are.

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.700
This is an atom, right?

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:28.280
This a neutron and a
proton, an electron,

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.150
so it's a deuterium
isotope of hydrogen.

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:33.600
The electron is held
together to the nucleus

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.330
by electromagnetism.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:36.845
The individual
protons and neutrons

00:15:36.845 --> 00:15:39.470
are made of quarks, up and down
quarks, which are held together

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:41.490
with the strong nuclear force.

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:43.690
Occasionally an up
quark or a down quark

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:46.820
can convert into the other
one by the weak nuclear force

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:50.090
and give up a neutrino
in the process.

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:53.220
Everything is pulled towards
everything else by gravity.

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:56.840
And everything's swims in the
background of the Higgs field.

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.570
The Higgs boson
particle is something

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:01.985
we discovered just in 2012,
the Large Hadron Collider.

00:16:01.985 --> 00:16:03.360
The particle is
what happens when

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.100
you start this field
vibrating, but the field

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:09.530
itself, the Higgs field
pervades all of space,

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:11.530
affects the properties
of the other particles

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:13.002
that we're made up.

00:16:13.002 --> 00:16:14.460
There are more
particles than this.

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:16.900
These matter particles,
the electron, the quarks,

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:19.557
neutrinos, they all
have heavier cousins.

00:16:19.557 --> 00:16:21.140
But they decay away
very, very quickly

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:22.140
if you try to make them.

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:24.150
They do not affect
our everyday lives.

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:24.750
We know them.

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.500
We can complete
them in the theory.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.500
But you don't actually
need to know them to know

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.640
what you and I are made out of.

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:35.050
So that's it, as far as our
everyday world is concerned.

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:39.070
The point is that there's no
new particle, no new field,

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:43.430
no new force that we
will ever discover

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:47.460
that will have an impact on
our literal every day biology

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:50.060
or environment, like
what holds this table up.

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:52.220
We hope to discover
a lot more physics.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.630
It will not affect you or
what you're made out of.

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:58.160
So I know this is
a-- I keep being

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.360
told this is a technically
inclined audience.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.610
So you don't like the picture.

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:03.080
The picture makes you nervous.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.270
You want an equation.

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:07.210
So here it is.

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:09.250
This is what Nobel
laureate Frank Wilczek

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:11.160
has called the Core Theory.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.690
And he invented the name to
emphasize that we usually

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:17.380
distinguish between the standard
model of particle physics

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:19.943
and general relativity,
our best theory of gravity.

00:17:19.943 --> 00:17:22.359
And the reason we do that is
because general relativity is

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:24.829
a classical theory,
not a quantum theory.

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:27.250
We don't have a full
and complete theory

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:29.030
of quantum gravity yet.

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:31.610
What gets lost in
that true statement

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:33.530
is that we have a
pretty good every day

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:35.620
theory of quantum gravity.

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:38.815
We know quantum gravity in the
regime where fields are weak.

00:17:38.815 --> 00:17:41.230
We know quantum
gravity perfectly well

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:43.650
if you want to use it to
calculate the Moon orbiting

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:45.890
around the Earth, for example.

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:47.640
So if you're literally
only interested

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:52.850
in the regime of everyday life,
this is it, including gravity.

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:56.600
This is basically the Feynman
path integral, the probability

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.987
to go from one amplitude in a
field theory to another one.

00:17:59.987 --> 00:18:01.820
I'm not going to go
through all the details,

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:04.610
but basically you see how
all of the different pieces

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:06.640
of modern physics get involved.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:09.100
There's quantum mechanics,
space time, gravity,

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:12.020
this is Einstein's general
relativity right there,

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:13.900
all the other forces,
electromagnetism

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:16.300
and the nuclear forces,
the matter particles

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:19.644
of which we are made, and
the Higgs in the background.

00:18:19.644 --> 00:18:21.310
If you want know more
about the details,

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:24.440
I did manage to squeeze
it into the book.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.120
But I was told it should
be put into an appendix,

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:30.130
and the font size is very
small in the appendix.

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:34.430
But nevertheless, every term
here is explained, briefly.

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:36.430
It takes a year long
quantum field theory course

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:38.013
in graduate school
to get the details,

00:18:38.013 --> 00:18:39.680
but at least say what
every term means,

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:42.210
including the i for
example and including

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:43.950
the k less than lambda.

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:48.920
What you don't see are causes,
purposes, or reasons why.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:52.230
It's just Laplacian calculation
over and over again.

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:54.170
This is the modern
version of what

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:56.770
you need to program
into Laplace's demon

00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:59.050
so that starting from the
position and configuration

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:01.508
of the world at one point, it
can find out what will happen

00:19:01.508 --> 00:19:04.180
next or what happened before.

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:06.410
The final criterion
you need for this

00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:08.230
to be a good, successful
theory is that it

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:09.380
should fit on a T-shirt.

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:10.610
So we did the experiment.

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:11.640
There it is.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.330
It totally fits on the T-shirt.

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:15.655
You can buy them on my website.

00:19:15.655 --> 00:19:19.290
I don't make any money off them,
but you can buy the T-shirt.

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:23.580
So I want to do at least
one minute of justification

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:24.890
for this grandiose claim.

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:25.860
I mean, it's one thing
to have a theory.

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:27.167
We have lots of theories.

00:19:27.167 --> 00:19:28.500
Our theories are never complete.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.760
Our theories are never things
we should have 100% credence in.

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:33.490
We should always,
as scientists, be

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:35.240
willing to improve
upon our theories.

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.266
So what gives me the
right to say that

00:19:37.266 --> 00:19:38.890
a million years from
now, this is still

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:40.990
going to be the
theory underlying

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:43.690
the particles and forces of
which you and I are made.

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:45.350
The answer is something
called crossing

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:48.550
symmetry, which is a feature
of quantum field theory.

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:50.100
I mention fields.

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.190
Fields are in fact what
you and I are made out of.

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:54.398
You might have taken a
physics course and been asked,

00:19:54.398 --> 00:19:57.290
is light a particle or a wave,
or is an electron a particle

00:19:57.290 --> 00:19:58.690
or a wave?

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:00.440
Probably you were
not told the answer.

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.410
It's a wave.

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:02.910
That's what it is.

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:05.690
According to quantum mechanics,
the world is made of waves.

00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:09.170
The world looks like particles
when we look closely enough.

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:11.140
But really the way that
we talk about the world

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:13.735
in modern physics is through
quantum field theory.

00:20:13.735 --> 00:20:15.860
And quantum field theory
uses these little pictures

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:17.340
called Feynman diagrams.

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:20.730
My personal claim to fame
in the world of physics

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:23.280
is that the desk I have
in my office at Caltech

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.470
used to be owned
by Richard Feynman.

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:26.914
So I sit at Feynman's old desk.

00:20:26.914 --> 00:20:29.580
I leave blank pieces of paper in
there hoping some diagrams will

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:31.740
appear, but it never happens.

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.430
So what Feynman did is to
invent a way of talking about

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:37.300
what happens in particle physics
and quantum field theory,

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:40.020
and also how likely
it is to happen.

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:43.210
So if we have a particle we
know about, like a proton,

00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:44.885
and we imagine there's
a new particle.

00:20:44.885 --> 00:20:46.260
Maybe there's a
new particle that

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:49.980
really does affect how
you choose your food

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:53.750
or how plants photosynthesize
or how you think,

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:55.790
well then there must be
a Feynman diagram that

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:57.620
says that that
particle can interact

00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:00.590
with a proton via
some new interaction.

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:03.670
And Feynman's rules say how
you can use this diagram

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:06.800
to calculate how likely
that is to happen,

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.970
the amplitude or the
probability of that process.

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:11.510
And then crossing
symmetry says--

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:14.510
this is a diagram that time
evolves from left to right.

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:16.010
So X comes in, P comes in.

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:17.970
They just scatter
off of each other.

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:20.850
Crossing symmetry says that
if this diagram exists,

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:23.510
I can rotate it
clockwise by 90 degrees

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:25.912
and get another
diagram that exists.

00:21:25.912 --> 00:21:28.120
So I'm glossing over the
difference between particles

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.250
and antiparticles here.

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:31.980
Really if this is a proton,
this is still a proton.

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:35.380
This diagram talks about a
proton and an antiproton coming

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:38.450
together to produce
an X particle

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:40.890
and an anti-X particle.

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:42.530
And what crossing
symmetry says is

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:44.530
if you know how big
this diagram is,

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:46.402
if you know how likely
that process is,

00:21:46.402 --> 00:21:49.950
you know how likely
this process is.

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:52.910
So if this new X particle
interacts with protons

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:55.360
or with neutrons or
quarks or neutrinos

00:21:55.360 --> 00:22:00.190
or whatever, strongly enough
to affect your everyday life,

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:03.820
then we could make it by
smashing together the particles

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:05.600
out of which we are created.

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.400
And the punchline
is we have looked.

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.670
We have smashed together
all the particles.

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:11.640
We've smashed together
protons and protons.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.325
That's what the LHC is doing.

00:22:13.325 --> 00:22:15.840
We've done protons and
antiprotons, electrons

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:19.090
and electrons, electrons and
positrons on down the line.

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:21.600
We would have loved to find
a new particle like this,

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:22.990
and we have not done so yet.

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:25.100
There are no
particles like this.

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:27.210
The closest we have
is a tiny little bit

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:29.750
of a hint at the
Large Hadron Collider,

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:32.830
as of May, 2016,
that there might

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:35.877
be a new particle that is 800
times the mass of the proton.

00:22:35.877 --> 00:22:36.960
It may or may not be true.

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.060
There's a little bump.

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:38.850
Maybe it's there.

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:40.120
We're still looking.

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:42.340
But even if it is, it
decays away in less than a

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:42.950
zeptosecond.

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:46.770
It is not something that affects
your everyday life in any way.

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:49.680
So in terms of the particles
that actually matter to you

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:54.890
and me that make us up, we
know the complete collection.

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:57.360
So the question is, the
big question ahead of us

00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:01.690
today is, if that's true,
why does the manifest world

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:05.190
of our everyday experience
seem so different

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:08.190
than the underlying laws of
quantum mechanics and quantum

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:10.190
field theory and
particle physics?

00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:13.470
And the answer is this
tricky idea called emergence.

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:15.690
You can have an
underlying layer of

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:18.740
microscopic fundamental physics
made of particles, forces,

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:20.450
and differential Equations.

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:22.090
It can do what Laplace said.

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:25.960
Information is conserved from
moment to moment over time.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.240
The rules of physics are
patterns written down

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.160
in differential equations.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.700
And yet, when you
collect together

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:37.030
many of these particles, there
can be collective behavior

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:39.860
that is implicit but
not at all obvious,

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:41.700
in this microscopic rules.

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:45.620
This collective behavior could
emerge into wholly new concepts

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:47.650
and vocabularies.

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:49.980
So the idea that there are
tables and chairs and people

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:52.950
and planets, that's
nowhere obvious

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:54.680
in this underlying description.

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:58.570
But the two levels can be
compatible with each other.

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:01.530
This is the world of cause
and effect, reasons why,

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:04.920
dissipation, and most
importantly the arrow of time,

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.470
the difference between
past and future.

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:11.290
So our task today is to see
how this one level can be

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:13.110
compatible with the other one.

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:17.640
Why can we think that there are
reasons why causes and effects,

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.180
and for that matter
right and wrong

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:21.240
and truth and
beauty in the world,

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.740
even though at some
level, deep down, it's

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:25.790
just stuff happening
according to that equation

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:27.750
that I showed you.

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:30.730
So the arrow of time, one
of my favorite topics,

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:33.910
is simply the fact that
the past and future

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:35.840
are different from each other.

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:38.930
This is not a surprising
fact if you're Aristotle.

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:41.250
Motion through time, the
evolution of the universe

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:42.849
is obviously something profound.

00:24:42.849 --> 00:24:44.390
The past is different
from the future

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:46.680
because the past
already happened.

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:49.730
But according to Laplace
or to modern physics,

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:52.470
there's no difference between
moving toward the past

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:55.030
and moving toward the future
at the microscopic level.

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:57.220
Only macroscopically
is there a difference,

00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:59.130
and there are many differences.

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:02.380
You can remember the past, but
you can't remember the future.

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:04.870
We were all younger in
the past and will be older

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:05.760
in the future.

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.380
Sorry to break that to you.

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:10.570
Most importantly or
most fundamentally,

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:12.900
entropy increases over time.

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:14.650
Entropy is the way
that we have of talking

00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:17.440
about the disorderliness,
the randomness,

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:20.510
the disorganization
of stuff over time.

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:22.900
And there's a general
principle that organized things

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:26.580
like unbroken eggs can easily
evolve into disorganized things

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:29.660
like broken eggs, but never
backward the other way,

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.790
or at least very, very
rarely, or at least

00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:34.040
you need to do a lot of
work to make it happen.

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:38.380
If you live in a room or you
have an office and it's clean,

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:41.780
it will naturally happen that
it becomes messy over time.

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:44.370
If your office or room
is messy, it will never

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:46.710
clean itself up all by itself.

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:48.480
You need to do work.

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.497
That's because
entropy is increasing.

00:25:50.497 --> 00:25:53.080
If you'd like to think of it as
the working out of a great law

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:55.640
of physics, be my guest.

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:57.320
And the reason why
this is true is

00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:59.960
because there are more
ways to be high entropy

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:00.960
than to be low entropy.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.570
There are more
arrangements of stuff

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:04.730
that are messy
than are organized.

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:07.190
This was the brilliant
insight of Ludwig Boltzmann,

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:09.500
the 19th century physicist.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:14.830
And so therefore if you start in
a configuration of low entropy,

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:17.830
entropy naturally increases.

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:21.260
The problem was,
therefore, why isn't

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:23.520
entropy at its maximum value?

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.270
There are many, many
more ways for entropy

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:27.340
to be high than for
entropy to be low.

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:30.510
Why is it true that
entropy was ever low?

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:32.770
So Boltzmann, in
other words, explains

00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:34.730
why, given the entropy
of the universe today,

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:35.937
it will be higher tomorrow.

00:26:35.937 --> 00:26:38.520
There are more ways to be high
entropy than to be low entropy.

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:42.280
But he does not explain
why it was lower yesterday.

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:44.057
I'm here to tell you the answer.

00:26:44.057 --> 00:26:45.640
The reason the entropy
of the universe

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.840
was lower yesterday than today
is because it was even lower

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:51.890
the day before yesterday.

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:53.425
And the reason why
that's true too

00:26:53.425 --> 00:26:56.330
is because it was even
lower the day before that.

00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:59.710
And this reasoning goes
back 13.7 billion years

00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:01.240
to the Big Bang.

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:04.505
The reason why the universe
has had a low entropy all along

00:27:04.505 --> 00:27:06.780
is because it started that way.

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:08.000
Nobody knows why.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.520
This is a profound question
for modern cosmology.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:14.660
But once you give me that, I
can explain all the differences

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:16.290
between the past and the future.

00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:18.660
So one way of thinking
about it is, we all agree

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:21.450
that there's no arrow of space.

00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:23.190
If you're out there
in a space suit,

00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:24.680
there would be no difference
between up and down,

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:26.120
left, right, forward, backward.

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:27.574
But here in this room there is.

00:27:27.574 --> 00:27:29.990
If I drop the laser pointer,
I know it's going to go down.

00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:32.500
There's an arrow of
space pointing down.

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:37.050
Nobody thinks that this is
some profound consequence

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:38.980
of the fundamental
laws of physics.

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:42.030
It's because we live in the
vicinity of a very influential

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:44.750
object, namely the Earth.

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:47.940
The point of this discussion
is that time is like that.

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:51.230
There is no intrinsic arrow of
time in the laws of physics,

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:53.710
but we think that there is
in our observable universe

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:57.180
because we live in the aftermath
of a very influential event,

00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:58.539
the Big Bang.

00:27:58.539 --> 00:28:00.580
I'm not going to explain
why the Big Bang was low

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:01.900
entropy, because nobody knows.

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:03.720
Don't believe anyone who
comes in here and tells you

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:04.220
they know.

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:06.730
It's a good topic
for conversation.

00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:10.590
But given that, we can try
to explain other features

00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:11.770
of the arrow of time.

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:15.600
For existence, the existence
of memories and causes, right?

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:18.400
Memories are something
where we know something now.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.830
It implies something
about the past.

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:22.830
The cause is something
that we do something now,

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:25.140
it implies something will
happen in the future.

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:27.590
Where does this
asymmetry come from?

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:28.650
So here's a memory.

00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:30.770
Here's a picture of
a record of an event.

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:32.430
This is an egg that was broken.

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:33.888
You're walking down
the street, you

00:28:33.888 --> 00:28:35.950
see a broken egg
on the sidewalk.

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:38.600
Ask yourself, what does the
future hold for this egg?

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.475
I don't know why you're
asking yourself this.

00:28:40.475 --> 00:28:41.720
You're in a reflective mood.

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.396
What is the future of this
poor egg going to hold?

00:28:44.396 --> 00:28:45.020
You don't know.

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:46.420
I mean, there's many
different possibilities.

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:48.080
It could just sit
there for a long time.

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:49.496
It could wash away
in a rainstorm.

00:28:49.496 --> 00:28:52.010
Someone could clean it up.

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:55.290
But if you ask yourself what
does the past of the egg

00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:59.010
probably experience, what
are things like for the egg

00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:01.610
recently, with
overwhelming probability

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:05.830
that egg used to be unbroken,
and someone dropped it.

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:08.670
Why is it that this
single record-- this

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:09.960
isn't even moving, right?

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.900
The macroscopic information
is not changing in time.

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:15.340
The egg is just sitting
there stationary.

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:18.270
Why are you able to draw
such different conclusions

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:20.464
about its past than its future?

00:29:20.464 --> 00:29:21.880
The answer is
because secretly you

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:24.280
know that the Big Bang
had a low entropy.

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:27.410
You don't use that in your
everyday life, but that's why.

00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:30.590
If all you knew is physics and
the macroscopic information

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:32.049
about the egg, the
number of things

00:29:32.049 --> 00:29:33.589
that could happen
in the future would

00:29:33.589 --> 00:29:35.310
be exactly equal to
the number of things

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:36.790
that happened in the past.

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:39.260
But the extra thing you
know is that the universe

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:40.400
started with low entropy.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:43.480
That ties the possible
histories in the past.

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:46.170
And what that means is
that you know something

00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:49.670
about the past
condition of the egg.

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:51.289
Unbroken eggs lead
to broken eggs,

00:29:51.289 --> 00:29:52.830
because that's the
easiest way to get

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:56.510
to broken eggs given the low
entropy past of the universe.

00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:58.930
And causes and effects
work the same way.

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:00.597
Just like an egg is
something-- a memory

00:30:00.597 --> 00:30:02.930
is something that if it were
a little bit different now,

00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:05.060
it would imply something
different about the past.

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:06.310
Think about what a cause does.

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:10.039
If I say I move my hand
and the book moves,

00:30:10.039 --> 00:30:11.830
if I move my hand a
little bit differently,

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:15.390
like I missed the book, then
it wouldn't have moved, right?

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:21.600
So if my hand moving is the
cause of the book moving,

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:24.230
that's because if my hand had
done something very different,

00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:26.396
it would have implied
something different about what

00:30:26.396 --> 00:30:27.125
comes next.

00:30:27.125 --> 00:30:29.337
If I'm waving my
hand over here, I

00:30:29.337 --> 00:30:30.920
could wave in a
slightly different way

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.770
and it doesn't imply anything
different about the book.

00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:35.480
And therefore this hand moving
is not the cause of the book.

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.521
It's the thing that came
right next to it that is

00:30:37.521 --> 00:30:39.040
the cause of the book moving.

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:41.000
The idea that causes
proceed effects

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.540
emerges in our macroscopic world
because of the arrow of time.

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:49.270
So that is the first
little baby step

00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:51.710
towards reconciling
our everyday world

00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:55.250
with this impersonal,
calculational underlying

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:56.530
laws of physics.

00:30:56.530 --> 00:30:59.010
The next step is if
the universe is just

00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:01.330
a story of stuff
becoming more and more

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:06.390
disorderly and entropic
over time, why are we here?

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:10.899
Why is anything complex and
intricate and organized exist

00:31:10.899 --> 00:31:11.565
in the universe?

00:31:11.565 --> 00:31:13.240
This is another good
question to which

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:15.776
we don't know the
complete answer,

00:31:15.776 --> 00:31:17.150
but it's interesting
that there's

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:19.990
a big part of the answer
which is that simplicity

00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:23.450
versus complexity is a whole
different axis on which

00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:25.590
to think about the
world than low entropy

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:27.559
versus high entropy.

00:31:27.559 --> 00:31:30.100
If you think about the classic
example of entropy increasing,

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:32.694
mixing cream
together with coffee.

00:31:32.694 --> 00:31:35.110
You know that in this picture,
this picture, this picture,

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:36.280
time moves left to right.

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:37.420
It's easy to mix things.

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:38.440
It's hard to unmix them.

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:39.340
This is low entropy.

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:41.630
That's high entropy.

00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:43.800
But this low entropy
configuration

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:47.430
with the cream on top, coffee on
the bottom is also very simple.

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:50.370
Cream's on the top,
coffee's on the bottom.

00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:52.300
Towards computer
thinking people,

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:55.120
it's algorithmically
compressible.

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:57.730
A small file sizes
necessary to tell you

00:31:57.730 --> 00:32:00.350
what happens microscopically
in that picture.

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:02.470
But the same thing
is true over here.

00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:03.960
It's high entropy.

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.731
It's all mixed up,
but still simple.

00:32:05.731 --> 00:32:06.480
It's all mixed up.

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:07.646
That's all you need to know.

00:32:07.646 --> 00:32:10.540
The file size is
also small here.

00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:13.880
It's in the middle where the
cream and coffee are beginning

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:16.760
to get mixed together, where
the tendrils of cream and coffee

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:20.910
are reaching into each other
and a fractal pattern develops,

00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:22.460
that's where it's complex.

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:25.930
This file size to show
you that picture is bigger

00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:28.320
than the one on the left,
the one on the right.

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:32.870
So while entropy in the universe
just increases monotonically,

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:37.200
complexity first increases
and then goes away.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.809
When entropy is
very, very small,

00:32:38.809 --> 00:32:40.850
it's impossible to be
complex because there's not

00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:43.480
that many possible
arrangements you can be.

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:44.990
But when entropy
is very, very large

00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:47.031
it's impossible to be
complex, because everything

00:32:47.031 --> 00:32:48.750
is smooth and homogeneous.

00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:52.920
It's only in between that
complexity is possible.

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:56.960
And therefore it's not only
compatible with the increase

00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:01.140
of entropy to see complex
forms arise in the universe.

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:03.310
It's because entropy
is increasing

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:05.320
that it can possibly happen.

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:08.212
And this behavior, complexity
going up and going down,

00:33:08.212 --> 00:33:09.420
is not just cream and coffee.

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:11.480
The universe is the same way.

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.590
The universe started
very simple and low

00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:18.600
entropy, hot dense expanding
universe near the Big Bang.

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:22.786
It will end very simple
and high entropy.

00:33:22.786 --> 00:33:24.410
Eventually all the
stars will burn out.

00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:25.826
All the black holes
will evaporate

00:33:25.826 --> 00:33:27.800
and we'll have nothing
but empty space.

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.620
We'll once again be very,
very simple but high entropy.

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:34.410
The last black hole will
evaporate 10 to the 100 years

00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:35.920
from now.

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:38.520
Yes, that's right, one
google years from now.

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:41.970
Before you guys stole the word
from us, this was a google.

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:47.310
The entropy of the universe
increases monotonically

00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:50.110
through its history, but the
complexity comes and goes.

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:53.080
The universe became
more and more complex

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.170
up to the present
day, and will start

00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:57.740
becoming less and less complex
as those stars stop shining.

00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:01.100
The stars stop shining
about 1 quadrillion years

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:02.380
after the Big Bang.

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:06.020
So it's today when gravity
has pulled things together,

00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:08.889
made the universal lumpy,
brought into existence planets

00:34:08.889 --> 00:34:12.810
and stars and galaxies,
biospheres and people

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:15.850
that the universe is
interesting and complex.

00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:18.469
As small as we are compared
to the vastness of the cosmos,

00:34:18.469 --> 00:34:22.100
we live in the interesting part
of the history of the universe

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:24.170
for exactly that reason.

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:25.840
And this kind of
reasoning can help

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:30.330
us explain even questions
like why life itself exists.

00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:34.050
So I like to tell the story,
I was once on a plane flight

00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:36.340
going to a conference
to give a talk.

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:40.800
And as often happens, if you're
a physicist or a cosmologist,

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.770
people find that
out and they want

00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:44.790
to tell you their theories.

00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:47.199
Everyone it seems has a
theory about the universe.

00:34:47.199 --> 00:34:50.389
I was reading some papers
about statistical mechanics

00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:52.110
and the origin of life.

00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:53.860
The guy sitting next
to me on the airplane

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:55.974
says, oh yes, I've
read those papers.

00:34:55.974 --> 00:34:59.570
So I'm a little bit skeptical.

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:02.640
But he says in fact I can
tell you the purpose of life.

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:04.560
And I'm very skeptical.

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:07.250
But he says the purpose of
life is to hydrogenation

00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:08.695
carbon dioxide.

00:35:08.695 --> 00:35:12.740
This is not the response
I was expecting to get.

00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:15.760
It turns out that I was seated
next to Dr Michael Russell, one

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.740
of the world's experts
in abiogenesis,

00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:18.870
the origin of life.

00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:23.950
He works at JPL, just down
the street from Caltech.

00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:25.865
And he writes papers
with graphs like this.

00:35:25.865 --> 00:35:29.950
And he was very serious about
the hydrogenation business.

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:32.610
What he means-- and again, we
don't know whether this is true

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:33.110
or not.

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:34.200
We don't know how life begins.

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:36.241
This is one of the theories
people are advancing.

00:35:36.241 --> 00:35:38.560
But you can see in
all these theories,

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:40.860
you can sort of see
the hints of how

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:42.780
a really, really
difficult problem suddenly

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:45.141
seems to be a lot more soluble.

00:35:45.141 --> 00:35:46.890
So what Russell's
pointing out, that there

00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:48.950
are many environments
in the early Earth

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:52.880
where there's a lot of carbon
dioxide and a lot of hydrogen.

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:55.500
And that is a low
entropy configuration.

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:57.620
And that's what we
call high free energy.

00:35:57.620 --> 00:36:01.620
So this is free energy versus
different compound structures.

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:04.340
If you took that carbon,
removed the oxygen,

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:07.390
and palled them all up with
a bunch of hydrogen atoms,

00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:08.900
the carbon would
now be in methane,

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:11.480
and the entropy
would be much higher.

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:13.900
In some sense,
the carbon dioxide

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:15.660
wants to become methane.

00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:18.810
The problem is that
there's a barrier,

00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:21.930
that all the ways to
get from CO2 to CH4

00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:26.010
involve going through even
lower entropy configurations--

00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:28.430
higher free energy
configurations.

00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:30.290
And that can't
happen all by itself.

00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:32.507
It's not like lighting
a match on a candle.

00:36:32.507 --> 00:36:34.090
But what Russell
points out is that it

00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:38.320
can happen if there's a
complicated network of chemical

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:41.190
reactions brought together
in just the right way

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:43.800
with the right
catalysts and so forth.

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:46.270
And that kind of network
in the right conditions

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:50.760
could be the precursor of the
metabolism of modern life.

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:54.110
So in the 1980s on the basis
of this kind of reasoning,

00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:57.100
Russell predicted the
existence of a certain kind

00:36:57.100 --> 00:37:00.440
of underwater geological
formation, what

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:04.430
we call warm alkaline
hydrothermal vents.

00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:07.040
And after he made the
prediction, they found one.

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:12.970
This is the lost city
configuration, lost city--

00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:13.970
I don't know what it is.

00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:19.350
It's a bunch of stuff happening
under the mid-Atlantic Ocean.

00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:20.890
And it has exactly
the properties

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:24.229
that you would need to get
this kind of reaction starting.

00:37:24.229 --> 00:37:26.270
There might be many of
them underneath the ocean.

00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:28.144
This is something that
we think will probably

00:37:28.144 --> 00:37:31.280
last there for tens of thousands
of years before it washes away.

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:33.300
And you make new ones.

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:36.520
So we don't know how life began.

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:37.980
But this way of
thinking about it

00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:41.510
is interesting because rather
than looking at it as life

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:45.080
exists, how did it possibly
start, this point of view

00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:47.440
is saying we have a
puzzle, how to increase

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:49.180
the entropy of the
early Earth, and life

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:51.249
is the solution to that puzzle.

00:37:51.249 --> 00:37:52.790
Of course you need
to get it together

00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:56.180
with other things like cell
walls and replication and RNA

00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:56.947
and so forth.

00:37:56.947 --> 00:37:58.530
Putting all those
pieces of the puzzle

00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:01.750
together is full employment
for abiogenesis researchers

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:04.410
for the next hundred
years probably.

00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:07.210
But then once that gets
started, once you have life,

00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:08.510
then things get interesting.

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:10.770
What is life anyway?

00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:12.600
Nobody knows that either.

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.940
I like the definition given
by the physicist Erwin

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:15.766
Schrodinger.

00:38:15.766 --> 00:38:17.390
Schrodinger said that
life is something

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:20.950
that keeps moving long
after it should've stopped.

00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:22.455
What does he mean by that?

00:38:22.455 --> 00:38:25.512
He means if you put a dead
thing in a bowl of water,

00:38:25.512 --> 00:38:26.470
it will just sit there.

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:27.345
It won't do anything.

00:38:27.345 --> 00:38:30.647
If you put a living thing like
a goldfish, in my experience

00:38:30.647 --> 00:38:32.480
it will also just die
and then it will float

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:35.050
to the bottom of the thing.

00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:37.810
But if you give it
food, the living thing

00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:39.280
can last for a long time.

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:40.600
What is food?

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:44.300
Food is energy in
a low entropy form.

00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:46.917
That's exactly what
we get from the sun.

00:38:46.917 --> 00:38:48.500
The sun gives us
energy, and you might

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:49.750
think that's what's important.

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:51.180
The sun gives us energy.

00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:53.570
But if the whole sky were
the temperature of the sun,

00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:55.319
none of us would be
here talking about it.

00:38:55.319 --> 00:38:57.360
You would come to
thermal equilibrium.

00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:00.800
What the sun gives us
is low entropy energy.

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:03.630
For every one photon of
light we get from the sun,

00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:06.970
we give back 20 photons
back to the universe.

00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:08.120
But we get visible light.

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:10.200
We radiate infrared.

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:14.190
We radiate photons with
1/20 of the energy each.

00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:16.830
So we get back the same
energy we get, but only

00:39:16.830 --> 00:39:20.430
after increasing its
entropy by a factor of 20,

00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:22.650
by photosynthesizing,
chewing our cud,

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:24.947
having meetings, writing
software, et cetera.

00:39:24.947 --> 00:39:26.530
Then we radiate back
into the universe

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:30.770
having increased its disorder
by a considerable fraction.

00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:34.325
And that explains how an
individual organism can persist

00:39:34.325 --> 00:39:36.244
and survive and sustain itself.

00:39:36.244 --> 00:39:37.910
But of course the
great thing about life

00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:41.530
is that it reproduces
and there are mutations.

00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:44.600
And therefore evolution
gets off the ground.

00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:47.170
So if our goal is
to understand how

00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:51.720
ideas like cause and effect
and even purposes can arise,

00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:53.470
evolution is a
wonderful mechanism

00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:55.420
for making that happen.

00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:57.540
Why do giraffes have long necks?

00:39:57.540 --> 00:40:00.680
Well one answer is because
of the state of the universe

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:02.230
and the laws of physics.

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:04.890
That's not a very
helpful answer, is it?

00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:08.830
Another answer is to reach these
leaves up there in the tree.

00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:11.820
Evolution can be thought
of as a search strategy

00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:13.590
for this different
genetic information,

00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:16.190
for the genome that
passes down to try

00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:19.020
to maximize the chances
of reproductive success

00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:21.150
in this particular environment.

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:26.570
And given that strategy, it's
perfectly OK to say the reason

00:40:26.570 --> 00:40:30.490
why the giraffe has a long
neck is to reach those leaves.

00:40:30.490 --> 00:40:33.940
You can also see something
like this in simple computer

00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:35.010
examples.

00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:37.970
This is a cellular automaton
invented by computer scientist

00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:39.110
Melanie Mitchell.

00:40:39.110 --> 00:40:40.780
She calls it Robby the Robot.

00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:42.220
Robby had a party last night.

00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:44.590
There are beer cans
scattered all over his house.

00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:47.346
What's the best algorithm
to pick up the beer cans?

00:40:47.346 --> 00:40:48.720
Many of you are
probably familiar

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:50.510
with genetic algorithms.

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:53.440
You just pick some random
strategies, let them evolve.

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:56.100
That is to say, find out which
ones are most successful,

00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:56.960
cull them.

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.170
Randomly mutate them.

00:40:58.170 --> 00:41:00.211
Find out which ones of
those are most successful.

00:41:00.211 --> 00:41:01.130
Repeat this.

00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:03.040
And in a very few
generations, Robbie

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:07.610
finds a better strategy than
its human designers ever found.

00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:09.470
And once it has that
strategy, are you

00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:11.660
allowed to say Robbie
is quote, unquote,

00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:14.810
trying its best to
pick up the cans?

00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:17.180
Sure, that's what
I'm trying to say.

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:20.710
There's no such thing as
a real true purpose that

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:23.980
goes above and beyond a
way of talking about what

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:25.930
happens in the physical world.

00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:28.680
Evolution, laws of physics,
and the arrow of time

00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:31.310
make it perfectly sensible
that such ways of talking

00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:35.550
would become convenient and
useful as complicated organisms

00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:37.490
adapt and go on.

00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:40.150
And that even
counts for thinking,

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:42.050
for consciousness itself.

00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:45.204
We again do not know how
consciousness arose either.

00:41:45.204 --> 00:41:46.870
We don't even know
what consciousness is

00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:48.190
or how it works.

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:50.860
But we can see little
steps that might

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:53.200
have happened along the way.

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:55.850
So Malcolm MacIver, who's
an engineer at Northwestern,

00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:59.430
likes to talk about the first
fish to flap up onto land.

00:41:59.430 --> 00:42:01.514
The evolutionary
pressures on land

00:42:01.514 --> 00:42:03.680
are very, very different
than those under the water.

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:06.430
If you're under the water,
you can't see very far.

00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:09.130
The attenuation length of
the photons is a few meters.

00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:11.650
So you're swimming around
at a few meters per second,

00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:15.340
you need to be able to
instantly react to what you see.

00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:17.230
But then you climb up
onto land, and now you

00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:18.950
can see for kilometers.

00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:22.200
So there's a whole new
evolutionary pressure which

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:24.290
is to make a smart decision.

00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:27.335
You had the time to
think about what to do.

00:42:27.335 --> 00:42:30.970
And what that means is that
developing the capacity

00:42:30.970 --> 00:42:34.560
to contemplate different
hypothetical futures

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:36.630
becomes a smart thing to do.

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:37.540
And we can look back.

00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:39.490
We can do the neuroscience
and look in your brain.

00:42:39.490 --> 00:42:41.060
What are you doing when
you're contemplating

00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:42.726
hypothetical futures,
when you're really

00:42:42.726 --> 00:42:45.650
sort of consciously
imagining different things?

00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:48.150
It's not a whole new
module of your brain.

00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:50.310
You're using the same
part of your brain

00:42:50.310 --> 00:42:52.210
that gets used when
you recall a memory.

00:42:52.210 --> 00:42:54.840
This is exactly what
evolution likes to do,

00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:58.590
to repurpose all parts of
the functional organism

00:42:58.590 --> 00:43:00.480
to do new tasks.

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:04.330
Imagining the future is one
part of being conscious.

00:43:04.330 --> 00:43:06.300
It's not the whole
thing obviously.

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:08.440
But again you could see
how it would happen.

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:11.280
We don't need to invoke
anything beyond the particles

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:15.390
and fields of the Core Theory
to explain our consciousness.

00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:17.800
Here is a picture of my head.

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:19.020
It's not to scale.

00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:21.670
But this was a map
made in the laboratory

00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:23.734
of David Poeppel at NYU.

00:43:23.734 --> 00:43:25.150
It's evidence that
I actually have

00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:28.470
a brain inside my skull,
which I was happy to see.

00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:31.610
When you have a
thought, in your neurons

00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:33.700
there are literally
charged particles jumping

00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:35.140
from one neuron to another.

00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:37.930
Any physicists will tell you,
following the Core Theory,

00:43:37.930 --> 00:43:41.990
that charged particles in
motion create magnetic fields.

00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:45.260
So this is an MEG, a
magnetoencephalograph.

00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:48.440
It is literally an image
of the tiny magnetic fields

00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:51.550
that stick outside of my skull
while I was hearing some sounds

00:43:51.550 --> 00:43:53.430
and my neurons were
going ah yes, you

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:55.700
were hearing some sounds.

00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:57.940
Now this isn't evidence
of anything very strong,

00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:00.890
just a reminder of
the obvious fact

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:03.210
that your thoughts
and your dreams

00:44:03.210 --> 00:44:05.590
and your aspirations
and your emotions

00:44:05.590 --> 00:44:09.120
are correlated with physical
goings on inside your brain.

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:11.710
We don't need to go
beyond that to explain

00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:14.150
what is it that is happening
when you are thinking.

00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:15.780
This is again an
ancient argument.

00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:17.620
It goes back to these folks.

00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:21.250
This is Renee Descartes, famous
physicist, famous mathematician

00:44:21.250 --> 00:44:22.350
also.

00:44:22.350 --> 00:44:24.470
And this is Princess
Elizabeth of Bohemia,

00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:26.950
considerably less famous.

00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:30.720
But they became friends and they
carried on a long conversation,

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:32.430
basically because
Descartes was always

00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:34.470
looking for a potential patron.

00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:37.475
And even an exiled royal family
like Princess Elizabeth's was

00:44:37.475 --> 00:44:40.170
is better than no
royal family at all.

00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:42.410
Unfortunately she did
not become his patron,

00:44:42.410 --> 00:44:45.360
and she didn't give him a
hard time about his ideas.

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:48.970
One of Descartes' favorite
ideas was mind body dualism.

00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:50.530
He felt that the
mind or the soul

00:44:50.530 --> 00:44:53.590
was something immaterial
and separate from the body.

00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:56.920
And Elizabeth pressed
him on how in the world

00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:59.255
could something immaterial
and without any location

00:44:59.255 --> 00:45:04.390
could possibly influence the
physical reality of our body.

00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:05.340
So he had a theory.

00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:07.360
This is the pineal
gland in your brain.

00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:08.860
It's the one part
of your brain that

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:11.380
is not broken into two,
two different hemispheres.

00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:13.715
So Descartes drew this
picture and literally proposed

00:45:13.715 --> 00:45:16.830
that the soul communicated
through your pineal gland

00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:18.200
with your body.

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:21.080
Nobody ever bought
this explanation.

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:23.630
But the point is that if
Elizabeth were alive today,

00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:25.970
she would point at the
equation for the Core Theory

00:45:25.970 --> 00:45:27.761
and say if you want to
believe in something

00:45:27.761 --> 00:45:29.670
over and above the
physical world,

00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:32.230
how does that change the
behavior of the particles

00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:36.140
in your brain as it is predicted
by that Core Theory equation?

00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:37.640
It's not enough to
say, well there's

00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:39.270
things we don't understand.

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:41.220
If you don't think that
the brain is simply

00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:44.800
the workings out of physical
matter at some level,

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:47.300
then you're saying
that equation is wrong.

00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:49.180
And saying how that
equation is wrong

00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:51.532
is a daunting
obstacle to overcome

00:45:51.532 --> 00:45:52.990
if you think that
the world is more

00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:55.360
than just the physical stuff.

00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:57.015
And you don't need
to think that.

00:45:57.015 --> 00:45:59.140
Even if you think the world
is just physical stuff,

00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:02.084
it's perfectly OK
to talk about things

00:46:02.084 --> 00:46:03.500
that we like to
talk about when we

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:06.220
discuss human beings like
choice and responsibility

00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:09.060
and morality, for exactly
the same reason it's

00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:12.990
OK to talk about temperature and
density and pressure in a fluid

00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:15.810
even though we know it's
really made of atoms.

00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:19.020
These are emergent
features of the world.

00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:21.660
If you're Laplace's demon,
you can predict the future.

00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:22.780
That is true.

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:25.550
There's no such thing as
free will in the world

00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:27.150
of Laplace's demon.

00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:28.990
But we're not in that world.

00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:30.290
None of us has that ability.

00:46:30.290 --> 00:46:33.320
None of us knows the
requisite information.

00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:36.450
Therefore, the best
way we have to model

00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:39.570
the behavior of real
human beings, real agents

00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:44.500
in the world, is as creatures
who are able to make decisions.

00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:48.310
The problem only arises when
you mix up the vocabularies.

00:46:48.310 --> 00:46:51.300
There are different vocabularies
that can both be true,

00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:54.367
people making choices and atoms
obeying the laws of physics.

00:46:54.367 --> 00:46:55.950
But you have to pick
one or the other.

00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:57.480
You walk up to your
closet and say,

00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:00.380
am I going to wear the red
shirt or the blue shirt?

00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:02.930
Oh, I'll just do whatever my
atoms say the laws of physics

00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:04.180
are going to tell them to do.

00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:06.449
That does not make sense.

00:47:06.449 --> 00:47:07.990
You can talk about
what your atoms do

00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:09.280
or what you're going to do.

00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:11.630
You can't talk
about both at once.

00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:14.500
So this picture of the
world as just governed

00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:17.210
by the laws of
physics isn't as bad

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:21.300
as you might think in terms
of recovering the human scale

00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:24.130
world of meaning and
mattering and so forth.

00:47:24.130 --> 00:47:27.962
But there is a downside, namely
that you're going to die.

00:47:27.962 --> 00:47:29.920
If you're made of the
stuff of the Core Theory,

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:33.510
if you're made out of the atoms
and particles, then when you

00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:36.300
die there's no place
for the information

00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:38.010
that was in your brain to go.

00:47:38.010 --> 00:47:40.100
There's no known
forces or particles

00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:43.030
that could carry that away if
your atoms are actually still

00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:44.640
there in your brain.

00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:46.070
So one way of
driving that home is

00:47:46.070 --> 00:47:48.980
to look at this
plot that was made.

00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:51.290
There's some
complexity theorists

00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:54.590
who like to study
scaling laws in biology.

00:47:54.590 --> 00:47:57.030
It turns out that
for mammals, there's

00:47:57.030 --> 00:48:01.190
a scaling law that relates
your heartbeat to your mass,

00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:05.140
and also your life
expectancy to your mass.

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:07.270
And they cancel out.

00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:10.020
So everywhere along this
curve, the total number

00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:15.340
of heartbeats in the lifespan
of a mammal is about the same.

00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:18.750
It's about 1.5
billion heartbeats.

00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:20.280
Now humans are the exception.

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:24.320
Because we invented
medicine, Obamacare, and now

00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:27.460
we live for about
twice as long as you

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:30.186
would have predicted on the
basis of this scaling relation.

00:48:30.186 --> 00:48:32.060
But then again before
we had modern medicine,

00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:36.440
we lived for 30 or 40
years, right on the line.

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:41.450
So that means that we get
about 3 billion heartbeats

00:48:41.450 --> 00:48:42.610
in our lives.

00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:44.750
There's no law of
physics that says this.

00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:47.780
Biological progress can
certainly extend our lifespan

00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:49.160
way, way longer than this.

00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:51.110
But we're not there yet.

00:48:51.110 --> 00:48:53.485
And if you believe that you
are a bunch of particles that

00:48:53.485 --> 00:48:55.700
are interacting
under that equation,

00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:57.600
this is the span of your life.

00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:00.120
You do not continue
on after that.

00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:02.550
And the 3 billion is
kind of a big number.

00:49:02.550 --> 00:49:04.130
3 billion is pretty
big, but it's not

00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:06.930
limitless by any stretch
of the imagination.

00:49:06.930 --> 00:49:10.360
To me, claims like
well, if I'm just stuff

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:12.520
obeying the laws of physics
removes all the meaning

00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:15.870
and mattering from my
life don't hold water,

00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:17.390
because to me the
fact that I only

00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:19.240
have this small
period of time makes

00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:21.980
every little bit of that
period much more precious.

00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:25.495
Every one of your heartbeats
should be used to good effect.

00:49:25.495 --> 00:49:26.870
One way I like to
drive this home

00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:32.950
is the last slide is the pale
blue dot image of the Earth.

00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:35.740
So the "Voyager" spacecraft,
one of the first spacecraft that

00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:38.820
left the solar system, when
it was 4 billion miles away,

00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:41.140
Carl Sagan and his
team convinced NASA

00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:42.902
to turn it around
and take a parting

00:49:42.902 --> 00:49:45.360
shot, a photograph of the Earth
and the rest of the planets

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:46.400
in the solar system.

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:48.880
So that little dot is us.

00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:51.500
That's the Earth,
the pale blue dot.

00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:54.310
Every human being who has
ever lived is in that picture,

00:49:54.310 --> 00:49:57.199
or at least their atoms
are in that picture.

00:49:57.199 --> 00:49:58.740
So on the one hand,
it makes you feel

00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:02.600
very small to think that all of
us are just in that little bit.

00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:05.150
And this is not anywhere
near the whole universe

00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:07.040
that we're looking at right now.

00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:09.880
On the other hand, we
did take the picture.

00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:11.940
That's pretty good.

00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:15.150
It's a selfie for
the whole Earth.

00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:16.690
"Voyager's" just
an elaborate selfie

00:50:16.690 --> 00:50:19.600
stick out there letting us
take a picture of ourselves.

00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:22.140
But you know what, the
ability to take a selfie

00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:23.717
shouldn't be underestimated.

00:50:23.717 --> 00:50:25.800
It is a reflection of the
fact that even though we

00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:28.010
are very tiny compared
to the universe,

00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:32.410
both in space and in time,
we are in that complex phase.

00:50:32.410 --> 00:50:35.730
We are part of the universe
that has gained the ability

00:50:35.730 --> 00:50:38.590
to think about ourselves, to
be self aware, to make choices

00:50:38.590 --> 00:50:40.980
for ourselves on the basis
of rational reflection,

00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:43.560
to create technological
marvels that

00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:46.420
can help us look at ourselves
and think about what to do next

00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:48.850
rather than just moving
from moment to moment.

00:50:48.850 --> 00:50:52.050
That's both the world we
live in, which is true,

00:50:52.050 --> 00:50:55.610
and it's a world that we can
try to work towards making

00:50:55.610 --> 00:50:57.920
the best we can, which is good.

00:50:57.920 --> 00:50:58.790
Thank you very much.

00:50:58.790 --> 00:51:01.778
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:06.565 --> 00:51:08.190
AUDIENCE: So you
connected the Big Bang

00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:10.100
to the arrow of
time and the fact

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:12.400
that the past seems
different from the future.

00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:14.200
Can you also sort
of use it to give

00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:17.794
an explanation for why it seems
impossible to go back in time?

00:51:17.794 --> 00:51:19.085
SEAN CARROLL: Well, yes and no.

00:51:19.085 --> 00:51:20.210
So this is a good question.

00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:21.970
The question is,
there's an arrow of time

00:51:21.970 --> 00:51:24.530
that we attribute to low
entropy of the Big Bang.

00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:27.520
What about going
backward in time?

00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:30.220
Mostly the fact that we
can't go back in time

00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:32.960
is because time is
only one dimensional.

00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:34.120
That's the real reason.

00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:37.355
We can go around in
space because space

00:51:37.355 --> 00:51:38.400
is three dimensional.

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:40.530
If time were two
dimensional, there'd

00:51:40.530 --> 00:51:43.201
be no trouble to go
back to the past.

00:51:43.201 --> 00:51:45.700
Basically the fact that time
is one dimensional and the fact

00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:48.799
that the world happens once
at every moment in time

00:51:48.799 --> 00:51:50.840
means there's just no way
to get there from here.

00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:53.890
It is actually not
in any direct way

00:51:53.890 --> 00:51:57.121
related to what we
call the arrow of time.

00:51:57.121 --> 00:51:59.190
Now that's complicated
by the fact that

00:51:59.190 --> 00:52:02.100
in Einstein's theory of general
relativity, space and time

00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:02.707
are flexible.

00:52:02.707 --> 00:52:05.290
And you can imagine building a
wormhole or something like that

00:52:05.290 --> 00:52:06.860
that would get into the past.

00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:08.610
And remember I said
just a few slides ago

00:52:08.610 --> 00:52:11.680
that our impression that
there is free will and choice

00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:15.660
is ultimately because entropy
is increasing toward the future.

00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:18.740
So if you were able to hop in a
wormhole like an "Interstellar"

00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:22.980
and go into the past,
then your personal future

00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:25.280
would be the past
of the universe.

00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:26.574
And which one wins?

00:52:26.574 --> 00:52:28.240
And that's a very
good question to which

00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:29.406
no one has the right answer.

00:52:29.406 --> 00:52:31.600
Probably the simple
answer is you can't do it,

00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:33.670
you can't go backward in time.

00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:36.220
AUDIENCE: The
emergent properties

00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:39.560
that come out of
atoms or of us, do

00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:40.940
you think they're determined?

00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:43.617
You said they're implicit.

00:52:43.617 --> 00:52:45.200
Do they have to
happen, or could there

00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:48.560
be other emerging properties
from the same particles?

00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:51.997
SEAN CARROLL: Well this
is a good question too.

00:52:51.997 --> 00:52:54.080
Are the emergent properties
determined in some way

00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:56.930
from the underlying stuff?

00:52:56.930 --> 00:52:57.830
Yes and no.

00:52:57.830 --> 00:53:00.180
I mean ultimately the
answer is yes in the sense

00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:02.780
that if you believe
everything I've said,

00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:04.740
then given that Core
Theory equation,

00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:07.202
you could put it on a computer
and uniquely find out what

00:53:07.202 --> 00:53:08.860
would happen in the future.

00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:10.690
So in that sense
everything is determined.

00:53:10.690 --> 00:53:13.300
There's the one
very large footnote

00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:15.240
to that, which is of
course quantum mechanics

00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:17.460
introduces some
uncertainty of the game.

00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:20.160
As I personally am an
advocate of the many worlds

00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:21.840
interpretation where
everything's still

00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:23.970
is 100% deterministic,
but not everyone

00:53:23.970 --> 00:53:25.650
agrees with me about that.

00:53:25.650 --> 00:53:29.640
So that doesn't give you any
help whatsoever in the emergent

00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:30.485
properties business.

00:53:30.485 --> 00:53:31.235
It's still a rule.

00:53:31.235 --> 00:53:33.110
It's just a boring
rule for probabilities

00:53:33.110 --> 00:53:35.280
rather than some
deterministic rule.

00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:37.540
So on the one hand,
if you knew everything

00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:40.210
and had Laplacian demon
level intelligence

00:53:40.210 --> 00:53:42.740
about the underlying stuff,
the future is determined.

00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:44.365
The emergent properties
are determined.

00:53:44.365 --> 00:53:45.620
That's the whole story.

00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:48.820
On the other hand, you
do gain new knowledge

00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:51.730
by figuring out what those
emergent properties are.

00:53:51.730 --> 00:53:53.890
You have a way of talking
about the system that

00:53:53.890 --> 00:53:57.030
is extremely
algorithmically compressed

00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:59.790
compared to the microscopic
way of talking about it.

00:53:59.790 --> 00:54:03.850
So even though the
behavior is determined,

00:54:03.850 --> 00:54:06.480
you do learn something new by
figuring out what the higher

00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:08.220
level laws really are.

00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:11.030
And the higher level
laws could be true even

00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:12.770
with different underlying stuff.

00:54:12.770 --> 00:54:15.190
The underlying stuff determines
the higher level laws,

00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:16.576
but not vice versa.

00:54:19.286 --> 00:54:21.660
The way to become a successful
biologist or psychologists

00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:23.325
is not to study
particle physics.

00:54:23.325 --> 00:54:26.190
That's the
fundamental rule here.

00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:30.670
AUDIENCE: So you said that the
Core Theory sort of explains

00:54:30.670 --> 00:54:34.720
like-- and it will remain
true for forever basically.

00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:39.250
So at different
moments in our history

00:54:39.250 --> 00:54:42.690
we've had this sort
of view of physics

00:54:42.690 --> 00:54:44.340
or mechanics or whatever.

00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:47.750
What makes this moment in
human history different,

00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:50.687
like whatever we know
will never change?

00:54:50.687 --> 00:54:53.020
SEAN CARROLL: Well again,
it's not that whatever we know

00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:53.850
will never change.

00:54:53.850 --> 00:54:56.630
It's that very particular way
of talking about the universe

00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:57.620
will remain accurate.

00:54:57.620 --> 00:55:00.725
Like Newtonian gravity
was well established.

00:55:00.725 --> 00:55:03.170
Of course now we know
that the vocabulary

00:55:03.170 --> 00:55:06.305
used by Newtonian gravity is
not the best vocabulary to use.

00:55:06.305 --> 00:55:08.430
Einstein's theory of general
relativity came along,

00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:11.317
gave us a very good,
better way of talking.

00:55:11.317 --> 00:55:12.900
And the whole
vocabulary is different.

00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:15.940
Einstein talks about curved
space time and energy momentum.

00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:18.450
Newton talks about absolute
space and time and forces

00:55:18.450 --> 00:55:19.750
and so forth.

00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:22.040
But it remains true
that if you want

00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:23.890
to get a rocket from
the Earth to the Moon,

00:55:23.890 --> 00:55:27.320
you put Newton's equations
into the computer.

00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:30.735
So there is a certain
level of establishedness

00:55:30.735 --> 00:55:33.380
that a scientific
theory has passed

00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:37.386
which it might be improved upon,
but it will not be discarded.

00:55:37.386 --> 00:55:39.510
If you're thinking about
things like the phlogiston

00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:43.630
model of combustion or the
plum pudding model of the atom,

00:55:43.630 --> 00:55:46.400
those were never
accepted as correct.

00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:48.007
The Core Theory
is just as likely

00:55:48.007 --> 00:55:50.340
to remain true as this statement
that this table is made

00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:52.469
of atoms is likely to be true.

00:55:52.469 --> 00:55:54.010
You might have a
better understanding

00:55:54.010 --> 00:55:55.877
of what atoms are,
but the table's

00:55:55.877 --> 00:55:57.460
not going to stop
being made of atoms.

00:55:57.460 --> 00:55:59.710
AUDIENCE: What are you
working on these days?

00:55:59.710 --> 00:56:01.040
SEAN CARROLL: What am I
working on these days?

00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:02.880
I'm working on doing
exactly this thing, which

00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:05.460
is making a better version of
the underlying laws of physics.

00:56:08.370 --> 00:56:11.030
We do have this problem that
quantum mechanics and gravity

00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:14.300
do not play well together
in extreme conditions,

00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:16.950
near the Big Bang, near the
black holes and so forth.

00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:18.940
So there are some
of us who think

00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:22.360
that space and time themselves
are not fundamental,

00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:24.760
that we need to do better at
a quantum mechanical level

00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:27.640
of figuring out how space
and time themselves are

00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:30.050
emergent from a deeper
level of description.

00:56:30.050 --> 00:56:34.800
So I actually am
ambivalent about time.

00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:36.820
Time may or may
not be fundamental.

00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:40.670
I'm 99% convinced that
space is not fundamental,

00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:42.529
and it's somehow a
good approximation

00:56:42.529 --> 00:56:44.820
just like the fluid description
of the air this room is

00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:46.940
a good approximation, even
though it's ultimately

00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:48.580
made of atoms.

00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:50.330
AUDIENCE: To a lay
person, you say

00:56:50.330 --> 00:56:54.280
that the evolution of particles
is pretty well described

00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:55.550
by the Core Theory.

00:56:55.550 --> 00:56:58.510
But the process of
statistical mechanics

00:56:58.510 --> 00:57:00.800
seems a little bit
more hand wavy.

00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:03.590
It seems as though the way you
enumerate states of the world

00:57:03.590 --> 00:57:05.660
and group them into
categories really

00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:09.650
determines the predictions of
your theories to a wild extent.

00:57:09.650 --> 00:57:11.240
Where do we stand
on the evolution

00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:14.225
of statistical mechanics then?

00:57:14.225 --> 00:57:16.350
SEAN CARROLL: You point
our a very important point.

00:57:16.350 --> 00:57:18.980
It's actually related
to the earlier question.

00:57:18.980 --> 00:57:23.940
Statistical mechanics speaks
a language of core screening

00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:25.800
and macroscopic states.

00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:27.570
So if you have a bunch
of air in this room

00:57:27.570 --> 00:57:30.600
like we have right now
and it's made of air atoms

00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:35.270
and molecules, you want to
describe it in a course grained

00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:37.370
way as a fluid
with a temperature

00:57:37.370 --> 00:57:39.120
and a pressure and a density.

00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:41.110
Well that's one way
of describing it.

00:57:41.110 --> 00:57:43.140
That's one sort of
macroscopic description.

00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:44.140
But there are many ways.

00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:45.700
For example when we
really coarse grain,

00:57:45.700 --> 00:57:47.366
we really take a
little region of space,

00:57:47.366 --> 00:57:49.900
like one cubic
millimeter in size.

00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:51.692
We take the average
number of particles

00:57:51.692 --> 00:57:53.400
and the average motion
of those particles

00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:55.490
and we relate them to
macroscopic features

00:57:55.490 --> 00:58:00.160
of temperature and density
and pressure and so forth.

00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:01.660
But who says that's
what you can do?

00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:04.760
You could imagine taking a
little tiny cube in momentum

00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:07.057
space rather than
physical space.

00:58:07.057 --> 00:58:08.390
You could coarse grain that way.

00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:11.060
You could reduce your number
of variables that way.

00:58:11.060 --> 00:58:14.210
What you would end up
getting is a horrendous mess.

00:58:14.210 --> 00:58:17.340
And that's because given the
actual configuration of stuff

00:58:17.340 --> 00:58:20.250
in the world and
the laws of physics,

00:58:20.250 --> 00:58:22.950
there's some
reductions from many,

00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:26.260
many particles to much smaller
macroscopic descriptions that

00:58:26.260 --> 00:58:29.360
work nicely, and
some that don't.

00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:33.110
So even though it in principle
sounds very arbitrary,

00:58:33.110 --> 00:58:36.280
in practice this gain in
knowledge and understanding

00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:38.890
that you get from moving
to the macro level

00:58:38.890 --> 00:58:40.910
is highly, highly constrained.

00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:43.809
We don't know all the details of
how it should work in general.

00:58:43.809 --> 00:58:46.100
It's usually something where
we know it when we see it,

00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:48.010
which is not nearly
satisfying enough.

00:58:48.010 --> 00:58:49.990
We want to do better.

00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:53.950
But there does not seem to
be multiple incompatible

00:58:53.950 --> 00:58:58.080
macroscopic descriptions of
the same realistic underlying

00:58:58.080 --> 00:58:59.080
stuff.

00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:01.057
There might be in
special circumstances,

00:59:01.057 --> 00:59:03.390
but in the real world that
doesn't seem to be a problem.

00:59:03.390 --> 00:59:06.350
So I think there's
an interesting issue

00:59:06.350 --> 00:59:08.350
at the intersection of
philosophy and physics

00:59:08.350 --> 00:59:11.760
here about why that is the case,
but in practice that really

00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:14.075
does seem to be the case.

00:59:14.075 --> 00:59:16.700
AUDIENCE: You spoke a little bit
earlier about the Higgs field,

00:59:16.700 --> 00:59:18.658
and when you excite it
you get the Higgs boson.

00:59:18.658 --> 00:59:21.200
And then you also mentioned
that there might even

00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:24.246
be a new particle
on the horizon as we

00:59:24.246 --> 00:59:25.870
add more and more
energy to the systems

00:59:25.870 --> 00:59:28.210
or simulate our collisions.

00:59:28.210 --> 00:59:31.150
Do you foresee that
we'll just keep

00:59:31.150 --> 00:59:33.571
discovering that there's an
infinite number of particles?

00:59:33.571 --> 00:59:35.820
And actually I have an even
more fundamental question,

00:59:35.820 --> 00:59:39.110
which is what is the meaning
of these particles that

00:59:39.110 --> 00:59:42.007
exist almost for
less than an instant?

00:59:42.007 --> 00:59:42.840
SEAN CARROLL: Right.

00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:44.440
And although these
are good questions,

00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:46.840
I don't think there are an
infinite number of varieties

00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:47.480
of particles.

00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:48.890
This is just my guess.

00:59:48.890 --> 00:59:49.520
What do I know?

00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:51.740
We don't know is the only
correct and humble thing

00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:53.380
to say.

00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:56.175
But I think that given
the existence of gravity,

00:59:56.175 --> 00:59:58.300
you can't have particles
that are infinitely heavy.

00:59:58.300 --> 01:00:00.330
They become black
holes at some point.

01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:01.909
So there's probably
some finiteness

01:00:01.909 --> 01:00:03.950
to a list of all the
different kinds of particles

01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:06.602
we can imagine having.

01:00:06.602 --> 01:00:08.060
Sorry, what was
the other question?

01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:09.765
AUDIENCE: What was
the point of those?

01:00:09.765 --> 01:00:11.130
SEAN CARROLL: Oh, what's
the point of them?

01:00:11.130 --> 01:00:12.360
Oh, they're not a point.

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:13.280
They're just there.

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:15.070
Not everything needs
to have a point.

01:00:15.070 --> 01:00:17.045
Things can just be.

01:00:17.045 --> 01:00:19.070
AUDIENCE: And how
can you be so sure

01:00:19.070 --> 01:00:21.570
that those pointless
particles don't

01:00:21.570 --> 01:00:23.649
have a point in our
everyday existence?

01:00:23.649 --> 01:00:25.440
SEAN CARROLL: Well,
that's a good question.

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:27.400
In the six hour
version of this talk

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:32.180
or in the book that you can
buy right now, I explain why.

01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:34.750
Basically there's different
ways that other particles

01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:35.830
could exist.

01:00:35.830 --> 01:00:38.920
They could be so heavy
that you need a $10 billion

01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:41.190
particle accelerator
to make them.

01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:43.690
They could be so short lived
that even if you bring them

01:00:43.690 --> 01:00:46.140
into existence, they
disappear almost instantly.

01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:47.990
Or they could be so
weakly interacting

01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:50.031
that even if they were
there, they would go right

01:00:50.031 --> 01:00:50.800
through your body.

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:53.300
All these are ways that
particles could have avoided

01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:55.710
detection, but in
every case, they

01:00:55.710 --> 01:00:58.104
will not be interesting or
useful in your everyday life.

01:00:58.104 --> 01:00:59.270
They would not have a point.

01:00:59.270 --> 01:01:03.530
AUDIENCE: But would they have a
point to any important feature

01:01:03.530 --> 01:01:05.721
or fact about the universe?

01:01:05.721 --> 01:01:07.470
SEAN CARROLL: Yeah,
they might play a role

01:01:07.470 --> 01:01:10.080
in sort of understanding how
the different forces of nature

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:12.820
unify at high energies
or something like that.

01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:16.240
But again, the idea
that things have points

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.910
is not part of the
fundamental nature of reality.

01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:23.250
This level of meaning
and purpose and causality

01:01:23.250 --> 01:01:25.121
is a higher level
emergent thing.

01:01:25.121 --> 01:01:26.620
It's not something
we have the right

01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:30.310
to demand from the fundamental
architecture of reality.

01:01:30.310 --> 01:01:32.560
AUDIENCE: You mentioned that
you were somewhat certain

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:36.200
that space was
not a fundamental.

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:40.400
What gave you that certainty
or what gave you that evidence?

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:43.260
SEAN CARROLL: So why do I think
that space is more likely to be

01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:45.640
nonfundamental than time?

01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:48.630
For one thing, quantum
mechanics intrinsically

01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:51.134
treats time and space
very differently.

01:01:51.134 --> 01:01:53.050
The fundamental equation
of quantum mechanics,

01:01:53.050 --> 01:01:55.730
Schrodinger's equation,
has time in it,

01:01:55.730 --> 01:01:58.460
but it doesn't have
space, in general.

01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:01.330
So there's a chance that time
really is fundamental just

01:02:01.330 --> 01:02:02.174
for that reason.

01:02:02.174 --> 01:02:03.590
The Schrodinger
equation might not

01:02:03.590 --> 01:02:05.140
be right, might not be
the right description,

01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:06.950
so that's why we are
still not certain.

01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:08.890
But there's at least
a fighting chance.

01:02:08.890 --> 01:02:12.210
Whereas space is just
obviously not fundamental.

01:02:12.210 --> 01:02:17.130
Space is something where, when
you go from classical mechanics

01:02:17.130 --> 01:02:20.532
to quantum mechanics, space
more or less disappears.

01:02:20.532 --> 01:02:21.990
In classical
mechanics, what do you

01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:23.770
have-- some particles
moving through space

01:02:23.770 --> 01:02:25.294
with some velocity.

01:02:25.294 --> 01:02:27.210
In quantum mechanics,
you have a wave function

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:28.480
of all those particles.

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:31.310
And that wave function,
we tend to talk a language

01:02:31.310 --> 01:02:34.660
that the wave function is a
function of all the particles

01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:36.700
in their locations in space.

01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:39.540
But we don't have to
talk that language.

01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:42.134
We can use what is called the
momentum space description.

01:02:42.134 --> 01:02:43.800
We can completely
describe the particles

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:45.591
by how fast they're
moving instead of where

01:02:45.591 --> 01:02:46.950
they are in the universe.

01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:48.366
And for that matter,
we don't need

01:02:48.366 --> 01:02:49.840
to use any description at all.

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:52.460
We can just use these
quantum mechanical states

01:02:52.460 --> 01:02:56.570
in their own right, with no
reference to space whatsoever.

01:02:56.570 --> 01:02:58.550
So the kind of thing
I'm doing right now

01:02:58.550 --> 01:03:01.530
is trying to figure out ways
to answer the question, someone

01:03:01.530 --> 01:03:05.390
hands you a wave function,
the quantum mechanical state.

01:03:05.390 --> 01:03:07.995
Can you figure out
what it is describing

01:03:07.995 --> 01:03:10.880
at the classical level,
how many particles moving,

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:13.071
what kind of dimensional
space, et cetera?

01:03:13.071 --> 01:03:15.320
So everything we know about
quantum mechanics, quantum

01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:17.051
gravity, et cetera,
denigrates space

01:03:17.051 --> 01:03:19.050
into something that is
just a good approximation

01:03:19.050 --> 01:03:19.901
of low energies.

01:03:20.050 --> 01:03:20.550
Thank you.

01:03:20.550 --> 01:03:22.100
