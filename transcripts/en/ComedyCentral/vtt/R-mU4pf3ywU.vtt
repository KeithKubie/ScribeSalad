00:00:02.269 --> 00:00:05.873
JOHN PEMBERTON WAS TRYING
TO MAKE PATENT MEDICINES.

00:00:05.906 --> 00:00:07.808
BASICALLY,
THEY WERE FAKE MEDICINES,

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:11.979
AND MOST OF THEM WERE JUST,
LIKE, HERBAL WHOSIWHATS.

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:13.313
WHO EVEN CARES?

00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:17.117
WE WAS JUST TRYING TO MAKE
ANYTHING THAT WOULD SELL.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.654
WE WAS LIKE,
I WANT TO MAKE A FAKE MEDICINE

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:23.056
THAT MADE WOMEN THINK
THAT THEY'LL NEVER BE NERVOUS

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.993
OR HAVE FARTS...

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:28.362
AND MAKE MEN THINK
THAT THEY CAN BE SMARTER.

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:33.800
SO HE DECIDED TO USE
A NEW INGREDIENT, COCA.

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:36.203
COCA IS FROM A PLANT.

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:38.605
THE SOUTH AMERICANS
WOULD CHEW IT,

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:40.107
AND BE LIKE,
WE HAD SO MUCH ENERGY,

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.409
AND WE WEREN'T EVEN HUNGRY,
AND WE HIKED THE WHOLE ANDES.

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:43.443
[laughs]
BUT REALLY,

00:00:43.477 --> 00:00:45.546
THEY WERE
JUST ON COCAINE.

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.248
JOHN PEMBERTON WAS LIKE,
OH, I SHOULD PUT THIS

00:00:48.282 --> 00:00:50.684
INTO MY NEW POTION
THAT I'M MAKING.

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:53.687
AND BASICALLY, HE COPIED
SOMEONE ELSE'S RECIPE,

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.757
CALLED, LIKE,
"VIN MARIANI."

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.193
HE WAS LIKE,
WELL, I HAVE WINE.

00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:03.864
I PUT COCA IN THERE,
A LITTLE OF THIS KOLA IN.

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:06.900
THE KOLA NUT RELEASED
A LITTLE BIT OF CAFFEINE.

00:01:08.302 --> 00:01:12.206
AND HE--HE BASICALLY
WAS LIKE,

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:14.775
WHAT I GIVE YOU
IS WINE WITH COCAINE--

00:01:14.808 --> 00:01:16.310
[laughs]
CAFFEINE.

00:01:16.343 --> 00:01:18.378
THEN, PEOPLE IN ATLANTA
WERE LIKE,

00:01:18.412 --> 00:01:22.783
NO, NOBODY CAN SELL ALCOHOL
BECAUSE OF TEMPERANCE.
