00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.880
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:08.810
Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast and

3
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.370
<v 1>Ahhh,</v>

4
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:12.303
<v 0>okay.</v>

5
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:15.030
<v 1>Ah,</v>

6
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.960
<v 0>just checking in on Ya.</v>

7
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.380
Just chicken and on you to see all your weeks go and

8
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.010
Vivian was mainly to play. Um, I'm in New York City.

9
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.880
If I can wake up in a city that blows me just for being there and where my

10
00:00:34.021 --> 00:00:39.021
fucking sweat pants while eating tad steaks.

11
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.470
There's so many people not make it into New York,

12
00:00:43.471 --> 00:00:46.930
but they play that fucking song and everybody thinks they're making it right.

13
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.340
<v 2>The</v>

14
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.340
<v 0>fucking homeless people are taking public shits on the subway grades and a drop</v>

15
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.460
down on Wall Street people.

16
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.570
Now that was the 90s it all gradually went away.

17
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.300
It all went away and now there's like bicycles and chairs in the streets.

18
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.460
This is all shit I might be talking about tonight.

19
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.940
I am in New York for my final press stop and then I am done hyping the a for the

20
00:01:20.481 --> 00:01:24.350
most part I'm done. I opened the second season of f is for family.

21
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.540
I told you was out there take it or leave it.

22
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.030
You either want to watch it or you don't.

23
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.250
I'm going to be doing a Steven Cole bear tonight.

24
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.510
How ever it will not air until tomorrow.

25
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.470
So one of the hardest things about doing his show tonight is,

26
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.160
aside from the fact I believe he tapes at the Ed Sullivan Theater,

27
00:01:43.161 --> 00:01:45.260
which is where I used to do stand up when I did Letterman,

28
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.500
which is where the Beatles, you know, did their thing,

29
00:01:50.501 --> 00:01:55.270
which is where Jackie Mason allegedly flipped off somebody,

30
00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.320
you know when he's still maintains, he didn't back on the Ed Sullivan show.

31
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.290
Okay. It was Ken who, if you want to go far enough back,

32
00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:06.450
I'm sure there was some date of Americans just chilling out.

33
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.930
They're eating a fucking rabbit. They can look at this paradise.

34
00:02:09.931 --> 00:02:11.820
It's like the entire Strip of Manhattan.

35
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.410
It all looks like central park and the other Indian native American goes,

36
00:02:16.411 --> 00:02:19.410
what the fuck is central park at any points to a shipper,

37
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.660
white people coming over the horizon. These fucking people tell you about it.

38
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.270
The first fucking Quakers would they Quaker.

39
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.700
What's the difference between Quakers and those people with the buckles on their

40
00:02:32.701 --> 00:02:37.380
hat? That first stopped off at Plymouth Rock, if that ever happened on the Nina,

41
00:02:37.381 --> 00:02:42.000
the Pinta and the Santa Marina. Santa Maria, Nina,

42
00:02:42.001 --> 00:02:44.310
the Pinta the center. But they sound like they're from Spain. Right?

43
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.950
Why were they a bunch of white people from England?

44
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.100
Oh, Brian in Spanish boats. This is like f one. Let me get this straight.

45
00:02:55.101 --> 00:02:58.430
This is the, this is the team from India, yet they have a Mercedes engine.

46
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.400
Um, all right, I'm all over the map. I'm all over the map.

47
00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:08.380
I need to get focused. All right. I am pretty focused. I'll tell you why.

48
00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.250
He will tell you why old Billy. No Fun. Oh, you know, it was Billy, you know,

49
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:14.500
half a fun. You know,

50
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.100
cause I was still celebrating my birthday so I had a couple of glasses of wine,

51
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.300
you know, sitting there like I was sophisticated. Like I read, you know,

52
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:23.400
like I was a socialite.

53
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.490
Like I was the kind of person that you just invite to a party because I'm an

54
00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:31.390
interesting person to have there. You know, you ever seen that? Like in France,

55
00:03:31.391 --> 00:03:35.320
they still have socialites. They some, I don't know how they make a living,

56
00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:39.370
but they're just these people who don't really have jobs and if you have a

57
00:03:39.371 --> 00:03:42.160
party, it's not a party unless you invite this person in.

58
00:03:42.161 --> 00:03:47.161
Everybody's dying to get into the circle that they stand in to discuss anything

59
00:03:47.711 --> 00:03:52.000
from art to world politics to fashion.

60
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.800
Not saying that fashion isn't an art form. Okay.

61
00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.220
For all the fucking dressmakers who listen to this.

62
00:04:00.221 --> 00:04:03.040
I have a lot of dressmakers by the way, that listen to this podcast, you know,

63
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.000
a lot of them always have to stop and hit rewind because some of their sequences

64
00:04:07.001 --> 00:04:11.620
hit the floor and they couldn't quite make out what I was saying. Um,

65
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:14.291
what am I saying?

66
00:04:14.291 --> 00:04:17.560
My voice is in the same register as sequence hitting the floor, I think.

67
00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:18.394
I think I am.

68
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.140
I think that's the most roundabout way anybody has ever called themselves.

69
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.210
You know a bit of a Nancy boy. Oh, you mean the guy with these,

70
00:04:28.211 --> 00:04:32.410
these sequin tone voice. All right.

71
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.670
What am I saying here on cake? I got, I have a, I have a major,

72
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.210
major announcement on so many different levels here. All right.

73
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.100
I hope you're sitting down. I'm pregnant. Okay.

74
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.190
I was taking these hormones to try and lose weight and I grew a womb.

75
00:04:50.241 --> 00:04:53.140
Somehow I got abs, but you know, there's always, you know,

76
00:04:53.141 --> 00:04:56.590
you can't have your cake and eat it and somehow I got pregnant, you know,

77
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.380
you wouldn't think, you know, I somehow while jerking off, sorry. Anyways, uh,

78
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.930
what I want to say here is, um, versus uh,

79
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.090
Paul Versey. I'm doing this bed. All right.

80
00:05:12.091 --> 00:05:16.420
The all things comedy network is going to be producing their first hour long

81
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.250
standup special. And the person who we picked to do it is, uh,

82
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.410
my good friend friend of the podcast. Um,

83
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.230
one of the four horsemen on the road that I take out there,

84
00:05:29.231 --> 00:05:34.231
Paul Versey is going to be doing a special tickets are on sale now.

85
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.270
All right. And, um,

86
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.550
this actually the idea of this was brought to us by his good friend Saturday

87
00:05:42.551 --> 00:05:47.120
night live zone, Pete Davidson, Pete Davidson, Al,

88
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.000
all things comedies, Al Madrigal and myself are all gonna be involved,

89
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.950
um, with producing this standup special. And, uh,

90
00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.210
me and Pete will be going on. Um, the night of, uh,

91
00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.850
Paul's shows, he's going to be doing two shows on August 13th,

92
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:09.851
one at 7:00 PM one at 9:30 PM at the Tarrytown music hall in Tarrytown,

93
00:06:11.301 --> 00:06:16.010
New York. Um, one of my favorite theaters out there. And, um,

94
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.970
Paul's obviously going to be closing, doing his special. And in the beginning,

95
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.450
uh, me and Pete are gonna mess around and whatever. Do some stuff,

96
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.201
make you laugh,

97
00:06:24.201 --> 00:06:27.230
warm up the crowd for Paul and Paul's going to absolutely kill it.

98
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.810
This is the biggest thing that I've done in my career.

99
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.380
I've never produced anything like this. We'll put in a lot of money out there.

100
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.620
Uh, Paul is a based, um,

101
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:42.020
it would mean the world to me and DePaul and it was family. Maggie East,

102
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.970
all Becky's here. A few guys came down. Um, tickets are only 20 bucks.

103
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.800
Um, I'll be hanging out, meeting people after the show. Whenever you want to do,

104
00:06:51.801 --> 00:06:53.420
I'll fucking whatever you want me to do,

105
00:06:53.421 --> 00:06:55.970
just whatever I have to do to fill this thing up.

106
00:06:55.971 --> 00:06:59.300
So Paul Versey can do his special here. So, uh,

107
00:06:59.301 --> 00:07:01.160
we're going to have the ticket link and everything like that.

108
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.940
The tickets are live, whatever the, the, you can buy them right now.

109
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:06.800
You can pull over in your car,

110
00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:10.760
you can continue to drive and run that risk and try to buy tickets while you're

111
00:07:10.761 --> 00:07:14.060
driving. Um, August 13th,

112
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:18.210
it's a Sunday night in August on the 13th, uh,

113
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:21.830
7:00 PM 9:30 PM the Tarrytown music hall.

114
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.100
Um, it's gonna be a huge night. Really looking forward to itself. Oh,

115
00:07:28.101 --> 00:07:30.710
and also, you know what else I forgot to bring up? Holy Shit.

116
00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:35.420
The F is for family. I tweeted about it. We finally, we got some march,

117
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:39.320
we got t-shirts, we got some for the ladies,

118
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:43.430
for the men, you know, some for the boys and girls.

119
00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:45.920
We got everything down there. You know, we've got some Kevin shirts,

120
00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.550
frank shirts, efforts for family shirts. Vic shirts, you know,

121
00:07:49.551 --> 00:07:52.010
and just when you think you have all the bases covered, people go,

122
00:07:52.011 --> 00:07:54.080
what about this character? Why don't you have his shit?

123
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:58.040
And I think because they're going mainstream at first and then eventually

124
00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:02.640
everybody will have some stuff. All right. Anyways,

125
00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.860
so let's get down to what the fuck went on this week. The big story yet that,

126
00:08:07.861 --> 00:08:10.970
that taboo to, to do condom [inaudible]

127
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.880
and a money Mayweather. I don't even know his first name.

128
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:21.710
The Floyd, Floyd money moneymaking. Get money.

129
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:26.510
Mayweather are going to have a boxing match in August.

130
00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.630
Pay per view. What do you guys think about this?

131
00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:34.660
Are you going to take your hard earned paper that is backed by no gold or you're

132
00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:37.700
going to write a piece, a number on a piece of paper,

133
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.500
stick it in another piece of paper and mail it to the paper.

134
00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:47.450
View people to watch this fight. Do you think, hey, this is fucking amazing.

135
00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:48.373
Or B,

136
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:52.880
this has got to be one of the dumbest fucking things I've ever heard in my life.

137
00:08:55.410 --> 00:09:00.030
Um, you know, make, I'm a fucking curmudgeon. Um, but I'm also wrong a lot.

138
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.910
God knows that God knows I'm wrong. I mean,

139
00:09:02.911 --> 00:09:05.550
I didn't know something the other day what somebody correct me on.

140
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.210
I didn't know about Kryptonite people, you know,

141
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:12.960
and that's what I love about my fan base on this podcast. They're smart enough,

142
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:14.491
you know,

143
00:09:14.491 --> 00:09:19.491
when I make a major full pause such as that of not describing Superman's planet

144
00:09:19.501 --> 00:09:23.400
blowing up and what Kryptonite really is, you know,

145
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:26.940
I will always regret that and I'll never be able to apologize long enough.

146
00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:31.200
A lot of people had to apologize over the last couple of weeks in my industry

147
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:35.220
and I'm, and they've put their controversies behind them,

148
00:09:35.221 --> 00:09:38.790
but I don't think I'll ever outlive not knowing, um,

149
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:42.810
what Kryptonite was and I, I accept full responsibility.

150
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:49.080
Um, anyways, I this just like the dumbest fucking thing ever. Okay.

151
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:53.640
Connor McGregor fights for a living. Mayweather fights for a living, but that's,

152
00:09:53.641 --> 00:09:58.320
that's it. So they're just gonna box. All right.

153
00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:00.990
They're going to be wearing the fucking 16 ounce gloves,

154
00:10:00.991 --> 00:10:04.200
whatever the fuck a box awares at this is,

155
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:06.750
this is the stupidest fucking thing ever. This is,

156
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:09.630
this is like watching Duran go to the warriors.

157
00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.330
You know the one reason it's over, it's fucking over.

158
00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:17.690
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

159
00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:18.523
<v 0>it's fits. It's over.</v>

160
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:22.260
Watching the Golden State Warriors Win the NBA championship this year was

161
00:10:22.261 --> 00:10:26.880
basically watching like a bad summertime movie. It was big.

162
00:10:26.881 --> 00:10:29.850
It was loud. And you knew how it was going to end and it was, yeah,

163
00:10:29.851 --> 00:10:33.450
it was fucking boring. Right. By the way, congratulations.

164
00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:36.390
I should at least do that. Okay. I mean this fucking, the warriors are amazing.

165
00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:41.660
It's actually bad that Duran joined them as far as like their legacy because you

166
00:10:42.241 --> 00:10:44.760
really had a team that, you know,

167
00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.880
has the already had the potential to be like a dynasty.

168
00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.620
They came within a couple of seconds.

169
00:10:49.621 --> 00:10:52.440
So winning back to back without Duran going there.

170
00:10:52.441 --> 00:10:56.100
So congratulations to the warriors. Congratulations to their fans.

171
00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:01.280
My condolences to any fan of basketball that enjoys competition and enjoys seven

172
00:11:01.321 --> 00:11:02.154
game series.

173
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:08.640
Congratulations to people who want to save the environment and want four people

174
00:11:08.641 --> 00:11:12.450
in a fucking car. The pylon team, that's the basketball team for you.

175
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.640
Cause I just look at it as a metaphor.

176
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:20.490
There wasn't a lack of competition that was a thumbs up for the diamond lane.

177
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:25.470
Let's get all the stars in the same vehicle. All right. Macgregor verse May,

178
00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:30.830
whether this would basically be like if you took Jerry Rice in the prime of his

179
00:11:31.051 --> 00:11:34.470
career, Tom Brady in the prime of his career, and you're like,

180
00:11:34.471 --> 00:11:37.080
let's figure out who's a better football player.

181
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.830
But the only way you are going to measure that it was how far they could throw a

182
00:11:40.831 --> 00:11:44.660
football. You weren't going to do the 40 yard dash.

183
00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:48.960
You won't get to see if they could catch, you know what I mean? I Dunno.

184
00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:52.860
It's just Mayweather boxes.

185
00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:54.160
They're going to have a boxing match.

186
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:58.000
Now you know how fucking over this fight would be if McGregor was allowed to

187
00:11:58.001 --> 00:11:58.834
use,

188
00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:04.650
you know everything else that he does taking it to the ground that kicks the

189
00:12:04.751 --> 00:12:07.710
fucking choke. Choking them out. I'll, I mean, I don't,

190
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.720
I don't know shit about the fight game and I know this is fucking stupid.

191
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.330
This is dumb. Well,

192
00:12:14.331 --> 00:12:16.870
what are you gonna have next to a fucking elephant for us to fucking cheat?

193
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:18.020
And they're gonna have a foot race.

194
00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:23.780
One of the strongest animals ever. One of the fattest animals ever.

195
00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:28.400
Let's have a competition between the two of them based on nothing but speed

196
00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:35.150
dump truck verse Lamborghini. Both forms of transportation.

197
00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:38.690
Yeah. I'll tell you what's going to be,

198
00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:41.840
the only thing that's going to be interesting is if Mayweather can actually

199
00:12:41.841 --> 00:12:46.820
knock him out. He's a 40 year old guy. I know his hands. Uh, you know, he,

200
00:12:46.821 --> 00:12:50.300
I believe he has constant pain in them. Um,

201
00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:53.540
I'm a huge fan of both of them. And uh,

202
00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.960
this is nothing more than a fucking money grab.

203
00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:00.390
This is a smash and fucking grab. This is like, what fucking,

204
00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:05.620
it's like with Bobby Ray. This is like, I put this in the same,

205
00:13:05.621 --> 00:13:10.330
it's a better version of when Bobby Riggs played Billy Jean King or fucking

206
00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:12.840
Muhammad Ali fought ly. Ll Zeto,

207
00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:17.530
how Kogan fought fucking rocky Balboa or whatever the fuck. I mean, this is,

208
00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:20.140
it's, it's in that vein. You know,

209
00:13:20.141 --> 00:13:23.860
I think it's really ironic that the circus just went out of business and now

210
00:13:23.861 --> 00:13:25.090
they're having this pay per view.

211
00:13:25.091 --> 00:13:29.230
I bet the same people who cashed out on the circus, speaking of elephants,

212
00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:33.250
they got their money behind this one. This is not. Um,

213
00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.560
and what's going to be funny is all the mouth breathers,

214
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:39.370
who want to say boxing's a better forum if you know,

215
00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:44.260
when may weather beats fucking McGregor by out pointing him or whatever the fuck

216
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:49.230
he's going to do. Um, everyone's gonna be seek bug bunks.

217
00:13:49.231 --> 00:13:53.080
She's better than MMA. It's gonna be like, dude, he's not doing it.

218
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:56.890
This is like fucking having a breakdancer kick guy battle.

219
00:13:56.891 --> 00:14:00.610
A guy who does nothing but the waltz and we're going to have a waltzing contest.

220
00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:05.860
Not to say that the break dance couldn't figure it out.

221
00:14:05.861 --> 00:14:09.340
He doesn't have enough time. So here's the deal.

222
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.880
I am,

223
00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:14.650
I'm going to say this right now and I probably won't because I'll probably get

224
00:14:14.651 --> 00:14:15.161
sucked into the,

225
00:14:15.161 --> 00:14:18.550
I'm going to do my best to not get into the s to get sucked into the hype of

226
00:14:18.551 --> 00:14:23.410
this fucking fight. All right. I am going to,

227
00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:28.420
uh, I'm going to wait. I'm just gonna I'm setting it up. Okay.

228
00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:30.790
And I'm hoping I'm wrong and I hope people say, Bill,

229
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:33.070
that was the greatest fucking fight I've ever seen in my life.

230
00:14:33.071 --> 00:14:36.040
It went to distance to somehow against all odds,

231
00:14:36.041 --> 00:14:38.680
but Gregor beat Mayweather and then I'll be like, you know what?

232
00:14:38.681 --> 00:14:40.720
Then I'm going to, I'll sit down and I'll fucking watch out. Dude.

233
00:14:40.721 --> 00:14:45.700
I don't give a shit. It's like after you see a movie, when the Oscar, you know,

234
00:14:45.701 --> 00:14:48.130
you kind of know what the movie's about, but you still haven't seen it.

235
00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:49.330
You can go back and watch it. Right.

236
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:54.800
This is the one thing I am really excited about is that McGregor and Mayweather

237
00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:58.550
are going to make a bunch of fucking money. Good for them, good for them.

238
00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:01.430
You know, cause those guys usually end up with their brains all fucked up.

239
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:04.580
You know, they might as well have some money, right. So good for them.

240
00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:07.400
So I'm glad a bunch of people are going to watch that and think that this is

241
00:15:07.401 --> 00:15:09.980
going to be, you know, let's see what's better.

242
00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:13.130
M M A or fucking boxing.

243
00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:16.760
They already decided that way back before Dana white even got into this shit

244
00:15:16.761 --> 00:15:19.700
back when it was, just remember the early days when they didn't,

245
00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:23.420
don't even know what the name of it was. I remember Patrice telling me, dude,

246
00:15:23.421 --> 00:15:27.720
you gotta watch this shit way back in the day when, uh,

247
00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.910
you know that fucking boxer came in wearing one boxing glove.

248
00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:37.940
He fought the other guy and one boxing glove on and the other guy had more of a

249
00:15:37.941 --> 00:15:38.900
wrestling background.

250
00:15:38.901 --> 00:15:41.990
He just put the guy on his back and now he's sitting there with one hand and the

251
00:15:41.991 --> 00:15:45.980
other hands got a mitten on it that's tied to his wrist and he can't get it off.

252
00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:51.380
It was a shit show. So, um, I dunno,

253
00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.780
I dunno. You never know what the fucking happened.

254
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:58.520
You never know what can happen. But, um, I will say this,

255
00:15:58.521 --> 00:16:01.430
I can't put whoever the fuck put that together. Jesus Christ.

256
00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:05.630
I can't imagine the amount of hoops you had to jump through.

257
00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:08.570
Now that I'm getting into producing here and I'm producing a special

258
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:12.410
for Paul [inaudible]. I didn't look at me.

259
00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:14.510
I already feel a little more arrogant.

260
00:16:14.511 --> 00:16:18.950
I me get myself some big fancy Hollywood reading glasses. Those giant wants.

261
00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:22.310
Hey, by the way, what is going on with the world? This fucking guy.

262
00:16:22.311 --> 00:16:25.910
I went to a softball game and shot it up. Now I know it's not John Goodman.

263
00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.580
You know what kind of looks like him? Is it his brother Ron?

264
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:33.630
Is that Ron Goodman? Trump haters. Chutes GOP.

265
00:16:33.631 --> 00:16:38.280
Big GOP. Big Comma. Three others.

266
00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:43.680
Both parties stunned by ball field. Horrible. Yeah, obviously.

267
00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:46.980
Did you need to say that? Oh, as opposed to one of them. Not a dog.

268
00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:51.210
You know when it happened she played softball. Shit like this happens.

269
00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:55.920
Left wing Zealot, whatever that means. Shoots, Republicans

270
00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:59.110
Rep for others. Look at this.

271
00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:03.380
This is what fucking hilarious cause the daily news is, is left leaning,

272
00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:06.560
says Trump hater. They did get that out. This is bold.

273
00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:09.890
They make sure to say both parties as and that's why they did it cause they left

274
00:17:09.891 --> 00:17:11.630
these. And then over here,

275
00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.900
the post who's right-wing as like left wing zealots,

276
00:17:14.901 --> 00:17:18.410
shoots Republican Rep for uh, for others.

277
00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:20.723
<v 4>Um,</v>

278
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:25.830
<v 0>why do you guys think that shit, it keeps happening. I think it's the internet,</v>

279
00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:30.180
you know, and I'm telling you right now, if the shit like this keeps happening,

280
00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.220
if we don't all grow the fuck up,

281
00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:36.030
they're going to take the internet away from us and it probably be a smart

282
00:17:36.031 --> 00:17:39.660
thing. We should go back to just sort of living small lives,

283
00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:43.980
entertaining ourselves, sitting on stoops during hot days, you know,

284
00:17:43.981 --> 00:17:47.130
start making music like your laptop won't work anymore.

285
00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:50.280
That'll be like the modern day washboard I think need to just kind of go back to

286
00:17:50.281 --> 00:17:53.160
that. You know what I use app and people need to go back to playing cards,

287
00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:56.400
playing hearts, Fan Tan, all those old bridge.

288
00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:58.500
I think that that's what needs to happen.

289
00:17:58.501 --> 00:18:03.501
People need to just kind of walk away from social media and all of this shit

290
00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.600
because I think people, I don't know what the deal is. They get,

291
00:18:06.601 --> 00:18:10.350
they get in to fucking what kind of a fucking lunatic.

292
00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:17.940
I mean, what, what was he trying to, I don't even, I don't even like,

293
00:18:17.941 --> 00:18:20.720
I usually avoid those things, but I, you know, I have,

294
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:21.840
I'm doing a talk show today,

295
00:18:21.841 --> 00:18:24.810
so I got to fucking know what's going on in the world. It'd be like,

296
00:18:24.811 --> 00:18:26.940
what's the deal with this or what's the deal with that?

297
00:18:26.941 --> 00:18:29.340
So I figured it'd be the usual. Some politician got cut,

298
00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:34.300
shown his dick of banging a stripper, but now it's just a, it's just a bunch of,

299
00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:38.340
he came and fucking play softball anymore. See,

300
00:18:38.341 --> 00:18:41.370
this is why I don't read the paper just makes you upset. You know what?

301
00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:43.950
Fuck this. I'm going for the bread and circus. I'm going to fucking,

302
00:18:43.951 --> 00:18:48.120
I'm going to get in Greg first Mayweather, you know,

303
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:54.420
then who do I root for? I think I've got a roof for May, whether it be,

304
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:58.400
even though I always go for the underdog, which McGregor has to be considering,

305
00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:02.120
you know, he has this Swiss army knife of Shitty knows how to do it. It's like,

306
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:05.140
no, the only nights you can take out is a,

307
00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:08.510
the one may weather's gonna use and he's been sharpening his for the last

308
00:19:08.511 --> 00:19:13.370
fucking 30, 40 years. He's been boxing his whole life.

309
00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:15.763
<v 4>Um,</v>

310
00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:20.700
<v 0>I will say this though, if McGregor beats may, whether, I mean,</v>

311
00:19:20.701 --> 00:19:21.990
is that the end of boxing?

312
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:28.340
Did I really just say that is well, I'd go, should I be on ESPN right now?

313
00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:32.410
Will this be the end of boxing? Um,

314
00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:38.910
it was already bad when Mayweather and fucking, uh, the Filipino dude,

315
00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:40.390
but the fuck sustained there, you know,

316
00:19:40.391 --> 00:19:42.340
when they should've fought like 30 years earlier,

317
00:19:42.341 --> 00:19:45.940
they finally got around to fighting and then the, the, the,

318
00:19:45.941 --> 00:19:49.390
the Filipino guy who was also like a congressman at that point and like a

319
00:19:49.391 --> 00:19:50.800
karaoke singer, I believe.

320
00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:53.703
<v 4>Um,</v>

321
00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.020
<v 0>he had the got hurt hand when they finally found him.</v>

322
00:19:56.021 --> 00:19:57.470
He just took everybody's fucking money.

323
00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:03.360
How many comedy White Bentley's are you going to buy this guys? You know,

324
00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:04.363
it's some point people.

325
00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.073
<v 4>Um,</v>

326
00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.760
<v 0>anyways, so I'm here in New York and I'm, I'm,</v>

327
00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:15.310
I'm sober William now and I'm, I'm enjoying it.

328
00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:19.840
I really am. I'm getting eight hours fucking sleep, you know, I wake up,

329
00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:24.820
I feel good, the sun's a little brighter. Um,

330
00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:28.060
you know, and it feels good to have it, to have it on me is before, you know,

331
00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:30.970
I used to be like Ad Burj. Um,

332
00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:35.400
so my new thing now is I just meet people and I go to dinner,

333
00:20:35.401 --> 00:20:39.060
I go to fucking lunch with them, you know. So I just met with my,

334
00:20:39.061 --> 00:20:42.300
one of my buddies, uh, that runs the stand over there,

335
00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:44.870
stand comedy club. And uh,

336
00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:48.430
we went over to a diner and I'm sitting there and uh,

337
00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.910
the thing about La is as a bunch of characters in la,

338
00:20:51.911 --> 00:20:55.450
but we're in cars so you don't get to interact with people in New York.

339
00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:57.760
You just walk down the streets, you just get to overhear all this shit.

340
00:20:57.761 --> 00:21:00.250
So I'm sitting there waiting for my buddy to show up and there's this lady,

341
00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:04.870
this lady, all the lady sitting in this booth and she, she, you know,

342
00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:09.360
you know a little kids wave cause it just learning how to use their arm after a

343
00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:11.380
while you get so old you forget how to use it again.

344
00:21:11.381 --> 00:21:13.180
So she's still like a little kid way of like,

345
00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:18.190
it's just like she sort of shaking that limb and her hands just sort of flopping

346
00:21:18.191 --> 00:21:21.730
around as if she has no control over Arista anymore. That old lady wave, right?

347
00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:25.180
So the waiter comes over and says, what's the problem? She's like, yes,

348
00:21:25.181 --> 00:21:28.720
there's something wrong with my coke. And I'm thinking,

349
00:21:28.721 --> 00:21:32.080
okay they brought Pepsi instead of whatever Coca-Cola. She goes,

350
00:21:32.081 --> 00:21:35.860
there's something wrong with my coke. She goes, it's, it's not an a,

351
00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:39.490
can't so you know the way to lie. He goes, all right man, we'll go take care of.

352
00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:44.350
Well we'll fix that for you. Right. And she continues ongoing.

353
00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:46.990
I don't know if I forgot to say it, I probably did,

354
00:21:46.991 --> 00:21:48.430
but it's supposed to be in a can.

355
00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:51.520
So he goes to take her full glass of coke away. And as he takes it away,

356
00:21:51.521 --> 00:21:53.020
she goes, I didn't drink out of it.

357
00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:58.060
Like he was just going to pass it onto the next person that orders a coke,

358
00:21:58.061 --> 00:22:02.110
which was hilarious. So then I'm sitting there with a buddy of mine,

359
00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:07.330
my buddy shows up and as we're talking we were discussing a getting older and he

360
00:22:09.311 --> 00:22:14.050
had some fucking ailment he's been dealing with and that woman shines in,

361
00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:17.080
says she has to say whatever the fuck it was.

362
00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:23.500
Fucking an older person think she shines in that she has the same thing and it

363
00:22:24.221 --> 00:22:26.590
isn't this type, it's that type. And it just,

364
00:22:26.591 --> 00:22:30.310
it felt like I was on a Seinfeld episode. Um,

365
00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:34.120
and then I was just sitting there laughing cause she just kept talking to my

366
00:22:34.121 --> 00:22:37.090
buddy and had to turn around and talk to and I was muttering to him going like,

367
00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:39.280
I want to see how good your wrap it up skills are.

368
00:22:39.281 --> 00:22:41.960
How are you going to get out of this one? And he turned back laughing going,

369
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:44.410
I don't what do we have to change the subject? Cause she kept shining minute.

370
00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:49.180
You have to talk quieter. Is She, can she hear us right now? Um,

371
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:52.990
viral. I thought it was an la guy.

372
00:22:52.991 --> 00:22:56.830
I've just been coming back to New York too much lately and I'm starting to feel

373
00:22:56.831 --> 00:22:58.480
like I want to live back here again,

374
00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:03.910
which is scare me because I have so many friends and a whole life out in la.

375
00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:06.010
But I mean I'm doing emphasis of family so I can't come back.

376
00:23:06.011 --> 00:23:09.670
But I never thought I, I thought I was a lifer out in la,

377
00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:12.970
but I'm coming back here and I'm kinda liking it. So, um,

378
00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:17.470
this is the exact same feeling I used to have when I would go out to la from New

379
00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:20.410
York after I swore I would never live out in la again.

380
00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:23.200
But then I'm also thinking like, Bill,

381
00:23:23.201 --> 00:23:27.310
is this just how you're wired?

382
00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:31.520
Where after a while you just get tired of a fucking place and then you want to,

383
00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:37.430
I don't know. And Man,

384
00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:40.540
oh by the way, a rested piece, Greg Allman,

385
00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:45.560
Jesus Christ, end of an era. The amount of fucking people, by the way,

386
00:23:45.561 --> 00:23:47.600
it's just scare me cause it's just, it's, it's,

387
00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:51.020
it used to be like people that when I was a little kid,

388
00:23:51.021 --> 00:23:54.590
I would watch their shit and they were already old. You know,

389
00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:59.200
when the Bob Hope's the bing Crosby's, the d Martins, the Sammy Davis Juniors,

390
00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:01.550
the Frank Sinatra's, all of them, you know,

391
00:24:01.551 --> 00:24:05.030
all of them we've started passing away, but they were all telly Savalas,

392
00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:10.400
you know, Lee Marvin, Charles Bronson, all of those guys.

393
00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:16.340
Paul Newman, Steve McQueen, all of them. Yule Brenner, Jesus Christ. Bill.

394
00:24:16.341 --> 00:24:19.550
We get it. They were all fucking way before my time.

395
00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:22.490
A lot of them are first generation or they came over, you know,

396
00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:25.250
[inaudible] Bronson came over from Poland.

397
00:24:25.251 --> 00:24:28.520
He worked in like coal mines and Shit. And uh,

398
00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:32.150
but now it's catching up to where the fuck I am.

399
00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:38.360
You know, Batman died. Davy Jones died from one of the monkeys,

400
00:24:38.361 --> 00:24:39.500
right. He died.

401
00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.233
<v 5>Alright.</v>

402
00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:47.740
<v 0>Greg [inaudible] died. George Michael,</v>

403
00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:49.780
it's, it's, it's creeping up,

404
00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:52.303
<v 5>right.</v>

405
00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:55.930
<v 0>It's starting to creep up to like now these are like people who were born, uh,</v>

406
00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:02.030
born in the forties, 50s. A couple people around 1960 I was born in 68 and say,

407
00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:05.930
hey, hey, hey, hey fucking pump the brakes here

408
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:09.590
and this is classic me. Right?

409
00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:15.220
I can still somehow make somebody else's death about myself.

410
00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:18.980
Isn't that nice? All right. So listen to this shit.

411
00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:24.590
I went into fucking guitar center for like the first time in years.

412
00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:29.660
I never go in there, but my wife was around the corner, you know,

413
00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:34.490
taking my lovely daughter to some doctor's appointment. You know,

414
00:25:34.491 --> 00:25:38.150
whenever she goes over there, she, my daughter cries and stuff. I don't like it.

415
00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:42.980
I don't like it. I know she comes out better. I know the doctors amazing.

416
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:46.670
I don't like going over there, you know, you know, I just don't, you know,

417
00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:49.250
you thought to get shots and shit or whatever. By the way,

418
00:25:49.251 --> 00:25:53.330
we did the total immune thing and my daughter's fine by the way.

419
00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.520
We did all of that shit. Thank God.

420
00:25:55.521 --> 00:25:58.250
Cause everyone fucking was scaring the shit out here. Like don't,

421
00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:03.230
don't fucking get them vaccinated for the mumps. That's gonna cause this,

422
00:26:03.231 --> 00:26:04.370
it's going to cause that.

423
00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:09.830
And when I finally did was I realized everybody telling me that none of them

424
00:26:09.831 --> 00:26:14.180
were wearing lab coats and none of them had medical degrees framed pictures

425
00:26:14.181 --> 00:26:18.110
behind me. And I said,

426
00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:21.290
I'm going to roll the dice with the person that went to school for this shit.

427
00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:25.010
And we did. And she's fine. She's totally alert,

428
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:27.830
smiles and all that type of shit. There was nothing bad happened,

429
00:26:27.831 --> 00:26:30.980
thank fucking Christ, but I don't like to be there when that shit goes down.

430
00:26:30.981 --> 00:26:34.610
So I just said, listen, I'm going to fucking, I'll be around the corner,

431
00:26:34.611 --> 00:26:39.220
I'm going to go buy some drumsticks, blah blah blah blah. So I walk into guitars

432
00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:45.600
and I'm there writers, it's 10 minutes before it opens,

433
00:26:45.601 --> 00:26:48.540
it finally opens and I go upstairs to their drum department. You know,

434
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:49.880
cause they always,

435
00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:52.830
always banished drums to the back of the music that they always like,

436
00:26:52.831 --> 00:26:57.210
go fuck yourself. Right. Guitar was the hot chick, you know,

437
00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:01.020
or it sorta used to be. Now I'm finding the electronics, all these dead,

438
00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:04.830
a whole generation of like DJ music and all that shit is like it.

439
00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:06.770
That's becoming, coming up more to the,

440
00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:11.930
the front of the store or becoming a larger surface area of the store,

441
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:17.670
which is another thing, making me feel old. Other than all these people that,

442
00:27:17.671 --> 00:27:20.010
you know, where I remembered, like they were young.

443
00:27:20.011 --> 00:27:22.860
That's what I'm just trying to say. They would like young, when I was young,

444
00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.580
they were like in their twenties and shit and now they've lived a full life and

445
00:27:26.581 --> 00:27:30.120
a dead and like, how the fuck does that happen? It's like, well, Bill,

446
00:27:30.121 --> 00:27:33.870
you're 49 in 20 years you'd be 69, you'd be pushing 70.

447
00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:38.140
It's how fast it fucking goes. So, um,

448
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:43.840
I didn't want to fuck my point was Jesus Christ, am I going to die in this week?

449
00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.850
Um, what's he saying? Oh yeah.

450
00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:52.590
So I go over to the fucking guitar center and uh, I walk in,

451
00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:56.700
so I go upstairs to buy some drum sticks and I'm there so fucking early there's

452
00:27:56.701 --> 00:27:57.780
like nobody there.

453
00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:04.930
So I walk up and I grabbed my drum sticks and I, I always get, you know,

454
00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:09.850
get it five [inaudible] right. And I fucking Mama tried to electronic drum kits.

455
00:28:09.851 --> 00:28:10.331
You know what I mean?

456
00:28:10.331 --> 00:28:13.810
They got that sick ass Roland one that has like literally like a regular

457
00:28:13.811 --> 00:28:17.170
acoustic look and bass drum. I was fucking around on that thing.

458
00:28:17.171 --> 00:28:21.460
That thing's amazing. Hey, oh my God.

459
00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:25.360
If you want to ever feel like you're ready to play a fucking arena,

460
00:28:25.361 --> 00:28:29.110
sit down on one of those fucking Roland kits. And this is not free advertising.

461
00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:33.880
I'm just calling a spade a spade. They're fucking unbelievable. So, um,

462
00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.670
anyways, I'm looking around and I sit behind this one kid and I hit,

463
00:28:38.671 --> 00:28:41.580
go to hit the bass drum and they got this head on it that looks like a regular

464
00:28:41.581 --> 00:28:44.040
head and it barely makes any noise. I'm like, what the fuck is this?

465
00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:48.870
What does this technology, I didn't know this existed. And um,

466
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:50.810
then I was looking at, they had the little quests,

467
00:28:50.811 --> 00:28:53.640
love breakbeat kit and then they had another one,

468
00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:57.780
like an upgraded version of that, which was the, a the sonar kit.

469
00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:01.650
And I was like, Oh fuck, look at these little ass digs.

470
00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:04.620
And then they got these heads that make no fucking noise.

471
00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:06.393
<v 5>Right?</v>

472
00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:11.890
<v 0>What the fuck? So I, I just, I don't know. I just started looking and I'm like,</v>

473
00:29:11.891 --> 00:29:14.710
Father's Day. Father's day is coming up this weekend.

474
00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:20.800
How about happy father's day to me, cause I got one of those, my garage,

475
00:29:20.801 --> 00:29:25.720
I got this DW, like those practice pad kits and those things fucking suck.

476
00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:30.910
You can't get through a song without something fallen off. They just suck.

477
00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:33.610
I fucking hate the thing. All right. I want to get rid of it.

478
00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:34.900
So I'm sitting there going, all right,

479
00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:40.830
I ordered a drum kit and I have a studio space ready to go but didn't realize I

480
00:29:41.981 --> 00:29:44.500
thought I could just go down and get the drum kit, but the color I wanted,

481
00:29:44.501 --> 00:29:46.900
I had to order it and it's not going to be here for fucking two months.

482
00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:49.720
So now what do I do? What do I do in the meantime?

483
00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:51.100
Then suddenly I get this idea go,

484
00:29:51.101 --> 00:29:53.530
I know I'm going to buy one of these little fucking Martini kits here.

485
00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:54.970
All right,

486
00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:59.470
I'll keep the regular heads on and I'll just play in the studio space on the

487
00:29:59.471 --> 00:30:01.900
small kit. And then when my real kid comes,

488
00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:05.460
I'll just get rid of the DW one in my garage and put the silent heads on it and

489
00:30:05.461 --> 00:30:06.580
I can just practice on that one.

490
00:30:06.581 --> 00:30:08.710
I don't have time to drive over to the fucking little studio space.

491
00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:11.530
This is perfect. So then I was like, what do I do? What do I get?

492
00:30:11.531 --> 00:30:16.090
The Ludwig by American Questlove or the sonar kit, Phil Rudd,

493
00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:19.460
AC DC, Steve Smith, right? Benny Gremp,

494
00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:22.900
all these monsters play on these fucking things. And um,

495
00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:27.970
I actually ended up going with the sonar kit. Uh, based on,

496
00:30:27.971 --> 00:30:32.500
was a little bit deeper. The floor time wasn't a 13. It was a 14. And uh,

497
00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:34.590
it was a badass little bebop kind of kit. And I've,

498
00:30:34.591 --> 00:30:39.100
I've gone off the fucking rails listening to jazz dramas.

499
00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:42.610
I never understood it. And now with my great drum teacher and everything,

500
00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:46.390
I'm starting to understand it to the point if I sent you the text messaging that

501
00:30:46.391 --> 00:30:51.370
I had the drum nerd text messaging than I had with um,

502
00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:55.660
my, uh, my drum teacher. Oh, before I say that, by the way,

503
00:30:56.620 --> 00:31:01.240
what is so amazing about getting rid of that John Bonam set up that I had is now

504
00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:04.690
the whole world of what the fuck do I want to play has opened up.

505
00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:09.790
And I don't have any drum kit already taken up space. That was, you know,

506
00:31:09.791 --> 00:31:11.890
somebody else loved and I loved them.

507
00:31:11.891 --> 00:31:14.710
So now I'm going to try to step into their shoes and it never fucking works.

508
00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.270
That is completely gone.

509
00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:20.500
And now I'm just looking at all these different drum set ups going add fucking

510
00:31:20.501 --> 00:31:24.400
like a little bit of that with the little bit of this. It's unreal.

511
00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:27.880
So I buy the thing and you know,

512
00:31:27.881 --> 00:31:31.570
I'm supposed to walk back over to the doctor's office with a pair of drumsticks

513
00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:37.630
and uh, you know, get back in the car with my lovely wife,

514
00:31:37.631 --> 00:31:40.030
my beautiful daughter. But, um,

515
00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:45.100
now I bought a little drum kit, so I got this giant box.

516
00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:48.220
So I just ended up going, all right, fuck this.

517
00:31:48.221 --> 00:31:52.260
I gotta take a picture of the box. I just stood in the back garage. Uh,

518
00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:55.240
they got a parking lot behind the place and I was just like, yeah,

519
00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:57.460
I kind of bought something

520
00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:04.960
and I just took a picture of the box with the sonar and I just wrote happy

521
00:32:04.961 --> 00:32:09.610
father's day to me. The as cool as shit she just wrote.

522
00:32:09.611 --> 00:32:14.200
Oh Jesus, she's so fucking cool. She doesn't give a shit. Right. Um,

523
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:18.340
so she pulled up and then I opened up on my grave. We got the fucking little

524
00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:22.750
hatchback fucking thing here and I opened it up in the goddamn strollers.

525
00:32:22.751 --> 00:32:25.510
And then so I had to move shit around and do all this fucking stuff.

526
00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:30.190
And I got to tell you, I cannot fucking wait.

527
00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:33.700
I'm moving into my a little studio thing tomorrow and I cannot fuck await.

528
00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:37.660
And as I mentioned, I've gone off the rails, listen to these jazz drummers,

529
00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:41.330
and I am now convinced that Tony Williams is the greatest drummer of all time

530
00:32:41.331 --> 00:32:44.630
and it's not even fucking close. I don't want to start a debate. I know.

531
00:32:44.631 --> 00:32:46.610
I just did the fucking guys. Unbelievable.

532
00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:51.110
And I never understood what he was doing other than that he was playing 90

533
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:55.010
million miles an hour on his ride. Simple. So I was listening to this album,

534
00:32:55.600 --> 00:33:00.600
a miles Davis miles smiles and there's this song on there called footprints and

535
00:33:00.831 --> 00:33:03.050
it's one of those things that when I was younger,

536
00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:07.700
meaning like 46 or 47 before he started taking lessons,

537
00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:10.033
um,

538
00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:15.130
it would have just sounded like five guys playing five different songs and that,

539
00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:18.860
that Tony Williams was doing this Keith moons shit underneath it where he was

540
00:33:18.861 --> 00:33:21.860
just soloing or whatever. And I was,

541
00:33:21.861 --> 00:33:25.910
when I first was listening to it, I, I, the only thing I could Kinda,

542
00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:29.600
that was consistent was the baseline. It was his baseline going,

543
00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:32.660
get that gun gun gun, God Duh, Duh, Duh.

544
00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:35.540
And I was just counting that and I'm going, okay, it's since six.

545
00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:40.460
It's in six and it's an, I don't know what Tony's doing and it's,

546
00:33:40.461 --> 00:33:42.620
she's playing 90 mils a million miles an hour.

547
00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:46.190
But what's amazing about the song is in the middle of it,

548
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.530
Tony slows down and it's almost like he's like, okay, stupid.

549
00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:55.550
It's in four. All right, and here's where it is.

550
00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:58.640
Here's where beat two is and here's where beat fours. And then after,

551
00:33:58.641 --> 00:34:01.640
then he only does that for a couple of bars and he speeds up again.

552
00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:05.030
It's like a drum class and it's like, oh my God,

553
00:34:05.031 --> 00:34:09.520
this guy's playing eighth notes. Okay,

554
00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:11.230
against what this guy's playing.

555
00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:14.950
That sounds like it's at six but it's really just almost like three against

556
00:34:14.951 --> 00:34:16.960
four. I know this is nerdy drum shit,

557
00:34:16.961 --> 00:34:18.610
but there's got gotta be a drum out there that understands it.

558
00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:21.160
And then he's doing that metric modulation thing,

559
00:34:21.161 --> 00:34:24.940
which it wasn't even a fucking name for what he was doing to describe it,

560
00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:30.090
where then as he's playing eighth notes that the eighth notes than it,

561
00:34:30.441 --> 00:34:31.530
he implies it that,

562
00:34:31.531 --> 00:34:35.720
that each one of those high hat hits is the two and four and plays the jazz,

563
00:34:36.890 --> 00:34:39.110
that thing. They lean dangling against that.

564
00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:42.100
And then the [inaudible] and the top become the, the,

565
00:34:42.101 --> 00:34:47.101
the fucking one and the three and he's playing that underneath all of this shit.

566
00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:50.091
So the rest of the band,

567
00:34:50.091 --> 00:34:53.390
I guess is sort of playing in an unplugged six while he's playing four

568
00:34:53.391 --> 00:34:56.000
underneath it, doing this metric modulation to the four.

569
00:34:57.230 --> 00:35:02.230
But fucking blows my mind is that he's playing at that fucking level in it.

570
00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:04.040
Roughly the same year.

571
00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:09.520
I was joking with my teachers that that song by the Archie's sugar came out and

572
00:35:09.801 --> 00:35:11.090
was like a number one hit.

573
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:15.110
He's doing that and you know,

574
00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:18.140
they sell like one 90th of the fucking albums

575
00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:21.890
that a song, ah, sugar boom

576
00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:24.130
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

577
00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:25.870
<v 0>a honey honey</v>

578
00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:28.710
<v 7>door to door to two. You</v>

579
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:32.160
<v 0>know, I heard a story about that song that there's a keyboard solo,</v>

580
00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:34.500
which I mean, I don't know shit about music.

581
00:35:34.501 --> 00:35:38.220
I always consider a hacky when you take the soul,

582
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:42.480
when you take it solo and all you do is just play the, the melody of the song.

583
00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:48.330
So that was basically what the studio musician on keys was instructed to do.

584
00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:53.100
So He's reading the sheet music and he was playing the solo to that song.

585
00:35:53.101 --> 00:35:57.360
And evidently he started laughing when he was playing it because it sounded

586
00:35:57.361 --> 00:36:02.040
like, like some five-year-old Shit. But of course that sells a zillion albums.

587
00:36:02.041 --> 00:36:06.450
Which brings me back to the Golden State Warriors. Jay's is,

588
00:36:06.451 --> 00:36:10.740
I'm going along way where people go, yeah, this is bad for basketball.

589
00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:14.760
Why is it getting such high ratings? I'll tell you why.

590
00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:19.770
Because the Archie's outsell miles Davis stay. You go, go fuck yourself.

591
00:36:19.771 --> 00:36:23.250
I'm done talking about the NBA. So anyways, I got a little sonar kit.

592
00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:27.630
I'm so fucking excited to play it. I can't wait. I'm not going to have any time.

593
00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:31.460
I won't have any fucking time to do it. But every once in Awhile, oh,

594
00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:34.470
daddy daycare, you know, my little princess,

595
00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:36.990
that's why I call him my little princess. You know, she got the, you know,

596
00:36:36.991 --> 00:36:40.410
babies have those little cute little fat hands. Every morning I wake up,

597
00:36:40.411 --> 00:36:42.630
I put my little index finger in in her hand, you know,

598
00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:44.880
they always squeeze it and then it bring us, Oh,

599
00:36:44.881 --> 00:36:47.730
good morning princess and I kiss a little full fat baby hand.

600
00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:49.523
<v 4>Okay.</v>

601
00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:53.071
<v 0>You know,</v>

602
00:36:53.071 --> 00:36:56.040
and you wouldn't think that within 20 minutes of that I could get in my car and

603
00:36:56.041 --> 00:36:59.250
have road rage. But I do. You would think at some point I could be like,

604
00:36:59.251 --> 00:37:03.210
you know what, you know, it doesn't get any better than that, but you know, I,

605
00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:06.780
you know, I, I ended up having these fucking problems. Can it ever just, sorry,

606
00:37:06.781 --> 00:37:09.920
just did that with the recording here. I'm on the road. I'm on the road here.

607
00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:13.230
Had to set it down here so I can type in my fucking password. Yeah.

608
00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:16.763
<v 4>Um,</v>

609
00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:20.440
<v 0>but yes, I am on a Tony Williams.</v>

610
00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:24.950
Like I've, I've disappeared down the rat hole,

611
00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:30.790
just it's over. I am completely out there all of these years.

612
00:37:30.791 --> 00:37:32.500
Always loving them but not getting, you know,

613
00:37:32.501 --> 00:37:35.380
I saw him live and I had no idea what the fuck he was doing.

614
00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:39.640
I just knew he was one of the greats and I went to go see him and he had,

615
00:37:39.641 --> 00:37:42.880
you know, he had the yellow grudge kit. I mean this was,

616
00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:48.150
we died 97 I probably saw him in like 92 93 91 somewhere in Boston.

617
00:37:50.501 --> 00:37:54.920
And uh, I mean I was in a room,

618
00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:57.470
they couldn't have been more than like a hundred people there. 8,000 people,

619
00:37:57.471 --> 00:38:00.550
little jazz place. Yeah. And I,

620
00:38:00.551 --> 00:38:04.070
I told you this before and during the break I could, I walked up and I, I,

621
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:09.890
she was looking at his whole setup, you know, we had the black dot heads,

622
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:14.120
the big like, you know, 15 inch high hats and shit.

623
00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:17.900
I saw everybody, I told you, I've told you guys just before I saw Louie Bellson,

624
00:38:17.901 --> 00:38:21.410
he just stood there next to his kid. And you went up and shook his hand.

625
00:38:23.170 --> 00:38:27.070
It was nuts. It's fucking nuts. Um, by the way,

626
00:38:27.071 --> 00:38:31.060
I did an episode of g of Jay Leno's show his car show,

627
00:38:31.061 --> 00:38:34.000
which I didn't know at Jay Leno's garage. I've always been a fan of the website,

628
00:38:34.001 --> 00:38:37.900
but I did an episode of it. Um, I don't know when it's going to be coming out,

629
00:38:37.901 --> 00:38:42.070
but I don't know if this is going to make the cut of, uh,

630
00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:47.800
you know, the final episode of it. But, um, it was weird.

631
00:38:47.801 --> 00:38:50.620
I was going to be doing his show and I was reading all this Tony Williams,

632
00:38:50.621 --> 00:38:55.120
miles Davis Shit. And I learned about this jazz club, um,

633
00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:58.900
in Peabody, Massachusetts. That's no longer there.

634
00:38:58.901 --> 00:39:00.820
It was called Lenny's on the turnpike.

635
00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:04.390
It was this little hole in the wall and all these guys used to play there.

636
00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:10.210
And um, so then I be, I don't know,

637
00:39:10.211 --> 00:39:13.600
I was reading about miles and it said he had a gig there and I was like,

638
00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:16.000
PBD Massachusetts, Jesus Christ. I know where that is.

639
00:39:16.001 --> 00:39:18.430
So then I started reading about the jazz club. That's what it was.

640
00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:21.550
And then I found out that Jay Leno used to open for the, you know,

641
00:39:21.551 --> 00:39:25.540
used to play there. So then, but holy shit, I'm, I'm working with him in a week.

642
00:39:25.541 --> 00:39:26.141
I gotta ask him.

643
00:39:26.141 --> 00:39:30.400
So I asked him about it and he talked about fucking opening for miles Davis

644
00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:32.100
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

645
00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:34.350
<v 0>at Lenny's on the turnpike. I said, Holy Shit,</v>

646
00:39:34.351 --> 00:39:39.240
what was it like to meet that guy goes, you know, it goes a,

647
00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:43.020
he was kind of distant and I go, really? And he was kind, Kinda, you know,

648
00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:47.940
I mean, the guy obviously had a reputation for being a little bit moody,

649
00:39:47.941 --> 00:39:52.590
but he was also a said, this is what he said. He goes through it,

650
00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:54.030
you've got to understand this was,

651
00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:58.080
it was Boston in the early seventies as bad as Boston is now.

652
00:39:58.081 --> 00:40:00.690
It was like a thousand times even more racist back then.

653
00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:04.050
And he was a black guy driving around in a Ferrari and used to get pulled over

654
00:40:04.051 --> 00:40:09.030
like every five feet. So he said, Jay was saying that, you know, when a,

655
00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:14.480
basically by the time he met Jay, he kinda had his fill of white people.

656
00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:15.813
<v 8>That's a fact that,</v>

657
00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:20.590
<v 0>so anyways, um,</v>

658
00:40:21.370 --> 00:40:23.570
let me read some advertising here this week. Uh,

659
00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:25.960
and if anybody else knows any like, uh,

660
00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:31.180
cool shit from that fucking era for me to listen to. Um,

661
00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:37.790
I mean it just fascinates me how like jazz was like the main stream and that

662
00:40:37.791 --> 00:40:39.860
blues and R and B and then you know,

663
00:40:39.861 --> 00:40:44.270
white people turn it into rock and roll or whatever that that ended up taking

664
00:40:44.271 --> 00:40:46.490
over and it's just like, yeah,

665
00:40:46.491 --> 00:40:49.850
what was gonna because it's the direction of jazz just kept growing and growing,

666
00:40:49.851 --> 00:40:53.240
growing to the point. That shit that I was just explaining to you guys,

667
00:40:53.241 --> 00:40:56.030
it took me 30 years to understand what the fuck was going on.

668
00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:59.900
Just as a regular person, you're going to lose the mainstream at that point,

669
00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:03.380
but you got to give it up to those guys for having the balls to just say, yeah,

670
00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:05.260
we'll fuck it. This is the direction we're going in.

671
00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:07.633
<v 8>Um,</v>

672
00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:10.580
<v 0>they have to be like the level that they were playing.</v>

673
00:41:10.581 --> 00:41:13.730
They had to know that half the fucking audience had no idea what was going on.

674
00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:17.840
Or you would just play it into a whole crowd full of musicians. Right. I know.

675
00:41:17.841 --> 00:41:20.980
I'm in way over my head. Who the fuck am I? Who am I? And I just, I'm just,

676
00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:24.890
the community does a fucking podcast here. Alright, let's a Jesus,

677
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.910
we've got a couple of reads here. Um, all right.

You gotta be fucking kidding me.

680
00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:42.090
This is how low on the totem pole men are. There they are.

681
00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:45.720
They're already advertising mother's Day. It's around the corner.

682
00:41:45.721 --> 00:41:49.970
It's fucking 11 months away. I'm fucking with the, you know,

683
00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:52.790
obviously what they did, they forgot to put father's day in there.

684
00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:56.330
Who gives a shit? It should dead. Go get him. Get him a belt.

685
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:57.650
Give him something else to beat you with.

<v 0>In order to successfully run your own business,</v>

752
00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:00.530
attention to detail is so critical.

753
00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:06.370
One contract slip up or legal misunderstanding can really set you back.

754
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:11.000
What do you mean we're broke? Fortunately, there is legal zone.

755
00:46:12.110 --> 00:46:15.230
You may already know that over half a million. Over a million. Sorry.

756
00:46:15.231 --> 00:46:20.231
Americans have used legal zoom to stat their own business by legal zoom services

757
00:46:20.751 --> 00:46:24.980
go well beyond business formation. They'll help you hide a body.

758
00:46:25.310 --> 00:46:29.330
They built a nationwide network of independent attorneys who can provide legal

759
00:46:29.331 --> 00:46:33.240
answers to the day to day questions you have about your business. Uh,

760
00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:36.500
because let's face it, things like trademarks,

761
00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:40.610
employer employment laws and lease agreements can get pretty complicated.

762
00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:43.880
That's such a nice way of saying, let's face it, you're fucking dope.

763
00:46:43.881 --> 00:46:46.850
You don't wanna deal with this. You know what I am and I'm proud of it.

764
00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:50.510
So don't waste your valuable time trying to wrap your head around all the fine

765
00:46:50.511 --> 00:46:54.170
print. That's true. All successful people, you know what they do? They delegate,

766
00:46:54.171 --> 00:46:59.120
they delegate the delegate. I'm not good at this shit. Hey you Myron,

767
00:46:59.150 --> 00:47:02.240
put the glasses, you're good with numbers, aren't you? Because you are.

768
00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:05.410
Here's a pencil. Figure this shit up. Um,

769
00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:08.510
so don't waste your valuable time trying to wrap your head around all the fine

770
00:47:08.511 --> 00:47:12.560
print. Use Legal Zoom for that so you can focus on growing your business.

771
00:47:12.561 --> 00:47:16.040
Instead, you'll get the legal help you need without being billed by the hours.

772
00:47:16.041 --> 00:47:17.720

775
00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:30.220
Mercifully my reading out loud over, you know,

776
00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:35.250
last week I might have somehow doing an hour on having such a good fucking time

777
00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:37.930
here. All right, well I gotta read this thing and then I'm out of here.

778
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:42.160
All right. Last week. Our Monday, I should say, I read this,

779
00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:46.820
we had the heading to an email question and we did not have the email and with

780
00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:51.910
this apologizes profusely and I had to stop him from committing. Harry Carey.

781
00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:56.860
Alright, lady needing advice. Don't want to go to male's friend's wedding.

782
00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:58.150
Hey Bill,

783
00:47:58.150 --> 00:48:03.150
I really enjoy the advice portion of your podcast and could use an objective

784
00:48:03.611 --> 00:48:04.444
opinion.

785
00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:09.480
I am a lady and have a male friend that I've been friends with since I was 10

786
00:48:12.461 --> 00:48:15.370
years old. I am now 29.

787
00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:19.690
You know what guys, I got to apologize something. I have this great bit.

788
00:48:19.691 --> 00:48:24.691
I can't wait to try out tomorrow night and I literally was thinking about the

789
00:48:25.451 --> 00:48:29.170
joke I wanted to do and how far I was going to take it while I read all of that.

790
00:48:29.171 --> 00:48:31.000
So I have no idea what's going on in this email.

791
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.230
If just please forgive me as I reread this. Uh,

792
00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:39.160
I am a lady and have a male friend that I had been friends with.

793
00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:40.300
Well you just said you were friends.

794
00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:43.480
I have a male friend that had been enemies with.

795
00:48:43.481 --> 00:48:46.210
I have a male friend that I'd been friends with since I was 10 years old.

796
00:48:46.211 --> 00:48:50.640
I'm 29 now cause he'd been friends with this guy for 19 years now. Geez.

797
00:48:50.650 --> 00:48:52.900
Did he think of being, you predict in the seventh grade?

798
00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:57.370
My friend is with this girl that I've never warmed up to.

799
00:48:57.820 --> 00:49:01.150
She's a bit now wait a minute. Did you always think he was going to ask you?

800
00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:04.210
Is that what it is? Maybe they're not built.

801
00:49:04.211 --> 00:49:06.400
Why don't you just read the fucking thing? She's a bit condescending,

802
00:49:06.401 --> 00:49:08.860
phony and I just don't like her. He's,

803
00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:12.770
he's in his early thirties she's 25 ah, so she's got,

804
00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:17.800
she on the old odometer there and they both currently live with his mom who also

805
00:49:17.801 --> 00:49:20.980
happens to be a good friend of mine. They have crappy jobs,

806
00:49:20.981 --> 00:49:23.710
don't pay his mom rent or contribute much,

807
00:49:24.010 --> 00:49:29.010
but instead they're putting money back to have a wedding by the end of the year.

808
00:49:30.610 --> 00:49:31.630
I love my friend,

809
00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:36.220
but he's always been a bit immature when it comes to money responsibilities.

810
00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:40.380
Why are you still hanging out with these people that you've,

811
00:49:40.550 --> 00:49:44.500
these people sound like fucking losers. Walk away.

812
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:48.640
Be Thankful you didn't hit your wagon to this shit. I can tell you right now,

813
00:49:48.730 --> 00:49:51.610
if you are with this guy and you were living in his mom's house,

814
00:49:51.611 --> 00:49:53.720
you would not be friends with his mom anymore. You'd be like,

815
00:49:53.721 --> 00:49:56.500
I got to get the fuck outta here. Anyways. They, they're not,

816
00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:57.790
they're immature when it comes to money,

817
00:49:57.791 --> 00:49:59.980
responsibility or what it takes to be an adult.

818
00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:04.450
He still depends on his mom a lot. He's 32.

819
00:50:04.451 --> 00:50:08.560
This is pathetic. I don't hear it. Dad, in this scenario here,

820
00:50:08.690 --> 00:50:10.570
what did he not have a dad? He didn't learn how to be a mom.

821
00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:15.520
A be a managed at say a mom. Uh, when my grandmother recently died,

822
00:50:15.521 --> 00:50:18.670
I was devastated and he asked me for my, my address.

823
00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:23.020
I thought I would get a sympathy card, but instead I got a save the date card.

824
00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:29.510
Oh my God. That's sad and fucking hilarious.

825
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:34.750
It pisses me off that he's a bit of a selfish prick in his own world and also a

826
00:50:34.851 --> 00:50:39.290
dumb ass for being in such a rush to get married when neither one of them has

827
00:50:39.291 --> 00:50:41.450
their shit together. It's difficult for them,

828
00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:43.200
<v 10>me</v>

829
00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:48.200
<v 0>to be supportive before you assume I'm secretly in love with him,</v>

830
00:50:48.241 --> 00:50:49.680
which I did. I'm sorry.

831
00:50:49.950 --> 00:50:54.720
Our friendship has been nothing but platonic and I recently got married myself.

832
00:50:55.590 --> 00:50:58.260
I'm sorry, but this whole thing read like when Harry met Sally,

833
00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:02.160
except Perry never moved out. Um, I don't want to get,

834
00:51:02.370 --> 00:51:04.350
I don't want to go to their wedding. My question is,

835
00:51:04.351 --> 00:51:08.670
do you think I should put my show side and try to be supportive of my friends

836
00:51:08.671 --> 00:51:09.630
since he's happy?

837
00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:13.680
I feel as though our friendship has shifted a ton since he's been with this girl

838
00:51:13.890 --> 00:51:17.700
and it's no longer easy talking to him. This is what she'd do.

839
00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:21.420
You go to the wedding and then you just gradually back away.

840
00:51:21.450 --> 00:51:24.960
You've outgrown these people. Okay. That's it. You're married.

841
00:51:24.970 --> 00:51:28.560
You have your own fucking life. If he wants to live in a home with his mother,

842
00:51:29.310 --> 00:51:31.980
with his new wife, and whatever the fuck it is is going to do.

843
00:51:31.981 --> 00:51:35.820
You just go there and just to having nice smile on your face,

844
00:51:35.821 --> 00:51:39.780
just being happy that you're not the on the other side of the I do. Okay.

845
00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:41.850
I'm still not 100%,

846
00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:45.233
<v 4>um,</v>

847
00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:50.220
<v 0>buying the fact that you don't have some sort of feelings for this kid who's now</v>

848
00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:53.640
still acting like a kid in his thirties. You're 29. He's 32.

849
00:51:53.641 --> 00:51:56.160
We use three years older. You probably said this is perfect.

850
00:51:56.690 --> 00:51:59.310
Then you envision him wearing a suit and coming home,

851
00:51:59.311 --> 00:52:03.030
bringing like Hugh Beaumont at the beginning of leave it to beaver with a higher

852
00:52:03.031 --> 00:52:07.080
end fucking GM product, Oldsmobile,

853
00:52:07.081 --> 00:52:09.180
possibly a Buick. Who knows?

854
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:13.180
<v 4>Um, I don't know,</v>

855
00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:16.820
<v 0>but this is what I would do. You've got to let it go. It wasn't meant to be.</v>

856
00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:19.880
Okay. And even if you don't have romantic,

857
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.823
<v 4>um,</v>

858
00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:25.640
<v 0>feelings for this person, all right?</v>

859
00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:27.740
If you don't have feelings for this fucking person,

860
00:52:28.370 --> 00:52:31.580
I can already tell you the fact that it's so driving you nuts that you had to

861
00:52:31.581 --> 00:52:35.660
write into some dope like me doing a podcast. Um,

862
00:52:36.050 --> 00:52:37.700
I dunno the way, the way this is all written.

863
00:52:37.701 --> 00:52:40.910
I think you wear your feelings on your sleeve and they're gonna know it's up.

864
00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:44.450
I would go there, you know, smile and wave. That's it.

865
00:52:44.451 --> 00:52:48.560
And then I would not torture your husband on the way home or the whole night

866
00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:50.960
critiquing them about how fucking stupid it is,

867
00:52:50.961 --> 00:52:52.220
because they can tell you this right now.

868
00:52:52.221 --> 00:52:55.610
Your husband doesn't want to fucking go. So it's, you should go.

869
00:52:55.790 --> 00:52:59.180
You should do is you should go there and you should have a great fucking time

870
00:52:59.181 --> 00:53:02.930
with your husband and you should thank him for not being a fucking loser that

871
00:53:02.931 --> 00:53:05.660
lives at home with his mom. They have golf. All right.

872
00:53:05.661 --> 00:53:07.040
And then go to frame bridge.

873
00:53:07.310 --> 00:53:11.600
Take a picture your tetes and give it to them on Sunday. That's the podcast.

874
00:53:11.601 --> 00:53:12.434
Everybody.

875
00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:22.030
God bless all of you. God bless America. Uh,

876
00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:23.960
that's it. Get off the Internet.

877
00:53:24.110 --> 00:53:26.880
Go sit on the stupid go make some music with your friends.

878
00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:31.880
Stop taking life so fucking seriously. Uh, stay away from credit cards.

879
00:53:31.881 --> 00:53:33.810
Stay away from the meth. Uh,

880
00:53:33.890 --> 00:53:37.830
doctor prescribes any painkillers that has any opiates in it. Do not take them.

881
00:53:37.831 --> 00:53:42.000
Tough it out. Just watch. There will be blood. Did she sit down on the couch?

882
00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:43.590
[inaudible] toughing it out.

883
00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:47.100
Fucking guy dragged himself out of the fucking Wiley. Coyote.

884
00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:50.730
Mine with a broken leg that go in town just to get a fucking gold nickel.

885
00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:54.870
All right, you can do it. All right. That's the podcast. Have a great weekend.

886
00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:56.490
Your constant. I'll talk to you on Monday.

887
00:53:58.030 --> 00:54:01.780
<v 11>Alright. Overrated a relationships. Do I really want to read this one with you?</v>

888
00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:02.793
Is here.

889
00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:07.630
Can you come near the microphone and be a frigging professional when this

890
00:54:07.631 --> 00:54:09.770
unprofessional show? No, you're just sitting.

891
00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:14.440
Why are you wearing moccasins? They're my slippers.

892
00:54:14.650 --> 00:54:16.780
Their moccasins? Yeah. MOCCASINS slip.

893
00:54:18.250 --> 00:54:18.890
<v 0>Woo. Hi.</v>

894
00:54:18.890 --> 00:54:22.380
<v 11>Yo. Hey. Hey. Uh, you got a little Indian blood in your [inaudible]. Yes. Yes.</v>

895
00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:26.620
Do I have like one? Let me [inaudible] 16th. What do you got? Black feet. Yeah,

896
00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:31.330
you get it? Nothing.

897
00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:36.070
I get nothing on that. That was stupid. You know what? What?

898
00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:40.540
Oh, go fuck yourself. Here we go. Relationships. So, uh,

899
00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:43.390
sure that could be good. But are they ever great?

900
00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:49.510
Every married guy I know reminisces about his days as a single man,

901
00:54:49.810 --> 00:54:53.080
married guys, worn single guys not to get into relationships.

902
00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:57.340
They warn guys with girlfriends to never under any circumstances get married.

903
00:54:57.341 --> 00:55:00.520
This is all true. When you're single, you could do whatever the fuck you want.

904
00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.940
Whatever you want without first, uh, wait a minute.

905
00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:07.960
Let me get this closer without first filtering your decisions through the

906
00:55:07.961 --> 00:55:11.710
desires of a chick who probably doesn't even know what she wants most of the

907
00:55:11.711 --> 00:55:15.820
time and is motivated by the worldview of sex in the city. Wow.

908
00:55:15.821 --> 00:55:19.630
This person sounds like a real prize. Yeah, but this is true though.

909
00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:22.780
This is an all women. A lot of women have fucking idiots. Just like, guys,

910
00:55:23.130 --> 00:55:25.450
what'd you say? Most guys are fucking idiots. I would actually,

911
00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:30.370
and aren't most women, aren't most people fucking idiots. Listen,

912
00:55:30.371 --> 00:55:32.350
we're all ray people, but when we talk,

913
00:55:34.270 --> 00:55:37.810
all I know is that no one is unreasonable. Okay?

914
00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:40.780
And I am as exotic as a grilled cheese sandwich.

915
00:55:42.970 --> 00:55:45.880
I think that might be an instant classic. Um,

916
00:55:46.270 --> 00:55:49.190
there wasn't even tomato in that sandwich was there. Um,

917
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:52.540
even when the chicks get, uh, what they think they want that you,

918
00:55:52.590 --> 00:55:55.930
they're usually still miserable. That's how stupid most of them are.

919
00:55:55.931 --> 00:55:58.750
All right now. Yeah. Now he's thanksgiving. This isn't my school.

920
00:55:58.990 --> 00:56:02.230
He's in my quad. I like this guy. Uh, you're never gonna make them happy.

921
00:56:02.231 --> 00:56:03.160
So why even try?

922
00:56:04.450 --> 00:56:07.300
I'm not being constrained by relationship is one of the greatest things of all

923
00:56:07.301 --> 00:56:11.080
time. It's a man's world. Uh, women need more.

924
00:56:11.590 --> 00:56:14.440
Women need men more than men need women.

925
00:56:14.620 --> 00:56:18.280
Most men can thrive alone. Most women can. These young,

926
00:56:18.310 --> 00:56:19.660
you could tell he's young. He hasn't,

927
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:23.650
he hasn't like women are still looking at him. He's a fucking idiot. What he is.

928
00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:26.320
Oh yes. And he's learning. I was this guy.

929
00:56:26.790 --> 00:56:29.950
Then you realize at some point you're old and women don't care anymore,

930
00:56:29.951 --> 00:56:34.330
so you got to grab one on. Just hang onto them, drag them down with you. Um,

931
00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:39.600
most women can't ask any honest bisexual girl and she'll like you tell you that

932
00:56:39.851 --> 00:56:42.670
she wants to end up with a man. Jesus,

933
00:56:42.671 --> 00:56:45.250
this guy just keeps every time I think he's gone as far as he's going to go,

934
00:56:45.251 --> 00:56:49.300
he keeps going. I love him. Uh, enjoy being single.

935
00:56:49.390 --> 00:56:51.670
Unless you're a total fucking failure of a man,

936
00:56:51.970 --> 00:56:54.880
you almost always be able to get a girlfriend if you really want one.

937
00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:57.870
Realize yeah, if you're past a certain age too,

938
00:56:58.030 --> 00:57:02.020
there's a certain amount of money you have to be making a bef for that to

939
00:57:02.021 --> 00:57:02.950
continue to happen.

940
00:57:03.010 --> 00:57:08.010
And this is a fucking sadness to that life that I can't even begin to describe a

941
00:57:09.010 --> 00:57:12.730
, realize what a blessing your freedom is and never allow desperation to put you

942
00:57:12.731 --> 00:57:14.830
in chains. He's making some good points here.

943
00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:19.900
He definitely has some issues with women, but uh, he's, but he's,

944
00:57:19.901 --> 00:57:23.340
there's a lot of truth in that. Nia, they're all and enjoy dying alone. Asshole.

945
00:57:23.550 --> 00:57:26.490
Hey, hey. Hey. Well listen what this is.

946
00:57:26.660 --> 00:57:29.960
Well basically what you just said was that you're a dumb girl. Why?

947
00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:31.470
Because that's what he was attacking.

948
00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:35.130
What do you mean is your world is your world? Oh,

949
00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:38.370
we will almost out without an argument, but why am I dumb?

950
00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:42.270
Because he's attacking women whose worldview comes from sex in the city. Okay,

951
00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:45.060
so somehow you got offended by that. First of all,

952
00:57:45.061 --> 00:57:48.180
he's not just attacking women whose worldview at sex? Nothing. He's, Oh,

953
00:57:48.181 --> 00:57:52.350
I think he is. He's attacking all women. Look at Reed. Say, Oh, I know.

954
00:57:52.351 --> 00:57:57.030
He was just being say some women. He was just being silly. Just being silly. Oh,

955
00:57:57.031 --> 00:58:00.480
you're right. You're right. Fuck that shit. Fuck it. Look, you know, look,

956
00:58:00.481 --> 00:58:05.250
you know his mother never hugged him. He's got issues. He's just not our fault.

957
00:58:05.390 --> 00:58:09.030
What are we doing? Don't drag me into this. I relate to this guy as women.

958
00:58:09.031 --> 00:58:11.820
I'm speaking as women. Well, why don't you just speak for yourself?

959
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:15.210
You fucking delusional. Jacquez who elected you? You did.

960
00:58:15.211 --> 00:58:16.860
I'm sitting there and I want it. You know,

961
00:58:16.861 --> 00:58:20.460
I didn't say to represent all women's. I'm not representing all women's,

962
00:58:20.461 --> 00:58:21.860
but I think I can say with,

963
00:58:22.430 --> 00:58:27.430
with underwear's clarity that most smart women who see this would be like,

964
00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:30.690
oh fuck yourself. You'd Douche. All right, well I'll, I'll,

965
00:58:30.691 --> 00:58:33.810
can I just make a comment about the whole married versus unmarried thing?

966
00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:36.090
The grass is always greener on the other side.

967
00:58:36.210 --> 00:58:40.010
Single people who are alone look at couples and I, I,

968
00:58:40.011 --> 00:58:42.210
they get a little twinge of like, oh, that's nice.

969
00:58:42.210 --> 00:58:45.930
I wish I had somebody to come home to at night that has my back. No matter what.

970
00:58:46.050 --> 00:58:48.840
That's what you're missing. You shortsighted moron.

971
00:58:49.170 --> 00:58:51.360
It's like you've got somebody hey there with you,

972
00:58:51.361 --> 00:58:52.560
who's going to take care of you,

973
00:58:52.561 --> 00:58:55.800
who's going to love you and protect you and have your back.

974
00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:59.550
It's not just about like being with someone just to be with someone.

975
00:59:00.990 --> 00:59:02.100
We got it.

976
00:59:02.220 --> 00:59:07.210
Listen how you look onto can I want to, cause you're,

977
00:59:07.211 --> 00:59:11.490
you're being mean. This podcast, this podcast email is ridiculous.

978
00:59:11.491 --> 00:59:16.290
Guys crying out for help. Ugh, whatever. Fine.

979
00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:20.430
Go on. This podcast is not about being mean and taking shots of people who can't

980
00:59:20.431 --> 00:59:23.420
defend. That's exactly what it was.

981
00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:29.260
Took you long enough to figure that out. Um, alright. No. But there's, there's,

982
00:59:29.261 --> 00:59:33.030
there's a great truth in what he's saying here is a lot of people just jumping

983
00:59:33.070 --> 00:59:34.240
relationship, jumping relationship,

984
00:59:34.241 --> 00:59:39.220
jumping relationship and it's like relationships a fucking difficult.

985
00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:40.181
Yes. Okay,

986
00:59:40.181 --> 00:59:43.450
so you better pick the right person or you're going to be fucking miserable.

987
00:59:43.570 --> 00:59:48.570
So you are better off to be single and lonely rather than just being in some

988
00:59:48.581 --> 00:59:52.710
shit to just be in some shit. So you got somebody to fucking make brownies with.

989
00:59:53.350 --> 00:59:56.150
That's what he was trying to say. Yes. All right, true. But he didn't say that.

990
00:59:56.151 --> 01:00:00.470
He ended up saying that most cigs are going to be miserable anyway and they all

991
01:00:00.471 --> 01:00:02.960
have the stupid worldview. That's true. Father,

992
01:00:03.050 --> 01:00:06.200
most women are going to be miserable and then never going to be fucking happy.

993
01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:07.610
Okay. You basing this on,

994
01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:10.370
you know something you guys always say a good man is hard to find.

995
01:00:10.371 --> 01:00:13.070
That works both fucking ways. I understand. Well then that's,

996
01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:15.860
this is what bolt wealth. This motherfucker hasn't found the one yet.

997
01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:17.270
So he's going and he's going,

998
01:00:17.271 --> 01:00:21.200
he's dating a bunch of lashing out at everybody because he can't seem to figure

999
01:00:21.201 --> 01:00:22.700
out how to make a relationship work.

1000
01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:24.620
And he can't find the value in the relationship.

1001
01:00:24.850 --> 01:00:27.480
So automatically it's not valuable. First of all,

1002
01:00:27.550 --> 01:00:31.790
the only person lashing out is you right now. Lost your temper.

1003
01:00:32.210 --> 01:00:34.040
It's a guy here. He writes in,

1004
01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:36.290
he's looking for a little bit of God damn guidance.

1005
01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:39.380
He wants somebody to advice approval. That's what he got it.

1006
01:00:39.381 --> 01:00:41.450
He's fucking hilarious. Um,

1007
01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:47.740
um, underrated. Overrated, underrated for this week. Uh, overrated.

1008
01:00:47.741 --> 01:00:51.340
Fucking voicemails. Leaving them is the most awkward thing.

1009
01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:55.510
I've always said that I'm terrible at leaving them. But whenever I say that,

1010
01:00:55.511 --> 01:00:59.320
everyone else, whenever I say that, everyone else always says it too.

1011
01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:02.710
So I'm putting my foot down on the issue and calling it right now,

1012
01:01:02.711 --> 01:01:05.290
leaving a message for someone on the phone sucks.

1013
01:01:05.590 --> 01:01:09.250
There's no way to start your message normally without sounding like a Douche.

1014
01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:12.430
And then five minutes later you realize you've been trailing on and on while

1015
01:01:12.431 --> 01:01:16.690
saying, uh, um, too many times making you want to kill yourself,

1016
01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:19.630
ending with the inevitable. Uh, okay, thanks.

1017
01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:23.680
By reminding them that you're still a Douche. Fucking awful.

1018
01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:28.280
Do this is something that's really like an epidemic in this young generations.

1019
01:01:28.330 --> 01:01:31.720
Is everybody just feeling awkward and feeling like a Douche?

1020
01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:36.730
I don't know what happened to you guys. I think this last generation of fathers,

1021
01:01:36.731 --> 01:01:39.430
they flipped. Like, I'm not going to beat the shit out of my kid,

1022
01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:44.710
not hug them and never tell him that I, that I, that I love, uh, you know,

1023
01:01:44.711 --> 01:01:47.770
I'm going to do all of that shit and you end up with these people who can't even

1024
01:01:47.771 --> 01:01:50.170
fucking leave voicemails.

1025
01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:54.490
What is so awkward? You know,

1026
01:01:57.420 --> 01:02:00.040
I, I, you know, I have a hard time getting off the phone. I forget.

1027
01:02:00.070 --> 01:02:03.870
I forget what I used to say, but I don't feel awkward,

1028
01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:10.070
but I just feel like an idiot, I guess. So I guess I kind of relate. I just go,

1029
01:02:10.071 --> 01:02:13.320
I that's it. I'm Outta here. Okay.

1030
01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:18.890
I will say that believe in a message. I like leaving messages.

1031
01:02:18.891 --> 01:02:22.650
I sing on people's voicemails. You know,

1032
01:02:22.651 --> 01:02:26.340
whenever I call up fucking Blob, hey Bobby Kelly,

1033
01:02:27.690 --> 01:02:32.190
or in fucking Joey roses, I call him up and I,

1034
01:02:32.191 --> 01:02:34.500
I'll just immediately, I'll just, whatever comes to my mind,

1035
01:02:34.501 --> 01:02:38.850
I'll just start singing. Who's the can't that I loved the most?

1036
01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:43.740
Who's that fucker? Who eats the toasted Joey?

1037
01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:48.930
He such a big fag to Rosa. What's going on?

1038
01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:53.250
It's bill. Give me a call back. You can't click. That's it.

1039
01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:56.600
Why don't you try singing? You can do it for anybody.

1040
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.980
Hey Mom, what's up you sweetie? Thanks for having me.

1041
01:03:02.981 --> 01:03:07.570
40 years ago I sent you some flowers.

1042
01:03:07.571 --> 01:03:08.860
You didn't call me.

1043
01:03:09.730 --> 01:03:13.180
Do you like my siblings better than me?

1044
01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:17.330
Click right? Why don't you do that? Try that search.

1045
01:03:17.331 --> 01:03:21.070
Try singing first. Um, all right. Underrated. Overrated. Underrated.

1046
01:03:21.071 --> 01:03:24.910
Sitting Down to pee. If you're a guy. Uh,

1047
01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:34.000
okay. Is it that? How old are you? Is it that hard to stand up?

1048
01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:39.930
What is wrong with this fucking generation of guys? You Know,

1049
01:03:39.931 --> 01:03:41.130
Sitting Down To pee,

1050
01:03:41.131 --> 01:03:45.030
it's actually easier and you don't get varicose veins from all those years of

1051
01:03:45.330 --> 01:03:45.630
staring.

1052
01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:50.370
There's nothing better than just pulling out your Dick and just fucking pee and

1053
01:03:50.371 --> 01:03:55.230
all over everything. You know, he's fucking shooting the toilet paper around.

1054
01:03:55.231 --> 01:03:58.740
It's fucking good time. Um, anyways,

1055
01:03:59.230 --> 01:04:01.890
it's just the guy who drives a fucking hybrid. Um, anyways,

1056
01:04:01.891 --> 01:04:03.660
there are many benefits to being a guy in,

1057
01:04:03.661 --> 01:04:07.830
sitting down to piece such as not having to hear your chick complain about

1058
01:04:07.831 --> 01:04:09.060
peeing on the seat,

1059
01:04:09.090 --> 01:04:14.090
even though it's on the fucking top of the ball and it's not actually the seat.

1060
01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:17.750
Yeah. Here's a guy, he's, he,

1061
01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:22.610
he's literally sitting down to pee, so his girlfriend will stop yelling at him.

1062
01:04:23.810 --> 01:04:26.420
Okay. I don't know what happened.

1063
01:04:26.421 --> 01:04:28.990
People a hundred years ago,

1064
01:04:28.991 --> 01:04:31.810
we could hit them with mop handles and I don't know what happened.

1065
01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:33.340
They got organized and we didn't,

1066
01:04:33.341 --> 01:04:37.300
and now we're sitting down to pee just so they'll stop yelling at us.

1067
01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:40.210
Um, all right, number two, if you like me,

1068
01:04:40.211 --> 01:04:42.610
if you're like me and you wake up to pee at night,

1069
01:04:42.611 --> 01:04:46.900
you don't have to fuck with your eyes and turn on the bathroom lights to aim.

1070
01:04:48.550 --> 01:04:50.110
Oh Dude. You take it all the fun out of it.

1071
01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:57.550
So you train your ear. All right, that sounds like the back of the bowl.

1072
01:04:58.630 --> 01:05:02.440
Where's the water? That's the floor. There it is.

1073
01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:06.850
One small step. Um, number three,

1074
01:05:06.851 --> 01:05:09.820
not bending down to lift up the seat out. You know what dude?

1075
01:05:09.821 --> 01:05:13.930
You're a fucking pansy. Not Bending down to clean off the seat.

1076
01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:15.610
Less bending in general.

1077
01:05:15.611 --> 01:05:18.890
Why don't you just bend over and your own Dick is you sit on the bowl.

1078
01:05:19.030 --> 01:05:23.470
You fucking Douche. Fuck that guy peeing. Sitting down,

1079
01:05:23.850 --> 01:05:24.683
you know?

1080
01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.300
<v 8>Okay.</v>

1081
01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:31.090
<v 11>What else sir? What? What, what else is overrated? Lifting weights. Um,</v>

1082
01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:33.610
<v 8>okay.</v>

1083
01:05:33.610 --> 01:05:37.870
<v 11>Owning a gun. Chewing tobacco. Eating steak. What else?</v>

1084
01:05:37.871 --> 01:05:42.700
Drinking Scotch. Smoking cigars. Fixing your own car.

1085
01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:44.950
What else? Or what else is fucking overrated?

1086
01:05:44.951 --> 01:05:47.170
Everything that makes be an a guy fucking awesome.

1087
01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:50.980
Losing your shit because some guy you don't know Mr. Field Goal,

1088
01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:56.110
that really has no affect on your life. Talking Shit. Is that all overrated,

1089
01:05:56.140 --> 01:05:57.250
Lee Marvin?

1090
01:05:58.920 --> 01:05:59.753
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

1091
01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:02.490
<v 11>The only thing that's saved you surge, you didn't leave your name.</v>

1092
01:06:02.491 --> 01:06:05.490
So that that's the only thing that I can say is I can at least see that there

1093
01:06:05.491 --> 01:06:10.050
was sort of some, some sort of shame in your email.
