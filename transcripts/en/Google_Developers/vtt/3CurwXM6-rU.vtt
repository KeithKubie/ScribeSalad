00:00:04.522 --> 00:00:05.730
BELINDA LANGER: Hi, everyone.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.250
My name is Belinda
Langner, and I

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.230
am a Product Manager
here at Google

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.360
working on our app ads products.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.850
And today, we're going to talk
a lot about smart strategies

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.200
for growing your
business with ads.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.390
It's really great to
be back here at I/O

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.098
and see all of the amazing
things that you're building.

00:00:23.098 --> 00:00:24.890
I love this time of
year, because it really

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.520
energizes me to see how you
are all growing your businesses

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.180
and what kind of cool
apps you're developing.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.030
Technology really offers
the opportunity for us

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.050
to live more fulfilling
and balanced lives.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.180
And for me personally,
apps really

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.670
helped me unplug
after my daughter was

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.132
born exactly a year ago today.

00:00:46.132 --> 00:00:47.840
But no worries, I'm
not going to make you

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.220
sing "Happy Birthday" to her.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.980
She won't understand
anyways, right?

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.940
So one of the things that was
really important to me about

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.470
apps was, as becoming
a new parent,

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.140
I really wanted to
learn more about how

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.670
to be a really good parent.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.750
As a first-time
mom, I really wanted

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.390
to make sure I wasn't
doing anything wrong.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.500
And so as a natural person
who's really curious,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.950
I wanted to read up on
all the possible books

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.020
to learn how to sleep
train my daughter,

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.060
to figure out how to get
her to eat properly--

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.790
you know, all the
basics in life, right?

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.070
And so the Libby app
helped me borrow ebooks

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.830
from my local library so
that all the cool books

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.590
that people were recommending
to me, I could read up on.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.220
It helped me sync my bookmarks
across all of my devices.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.580
So no matter where I was,
I was able to just take

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.700
a quick look at my apps
and see what was going on.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.200
And it even let me beam
my books to my Kindle.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.050
Also, if you've
ever had a baby, you

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.680
don't get a lot of
free time, but you

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.630
want to cool off
every so often, right?

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.163
And so I also wanted to unwind
by playing "Golf Masters."

00:01:54.163 --> 00:01:55.580
And the nice thing
about this game

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.980
is that they're
such quick rounds,

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.880
so that I was able to get a
quick round in and just play

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.310
different courses really quickly
while my daughter was sleeping.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.560
And so with billions
of users like me

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.470
across the world engaging
with mobile apps,

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.620
the opportunity for you is huge.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.600
And competition is heating up.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.400
Users have higher
expectations for your app,

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.600
so you really need to find a
way to stand out while growing

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.120
quickly and profitably.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.887
And you want to find
the right users.

00:02:28.887 --> 00:02:30.470
You want to find
those right customers

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.780
and convert them effectively.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.140
And you need to create engaging,
user-friendly experiences.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.150
So this means that both your
app and your advertising dollars

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.200
have to work really
hard to set you apart.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.610
It's a lot to think about.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.940
The good news is
that technology can

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.850
handle a lot of the heavy
lifting of your business

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:55.822
with ads.

00:02:55.822 --> 00:02:58.030
And today, we're going to
talk a little bit about how

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.690
Google's smarter growth and
monetization strategies make

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.110
it easier for you to grow a
more profitable app business.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.250
So I'm going to kick things
off by talking about some

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.710
of the few launches
that we're doing,

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.280
both for Google App Campaigns,
formerly known as UAC.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.530
We'll talk a little bit about
some of the partnerships

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.870
that we're creating,
and then Duke

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.020
is going to talk about the
latest AdMob innovations that

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.900
make sure that you
help find smarter

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.010
monetization strategies.

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.297
So what are we waiting for?

00:03:29.297 --> 00:03:31.630
Let's dive in, because this
is what you're all here for,

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:32.130
right?

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.440
Building a profitable
app business

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.050
is not just about installs
and daily actives.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.900
I see a lot of head
shaking, so this really

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.040
resonates with you guys.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.610
You all know that it takes
smart growth strategies focused

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.570
on converting high-value
users at the right time

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.140
and at the right price.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.210
But today, it's not easy to
find advertisers and users that

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.610
will engage and transact.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.860
With your limited
resources, how do you

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.820
acquire new, high-value users
to drive your business forward?

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.580
And how do you keep
their attention?

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.350
We're so busy these days.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.960
It's so hard to make sure
that you even set aside time

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.649
to sit in this presentation,
to read up on the latest news,

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:20.160
to hang out with your family.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.130
So how do you keep
people's attention

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.390
so that they not only
install, but use your app,

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.320
transact on your app, and
come back time and time again?

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.360
So we built Google
App Campaigns to help

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.690
you reach users who really
want to use your app in more

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.470
of the moments that they're
already hanging out in.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.190
Our machine technology
helps handle the hard work

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.000
of helping you find the right
users across all of the Google

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.310
properties, including Google
Search, Google Play, YouTube,

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.170
and the 3 million sites
and apps in our network,

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.620
all in one campaign.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.460
And we come to I/O every year
to listen to your feedback.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:13.880
And we're working on unlocking
even more value for you

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.465
and the developer community.

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.500
So there are two
things that we need

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.050
to understand in order to
put our machine learning

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.650
to work for you.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.740
First, we didn't
know which users

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.070
mattered the most to making
your business profitable.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.780
When you think about
that perfect customer,

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.540
what are they doing?

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.210
Are they just installing
and using your app day in

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.800
and day out?

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.770
Are they getting through
the tutorials really fast?

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.130
Are they getting to certain
game levels really fast?

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.470
Are they making a purchase?

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.970
Knowing these critical moments
that these users are taking

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.070
helps drive value
for your business

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.580
and helps us find more users
who are similar to them.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.740
And second, we want
to know, how do you

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.710
want to show up to new users
with your ad creatives?

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.530
What do you want them to
remember about your app?

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.800
Users are discovering apps in
more ways than ever before.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.250
How do you want users to
interact with your ad?

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.830
Where do you want to find them?

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.280
Different users also want
different things from your app.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.710
Having the right
inputs helps Google

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.760
deliver the most relevant ad
in every possible opportunity

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.980
that a user is looking for
because we're all different,

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:35.210
and we all want different
things from our apps.

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.230
So let's go ahead and jump to
answering that first question--

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.180
how to find new
users that matter.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:48.390
Today in App Campaigns, we
offer two bidding strategies

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:49.890
to help you find
the right users.

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:52.980
And this really depends
on what your goal is.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.520
We have TCPI, or Target
Cost Per Install,

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.580
which lets you bid
on users who install.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.040
Tell us how much you want
to pay for each user who's

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.910
going to install, and
then we handle the rest.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:08.490
Going one step
further, if you want

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:10.920
to focus on specific
actions, we have

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:16.290
a bidding option called TCPA,
or Target Cost Per Action.

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:19.800
This lets you bid on users who
not only install, but also take

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.760
a specific, valuable
action within your app.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.310
Once you tell us which
conversions matter to you,

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.950
whether it be
subscribing, whether it

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:31.860
be making a purchase,
getting to a certain level,

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.230
spending a certain amount
of time in your app,

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:37.470
Google can now find people
who are likely to complete

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:40.330
these actions in the future.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:44.550
So to recap, if you're simply
focused on finding installs,

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.880
then we have TCPI bidding
to help you find more users

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.735
at a certain cost per install.

00:07:49.735 --> 00:07:51.360
If your business
model, though, depends

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:59.030
on acquiring users who will take
certain actions with your app,

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:02.090
then use TCPA bidding, or
Target Cost Per Action.

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:07.110
So I don't want
you just to hear it

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:09.390
from me, so I'm actually
going to show you a success

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:10.560
story from Maven--

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.650
an hourly car sharing and
rental service from GM.

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:15.800
Has anyone used them yet?

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.030
No?

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:19.550
Well, maybe you'll
try them later.

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:22.430
For Maven, the valuable in-app
actions they were looking

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.020
for are registrations--

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:27.410
the first steps that
users take to becoming

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:29.600
really active members.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.790
And this is because
Maven recognized

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:35.330
that they need to acquire
not just any user, but users

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:41.200
that will help them
grow a very loyal base.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.500
Let's take a look at their
experience bidding with TCPA

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.963
and how they used that to
optimize their ad campaigns.

00:08:47.963 --> 00:08:48.630
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:51.570
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:54.150
- Maven is an on-demand
car sharing service.

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:55.980
We launched in 2016.

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.190
We launched very quickly, with
eight markets in eight months.

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:01.110
- One of the biggest
challenges that we've had

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:02.652
was understanding
who are going to be

00:09:02.652 --> 00:09:05.820
the right people to target,
to talk to, in order

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.560
to have them actually
become a member,

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.870
register, and then
use our service?

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:12.850
- These days, an install
or download isn't enough.

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:17.370
We're really looking to find
those high-value members.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:21.240
- So we partnered with Google
to address our need of finding

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.690
high-value customers.

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:27.060
We've been able to increase
our registrations by 51%,

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:30.990
while decreasing our cost
per registration by 74%.

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:34.422
- One of the benefits of using
an automated campaign is that

00:09:34.422 --> 00:09:35.880
you get to be more
of a strategist,

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.450
being able to look at it
from a 30,000-foot view

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:41.850
and understand, this is
the campaign as a whole.

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.730
It gives me a lot more line of
sight of what's in the future,

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:47.200
instead of what's just
immediately on the horizon.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.840
- It does all the
hard work for us.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.970
With machine learning,
it's constantly

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:54.480
optimizing so that we can focus
our time, efforts, and energy

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.550
on finding other ways
that we can continue

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:59.130
to connect with our members.

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:00.830
- This partnership
has done really

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:03.070
well in addressing our
business challenges.

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:05.870
- This is where we're looking to
continue to find the high-value

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:06.540
members.

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.330
We know that Google
will allow us

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:11.045
to continue to drive and
grow our Maven business.

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:16.668
[END PLAYBACK]

00:10:16.668 --> 00:10:18.710
BELINDA LANGER: As you
can see, and as you heard,

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:21.080
we do our best here at
Google to make this process

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.310
effective and simple for you.

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:25.310
Those are some amazing metrics.

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:27.920
So we really want to make
sure that you can also

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.350
take advantage of
these opportunities.

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:32.990
Choose the action or the
actions that you want your users

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:38.170
to take, add your bids and
creatives, and let's get going.

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:43.680
But sometimes, it's
not easy to know

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:48.090
what bid you need to place or
start with in your TCPI or TCPA

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:49.140
campaigns.

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:50.910
It might take some experience.

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:54.090
So to help guide you,
we have Bid Landscapes.

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:56.560
And these are available
globally today,

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.980
so make sure to log into
your AdWords campaigns

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:01.290
and take a look.

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:03.630
This is a new App
Campaigns feature

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:07.290
that shows a bid that you should
place for your CPI or your CPA

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:10.530
campaigns to reach the scale
that makes sense for you,

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:13.300
to help you make the right
trade-offs for your business.

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:18.150
So you can visualize
the trade-offs

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:20.370
that you should consider
between both cost

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:23.820
and reach and compare your
performance of your app

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:25.440
against other, similar apps.

00:11:28.085 --> 00:11:32.310
And as you can see in this
example, the higher the CPI,

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:33.900
the more installs you will get--

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.630
duh.

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:40.170
But Bid Landscapes help you
estimate the incremental reach

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:42.750
that you get for a
particular increase in bid.

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:51.740
It's a great tool to
guide your decision

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.980
to adjust your bid at any
stage of your campaign,

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:57.877
make sure that you're achieving
the returns that you need,

00:11:57.877 --> 00:11:59.960
and that you can always
make the right trade-offs.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.600
Sometimes, you might
actually be a little bit more

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.400
flexible, though,
with your bids.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.830
Let's say you have
a new app launch,

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:14.170
or there's a new seasonal
event that you really

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:15.580
want to take advantage of.

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.470
Maybe you're really
focused on making sure

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.678
that people are buying those
last-minute Mother's Day

00:12:19.678 --> 00:12:20.650
gifts-- huh?

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:22.300
Hint, hint.

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:27.490
To give you that flexibility,
we announced GDC in March

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:31.330
that we are also beta testing
a third bidding option--

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:33.310
max conversions.

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:35.560
With Max Conversions,
you can actually

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:39.790
get as many installs as
possible within your budget.

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:42.070
Developers, like Huuuge
Games, are already

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:44.200
using Max Conversions,
and it really

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.890
helped their advertising
dollars go farther, faster.

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:49.550
This bidding strategy
actually helped

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:53.860
Huuge Games drive a 300%
increase in download

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.330
volume for their Huuge Games.

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.340
And it really helped
make an impact

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:59.110
in the markets
and the categories

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:01.718
that they care about,
finding more users that were

00:13:01.718 --> 00:13:03.010
going to engage with their app.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.870
With Max Conversions
and Bid Landscapes,

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:11.210
you now have a
simple and clear way

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:14.570
to expand your
base of app users.

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:17.000
But we know that
for many of you,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.610
installs and even conversions
don't tell that full story.

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:25.460
While they're a really
great starting point,

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:27.540
you want to grow
your app business,

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.930
so your focus should
shift towards the revenue

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:33.230
that each of these
users are generating.

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:35.270
It makes sense that
you would pay more

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:39.530
for someone who spends $50
than someone who spends $5.

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:43.640
These are basic things that
we learned in math class.

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:47.540
And that is why you will soon
be able to bid on the Target

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:52.490
Return On Ad Spend, or the
T-ROAS for each new acquired

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:53.690
user.

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:57.740
T-ROAS bidding lets you bid
dynamically and pay more

00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:00.620
for users who are
likely to spend more,

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:03.890
and pay less for users
likely to spend less,

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:08.080
making you more effective.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.410
And so to use
T-ROAS, you'll need

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:13.620
to report conversions and
conversion values to Google

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:16.050
Analytics for Firebase.

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:19.740
And for any given timeframe,
you can now specify the return

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:22.410
that you want to
earn from customers

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:26.230
relative to how much
you pay to acquire them.

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:29.460
In other words, when
you set your T-ROAS bid,

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:32.340
you're telling
Google what average

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:36.340
value you want to get back for
every dollar that you spent.

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:39.040
So let's take a
look at an example.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.600
If you're looking for users
that will spend twice as

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.320
much as they cost
to acquire, you

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:50.400
can now set 200% as
your return on ad spend.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.590
And that will be the
multiplier for your T-ROAS bid.

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:56.030
And it will help you
find users accordingly

00:14:56.030 --> 00:15:00.600
who will spend twice
as much as your cost.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:05.620
So if if they spend $50,
you're only paying $25.

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:08.880
T-ROAS bidding will be
available in the upcoming

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:13.500
months for App Campaigns
on both iOS and on Android.

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.540
So make sure to
be on the lookout

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:20.730
to take advantage of this
really great opportunity.

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:24.060
So I've talked about some of the
really great bidding solutions

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:26.250
that help you find more
of the right people

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:27.940
at the right price.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:32.970
But today's consumers have
more choices than ever before.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:34.560
Just like you guys
had many choices

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:38.430
of which talks to
come to, consumers

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:41.100
have many decisions on what
apps they want to download.

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:44.530
And so how do you make sure that
they're coming to your talk?

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:46.570
Oh, whoops-- how do
they make sure you're

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:49.470
downloading your app, right?

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:51.340
Even if you reach
the right people,

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:54.420
how do you win and
keep their attention?

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:57.630
So I'm going to take you
through some of our latest ad

00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:00.630
creative innovations which
help you do just that.

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:05.400
Think back to the last
time you saw an ad

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.517
for an app you didn't know.

00:16:08.517 --> 00:16:10.350
Giving you some time
to think about it here.

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:14.762
Where did you see it?

00:16:14.762 --> 00:16:15.872
AUDIENCE: Instagram.

00:16:15.872 --> 00:16:17.247
BELINDA LANGER:
What did you say?

00:16:17.247 --> 00:16:18.080
AUDIENCE: Instagram?

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.164
BELINDA LANGER: Instagram?

00:16:19.164 --> 00:16:19.760
OK, yeah.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.950
You've seen it in the apps
that you're playing with.

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:24.320
Some people probably
saw it on a website.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:28.100
And some of you might have
been watching a video, right?

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:30.500
What interested
you about that app?

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.500
What piqued your interest?

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.630
Chances are there was
something about it that

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:38.060
captured your attention,
making it easier

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:39.870
for you to take action.

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:43.760
And it was relevant to
what you were looking for.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.980
But different people
have different tastes

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:47.090
and different goals.

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:49.470
We're not all the same.

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:50.960
So what may be
the right elements

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:54.950
for you may not be the right
elements for the person sitting

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:56.510
next to you.

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:58.700
It takes a lot of
time and resources

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:01.970
to create versions of
the apps and ads that

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:04.339
are relatable to
everyone, let alone

00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:07.280
reaching them in the right
places and all the ways

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.829
that they can discover your app.

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:15.710
To empower Google to do a
lot of this work for you,

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:18.680
it's important that you
provide all the different types

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.000
of assets that we ask of you.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.140
So it's good to make sure
that you have at least four

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:28.430
text ideas, videos in both
the portrait and the landscape

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:32.960
mode, and images in both the
portrait and landscape modes

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:34.670
as well.

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:37.760
These assets alone make
sure that you are ahead

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.640
of the pack in terms
of your creatives.

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:48.360
And to really
maximize your success,

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:52.700
we suggest you upload as
many high-quality assets

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:56.000
as possible in the
dimensions outlined.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.480
And what do we do with them?

00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.020
Well, machine
learning, of course.

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:03.020
We stitch them into
creatives, and we find out

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:07.970
which combinations resonate
the best with our users.

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:11.300
By including diverse
ad assets and formats,

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:15.740
Google can help you deliver
more of the relevant ads

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.720
to the right people
in more of the places

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.390
that people are looking.

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:24.930
And YouTube is one
of those places.

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:27.780
As the world's largest
video platform,

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:31.680
YouTube is where people go
to hang out and watch content

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.840
that they care about.

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:37.110
And we've opened up a
new reach opportunity

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:40.680
on the YouTube [INAUDIBLE] feed.

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:44.925
And you are able to get
more scale and more value

00:18:44.925 --> 00:18:47.670
through your image ads.

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:51.280
Simply upload a landscape
image to your App Campaigns,

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.030
and you are eligible
to reach more users

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:57.000
on the front door of YouTube.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.580
If you have a landscape
image, well, you

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:02.708
can just lean back and
enjoy all of the extra reach

00:19:02.708 --> 00:19:04.500
that you're already
getting, because you've

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.970
got this automatically.

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:09.540
We even take care of
the extra formatting

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:12.180
to make sure that it
looks really snazzy

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:15.750
and catches
everyone's attention.

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:18.510
This means that you can
drive a lot more impact

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:24.220
through App Campaigns with
very little extra effort.

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:27.220
Another way to make sure that
you're engaging with your users

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:30.370
and catching their attention
is through video ads.

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:32.200
This is a great
way to catch people

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:36.890
who are in the market and
really ready to take action.

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:42.140
We've introduced full-canvas,
instream video ads on YouTube.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:45.190
All you need to do is
upload your video assets,

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:49.150
and we automatically create
a panel underneath your ad

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:52.300
to show users more about
all the amazing work

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:54.910
that your team
has been building.

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:57.850
The panel automatically
opens once that video ad

00:19:57.850 --> 00:20:01.750
begins to play, allowing
a user to browse through

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:02.920
while watching your ad.

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:09.760
This gives a lot more room to
communicate your call to action

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:13.150
and to feature all the
compelling images of all

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:15.880
the neat features that I
know you guys are working on

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:17.630
right now.

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:19.630
And we pull this
information directly

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:22.840
from the apps we're listing.

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:26.950
Both of these YouTube formats
are fully available today.

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:29.830
And we're working to bring
you even more innovations

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:30.460
in the future.

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:38.650
So once you've put your ad
in front of potential users,

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:41.280
the next step is to show
them why they should install

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.290
and engage with your ad.

00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:45.120
And to do that, we've
already been talking

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.100
about how we need to
make sure your ads

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:50.260
are as engaging as possible.

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:52.980
So to help achieve this,
starting this month,

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:58.080
we are launching ad groups
for all App Campaigns.

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:00.240
Within a single
campaign now, you're

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:04.080
going to be able to set up
multiple ad groups to house

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:08.880
the creative assets and to
group distinct themes together

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:12.060
to tailor your marketing
message to different groups

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:13.630
of customers.

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:15.750
And this seems pretty
abstract, so let's go ahead

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:19.000
and walk through an example.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.060
Let's say that you're
Headspace, a meditation app.

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:27.510
You can now create an ad group
for your meditation for sleep

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:30.570
offerings, and a
second group focused

00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:34.740
on your stress-relieving
options.

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:39.120
In each ad group, you can add
images and videos specifically

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:42.690
catering to people who
want to unwind before bed--

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:45.510
something I know that I
could totally get behind.

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:48.000
It totally appeals to me.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.990
Or you might want to have an ad
group focused on finding ways

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:56.190
that people can take
mini-meditation sessions

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:58.890
on the go.

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:02.160
You can also create another
ad group for your generic ads

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:05.460
with an image and a video
promoting the general benefits

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:07.440
of relaxing the mind.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:10.530
I'm sure we could all
get behind that one.

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:12.570
And no matter what
your vertical,

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:14.520
ad groups gives you
the creative control

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:17.100
to pique your users'
interest with hooks

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:18.270
that they can relate to.

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:26.970
Now you may think, this is a
lot of new tools for creatives,

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:28.620
a lot of control.

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:31.470
And these all present
really great opportunities,

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:34.560
but they also mean that now you
have so much more information

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:35.820
to process.

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:38.640
And you have a lot
more decisions to make.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:41.220
This is a lot to take in.

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:43.230
To help you navigate
this, we are

00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:49.110
supporting an open ecosystem
of amazing, creative agency

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:54.060
partners that can work with
you to develop assets, capture

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:58.530
and act on all the insights that
are reporting offers to you,

00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:01.890
and amplify your success
with all of the goodness

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:03.030
that we just talked about.

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:09.210
So today, we are so
excited to announce

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:13.200
a formalized partnership with
our app, Preferred Creative

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.060
Partners.

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:21.410
They include apptamin, Consumer
Acquisition, Kaizen, Bamboo,

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:25.470
Kuaizi, Creadits,
Webpals, and VidMob.

00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:33.330
Every one of these
app-preferred creative partners

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:38.030
can create assets across the
entire spectrum of Google Ad

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:39.410
formats.

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:43.400
And as you can see, they have
locations all across the world.

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.790
So they have both the global
and the local insights

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:48.860
to help you and
guide you if you're

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:52.940
looking to expand your
current set of markets,

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:57.200
or if you're looking to expand
into new markets and regions.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:00.980
You can rely on these partners
to build the best assets

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:04.130
to leverage the innovations
that we talked about.

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:08.870
Let us and let them help you
get the most out of your ads.

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:11.660
And you should focus on
building the best apps

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:13.227
that you can so
that you can come

00:24:13.227 --> 00:24:15.185
tell me next year about
all your cool launches.

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:20.870
So I've shared a
few new ways for you

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:24.350
to grow faster with both bidding
and creative optimizations

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:26.360
and innovations and
the partnerships that

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:29.280
can take your app campaigns
to the next level.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:31.589
Let's give a warm
welcome now to Duke,

00:24:31.589 --> 00:24:33.422
who's going to talk
more about monetization.

00:24:33.422 --> 00:24:36.712
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:36.808 --> 00:24:37.850
DUKE DUKELLIS: Thank you.

00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:38.642
Thank you, Belinda.

00:24:38.642 --> 00:24:42.290
Nothing is more exciting than
growing your user acquisition,

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:47.030
except maybe monetizing
them to support

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:51.080
the livelihood of the developers
and this amazing ecosystem

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.330
that we have globally.

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:53.830
It's a critical component.

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:55.110
So I'm Duke Dukellis.

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:59.690
I lead product management
for apps across AdMob

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:04.460
and across Google Ad Manager,
our ads monetization platforms.

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:06.620
And I'm going to talk
to you about some things

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:10.340
that we're doing to really
simplify how you can make

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:13.080
money, make it easier overall.

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:18.000
OK, so we all know about IAP.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.590
What a lot of
developers don't know,

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:22.380
though, is supplementing IAP--

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:27.510
revenue-- with ads is a great
way to grow revenue overall.

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:31.450
And we're even
seeing, in some cases,

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:35.510
this is actually
driving higher IAP.

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:38.770
Now, we looked at the
Google games on Play--

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:41.690
or games overall
on Google Play--

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:45.380
and we saw, last year,
a 34% growth in games

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:48.140
that have both IAP and ads, OK?

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:50.030
So something's working here.

00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:53.480
They're finding ways
to put these together

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.890
to drive better revenue overall.

00:25:55.890 --> 00:26:00.590
So we know this is here,
but we also it can be hard.

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:03.460
It can be hard to add
in ads to optimize.

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:07.090
And so we really think about,
how can we make this as simple

00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:09.580
as possible for everyone,
give time back to you

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:15.110
to focus still on making
great games and apps?

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:18.370
So really, when it comes
to ads monetization,

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:21.990
the growth hinges on a
positive user experience, OK?

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:25.240
So we've got to start with
choosing the best formats.

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.680
Every app's different.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.030
There is no one-size-fits-all.

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:32.440
So that's why we offer
four rich formats--

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:38.950
interstitial, banners,
rewarded ads, and native ads.

00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:42.830
And let's walk through these
one by one real quickly.

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:45.580
And so interstitial is
these full-screen takeovers.

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:46.930
They have static.

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:48.160
They have video.

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:48.850
Both.

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:53.230
These are really popular in
apps that change screens a lot.

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:56.470
And it's really important you
find those natural transition

00:26:56.470 --> 00:27:00.920
points, because you want
to minimize disruption.

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:05.340
And that will help you
also grow revenue overall.

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:08.547
Secondly, banners--
typically, we

00:27:08.547 --> 00:27:10.005
see these as anchors
on the bottom.

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.570
And this really works well
on these single-screen apps

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:19.620
where you have the ads visible
the majority of the time.

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:22.020
And these are quite
easy to implement.

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:24.610
And we see them across
all different categories,

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:29.360
whether it's games,
or news, or utilities.

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:31.710
Third, rewarded ads--
now, these are opt-in.

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:33.330
These are most recent.

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:36.510
And this is about giving
the user something

00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:37.680
in exchange for their time.

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:40.680
You're giving them
an in-app something.

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:44.340
And these are a great
option for developers

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:48.810
to really try to offer the
semi-premium experience.

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:52.860
Because a lot of
times, that user

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:57.810
they can't or they
won't buy right now.

00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:02.440
So how do we give
them that flavor,

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:05.010
give them that semi-premium
experience, and they might

00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:07.290
come back and convert later?

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:09.000
This also drives
more engagement,

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.520
because they're getting
more invested as they go.

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:15.355
And this is particularly
popular in games.

00:28:15.355 --> 00:28:16.730
But what's very
exciting is we're

00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:22.580
starting to see this crop up in
a number of other categories.

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:26.120
And lastly, native
ads-- and they

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:29.000
really let you customize
that look and that feel.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.270
And this is great for the
developer who really wants

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:36.680
to go that extra mile to
make that ad blend in,

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:40.460
to feel like a natural
extension of the app.

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:43.070
And we see this great
on feeds in particular,

00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:47.540
where it really just
feels like a natural part.

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:50.220
The look and the
feel are consistent.

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:56.720
Now, all of these formats allow
you to choose video, static,

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.200
or both.

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:00.470
So video is oftentimes
an overlay in this,

00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:02.030
but that gives you
a lot of options.

00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:03.920
And you've got a
lot of options here.

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:05.630
In some apps, we see
different formats--

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:07.970
some, all of them,
some, just one of them.

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:11.270
But you can really choose
what is best for your app

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:14.227
to get the best monetization.

00:29:14.227 --> 00:29:15.560
So you've got the right formats.

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:16.734
Good.

00:29:16.734 --> 00:29:19.950
OK, so next step is making
sure that your users

00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:22.860
are having a safe experience.

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:25.210
You want tha6t
audience to feel safe.

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:31.170
It includes showing only
high-quality ads, and safe,

00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:35.180
like appropriate ads for
your particular audience.

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:37.320
And when that unwanted
ad does appear,

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:41.800
you've really got to get
to it quickly, manage it

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.120
so it doesn't have an
impact on your audience.

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.495
So we've got a
unique set of tools

00:29:46.495 --> 00:29:49.120
that we've been developing here
to make this faster and simpler

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:49.620
for you.

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:55.660
So first, I want to talk about
and introduce this new tool,

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:57.470
called AdMob Image Search.

00:29:57.470 --> 00:30:03.720
So this lets you upload
a screenshot of the ad.

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:09.390
And we can immediately identify
the ad and all the variants

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:12.870
across size, and
rotation, and campaigns.

00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:15.990
So instead of having to search
through hundreds or thousands,

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:18.540
and sometimes tens of thousands
of ads that are going out

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:22.050
to users, we make this
instant and automated for you

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:23.340
so we can block those ads.

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:29.292
Second piece is ad
content ratings--

00:30:29.292 --> 00:30:30.750
it's something
we're very proud of.

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:34.770
Now, when it comes
to brand safety--

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:37.020
and I will say this as
a father of two girls--

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:41.070
nothing is more important
than making sure we're

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:43.830
protecting kids' experiences.

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:48.450
Now, with AdMob, you can
set this maximum ad content

00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:50.530
rating to whatever you want.

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:56.410
So that could be G,
PG, Teen, or Mature.

00:30:56.410 --> 00:30:59.950
And these settings can be
customized at an account level

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:01.660
overall.

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:05.080
They can be set at an app level.

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:07.810
And both of those can be
done with a simple checkbox

00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:08.720
in the interface.

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:12.820
You don't need to
recompile and push out.

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:17.290
Now, if your app also happens
to serve a combination of adults

00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:21.880
and kids, you can also,
at a per impression level,

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:26.692
request different ratings
based on who your audience is.

00:31:26.692 --> 00:31:28.900
That can be done at an
impression level with our SDK.

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:35.170
OK, so you've got
your ad set up.

00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:37.140
You've got your protections.

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:40.310
So now let's think about
running your business.

00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:45.090
And that requires actionable
reports and analytics.

00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:48.300
And unlike many
other platforms, we

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:53.010
offer insights into
both ads performance,

00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:56.972
and also user metrics
all in one place.

00:31:56.972 --> 00:31:58.680
And we can put the
data together and make

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.490
some really smart decisions.

00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:04.650
And we do this without
needing to integrate an SDK--

00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:06.000
an additional SDK.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.955
So this can help you
optimize the lifetime

00:32:07.955 --> 00:32:10.455
value of your customers overall
by merging these and getting

00:32:10.455 --> 00:32:11.530
them some good insight.

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:14.040
So you can find out
things like, what

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:24.120
is my total revenue across IAP
and ads on iOS, for example?

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:27.568
Or how are my daily
average users looking?

00:32:27.568 --> 00:32:28.860
What's my average session time?

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:29.920
What's happening there?

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:31.620
And now let's blend
that together.

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:33.370
And let me show you
an example here.

00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:37.950
So this is our new
rewarded ads report.

00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:42.330
So with this report, you'll
have instant access to this.

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:44.310
It helps you track how
changes to what you're

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:48.580
doing with rewarded ads are
impacting your metrics overall.

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:51.150
So this is really the
best way to understand,

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:55.470
how am I doing with my
rewarded ads implementation?

00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:58.380
And you can answer some really
interesting questions here.

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:01.980
So did adding that
rewarded ad-- did

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:05.046
that increase my session time?

00:33:05.046 --> 00:33:05.920
Hm.

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:06.420
Yeah.

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:10.220
Did increasing this frequency
of when I give people

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:16.200
a rewarded ad-- well, did
that drive my IAP up or down?

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:17.920
Hm.

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:18.670
I'd like to know.

00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:21.460
And what percentage of
your daily active users

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:23.620
are actually using rewarded?

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:26.470
And how does it look with them?

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:29.170
These are all good
questions that merge

00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:32.040
a lot of these pieces of data.

00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:34.560
And they help you have
actionable insights.

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:36.780
You can immediately go
change your revenue--

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:37.510
immediately.

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:41.190
So these user reports,
the rewarded ads report--

00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:43.440
they're all part of the
out-of-the-box solution.

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:46.080
You don't need to do
anything to set these up.

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:47.130
They just come.

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:49.650
You instantly get access
to that, no extra work.

00:33:52.432 --> 00:33:54.640
All right, so the last step
I want to talk about here

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:58.510
is when we're really talking
about business success,

00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:02.290
it's you want the highest
value for your ads--

00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:05.650
every impression, highest
value-- and without spending

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:09.096
a lot of time optimizing.

00:34:09.096 --> 00:34:10.679
So that's where open
bidding comes in.

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:14.440
Now, we announced open
bidding last year.

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.550
The idea here is quite simple.

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:20.170
We let all the networks
that participate bid

00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:26.139
in to a single auction in real
time, and the winner wins.

00:34:26.139 --> 00:34:27.219
It's that simple.

00:34:27.219 --> 00:34:29.290
So unlike traditional
mediation, which

00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:31.690
is how a lot of the
industry works today,

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:35.170
instead of having to take
average historical data

00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:39.429
and then use that to prioritize
a bunch of different networks

00:34:39.429 --> 00:34:42.850
and then call them in
sequence, so instead

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:44.512
of having to work
through all that,

00:34:44.512 --> 00:34:46.179
we're taking all the
networks, and we're

00:34:46.179 --> 00:34:47.949
calling them at one time.

00:34:47.949 --> 00:34:50.350
You get the bids,
and they compete

00:34:50.350 --> 00:34:54.929
in a single, unified auction.

00:34:54.929 --> 00:34:57.200
So that means for
any given impression,

00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:01.570
whoever is willing to
pay the highest wins.

00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:02.290
That's it.

00:35:02.290 --> 00:35:04.210
Because all these
networks are competing

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:08.270
at exactly the same level,
the same time, same priority,

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:08.830
even Google.

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:13.200
So not only is
open bidding going

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.450
to drive higher revenue
because everyone's

00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:17.340
competing for each
of those users

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:19.480
on a real-time,
one-by-one basis,

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:23.520
but it's also going to decrease
a lot of the extra time

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:26.670
and effort that's gone
into trying to set this up

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:27.340
previously.

00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:29.790
So with open bidding,
you don't have

00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:32.130
to implement all these SDKs.

00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:34.890
Instead, a lot of them are
sending the demand directly

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:40.420
through Google and
participating in that way.

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:43.110
Secondly, you don't need
to spend a lot of time

00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:44.460
managing all the waterfalls.

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:48.060
Because if you recall,
this is one auction now.

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:50.610
So you don't need
waterfall after waterfall.

00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:54.250
You're getting the
best price right away.

00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:58.468
Now also, because we're
getting all of that

00:35:58.468 --> 00:36:00.510
to compete in one place
and you have all the data

00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:02.940
from the different
networks, the report

00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:05.230
has all of the competing
networks in one spot.

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:07.170
So you're going to see
that in one dashboard

00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:09.838
with completely
accurate information,

00:36:09.838 --> 00:36:11.880
and not have to go to a
bunch of different places

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:14.490
to get that collective picture.

00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:17.220
And then the last piece,
here-- so payments.

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:19.200
So instead of having
to go track payments

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:22.020
across a bunch of
different networks,

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:24.960
we've worked with them--
so for almost all networks,

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:27.270
we handle all of the
payments for you.

00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:29.920
So you'll get a collective
check right away.

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:34.560
So we really simplify that
and make it easier for you.

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:35.820
So today, open bidding--

00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:38.830
we've got eight partners
that are live and bidding.

00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:41.070
So I want to call out--

00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:46.200
we have Facebook, Audience
Network, AppLovin, and Tapjoy.

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:49.750
They've all recently joined,
and they're now bidding.

00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:52.050
We're seeing great momentum
on this initiative.

00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:55.770
And by bringing together some
of the largest, most diverse app

00:36:55.770 --> 00:37:01.440
networks globally, it's
just driving more revenue

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:02.445
for our app partners.

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:11.680
So our partners are actually
pretty excited about this.

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:13.823
The industry, I
would say as a whole,

00:37:13.823 --> 00:37:15.240
is really looking
forward to this,

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:18.970
because it just does everything
much, much more efficiently.

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:20.370
And it's good for developers.

00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:26.520
And Vijay Balan-- so he's the
head of Publisher Solution

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:28.980
Partnerships at Facebook
Audience Network-- and here's

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:31.380
what he says.

00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:35.580
Bidding is important in creating
a fair and open ad ecosystem.

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:38.260
So we're excited to work with
Google to make this happen.

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:41.380
This is about the real-time
bidding in one place,

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:43.420
in a fair auction.

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:47.160
With that unified auction,
developers, less time,

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:48.960
more money.

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.985
So our developers are
pretty excited about what

00:37:50.985 --> 00:37:51.610
they're seeing.

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:53.520
So we've got dozens
of partners right now,

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:57.630
dozens of publishers that
are joining the beta.

00:37:57.630 --> 00:38:00.000
They're seeing meaningful
impacts already,

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.960
including-- so let me
spotlight Sticky Hands, here.

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:05.980
This is a Korean app developer--

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:07.110
Sticky Hands.

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:09.150
So Minu Kim-- so
he's tried this out.

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:12.000
He's seen 14%
increase in revenue,

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.715
just by implementing
open bidding.

00:38:14.715 --> 00:38:19.260
And he's seen 15%
ARPDAU increase.

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:22.200
And he's saying that
the revenue impact--

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:26.010
it's already impactful,
the revenue lift.

00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:28.710
And we expect it to
keep getting better

00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:31.110
as we continue to
add more partners

00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:33.450
into that single auction.

00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:35.090
So the momentum is continuing.

00:38:35.090 --> 00:38:39.340
The results are already
starting to show.

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:42.050
All right, so as
you've seen today,

00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:45.710
we're really invested
in helping you

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:50.680
do what you need to do
to build your growth

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:52.280
and to build your monetization.

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:54.890
So Belinda talked about
a few things, here--

00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:56.990
setting the right
bid, whether that's

00:38:56.990 --> 00:39:00.650
with T-ROAS or with
the Bid Landscapes,

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:03.560
and about putting your
best creative face forward

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:07.460
with the new opportunities on
YouTube, with the ad groups,

00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:11.890
and with our Preferred
Creative Partner program.

00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:13.460
And on the monetization
side, we're

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:18.290
really trying to help simplify
and drive higher revenue here--

00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:22.400
simplify things like protecting
your brand with the age ratings

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:25.370
or with the Advanced
Creative Search,

00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:28.640
but also to drive more
revenue through open bidding

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:30.470
and through better
reporting and insights

00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:32.950
you can take action on.

00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:36.500
Now, these smart optimizations
that we're doing here--

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:39.890
