00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.045
In this lesson, we're going to learn about this, our brain. And how the

00:00:03.045 --> 00:00:06.595
different areas of the brain are responsible for different things. And how our

00:00:06.595 --> 00:00:10.356
brain makes us uniquely human. We're also going to learn about the nervous

00:00:10.356 --> 00:00:14.216
system and neurotransmitters, such a dopamine or serotonin. And how they all

00:00:14.216 --> 00:00:18.520
come together to help us do the amazing things that humans can do.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.700
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Everything about who we are. What we think, what we imagine, what we dream and

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.564
even who we like is a function of our brain and it's activity. Damage to the

00:00:29.564 --> 00:00:33.843
brain can have some devastating consequences. Too much of some

00:00:33.843 --> 00:00:37.107
neurotransmitters can cause problems, too few of some can cause problems as

00:00:37.107 --> 00:00:41.353
well. In this lesson we're going to learn about the delicate balance of the

00:00:41.353 --> 00:00:44.511
brain and its activity. And it's important important for you to master this

00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:47.085
material, because we will be discussing the brain throughout the remainder of

00:00:47.085 --> 00:00:48.410
the course.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.860
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So Susan's right. Now let's start with the basics. Many people know that we

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.094
inherit genetic information from our parents and this determines things like

00:00:56.094 --> 00:01:01.230
hair or eye color. But genetics aren't set in stone. Now the environment can

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.022
change the expression of our genetics. Now to talk more about how our genetics

00:01:05.022 --> 00:01:08.184
makes us who we are today, I want to bring in Matt, our genetics expert here at

00:01:08.184 --> 00:01:09.869
