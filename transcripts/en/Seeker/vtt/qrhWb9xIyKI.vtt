00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.060
Just because drinking water is clear, doesn't
mean there aren't tiny things living in there.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:12.680
But seriously, don't worry about it!

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.180
Greetings programs, Trace here, thanks for
watching DNews.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.640
Last weekend, a teenager in Portland, Oregon
released the contents of his bladder into

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.640
a public reservoir.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.690
As a result of the public outcry, the city
will spend who-knows-how-much to dump 38 MILLION

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.840
gallons of their drinking water.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.200
38 MILLION?!

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.360
During a drought?!

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.710
Are they crazy?

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.040
Yeah, they kind of are.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.700
Open reservoirs are weird.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.930
Water has to be cleaned and then stored somewhere,
and sometimes it's water towers, sometimes

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.390
it's large tanks and sometimes... for some
reason... in man made, open ponds.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.390
What comes into ponds?!

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.390
ANIMALS.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:55.960
In fact they don't just come in them, they
swim and poop and pee and live and wash and

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.460
whatever in them too.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.570
In fact, the Portland City Water Bureau Administrator
David Schaff said, they have a commitment

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.780
to clean water "That doesn't include pee.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.149
Not from people, at least."

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:09.659
HE BASICALLY ADMITTED OTHER THINGS PEE IN
IT.

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:10.759
The thing is, DUH.

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:11.759
And whatever.

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:12.990
It doesn't hurt anything.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.990
At all.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.990
Ever.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.119
According to MATH, the typical human urination
produces about two cups (400-500mL), a VERY

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:20.539
small amount.

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:25.819
Of that, 95 percent is water which leaves
about five teaspoons of waste.

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:36.609
38 million gallons dumped because of five
teaspoons -- which works out to about 0.000000017

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:38.689
percent urine waste.

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.490
Drinking water, even bottled, will often contain
organic and inorganic material, pesticides,

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.189
runoff, and radioactive contaminants.

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.270
It's part of the world we live in.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:55.159
The EPA says ZERO is often the goal for dangerous
things, but their Maximum Safe Contaminant

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.770
Levels are... well, they're not zero.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.799
In SAFE drinking water there is more Dichloroethene
which in high concentrations would cause cancer,

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.560
Thallium which in high concentrations would
cause Hair loss; changes in blood as well

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.729
as kidney, intestine, liver problems.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:16.560
Even Mercury from landfill runoff, cyanide
from steel mill runoff, and so on.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.940
The Upper SAFE limit for coliforms -- which
are bacteria living on fecal material -- is

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.180
5 percent.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.370
The bacteria themselves doesn't indicate poop
is in the water.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.920
So you're probably drinking weird things anyway.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.180
Just in general, and you're fine.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.760
I call this the Spotlight Effect, if we didn't
SEE this person peeing in the reservoir, it

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.310
would have been fine.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.140
And even though decades of health science,
regulation and testing make tap water all

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.489
over the country extremely safe Portland is
dumping it.

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:47.489
Why?

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:48.489
Because Portland's residents were upset.

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.410
Science doesn't always win in these cases.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.909
People feel weird about drinking the water!

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:55.489
It happens.

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.660
There's an easy way to fix this, but it's
expensive.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.909
Close the tops of the reservoirs.

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:05.830
The State of Oregon has plans to button up
their drop top reservoirs by 2020, but for

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.200
now, they're wide open.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.060
In 2008, the city dumped 8 million gallons
after a dude peed in it.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.769
That cost 35,000 dollars.

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.959
In 2011, a couple skinny dippers caused another
dump // REALLY?!

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.540
*smh* // But overall this won't affect anything
with Portland's water anyway.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.709
They store 35 billion gallons of water for
the city, 35 million is a literal drop in

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:30.709
that bucket.

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:31.709
I'd drink that water anyway, ship it down
to the deserts!

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:32.709
What about you?

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.520
Tell us what you'd want to do with all that
H2O down in the comments and thank you all

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.980
for tuning in!

We're now in the top 1000 YouTube channels!

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:41.079
Hello to newbies, and thanks for oldies.

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:42.760
You're all great.
