00:00:00.954 --> 00:00:03.120
NIGEL SYLVESTER: The world
from beyond my handlebars

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.610
is such a unique position.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:06.560
It moves faster.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.830
It's more intense.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.710
I'm forced to think faster.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.520
I feel more comfortable riding
my bike sometimes than walking.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.600
LAURA LING: When I watch you
ride, I am just transfixed.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.016
How did you get into BMX?

00:00:20.016 --> 00:00:22.140
NIGEL SYLVESTER: Like most
kids in my neighborhood,

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.170
just riding bicycles
around was the thing to do.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.000
It was a natural thing for us.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.580
It was fun.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.330
It was a way to get to
where ever we wanted to go.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:37.920
And it was that first point of
like, I felt freedom from home.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.490
And a lot of years
passed in between

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.120
until I finally seen BMX riding
for the first time on TV.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.360
And that's what really
changed everything for me.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.980
And once I seen that,
I was like, wow,

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.680
this is what I really
want to do in my life.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.700
Because of my neighborhood
and because of my environment,

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.260
riding BMX on a
professional level

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.630
and dreaming to be a
professional BMX rider

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:01.680
wasn't common.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.644
People would sometimes
call me a white boy

00:01:03.644 --> 00:01:05.310
because they didn't
understand the sport

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.370
and because they
associated BMX riding

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.630
with only young white
men from middle America

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.660
or places like that.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.660
But it was something that
I had for a very long.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.820
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.940
I'm a kid from Queens.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.140
And I would have never
imagined in a million years

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.515
that I would have
the opportunity

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:25.060
to ride my bicycle
around the world.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.956
It's incredible.

00:01:27.956 --> 00:01:30.330
LAURA LING: Did you get pressure
at home from your family

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.090
to follow that traditional
route and go to school

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.885
and get a good job?

00:01:33.885 --> 00:01:35.010
NIGEL SYLVESTER: Of course.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.040
My family, my mom and
dad, came to America

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.025
to pursue better opportunities.

00:01:41.025 --> 00:01:44.490
It was very rigid growing
up, which was fine.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.010
It taught me a lot of
valuable life lessons

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.650
that I would later
carry on into my career.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:50.620
LAURA LING: Like what?

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.530
NIGEL SYLVESTER: Hard work.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.870
I learned hard
work and dedication

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.780
and sacrifice at
home from my family.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.390
And those are things that
I use every single day.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.370
It's like, how much are
you willing to sacrifice?

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.980
How hard are you willing
to work to go achieve

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.536
your goals and your dreams?

00:02:09.536 --> 00:02:10.910
LAURA LING: How
hard do you work?

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.930
NIGEL SYLVESTER: I
work every single day.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.400
Anyone that knows me knows that
I'm thinking about bike riding,

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.580
I'm thinking about a project
every single second of the day.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.860
And when it comes to
the actual bike riding,

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.920
sometimes it may take
one try to land a trick.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.035
Other times, it
may take one day.

00:02:31.035 --> 00:02:32.070
It make take a week.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.010
It may be something you
have to leave and come

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.840
back and try again.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.710
LAURA LING: You're not just
a professional BMX rider.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.800
You really are a BMX
artist and filmmaker.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.760
You make these really
incredible videos

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.740
riding around different cities.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.990
What are you trying to
accomplish through your videos?

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.900
NIGEL SYLVESTER: For me, it's
about sharing my point of view

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.130
with the world.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.740
Not many people can get on a
bike and go blast on a bridge

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.666
or bomb a hill in SF or blast
through Shibuya Crossing.

00:03:02.666 --> 00:03:04.040
I want to share
that with people.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.872
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.300
For me, I never really
embraced riding contests.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.310
It's always been about content.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.480
I just want to deliver
people an amazing experience.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.680
I want them to watch my
videos and just be in awe

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.465
and be amazed and learn
something and be inspired.

00:03:24.465 --> 00:03:26.720
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.620
LAURA LING: Would you
say that BMX riding

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.635
is THE ritual of your life?

00:03:30.635 --> 00:03:33.840
NIGEL SYLVESTER: It's something
I do almost every single day.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.560
And if I'm not doing it,
I'm thinking about it.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.830
You know, it's always
around me, all the time.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.610
It's one of those
conflicts in my life.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.670
The feeling of landing a
trick is like nothing else

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.560
and it never gets old.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.460
It's such an adrenaline rush.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.130
It's such a feeling of
a self-accomplishment.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.750
It's more than just
doing a bike trick.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.150
It's about making it look good,
about making it beautiful.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.755
The majority of
people in your life

00:04:00.755 --> 00:04:02.455
have ridden a bicycle before.

00:04:02.455 --> 00:04:04.640
They know the feeling.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.720
They know that feeling
of cruising down a block

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.570
and how joyful that is,
that level of independence.

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.700
Once you find that sweet
spot and you find it

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.079
all on your own, you're
able to just soar.

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.529
