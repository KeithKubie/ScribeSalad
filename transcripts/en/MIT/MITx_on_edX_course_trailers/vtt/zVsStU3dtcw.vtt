00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.990
ANANT AGARWAL: Welcome to MITx.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.720
MIT'S worldwide online
learning initiative.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.920
We are delighted to have you join us for
6.002x Circuits and Electronics,

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.940
the inaugural course of MITx.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.690
6.002x is the same as electronics
circuits course taken by MIT students

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:32.490
as the first course in an
EE or EECS major at MIT.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.890
This course will help you make the
transition from physics to electrical

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.600
engineering.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.830
In this course, you will learn about
a lot of fun things, including the

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:47.540
foundations behind many cool devices
such as the smartphone.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.510
The course will be hard and we
want you to stick with us.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.500
It is our hope that you will have
a lot of fun in this course.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.200
Let me start by introducing
you to our team.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.740
I am Anant Agarwal.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.490
Like most MIT faculty, I have a wide
range of interests including a

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:05.884
fascination around chain saws.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.610
GERRY SUSSMAN: Hello, I'm Gerry Sussman,
professor of electrical

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.100
engineering at MIT.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.645
I've been a faculty member
here since 1973.

00:01:22.645 --> 00:01:27.180
I build electronics, optics, computer
software, and I repair

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.430
watches as a hobby.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.460
PIOTR MITROS: I'm Piotr Mitros.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.380
I'm a research scientist at MIT.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.300
And I was in charge of developing the
software infrastructure for MITx.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.370
As a graduate student, I spent a lot
of time traveling around India,

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.530
Nigeria, and China mostly as part of
educational technology projects so I'm

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.610
very excited to be helping
out with this course.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.746
ANANT AGARWAL: Whether we like
chain saws or watches, we are

00:01:51.746 --> 00:01:53.540
all passionate educators.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.600
We welcome your participation and any
feedback you might have to improving

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.480
the learning experience.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.730
Let's get started.
