00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.480
 . 

00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.190
 In this presentation I want to give you an example of what 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.170
 It means matching information for the line 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.730
 Instead of making a traditional display using 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.840
 Writing panel, I will use Excel program even 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.250
 You can see how to do this yourself, if you have 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.090
 Excel or any other program dealing with tables 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.380
 We will not use mathematics with it 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.540
 I just want you to realize 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.840
 What it means to match information is with font, or action 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:27.880
 Linear regression 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.550
 So here, let's read the matter 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.550
 The following table shows California's average income 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.190
 - Remember, it's average, average California income - 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.850
 From 1995 to 2002, he said 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.680
 US Bureau of Statistics 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.320
 Draw a graphic representation and find the equation 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.540
 What you expect to be an average annual income 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.370
 For the Californian family in 2010? 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.970
 What are the meanings of slope and y intersection 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:53.580
 In this matter? 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.050
 If the first thing you do - you've copied and 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.060
 Paste the image - we have to get the information in a way 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.920
 Bring them to the table 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.830
 Let's make some tables here 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.800
 Let's set the years from 1995 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.710
 This first column 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.670
 Let us expand it further 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.670
 Let me put the average income 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.100
 This is the average family income in California 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.560
 If we start from one year, or even 0 years 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.100
 1995, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.710
 In fact if you want, I'll find the direction if 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:33.590
 You continue to go down 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.650
 I will find that the increase is by 1 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.340
 Then income, I will copy 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.300
 To prepare here 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:54.710
 $ 53,807, $ 55,217, $ 55,209, $ 55,415 $ 63,100 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:08.680
 $ 63,206, $ 63,761 then we have $ 65,766 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.520
 If I need this here 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.380
 I'll get rid of them 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.810
 I can erase them 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.180
 Let me make sure I have enough numbers 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:24.040
 These are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.570
 6, 7, 8 numbers 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.930
 I want to make sure I got the information correctly. $ 53,807, $ 55,217 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.510
 $ 55,209, 415, 100, 206, 761, 766 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.040
 Well, we'll start 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.880
 Now we will find it in Excel program 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.080
 Incredible ease if you know what you are pressuring 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.430
 First, you set this information, you create a table, and then 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.220
 Better, you create a decline for this information 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.970
 If all you have to do is choose the information 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.480
 Then go to the Insert button, and I will 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.170
 Include the graph option 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.390
 Then you can choose 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.160
 Different types of graphs 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.820
 I want to visualize the data 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:59.670
 We will start 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.470
 He has set the data 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.050
 let's go 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.320
 If you go with this actual income, it is 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.870
 Year starting from 1995 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.570
 If 1995 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.710
 It was $ 53,807 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.370
 In 1996 it was $ 55,217 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.250
 He has set all the data 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.110
 What I want to do now is to fit the line 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.000
 This is not exactly a mistake 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.580
 But let's see, if we assume that the line can represent this 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.500
 The information is fine, I will make the Excel program suit the font 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.580
 What I can have is all these options 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.720
 In order to fit the font in different ways, all 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.710
 These options are different 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:39.780
 I want to choose this 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:40.940
 Maybe you can not see it 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.460
 It appears as a line between points 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.450
 It also has an FX where it illustrates my equation 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.470
 This line 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.520
 If you click on it, we will start 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.570
 It not only fits, but renames the data itself 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.530
 On a different chart 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:55.830
 Let me be a little arrogant 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.430
 . 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:59.930
 No, not to this degree 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.060
 Let me make it a little bigger 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.430
 We can cover the data now, because I think we know 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.410
 what happens 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.460
 Let me cover it that way 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.620
 It does not just assign multiple data points, it's 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.029
 In fact it fits the line with that data and gives me 

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:17.355
 Equation of that line 

00:04:17.355 --> 00:04:21.279
 . 

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:22.975
 Let me see if I can zoom in a bit 

00:04:22.975 --> 00:04:27.330
 . 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.910
 I'll move it away so you can read it at least 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.400
 He explains, that equation is this 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:40.400
 The line is y = 1,882.3x + 52,847 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.250
 If you remember what we know about the inclination 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:50.660
 The intersection of y, the intersection of y is 52,847, which is, if 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.000
 This line was used as a scale, where this line intersects on 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.470
 General 0, or 1995 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.830
 If you use this font as a model, in 1995 the line 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.580
 It would be $ 52,847 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.280
 Actual data were a bit out of this 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.970
 They were slightly higher, $ 53,807 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.250
 It was slightly higher 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.850
 But we try to get as close a line as possible 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:14.980
 Of all such data 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.530
 He tries to minimize the distance 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.470
 Space box, between each of these points 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:20.970
 In line 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.440
 We will not go into math here 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.830
 But it gives us this beautiful equation 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.810
 Now we can use this equation to expect things 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.290
 If we say this is a good data model - let me know 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:31.400
 Drop this down a bit - let's try 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.400
 The answer to the question 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.210
 So we've drawn a graphic representation here - in fact Excel has done it 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.000
 We have created the equation here 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.060
 The question now is, what do you expect to be an average annual income 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.490
 For the California family in 2010? 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:50.010
 If here, we can use the equation given to us 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.770
 This was in 2002 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:52.850
 I can write the year 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:57.240
 This was in 2002 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:02.490
 And 2010 is about 8 years later 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.350
 Let me put a pole here 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.390
 . 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:13.540
 These years 1995, 1996 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.710
 Then the excel program will be able to generate it if you choose these 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.950
 I went to this little button and I get off 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:23.920
 Down, the Excel program is already able to find out I want to 

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.980
 Insert one year at a time 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:31.670
 If I say the years of 1995, again I can continue 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.550
 In this direction here 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.600
 If until 2010 it has been 15 years 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.660
 We can apply this equation 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.760
 Can say that will equal, relative to this 

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.570
 The font - I will read it here, I hope you can read 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:51.000
 What I'm saying - 1,882.3 x x 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.500
 x Here are the years from 1995 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.430
 I can select this box, or I can type 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:59.320
 Number 15 inside 

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.590
 This means Ã— this box, ie x 15 

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:11.390
 Then + 52,847, + this 

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:17.600
 Press the OK button and the prediction is $ 81,081.50 

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.610
 If you complete this line for another 8 years 

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:24.550
 Will expect the average income in California 

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:27.730
 Per family would be $ 81,000 

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.270
 Anyway, I hope you found this presentation enjoyable 

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.340
 The tables are very useful tools 

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.520
 I will give you the meaning of why linear models are considered interesting 

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.130
 Why fonts are important, and how you can use them 

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:42.600
 The tools for interpreting data are probably some conclusion 

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.370
 I am the expectations 

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.450
 This conclusion is using 

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:47.260
 Linear regression 

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:47.333
 .
