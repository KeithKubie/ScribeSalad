involved in any way but I've heard when
you look at the day exactly to your

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:26.320
you look at the day exactly to your
 

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.659
you look at the day exactly to your
point that that was one of the reasons

00:32:27.659 --> 00:32:27.669
point that that was one of the reasons
 

00:32:27.669 --> 00:32:29.669
point that that was one of the reasons
and that was particularly the case

00:32:29.669 --> 00:32:29.679
and that was particularly the case
 

00:32:29.679 --> 00:32:31.680
and that was particularly the case
because it was in the year when Obama

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:31.690
because it was in the year when Obama
 

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:33.330
because it was in the year when Obama
was running and you had a high turnout

00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:33.340
was running and you had a high turnout
 

00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:35.039

amongst those people who sigh Slee
 

00:32:35.049 --> 00:32:37.590
amongst those people who sigh Slee
because you had the first like candidate

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:37.600
because you had the first like candidate
 

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:39.210
because you had the first like candidate
on the ballot for president so he had

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:39.220
on the ballot for president so he had
 

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:41.159
on the ballot for president so he had
more black people voting and that was

00:32:41.159 --> 00:32:41.169
more black people voting and that was
 

00:32:41.169 --> 00:32:45.210
more black people voting and that was
one of the consequences yes % I don't

one of the consequences yes % I don't
 

00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:46.109
one of the consequences yes % I don't

00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:53.910
community where everyone knows each
 

00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:56.359
community where everyone knows each
other right where the decisions are made

00:37:56.359 --> 00:37:56.369
other right where the decisions are made
 

00:37:56.369 --> 00:37:58.249
other right where the decisions are made
kind of by people who can look the other

00:37:58.249 --> 00:37:58.259
kind of by people who can look the other
 

00:37:58.259 --> 00:38:00.140
kind of by people who can look the other
person in the eye and all that I think

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:00.150
person in the eye and all that I think
 

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:01.189
person in the eye and all that I think
they're gonna be better I think one of

00:38:01.189 --> 00:38:01.199
they're gonna be better I think one of
 

00:38:01.199 --> 00:38:02.900
they're gonna be better I think one of
the problems is that you've got these

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:02.910
the problems is that you've got these
 

00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:05.209
the problems is that you've got these
big big systems and they're they're

00:38:05.209 --> 00:38:05.219
big big systems and they're they're
 

00:38:05.219 --> 00:38:06.799
big big systems and they're they're
they're kind of really far from the

00:38:06.799 --> 00:38:06.809
they're kind of really far from the
 

00:38:06.809 --> 00:38:09.380
they're kind of really far from the
human level where that kind of trust can

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:09.390
human level where that kind of trust can
 

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:11.089
human level where that kind of trust can
be established and that is one of the

00:38:11.089 --> 00:38:11.099
be established and that is one of the
 

00:38:11.099 --> 00:38:13.249
be established and that is one of the
problems with with a lot of things in

00:38:13.249 --> 00:38:13.259
problems with with a lot of things in
 

00:38:13.259 --> 00:38:14.839
problems with with a lot of things in
government and politics it's all just

00:38:14.839 --> 00:38:14.849
government and politics it's all just
 

00:38:14.849 --> 00:38:17.179
government and politics it's all just
too big and removed from that human

00:38:17.179 --> 00:38:17.189
too big and removed from that human
 

00:38:17.189 --> 00:38:19.249
too big and removed from that human
scale well that's a problem with a lot

00:38:19.249 --> 00:38:19.259
scale well that's a problem with a lot
 

00:38:19.259 --> 00:38:20.809
scale well that's a problem with a lot
of things when it comes to human beings

00:38:20.809 --> 00:38:20.819
of things when it comes to human beings
 

00:38:20.819 --> 00:38:22.999
of things when it comes to human beings
just diffusion of responsibility that

00:38:22.999 --> 00:38:23.009
just diffusion of responsibility that
 

00:38:23.009 --> 00:38:25.099
just diffusion of responsibility that
comes with being a part of a massive

00:38:25.099 --> 00:38:25.109
comes with being a part of a massive
 

00:38:25.109 --> 00:38:28.939
comes with being a part of a massive
group like war yeah the idea that if

00:38:28.939 --> 00:38:28.949
group like war yeah the idea that if
 

00:38:28.949 --> 00:38:31.429
group like war yeah the idea that if
there's 300 million of us and a million

00:38:31.429 --> 00:38:31.439
there's 300 million of us and a million
 

00:38:31.439 --> 00:38:34.039
there's 300 million of us and a million
of us are overseas you know fighting for

00:38:34.039 --> 00:38:34.049
of us are overseas you know fighting for
 

00:38:34.049 --> 00:38:37.429
of us are overseas you know fighting for
freedom that's sort of like you you

00:38:37.429 --> 00:38:37.439
freedom that's sort of like you you
 

00:38:37.439 --> 00:38:38.630
freedom that's sort of like you you
could deal with that because it's not

00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640
could deal with that because it's not
 

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:41.089
could deal with that because it's not
happening in calabasas you know you can

00:38:41.089 --> 00:38:41.099
happening in calabasas you know you can
 

00:38:41.099 --> 00:38:43.279
happening in calabasas you know you can
go to work and you could deal with your

00:38:43.279 --> 00:38:43.289
go to work and you could deal with your
 

00:38:43.289 --> 00:38:45.979
go to work and you could deal with your
life and in your the scope of your world

00:38:45.979 --> 00:38:45.989
life and in your the scope of your world
 

00:38:45.989 --> 00:38:48.529
life and in your the scope of your world
it doesn't come up but you kind of

00:38:48.529 --> 00:38:48.539
it doesn't come up but you kind of
 

00:38:48.539 --> 00:38:50.359
it doesn't come up but you kind of
peripherally aware that this is

00:38:50.359 --> 00:38:50.369
peripherally aware that this is
 

00:38:50.369 --> 00:38:52.429
peripherally aware that this is
happening somewhere else but if people

00:38:52.429 --> 00:38:52.439
happening somewhere else but if people
 

00:38:52.439 --> 00:38:54.319
happening somewhere else but if people
in van nuys were going to war with

00:38:54.319 --> 00:38:54.329
in van nuys were going to war with
 

00:38:54.329 --> 00:38:56.390
in van nuys were going to war with
people in Studio City and it was only a

00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:56.400
people in Studio City and it was only a
 

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:57.949
people in Studio City and it was only a
couple miles away and you had to deal

00:38:57.949 --> 00:38:57.959
couple miles away and you had to deal
 

00:38:57.959 --> 00:38:59.719
couple miles away and you had to deal
with that then it would be something we

00:38:59.719 --> 00:38:59.729
with that then it would be something we
 

00:38:59.729 --> 00:39:01.609
with that then it would be something we
would have to try to calm down

00:39:01.609 --> 00:39:01.619
would have to try to calm down
 

00:39:01.619 --> 00:39:03.079
would have to try to calm down
we'd have to try to deal with this like

00:39:03.079 --> 00:39:03.089
we'd have to try to deal with this like
 

00:39:03.089 --> 00:39:04.849
we'd have to try to deal with this like
what what's fuck's going on here like

00:39:04.849 --> 00:39:04.859
what what's fuck's going on here like
 

00:39:04.859 --> 00:39:06.650
what what's fuck's going on here like
what are we doing here we'd have to it's

00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:06.660
what are we doing here we'd have to it's
 

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:08.539
what are we doing here we'd have to it's
it's something you have to deal with but

00:39:08.539 --> 00:39:08.549
it's something you have to deal with but
 

00:39:08.549 --> 00:39:10.880
it's something you have to deal with but
the the sheer number of human beings

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:10.890
the the sheer number of human beings
 

00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:12.410
the the sheer number of human beings
that are involved in the world today in

00:39:12.410 --> 00:39:12.420
that are involved in the world today in
 

00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:14.689
that are involved in the world today in
communities and cultures it's just it's

00:39:14.689 --> 00:39:14.699
communities and cultures it's just it's
 

00:39:14.699 --> 00:39:16.910
communities and cultures it's just it's
almost unmanageable so I manageable for

00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:16.920
almost unmanageable so I manageable for
 

00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:18.829
almost unmanageable so I manageable for
a person who's not designed for that

00:39:18.829 --> 00:39:18.839
a person who's not designed for that
 

00:39:18.839 --> 00:39:20.630
a person who's not designed for that
we're designed essentially to deal with

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:20.640
we're designed essentially to deal with
 

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:22.669
we're designed essentially to deal with
our immediate atmosphere we're designed

00:39:22.669 --> 00:39:22.679
our immediate atmosphere we're designed
 

00:39:22.679 --> 00:39:24.130
our immediate atmosphere we're designed
to deal with small tribes of people

00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:24.140
to deal with small tribes of people
 

00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:26.719
to deal with small tribes of people
friends family the people that you know

00:39:26.719 --> 00:39:26.729
friends family the people that you know
 

00:39:26.729 --> 00:39:28.519
friends family the people that you know
the people that you keep close and when

00:39:28.519 --> 00:39:28.529
the people that you keep close and when
 

00:39:28.529 --> 00:39:30.349
the people that you keep close and when
you get past that it's just like almost

00:39:30.349 --> 00:39:30.359
you get past that it's just like almost
 

00:39:30.359 --> 00:39:31.849
you get past that it's just like almost
like what do we I don't know what to do

00:39:31.849 --> 00:39:31.859
like what do we I don't know what to do
 

00:39:31.859 --> 00:39:34.009
like what do we I don't know what to do
with this and so we pass the buck off to

00:39:34.009 --> 00:39:34.019
with this and so we pass the buck off to
 

00:39:34.019 --> 00:39:35.839
with this and so we pass the buck off to
some representative I think this is such

00:39:35.839 --> 00:39:35.849
some representative I think this is such
 

00:39:35.849 --> 00:39:37.489
some representative I think this is such
an important point I really do believe

00:39:37.489 --> 00:39:37.499
an important point I really do believe
 

00:39:37.499 --> 00:39:40.339
an important point I really do believe
that I think that so many things don't

00:39:40.339 --> 00:39:40.349
that I think that so many things don't
 

00:39:40.349 --> 00:39:42.799
that I think that so many things don't
work because they get away from the

00:39:42.799 --> 00:39:42.809
work because they get away from the
 

00:39:42.809 --> 00:39:44.059
work because they get away from the
point where you can really know the

00:39:44.059 --> 00:39:44.069
point where you can really know the
 

00:39:44.069 --> 00:39:45.559
point where you can really know the
other person and all the other group

00:39:45.559 --> 00:39:45.569
other person and all the other group
 

00:39:45.569 --> 00:39:46.819
other person and all the other group
that you're with there's some guy in

00:39:46.819 --> 00:39:46.829
that you're with there's some guy in
 

00:39:46.829 --> 00:39:48.679
that you're with there's some guy in
England that I think at Cambridge

00:39:48.679 --> 00:39:48.689
England that I think at Cambridge
 

00:39:48.689 --> 00:39:50.959
England that I think at Cambridge
University it's some research about the

00:39:50.959 --> 00:39:50.969
University it's some research about the
 

00:39:50.969 --> 00:39:52.309
University it's some research about the
maximum number of people that you can

00:39:52.309 --> 00:39:52.319
maximum number of people that you can
 

00:39:52.319 --> 00:39:54.589
maximum number of people that you can
really have any kind of human

00:39:54.589 --> 00:39:54.599
really have any kind of human
 

00:39:54.599 --> 00:39:55.849
really have any kind of human
relationship with at any one time I

00:39:55.849 --> 00:39:55.859
relationship with at any one time I
 

00:39:55.859 --> 00:39:57.859
relationship with at any one time I
think you got to a number 150 Dunbar's

00:39:57.859 --> 00:39:57.869
think you got to a number 150 Dunbar's
 

00:39:57.869 --> 00:39:59.190
think you got to a number 150 Dunbar's
number is that is that right

00:39:59.190 --> 00:39:59.200
number is that is that right
 

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.450
number is that is that right
so yeah and all about it than I do I

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:00.460
so yeah and all about it than I do I
 

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:01.410
so yeah and all about it than I do I
thought that was just a really

00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:01.420
thought that was just a really
 

00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:03.900
thought that was just a really
interesting perspective on it which yeah

00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:03.910
interesting perspective on it which yeah
 

00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:07.079
interesting perspective on it which yeah
which is that after that it just gets to

00:40:07.079 --> 00:40:07.089
which is that after that it just gets to
 

00:40:07.089 --> 00:40:08.910
which is that after that it just gets to
diffuse we're not designed for it's like

00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:08.920
diffuse we're not designed for it's like
 

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:10.859
diffuse we're not designed for it's like
your phone your phones only has a

00:40:10.859 --> 00:40:10.869
your phone your phones only has a
 

00:40:10.869 --> 00:40:12.660
your phone your phones only has a
certain amount of data that old fucking

00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:12.670
certain amount of data that old fucking
 

00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:14.220
certain amount of data that old fucking
goofy flip phone you carry around with

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:14.230
goofy flip phone you carry around with
 

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:16.319
goofy flip phone you carry around with
you if you have an older one like one of

00:40:16.319 --> 00:40:16.329
you if you have an older one like one of
 

00:40:16.329 --> 00:40:17.819
you if you have an older one like one of
those Motorola StarTAC s--

00:40:17.819 --> 00:40:17.829
those Motorola StarTAC s--
 

00:40:17.829 --> 00:40:19.319
those Motorola StarTAC s--
you know remember those from back in the

00:40:19.319 --> 00:40:19.329
you know remember those from back in the
 

00:40:19.329 --> 00:40:21.960
you know remember those from back in the
day big fuckin goofy clunky thing I mean

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:21.970
day big fuckin goofy clunky thing I mean
 

00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:23.520
day big fuckin goofy clunky thing I mean
that probably only carried 100 phone

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:23.530
that probably only carried 100 phone
 

00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:25.500
that probably only carried 100 phone
numbers yeah I don't know how many they

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:25.510
numbers yeah I don't know how many they
 

00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:27.599
numbers yeah I don't know how many they
had but that the amount of data that you

00:40:27.599 --> 00:40:27.609
had but that the amount of data that you
 

00:40:27.609 --> 00:40:29.790
had but that the amount of data that you
can store new devices represents the

00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:29.800
can store new devices represents the
 

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:32.940
can store new devices represents the
need that we have but we have these same

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:32.950
need that we have but we have these same
 

00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:36.900
need that we have but we have these same
biological hard drives that cavemen did

00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:36.910
biological hard drives that cavemen did
 

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:38.430
biological hard drives that cavemen did
I mean they're not really much different

00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:38.440
I mean they're not really much different
 

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.410
I mean they're not really much different
than people that lived a million years

00:40:40.410 --> 00:40:40.420
than people that lived a million years
 

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:42.720
than people that lived a million years
ago I mean how much it has it changed I

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:42.730
ago I mean how much it has it changed I
 

00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:44.700
ago I mean how much it has it changed I
mean how many how many how much more

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:44.710
mean how many how many how much more
 

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:47.099
mean how many how many how much more
room do we have for social relationships

00:40:47.099 --> 00:40:47.109
room do we have for social relationships
 

00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:49.800
room do we have for social relationships
apparently not much like fifty thousand

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:49.810
apparently not much like fifty thousand
 

00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:51.180
apparently not much like fifty thousand
years ago and today if you could took a

00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:51.190
years ago and today if you could took a
 

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:53.640
years ago and today if you could took a
guy who lived fifty thousand years ago

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:53.650

this kind of everything becoming really
 

00:41:31.329 --> 00:41:33.900
this kind of everything becoming really
kind of organized this sort of inhuman

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:33.910
kind of organized this sort of inhuman
 

00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:36.480
kind of organized this sort of inhuman
level and this mad struggle to sort of

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:36.490
level and this mad struggle to sort of
 

00:41:36.490 --> 00:41:40.920

organize it and to try to control it and
 

00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:44.280
organize it and to try to control it and
just just calm it down get a handle on

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:44.290
just just calm it down get a handle on
 

00:41:44.290 --> 00:41:47.490
just just calm it down get a handle on
the effects of it and I think in a lot

00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:47.500
the effects of it and I think in a lot
 

00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:49.500
the effects of it and I think in a lot
of ways that's what you're doing with

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:49.510
of ways that's what you're doing with
 

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:51.720
of ways that's what you're doing with
this crowd packed thing with this crowd

00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:51.730
this crowd packed thing with this crowd
 

00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:55.710
this crowd packed thing with this crowd
packed thing is you are utilising these

00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:55.720
packed thing is you are utilising these
 

00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:57.780
packed thing is you are utilising these
tools these tools of the internet and

00:41:57.780 --> 00:41:57.790
tools these tools of the internet and
 

00:41:57.790 --> 00:41:59.520
tools these tools of the internet and
this instant access to information that

00:41:59.520 --> 00:41:59.530
this instant access to information that
 

00:41:59.530 --> 00:42:02.550
this instant access to information that
we have today to sort of establish a

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:02.560
we have today to sort of establish a
 

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:06.059
we have today to sort of establish a
much clearer sense of where political

00:42:06.059 --> 00:42:06.069
much clearer sense of where political
 

00:42:06.069 --> 00:42:08.190
much clearer sense of where political
candidates are coming from and what are

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:08.200
candidates are coming from and what are
 

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:10.319
candidates are coming from and what are
their influences as far as who is

00:42:10.319 --> 00:42:10.329
their influences as far as who is
 

00:42:10.329 --> 00:42:11.970
their influences as far as who is
financing them

00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:11.980
financing them
 

00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:14.610
financing them
where is you know where's their money

00:42:14.610 --> 00:42:14.620
where is you know where's their money
 

00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:16.650
where is you know where's their money
coming from where are their decisions

00:42:16.650 --> 00:42:16.660
coming from where are their decisions
 

00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:19.080
coming from where are their decisions
headed towards what what are they what

00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:19.090
headed towards what what are they what
 

00:42:19.090 --> 00:42:20.640
headed towards what what are they what
are they doing right now yeah I think

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:20.650
are they doing right now yeah I think
 

00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:22.680
are they doing right now yeah I think
that's that's a really good summary of

00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:22.690
that's that's a really good summary of
 

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:24.630
that's that's a really good summary of
it which is that basically we think that

00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:24.640
it which is that basically we think that
 

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:26.160
it which is that basically we think that
what we when you talk to people about

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:26.170
what we when you talk to people about
 

00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:27.600
what we when you talk to people about
politics one of the things they say is

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:27.610
politics one of the things they say is
 

00:42:27.610 --> 00:42:29.400
politics one of the things they say is
that we just don't know enough about it

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:29.410
that we just don't know enough about it
 

00:42:29.410 --> 00:42:31.830
that we just don't know enough about it
we don't know enough information

00:42:31.830 --> 00:42:31.840
we don't know enough information
 

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:33.690
we don't know enough information
generally but we don't know we don't

00:42:33.690 --> 00:42:33.700
generally but we don't know we don't
 

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:35.580
generally but we don't know we don't
have information we can trust we have

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:35.590
have information we can trust we have
 

00:42:35.590 --> 00:42:37.410
have information we can trust we have
all this spin and ads and all the rest

00:42:37.410 --> 00:42:37.420
all this spin and ads and all the rest
 

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:38.580
all this spin and ads and all the rest
of it from the politicians we can't

00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:38.590
of it from the politicians we can't
 

00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:40.200
of it from the politicians we can't
really believe them there's all this

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:40.210
really believe them there's all this
 

00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:41.520
really believe them there's all this
stuff around on the Internet I don't

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:41.530
stuff around on the Internet I don't
 

00:42:41.530 --> 00:42:43.500
stuff around on the Internet I don't
know what to believe so what we're

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:43.510
know what to believe so what we're
 

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:44.850
know what to believe so what we're
trying to do is give people really

00:42:44.850 --> 00:42:44.860
trying to do is give people really
 

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:47.550
trying to do is give people really
objective information that they can rely

00:42:47.550 --> 00:42:47.560
objective information that they can rely
 

00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:50.220
objective information that they can rely
on to figure out where the politicians

00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:50.230
on to figure out where the politicians
 

00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:52.350
on to figure out where the politicians
are on the issues that they care about

00:42:52.350 --> 00:42:52.360
are on the issues that they care about
 

00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:54.180
are on the issues that they care about
and the thing that we found from our

00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:54.190
and the thing that we found from our
 

00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:57.600
and the thing that we found from our
research is that as my um one of my

00:42:57.600 --> 00:42:57.610
research is that as my um one of my
 

00:42:57.610 --> 00:42:59.190
research is that as my um one of my
co-founders Adam who's a professor at

00:42:59.190 --> 00:42:59.200
co-founders Adam who's a professor at
 

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:01.980
co-founders Adam who's a professor at
Stanford has been working on this for

00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:01.990
Stanford has been working on this for
 

00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:04.920
Stanford has been working on this for
many years and basically what he's shown

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:04.930
many years and basically what he's shown
 

00:43:04.930 --> 00:43:08.400
many years and basically what he's shown
is that the best way to predict what a

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:08.410
is that the best way to predict what a
 

00:43:08.410 --> 00:43:10.680
is that the best way to predict what a
politician will do if they're elected is

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:10.690
politician will do if they're elected is
 

00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:12.240
politician will do if they're elected is
to look at where they get their money

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:12.250
to look at where they get their money
 

00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:14.520
to look at where they get their money
and to look at also who they give money

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:14.530
and to look at also who they give money
 

00:43:14.530 --> 00:43:16.860
and to look at also who they give money
to because most politicians also kind of

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:16.870
to because most politicians also kind of
 

00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:18.210
to because most politicians also kind of
donate to other candidates so if you

00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:18.220
donate to other candidates so if you
 

00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:19.950
donate to other candidates so if you
look at all that campaign finance

00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:19.960
look at all that campaign finance
 

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:22.470
look at all that campaign finance
information the money behind this

00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:22.480
information the money behind this
 

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:24.660
information the money behind this
politician that is going to give you the

00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:24.670
politician that is going to give you the
 

00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:26.580
politician that is going to give you the
best guide to what they're really going

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:26.590
best guide to what they're really going
 

00:43:26.590 --> 00:43:28.980
best guide to what they're really going
to do in office and it's something that

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:28.990
to do in office and it's something that
 

00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:30.270
to do in office and it's something that
you can actually what we're trying to

00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:30.280
you can actually what we're trying to
 

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:32.730
you can actually what we're trying to
use like turn that into really simple

00:43:32.730 --> 00:43:32.740
use like turn that into really simple
 

00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:35.760
use like turn that into really simple
information that you can without kind of

00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:35.770
information that you can without kind of
 

00:43:35.770 --> 00:43:37.650
information that you can without kind of
reading tons of stuff and doing loads of

00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:37.660
reading tons of stuff and doing loads of
 

00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:39.470
reading tons of stuff and doing loads of
research you can get a quick snapshot of

00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:39.480
research you can get a quick snapshot of
 

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:42.330
research you can get a quick snapshot of
who these people are and then in time

00:43:42.330 --> 00:43:42.340
who these people are and then in time
 

00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:43.710
who these people are and then in time
the other thing we want to do is make it

00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:43.720
the other thing we want to do is make it
 

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:46.530
the other thing we want to do is make it
possible for you to find the politicians

00:43:46.530 --> 00:43:46.540
possible for you to find the politicians
 

00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:49.890
possible for you to find the politicians
that are really good or bad on the

00:43:49.890 --> 00:43:49.900
that are really good or bad on the
 

00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:51.720
that are really good or bad on the
issues that you care about and get

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:51.730
issues that you care about and get
 

00:43:51.730 --> 00:43:53.100
issues that you care about and get
involved in their campaigns because the

00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:53.110
involved in their campaigns because the
 

00:43:53.110 --> 00:43:54.930
involved in their campaigns because the
other thing is that you've got a tiny

00:43:54.930 --> 00:43:54.940
other thing is that you've got a tiny
 

00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:57.210
other thing is that you've got a tiny
tiny number of people who are funding

00:43:57.210 --> 00:43:57.220
tiny number of people who are funding
 

00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:59.310
tiny number of people who are funding
all these campaigns if you look at the

00:43:59.310 --> 00:43:59.320
all these campaigns if you look at the
 

00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:01.380
all these campaigns if you look at the
the total number of people who put money

00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:01.390
the total number of people who put money
 

00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:03.870
the total number of people who put money
into politics it's a really small number

00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:03.880
into politics it's a really small number
 

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:05.100
into politics it's a really small number
compared to the number of people who

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:05.110
compared to the number of people who
 

00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:07.260
compared to the number of people who
vote and then the number of adults in

00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:07.270
vote and then the number of adults in
 

00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:07.920
vote and then the number of adults in
the whole country

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:07.930
the whole country
 

00:44:07.930 --> 00:44:10.200
the whole country
it's a tiny number that are funding it

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:10.210

00:45:09.579 --> 00:45:11.759
developed because what it means is that
you've got the special interests and

00:45:11.759 --> 00:45:11.769
you've got the special interests and
 

00:45:11.769 --> 00:45:13.259
you've got the special interests and
whether that's left or right it doesn't

whether that's left or right it doesn't
 

00:45:13.269 --> 00:45:14.519
whether that's left or right it doesn't

particular outcome and they're buying it
through the system so we've got to get

00:45:19.529 --> 00:45:19.539
through the system so we've got to get
 

00:45:19.539 --> 00:45:21.569

that is kind of a noble aim I guess but
 

00:45:30.279 --> 00:45:33.239
that is kind of a noble aim I guess but
my feeling is that that's a really hard

00:45:33.239 --> 00:45:33.249
my feeling is that that's a really hard

politicians and so our take on it is to
 

00:45:46.089 --> 00:45:48.329
politicians and so our take on it is to
say well if you can't take the money out

00:45:48.329 --> 00:45:48.339

experiments that happened was in Holland

00:57:31.650 --> 00:57:31.660
experiments that happened was in Holland
 

00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:34.680
experiments that happened was in Holland
I think I've got that right in in in

00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:34.690
I think I've got that right in in in
 

00:57:34.690 --> 00:57:36.569
I think I've got that right in in in
Europe and they did this brilliant

00:57:36.569 --> 00:57:36.579
Europe and they did this brilliant
 

00:57:36.579 --> 00:57:40.650
Europe and they did this brilliant
experiment with traffic where they in a

00:57:40.650 --> 00:57:40.660
experiment with traffic where they in a
 

00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:42.480
experiment with traffic where they in a
town I think it was Friesland or

00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:42.490
town I think it was Friesland or
 

00:57:42.490 --> 00:57:43.559
town I think it was Friesland or
something like that probably got that

00:57:43.559 --> 00:57:43.569
something like that probably got that
 

00:57:43.569 --> 00:57:46.710
something like that probably got that
wrong where they literally took away all

00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:46.720
wrong where they literally took away all
 

00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:48.210
wrong where they literally took away all
the traffic so

00:57:48.210 --> 00:57:48.220
the traffic so
 

00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:50.099
the traffic so
all of them everything right they took

00:57:50.099 --> 00:57:50.109
all of them everything right they took
 

00:57:50.109 --> 00:57:52.859
all of them everything right they took
away traffic lights they even took it we

00:57:52.859 --> 00:57:52.869
away traffic lights they even took it we
 

00:57:52.869 --> 00:57:55.230
away traffic lights they even took it we
know stop signs everything even the the

00:57:55.230 --> 00:57:55.240
know stop signs everything even the the
 

00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:56.579
know stop signs everything even the the
markings on the road so they took away

00:57:56.579 --> 00:57:56.589
markings on the road so they took away
 

00:57:56.589 --> 00:57:58.079
markings on the road so they took away
the white line in the middle of the road

00:57:58.079 --> 00:57:58.089
the white line in the middle of the road
 

00:57:58.089 --> 00:58:01.170
the white line in the middle of the road
everything all gone and their theory was

00:58:01.170 --> 00:58:01.180
everything all gone and their theory was
 

00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:04.950
everything all gone and their theory was
that without that kind of external rule

00:58:04.950 --> 00:58:04.960
that without that kind of external rule
 

00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:07.859
that without that kind of external rule
making and kind of stuff going on to

00:58:07.859 --> 00:58:07.869
making and kind of stuff going on to
 

00:58:07.869 --> 00:58:09.900

tell you what to do people would have to

00:58:09.900 --> 00:58:09.910
tell you what to do people would have to
 

00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:12.120
tell you what to do people would have to
kind of relate to each other as other

00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:12.130
kind of relate to each other as other
 

00:58:12.130 --> 00:58:14.250
kind of relate to each other as other
people and just figure it out amongst

00:58:14.250 --> 00:58:14.260
people and just figure it out amongst
 

00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:18.150
people and just figure it out amongst
themselves so they would you know have

00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:18.160
themselves so they would you know have
 

00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:20.609
themselves so they would you know have
to look other people in the eye and and

00:58:20.609 --> 00:58:20.619
to look other people in the eye and and
 

00:58:20.619 --> 00:58:22.410
to look other people in the eye and and
sort of work it out between them and

00:58:22.410 --> 00:58:22.420
sort of work it out between them and
 

00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:23.910
sort of work it out between them and
they found they had this brilliant

00:58:23.910 --> 00:58:23.920
they found they had this brilliant
 

00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:27.210
they found they had this brilliant
effect which was that accidents fell to

00:58:27.210 --> 00:58:27.220
effect which was that accidents fell to
 

00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:30.480
effect which was that accidents fell to
zero the traffic improved the traffic

00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:30.490
zero the traffic improved the traffic
 

00:58:30.490 --> 00:58:32.819
zero the traffic improved the traffic
speed was lower but the traffic flow was

00:58:32.819 --> 00:58:32.829
speed was lower but the traffic flow was
 

00:58:32.829 --> 00:58:35.250
speed was lower but the traffic flow was
much better it just worked all around

00:58:35.250 --> 00:58:35.260
much better it just worked all around
 

00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:36.599
much better it just worked all around
all the kind of things that you try and

00:58:36.599 --> 00:58:36.609
all the kind of things that you try and
 

00:58:36.609 --> 00:58:38.819
all the kind of things that you try and
do when all these people thinking about

00:58:38.819 --> 00:58:38.829
do when all these people thinking about
 

00:58:38.829 --> 00:58:41.009
do when all these people thinking about
traffic planning and whatever they

00:58:41.009 --> 00:58:41.019
traffic planning and whatever they
 

00:58:41.019 --> 00:58:42.690
traffic planning and whatever they
achieved all those aims by literally

00:58:42.690 --> 00:58:42.700
achieved all those aims by literally
 

00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:44.579
achieved all those aims by literally
taking everything away and just allowing

00:58:44.579 --> 00:58:44.589
taking everything away and just allowing
 

00:58:44.589 --> 00:58:46.950
taking everything away and just allowing
people to relate to each other as humans

00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:46.960
people to relate to each other as humans
 

00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:51.120
people to relate to each other as humans
and I thought it's such a great little

00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:51.130
and I thought it's such a great little
 

00:58:51.130 --> 00:58:53.220
and I thought it's such a great little
story and I think that you could do that

00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:53.230
story and I think that you could do that
 

00:58:53.230 --> 00:58:55.559
story and I think that you could do that
in all sorts of areas if you just leave

00:58:55.559 --> 00:58:55.569
in all sorts of areas if you just leave
 

00:58:55.569 --> 00:58:57.120
in all sorts of areas if you just leave
it to people to figure out on a small

00:58:57.120 --> 00:58:57.130
it to people to figure out on a small
 

00:58:57.130 --> 00:58:58.799
it to people to figure out on a small
scale where they can relate to each

00:58:58.799 --> 00:58:58.809
scale where they can relate to each
 

00:58:58.809 --> 00:58:59.130

you just get a much better result isn't

00:59:01.230 --> 00:59:01.240
you just get a much better result isn't
 

00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:02.910
you just get a much better result isn't
that the issue though the small scale

00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:02.920
that the issue though the small scale

less human than a light a stop light red
 

00:59:49.329 --> 00:59:54.180
less human than a light a stop light red
means stop green means go wait look at

00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:54.190
means stop green means go wait look at
 

00:59:54.190 --> 00:59:57.319
means stop green means go wait look at
it it's green go I mean it's so

00:59:57.319 --> 00:59:57.329
it it's green go I mean it's so
 

00:59:57.329 --> 01:00:00.420

disconnected yeah from human interaction

01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:00.430
disconnected yeah from human interaction

there's no better chance that you're
gonna run into a traffic stop or a

gonna run into a traffic stop or a

gonna run into a traffic stop or a
traffic jam then if a cop is directing

that intersection up sideways every time

01:00:20.490 --> 01:00:20.500
that intersection up sideways every time
 

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:22.049
that intersection up sideways every time
I go into one of those situations where

01:00:22.049 --> 01:00:22.059
I go into one of those situations where
 

01:00:22.059 --> 01:00:23.700
I go into one of those situations where
a light is down and there's a cop

01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:23.710
a light is down and there's a cop
 

01:00:23.710 --> 01:00:26.069
a light is down and there's a cop
standing there it's a fucking disaster

01:00:26.069 --> 01:00:26.079
standing there it's a fucking disaster
 

01:00:26.079 --> 01:00:28.380
standing there it's a fucking disaster
whereas if it was just a light it's just

01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:28.390
whereas if it was just a light it's just
 

01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:30.690
whereas if it was just a light it's just
red light green light everything seems

01:00:30.690 --> 01:00:30.700
red light green light everything seems
 

01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:32.309
red light green light everything seems
to work because we're sort of programmed

01:00:32.309 --> 01:00:32.319
to work because we're sort of programmed
 

01:00:32.319 --> 01:00:34.380
to work because we're sort of programmed
to wait for that light and like you just

01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:34.390
to wait for that light and like you just
 

01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:36.180
to wait for that light and like you just
yeah you can follow that if that cop is

01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:36.190
yeah you can follow that if that cop is
 

01:00:36.190 --> 01:00:38.430
yeah you can follow that if that cop is
there like oh this motherfucker look at

that's where we're at when it comes to a
 

01:03:30.549 --> 01:03:33.059
that's where we're at when it comes to a
lot of these propositions and a lot of

lot of these propositions and a lot of
 

01:03:33.069 --> 01:03:36.029

few alternatives yeah I think that the
thing that happens then is that they've

01:03:54.829 --> 01:03:54.839
thing that happens then is that they've
 

01:03:54.839 --> 01:03:57.630
thing that happens then is that they've
complicated it then it's not working and

01:03:57.630 --> 01:03:57.640
complicated it then it's not working and
 

01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:58.739
complicated it then it's not working and
they say oh we could better try and fix

01:03:58.739 --> 01:03:58.749
they say oh we could better try and fix
 

01:03:58.749 --> 01:04:00.599
they say oh we could better try and fix
it and then the the fixing of it makes

01:04:00.599 --> 01:04:00.609
it and then the the fixing of it makes
 

01:04:00.609 --> 01:04:02.579
it and then the the fixing of it makes
it even more complicated and it's just

01:04:02.579 --> 01:04:02.589
it even more complicated and it's just
 

01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:03.839
it even more complicated and it's just
getting there and then a new government

01:04:03.839 --> 01:04:03.849
getting there and then a new government
 

01:04:03.849 --> 01:04:05.430
getting there and then a new government
comes in or a new governor or whoever it

01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:05.440
comes in or a new governor or whoever it
 

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:07.349
comes in or a new governor or whoever it
may be and and instead of actually just

01:04:07.349 --> 01:04:07.359
may be and and instead of actually just
 

01:04:07.359 --> 01:04:08.370
may be and and instead of actually just
stopping and thinking you know what this

01:04:08.370 --> 01:04:08.380
stopping and thinking you know what this
 

01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:09.749
stopping and thinking you know what this
hot we just got to rethink the whole

01:04:09.749 --> 01:04:09.759
hot we just got to rethink the whole
 

01:04:09.759 --> 01:04:13.410
hot we just got to rethink the whole
thing and start from scratch and and

01:04:13.410 --> 01:04:13.420
thing and start from scratch and and
 

01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:15.989
thing and start from scratch and and
just not tinker with it anymore and try

01:04:15.989 --> 01:04:15.999
just not tinker with it anymore and try
 

01:04:15.999 --> 01:04:17.279
just not tinker with it anymore and try
and improve it because it's just gonna

01:04:17.279 --> 01:04:17.289
and improve it because it's just gonna
 

01:04:17.289 --> 01:04:19.140
and improve it because it's just gonna
make it more complicated that never

01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:19.150
make it more complicated that never
 

01:04:19.150 --> 01:04:21.120
make it more complicated that never
happens there's never really enough time

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:21.130
happens there's never really enough time
 

01:04:21.130 --> 01:04:22.559
happens there's never really enough time
for that to happen they're not there

01:04:22.559 --> 01:04:22.569
for that to happen they're not there
 

01:04:22.569 --> 01:04:23.729
for that to happen they're not there
they're only thinking about the next

01:04:23.729 --> 01:04:23.739
they're only thinking about the next
 

01:04:23.739 --> 01:04:25.200
they're only thinking about the next
couple of years in the next election or

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:25.210
couple of years in the next election or
 

01:04:25.210 --> 01:04:25.670
couple of years in the next election or
whatever

01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:25.680
whatever
 

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:28.819
whatever
and so things just get even more

01:04:28.819 --> 01:04:28.829
and so things just get even more
 

01:04:28.829 --> 01:04:31.519
and so things just get even more
complicated never they never seem to get

01:04:31.519 --> 01:04:31.529
complicated never they never seem to get
 

01:04:31.529 --> 01:04:33.620
complicated never they never seem to get
to that point weapon yeah that's really

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:33.630
to that point weapon yeah that's really
 

01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:35.390
to that point weapon yeah that's really
working great now my wife and I went out

01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:35.400
working great now my wife and I went out
 

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:36.739
working great now my wife and I went out
to this restaurant the other night and

01:04:36.739 --> 01:04:36.749
to this restaurant the other night and
 

01:04:36.749 --> 01:04:39.109
to this restaurant the other night and
the the restaurant was this we were

01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119
the the restaurant was this we were
 

01:04:39.119 --> 01:04:40.730
the the restaurant was this we were
noticing that there's this theme that's

01:04:40.730 --> 01:04:40.740
noticing that there's this theme that's
 

01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:42.799
noticing that there's this theme that's
going on and a lot of restaurants where

01:04:42.799 --> 01:04:42.809
going on and a lot of restaurants where
 

01:04:42.809 --> 01:04:45.140
going on and a lot of restaurants where
they have like this rustic thing going

01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:45.150
they have like this rustic thing going
 

01:04:45.150 --> 01:04:47.630
they have like this rustic thing going
on where they have old-school lights the

01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:47.640
on where they have old-school lights the
 

01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:49.249
on where they have old-school lights the
filaments in them and then they have

01:04:49.249 --> 01:04:49.259
filaments in them and then they have
 

01:04:49.259 --> 01:04:52.009
filaments in them and then they have
hardwood tables and wrought iron this

01:04:52.009 --> 01:04:52.019
hardwood tables and wrought iron this
 

01:04:52.019 --> 01:04:54.620
hardwood tables and wrought iron this
and metal that and and I was like I

01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:54.630
and metal that and and I was like I
 

01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:57.259
and metal that and and I was like I
think people are sort of reacting to

01:04:57.259 --> 01:04:57.269
think people are sort of reacting to
 

01:04:57.269 --> 01:04:59.450
think people are sort of reacting to
this fabricated world that we've created

01:04:59.450 --> 01:04:59.460
this fabricated world that we've created
 

01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:02.390
this fabricated world that we've created
and we long for this simplicity that's

01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:02.400
and we long for this simplicity that's
 

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:05.269
and we long for this simplicity that's
why there's these shows like these

01:05:05.269 --> 01:05:05.279
why there's these shows like these
 

01:05:05.279 --> 01:05:07.700
why there's these shows like these
Alaska shows where people living on the

01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:07.710
Alaska shows where people living on the
 

01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:10.160
Alaska shows where people living on the
frontier and they're fucking collecting

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:10.170
frontier and they're fucking collecting
 

01:05:10.170 --> 01:05:12.380
frontier and they're fucking collecting
wood and fighting off wolves it's like

wood and fighting off wolves it's like
we almost long for that simplicity above

01:05:15.589 --> 01:05:15.599
we almost long for that simplicity above
 

01:05:15.599 --> 01:05:18.589
we almost long for that simplicity above
this world that we've complicated to

01:05:18.589 --> 01:05:18.599
this world that we've complicated to
 

01:05:18.599 --> 01:05:21.559
this world that we've complicated to
this almost unmanageable point yeah it's

01:05:21.559 --> 01:05:21.569
this almost unmanageable point yeah it's
 

01:05:21.569 --> 01:05:23.989
this almost unmanageable point yeah it's
definitely true and you see in in so

01:05:23.989 --> 01:05:23.999
definitely true and you see in in so
 

01:05:23.999 --> 01:05:25.849

01:14:27.539 --> 01:14:28.790
interesting how how long it takes for
some of these problems to be worked out

01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:28.800
some of these problems to be worked out
 

01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:31.189

members were incarcerated and because

01:14:46.790 --> 01:14:46.800
members were incarcerated and because
 

01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:48.889
members were incarcerated and because
they were incarcerated they created a

01:14:48.889 --> 01:14:48.899
they were incarcerated they created a
 

01:14:48.899 --> 01:14:50.599
they were incarcerated they created a
vacuum that was there was a power

01:14:50.599 --> 01:14:50.609
vacuum that was there was a power
 

01:14:50.609 --> 01:14:52.639
vacuum that was there was a power
struggle to try to fill the vacuum that

01:14:52.639 --> 01:14:52.649
struggle to try to fill the vacuum that
 

01:14:52.649 --> 01:14:54.319
struggle to try to fill the vacuum that
power struggle started this sort of

01:14:54.319 --> 01:14:54.329
power struggle started this sort of
 

01:14:54.329 --> 01:14:56.719
power struggle started this sort of
violent war going on between all these

01:14:56.719 --> 01:14:56.729
violent war going on between all these
 

01:14:56.729 --> 01:14:59.149
violent war going on between all these
different criminal factions and then you

01:14:59.149 --> 01:14:59.159
different criminal factions and then you
 

01:14:59.159 --> 01:15:01.669
different criminal factions and then you
know it builds up and you know he was

01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:01.679
know it builds up and you know he was
 

01:15:01.679 --> 01:15:03.259
know it builds up and you know he was
really kind of interesting because he

01:15:03.259 --> 01:15:03.269
really kind of interesting because he
 

01:15:03.269 --> 01:15:04.339
really kind of interesting because he
was talking about it goes you know what

01:15:04.339 --> 01:15:04.349
was talking about it goes you know what
 

01:15:04.349 --> 01:15:06.949
was talking about it goes you know what
the best way to fix it he goes legalize

01:15:06.949 --> 01:15:06.959
the best way to fix it he goes legalize
 

01:15:06.959 --> 01:15:09.319
the best way to fix it he goes legalize
drugs he goes nobody wants to hear about

01:15:09.319 --> 01:15:09.329
drugs he goes nobody wants to hear about
 

01:15:09.329 --> 01:15:10.579
drugs he goes nobody wants to hear about
it but the reason why they're making all

01:15:10.579 --> 01:15:10.589
it but the reason why they're making all
 

01:15:10.589 --> 01:15:12.619
it but the reason why they're making all
this money is is because they're selling

01:15:12.619 --> 01:15:12.629
this money is is because they're selling
 

01:15:12.629 --> 01:15:13.729
this money is is because they're selling
something that's illegal

01:15:13.729 --> 01:15:13.739
something that's illegal
 

01:15:13.739 --> 01:15:15.589
something that's illegal
and so when sell you're selling

01:15:15.589 --> 01:15:15.599
and so when sell you're selling
 

01:15:15.599 --> 01:15:16.819
and so when sell you're selling
something that's illegal the only people

01:15:16.819 --> 01:15:16.829
something that's illegal the only people
 

01:15:16.829 --> 01:15:18.259
something that's illegal the only people
that are doing that are the people that

01:15:18.259 --> 01:15:18.269
that are doing that are the people that
 

01:15:18.269 --> 01:15:20.059
that are doing that are the people that
are criminals and he goes as soon as you

01:15:20.059 --> 01:15:20.069
are criminals and he goes as soon as you
 

01:15:20.069 --> 01:15:22.309
are criminals and he goes as soon as you
make it legal you deal with a personal

01:15:22.309 --> 01:15:22.319
make it legal you deal with a personal
 

01:15:22.319 --> 01:15:23.839
make it legal you deal with a personal
choice issue and the guy was like very

01:15:23.839 --> 01:15:23.849
choice issue and the guy was like very
 

01:15:23.849 --> 01:15:25.309
choice issue and the guy was like very
rational about it it was like you

01:15:25.309 --> 01:15:25.319
rational about it it was like you
 

01:15:25.319 --> 01:15:26.389
rational about it it was like you
dealing with the personal choice issue

01:15:26.389 --> 01:15:26.399
dealing with the personal choice issue
 

01:15:26.399 --> 01:15:28.040
dealing with the personal choice issue
instead of a crime issue but I think

01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:28.050
instead of a crime issue but I think
 

01:15:28.050 --> 01:15:29.599
instead of a crime issue but I think
that's exactly right I think is one of

01:15:29.599 --> 01:15:29.609
that's exactly right I think is one of
 

01:15:29.609 --> 01:15:32.750
that's exactly right I think is one of
the more kind of interesting ways into

01:15:32.750 --> 01:15:32.760
the more kind of interesting ways into
 

01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:34.070
the more kind of interesting ways into
that whole drug legalization

01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:34.080
that whole drug legalization
 

01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:35.780
that whole drug legalization
argument is is to think about the the

01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:35.790
argument is is to think about the the
 

01:15:35.790 --> 01:15:38.840
argument is is to think about the the
social problems that come from the

01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:38.850
social problems that come from the
 

01:15:38.850 --> 01:15:40.970
social problems that come from the
current rules not not just you know the

01:15:40.970 --> 01:15:40.980
current rules not not just you know the
 

01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:42.470
current rules not not just you know the
a lot of times people talk about the

01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:42.480
a lot of times people talk about the
 

01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:44.270
a lot of times people talk about the
drug use being a social problem but

01:15:44.270 --> 01:15:44.280
drug use being a social problem but
 

01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:45.620
drug use being a social problem but
actually it's everything that comes from

01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:45.630
actually it's everything that comes from
 

01:15:45.630 --> 01:15:47.980
actually it's everything that comes from
it the crime and the gangs and and

01:15:47.980 --> 01:15:47.990
it the crime and the gangs and and
 

01:15:47.990 --> 01:15:50.600
it the crime and the gangs and and
that's I think the you know the the most

01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:50.610
that's I think the you know the the most
 

01:15:50.610 --> 01:15:52.880
that's I think the you know the the most
intelligent argument for legalization

01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:52.890
intelligent argument for legalization
 

01:15:52.890 --> 01:15:55.010
intelligent argument for legalization
yeah and there was a real interesting

01:15:55.010 --> 01:15:55.020
yeah and there was a real interesting
 

01:15:55.020 --> 01:15:56.930
yeah and there was a real interesting
article recently about Mexico where they

01:15:56.930 --> 01:15:56.940
article recently about Mexico where they
 

01:15:56.940 --> 01:15:58.840
article recently about Mexico where they
were talking about the cartels like

01:15:58.840 --> 01:15:58.850
were talking about the cartels like
 

01:15:58.850 --> 01:16:01.970
were talking about the cartels like
hemorrhaging money because they relied

01:16:01.970 --> 01:16:01.980
hemorrhaging money because they relied
 

01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:04.340
hemorrhaging money because they relied
on marijuana trade and now with legal

01:16:04.340 --> 01:16:04.350
on marijuana trade and now with legal
 

01:16:04.350 --> 01:16:06.260
on marijuana trade and now with legal
marijuana just legal marijuana in

01:16:06.260 --> 01:16:06.270
marijuana just legal marijuana in
 

01:16:06.270 --> 01:16:09.230
marijuana just legal marijuana in
Colorado and in Washington State and

01:16:09.230 --> 01:16:09.240
Colorado and in Washington State and
 

01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:11.290
Colorado and in Washington State and
then all the medical places have

01:16:11.290 --> 01:16:11.300
then all the medical places have
 

01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:14.420
then all the medical places have
massively diminished the amount of

01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:14.430
massively diminished the amount of
 

01:16:14.430 --> 01:16:16.610
massively diminished the amount of
influence that these guys have of the

01:16:16.610 --> 01:16:16.620
influence that these guys have of the
 

01:16:16.620 --> 01:16:19.160
influence that these guys have of the
amount of wealth that they can get from

01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:19.170
amount of wealth that they can get from
 

01:16:19.170 --> 01:16:21.230
amount of wealth that they can get from
selling illegal drugs because people

01:16:21.230 --> 01:16:21.240
selling illegal drugs because people
 

01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:22.850
selling illegal drugs because people
don't need it anymore it's super easy to

01:16:22.850 --> 01:16:22.860
don't need it anymore it's super easy to
 

01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:24.950
don't need it anymore it's super easy to
get so like the marijuana trade which is

01:16:24.950 --> 01:16:24.960
get so like the marijuana trade which is
 

01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:26.900
get so like the marijuana trade which is
one of the most common drugs it's kind

01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:26.910
one of the most common drugs it's kind
 

01:16:26.910 --> 01:16:28.610
one of the most common drugs it's kind
of drying up for them and so they're

01:16:28.610 --> 01:16:28.620
of drying up for them and so they're
 

01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:30.260
of drying up for them and so they're
scrambling to try to find some other

01:16:30.260 --> 01:16:30.270
scrambling to try to find some other
 

01:16:30.270 --> 01:16:32.060
scrambling to try to find some other
avenues of revenue it's pretty

01:16:32.060 --> 01:16:32.070
avenues of revenue it's pretty
 

01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:34.730
avenues of revenue it's pretty
interesting stuff because it just shows

01:16:34.730 --> 01:16:34.740
interesting stuff because it just shows
 

01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:37.490
interesting stuff because it just shows
people this is this is what you do when

01:16:37.490 --> 01:16:37.500
people this is this is what you do when
 

01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:39.170
people this is this is what you do when
you make things illegal and it's we

01:16:39.170 --> 01:16:39.180
you make things illegal and it's we
 

01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:41.090
you make things illegal and it's we
should have figured it out in the 1920s

01:16:41.090 --> 01:16:41.100
should have figured it out in the 1920s
 

01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:42.800
should have figured it out in the 1920s
with Prohibition I mean it's amazing

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:42.810
with Prohibition I mean it's amazing
 

01:16:42.810 --> 01:16:45.170
with Prohibition I mean it's amazing
that people are so goofy today that they

01:16:45.170 --> 01:16:45.180
that people are so goofy today that they
 

01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:47.630
that people are so goofy today that they
still are dealing with the same issue

01:16:47.630 --> 01:16:47.640
still are dealing with the same issue
 

01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:50.210
still are dealing with the same issue
that they kind of resolved in the 1920s

01:16:50.210 --> 01:16:50.220
that they kind of resolved in the 1920s
 

01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:52.220
that they kind of resolved in the 1920s
yeah almost a hundred years ago they

01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:52.230
yeah almost a hundred years ago they
 

01:16:52.230 --> 01:16:53.780
yeah almost a hundred years ago they
figure this out with alcohol and they

01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:53.790
figure this out with alcohol and they
 

01:16:53.790 --> 01:16:56.480
figure this out with alcohol and they
have to relearn the same lesson with

01:16:56.480 --> 01:16:56.490
have to relearn the same lesson with
 

01:16:56.490 --> 01:16:59.930
have to relearn the same lesson with
with cannabis it's just it's nutty and

01:16:59.930 --> 01:16:59.940
with cannabis it's just it's nutty and
 

01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:01.700

01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:13.940
and it's interesting I think that the
the politicians have been put off for a

01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:13.950
the politicians have been put off for a
 

01:17:13.950 --> 01:17:15.590

that's changing and it's changing really

01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:23.430
that's changing and it's changing really
 

01:17:23.430 --> 01:17:24.620

encapsulates a an entire group of people

01:23:42.410 --> 01:23:42.420
encapsulates a an entire group of people
 

01:23:42.420 --> 01:23:44.260
encapsulates a an entire group of people
that share these ideas and they can

01:23:44.260 --> 01:23:44.270
that share these ideas and they can
 

01:23:44.270 --> 01:23:47.000
that share these ideas and they can
freely communicate and I think they're

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:47.010
freely communicate and I think they're
 

01:23:47.010 --> 01:23:49.280
freely communicate and I think they're
just starting to realize that they can

01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:49.290
just starting to realize that they can
 

01:23:49.290 --> 01:23:51.280
just starting to realize that they can
freely communicate the way they can and

01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:51.290
freely communicate the way they can and
 

01:23:51.290 --> 01:23:53.350
freely communicate the way they can and
unfortunately a lot of them are annoying

01:23:53.350 --> 01:23:53.360
unfortunately a lot of them are annoying
 

01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:55.040
unfortunately a lot of them are annoying
unfortunately a lot of people that have

unfortunately a lot of people that have
 

01:23:55.050 --> 01:23:57.170
unfortunately a lot of people that have
figured this out or annoying and you see

01:23:57.170 --> 01:23:57.180
figured this out or annoying and you see
 

01:23:57.180 --> 01:23:59.060
figured this out or annoying and you see
these really dumb ideas that spread like

01:23:59.060 --> 01:23:59.070
these really dumb ideas that spread like
 

01:23:59.070 --> 01:24:01.850
these really dumb ideas that spread like
wildfire wildfire and a bunch of idiots

01:24:01.850 --> 01:24:01.860
wildfire wildfire and a bunch of idiots
 

01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:03.740
wildfire wildfire and a bunch of idiots
are behind in its that's fascinating to

01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:03.750
are behind in its that's fascinating to
 

01:24:03.750 --> 01:24:07.100
are behind in its that's fascinating to
watch too but I think ultimately when it

01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:07.110
watch too but I think ultimately when it
 

01:24:07.110 --> 01:24:09.560
watch too but I think ultimately when it
all balances itself out we're gonna deal

01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:09.570
all balances itself out we're gonna deal
 

01:24:09.570 --> 01:24:12.050
all balances itself out we're gonna deal
with a much more informed much more

01:24:12.050 --> 01:24:12.060
with a much more informed much more
 

01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:14.060
with a much more informed much more
educated much more aware much more

01:24:14.060 --> 01:24:14.070
educated much more aware much more
 

01:24:14.070 --> 01:24:16.310

socially conscious society than we have

01:24:16.310 --> 01:24:16.320
socially conscious society than we have
 

01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:18.470
socially conscious society than we have
ever had in the past I think a decade

01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:18.480
ever had in the past I think a decade
 

01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:20.150
ever had in the past I think a decade
from now to Dec two decades from now

01:24:20.150 --> 01:24:20.160
from now to Dec two decades from now
 

01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:22.370
from now to Dec two decades from now
we're gonna see the rewards of this and

01:24:22.370 --> 01:24:22.380
we're gonna see the rewards of this and
 

01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:25.790
we're gonna see the rewards of this and
I'm very optimistic that that way of

01:24:25.790 --> 01:24:25.800
I'm very optimistic that that way of
 

01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:27.710
I'm very optimistic that that way of
thinking about and I agree and I guess

01:24:27.710 --> 01:24:27.720
thinking about and I agree and I guess
 

01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:28.520
thinking about and I agree and I guess
what we're

01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:28.530
what we're
 

01:24:28.530 --> 01:24:31.130
what we're
the way we're thinking about it is that

01:24:31.130 --> 01:24:31.140
the way we're thinking about it is that
 

01:24:31.140 --> 01:24:34.610
the way we're thinking about it is that
that we want to kind of now the next

01:24:34.610 --> 01:24:34.620
that we want to kind of now the next
 

01:24:34.620 --> 01:24:37.700
that we want to kind of now the next
step really is to really take that

01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:37.710
step really is to really take that
 

01:24:37.710 --> 01:24:41.360
step really is to really take that
energy and and really direct it into the

01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:41.370
energy and and really direct it into the
 

01:24:41.370 --> 01:24:43.460
energy and and really direct it into the
heart of the political system mmm not

01:24:43.460 --> 01:24:43.470
heart of the political system mmm not
 

01:24:43.470 --> 01:24:45.260
heart of the political system mmm not
kind of on the edges of it with kind of

01:24:45.260 --> 01:24:45.270
kind of on the edges of it with kind of
 

01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:48.410
kind of on the edges of it with kind of
protests and and and sort of social

01:24:48.410 --> 01:24:48.420
protests and and and sort of social
 

01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:50.120
protests and and and sort of social
movements but really getting into the

01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:50.130
movements but really getting into the
 

01:24:50.130 --> 01:24:53.570
movements but really getting into the
guts of the of the way laws are made and

01:24:53.570 --> 01:24:53.580
guts of the of the way laws are made and
 

01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:56.240
guts of the of the way laws are made and
bright and the way the country is run

01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:56.250
bright and the way the country is run
 

01:24:56.250 --> 01:24:58.310
bright and the way the country is run
the states around cities are on and and

01:24:58.310 --> 01:24:58.320
the states around cities are on and and
 

01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:00.800
the states around cities are on and and
and kind of injecting it into the into

and kind of injecting it into the into
 

01:25:00.810 --> 01:25:03.560
and kind of injecting it into the into
the real heart of power I think that's

01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:03.570
the real heart of power I think that's
 

01:25:03.570 --> 01:25:04.640
the real heart of power I think that's
got to be the next step

01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:04.650
got to be the next step
 

01:25:04.650 --> 01:25:08.000
got to be the next step
yes I I agree and I hope that it can be

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:08.010
yes I I agree and I hope that it can be
 

01:25:08.010 --> 01:25:10.370
yes I I agree and I hope that it can be
done I mean I wonder if the way

01:25:10.370 --> 01:25:10.380
done I mean I wonder if the way
 

01:25:10.380 --> 01:25:12.520
done I mean I wonder if the way
technology is advancing and the way

01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:12.530
technology is advancing and the way
 

01:25:12.530 --> 01:25:14.750
technology is advancing and the way
technological innovation seems to

01:25:14.750 --> 01:25:14.760
technological innovation seems to
 

01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:17.690
technological innovation seems to
exponentially increase if there's some

01:25:17.690 --> 01:25:17.700
exponentially increase if there's some
 

01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:20.470
exponentially increase if there's some
way to manage things in a way that's

01:25:20.470 --> 01:25:20.480
way to manage things in a way that's
 

01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:24.920
way to manage things in a way that's
sort of not discovered yet or sort of

01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:24.930
sort of not discovered yet or sort of
 

01:25:24.930 --> 01:25:27.860
sort of not discovered yet or sort of
hasn't been no one's figured out a way

01:25:27.860 --> 01:25:27.870
hasn't been no one's figured out a way
 

01:25:27.870 --> 01:25:30.500
hasn't been no one's figured out a way
to sort of organize this whole thing in

01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:30.510
to sort of organize this whole thing in
 

01:25:30.510 --> 01:25:33.290
to sort of organize this whole thing in
a way that's much clearer and now we're

01:25:33.290 --> 01:25:33.300
a way that's much clearer and now we're
 

01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:35.570
a way that's much clearer and now we're
dealing it's almost like code like do

01:25:35.570 --> 01:25:35.580
dealing it's almost like code like do
 

01:25:35.580 --> 01:25:37.070
dealing it's almost like code like do
you remember what code used to look like

01:25:37.070 --> 01:25:37.080
you remember what code used to look like
 

01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:39.950
you remember what code used to look like
when used to use DOS and if you use an

01:25:39.950 --> 01:25:39.960
when used to use DOS and if you use an
 

01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:41.780
when used to use DOS and if you use an
old computer you emptor everything in

01:25:41.780 --> 01:25:41.790
old computer you emptor everything in
 

01:25:41.790 --> 01:25:44.330
old computer you emptor everything in
command prompts yeah but then someone

01:25:44.330 --> 01:25:44.340
command prompts yeah but then someone
 

01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:46.070
command prompts yeah but then someone
came along like Xerox figured out this

01:25:46.070 --> 01:25:46.080
came along like Xerox figured out this
 

01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:47.630
came along like Xerox figured out this
graphic user interface you just well

01:25:47.630 --> 01:25:47.640
graphic user interface you just well
 

01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:49.670
graphic user interface you just well
fuck all that just see that thing just

01:25:49.670 --> 01:25:49.680
fuck all that just see that thing just
 

01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:51.680
fuck all that just see that thing just
double just press twice when you want

01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:51.690
double just press twice when you want
 

01:25:51.690 --> 01:25:53.780
double just press twice when you want
that to open up and boom and then you

01:25:53.780 --> 01:25:53.790
that to open up and boom and then you
 

01:25:53.790 --> 01:25:55.970
that to open up and boom and then you
see a graphic representation of what you

01:25:55.970 --> 01:25:55.980
see a graphic representation of what you
 

01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:58.430
see a graphic representation of what you
want it's a much more simplistic element

01:25:58.430 --> 01:25:58.440
want it's a much more simplistic element
 

01:25:58.440 --> 01:25:59.750
want it's a much more simplistic element
you don't have to look at all the code

01:25:59.750 --> 01:25:59.760
you don't have to look at all the code
 

01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:01.820
you don't have to look at all the code
behind what you're doing when you're

01:26:01.820 --> 01:26:01.830
behind what you're doing when you're
 

01:26:01.830 --> 01:26:04.910
behind what you're doing when you're
using Microsoft Word cut all that shit

01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:04.920
using Microsoft Word cut all that shit
 

01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:07.310
using Microsoft Word cut all that shit
out let's just see let's let's make it

01:26:07.310 --> 01:26:07.320
out let's just see let's let's make it
 

01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:10.010
out let's just see let's let's make it
real simple and if we could get get it

01:26:10.010 --> 01:26:10.020
real simple and if we could get get it
 

01:26:10.020 --> 01:26:13.640
real simple and if we could get get it
to that in politics like okay what would

01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:13.650
to that in politics like okay what would
 

01:26:13.650 --> 01:26:16.610
to that in politics like okay what would
make what would what would we have to do

01:26:16.610 --> 01:26:16.620
make what would what would we have to do
 

01:26:16.620 --> 01:26:20.090
make what would what would we have to do
to make more money go towards school and

01:26:20.090 --> 01:26:20.100
to make more money go towards school and
 

01:26:20.100 --> 01:26:23.660
to make more money go towards school and
less money go towards war like is that

01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:23.670
less money go towards war like is that
 

01:26:23.670 --> 01:26:25.340
less money go towards war like is that
it's not a way is there a way we could

01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:25.350
it's not a way is there a way we could
 

01:26:25.350 --> 01:26:27.050
it's not a way is there a way we could
work that out if you look at how much

01:26:27.050 --> 01:26:27.060
work that out if you look at how much
 

01:26:27.060 --> 01:26:29.420
work that out if you look at how much
money is being spent in the Iraq war how

01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:29.430
money is being spent in the Iraq war how
 

01:26:29.430 --> 01:26:31.940
money is being spent in the Iraq war how
much money is being spent in Afghanistan

01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:31.950
much money is being spent in Afghanistan
 

01:26:31.950 --> 01:26:35.510
much money is being spent in Afghanistan
is there a way to take 30% of that and

01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:35.520
is there a way to take 30% of that and
 

01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:37.940
is there a way to take 30% of that and
put it into our schools because oh my

01:26:37.940 --> 01:26:37.950
put it into our schools because oh my
 

01:26:37.950 --> 01:26:39.410
put it into our schools because oh my
god the school system would radically

01:26:39.410 --> 01:26:39.420
god the school system would radically
 

01:26:39.420 --> 01:26:41.570
god the school system would radically
change our education system would

01:26:41.570 --> 01:26:41.580
change our education system would
 

01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:42.020
change our education system would
radically

01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:42.030
radically
 

01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:44.780
radically
the amount of people that would come out

01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:44.790
the amount of people that would come out
 

01:26:44.790 --> 01:26:47.600
the amount of people that would come out
of these educational systems that were

01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:47.610
of these educational systems that were
 

01:26:47.610 --> 01:26:51.140
of these educational systems that were
more balanced more aware had more

01:26:51.140 --> 01:26:51.150
more balanced more aware had more
 

01:26:51.150 --> 01:26:53.570
more balanced more aware had more
nuanced perspectives would radically

01:26:53.570 --> 01:26:53.580
nuanced perspectives would radically
 

01:26:53.580 --> 01:26:56.210
nuanced perspectives would radically
change our country would radically

01:26:56.210 --> 01:26:56.220
change our country would radically
 

01:26:56.220 --> 01:26:58.310
change our country would radically
improve like over the course of a decade

01:26:58.310 --> 01:26:58.320
improve like over the course of a decade
 

01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:01.400
improve like over the course of a decade
if you could just figure out a way to

01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:01.410
if you could just figure out a way to
 

01:27:01.410 --> 01:27:03.890
if you could just figure out a way to
put that kind of power in people's hands

01:27:03.890 --> 01:27:03.900
put that kind of power in people's hands
 

01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:06.170
put that kind of power in people's hands
what they choose to do well I think the

01:27:06.170 --> 01:27:06.180
what they choose to do well I think the
 

01:27:06.180 --> 01:27:08.300
what they choose to do well I think the
way that you do that is it goes back to

01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:08.310
way that you do that is it goes back to
 

01:27:08.310 --> 01:27:11.570
way that you do that is it goes back to
what we're saying earlier is is actually

01:27:11.570 --> 01:27:11.580
what we're saying earlier is is actually
 

01:27:11.580 --> 01:27:14.930
what we're saying earlier is is actually
literally doing it by by getting rid of

01:27:14.930 --> 01:27:14.940
literally doing it by by getting rid of
 

01:27:14.940 --> 01:27:17.690
literally doing it by by getting rid of
these kind of big organizations central

01:27:17.690 --> 01:27:17.700
these kind of big organizations central
 

01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:19.970
these kind of big organizations central
government organizations that try and

01:27:19.970 --> 01:27:19.980
government organizations that try and
 

01:27:19.980 --> 01:27:23.660
government organizations that try and
run the whole system from some office

01:27:23.660 --> 01:27:23.670
run the whole system from some office
 

01:27:23.670 --> 01:27:25.430
run the whole system from some office
somewhere that's completely removed from

01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:25.440
somewhere that's completely removed from
 

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:26.720
somewhere that's completely removed from
the from their parents and the kids

01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:26.730
the from their parents and the kids
 

01:27:26.730 --> 01:27:28.040
the from their parents and the kids
that's actually using the schools and

01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:28.050
that's actually using the schools and
 

01:27:28.050 --> 01:27:31.730
that's actually using the schools and
and really give responsibility for this

01:27:31.730 --> 01:27:31.740
and really give responsibility for this
 

01:27:31.740 --> 01:27:33.920
and really give responsibility for this
through the way the schools operate to

01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:33.930
through the way the schools operate to
 

01:27:33.930 --> 01:27:36.380
through the way the schools operate to
local communities so that they can try

01:27:36.380 --> 01:27:36.390
local communities so that they can try
 

01:27:36.390 --> 01:27:38.120
local communities so that they can try
things out because every kid is

01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:38.130
things out because every kid is
 

01:27:38.130 --> 01:27:39.200
things out because every kid is
different they learn in different ways

01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:39.210
different they learn in different ways
 

01:27:39.210 --> 01:27:40.940
different they learn in different ways
whatever nature feels to me like when it

01:27:40.940 --> 01:27:40.950
whatever nature feels to me like when it
 

01:27:40.950 --> 01:27:42.500
whatever nature feels to me like when it
comes to education we got this approach

01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:42.510
comes to education we got this approach
 

01:27:42.510 --> 01:27:44.990
comes to education we got this approach
which is someone has decided you know

01:27:44.990 --> 01:27:45.000
which is someone has decided you know
 

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.460
which is someone has decided you know
this is the theory this is how we're

01:27:46.460 --> 01:27:46.470
this is the theory this is how we're
 

01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:48.800
this is the theory this is how we're
gonna get kids to learn whatever it may

01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:48.810
gonna get kids to learn whatever it may
 

01:27:48.810 --> 01:27:49.010
gonna get kids to learn whatever it may
be

01:27:49.010 --> 01:27:49.020
be
 

01:27:49.020 --> 01:27:51.140
be
and we're gonna try and have a kind of

01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:51.150
and we're gonna try and have a kind of
 

01:27:51.150 --> 01:27:53.330
and we're gonna try and have a kind of
common application of that in every

01:27:53.330 --> 01:27:53.340
common application of that in every
 

01:27:53.340 --> 01:27:55.460
common application of that in every
school and everyone's going to teach the

01:27:55.460 --> 01:27:55.470
school and everyone's going to teach the
 

01:27:55.470 --> 01:27:57.920
school and everyone's going to teach the
same way and that's great and I just

01:27:57.920 --> 01:27:57.930
same way and that's great and I just
 

01:27:57.930 --> 01:27:59.300
same way and that's great and I just
think that the evidence shows that is

01:27:59.300 --> 01:27:59.310
think that the evidence shows that is
 

01:27:59.310 --> 01:28:01.460
think that the evidence shows that is
not right it doesn't work for every kid

01:28:01.460 --> 01:28:01.470
not right it doesn't work for every kid
 

01:28:01.470 --> 01:28:04.390
not right it doesn't work for every kid
and you want to have a system where you

01:28:04.390 --> 01:28:04.400
and you want to have a system where you
 

01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:07.750
and you want to have a system where you
know you've got much more ability to

01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:07.760
know you've got much more ability to
 

01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:09.950
know you've got much more ability to
experiment and try things out and adapt

01:28:09.950 --> 01:28:09.960
experiment and try things out and adapt
 

01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:13.490
experiment and try things out and adapt
things to each each you know different

01:28:13.490 --> 01:28:13.500
things to each each you know different
 

01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:15.290
things to each each you know different
type of child and that way that they

01:28:15.290 --> 01:28:15.300
type of child and that way that they
 

01:28:15.300 --> 01:28:17.330
type of child and that way that they
learn and and I think we need to see a

01:28:17.330 --> 01:28:17.340
learn and and I think we need to see a
 

01:28:17.340 --> 01:28:19.550
learn and and I think we need to see a
lot more kind of smaller schools where

01:28:19.550 --> 01:28:19.560
lot more kind of smaller schools where
 

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:21.440
lot more kind of smaller schools where
they're much more kind of community run

01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:21.450
they're much more kind of community run
 

01:28:21.450 --> 01:28:22.640
they're much more kind of community run
a pill are you saying with the gardening

01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:22.650
a pill are you saying with the gardening
 

01:28:22.650 --> 01:28:24.530
a pill are you saying with the gardening
I think it's sort of a community

01:28:24.530 --> 01:28:24.540
I think it's sort of a community
 

01:28:24.540 --> 01:28:26.840
I think it's sort of a community
approach to these things is gonna be the

01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:26.850
approach to these things is gonna be the
 

01:28:26.850 --> 01:28:27.950
approach to these things is gonna be the
way to do it you definitely need the

01:28:27.950 --> 01:28:27.960
way to do it you definitely need the
 

01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:29.690
way to do it you definitely need the
money of course to sort of have high

01:28:29.690 --> 01:28:29.700
money of course to sort of have high
 

01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:31.550
money of course to sort of have high
quality as well so I agree with that

01:28:31.550 --> 01:28:31.560
quality as well so I agree with that
 

01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:33.740
quality as well so I agree with that
it's just that if you just put more

01:28:33.740 --> 01:28:33.750
it's just that if you just put more
 

01:28:33.750 --> 01:28:35.960
it's just that if you just put more
money into the current system of

01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:35.970
money into the current system of
 

01:28:35.970 --> 01:28:38.030
money into the current system of
organizing schools I don't think you'll

01:28:38.030 --> 01:28:38.040
organizing schools I don't think you'll
 

01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:40.460
organizing schools I don't think you'll
get the kind of benefit that you could

01:28:40.460 --> 01:28:40.470
get the kind of benefit that you could
 

01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:42.710
get the kind of benefit that you could
if you actually gave the power over the

01:28:42.710 --> 01:28:42.720
if you actually gave the power over the
 

01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:44.720
if you actually gave the power over the
system and took it away from the people

01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:44.730
system and took it away from the people
 

01:28:44.730 --> 01:28:45.980
system and took it away from the people
at the center and put it in the hands of

01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:45.990
at the center and put it in the hands of
 

01:28:45.990 --> 01:28:47.480
at the center and put it in the hands of
people locally that that's how I would

01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:47.490
people locally that that's how I would
 

01:28:47.490 --> 01:28:49.610
people locally that that's how I would
do and if they did that you could also

01:28:49.610 --> 01:28:49.620
do and if they did that you could also
 

01:28:49.620 --> 01:28:52.070
do and if they did that you could also
see the results positive and negative

01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080
see the results positive and negative
 

01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:54.770
see the results positive and negative
and imitate the positive ones so you

01:28:54.770 --> 01:28:54.780
and imitate the positive ones so you
 

01:28:54.780 --> 01:28:55.700
and imitate the positive ones so you
could see like

01:28:55.700 --> 01:28:55.710
could see like
 

01:28:55.710 --> 01:28:57.020
could see like
these people have an approach and their

01:28:57.020 --> 01:28:57.030
these people have an approach and their
 

01:28:57.030 --> 01:28:58.970
these people have an approach and their
approach is more sort of Waldorf School

01:28:58.970 --> 01:28:58.980
approach is more sort of Waldorf School
 

01:28:58.980 --> 01:29:01.130
approach is more sort of Waldorf School

01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:08.910
creative but then there's another place
 

01:29:08.910 --> 01:29:10.490
creative but then there's another place
in San Francisco that's much more tech

01:29:10.490 --> 01:29:10.500
in San Francisco that's much more tech
 

01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:12.740
in San Francisco that's much more tech

important job that get paid twenty

01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:41.520
important job that get paid twenty
 

01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:42.770
important job that get paid twenty
thousand dollars a year right and

01:29:42.770 --> 01:29:42.780
thousand dollars a year right and
 

01:29:42.780 --> 01:29:44.270
thousand dollars a year right and
there's not going to get that if you're

01:29:44.270 --> 01:29:44.280
there's not going to get that if you're
 

01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:46.160
there's not going to get that if you're
painting those kind of you know it's

01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:46.170
painting those kind of you know it's
 

01:29:46.170 --> 01:29:48.200
painting those kind of you know it's
really kind of obvious we apply that in

01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:48.210
really kind of obvious we apply that in
 

01:29:48.210 --> 01:29:51.110

spent quite a lot of time this when I
 

01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:08.600
spent quite a lot of time this when I
was in the government Finland is a place

01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:08.610
was in the government Finland is a place
 

01:30:08.610 --> 01:30:10.610
was in the government Finland is a place
where it is the cultural thing if you if

01:30:10.610 --> 01:30:10.620
where it is the cultural thing if you if

a teacher it's like one of the best
 

01:30:18.570 --> 01:30:20.360
a teacher it's like one of the best
things you can do and that's true I

01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:20.370
things you can do and that's true I

think of a lot of the Scandinavian
 

01:30:21.719 --> 01:30:22.880
think of a lot of the Scandinavian
countries and they have better results

01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:22.890
countries and they have better results

vegetables and doing so in this fear
that society was going to collapse and

02:16:52.570 --> 02:16:52.580
that society was going to collapse and
 

02:16:52.580 --> 02:16:56.089
that society was going to collapse and
my friend Jimmy was like if society

02:16:56.089 --> 02:16:56.099
my friend Jimmy was like if society
 

02:16:56.099 --> 02:16:57.740
my friend Jimmy was like if society
collapses you don't want to live man

02:16:57.740 --> 02:16:57.750
collapses you don't want to live man
 

02:16:57.750 --> 02:16:59.480
collapses you don't want to live man
like you don't want to be that one

02:16:59.480 --> 02:16:59.490
like you don't want to be that one
 

02:16:59.490 --> 02:17:01.190
like you don't want to be that one
fucking guy that's got all the food and

02:17:01.190 --> 02:17:01.200
fucking guy that's got all the food and
 

02:17:01.200 --> 02:17:02.870
fucking guy that's got all the food and
you're you know standing on your porch

02:17:02.870 --> 02:17:02.880
you're you know standing on your porch
 

02:17:02.880 --> 02:17:04.669
you're you know standing on your porch
or the rifle and you're all taking turns

02:17:04.669 --> 02:17:04.679
or the rifle and you're all taking turns
 

02:17:04.679 --> 02:17:06.230
or the rifle and you're all taking turns
waiting for the zombies to come over the

02:17:06.230 --> 02:17:06.240
waiting for the zombies to come over the
 

02:17:06.240 --> 02:17:06.589
waiting for the zombies to come over the
hill

02:17:06.589 --> 02:17:06.599
hill
 

02:17:06.599 --> 02:17:09.349
hill
you know sounding the horns and alerting

02:17:09.349 --> 02:17:09.359
you know sounding the horns and alerting
 

02:17:09.359 --> 02:17:10.790
you know sounding the horns and alerting
the people that the barbarians have

02:17:10.790 --> 02:17:10.800
the people that the barbarians have
 

02:17:10.800 --> 02:17:12.650
the people that the barbarians have
arrived you don't want to do that and

02:17:12.650 --> 02:17:12.660
arrived you don't want to do that and
 

02:17:12.660 --> 02:17:13.700
arrived you don't want to do that and
you don't want to go back to those days

02:17:13.700 --> 02:17:13.710
you don't want to go back to those days
 

02:17:13.710 --> 02:17:17.719
you don't want to go back to those days
you just don't and I think that we we

02:17:17.719 --> 02:17:17.729
you just don't and I think that we we
 

02:17:17.729 --> 02:17:19.339
you just don't and I think that we we
don't want to go back to the days of no

02:17:19.339 --> 02:17:19.349
don't want to go back to the days of no
 

02:17:19.349 --> 02:17:21.290
don't want to go back to the days of no
language and we're not gonna want to go

02:17:21.290 --> 02:17:21.300
language and we're not gonna want to go
 

02:17:21.300 --> 02:17:23.599
language and we're not gonna want to go
back to the days of Secrets we're not

02:17:23.599 --> 02:17:23.609
back to the days of Secrets we're not
 

02:17:23.609 --> 02:17:25.759
back to the days of Secrets we're not
gonna want to once once the no secret

02:17:25.759 --> 02:17:25.769
gonna want to once once the no secret
 

02:17:25.769 --> 02:17:27.950
gonna want to once once the no secret
thing happens and people just get this

02:17:27.950 --> 02:17:27.960
thing happens and people just get this
 

02:17:27.960 --> 02:17:29.599
thing happens and people just get this
kind of understanding of what it is to

02:17:29.599 --> 02:17:29.609
kind of understanding of what it is to
 

02:17:29.609 --> 02:17:32.230
kind of understanding of what it is to
be a human being you know it's universal

02:17:32.230 --> 02:17:32.240
be a human being you know it's universal
 

02:17:32.240 --> 02:17:34.580
be a human being you know it's universal
yeah it reminds me that there's this

02:17:34.580 --> 02:17:34.590
yeah it reminds me that there's this
 

02:17:34.590 --> 02:17:36.919
yeah it reminds me that there's this
some work going on at Stanford they have

02:17:36.919 --> 02:17:36.929
some work going on at Stanford they have
 

02:17:36.929 --> 02:17:38.959
some work going on at Stanford they have
a virtual reality lab and they're

02:17:38.959 --> 02:17:38.969
a virtual reality lab and they're
 

02:17:38.969 --> 02:17:42.469
a virtual reality lab and they're
looking at how virtual reality could

02:17:42.469 --> 02:17:42.479
looking at how virtual reality could
 

02:17:42.479 --> 02:17:44.839
looking at how virtual reality could
change the way people think about other

02:17:44.839 --> 02:17:44.849
change the way people think about other
 

02:17:44.849 --> 02:17:46.549
change the way people think about other
people about their issues you know

02:17:46.549 --> 02:17:46.559
people about their issues you know
 

02:17:46.559 --> 02:17:47.780
people about their issues you know
there's there's one experiment they're

02:17:47.780 --> 02:17:47.790
there's there's one experiment they're
 

02:17:47.790 --> 02:17:48.950
there's there's one experiment they're
doing where

02:17:48.950 --> 02:17:48.960
doing where
 

02:17:48.960 --> 02:17:50.750
doing where
probably I'm trying to get it right

02:17:50.750 --> 02:17:50.760
probably I'm trying to get it right
 

02:17:50.760 --> 02:17:53.299
probably I'm trying to get it right
where they I think they put you as like

02:17:53.299 --> 02:17:53.309
where they I think they put you as like
 

02:17:53.309 --> 02:17:54.830
where they I think they put you as like
in a forest situation you think you're

02:17:54.830 --> 02:17:54.840
in a forest situation you think you're
 

02:17:54.840 --> 02:17:56.360
in a forest situation you think you're
in a forest and they and then they

02:17:56.360 --> 02:17:56.370
in a forest and they and then they
 

02:17:56.370 --> 02:17:59.150
in a forest and they and then they
measure or some nature some example of

02:17:59.150 --> 02:17:59.160
measure or some nature some example of
 

02:17:59.160 --> 02:18:01.729
measure or some nature some example of
nature and then they see how you know

02:18:01.729 --> 02:18:01.739
nature and then they see how you know
 

02:18:01.739 --> 02:18:03.080
nature and then they see how you know
they really give you a deep experience

02:18:03.080 --> 02:18:03.090
they really give you a deep experience
 

02:18:03.090 --> 02:18:05.450
they really give you a deep experience
of that through virtual reality and then

02:18:05.450 --> 02:18:05.460
of that through virtual reality and then
 

02:18:05.460 --> 02:18:07.370
of that through virtual reality and then
they look at your behavior in the next

02:18:07.370 --> 02:18:07.380
they look at your behavior in the next
 

02:18:07.380 --> 02:18:09.559
they look at your behavior in the next
week after that to see if you're more

02:18:09.559 --> 02:18:09.569
week after that to see if you're more
 

02:18:09.569 --> 02:18:11.330
week after that to see if you're more
conscious of that you recycle more you

02:18:11.330 --> 02:18:11.340
conscious of that you recycle more you
 

02:18:11.340 --> 02:18:13.700
conscious of that you recycle more you
change your behavior because of this

02:18:13.700 --> 02:18:13.710
change your behavior because of this
 

02:18:13.710 --> 02:18:15.950
change your behavior because of this
this completely false experience you've

02:18:15.950 --> 02:18:15.960
this completely false experience you've
 

02:18:15.960 --> 02:18:17.570
this completely false experience you've
had to give you this virtual reality

02:18:17.570 --> 02:18:17.580
had to give you this virtual reality
 

02:18:17.580 --> 02:18:19.759
had to give you this virtual reality
experience and and that's what they were

02:18:19.759 --> 02:18:19.769
experience and and that's what they were
 

02:18:19.769 --> 02:18:21.169
experience and and that's what they were
searching in all sorts of other ways and

02:18:21.169 --> 02:18:21.179
searching in all sorts of other ways and
 

02:18:21.179 --> 02:18:23.000
searching in all sorts of other ways and
I think it's just showing that it does

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:23.010
I think it's just showing that it does
 

02:18:23.010 --> 02:18:25.549
I think it's just showing that it does
Wow and you can actually influence

02:18:25.549 --> 02:18:25.559
Wow and you can actually influence
 

02:18:25.559 --> 02:18:27.110
Wow and you can actually influence
someone's behavior by giving them this

02:18:27.110 --> 02:18:27.120
someone's behavior by giving them this
 

02:18:27.120 --> 02:18:29.030
someone's behavior by giving them this
sense of another world

02:18:29.030 --> 02:18:29.040
sense of another world
 

02:18:29.040 --> 02:18:31.189
sense of another world
yeah and that's again just in its

02:18:31.189 --> 02:18:31.199
yeah and that's again just in its
 

02:18:31.199 --> 02:18:32.870
yeah and that's again just in its
infancy you know the the virtual reality

02:18:32.870 --> 02:18:32.880
infancy you know the the virtual reality
 

02:18:32.880 --> 02:18:36.919
infancy you know the the virtual reality
stuff is just getting going and and I

02:18:36.919 --> 02:18:36.929
stuff is just getting going and and I
 

02:18:36.929 --> 02:18:37.969
stuff is just getting going and and I
just think it's interesting all these

02:18:37.969 --> 02:18:37.979
just think it's interesting all these
 

02:18:37.979 --> 02:18:39.620
just think it's interesting all these
things how they will affect so many

02:18:39.620 --> 02:18:39.630
things how they will affect so many
 

02:18:39.630 --> 02:18:41.419
things how they will affect so many
aspects of how we relate to each other

02:18:41.419 --> 02:18:41.429
aspects of how we relate to each other
 

02:18:41.429 --> 02:18:43.879
aspects of how we relate to each other
and think about these issues that the

02:18:43.879 --> 02:18:43.889
and think about these issues that the
 

02:18:43.889 --> 02:18:46.910
and think about these issues that the
moment had just so kind of superficially

02:18:46.910 --> 02:18:46.920
moment had just so kind of superficially
 

02:18:46.920 --> 02:18:48.709
moment had just so kind of superficially
dealt with it's gonna get really

02:18:48.709 --> 02:18:48.719
dealt with it's gonna get really
 

02:18:48.719 --> 02:18:50.929
dealt with it's gonna get really
squirrelly when that artificial reality

02:18:50.929 --> 02:18:50.939
squirrelly when that artificial reality
 

02:18:50.939 --> 02:18:53.000
squirrelly when that artificial reality
is indistinguishable from the reality

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:53.010
is indistinguishable from the reality
 

02:18:53.010 --> 02:18:54.110
is indistinguishable from the reality
that we're experiencing right now

02:18:54.110 --> 02:18:54.120
that we're experiencing right now
 

02:18:54.120 --> 02:18:56.330
that we're experiencing right now
because that's coming to you know that's

02:18:56.330 --> 02:18:56.340
because that's coming to you know that's
 

02:18:56.340 --> 02:18:59.299
because that's coming to you know that's
what the whole simulation theory is is

02:18:59.299 --> 02:18:59.309
what the whole simulation theory is is
 

02:18:59.309 --> 02:19:01.910
what the whole simulation theory is is
based upon you know this idea that one

02:19:01.910 --> 02:19:01.920
based upon you know this idea that one
 

02:19:01.920 --> 02:19:03.349
based upon you know this idea that one
day we're gonna get to a point where you

02:19:03.349 --> 02:19:03.359
day we're gonna get to a point where you
 

02:19:03.359 --> 02:19:06.889
day we're gonna get to a point where you
can't tell whether or not we live in a

02:19:06.889 --> 02:19:06.899
can't tell whether or not we live in a
 

02:19:06.899 --> 02:19:09.200
can't tell whether or not we live in a
computer or we live in the material

02:19:09.200 --> 02:19:09.210
computer or we live in the material
 

02:19:09.210 --> 02:19:12.530
computer or we live in the material
carbon-based flesh world and if that's

02:19:12.530 --> 02:19:12.540
carbon-based flesh world and if that's
 

02:19:12.540 --> 02:19:14.419
carbon-based flesh world and if that's
the case how do we know that we haven't

02:19:14.419 --> 02:19:14.429
the case how do we know that we haven't
 

02:19:14.429 --> 02:19:16.160
the case how do we know that we haven't
already gotten to that point how do we

02:19:16.160 --> 02:19:16.170
already gotten to that point how do we
 

02:19:16.170 --> 02:19:17.629
already gotten to that point how do we
know that we're not in a computer right

02:19:17.629 --> 02:19:17.639
know that we're not in a computer right
 

02:19:17.639 --> 02:19:19.849
know that we're not in a computer right
now and we're thinking that we're

02:19:19.849 --> 02:19:19.859
now and we're thinking that we're
 

02:19:19.859 --> 02:19:21.709
now and we're thinking that we're
experiencing this reality but it's not

02:19:21.709 --> 02:19:21.719
experiencing this reality but it's not
 

02:19:21.719 --> 02:19:23.629
experiencing this reality but it's not
it's not really happening it's we're

02:19:23.629 --> 02:19:23.639
it's not really happening it's we're
 

02:19:23.639 --> 02:19:26.000
it's not really happening it's we're
just a part of a program and that it's

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:26.010
just a part of a program and that it's
 

02:19:26.010 --> 02:19:29.269
just a part of a program and that it's
so good that you just you can't you

02:19:29.269 --> 02:19:29.279
so good that you just you can't you
 

02:19:29.279 --> 02:19:31.040
so good that you just you can't you
think you really are Steve Hilton you're

02:19:31.040 --> 02:19:31.050
think you really are Steve Hilton you're
 

02:19:31.050 --> 02:19:32.450
think you really are Steve Hilton you're
not Steve Hillman you see you know the

02:19:32.450 --> 02:19:32.460
not Steve Hillman you see you know the
 

02:19:32.460 --> 02:19:36.500
not Steve Hillman you see you know the
truth shall set out the thing is that

02:19:36.500 --> 02:19:36.510
truth shall set out the thing is that
 

02:19:36.510 --> 02:19:38.719
truth shall set out the thing is that
when you this kind of gets to a point

02:19:38.719 --> 02:19:38.729
when you this kind of gets to a point
 

02:19:38.729 --> 02:19:41.179
when you this kind of gets to a point
where I just kind of I can't handle it

02:19:41.179 --> 02:19:41.189
where I just kind of I can't handle it
 

02:19:41.189 --> 02:19:42.889
where I just kind of I can't handle it
anymore my brain cannot literally cope

02:19:42.889 --> 02:19:42.899
anymore my brain cannot literally cope
 

02:19:42.899 --> 02:19:44.809
anymore my brain cannot literally cope
with thinking about some of this stuff I

02:19:44.809 --> 02:19:44.819
with thinking about some of this stuff I
 

02:19:44.819 --> 02:19:46.160
with thinking about some of this stuff I
remember a friend of mine repeatedly

02:19:46.160 --> 02:19:46.170
remember a friend of mine repeatedly
 

02:19:46.170 --> 02:19:48.460
remember a friend of mine repeatedly
trying to explain to me like quantum

02:19:48.460 --> 02:19:48.470
trying to explain to me like quantum
 

02:19:48.470 --> 02:19:51.620
trying to explain to me like quantum
physics and quantum things and I just

02:19:51.620 --> 02:19:51.630
physics and quantum things and I just
 

02:19:51.630 --> 02:19:54.410
physics and quantum things and I just
literally can't understand it yeah the

02:19:54.410 --> 02:19:54.420
literally can't understand it yeah the
 

02:19:54.420 --> 02:19:56.990
literally can't understand it yeah the
quantum stuff is hard really hard I have

02:19:56.990 --> 02:19:57.000
quantum stuff is hard really hard I have
 

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.360
quantum stuff is hard really hard I have
a had this notion of you know alternate

02:19:59.360 --> 02:19:59.370
a had this notion of you know alternate
 

02:19:59.370 --> 02:20:00.559
a had this notion of you know alternate
realities and things going on at the

02:20:00.559 --> 02:20:00.569
realities and things going on at the
 

02:20:00.569 --> 02:20:01.400
realities and things going on at the
same time and if I

02:20:01.400 --> 02:20:01.410
same time and if I
 

02:20:01.410 --> 02:20:03.440
same time and if I
just can't get around it it's almost

02:20:03.440 --> 02:20:03.450
just can't get around it it's almost
 

02:20:03.450 --> 02:20:06.650
just can't get around it it's almost
impossible to do it's it's really like

02:20:06.650 --> 02:20:06.660
impossible to do it's it's really like
 

02:20:06.660 --> 02:20:08.960
impossible to do it's it's really like
when we start getting into quantum stuff

02:20:08.960 --> 02:20:08.970
when we start getting into quantum stuff
 

02:20:08.970 --> 02:20:10.580
when we start getting into quantum stuff
I don't anything they understand it I

02:20:10.580 --> 02:20:10.590
I don't anything they understand it I
 

02:20:10.590 --> 02:20:12.440
I don't anything they understand it I
mean they they understand it in terms of

02:20:12.440 --> 02:20:12.450
mean they they understand it in terms of
 

02:20:12.450 --> 02:20:14.690
mean they they understand it in terms of
these theoretical concepts but it's so

02:20:14.690 --> 02:20:14.700
these theoretical concepts but it's so
 

02:20:14.700 --> 02:20:16.761
these theoretical concepts but it's so
abstract in a lot of ways when you're

02:20:16.761 --> 02:20:16.771
abstract in a lot of ways when you're
 

02:20:16.771 --> 02:20:18.950
abstract in a lot of ways when you're
dealing with things like when they start

02:20:18.950 --> 02:20:18.960
dealing with things like when they start
 

02:20:18.960 --> 02:20:21.200
dealing with things like when they start
talking about subatomic particles and

02:20:21.200 --> 02:20:21.210
talking about subatomic particles and
 

02:20:21.210 --> 02:20:22.730
talking about subatomic particles and
they start talking about the things that

02:20:22.730 --> 02:20:22.740
they start talking about the things that
 

02:20:22.740 --> 02:20:24.620
they start talking about the things that
they actually do know like the things

02:20:24.620 --> 02:20:24.630
they actually do know like the things
 

02:20:24.630 --> 02:20:26.060
they actually do know like the things
that you actually can measure you can

02:20:26.060 --> 02:20:26.070
that you actually can measure you can
 

02:20:26.070 --> 02:20:27.080
that you actually can measure you can
observe yeah yeah

02:20:27.080 --> 02:20:27.090
observe yeah yeah
 

02:20:27.090 --> 02:20:29.600
observe yeah yeah
like particles in superposition meaning

02:20:29.600 --> 02:20:29.610
like particles in superposition meaning
 

02:20:29.610 --> 02:20:31.460
like particles in superposition meaning
they're in movement and still at the

02:20:31.460 --> 02:20:31.470
they're in movement and still at the
 

02:20:31.470 --> 02:20:33.350
they're in movement and still at the
same time when they're talking about

02:20:33.350 --> 02:20:33.360
same time when they're talking about
 

02:20:33.360 --> 02:20:35.030
same time when they're talking about
things blinking in and out of existence

02:20:35.030 --> 02:20:35.040
things blinking in and out of existence
 

02:20:35.040 --> 02:20:37.100
things blinking in and out of existence
they go away and they don't know where

02:20:37.100 --> 02:20:37.110
they go away and they don't know where
 

02:20:37.110 --> 02:20:39.381
they go away and they don't know where
they went and then they come back with

02:20:39.381 --> 02:20:39.391
they went and then they come back with
 

02:20:39.391 --> 02:20:41.660
they went and then they come back with
just that alone the measurable stuff is

02:20:41.660 --> 02:20:41.670
just that alone the measurable stuff is
 

02:20:41.670 --> 02:20:44.780
just that alone the measurable stuff is
so crazy that the lowest point not the

02:20:44.780 --> 02:20:44.790
so crazy that the lowest point not the
 

02:20:44.790 --> 02:20:47.120
so crazy that the lowest point not the
lowest but the smallest measurable point

02:20:47.120 --> 02:20:47.130
lowest but the smallest measurable point
 

02:20:47.130 --> 02:20:50.841
lowest but the smallest measurable point

different places at the same time and
they can take particles and they can

02:21:03.051 --> 02:21:03.061
they can take particles and they can
 

02:21:03.061 --> 02:21:05.720
they can take particles and they can
move them across the world and when they

02:21:05.720 --> 02:21:05.730
move them across the world and when they
 

02:21:05.730 --> 02:21:07.131
move them across the world and when they
interact with each other they interact

02:21:07.131 --> 02:21:07.141
interact with each other they interact
 

02:21:07.141 --> 02:21:08.690
interact with each other they interact
with each other faster than you can

count faster than you can measure they
 

02:21:10.980 --> 02:21:12.220
count faster than you can measure they
interact with each other it like

02:21:12.220 --> 02:21:12.230
interact with each other it like
 

02:21:12.230 --> 02:21:16.250
interact with each other it like

kind of communication that we could have
 

02:21:17.760 --> 02:21:20.390
kind of communication that we could have
between these particles given the amount

02:21:20.390 --> 02:21:20.400
between these particles given the amount
 

02:21:20.400 --> 02:21:22.400
between these particles given the amount
of distances in between them the speed

instantaneously interacting with each
 

02:21:26.910 --> 02:21:29.240
instantaneously interacting with each
other now they're figuring out a way how

02:21:29.240 --> 02:21:29.250
other now they're figuring out a way how
 

02:21:29.250 --> 02:21:32.120
other now they're figuring out a way how
to send particles through time they're

02:21:32.120 --> 02:21:32.130
to send particles through time they're
 

02:21:32.130 --> 02:21:34.341
to send particles through time they're
figuring out ways to send particles

02:21:34.341 --> 02:21:34.351
figuring out ways to send particles
 

02:21:34.351 --> 02:21:36.620
figuring out ways to send particles
through time to actually time travel

02:21:36.620 --> 02:21:36.630
through time to actually time travel
 

02:21:36.630 --> 02:21:40.310
through time to actually time travel
with particles and so with all this

02:21:40.310 --> 02:21:40.320
with particles and so with all this
 

02:21:40.320 --> 02:21:41.960
with particles and so with all this
stuff that they're doing right now is

02:21:41.960 --> 02:21:41.970
stuff that they're doing right now is
 

02:21:41.970 --> 02:21:45.290
stuff that they're doing right now is
just one step on this never-ending quest

02:21:45.290 --> 02:21:45.300
just one step on this never-ending quest
 

02:21:45.300 --> 02:21:47.030
just one step on this never-ending quest
for technological innovation

02:21:47.030 --> 02:21:47.040
for technological innovation
 

02:21:47.040 --> 02:21:50.030
for technological innovation
there's never-ending quest where people

02:21:50.030 --> 02:21:50.040
there's never-ending quest where people
 

02:21:50.040 --> 02:21:51.200
there's never-ending quest where people
are trying to satisfy their curiosity

02:21:51.200 --> 02:21:51.210
are trying to satisfy their curiosity
 

02:21:51.210 --> 02:21:53.420
are trying to satisfy their curiosity
they're not gonna stop they're never

02:21:53.420 --> 02:21:53.430
they're not gonna stop they're never
 

02:21:53.430 --> 02:21:54.830
they're not gonna stop they're never
gonna stop if we don't get hit by an

02:21:54.830 --> 02:21:54.840
gonna stop if we don't get hit by an
 

02:21:54.840 --> 02:21:56.720
gonna stop if we don't get hit by an
asteroid if we don't get I think that's

02:21:56.720 --> 02:21:56.730
asteroid if we don't get I think that's
 

02:21:56.730 --> 02:21:57.980
asteroid if we don't get I think that's
right then that's you know and you get

02:21:57.980 --> 02:21:57.990
right then that's you know and you get
 

02:21:57.990 --> 02:21:59.240
right then that's you know and you get
all these good things coming from that

02:21:59.240 --> 02:21:59.250
all these good things coming from that
 

02:21:59.250 --> 02:22:00.860
all these good things coming from that
yeah along the way I mean I just I don't

02:22:00.860 --> 02:22:00.870
yeah along the way I mean I just I don't
 

02:22:00.870 --> 02:22:03.620
yeah along the way I mean I just I don't
understand it but eventually it leads to

02:22:03.620 --> 02:22:03.630
understand it but eventually it leads to
 

02:22:03.630 --> 02:22:06.710
understand it but eventually it leads to
things that we all can use and and deal

02:22:06.710 --> 02:22:06.720
things that we all can use and and deal
 

02:22:06.720 --> 02:22:07.910
things that we all can use and and deal
with and a lot of those things are

02:22:07.910 --> 02:22:07.920
with and a lot of those things are
 

02:22:07.920 --> 02:22:09.381
with and a lot of those things are
really good I don't think I think one

02:22:09.381 --> 02:22:09.391
really good I don't think I think one
 

02:22:09.391 --> 02:22:10.490
really good I don't think I think one
thing I would say about all this stuff

02:22:10.490 --> 02:22:10.500
thing I would say about all this stuff
 

02:22:10.500 --> 02:22:13.460
thing I would say about all this stuff
is that generally speaking we are not

02:22:13.460 --> 02:22:13.470
is that generally speaking we are not
 

02:22:13.470 --> 02:22:14.860
is that generally speaking we are not
critical enough

02:22:14.860 --> 02:22:14.870
critical enough
 

02:22:14.870 --> 02:22:16.780
critical enough
of the technological advances I think

02:22:16.780 --> 02:22:16.790
of the technological advances I think
 

02:22:16.790 --> 02:22:20.261
of the technological advances I think
that a lot of them are obviously you

02:22:20.261 --> 02:22:20.271
that a lot of them are obviously you
 

02:22:20.271 --> 02:22:21.880
that a lot of them are obviously you
know improvements you know if you think

02:22:21.880 --> 02:22:21.890
know improvements you know if you think
 

02:22:21.890 --> 02:22:23.470
know improvements you know if you think
about just technology going back many

02:22:23.470 --> 02:22:23.480
about just technology going back many
 

02:22:23.480 --> 02:22:25.330
about just technology going back many
years you know the way that I don't know

02:22:25.330 --> 02:22:25.340
years you know the way that I don't know
 

02:22:25.340 --> 02:22:27.450
years you know the way that I don't know
like labor-saving devices in the home

02:22:27.450 --> 02:22:27.460
like labor-saving devices in the home
 

02:22:27.460 --> 02:22:30.040
like labor-saving devices in the home
completely sort of freed women from the

02:22:30.040 --> 02:22:30.050
completely sort of freed women from the
 

02:22:30.050 --> 02:22:32.410
completely sort of freed women from the
drudgery in the horrific kind of washing

02:22:32.410 --> 02:22:32.420
drudgery in the horrific kind of washing
 

02:22:32.420 --> 02:22:33.761
drudgery in the horrific kind of washing
machine all that stuff that was just

02:22:33.761 --> 02:22:33.771
machine all that stuff that was just
 

02:22:33.771 --> 02:22:35.890
machine all that stuff that was just
kind of such a terrible experience and

02:22:35.890 --> 02:22:35.900
kind of such a terrible experience and
 

02:22:35.900 --> 02:22:38.740
kind of such a terrible experience and
that's all a fan that sort of simple

02:22:38.740 --> 02:22:38.750
that's all a fan that sort of simple
 

02:22:38.750 --> 02:22:41.020
that's all a fan that sort of simple
example of technology being really

02:22:41.020 --> 02:22:41.030
example of technology being really
 

02:22:41.030 --> 02:22:44.020
example of technology being really
transformational in a positive way and I

02:22:44.020 --> 02:22:44.030
transformational in a positive way and I
 

02:22:44.030 --> 02:22:45.820
transformational in a positive way and I
think generally that's probably true of

02:22:45.820 --> 02:22:45.830
think generally that's probably true of
 

02:22:45.830 --> 02:22:47.650
think generally that's probably true of
Technology it's usually an improvement

02:22:47.650 --> 02:22:47.660
Technology it's usually an improvement
 

02:22:47.660 --> 02:22:49.091
Technology it's usually an improvement
but I do think that we have this kind of

02:22:49.091 --> 02:22:49.101
but I do think that we have this kind of
 

02:22:49.101 --> 02:22:52.330
but I do think that we have this kind of
attitude of assuming it's good and just

02:22:52.330 --> 02:22:52.340
attitude of assuming it's good and just
 

02:22:52.340 --> 02:22:54.370
attitude of assuming it's good and just
and not really questioning it do we

02:22:54.370 --> 02:22:54.380
and not really questioning it do we
 

02:22:54.380 --> 02:22:56.230
and not really questioning it do we
really want that right I think that

02:22:56.230 --> 02:22:56.240
really want that right I think that
 

02:22:56.240 --> 02:22:58.091
really want that right I think that
doesn't happen enough often the answer

02:22:58.091 --> 02:22:58.101
doesn't happen enough often the answer
 

02:22:58.101 --> 02:22:59.440
doesn't happen enough often the answer
will be yeah we do that's great

02:22:59.440 --> 02:22:59.450
will be yeah we do that's great
 

02:22:59.450 --> 02:23:02.140
will be yeah we do that's great
fantastic bring it on but I don't think

02:23:02.140 --> 02:23:02.150
fantastic bring it on but I don't think
 

02:23:02.150 --> 02:23:03.880
fantastic bring it on but I don't think
we stop enough to ask the question and I

02:23:03.880 --> 02:23:03.890
we stop enough to ask the question and I
 

02:23:03.890 --> 02:23:05.020
we stop enough to ask the question and I
think there's the scientist and the

02:23:05.020 --> 02:23:05.030
think there's the scientist and the
 

02:23:05.030 --> 02:23:06.430
think there's the scientist and the
people doing this stuff they don't

02:23:06.430 --> 02:23:06.440
people doing this stuff they don't
 

02:23:06.440 --> 02:23:09.580
people doing this stuff they don't
really think about that they want to do

02:23:09.580 --> 02:23:09.590
really think about that they want to do
 

02:23:09.590 --> 02:23:11.410
really think about that they want to do
it because they can and it says you

02:23:11.410 --> 02:23:11.420

that's a lot of people feel like that's
 

02:29:54.560 --> 02:29:56.639
that's a lot of people feel like that's
where things are going to go yeah a

02:29:56.639 --> 02:29:56.649
where things are going to go yeah a
 

02:29:56.649 --> 02:29:59.110
where things are going to go yeah a
solution is really not fiction you know

02:29:59.110 --> 02:29:59.120
solution is really not fiction you know
 

02:29:59.120 --> 02:30:00.939
solution is really not fiction you know
it's definitely happening yeah I thought

02:30:00.939 --> 02:30:00.949
it's definitely happening yeah I thought
 

02:30:00.949 --> 02:30:04.990
it's definitely happening yeah I thought
the that why I don't talk to to friend

02:30:04.990 --> 02:30:05.000
the that why I don't talk to to friend
 

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:06.490
the that why I don't talk to to friend
of mine about this a quite a bit which

02:30:06.490 --> 02:30:06.500
of mine about this a quite a bit which
 

02:30:06.500 --> 02:30:08.830
of mine about this a quite a bit which
is if you think about I'm just

02:30:08.830 --> 02:30:08.840
is if you think about I'm just
 

02:30:08.840 --> 02:30:10.059
is if you think about I'm just
interested that there I got the

02:30:10.059 --> 02:30:10.069
interested that there I got the
 

02:30:10.069 --> 02:30:11.889
interested that there I got the
Unabomber that's an extreme example yeah

02:30:11.889 --> 02:30:11.899
Unabomber that's an extreme example yeah
 

02:30:11.899 --> 02:30:15.340
Unabomber that's an extreme example yeah
I wasn't I didn't realize that it was so

02:30:15.340 --> 02:30:15.350
I wasn't I didn't realize that it was so
 

02:30:15.350 --> 02:30:18.040
I wasn't I didn't realize that it was so
focused on technology but there isn't

02:30:18.040 --> 02:30:18.050
focused on technology but there isn't
 

02:30:18.050 --> 02:30:20.229
focused on technology but there isn't
really a people like it generally

02:30:20.229 --> 02:30:20.239
really a people like it generally
 

02:30:20.239 --> 02:30:21.550
really a people like it generally
speaking there wasn't really a movement

02:30:21.550 --> 02:30:21.560
speaking there wasn't really a movement
 

02:30:21.560 --> 02:30:24.189
speaking there wasn't really a movement
a sort of anti technology movement that

02:30:24.189 --> 02:30:24.199
a sort of anti technology movement that
 

02:30:24.199 --> 02:30:25.389
a sort of anti technology movement that
not certainly not that I'm aware of if

02:30:25.389 --> 02:30:25.399
not certainly not that I'm aware of if
 

02:30:25.399 --> 02:30:28.689
not certainly not that I'm aware of if
you think back to you know the exactly

02:30:28.689 --> 02:30:28.699
you think back to you know the exactly
 

02:30:28.699 --> 02:30:29.740
you think back to you know the exactly
when it was when you had this sort of

02:30:29.740 --> 02:30:29.750
when it was when you had this sort of
 

02:30:29.750 --> 02:30:31.210
when it was when you had this sort of
industrial revolution and the Luddites

02:30:31.210 --> 02:30:31.220
industrial revolution and the Luddites
 

02:30:31.220 --> 02:30:33.460
industrial revolution and the Luddites
you know smashing up machines that were

02:30:33.460 --> 02:30:33.470
you know smashing up machines that were
 

02:30:33.470 --> 02:30:35.800
you know smashing up machines that were
you know taking jobs away from people

02:30:35.800 --> 02:30:35.810
you know taking jobs away from people
 

02:30:35.810 --> 02:30:37.179
you know taking jobs away from people
and then their view really kind of

02:30:37.179 --> 02:30:37.189
and then their view really kind of
 

02:30:37.189 --> 02:30:39.099
and then their view really kind of
damaging society that was a it's kind of

02:30:39.099 --> 02:30:39.109
damaging society that was a it's kind of
 

02:30:39.109 --> 02:30:40.929
damaging society that was a it's kind of
quite a big movement yeah okay didn't

02:30:40.929 --> 02:30:40.939
quite a big movement yeah okay didn't
 

02:30:40.939 --> 02:30:42.820
quite a big movement yeah okay didn't
get anywhere and it you know history

02:30:42.820 --> 02:30:42.830
get anywhere and it you know history
 

02:30:42.830 --> 02:30:45.070
get anywhere and it you know history
sort of made them irrelevant but there

02:30:45.070 --> 02:30:45.080
sort of made them irrelevant but there
 

02:30:45.080 --> 02:30:46.840
sort of made them irrelevant but there
was a movement with a name and an

02:30:46.840 --> 02:30:46.850
was a movement with a name and an
 

02:30:46.850 --> 02:30:48.849
was a movement with a name and an
organization that did stuff what are

02:30:48.849 --> 02:30:48.859
organization that did stuff what are
 

02:30:48.859 --> 02:30:50.679
organization that did stuff what are
they what was their their idea Tecna

02:30:50.679 --> 02:30:50.689
they what was their their idea Tecna
 

02:30:50.689 --> 02:30:53.260
they what was their their idea Tecna
though I think that specifically it was

02:30:53.260 --> 02:30:53.270
though I think that specifically it was
 

02:30:53.270 --> 02:30:56.019
though I think that specifically it was
the the new equipment like the weaving

02:30:56.019 --> 02:30:56.029
the the new equipment like the weaving
 

02:30:56.029 --> 02:30:57.400
the the new equipment like the weaving
you know during the industrial

02:30:57.400 --> 02:30:57.410
you know during the industrial
 

02:30:57.410 --> 02:30:59.050
you know during the industrial
revolution in England then the machines

02:30:59.050 --> 02:30:59.060
revolution in England then the machines
 

02:30:59.060 --> 02:31:01.990
revolution in England then the machines
that were now being used to do the work

02:31:01.990 --> 02:31:02.000
that were now being used to do the work
 

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.120
that were now being used to do the work
that had been done by people and they

02:31:04.120 --> 02:31:04.130
that had been done by people and they
 

02:31:04.130 --> 02:31:05.830
that had been done by people and they
they objected to that and that

02:31:05.830 --> 02:31:05.840
they objected to that and that
 

02:31:05.840 --> 02:31:08.081
they objected to that and that
incredible and they would literally

02:31:08.081 --> 02:31:08.091
incredible and they would literally
 

02:31:08.091 --> 02:31:09.911
incredible and they would literally
physically smash up the machines that

02:31:09.911 --> 02:31:09.921
physically smash up the machines that
 

02:31:09.921 --> 02:31:11.350
physically smash up the machines that
was I think one of the things they did

02:31:11.350 --> 02:31:11.360
was I think one of the things they did
 

02:31:11.360 --> 02:31:13.211
was I think one of the things they did
and which all those people with a better

02:31:13.211 --> 02:31:13.221
and which all those people with a better
 

02:31:13.221 --> 02:31:15.341
and which all those people with a better
study of history that can give you a

02:31:15.341 --> 02:31:15.351
study of history that can give you a
 

02:31:15.351 --> 02:31:16.901
study of history that can give you a
better picture but that was they would

02:31:16.901 --> 02:31:16.911
better picture but that was they would
 

02:31:16.911 --> 02:31:18.220
better picture but that was they would
call the Luddites I think named after

02:31:18.220 --> 02:31:18.230
call the Luddites I think named after
 

02:31:18.230 --> 02:31:20.501
call the Luddites I think named after
the person that that set them up someone

02:31:20.501 --> 02:31:20.511
the person that that set them up someone
 

02:31:20.511 --> 02:31:26.291
the person that that set them up someone
called LOD I think and I don't know how

02:31:26.291 --> 02:31:26.301
called LOD I think and I don't know how
 

02:31:26.301 --> 02:31:28.331
called LOD I think and I don't know how
big it was but it was big enough that

02:31:28.331 --> 02:31:28.341
big it was but it was big enough that
 

02:31:28.341 --> 02:31:31.061
big it was but it was big enough that
it's something we still know about and

02:31:31.061 --> 02:31:31.071
it's something we still know about and
 

02:31:31.071 --> 02:31:33.100
it's something we still know about and
it's part of the history of that of that

02:31:33.100 --> 02:31:33.110
it's part of the history of that of that
 

02:31:33.110 --> 02:31:36.031
it's part of the history of that of that
era and there's nothing like that now

02:31:36.031 --> 02:31:36.041
era and there's nothing like that now
 

02:31:36.041 --> 02:31:39.011
era and there's nothing like that now
not not to my knowledge where you don't

02:31:39.011 --> 02:31:39.021
not not to my knowledge where you don't
 

02:31:39.021 --> 02:31:40.301
not not to my knowledge where you don't
have people going out and smashing up

02:31:40.301 --> 02:31:40.311
have people going out and smashing up
 

02:31:40.311 --> 02:31:42.461
have people going out and smashing up
cellphone towers no make a point about

02:31:42.461 --> 02:31:42.471
cellphone towers no make a point about
 

02:31:42.471 --> 02:31:44.801
cellphone towers no make a point about
technology well I think it's what we

02:31:44.801 --> 02:31:44.811
technology well I think it's what we
 

02:31:44.811 --> 02:31:46.361
technology well I think it's what we
were saying I really like it you know

02:31:46.361 --> 02:31:46.371
were saying I really like it you know
 

02:31:46.371 --> 02:31:48.731
were saying I really like it you know
it's kind of their lives and they like

02:31:48.731 --> 02:31:48.741
it's kind of their lives and they like
 

02:31:48.741 --> 02:31:50.890
it's kind of their lives and they like
it for the most part yeah I mean there's

02:31:50.890 --> 02:31:50.900
it for the most part yeah I mean there's
 

02:31:50.900 --> 02:31:52.211
it for the most part yeah I mean there's
a lot of benefits there's a lot of

02:31:52.211 --> 02:31:52.221
a lot of benefits there's a lot of
 

02:31:52.221 --> 02:31:54.640
a lot of benefits there's a lot of
benefits to technology but I think it's

02:31:54.640 --> 02:31:54.650
benefits to technology but I think it's
 

02:31:54.650 --> 02:31:56.341
benefits to technology but I think it's
what we were talking about earlier that

02:31:56.341 --> 02:31:56.351
what we were talking about earlier that
 

02:31:56.351 --> 02:32:00.401
what we were talking about earlier that
maybe back then they didn't have enough

02:32:00.401 --> 02:32:00.411
maybe back then they didn't have enough
 

02:32:00.411 --> 02:32:02.350
maybe back then they didn't have enough
information to draw upon and they saw it

02:32:02.350 --> 02:32:02.360
information to draw upon and they saw it
 

02:32:02.360 --> 02:32:04.451
information to draw upon and they saw it
as being this direct threat to their

02:32:04.451 --> 02:32:04.461
as being this direct threat to their
 

02:32:04.461 --> 02:32:06.071
as being this direct threat to their
livelihood yeah I think that was a big

02:32:06.071 --> 02:32:06.081
livelihood yeah I think that was a big
 

02:32:06.081 --> 02:32:09.071
livelihood yeah I think that was a big
part of it yeah and I think today we're

02:32:09.071 --> 02:32:09.081
part of it yeah and I think today we're
 

02:32:09.081 --> 02:32:12.161
part of it yeah and I think today we're
sort of forced into this realization

02:32:12.161 --> 02:32:12.171
sort of forced into this realization
 

02:32:12.171 --> 02:32:15.041
sort of forced into this realization
that it's neither good nor bad but

02:32:15.041 --> 02:32:15.051
that it's neither good nor bad but
 

02:32:15.051 --> 02:32:16.331
that it's neither good nor bad but
rather something that needs to be

02:32:16.331 --> 02:32:16.341
rather something that needs to be
 

02:32:16.341 --> 02:32:19.001
rather something that needs to be
managed and there's good aspects to it

02:32:19.001 --> 02:32:19.011
managed and there's good aspects to it
 

02:32:19.011 --> 02:32:20.861
managed and there's good aspects to it
and then there's negative aspects to it

02:32:20.861 --> 02:32:20.871
and then there's negative aspects to it
 

02:32:20.871 --> 02:32:22.751
and then there's negative aspects to it
and ultimately you have to figure out

02:32:22.751 --> 02:32:22.761
and ultimately you have to figure out
 

02:32:22.761 --> 02:32:26.081
and ultimately you have to figure out
what outweighs what and how to lean it

02:32:26.081 --> 02:32:26.091
what outweighs what and how to lean it
 

02:32:26.091 --> 02:32:28.991
what outweighs what and how to lean it
towards the positive how to manage it in

02:32:28.991 --> 02:32:29.001
towards the positive how to manage it in
 

02:32:29.001 --> 02:32:30.731
towards the positive how to manage it in
a way that it goes towards the positive

02:32:30.731 --> 02:32:30.741
a way that it goes towards the positive
 

02:32:30.741 --> 02:32:32.111
a way that it goes towards the positive
and I think that's the case we were

02:32:32.111 --> 02:32:32.121
and I think that's the case we were
 

02:32:32.121 --> 02:32:33.430
and I think that's the case we were
talking about with children watching

02:32:33.430 --> 02:32:33.440
talking about with children watching
 

02:32:33.440 --> 02:32:35.771
talking about with children watching
television you know I know there's the

02:32:35.771 --> 02:32:35.781
television you know I know there's the
 

02:32:35.781 --> 02:32:38.350
television you know I know there's the
Waldorf School my oldest daughter was in

02:32:38.350 --> 02:32:38.360
Waldorf School my oldest daughter was in
 

02:32:38.360 --> 02:32:39.640
Waldorf School my oldest daughter was in
the Waldorf school system for a while

02:32:39.640 --> 02:32:39.650
the Waldorf school system for a while
 

02:32:39.650 --> 02:32:42.220
the Waldorf school system for a while
and it's a lot of wackiness to that like

02:32:42.220 --> 02:32:42.230
and it's a lot of wackiness to that like
 

02:32:42.230 --> 02:32:43.331
and it's a lot of wackiness to that like
they didn't believe in any technology

02:32:43.331 --> 02:32:43.341
they didn't believe in any technology
 

02:32:43.341 --> 02:32:45.461
they didn't believe in any technology
didn't believe in any video games but

02:32:45.461 --> 02:32:45.471
didn't believe in any video games but
 

02:32:45.471 --> 02:32:47.441
didn't believe in any video games but
was it been they've proven that video

02:32:47.441 --> 02:32:47.451
was it been they've proven that video
 

02:32:47.451 --> 02:32:49.390
was it been they've proven that video
games can enhance cognitive function

02:32:49.390 --> 02:32:49.400
games can enhance cognitive function
 

02:32:49.400 --> 02:32:51.491
games can enhance cognitive function
then in the neural pathways that are

02:32:51.491 --> 02:32:51.501
then in the neural pathways that are
 

02:32:51.501 --> 02:32:53.921
then in the neural pathways that are
created by stimulating video games can

02:32:53.921 --> 02:32:53.931
created by stimulating video games can
 

02:32:53.931 --> 02:32:56.140
created by stimulating video games can
actually they're they mimic the games

02:32:56.140 --> 02:32:56.150
actually they're they mimic the games
 

02:32:56.150 --> 02:32:58.661
actually they're they mimic the games
like chess you know like problem-solving

02:32:58.661 --> 02:32:58.671
like chess you know like problem-solving
 

02:32:58.671 --> 02:33:00.791
like chess you know like problem-solving
games games that stimulate the

02:33:00.791 --> 02:33:00.801
games games that stimulate the
 

02:33:00.801 --> 02:33:02.890
games games that stimulate the
imagination and creativity like they

02:33:02.890 --> 02:33:02.900
imagination and creativity like they
 

02:33:02.900 --> 02:33:04.841
imagination and creativity like they
exist video games can be used in that

02:33:04.841 --> 02:33:04.851
exist video games can be used in that
 

02:33:04.851 --> 02:33:06.850
exist video games can be used in that
same function this idea that all video

02:33:06.850 --> 02:33:06.860
same function this idea that all video
 

02:33:06.860 --> 02:33:09.071
same function this idea that all video
games are bad and then I found out that

just in that sense animals well we
 

02:42:03.870 --> 02:42:05.450
just in that sense animals well we
certainly are and that makes it's the

02:42:05.450 --> 02:42:05.460
certainly are and that makes it's the
 

02:42:05.460 --> 02:42:07.610
certainly are and that makes it's the
same it's it's it's not it's not I don't

02:42:07.610 --> 02:42:07.620
same it's it's it's not it's not I don't
 

02:42:07.620 --> 02:42:09.200
same it's it's it's not it's not I don't
think we should be surprised that it's

02:42:09.200 --> 02:42:09.210
think we should be surprised that it's
 

02:42:09.210 --> 02:42:12.261
think we should be surprised that it's
such a dominant part of

02:42:12.261 --> 02:42:12.271
such a dominant part of
 

02:42:12.271 --> 02:42:14.780
such a dominant part of
of life no no we definitely shouldn't be

02:42:14.780 --> 02:42:14.790
of life no no we definitely shouldn't be
 

02:42:14.790 --> 02:42:16.280
of life no no we definitely shouldn't be
surprised but we're also much more

02:42:16.280 --> 02:42:16.290
surprised but we're also much more
 

02:42:16.290 --> 02:42:18.530
surprised but we're also much more
complex than the average animal that's

02:42:18.530 --> 02:42:18.540
complex than the average animal that's
 

02:42:18.540 --> 02:42:20.060
complex than the average animal that's

02:42:20.070 --> 02:42:21.591
where things get really weird where
things get really weird is that yes we

things get really weird is that yes we
 

02:42:21.601 --> 02:42:23.720
things get really weird is that yes we
are animals but we are also animals with

02:42:23.720 --> 02:42:23.730
are animals but we are also animals with
 

02:42:23.730 --> 02:42:24.410

we're also animals that are aware that

02:42:26.120 --> 02:42:26.130
we're also animals that are aware that
 

02:42:26.130 --> 02:42:27.560
we're also animals that are aware that
we're animals so we have to think about

02:42:27.560 --> 02:42:27.570
we're animals so we have to think about
 

02:42:27.570 --> 02:42:29.690
we're animals so we have to think about
our actions were self-aware we're aware

02:42:29.690 --> 02:42:29.700
our actions were self-aware we're aware
 

02:42:29.700 --> 02:42:31.610
our actions were self-aware we're aware
of the influence that others have on us

02:42:31.610 --> 02:42:31.620
of the influence that others have on us
 

02:42:31.620 --> 02:42:33.680
of the influence that others have on us
and we're constantly expanding that

02:42:33.680 --> 02:42:33.690
and we're constantly expanding that
 

02:42:33.690 --> 02:42:36.591
and we're constantly expanding that
influence you know so we're not just

02:42:36.591 --> 02:42:36.601

computers that may become part of
 

02:42:40.080 --> 02:42:42.261
computers that may become part of
machines that's the thing that freaks me

02:42:42.261 --> 02:42:42.271
machines that's the thing that freaks me
 

02:42:42.271 --> 02:42:44.390

the potential for developing artificial
 

02:42:48.630 --> 02:42:51.830
the potential for developing artificial
technology or artificial life I think

02:42:51.830 --> 02:42:51.840
technology or artificial life I think
 

02:42:51.840 --> 02:42:53.720
technology or artificial life I think
that we we give birth to that I mean

02:42:53.720 --> 02:42:53.730
that we we give birth to that I mean

02:43:09.921 --> 02:43:09.931
a technological cocoon thinking that
 

02:43:09.931 --> 02:43:12.320
a technological cocoon thinking that

we're just I'm doing my thing running
around and looking at porn no you know

02:43:14.360 --> 02:43:14.370
around and looking at porn no you know
 

02:43:14.370 --> 02:43:16.461

you're a part of this gigantic machine

02:43:16.461 --> 02:43:16.471
you're a part of this gigantic machine
 

02:43:16.471 --> 02:43:18.921
you're a part of this gigantic machine
that's processing and pushing for the

innovation of technology and the
innovation of technology will eventually

02:43:22.341 --> 02:43:22.351
innovation of technology will eventually
 

02:43:22.351 --> 02:43:24.320
innovation of technology will eventually
give birth to a life-form they're

02:43:24.320 --> 02:43:24.330
give birth to a life-form they're
 

02:43:24.330 --> 02:43:26.930
give birth to a life-form they're
constantly working on trying to map out

02:43:26.930 --> 02:43:26.940
constantly working on trying to map out
 

02:43:26.940 --> 02:43:28.310

the human mind yeah

02:43:28.310 --> 02:43:28.320
the human mind yeah
 

02:43:28.320 --> 02:43:29.810
the human mind yeah
duplicate the functions of the human

02:43:29.810 --> 02:43:29.820
duplicate the functions of the human
 

02:43:29.820 --> 02:43:31.400
duplicate the functions of the human
mind it's some sort of a synthetic

02:43:31.400 --> 02:43:31.410
mind it's some sort of a synthetic
 

02:43:31.410 --> 02:43:34.301
mind it's some sort of a synthetic
process and we're not anywhere close

02:43:34.301 --> 02:43:34.311
process and we're not anywhere close
 

02:43:34.311 --> 02:43:39.261
process and we're not anywhere close
right now but the way technology exactly

02:43:39.261 --> 02:43:39.271
right now but the way technology exactly
 

02:43:39.271 --> 02:43:41.810
right now but the way technology exactly
yeah it's it's it feels unlikely that

02:43:41.810 --> 02:43:41.820
yeah it's it's it feels unlikely that
 

02:43:41.820 --> 02:43:42.860
yeah it's it's it feels unlikely that
that's not gonna happen

02:43:42.860 --> 02:43:42.870
that's not gonna happen
 

02:43:42.870 --> 02:43:45.051
that's not gonna happen
yeah I heard this I read this article by

02:43:45.051 --> 02:43:45.061
yeah I heard this I read this article by
 

02:43:45.061 --> 02:43:46.461
yeah I heard this I read this article by

mind and he was talking about the
 

02:43:58.141 --> 02:43:59.600

complicated functions the human brought

02:43:59.600 --> 02:43:59.610
complicated functions the human brought
 

02:43:59.610 --> 02:44:01.280

that stuff is great if you're using a
body but this guy was so hung up on the

02:44:39.530 --> 02:44:39.540
body but this guy was so hung up on the
 

02:44:39.540 --> 02:44:41.780
body but this guy was so hung up on the
fact that Kurzweil is wrong because we

02:44:41.780 --> 02:44:41.790
fact that Kurzweil is wrong because we
 

02:44:41.790 --> 02:44:43.160
fact that Kurzweil is wrong because we
don't understand how the human body

02:44:43.160 --> 02:44:43.170
don't understand how the human body

don't understand how the human body
works well no no he's not because he's

02:44:46.460 --> 02:44:46.470
works well no no he's not because he's

just you're just talking about bodies

02:44:48.230 --> 02:44:48.240
just you're just talking about bodies
 

02:44:48.240 --> 02:44:49.700
just you're just talking about bodies
yeah bodies are super complicated we

02:44:49.700 --> 02:44:49.710
yeah bodies are super complicated we
 

02:44:49.710 --> 02:44:51.261
yeah bodies are super complicated we
haven't totally figured it out yet but

02:44:51.261 --> 02:44:51.271
haven't totally figured it out yet but
 

02:44:51.271 --> 02:44:53.150
haven't totally figured it out yet but
we might not have to if we can figure

02:44:53.150 --> 02:44:53.160
we might not have to if we can figure
 

02:44:53.160 --> 02:44:54.620
we might not have to if we can figure
out a way to do all the things that the

02:44:54.620 --> 02:44:54.630
out a way to do all the things that the
 

02:44:54.630 --> 02:44:57.020
out a way to do all the things that the
body does but do it with a computer or

that you're bitching about you're just

02:45:21.530 --> 02:45:21.540
that you're bitching about you're just
 

02:45:21.540 --> 02:45:23.120
that you're bitching about you're just
bitching because you're showing your

02:45:23.120 --> 02:45:23.130
bitching because you're showing your
 

02:45:23.130 --> 02:45:24.350
bitching because you're showing your
intelligence you're trying to show

02:45:24.350 --> 02:45:24.360
intelligence you're trying to show
 

02:45:24.360 --> 02:45:26.390
intelligence you're trying to show
people how smart you are by criticizing

02:45:26.390 --> 02:45:26.400
people how smart you are by criticizing
 

02:45:26.400 --> 02:45:28.100
people how smart you are by criticizing
a known genius because you're not a

02:45:28.100 --> 02:45:28.110
a known genius because you're not a
 

02:45:28.110 --> 02:45:30.170
a known genius because you're not a
known genius I mean that's essentially

02:45:30.170 --> 02:45:30.180
known genius I mean that's essentially
 

02:45:30.180 --> 02:45:31.460
known genius I mean that's essentially
what you're doing yeah and it seems to

02:45:31.460 --> 02:45:31.470
what you're doing yeah and it seems to
 

02:45:31.470 --> 02:45:33.350
what you're doing yeah and it seems to
just superficial I know nothing about it

02:45:33.350 --> 02:45:33.360
just superficial I know nothing about it
 

02:45:33.360 --> 02:45:36.801
just superficial I know nothing about it
but the the the body part of it feels

02:45:36.801 --> 02:45:36.811
but the the the body part of it feels
 

02:45:36.811 --> 02:45:38.570
but the the the body part of it feels
like the you know that there's a ton of

02:45:38.570 --> 02:45:38.580
like the you know that there's a ton of
 

02:45:38.580 --> 02:45:39.860
like the you know that there's a ton of
progress right there they sort of

02:45:39.860 --> 02:45:39.870
progress right there they sort of
 

02:45:39.870 --> 02:45:41.810
progress right there they sort of
biomechanics and robotics and so that is

02:45:41.810 --> 02:45:41.820
biomechanics and robotics and so that is
 

02:45:41.820 --> 02:45:44.540
biomechanics and robotics and so that is
easy compared to the brain yeah yeah no

02:45:44.540 --> 02:45:44.550
easy compared to the brain yeah yeah no
 

02:45:44.550 --> 02:45:47.780
easy compared to the brain yeah yeah no
I agree it is the the what's what they

02:45:47.780 --> 02:45:47.790
I agree it is the the what's what they
 

02:45:47.790 --> 02:45:49.640
I agree it is the the what's what they
do know about the mind and they do know

02:45:49.640 --> 02:45:49.650
do know about the mind and they do know
 

02:45:49.650 --> 02:45:52.640
do know about the mind and they do know
about the body is comparatively

02:45:52.640 --> 02:45:52.650
about the body is comparatively
 

02:45:52.650 --> 02:45:55.070
about the body is comparatively
rudimentary when you think about what we

02:45:55.070 --> 02:45:55.080
rudimentary when you think about what we
 

02:45:55.080 --> 02:45:57.051
rudimentary when you think about what we
know about a clock mm-hmm we know

02:45:57.051 --> 02:45:57.061
know about a clock mm-hmm we know
 

02:45:57.061 --> 02:45:58.430
know about a clock mm-hmm we know
everything about a clock you know you

02:45:58.430 --> 02:45:58.440
everything about a clock you know you
 

02:45:58.440 --> 02:46:00.080
everything about a clock you know you
could buy a switch watch a Swiss watch

02:46:00.080 --> 02:46:00.090
could buy a switch watch a Swiss watch
 

02:46:00.090 --> 02:46:02.420
could buy a switch watch a Swiss watch
and there's a man out there that knows

02:46:02.420 --> 02:46:02.430
and there's a man out there that knows
 

02:46:02.430 --> 02:46:04.160
and there's a man out there that knows
every single function of that watch

02:46:04.160 --> 02:46:04.170
every single function of that watch

what's going on tick tock tick tock we

02:46:09.200 --> 02:46:09.210
what's going on tick tock tick tock we
 

02:46:09.210 --> 02:46:10.341

don't know that about the body yet

02:46:10.341 --> 02:46:10.351
don't know that about the body yet
 

02:46:10.351 --> 02:46:11.810
don't know that about the body yet
you're right you're correct but we're

02:46:11.810 --> 02:46:11.820
you're right you're correct but we're
 

02:46:11.820 --> 02:46:13.580
you're right you're correct but we're
not gonna have to we're not gonna have

that's way stronger than a mind and it's
 

02:46:19.440 --> 02:46:21.560
that's way stronger than a mind and it's
gonna be artificial and one day it's

02:46:21.560 --> 02:46:21.570
gonna be artificial and one day it's
 

02:46:21.570 --> 02:46:24.020
gonna be artificial and one day it's

like this no just kind of going on
momentum just just how we do it I don't

02:46:33.110 --> 02:46:33.120
momentum just just how we do it I don't
 

02:46:33.120 --> 02:46:34.400
momentum just just how we do it I don't
think this is the best way to go about

02:46:34.400 --> 02:46:34.410
think this is the best way to go about
 

02:46:34.410 --> 02:46:36.650
think this is the best way to go about
this I don't think so either I have a

02:46:36.650 --> 02:46:36.660
this I don't think so either I have a
 

02:46:36.660 --> 02:46:38.900

to take over and then we're gonna have
 

02:46:40.980 --> 02:46:42.530
to take over and then we're gonna have
real problems and he's gonna really

02:46:42.530 --> 02:46:42.540
real problems and he's gonna really
 

02:46:42.540 --> 02:46:47.030
real problems and he's gonna really

what's not there was a guy once and I've
 

02:46:52.710 --> 02:46:55.671
what's not there was a guy once and I've
brought this up before but it's it's

02:46:55.671 --> 02:46:55.681
brought this up before but it's it's
 

02:46:55.681 --> 02:46:57.110
brought this up before but it's it's
important to note there was a guy that

02:46:57.110 --> 02:46:57.120
important to note there was a guy that
 

02:46:57.120 --> 02:46:59.301
important to note there was a guy that
we we talked about in the podcast who

02:46:59.301 --> 02:46:59.311
we we talked about in the podcast who
 

02:46:59.311 --> 02:47:00.770
we we talked about in the podcast who
had been bitten by a shark and the shark

02:47:00.770 --> 02:47:00.780
had been bitten by a shark and the shark
 

02:47:00.780 --> 02:47:03.230
had been bitten by a shark and the shark
had taken his arm and taken his leg and

02:47:03.230 --> 02:47:03.240
had taken his arm and taken his leg and
 

02:47:03.240 --> 02:47:05.511
had taken his arm and taken his leg and
he had this carbon arm and he was moving

02:47:05.511 --> 02:47:05.521
he had this carbon arm and he was moving
 

02:47:05.521 --> 02:47:06.801
he had this carbon arm and he was moving
his fingers around it and he was

02:47:06.801 --> 02:47:06.811
his fingers around it and he was
 

02:47:06.811 --> 02:47:08.720
his fingers around it and he was
standing there talking with this fake

02:47:08.720 --> 02:47:08.730
standing there talking with this fake
 

02:47:08.730 --> 02:47:10.761
standing there talking with this fake
arm his fake leg about how great it is

02:47:10.761 --> 02:47:10.771
arm his fake leg about how great it is
 

02:47:10.771 --> 02:47:12.410
arm his fake leg about how great it is
the technology has provided him with a

02:47:12.410 --> 02:47:12.420
the technology has provided him with a
 

02:47:12.420 --> 02:47:15.680
the technology has provided him with a
way to still be mobile and functional

02:47:15.680 --> 02:47:15.690
way to still be mobile and functional
 

02:47:15.690 --> 02:47:16.820
way to still be mobile and functional
even though he had been attacked by a

02:47:16.820 --> 02:47:16.830
even though he had been attacked by a
 

02:47:16.830 --> 02:47:18.860
even though he had been attacked by a
shark and I was sitting there and I was

02:47:18.860 --> 02:47:18.870
shark and I was sitting there and I was
 

02:47:18.870 --> 02:47:20.120
shark and I was sitting there and I was
thinking wow this is fascinating this

02:47:20.120 --> 02:47:20.130
thinking wow this is fascinating this
 

02:47:20.130 --> 02:47:23.301
thinking wow this is fascinating this
guy is like kind of a cyborg what we see

02:47:23.301 --> 02:47:23.311
guy is like kind of a cyborg what we see
 

02:47:23.311 --> 02:47:25.131
guy is like kind of a cyborg what we see
is a man with an artificial arm and the

02:47:25.131 --> 02:47:25.141
is a man with an artificial arm and the
 

02:47:25.141 --> 02:47:27.680
is a man with an artificial arm and the
story was about how well they had

02:47:27.680 --> 02:47:27.690
story was about how well they had
 

02:47:27.690 --> 02:47:29.240
story was about how well they had
created this arm to the point where this

02:47:29.240 --> 02:47:29.250
created this arm to the point where this
 

02:47:29.250 --> 02:47:31.970
created this arm to the point where this
guy was living a totally normal life and

02:47:31.970 --> 02:47:31.980
guy was living a totally normal life and
 

02:47:31.980 --> 02:47:35.631
guy was living a totally normal life and
you know was functional and mobile and

02:47:35.631 --> 02:47:35.641
you know was functional and mobile and
 

02:47:35.641 --> 02:47:36.711
you know was functional and mobile and
can take care of himself

02:47:36.711 --> 02:47:36.721
can take care of himself
 

02:47:36.721 --> 02:47:38.450
can take care of himself
even though his arm had been bitten off

02:47:38.450 --> 02:47:38.460
even though his arm had been bitten off
 

02:47:38.460 --> 02:47:40.490
even though his arm had been bitten off
by a monster and then I thought about

02:47:40.490 --> 02:47:40.500
by a monster and then I thought about
 

02:47:40.500 --> 02:47:43.041
by a monster and then I thought about
well what if it was both legs okay and

02:47:43.041 --> 02:47:43.051
well what if it was both legs okay and
 

02:47:43.051 --> 02:47:44.180
well what if it was both legs okay and
then they figured out artificial legs

02:47:44.180 --> 02:47:44.190
then they figured out artificial legs
 

02:47:44.190 --> 02:47:45.950
then they figured out artificial legs
who would say no to that nobody give him

02:47:45.950 --> 02:47:45.960
who would say no to that nobody give him
 

02:47:45.960 --> 02:47:47.150
who would say no to that nobody give him
some artificial legs now you can move

02:47:47.150 --> 02:47:47.160
some artificial legs now you can move
 

02:47:47.160 --> 02:47:48.591
some artificial legs now you can move
around okay what if it was this whole

02:47:48.591 --> 02:47:48.601
around okay what if it was this whole
 

02:47:48.601 --> 02:47:50.421
around okay what if it was this whole
body would say listen man we're gonna

02:47:50.421 --> 02:47:50.431
body would say listen man we're gonna
 

02:47:50.431 --> 02:47:51.560
body would say listen man we're gonna
take your head we're gonna stick it on a

02:47:51.560 --> 02:47:51.570
take your head we're gonna stick it on a
 

02:47:51.570 --> 02:47:53.001
take your head we're gonna stick it on a
robot body but you're still gonna be you

02:47:53.001 --> 02:47:53.011
robot body but you're still gonna be you
 

02:47:53.011 --> 02:47:56.570
robot body but you're still gonna be you
oh okay all right I'll take it

02:47:56.570 --> 02:47:56.580
oh okay all right I'll take it
 

02:47:56.580 --> 02:47:58.341
oh okay all right I'll take it
okay we're sticking your head on a robot

02:47:58.341 --> 02:47:58.351
okay we're sticking your head on a robot
 

02:47:58.351 --> 02:48:00.440
okay we're sticking your head on a robot
body but listen we got a problem the

02:48:00.440 --> 02:48:00.450
body but listen we got a problem the
 

02:48:00.450 --> 02:48:02.480
body but listen we got a problem the
robot body is rejecting your brain but

02:48:02.480 --> 02:48:02.490
robot body is rejecting your brain but
 

02:48:02.490 --> 02:48:04.761
robot body is rejecting your brain but
we found an artificial brain that works

02:48:04.761 --> 02:48:04.771
we found an artificial brain that works
 

02:48:04.771 --> 02:48:05.930
we found an artificial brain that works
just like your brain we're gonna

02:48:05.930 --> 02:48:05.940
just like your brain we're gonna
 

02:48:05.940 --> 02:48:07.310
just like your brain we're gonna
download your consciousness to this

02:48:07.310 --> 02:48:07.320
download your consciousness to this
 

02:48:07.320 --> 02:48:09.020
download your consciousness to this
artificial brain you won't even know the

02:48:09.020 --> 02:48:09.030
artificial brain you won't even know the
 

02:48:09.030 --> 02:48:12.200
artificial brain you won't even know the
difference okay well then who are you

02:48:12.200 --> 02:48:12.210
difference okay well then who are you
 

02:48:12.210 --> 02:48:14.810
difference okay well then who are you
and what are you what are you are you a

02:48:14.810 --> 02:48:14.820
and what are you what are you are you a
 

02:48:14.820 --> 02:48:17.720
and what are you what are you are you a
person still if you are your thoughts

02:48:17.720 --> 02:48:17.730
person still if you are your thoughts
 

02:48:17.730 --> 02:48:21.080
person still if you are your thoughts
and your personality and your memories

02:48:21.080 --> 02:48:21.090
and your personality and your memories
 

02:48:21.090 --> 02:48:24.591

of a new thing that they've done that

02:48:26.961 --> 02:48:26.971
of a new thing that they've done that
 

02:48:26.971 --> 02:48:29.541
of a new thing that they've done that
mimics all the functions of the human

02:48:29.541 --> 02:48:29.551
mimics all the functions of the human
 

02:48:29.551 --> 02:48:31.820

limitations what are you yeah I remember

02:48:34.761 --> 02:48:34.771
limitations what are you yeah I remember
 

02:48:34.771 --> 02:48:36.140
limitations what are you yeah I remember
that it's so funny you talking about

02:48:36.140 --> 02:48:36.150
that it's so funny you talking about
 

02:48:36.150 --> 02:48:38.270
that it's so funny you talking about
that because it reminds me years ago

02:48:38.270 --> 02:48:38.280
that because it reminds me years ago
 

02:48:38.280 --> 02:48:40.461
that because it reminds me years ago
when I was doing my interviews to go to

02:48:40.461 --> 02:48:40.471
when I was doing my interviews to go to
 

02:48:40.471 --> 02:48:42.140
when I was doing my interviews to go to
Oxford University and I had an interview

02:48:42.140 --> 02:48:42.150
Oxford University and I had an interview
 

02:48:42.150 --> 02:48:45.171
Oxford University and I had an interview
with a philosophy professor and he gave

02:48:45.171 --> 02:48:45.181
with a philosophy professor and he gave
 

02:48:45.181 --> 02:48:47.660
with a philosophy professor and he gave
me this scenario which I now know is a

02:48:47.660 --> 02:48:47.670
me this scenario which I now know is a
 

02:48:47.670 --> 02:48:49.490
me this scenario which I now know is a
famous philosophical thing is called the

02:48:49.490 --> 02:48:49.500
famous philosophical thing is called the
 

02:48:49.500 --> 02:48:51.501
famous philosophical thing is called the
experience machine and this is this

02:48:51.501 --> 02:48:51.511
experience machine and this is this
 

02:48:51.511 --> 02:48:52.700
experience machine and this is this
construct very much like what you're

02:48:52.700 --> 02:48:52.710
construct very much like what you're
 

02:48:52.710 --> 02:48:53.540
construct very much like what you're
talking about which is like

02:48:53.540 --> 02:48:53.550
talking about which is like
 

02:48:53.550 --> 02:48:55.550
talking about which is like
we could put you in a machine that gave

02:48:55.550 --> 02:48:55.560
we could put you in a machine that gave
 

02:48:55.560 --> 02:48:58.099
we could put you in a machine that gave
you all the experiences of a fantastic

02:48:58.099 --> 02:48:58.109
you all the experiences of a fantastic
 

02:48:58.109 --> 02:49:00.410
you all the experiences of a fantastic
life but it would be a machine doing it

02:49:00.410 --> 02:49:00.420
life but it would be a machine doing it
 

02:49:00.420 --> 02:49:02.870
life but it would be a machine doing it
would you choose to do it and I remember

02:49:02.870 --> 02:49:02.880
would you choose to do it and I remember
 

02:49:02.880 --> 02:49:05.420
would you choose to do it and I remember
saying no that's I wouldn't want to do

02:49:05.420 --> 02:49:05.430
saying no that's I wouldn't want to do
 

02:49:05.430 --> 02:49:07.639
saying no that's I wouldn't want to do
that because I'd feel I'd want to have

02:49:07.639 --> 02:49:07.649
that because I'd feel I'd want to have
 

02:49:07.649 --> 02:49:09.650
that because I'd feel I'd want to have
really expert Don it myself and if

02:49:09.650 --> 02:49:09.660
really expert Don it myself and if
 

02:49:09.660 --> 02:49:11.000
really expert Don it myself and if
you're just in a machine that's not the

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:11.010
you're just in a machine that's not the
 

02:49:11.010 --> 02:49:12.200
you're just in a machine that's not the
same thing either what if the machine

02:49:12.200 --> 02:49:12.210
same thing either what if the machine
 

02:49:12.210 --> 02:49:14.660
same thing either what if the machine
made you feel like that you were and

02:49:14.660 --> 02:49:14.670
made you feel like that you were and
 

02:49:14.670 --> 02:49:16.280
made you feel like that you were and
you've been on an a whatever I said

02:49:16.280 --> 02:49:16.290
you've been on an a whatever I said
 

02:49:16.290 --> 02:49:18.080
you've been on an a whatever I said
there was some kind of comeback and in

02:49:18.080 --> 02:49:18.090
there was some kind of comeback and in
 

02:49:18.090 --> 02:49:19.070
there was some kind of comeback and in
the end I just remember getting really

02:49:19.070 --> 02:49:19.080
the end I just remember getting really
 

02:49:19.080 --> 02:49:20.929
the end I just remember getting really
frustrated ah I don't know that's why I

02:49:20.929 --> 02:49:20.939
frustrated ah I don't know that's why I
 

02:49:20.939 --> 02:49:22.309
frustrated ah I don't know that's why I
want to come and learn about philosophy

02:49:22.309 --> 02:49:22.319
want to come and learn about philosophy
 

02:49:22.319 --> 02:49:23.840
want to come and learn about philosophy
so I can figure this stuff out but I

02:49:23.840 --> 02:49:23.850
so I can figure this stuff out but I
 

02:49:23.850 --> 02:49:26.450
so I can figure this stuff out but I
have no idea I lost my temper I never

02:49:26.450 --> 02:49:26.460
have no idea I lost my temper I never
 

02:49:26.460 --> 02:49:27.679
have no idea I lost my temper I never
did figure it out did you throw your

02:49:27.679 --> 02:49:27.689
did figure it out did you throw your
 

02:49:27.689 --> 02:49:31.670
did figure it out did you throw your
phone way before the phone here but it

02:49:31.670 --> 02:49:31.680
phone way before the phone here but it
 

02:49:31.680 --> 02:49:33.800
phone way before the phone here but it
was just there comes a point when I just

02:49:33.800 --> 02:49:33.810
was just there comes a point when I just
 

02:49:33.810 --> 02:49:38.750
was just there comes a point when I just
find it really hard to even go very far

02:49:38.750 --> 02:49:38.760
find it really hard to even go very far
 

02:49:38.760 --> 02:49:39.980
find it really hard to even go very far
with this and I just think oh well

02:49:39.980 --> 02:49:39.990
with this and I just think oh well
 

02:49:39.990 --> 02:49:41.300
with this and I just think oh well
whatever let's just sort of get on with

02:49:41.300 --> 02:49:41.310
whatever let's just sort of get on with
 

02:49:41.310 --> 02:49:43.790
whatever let's just sort of get on with
you know practical life today well it's

02:49:43.790 --> 02:49:43.800
you know practical life today well it's
 

02:49:43.800 --> 02:49:46.610
you know practical life today well it's
essentially it's the Dunbar's number of

02:49:46.610 --> 02:49:46.620
essentially it's the Dunbar's number of
 

02:49:46.620 --> 02:49:48.620
essentially it's the Dunbar's number of
philosophical discussion our minds are

02:49:48.620 --> 02:49:48.630
philosophical discussion our minds are
 

02:49:48.630 --> 02:49:52.250
philosophical discussion our minds are
limited in our ability to sort of take

02:49:52.250 --> 02:49:52.260
limited in our ability to sort of take
 

02:49:52.260 --> 02:49:54.679
limited in our ability to sort of take
these ideas in there we don't have the

02:49:54.679 --> 02:49:54.689
these ideas in there we don't have the
 

02:49:54.689 --> 02:49:58.639
these ideas in there we don't have the
capacity to extrapolate it's it's too

02:49:58.639 --> 02:49:58.649
capacity to extrapolate it's it's too
 

02:49:58.649 --> 02:50:01.820
capacity to extrapolate it's it's too
much so this this concept of recreating

02:50:01.820 --> 02:50:01.830
much so this this concept of recreating
 

02:50:01.830 --> 02:50:04.190
much so this this concept of recreating
reality in an indistinguishable manner

02:50:04.190 --> 02:50:04.200
reality in an indistinguishable manner
 

02:50:04.200 --> 02:50:08.030
reality in an indistinguishable manner
it's too weird it's too but I think it's

02:50:08.030 --> 02:50:08.040
it's too weird it's too but I think it's
 

02:50:08.040 --> 02:50:09.650
it's too weird it's too but I think it's
something we better start talking about

02:50:09.650 --> 02:50:09.660
something we better start talking about
 

02:50:09.660 --> 02:50:11.840
something we better start talking about
because it's common yeah I know I know

02:50:11.840 --> 02:50:11.850
because it's common yeah I know I know
 

02:50:11.850 --> 02:50:13.429
because it's common yeah I know I know
I'm really happy that you are nothing

02:50:13.429 --> 02:50:13.439
I'm really happy that you are nothing
 

02:50:13.439 --> 02:50:14.690
I'm really happy that you are nothing
it's really important that other people

02:50:14.690 --> 02:50:14.700
it's really important that other people
 

02:50:14.700 --> 02:50:16.820
it's really important that other people
are I'm just saying I'm not it's way

02:50:16.820 --> 02:50:16.830
are I'm just saying I'm not it's way
 

02:50:16.830 --> 02:50:18.080
are I'm just saying I'm not it's way
more important than other people are

02:50:18.080 --> 02:50:18.090
more important than other people are
 

02:50:18.090 --> 02:50:23.179
more important than other people are
doing it than me in hierarchy yes and

02:50:23.179 --> 02:50:23.189
doing it than me in hierarchy yes and
 

02:50:23.189 --> 02:50:24.380
doing it than me in hierarchy yes and
you've read more about it the night I

02:50:24.380 --> 02:50:24.390
you've read more about it the night I
 

02:50:24.390 --> 02:50:27.679
you've read more about it the night I
have and I just think that is yeah it's

02:50:27.679 --> 02:50:27.689
have and I just think that is yeah it's
 

02:50:27.689 --> 02:50:30.500
have and I just think that is yeah it's
really important that that generally we

02:50:30.500 --> 02:50:30.510
really important that that generally we
 

02:50:30.510 --> 02:50:33.139
really important that that generally we
talk about it and keep you know a really

02:50:33.139 --> 02:50:33.149
talk about it and keep you know a really
 

02:50:33.149 --> 02:50:35.210
talk about it and keep you know a really
strong sense of awareness of how these

02:50:35.210 --> 02:50:35.220
strong sense of awareness of how these
 

02:50:35.220 --> 02:50:38.389
strong sense of awareness of how these
things might change stuff and a lot of

02:50:38.389 --> 02:50:38.399
things might change stuff and a lot of
 

02:50:38.399 --> 02:50:39.559
things might change stuff and a lot of
the time it will be for the better and

02:50:39.559 --> 02:50:39.569
the time it will be for the better and
 

02:50:39.569 --> 02:50:40.670
the time it will be for the better and
that's great but we should just talk

02:50:40.670 --> 02:50:40.680
that's great but we should just talk
 

02:50:40.680 --> 02:50:42.530
that's great but we should just talk
about it well I had the opportunity to

02:50:42.530 --> 02:50:42.540
about it well I had the opportunity to
 

02:50:42.540 --> 02:50:44.270
about it well I had the opportunity to
talk to Kurzweil for an hour and a half

02:50:44.270 --> 02:50:44.280
talk to Kurzweil for an hour and a half
 

02:50:44.280 --> 02:50:45.860
talk to Kurzweil for an hour and a half
and I sat down and interviewed him about

02:50:45.860 --> 02:50:45.870
and I sat down and interviewed him about
 

02:50:45.870 --> 02:50:47.059
and I sat down and interviewed him about
these things and it was really

02:50:47.059 --> 02:50:47.069
these things and it was really
 

02:50:47.069 --> 02:50:48.530
these things and it was really
fascinating we had a great conversation

02:50:48.530 --> 02:50:48.540
fascinating we had a great conversation
 

02:50:48.540 --> 02:50:51.920
fascinating we had a great conversation
but this guy is not thinking about

02:50:51.920 --> 02:50:51.930
but this guy is not thinking about
 

02:50:51.930 --> 02:50:54.530
but this guy is not thinking about
negatives at all all he's thinking is a

02:50:54.530 --> 02:50:54.540
negatives at all all he's thinking is a
 

02:50:54.540 --> 02:50:58.580
negatives at all all he's thinking is a
gung-ho right full-blast pedal to the

02:50:58.580 --> 02:50:58.590
gung-ho right full-blast pedal to the
 

02:50:58.590 --> 02:51:01.280
gung-ho right full-blast pedal to the
metal he mean he's taking like he takes

02:51:01.280 --> 02:51:01.290
metal he mean he's taking like he takes
 

02:51:01.290 --> 02:51:04.250
metal he mean he's taking like he takes
giant bags of supplements every day

02:51:04.250 --> 02:51:04.260
giant bags of supplements every day
 

02:51:04.260 --> 02:51:05.700
giant bags of supplements every day
because he's an older man

02:51:05.700 --> 02:51:05.710
because he's an older man
 

02:51:05.710 --> 02:51:07.800
because he's an older man
he's just trying to keep his biology

02:51:07.800 --> 02:51:07.810
he's just trying to keep his biology
 

02:51:07.810 --> 02:51:11.340
he's just trying to keep his biology
alive long enough to see this this new

02:51:11.340 --> 02:51:11.350
alive long enough to see this this new
 

02:51:11.350 --> 02:51:14.760
alive long enough to see this this new
birth of technology and when it gets

02:51:14.760 --> 02:51:14.770
birth of technology and when it gets
 

02:51:14.770 --> 02:51:16.860
birth of technology and when it gets
really crazy what he's trying to do also

02:51:16.860 --> 02:51:16.870
really crazy what he's trying to do also
 

02:51:16.870 --> 02:51:20.700
really crazy what he's trying to do also
is he's trying to make his father come

02:51:20.700 --> 02:51:20.710
is he's trying to make his father come
 

02:51:20.710 --> 02:51:23.610
is he's trying to make his father come
back to life his father died when he was

02:51:23.610 --> 02:51:23.620
back to life his father died when he was
 

02:51:23.620 --> 02:51:26.400
back to life his father died when he was
young and he believes that if they

02:51:26.400 --> 02:51:26.410
young and he believes that if they
 

02:51:26.410 --> 02:51:29.610
young and he believes that if they
figure out a way to recreate a person

02:51:29.610 --> 02:51:29.620
figure out a way to recreate a person
 

02:51:29.620 --> 02:51:33.059
figure out a way to recreate a person
from memories from just the the

02:51:33.059 --> 02:51:33.069
from memories from just the the
 

02:51:33.069 --> 02:51:35.130
from memories from just the the
knowledge of who this person was images

02:51:35.130 --> 02:51:35.140
knowledge of who this person was images
 

02:51:35.140 --> 02:51:37.710
knowledge of who this person was images
that you're going to be able to recreate

02:51:37.710 --> 02:51:37.720
that you're going to be able to recreate
 

02:51:37.720 --> 02:51:39.540
that you're going to be able to recreate
this guy in some sort of an artificial

02:51:39.540 --> 02:51:39.550
this guy in some sort of an artificial
 

02:51:39.550 --> 02:51:41.580
this guy in some sort of an artificial
form I mean it's one of the things he's

02:51:41.580 --> 02:51:41.590
form I mean it's one of the things he's
 

02:51:41.590 --> 02:51:43.500
form I mean it's one of the things he's
discussed is this he wants to see his

02:51:43.500 --> 02:51:43.510
discussed is this he wants to see his
 

02:51:43.510 --> 02:51:45.570
discussed is this he wants to see his
father again and the idea that he can

02:51:45.570 --> 02:51:45.580
father again and the idea that he can
 

02:51:45.580 --> 02:51:49.130
father again and the idea that he can
recreate his father technologically from

02:51:49.130 --> 02:51:49.140
recreate his father technologically from
 

02:51:49.140 --> 02:51:52.050
recreate his father technologically from
these men from all sorts of different

02:51:52.050 --> 02:51:52.060
these men from all sorts of different

these men from all sorts of different
things from memory from all the the data

02:51:54.300 --> 02:51:54.310
things from memory from all the the data
 

02:51:54.310 --> 02:51:57.330
things from memory from all the the data
the noodles from recorded stuff it one

02:51:57.330 --> 02:51:57.340
the noodles from recorded stuff it one
 

02:51:57.340 --> 02:51:59.490
the noodles from recorded stuff it one
of the most fascinating concepts that

02:51:59.490 --> 02:51:59.500
of the most fascinating concepts that
 

02:51:59.500 --> 02:52:03.530
of the most fascinating concepts that
I've ever heard when it comes to the

02:52:03.530 --> 02:52:03.540
I've ever heard when it comes to the
 

02:52:03.540 --> 02:52:07.170
I've ever heard when it comes to the
increased increasing power of computing

02:52:07.170 --> 02:52:07.180
increased increasing power of computing
 

02:52:07.180 --> 02:52:09.630
increased increasing power of computing
is that they're going to get to a point

02:52:09.630 --> 02:52:09.640
is that they're going to get to a point
 

02:52:09.640 --> 02:52:12.090
is that they're going to get to a point
one day if computers continue

02:52:12.090 --> 02:52:12.100
one day if computers continue
 

02:52:12.100 --> 02:52:13.620
one day if computers continue
accelerating they're going to get to a

02:52:13.620 --> 02:52:13.630
accelerating they're going to get to a
 

02:52:13.630 --> 02:52:15.719
accelerating they're going to get to a
point one day where they can take into

02:52:15.719 --> 02:52:15.729
point one day where they can take into
 

02:52:15.729 --> 02:52:17.880
point one day where they can take into
account all the positions of all the

02:52:17.880 --> 02:52:17.890
account all the positions of all the
 

02:52:17.890 --> 02:52:19.500
account all the positions of all the
objects and all the things that are

02:52:19.500 --> 02:52:19.510
objects and all the things that are
 

02:52:19.510 --> 02:52:21.990
objects and all the things that are
exist all over the world as data and

02:52:21.990 --> 02:52:22.000
exist all over the world as data and
 

02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:25.740
exist all over the world as data and
from them extrapolate where things will

02:52:25.740 --> 02:52:25.750
from them extrapolate where things will
 

02:52:25.750 --> 02:52:29.099
from them extrapolate where things will
be and where things were so by where

02:52:29.099 --> 02:52:29.109
be and where things were so by where
 

02:52:29.109 --> 02:52:31.019
be and where things were so by where
things were meaning knowing everything

in this room where it's at in this
 

02:52:32.859 --> 02:52:34.889
in this room where it's at in this
position they'll be able to figure out

this over there and Brian picked that up

02:52:40.139 --> 02:52:40.149
this over there and Brian picked that up
 

02:52:40.149 --> 02:52:41.910
this over there and Brian picked that up
and turned it on and they'll they'll

02:52:41.910 --> 02:52:41.920
and turned it on and they'll they'll
 

02:52:41.920 --> 02:52:45.150
and turned it on and they'll they'll
literally be able to calculate the past

02:52:45.150 --> 02:52:45.160
literally be able to calculate the past
 

02:52:45.160 --> 02:52:48.300
literally be able to calculate the past
they'll be able to buy what we have here

02:52:48.300 --> 02:52:48.310
they'll be able to buy what we have here
 

02:52:48.310 --> 02:52:49.679
they'll be able to buy what we have here
buy everything we have here and what we

buy everything we have here and what we
 

02:52:49.689 --> 02:52:52.200
buy everything we have here and what we
know they'll be able to calculate the

02:52:52.200 --> 02:52:52.210
know they'll be able to calculate the
 

02:52:52.210 --> 02:52:56.969

time that's what yeah he's holding up
okay well at this point I'm just like

02:53:02.490 --> 02:53:02.500
okay well at this point I'm just like
 

02:53:02.500 --> 02:53:04.830
okay well at this point I'm just like
okay that's madness it is I don't

02:53:04.830 --> 02:53:04.840
okay that's madness it is I don't
 

02:53:04.840 --> 02:53:06.269
okay that's madness it is I don't
