00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.420
You're entering a world of awkwardness. A world of overused characters and clichés.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.600
A world where hammy acting is rewarded, and terrible effects are the norm.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.900
A world where plot devices are either over-explained, or not explained enough.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.280
Behind that door is a river of blood. Behind that door, two scary little girls.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.820
Behind that door, a shitty remake that fucks it all up.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.100
You're about to enter...The Stephen King Mini-series.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.860
Woah!

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.560
Okay, before you guys go nuts, I want to emphasize: I don't hate Stephen King.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.400
He's a very talented writer, and has written some very good stories.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.160
But that doesn't mean I have to like everything he's done,

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.020
and on top of that, that doesn't mean the movies and mini-series based on his books are that great either.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.780
Case in point: The Langoliers!

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.180
This is one of those drawn-out mini-series from the mid-90's.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.220
Everybody was hooked, despite its incredibly goofy moments,

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.540
but were then suddenly let down by one of the silliest payoffs ever.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.220
It's long, it's silly, it's over the top, it's a Stephen King mini-series! Let's take a look!

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.860
So we see a bunch of people arriving at an airport in L.A.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.300
One of them is a little blind girl named Dina, one is a woman named Laurel,

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.060
and one is a British assassin, hired to kill somebody.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.620
By who, you may ask? Well, by the director himself, Tom Holland.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.300
"See ya in London on Saturday. We'll have a pint to celebrate!"

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.960
Now you might be wondering why I know who Tom Holland is.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.980
Well I did a little research, and found out that he directed such movies as Child's Play and Fright Night.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.080
Why does this matter? It doesn't! It doesn't matter at all! They were silly movies then, and they're silly movies now.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.580
What's that? Why am I bringing it up then?

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.080
Well, I guess I'm wondering why his name takes up two thirds of the credits!

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.560
I mean, holy shit! His name is huge!

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.580
Ya got all these other people, I don't know, who cares,

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.000
TOM HOLLAND!

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.860
Outlined in shiny metallic lettering! It's bigger than Stephen King's name!

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.820
Well, I guess if this is the same guy who brought us this:

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.680
"Dinner's in the oven!"

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.300
"Mmmmm-mh!"

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.100
We're in good hands.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.080
By the way, while watching this opening, tell me you don't want to hear this music:

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.240
"The white zone is for immediate loading and unloading of passengers only."

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.700
"There is no stopping in the red zone."

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.480
There's also a pilot played by David Morris who's travelling to Boston as a passenger.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.480
So, everybody boards the shamefully fake CGI plane, and wakes up to a shocking surprise.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.060
Most of the people on the plane have just vanished.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.800
"Would somebody speak to me, please? I'm sorry, but my aunt's gone, and I'm blind."

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.120
*screaming*

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.700
"It's alright, It's alright. What's wrong?"

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.380
"Where is everybody? They've gone, they've all gone!"

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.380
"Whaddya mean where is everybody, they're all right here."

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.560
Wait a minute, you just walked by ten rows, and you didn't notice any of them didn't have people in it?

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.780
I know you're a pilot, but surely you know planes are more full than this!

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.020
"Where is everybody? What's going on?"

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.340
"Aunt Vicky! Aunt Vicky!"

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.400
"What the hell is going on here? Will someone shut this brat up?"

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.760
Oh my god. Is that-

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.900
It is! It's Balki from Perfect Strangers!

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.540
Oh, oh Jesus, please tell me he gives an over-the-top performance!

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.240
"I have a meeting at Boston's prudential center at nine o'clock this morning!"

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.340
"Promptly at nine o'clock!"

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.000
"That's what's important!"

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.520
Oh Lord, we thank you for this performance and the actor you have chosen to give it.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.540
Truly, he will supply great laughter for this review!

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.880
Thank you, lord.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.140
So it turns out, only a handful left of people are left on the plane.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.860
All that's left of the other passengers are material items like watches and earphones,

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.380
Even the pilots have disappeared.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.500
But does Balki care about this? Of course not, don't be ridiculous!

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.280
"Now I have three questions for you. Number one, who authorized an unscheduled stop-"

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.080
"Number two, where was that stop made? And number three, WHY?"

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.580
"You ever watch Mr. Spock on Star Trek? Cause if you don't shut your cakehole, you bloody idiot,"

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.160
"I'd be happy to demonstrate his Vulcan sleeper hold for you."

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.480
Did he just make Star Trek sound badass?

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.040
So he puts him in a 'nose' hold. Don't believe me? Listen.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.400
"Woah, a nose hold!"

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.680
See? And that seems to shut him up for a while.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.000
Meanwhile, the pilot goes into the cockpit to see if he can radio for help.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.040
"Airforce Control, this is American Pride, flight 29. Do you read me, over?"

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.340
"What?"

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.660
But it turns out, nobody's responding on the ground, and the pilot's too afraid to land in one of the busiest airports in the world.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.700
So where are they gonna go?

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.700
"No, we're heading to Bangor, Maine."

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.340
MAINE! I know we're not playing the Stephen King Drinking Game™, but I don't care, I gotta take a drink to that!

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.080
Ohh!

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.800
What is your fetish with that place?

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.520
And of course, Balki doesn't like this at all.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.560
"Bangor International Airport'll be our safest bet."

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.360
"I have an important business meeting in Boston this morning at nine o'clock!"

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.640
My wide angle lens is about to burst!

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.620
"-AND I FORBID YOU..."

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.300
"Would you please be quiet? You're scaring the little girl."

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.980
"Scaring the little girl??"

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.800
*scoffing*
"SCARING THE LITTLE GIRL? LADY!"

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.020
Did he just get castrated on that line?

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.540
"Scaring the little girl??"

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.440
Scaring the little GIRL!

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:26.640
"Lady!"

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.280
Speaking of which, the little girl suddenly sees what Balki is seeing,

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.340
And discovers that most of his vision is distorted by scary imagery.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.280
"...like a lot it's serious"

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.280
*screaming*

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.480
Of course, everybody wonders what the hell that was about, and the little girl explains.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.400
"We all look like monsters to him."

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.560
"No. I'm sure we don't. Now what made you say that?"

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.860
"I hear things sometimes. People's thoughts.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.060
"She called it 'Shining.'"

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.300
So yes. It turns out the little girl is psychic.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:14.240
Might as well add her to the Unexplained Psychic Children's Club that seems to exist in T.V. and movies.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.460
"That's the craziest thing I ever heard."

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:21.120
We also come across a mystery writer who's trying to deduce what is happening on this plane.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.680
And oddly enough, he is exactly like a character out of a bad mystery novel.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.160
"I also"

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.700
"had been asleep"

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.520
"What about you, dear boy?"

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.460
"Well, yeah." 
"Yes."

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.020
"I'm a mystery writer, deduction is my bread and butter."

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.440
"So I deduce,"

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:45.520
"That everyone was asleep including all those people that were subtracted, along with the flight crew, of course, dear boy."

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:46.520
Perhaps,

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.300
dear boy,

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:47.800
If I

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:48.320
deduce

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.220
a little bit more,

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:49.860
my acting

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:50.360
will become

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.200
a little bit more

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:51.840
Shatner.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.180
Does anybody notice

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:53.680
the

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.580
teddy bear out on the

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:55.140
plane?

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.480
He looks suspiciously like the

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:56.980
teddy bear

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:57.480
from the

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:57.980
Shining.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:58.960
The one that was giving a

00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:59.460
blowjob

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:00.000
for some reason.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:00.780
another

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:01.280
Stephen

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:01.780
King story.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:02.480
Coincidence?

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.060
Or something more?

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.360
I

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.140
Deduce, dear boy.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:14.340
So they finally reach Maine, and for some reason, nobody wants to see what's actually down there.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.740
"I really don't want to go down there."

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:17.800
"I'm scared stiff."

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:18.840
"God help us all."

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:20.380
"Maybe this wasn't such a good idea"

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:21.260
"I'm scared."

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:25.320
The hell's wrong with these people? You're on a plane where everybody disappeared!

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.860
How the hell are you gonna be safe there?

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:31.280
Oh no, there might be people down there to question us and want to solve our problem!

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.740
OH the horror!

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:38.700
Also, don't you just love how the adult is whining to the kid, and the kid has to make her feel better?

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.200
"You know something, Dinah?"
"What?"

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.800
"I really don't want to go down there. I mean, I really don't."

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.600
"If it'll make you feel any better, you're not the only one."

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.080
*crying*
Don't worry, fully grown, mature woman.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:56.700
I, a terrified little blind girl will keep you comfort.

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.540
*crying* Oh, thank you! *crying*

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.480
Hey now! Looks like somebody's getting a smooth landing over here!

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.520
Set your johnson to its full upright position.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.200
Oh yeah.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:18.000
*screaming*

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:21.960
"Please, I just don't want to die, I just don't want to die!"

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:26.800
And I don't want to say that line anymore, so we're just gonna go with that take!

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.920
But of course, they land just fine. 
And as is typical of Maine,

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:35.720
It's weird, creepy, and totally filled with things that Stephen King is afraid of.

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:37.920
"This place smells wrong."

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.440
"Really, badly wrong."

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.480
"Honey, we have to investigate. We don't have any choice."

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.660
"Why? Why do we have to?"

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.440
You know, she's right. We should go back on the plane and wait to die. DUH!

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:55.760
"Listen. There's nothing to smell, and nothing to hear.

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.300
Well, this is getting dull. Where's another wide-angle shot of Balki?

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.360
*Ding!*
There we go!

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.780
"You realize I can turn you in for this."

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.880
"Mr. Toomey, are you aware of what has happened to us?"

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.900
"There are no excuses!"

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:08.060
"Mr. Toomey?"

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.360
"Just terrible."

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:13.140
Oh hey! An obnoxious flashback, and a crazy parent!

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:15.300
That's two Stephen King clichés in one!

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.840
I don't want the hangover.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:25.040
Apparently Balki has a flashback to when his father was angry because he got an "A-" in class.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.140
An "A-?" I got a trip to Chuck-E-Cheese when that happened!

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:33.000
"What happens to lazy bums who lie down on the job, Craig?"

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.380
"The langoliers get them?"

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.200
"THEY WILL EAT YOU ALIVE!"

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.440
"ALIVE AND SCREAMING!"

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.100
Well, at least now we know where he gets his hammy acting from.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:46.440
"Do you understand that the economic fate of nations may hinge on this meeting-"

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.600
"Right now I don't have the time to-"

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.260
"Time?"

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.460
"WHAT THE HELL DO YOU KNOW ABOUT TIME?"

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.100
"ASK ME ABOUT TIME! ASK ME!"

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:59.020
Okay. I give him two more seconds before he fully transforms into a cartoon character.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.260
We all know it's coming, you can't hold it back.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.000
"ASK ME ABOUT TIME! ASK ME!"

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:04.600
*explosion*

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.820
*Woody the Woodpecker laughter*

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.320
So again, they calm him down, and they go through the luggage conveyor belt.

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.140
Why don't they just go through a door?

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.560
They go inside and find that the place is abandoned.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.040
Plus little things, like smells and sounds have all been slightly muted.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.900
And it seems like the clocks have stopped, too.

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:27.300
Spock...

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.320
While that's going on, Balki starts to hallucinate about his father.

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:33.960
"You had an appointment in Boston."

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.380
"No, it wasn't my fault! I- I was kidnapped!"

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:39.300
"THERE ARE NO EXCUSES!"

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.760
And they play the most common game in a Stephen King miniseries:

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.300
Who can overact with their mouth open the widest?

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:50.180
"Well I am going to explode, father, and I don't give a damn!"

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:51.660
"You know what I DID?"

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.580
Oh, not bad, seven centimeters!

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.360
Balki's dad's gonna have to REALLY over-act in order to beat that size!

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:02.200
"LOVE IS NOT PART OF THE BIG PICTURE!"

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:06.080
WOW! An astonishing twelve centimeters!

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.400
You could drive the Oscar Mayer Truck through that hole!

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:12.400
Congratulations, sir, you're the biggest over-actor in this movie!

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.520
I say that calls for the Dance of Joy!

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:21.040
"Dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah"
"Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!"

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:24.200
*laughter and applause*

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:27.680
So as he goes through an airport security door (which of course isn't locked),

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.540
Dinah swears she hears a creepy sound in the distance.

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:35.480
So creepy that it forces her to take off her glasses even though it has no impact on her vision.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.580
"Dinah? Tell us what you hear."

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.060
"It's very faint. A really terrible, scary sound."

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:43.720
"And it's awful."

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.900
"A little like Rice Crispies after you pour in the milk."

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:51.320
I'm sorry, what was that incredibly scary comparison again?

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.200
"A little like Rice Crispies after you pour in the milk."

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:59.240
Alright. Put a search out for these guys. But be cautious!

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.880
They are part of a complete breakfast.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:04.540
"But I know it's closer than it was, because something's coming."

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.680
"There's something making that horrible cereal noise!"

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:12.020
Did this movie really just coin the phrase, "horrible cereal noise?"

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:14.420
This is a phrase that needs to exist?

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:17.520
"It's coming! Don't you understand? It's coming!"

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:21.820
"And if we haven't gone by the time it gets here, we're all going to die!"

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:26.080
We're all going to die a snappy, crackling, poppy death!

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.460
*Snap, Crackle, Pop, Rice Crispies!*

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:37.660
So we see Balki comes across another unlocked door where he finds a gun in one of the storage lockers.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:42.380
Huh. If there's anything this movie is proving, it's that airport security doesn't come down hard enough!

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:49.020
*James Bond music*

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:54.980
"You're out there, aren't you? But I'll be gone by the time you get here."

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.680
"I'm going to Boston."

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.380
*Woody the Woodpecker laughter*

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.140
"As you say, there's none of that stuff here."

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:06.320
"But when we woke up, it was on the plane."

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.820
Wha- Does nobody see him right now?

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:10.680
"Maybe nobody was here when it happened."

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:12.020
"No, that's nonsense."

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:14.700
Seriously, nobody sees him right now- you're looking right at him!

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.160
"Watch out, I hear someone!"

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:20.180
I hear him much better than you idiots can see him right in front of your fucking faces!

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.200
"Take me to Boston!"

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:26.720
So Billy from Power Rangers attacks, and gets shot. But luckily, bullets seem to have no effect in this world.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:30.220
So they get some rope and tie up the doofus before he acts any crazier.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.060
"I think it might be wise to take a few precautions, don't you?"

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:33.860
*whimpering*

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:35.900
"Do you have to be so rough?"

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:38.900
I mean all he tried to do was kill somebody. That doesn't call for being rough!

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:43.740
So this is all very riveting, but I think it's time for another Shatner performance.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:45.680
"I think I've found"

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.520
"A fallacy in our thinking"

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:50.480
"And it is this:"

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:57.520
"We all assumed as we began to grasp the dimensions of this event

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:02.280
God, I swear his pauses were written into the screenplay. I swear to god.

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:06.000
I mean, let's count 'em! Let's count how many pauses are in this few seconds.

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:07.920
"I think I found"

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:08.420
*ding!*

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:10.620
"A fallacy in our thinking"

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:11.360
*ding!*

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.780
"And it is this:"

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:13.300
*ding!*

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:17.540
"We all assumed as we began to grasp-"

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:18.040
*ding!*

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.980
"the dimensions of this event"

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:20.480
*ding!*

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:24.320
"That something had happened to the rest of the world"

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:24.820
*ding!*

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.540
"But the evidence doesn't bear that assumption out."

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:28.420
*ding!*

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.020
"What has happened"

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:30.520
*ding!*

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:31.740
"has happened"

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:32.240
*ding!*

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.400
"to us!"

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:38.880
Nine pauses. That's nine pauses! Can somebody just tell this idiot to get to the point?

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.140
"Please, Mr. Jenkins, can we get to the point?"

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:50.720
"Every now and then, a hole appears in the stream of time. Not a time warp, but a- a- ri- a time rip."

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:54.360
So he suggests that it might be a time rip that the plane flew into.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.400
But that it doesn't work like how most time travel movies say it works.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:06.540
"But one can't appear in the Texas State School Book Depository on November 22nd 1963 and hope to stop the Kennedy assassination."

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:08.720
No, that would be a friggin' awesome storyline.

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:10.080
"This"

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:12.300
"Is the past."

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:16.060
So if you could actually follow any of that, they have to find some fuel and escape fast,

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.940
or else they'll vanish with the rest of time.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:23.260
Dinah, for whatever reason, decides she wants to find out more about these langoliers that Balki was talking about.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.320
"Tell me more about them."

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:31.840
"My father used to say that the langoliers were little creatures that lived in closets-"

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:32.680
"Like elves."

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.380
"No, hahahahaha!"

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:36.840
"Don't be ridiculous!"

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:44.520
"He said that all they really were was hair, and teeth, and fast little legs."

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:45.400
Robin Williams?

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:50.800
"So that they could catch up with all the bad little boys, no matter how quickly they scampered."

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.420
"Stop it. You're scaring her."

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:55.400
Yeah. You're scaring the little girl!

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.420
"SCARING THE LITTLE GIRL?"

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:02.240
So everybody realizes that they can't burn the fuel for the plane, because fire doesn't work in this world.

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:07.000
But Generic McDork here believes that he might have the "solution to our PROBLEM!"

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.960
"I have the solution to our PROBLEM!"

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:13.480
They get to the plane and bring the food and beer that used to have no flavor.

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.420
But it turns out in the plane, it does!

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:19.220
Which means time works okay inside, therefore, the fuel will work as well.

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:22.900
However, while everybody's looking at that, Balki escapes and gets himself a knife.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.940
But it's okay, the little girl is there to try and comfort him.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.300
"He's scared to death, I feel so sorry for him."

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.440
"Mr. Toomey, please come out!"

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:35.020
"YEEEEAAAAAAH!"
*screaming*

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.840
Well, you know that's really scaring the little girl.

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.700
"SCARING THE LITTLE GIRL?"

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:44.620
"Don't you worry, love. We're gonna have you right as rain in no time flat."

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:50.820
"Listen to me. She's got internal bleeding. We don't get this blade out of her right now, damn quick,"

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.860
"She's gonna drown in her own blood."

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:54.600
Right as rain, darling, right as rain.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.860
She is going to drown in her own blood.

00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:58.580
Right as rain, darling, right as rain!

00:16:58.580 --> 00:16:59.740
Drown!

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:02.840
So dorky and the black guy go looking for a stretcher.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.380
But Balki is there waiting for them.

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:08.560
It's okay, he's a black guy in a Stephen King film. They always turn out fine, right?

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:09.700
"He's in here! He's in here!"

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:12.220
*yelling*

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:13.340
*slide whistle*

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:15.940
"You're one of them too, aren't ya?"

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.060
"A langolier?"

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:20.520
You know, it figures. This guy has survived three Silence of the Lambs movies,

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.460
and yet it's a Stephen King flick that finally kills him off.

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:26.820
"I'm telling you man, the black guy always dies first."

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:27.900
"Damn!"

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:33.200
But the dork knocks him out with a toaster in the bag, and the brit decides whether or not he should kill him.

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:37.140
But then he remembers how the blind girl told him to leave him alive, so that's exactly what he does.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:42.320
He doesn't tie up his hands or anything, he just sorta lets the psychotic killer sit there until he wakes up.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.960
What secret idiot service did this guy work for again?

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:52.580
But, get this. The girl, even though she's been stabbed, uses her psychic powers to make Balki believe she's really there.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.400
"Hurry, Craig."

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.260
"Now stand, Craig. Stand."

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:08.760
*Perfect Strangers theme music*

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:13.520
Just as they get fuel to the plane, and everyone gets on board, the girl creates a false image,

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:18.500
again, with her psychic powers, and makes Balki believe that he's at the meeting he was trying to reach.

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:22.120
You know, if she's so good at this shit, how come she didn't predict when she was gonna get stabbed?

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.320
"IT'S MISTER TOOMEY!"

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.540
Hey naninaninani hey! Naninaninani-

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:33.140
"Never mind him right now, we're all out of time.

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:40.060
So he makes it to the meeting, and finds that Stephen King is there, to give his blessing to this shitstorm of a miniseries.

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:42.600
"Tell us how much money you made for us!"

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:50.180
"I didn't make any money for you, I didn't make any money for you! I lost money for you!

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:55.980
"And I did it deliberately! I DID IT DELIBERATELY! I DID IT DELIBERATELY!"

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.220
*laughter*

00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:02.220
Actually, I think this is how the meeting went with Tom Holland and Stephen King after this movie was released.

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.080
*booming*

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:09.920
But that crackling noise is getting louder, and we finally find out what's been getting closer and closer all this time...

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:15.200
Let's get ready for a letdown!

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:19.080
*'Get Ready For This' playing*

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:27.360
Yup! This is what we've been building to all this time, people, some of the worst CGI you'll ever see in your entire life.

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:31.160
*Screaming*

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.020
What are you screaming at? They're just overcooked meatballs!

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:43.720
Oh God, these are making the spider from 'It' look real. That's how bad it is, people!

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:51.700
Come on, just add in the other Pac-Man characters, and the goofiness will be complete.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.140
*Woody Woodpecker laugh*

00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:58.500
*screaming*

00:19:58.500 --> 00:19:59.840
"I'll be good again-"

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:04.580
*screaming*

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.980
By the way, there's a black guy inside in case you want to eat him too.

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:17.260
So, as the watch the film literally crumble before their eyes,

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:21.140
The mystery writer decides he needs one more monologue to sum up the scene.

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:24.640
"We know what happens to today when it becomes yesterday."

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:26.860
"It waits for them."

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:28.960
"The timekeepers of eternity"

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:31.200
"Always following behind"

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.640
"Cleaning up the mess in the most efficient way possible."

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:37.920
"By eating it."

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:42.280
Well, yeah, I guess you can't argue there, it really is the most efficient way possible.

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:47.200
Sending giant elephant turds with chainsaw teeth to eat up every half-second of time.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:51.100
Boy, God must have been really fucking baked when he came up with that idea!

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:52.200
*godly music*

00:20:52.200 --> 00:21:01.420
And thus, when all time passes, you will see...giant ape testicles that eat up the world like a tuna sandwich!

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:03.340
Sorry, could you repeat that?

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:04.700
WRITE IT DOWN!

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:12.880
So, as time is- *sigh* eaten up by killer skee-balls, the plane tries to retrace its tracks and make it back to the time rip.

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:19.380
"What does a most secret classification mean when you just seen a bunch of killer cannonballs rolling up the world?

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:22.640
Well gee, when you put it like that, it sounds incredibly fucking stupid.

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:29.100
We see that Dinah finally dies on the plane, I guess a stab in the lungs takes longer than a stab in the back to take effect.

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:31.380
And they finally reach what they've been looking for.

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:38.440
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have found what we are looking for."

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.400
It appears to be a...

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:42.240
sky-gina.

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:49.640
Okay, here's my question: were the pilots who were originally flying this plane taking a look at that thing and saying,

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:51.580
"Yeah! We wanna go through that!"

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.220
Seriously, why would they aim for this thing?

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:56.620
Wouldn't they consider the safety of the passengers  first?

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:58.100
Hey Frank, look at that!

00:21:58.560 --> 00:21:59.580
Is that a sky-gina?

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:01.240
Yeah, that's a sky-gina, isn't that awesome?

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:01.900
It's totally awesome!

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:03.280
It's so awesome! You dare me to go through it?

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.340
Yeah, I'll dare you to go through it!

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:06.120
You dare me to go through it? I'll go through it!
I'll totally dare you to go through it! Go though it, man!

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:10.540
Okay! I'm going though it! I'm going through it! Haha this is the best idea ever! Aaah-

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.560
But the mystery writer points out that they were all asleep when they went through it the first time,

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:18.020
and so they all have to be asleep to get through it again.

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:22.040
So they decide to put the pressure up to knock everybody out, but there's still another problem.

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:27.080
"One of us will have to stay awake to turn the pressure up just before we fly through the rip."

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:29.020
"So... one of us will-"

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:30.440
"One of us will have to die."

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.440
Not it.
Not it.
Not it.

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.720
Actually, the British guy decides to sacrifice his life,

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:39.820
I guess he's knocked off so many other people, it only seems fair.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.100
So everybody gets knocked out, and he flies the plane through the rip.

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:53.000
"I just want to tell you boys, good luck. We're all counting on you."

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:57.700
"It's so beautiful."

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.080
And of course, he ultimately disappears.

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:05.880
Why the hell his clothes, shoes, and belt don't stay behind is anybody's guess, but who cares! They made it home!

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:07.620
But! Is it really home?

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:10.380
"But what do you see out the window?"

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:14.360
"Nothing. Nothing at all."

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:19.040
Oh except for the obvious MOVING CARS DOWN THERE. Oops.

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:21.640
They land the plane, and everything seems deserted.

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.260
But that's because they realize that time is catching up with them.

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:27.480
*background chatter*

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:30.680
"Daddy! New people, look at the new people!"

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.960
"Did you hear what she said?"

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:33.460
"Yes!"

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:37.160
"Is that who we are? The new people?"

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:37.820
*laughter*

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:39.520
"Are we the new people?"

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:46.500
Are we the new people? Are we the new people? We are! We are the new people!

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:52.140
And the only way new people can celebrate is by doing a stereotypical freeze frame!

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:53.240
"Yeah!"

00:23:54.120 --> 00:24:00.160
*Perfect Strangers theme music*

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.820
Ohohoho!

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:02.980
God this was stupid.

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:09.440
I mean, to its credit, it does keep you interested in it enough to want to know what's going on, as most Stephen King stories do.

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:16.200
Some of the actors are pretty good too, but there's just so many goofy performances, non-sensical logic, bad effects,

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:21.180
and just the STUPIDEST letdown climax, that it's hard to fully take it seriously.

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:26.420
I mean, are you really telling me that giant mutant mudballs are eating all of the past?

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:27.440
*electric sound*

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.180
*Back to the Future theme music*

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:29.620
Let's find out!

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:30.440
What are you doing here?

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:35.100
I'm sending you 45 minutes in the past to see if your theory's correct!

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:35.600
*mumble*

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.320
Oh, do we have to?

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.300
Yes! Hurry!

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.080
Alright, keep your beard on.

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.540
Hey, this is your beard too!

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:49.740
Everything seems to be okay.

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:51.440
Hmm. Yes, I-

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:54.460
*eating sounds*

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:56.160
Uh... shit.

00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:59.620
Um, yeah, I thought we were supposed to eat 2:30.

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:02.360
We were supposed to eat 2:30. Well, maybe it was supposed to be 2:35.

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:05.380
No, I'm pretty sure it was 2:30... cause, uh, umm...
—...supposed to be 2:30.

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:10.740
Never mind us, we're uh, just giant floating malted milk balls here, we're uh-

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:11.620
Oooooooh...

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:16.180
Nothing out of the ordinary. At all. Everyday occurence, yeah, hahaha.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.960
Oh man, the skygina's gonna be pissed.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:19.580
I'm blaming you.

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:23.040
*Perfect Strangers theme music*

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:47.960
"SCARING THE LITTLE GIRL? LADY!"

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:59.200
