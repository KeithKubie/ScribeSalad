00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.190
I'm here with Jason Barros
who's the program manager for

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.840
the Georgia Tech team here at Udacity.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.780
He also formerly worked at
the education startup, EdMoto.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:07.900
Thank you so much for
talking to us today.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.370
&gt;&gt; Yeah absolutely David.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.040
&gt;&gt; So the first thing I'd ask is that
many of our students in this class might

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.305
be interested in spinning up their
projects to a startup after this

00:00:15.305 --> 00:00:16.225
class is done.

00:00:16.225 --> 00:00:17.545
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; What are some obstacles or

00:00:17.545 --> 00:00:20.145
some things to keep in
mind when dealing with

00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:22.635
the business side of
educational technology?

00:00:22.635 --> 00:00:26.695
&gt;&gt; I mean, one, you really want to
go in and exhibit a lot of patience.

00:00:26.695 --> 00:00:30.375
It is really slow working
with universities and

00:00:30.375 --> 00:00:33.155
any educational institutions.

00:00:33.155 --> 00:00:36.555
There are a lot of things that they
need to consider that you may not

00:00:36.555 --> 00:00:37.950
necessarily be considering.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.920
At the time you're
beginning your start up.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.910
They have federal laws, state laws,
and you have to look out for

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.030
student's rights and privacy.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.370
All that comes into play
anytime you want to work or

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.670
do anything on
an educational institution.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.060
&gt;&gt; So what about ed tech when
it's not necessarily dealing with

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.700
academia though.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.060
For example,
here at Udacity we do education but

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.530
we don't do it partnering with
a University except for Georgia Tech.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.620
We do other programs.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.730
So are there any specific considerations
when doing it outside of that overlap?

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.620
&gt;&gt; I mean one,
you really want to focus on,

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.940
what it is that you're trying to get
across or teach to the students.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.560
While we're at Moto, you know our
primary concern was communication,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.970
we wanted to make sure that
the communication flowed

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.450
between the teacher and the students,
and amongst the students themselves.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.540
Here at Udacity, we're focused
a little bit more on the pedagogy of

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.530
actually teaching a particular subject.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.150
So, we want to make sure that
what we're teaching, and

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.320
how we're teaching it
is particularly sound.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.440
&gt;&gt; Some of those students who might be
interested in spinning their project up

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.570
into some kind of business or start up.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.080
What would you say the first step is?

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.100
What do they need to do in the two or

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.300
three weeks after this semester
is over to move that along?

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.900
&gt;&gt; I mean, really start small and
be patient.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.320
Share with your classmates and other
people at the educational institution

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.090
Institutions or just friends,
and present the idea to them.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.730
And try to get a little feedback of
what they think is going to be viable.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.125
And then, putting together a minimum
viable product is really important.

00:02:01.125 --> 00:02:03.905
You don't want to go too far and

00:02:03.905 --> 00:02:07.125
try to build something that's going
to get a lot of users right away.

00:02:07.125 --> 00:02:08.354
It's going to take time.

00:02:09.365 --> 00:02:12.755
At Moto, we were a grassroots
organization where teachers talked to

00:02:12.755 --> 00:02:17.035
teachers about our product but it took
time to build up the number of users and

00:02:17.035 --> 00:02:22.135
after a while, the network worked such
that we were able to get millions and

00:02:22.135 --> 00:02:25.380
millions of students and
teachers on the platform.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.390
But it took a long time and
a lot of patience.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.750
&gt;&gt; Yeah, makes sense.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.250
Also for the students who might want to
go into the business side of educational

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.480
technology, do you have any final
suggestions for them before we sign out?

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.760
&gt;&gt; Again, patience.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.178
If you're going to work with any
kind of educational institution,

00:02:42.178 --> 00:02:43.890
they have their process.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.837
And what I discovered here at Udacity,
working with Georgia Tech,

00:02:47.837 --> 00:02:51.180
is the business world moves
at the speed of light.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.770
And unfortunately, the academic
world doesn't, and for good cause,

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.430
they need to be careful.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.442
And they're trying to
protect their students,

00:02:59.442 --> 00:03:02.460
they're trying to protect
their institution.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.192
They have state laws,
federal laws and all that stuff and

00:03:06.192 --> 00:03:09.160
working through that stuff,
it takes time.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.670
And the more you can communicate and
be open with what you intend to do and

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.760
share with as many people as possible,
the better luck you're going to have.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.290
&gt;&gt; I can say I participated kind of
peripherally in the NSF I-Corps process.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.860
It looks to develop academic
research up into businesses.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.060
And that's one of
the things they really,

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.230
really emphasize as well,
is customer discovery.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.470
Go out and talk to your customers.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.550
That one of the number one things that

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.200
trips up early start ups is they
assume they know their customer.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.330
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; And they assume they know exactly

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.980
what they want.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.780
They never talk to them
because we know what you want.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.570
And they just assign their tool for
them.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:43.330
And then hit market and

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.760
then find out they designed
something that no one wants.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.650
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.
&gt;&gt; So really,

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.650
talking to the people who might want
to use the tool throughout would be,

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.570
I think, I agree, the first step to do.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.015
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and getting
the perspective is really important.

00:03:55.015 --> 00:03:57.705
We come in and
we want to disrupt everything.

00:03:57.705 --> 00:03:59.355
We want to disrupt education.

00:03:59.355 --> 00:04:01.745
We think we have a really
good idea in doing so and

00:04:01.745 --> 00:04:03.425
we have the best intentions.

00:04:03.425 --> 00:04:07.165
But oftentimes their perspective,
while sometimes even archaic,

00:04:07.165 --> 00:04:09.297
is still pretty valuable.

00:04:09.297 --> 00:04:11.935
You want to make sure you take that into
account because these are the people you

00:04:11.935 --> 00:04:12.905
are going to be working with.

00:04:12.905 --> 00:04:16.690
Yes we all want to serve the students
and make the world a better place.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.450
But we need to do it
in a measured fashion.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.649
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
Sounds good.

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:22.430
All right, well thank you so
much for talking to us.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.260
&gt;&gt; Yeah, any time, David.
