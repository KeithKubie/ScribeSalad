00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm in Syracuse with my assistant Roberta and apparently most of Syracuse as well.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We were going to do the experiment we've been learning about--Eratosthenes' experiment

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
where he determines the circumference of the earth measuring shadows.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
All you're going to need to do to perform this experiment is get some help.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Thank you Roberta. &gt;&gt;You're welcome.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
You're going need a string or some sort of straight stick, a weight on the end of that string

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
to make sure that it's truly vertical and some sort of measuring device.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Now my measuring device is a ruler and it's marked in inches.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
You might have one marked in centimeters, but like we mentioned before

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
the only thing relevant in this experiment is the ratio and the units don't matter.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It's really not important. Now let's go ahead and make our first measurement.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Can you just put it this way--perfect--and down so your thumb touches it--perfect, perfect.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And the length here is 42 inches. Now without changing anything, without moving anything.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Rebecca is holding perfectly still. Gracia!

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I'm going to make the next measurement which is that of the shadow

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and I get a result of 8-1/2 inches.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Now you'll notice over here, it's not really clear where the shadow begins and ends.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
This is uncertainty in my measurement and that's something we're going to have to deal with.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
When you do the experiment at home, you'll have uncertainty as well.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
In fact, uncertainty is inherit to any measurement you make in physics.

00:01:37.000 --> 99:59:59.000
We'll talk about that later but thank you very much Rebecca. &gt;&gt;You're welcome.
