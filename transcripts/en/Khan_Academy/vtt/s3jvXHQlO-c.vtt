00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.540
- [Voiceover] "Find the
coordinates of all points

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.370
"on the curve at which the line tangent

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.400
"to the curve at that point is vertical."

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.020
So we wanna figure out
the points on that curve

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.962
where the tangent line is vertical.

00:00:13.962 --> 00:00:16.930
So let's just remind
ourselves what the slope

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.320
of a tangent line is, or what it isn't.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.360
I guess this may be a better
way to think about it.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.260
If you have a horizontal line,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.340
so let me draw a horizontal line.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.014
If you have a horizontal line like that,

00:00:28.014 --> 00:00:29.610
well then your slope is zero.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.850
Or you can say your rate of change of y

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.106
with respect to x is equal to zero.

00:00:35.106 --> 00:00:36.580
What about a vertical line?

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.383
If you have a vertical line like that,

00:00:39.383 --> 00:00:44.162
what is your rate of change
of y with respect to x?

00:00:44.162 --> 00:00:46.880
Well, some people might say it's infinity,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.091
or you could say it's undefined.

00:00:49.091 --> 00:00:52.130
It's undefined in some way

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.560
because at some point your rate,

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.130
or one way to think about it,
you're gonna try to divide

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.680
by zero because you
have a huge change in y

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.950
over no change in x.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.500
Or another way to think about it

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.980
that's a little bit more in line with that

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.370
is you could say that your
change in x with respect

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.000
to change in y, notice I
took took the reciprocal,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.960
so now we're talking about
a change at the derivative

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.670
of x with respect to y is equal to zero

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.540
because your y can change,
but as your y changes,

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.629
your x does not change.

00:01:21.629 --> 00:01:26.340
So can we use this little
insight here on vertical lines

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.280
to think about the coordinates
of all points in the curve

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.920
at which the line tangent to the curve

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.856
at that point is vertical.

00:01:32.856 --> 00:01:35.190
Well before, they told us,

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.200
they gave us the curve of the equation,

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.780
and they also told us what dy, dx is.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.200
Let me just rewrite 'em again
just so we have 'em there.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.520
So we know that y to the third

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.460
minus xy is equal to two.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.870
This is the equation of our curve.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.160
And we know that dy, dx

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.940
is equal to y

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.740
over 3y squared minus x.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.400
So one thing we could do is, well,

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.570
let's just figure out
what the derivative of x

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.900
with respect to y is and set
that to be equal to zero.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.880
So this is the derivative
of y with respect to x.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.140
If we take the reciprocal of that,

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.220
the derivative of x with respect to y,

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.300
it's just the reciprocal of this,

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.020
is going to be the reciprocal
of what we have here.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.520
So it's going to be 3y squared

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.375
minus x over y.

00:02:27.375 --> 00:02:29.680
And if we want this to be equal to zero,

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.150
like we said right over here,

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.600
well then that's only going to happen

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.856
if the numerator is equal to zero.

00:02:34.856 --> 00:02:36.830
So we could say, okay, at what x, y pair

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.680
does this numerator equal to zero?

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.950
3y squared minus x is equal to zero.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.980
Can add x to both sides
and you get 3y squared

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.580
is equal to x.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.460
Now, another way you could
have thought about it is,

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.720
well, at what x and y
values does the derivative

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.100
of y with respect to x become undefined?

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.560
Well, that's gonna become undefined

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.220
if the denominator here is zero.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.300
But when you're dealing
with things like undefined,

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.480
it gets a little bit more hand-wavy.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.480
I like to just think of
this as the rate at which x

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.480
is changing with respect to y is zero.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.760
And so that got us to the same conclusion.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.140
Well, for that to be true,

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.300
x has to be equal to 3y squared.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.700
And of course, the x, y
pair has to also satisfy

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.085
the equation for the curve.

00:03:23.085 --> 00:03:25.750
So why don't we use both
of these constraints,

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.874
and then we can solve for x and y?

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:30.200
And so the easiest thing
I can think of doing

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.460
is let's substitute x

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.140
with 3y squared because they are the same,

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.560
that's the second constraint.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.860
So if we take our original
equation of the curve,

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.210
we get y to the third minus,

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.546
instead of writing x, I could 3y squared.

00:03:44.546 --> 00:03:48.360
3y squared times y

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.088
is equal to two.

00:03:50.088 --> 00:03:52.980
And so we get y to the third

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.809
minus 3y to the third is equal to two.

00:03:56.809 --> 00:04:00.050
This is negative 2y to the third

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:01.320
is equal to two.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.830
Can divide both sides by negative two

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.180
and we get y to the third

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.790
is equal to negative one,

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.540
or y is equal to negative one.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.430
Negative one to the third
power is negative one.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.780
Now if y is negative one, what is x?

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.614
Well, x is going to be equal to three

00:04:20.614 --> 00:04:24.566
times negative one squared.

00:04:24.566 --> 00:04:26.540
So negative one squared is just one,

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.660
so x is going to be equal to three.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.760
So the point on that curve
at which the tangent line

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.840
is vertical is going to be the point

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.884
three, comma, negative one.

00:04:37.884 --> 00:04:39.680
And we are all done.
