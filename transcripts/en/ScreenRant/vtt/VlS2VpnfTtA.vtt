00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:11.250
No matter how serious, every movie is made
with the assumption that fans will be looking

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.320
at the exact characters, objects, or action
that the director intends. But sometimes,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.199
people wind up watching anything but. Whether
it's overzealous extras, subtle jokes, or

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.690
mistakes from the crew, sometimes watching
the background of a movie scene can be twice

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.869
as much fun. If you like this video make sure
you stick around until the end for links to

Rant's 10 Hilarious Details Hidden In Popular

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.300
Films.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.300
The Godfather

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.930
In a perfect world, movie audiences would
never even notice a background actor, since

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.139
they should be invisible - if they're doing
their job. The Godfather is hailed as one

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:52.249
of cinema's greatest films, but even IT falls
victim to one hilarious blown take, thanks

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:56.819
to an extra who steps into frame well ahead
of her mark. Once you see her pop into view

00:00:56.819 --> 00:01:02.679
and quickly sneak back out, you'll notice
it every time.

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:06.140
Gladiator&nbsp;

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.430
Director Ridley Scott had to rely on computers
to recreate Rome's massive Colosseum, and

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.229
the thousands of spectators sitting inside
it. But background extras were also needed

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.140
for closer scenes, which opened the door to
some less-than-historic cameos. Like the audience

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.509
member creeping over his fellow Romans to
make sure he gets into the entire frame of

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:25.990
the camera that really isn't supposed to be
there.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:32.039
The Hobbit: Battle of The Five Armies

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:35.929
Peter Jackson's trilogy may star a Hobbit
and a squad of Dwarves, but it's the Elves

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:43.740
who show up to help save the day, with thousands
and thousands of soldiers, too. The Hobbit

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.630
Trilogy took some flack for using too much
CG, but that wasn't a problem for this scene:

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.450
every single one of the elves is given the
exact same face, copied and pasted over and

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:01.009
over again. Unless elves mastered cloning,
it's one massive detail the effects team overlooked.

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.549
Speed

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.069
Getting a city bus up to 50 miles per hour
isn't easy in any situation, but threatening

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.870
to blow it up did the job for Speed. The action
takes place on freeways, city streets, and

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.849
even an airport, with the constant threat
of an explosion keeping viewers' eyes stuck

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.390
on the bus. It's a good thing, too - otherwise
they might notice the cameraman filming the

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.450
action, not even&nbsp;trying&nbsp;to stay hidden from
prying eyes.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.450
The Hunger Games

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.099
In the world of Panem, nothing is as important
or terrifying as The Hunger Games. With each

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:38.671
and every boy and girl of age eligible to
be drafted into a battle to the death, the

00:02:38.671 --> 00:02:43.640
selection ceremony is tense to say the least.
But not for everyone, since one little girl

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.200
in the crowd is apparently more interested
in her fingernails than her life being on

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.450
the line. Kidsâ€¦

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.299
You Only Live Twice

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.519
The only thing as famous as this James Bond
movie's villain is his signature white cat.

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.629
But even if Blofeld managed to keep his cool
while his base was overrun, the cat was a

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.090
different story. Apparently nobody thought
about what would happen once an explosion

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.720
was set off next to the animal, which means
audiences can watch as the cat loses its mind

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.909
in real time, forcing actor Donald Pleasence
to keep it in a death grip just to get through

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:19.879
the scene.

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:23.180
Death Proof

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.230
Quentin Tarantino doesn't usually try to hide
the movies and characters that influence him,

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.400
and Death Proof is no exception. When the
leading ladies are enjoying drinks and dancing

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.709
before Kurt Russell's villain enters the picture,
he's already been introduced... sort of. It's

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.719
no surprise to learn that Russell's role as
Jack Burton in Big Trouble in Little China

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:44.961
is one of Tarantino's favorites - a fact made
clear by the hero's tanktop hanging from the

00:03:44.961 --> 00:03:48.750
bar's wall.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.290
Star Wars: Attack of The Clones

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.270
The first Star Wars prequel may get some of
the harshest criticism of the series, but

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.750
the tie-in video game has a lot more fans.
Star Wars: Episode 1 Racer put players behind

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.780
the controls of their very own pod racer,
and they weren't alone. When Anakin and Obi-Wan

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.440
head into a nightclub in Attack of the Clones,
actual footage of the game is shown - apparently,

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.629
it's just as much of a spectator sport as
droid football.

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:16.629
The LEGO Movie

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:22.090
Most of the inside jokes and references in
The LEGO Movie make sense once viewers realize

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.920
they're watching a young boy playing with
his father's carefully-constructed LEGO sets.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.260
But one joke managed to slip by plenty of
fans. When the heroes first take a trip to

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.770
Cloud Cuckoo Land, the random blend of toys,
themes, and characters makes absolutely no

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:42.190
sense whatsoever. It's never spelled out,
but when the boy's father is revealed later

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.790
in the movie, he points out the LEGO and toys
his son IS allowed to play with - a box of

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:53.590
mismatched toys in a cardboard box, complete
with a "Cloud Movers" logo.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.640
Kingsman: The Secret Service

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.170
There was one sequence in this spy thriller
that no fan could ever forget, pitting star

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:08.070
Colin Firth up against a church full of rampaging
maniacs. The actor trained for months to be

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.290
able to pull off most of his own stunts, and
the frantic ballet of over the top violence

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:17.530
is almost flawless. Until you notice the one
background actor who is less than bloodthirsty,

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.560
swinging a chair so gently he's barely breaking
a sweat.&nbsp;

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.390
Those are the jokes, easter eggs, and mistakes
in movie backgrounds that caught our attention,

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.230
