00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:06.260
Babies with beards and cups of warm kitty.
Take it easy, because we are about to loose

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:10.120
control.
It's episode 49 of IMG!

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:18.740
Okay, whose legs are whose?
And can you find the hidden scary face?

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.020
If Pac-Man has a skull, it probably looks
like this.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:27.190
And Information Is Beautiful analyzed horoscopes
to create a visualization of the most commonly

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.390
used words by sign.
Words in red were uniquely common for each

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.270
sign.
The Earth orbits on a tilt, so as the year

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.590
progresses, the terminator, the line marking
the border between night and day sways back

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.300
and forth.
These pictures were all taken at 6 a.m. from

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:51.729
September 2010 to September 2011, giving us
an incredible time lapse of day and night

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:55.520
on Earth for one year.
Makes you a bit dizzy?

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.749
Well, just be sure you don't puke ribbons.
Oh, a facelifting cream.

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:04.550
Ooops.
The lines on a parking lot can be dandelions

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:11.720
and Craig Alan painted these portraits of
famous faces, made out of people standing around.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.540
Here's a cat... but where does it end?
Oookay.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.720
This cat isn't as big, but the mess he made is.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.000
And Kerry Skarbakka uses rock climbing equipment,
safe landing mats or sometimes nothing to

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.100
make these photos of himself falling.
Seth Casteel captures dogs falling into water.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.760
And Robert Downey Jr. as a pin-up girl is
something fun to gawk at.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.280
Though you can also gawk at Michelangelo's
Sistine Chapel by using the Vatican's amazing

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.660
virtual tour.
It's almost more of a DONG than an IMG, but

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.479
go ahead, look around with the mouse and zoom
in and out by scrolling.

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.939
The art is amazing, but let's be honest.
All paintings are better with cats added.

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:14.980
Now this hurts my brain.
Moving dots, whose meaning is ambiguous, we

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:21.760
can add cues that make it look like a spinning
helix or enable a different cue that turns

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.640
it into a waving ribbon.
Still crazier, a cue that turns your perception

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.760
of the whole thing into a chain of flat moving bulges.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.719
I love these photographs of people whose arms
melt into the horizon.

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:40.400
Oh, and this roller-coaster?
It's actually a walking coaster.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.889
The loop, though, is pretty much impossible to travel.

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:49.489
I Love Graphs showed off a sweet chocolate
chart and Palindrome.

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.400
Get it?
On Facebook.com/VsauceGaming you guys have

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.010
been awesome.
Manuel points out a can't-unsee-fact about

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.489
the ampersand.
Ashley showed us a grandfather clock with

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.430
an attitude.
And Garett suggested a clever Easter prank.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.409
Oh and Shelby said "Ladies..."
Here's an artist who draws shoes turning into

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:17.980
umbrellas and has also built super-cool squashed-bug
wallpaper, tables that collide, do backflips

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.959
and play Twister.
Yayoi Kusama put a blank white room in a museum

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.260
and then gave stickers to kids, who could
place them anywhere.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.640
It was fun.
And after long enough, it got pretty gosh darn

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.500
awesome.
So is the room of heights, where

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.360
visitors were asked to measure and mark their
own height on a wall, eventually leaving a

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.060
thick human-height-sized band across the room.
Too analytical?

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.989
Well how about we just get a giant helium
balloon covered in charcoal spikes.

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.609
Batting it around draws on the walls.
If your car gets stuck you might need camel

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:59.120
to...wing.
And this week, 9Gag showed me that tortoise

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.969
still has a few tricks up his shell.
Ned Hardy displayed Star Wars if Doctor Seuss

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:08.799
had written it.
And Cecilia Paredes paints herself to hide,

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:14.159
just like Bolin, except she often leaves her
hair and eyes strikingly visible.

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:19.119
I leave you with a mystery.
An optical illusion consisting of moving dots

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.740
and circles, but what's crazy is that we,
to this day, do not know why our brains add

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:32.870
this illusory contour connecting the dots.
There's no known mechanism or theory yet proposed

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.850
to explain what we see.
If you figure it out, you should probably

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.150
let science know, but until then...
As always, thanks for watching.
