1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:01,610
The Vertebra.

2
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:06,610
Adaptive immune system is one of the
most complex and most beautiful pieces of

3
00:00:07,281 --> 00:00:12,020
biological architecture that
we know of and its complexity.

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:17,350
Its precision and its power indicate
a long history of coevolution with

5
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:19,124
pathogens.

6
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:25,690
The adaptive immune system is slower
and more precise than the innate immune

7
00:00:27,381 --> 00:00:29,930
system and it has the capacity for memory.

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:37,190
The vertebrate immune system
is of a type discussed here,

9
00:00:37,191 --> 00:00:42,191
found only invertebrates but
it also exists is analogs
in some invertebrates and

10
00:00:44,121 --> 00:00:48,080
vertebrates at evolved at least twice.
Once in jawless fish,

11
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:53,230
lampreys and hagfish and then in the
jaw of vertebrates the two systems share

12
00:00:53,871 --> 00:00:58,871
some design features but they originated
independently in George vertebrates.

13
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:03,200
The key event was incorporating
a transposable genetic
element of carried two

14
00:01:03,201 --> 00:01:05,390
genes,
rag one and rag two.

15
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:11,570
Those two genes carry the machinery
that enables the somatic recombination,

16
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:15,680
the generates antibody and
t cell receptor diversity.

17
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:17,650
Yeah.

18
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,930
Does that diversity that gives the
system is flexibility to recognize a huge

19
00:01:21,931 --> 00:01:26,610
range of molecules, pathogens that
have never been encountered before,

20
00:01:26,611 --> 00:01:29,400
but also microbial self,

21
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,590
self nor microbial
nonself and food antigens.

22
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:41,200
This would be one of the reasons
that we react to food allergies.

23
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:46,900
The specificities of the antigen
receptors are those not genetically

24
00:01:46,901 --> 00:01:47,800
predetermined?

25
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:52,330
The receptors are assembled from
fragments of gene products by somatic

26
00:01:52,331 --> 00:01:54,820
recombination mediated by rag genes.

27
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,513
Okay.

28
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:02,740
The major histocompatibility complex
produces molecules of two types,

29
00:02:02,961 --> 00:02:06,980
class one and class two.
They first evolved in cartilaginous fish,

30
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:12,680
both present fragments of proteins on
cell surfaces for recognition by t cell

31
00:02:12,681 --> 00:02:15,770
receptors, so they're part of
the presentation mechanism.

32
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:22,090
MHC class one molecules occur in all
nucleated cells or they present viral

33
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:25,220
proteins during intracellular infections.

34
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,840
Class two molecules
occur in dendritic cells,

35
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,090
macrophages and B cells,

36
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,290
and these are the cells that present
antigenic peptides from extracellular

37
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:39,560
sources such as those from
phagocytosed bacteria.

38
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:42,150
Okay.

39
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,440
MHC class one and two genes are highly
polymorphic with many illegals that are

40
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:48,240
circulating in the human population.

41
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,810
These jeans are code dominant.

42
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:58,300
That means each or Lele is contributing
to the pool of peptides that combine to

43
00:02:58,301 --> 00:02:59,134
form.

44
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:01,870
Yeah.

45
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,250
In an outbred population.

46
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:07,180
Most individuals are
heterozygous for most MHC genes,

47
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:13,050
so most of us are carrying a huge
library of variants that can be brought

48
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:16,630
together in different combinations,

49
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:21,631
astronomically large number of
combinations to deal with a huge array of

50
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,410
proteins that are coming in from
pathogens and other sources.

51
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:28,950
Yeah.

52
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,720
In terms of tissues and organs,

53
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:35,640
the lymphocytes arise from
stem cells in bone marrow.

54
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,480
So much of that is produced in the large
bones of the leg in the hip and the t

55
00:03:42,601 --> 00:03:44,850
lymphocytes mature in the Thymus,

56
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,680
which is at the base of the throat
and the B lymphocytes in bone marrow,

57
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,880
they migrate to lymph
nodes, spleen, tonsils,

58
00:03:53,881 --> 00:03:56,970
appendix and payer's
patches for processing.

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So you should think of your immune system
is having being distributed all over

60
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:03,054
the body,

61
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:08,450
but having a particular network
that is the focus of action.

62
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:15,650
They are activated by antigen in these
organs and they circulate between blood,

63
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:20,340
lymph and those other Oregon's until
they encounter their specific antigens.

64
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:25,440
So they are continually
circulating through the body.

65
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,153
You're on patrol.

66
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:30,000
Okay.

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,610
When hematopoietic stem
cells leave the bone marrow,

68
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:37,230
they either differentiate into lymphoid
progenitors and those migrate to the

69
00:04:37,231 --> 00:04:38,064
Thymus.

70
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,260
Those would be t cells or
they differentiate into
myeloid progenitors that

71
00:04:43,261 --> 00:04:47,330
become monocytes migrate to tissues
where they differentiate into immature or

72
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,420
myeloid cells such as dendritic
cells and macrophages.

73
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,920
So this diverse population of immune
cells is actually all coming out of the

74
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:59,070
same stem cell progenitor
population and the bone marrow.

75
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,020
Okay.

76
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:05,130
When immature dendritic cells in
counter and antigen, the internalize it,

77
00:05:05,131 --> 00:05:09,000
digest it, take fragments of it,
put them onto their cell surface,

78
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:14,340
migrate to lymph nodes, and they're,
they activate so-called naive t cells,

79
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:19,370
t cells that have not
yet been put into action.

80
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:21,310
Okay.

81
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:25,480
During migration, the dendritic
cells mature during that period,

82
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:28,090
they lose their ability
to engulf pathogens.

83
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,990
That means that they're only going to
be expressing one kind of pathogen when

84
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:36,970
they encounter that t cell
and they develop an increased
ability to communicate

85
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:41,530
with t cells.
So they come in to the lymph node,

86
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,470
able to deliver one clear signal.

87
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:47,920
Okay.

88
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,180
Cytotoxic t cells that are activated by
their druidic cells then undergo rapid

89
00:05:52,181 --> 00:05:54,760
clonal expansion and
migrate throughout the body.

90
00:05:54,761 --> 00:05:57,070
In search of cells
exhibiting corresponding

91
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,280
t cells kill cells.

92
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,050
They do it either by secreting
Porphyrin or similar substances,

93
00:06:06,051 --> 00:06:09,320
the damage the cell membrane and
cause the cell to swell and lice.

94
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,800
Or they give it a signal of apoptosis,

95
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:17,120
which causes the target silver shrink
and die. They tell it to commit suicide.

96
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:24,590
Hematopoietic stem cells that do not
migrate to the thymus and mature in the

97
00:06:24,591 --> 00:06:29,180
bone marrow yield the antigen
specific precursors of B cells.

98
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:34,940
The B cell precursors migrate
to [inaudible] secondary
lymphoid organs such as

99
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:36,290
lymph nodes and spleen.

100
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,690
And when the B cell
receptors recognize antigens,

101
00:06:41,691 --> 00:06:46,280
then B lymphocytes activate and
undergo rapid clonal expansion,

102
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,880
gaining increased ability to recognize
foreign antigens being lymphocytes

103
00:06:51,981 --> 00:06:56,000
recognize and present antigens and
they function in immune memory.

104
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,020
Okay,

105
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,950
so here's the menagerie of
cells in the immune system.

106
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,810
They all start with a plurry
potent metapod stem cell.

107
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:13,350
They can produce the lymphoid progenitor
a mile or a myeloid progenitor or a

108
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:17,110
mega carrier site or an arrhythmia blast.

109
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,160
So our red blood cells are also
coming from the same source.

110
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:26,260
The macrophage progenitors can produce
neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils,

111
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,790
and monocytes.

112
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,620
And the lymphoid progenitors
are producing B cells, t cells,

113
00:07:32,621 --> 00:07:36,760
and natural killer cells as well
as immature dendritic cells.

114
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,680
So those are the main players in terms
of cell types in the adaptive immune

115
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:44,764
system.

116
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:47,790
Okay.

117
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:52,290
So the B cells secrete antibodies.
The t cells have several functions.

118
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:57,180
The natural killer and k cells can kill
virus infected cells before they burst.

119
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,390
Yeah.

120
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,040
The,
among the myeloid cells,

121
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:05,480
the macrophages eat bacteria and
activate bacterial killing mechanisms.

122
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,650
They present antigens.

123
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,550
The dendritic cells take up antigen and
tissue and presented in lymph nodes.

124
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,840
The others released signals from their
granules when they're activated during

125
00:08:14,841 --> 00:08:16,250
the adaptive immune response,

126
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:22,150
eosinophils kill large antibody coated
multicellular parasites and mass cells

127
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,610
trigger inflammatory
responses and tissues.

128
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:30,680
So they have specialized functions
and they coordinate their responses by

129
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:31,610
talking to each other.

130
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,330
The adaptive immune system is activated
by the innate immune system and it

131
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:42,080
relies upon it to know what type
of pathogen is responding to

132
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:48,260
it's key features or somatic generation
of diverse antigen receptors.

133
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:53,000
And then clonal selection of cells
with receptors that match pathogen

134
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:53,893
antibodies.

135
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:55,850
Okay.

136
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,020
The adaptive immune system,

137
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:00,110
this operates using the
principle of natural selection.

138
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:05,860
It selects clones to respond
to specific antigen signals.
