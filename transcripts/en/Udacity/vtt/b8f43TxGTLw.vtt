00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.590
How do we use pre-processing. We know that we can find structures like these in our graph.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:11.900
And here can be other connections possibly--it don't have to be, but we'll ignore those for now.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.379
Now, if we look at this structure from a brute force perspective, there are eight different possibilities

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.470
for assigning or not assigning these vertices here into a vertex cover.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:26.270
The eight possibilities are as follows: either we can take no vertex at all into the vertex cover

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.060
and you already know that this going to cause a problem and we could take all of them

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.410
into the vertex cover, and then then the six more combinations.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.650
A brute force search tree would look at eight possible assignments.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.600
Out of these eight assignments, if you were to design a search tree that directly

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.790
branches into these cases here, there's only five cases that would even make sense.

00:00:48.790 --> 99:59:59.000
Please check which of these cases would make sense for a search tree.
