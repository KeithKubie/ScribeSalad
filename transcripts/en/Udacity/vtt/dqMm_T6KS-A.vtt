00:00:03.507 --> 00:00:06.187
We hope you've enjoyed learning
a little bit about what the OMSCS is

00:00:06.187 --> 00:00:07.689
going to be like.

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:10.740
More importantly, we hope we've helped
set you up for success in the program.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.831
&gt;&gt; If you'd like to give us any
feedback on this orientation,

00:00:14.831 --> 00:00:17.449
there's a survey link
provided in the notes below.

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.238
We'd love to hear if there are things
you like to see included in a future

00:00:21.238 --> 00:00:23.008
version of this orientation, or

00:00:23.008 --> 00:00:25.808
if there are things we could
have explained better.

00:00:25.808 --> 00:00:28.431
&gt;&gt; Congratulations on your
acceptance in this program.

00:00:28.431 --> 00:00:30.428
Welcome to Georgia Tech.

00:00:30.428 --> 00:00:31.558
Now get ready for

00:00:31.558 --> 00:00:35.606
a hell of a ride on your way to
becoming a hell of an engineer.
