00:00:01.101 --> 00:00:03.903
It's been a wild week here
in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

00:00:03.936 --> 00:00:05.638
where we definitely are

00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:07.673
with our comedians
fighting tooth and nail

00:00:07.706 --> 00:00:10.810
for a spot in tonight's final
at the non-trademark-infringing,

00:00:10.843 --> 00:00:12.512
coincidentally
Olympic-style tournament.

00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:14.313
-Please don't sue us.
-(laughter)

00:00:14.346 --> 00:00:17.216
Already this week,
we've eliminated a Russian,

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:19.919
learned how much Canadians sweat

00:00:19.952 --> 00:00:22.455
and suspended a competitor
for doping.

00:00:22.488 --> 00:00:23.990
(laughter)

00:00:24.023 --> 00:00:25.725
-(applause)
-A very dramatic...

00:00:25.758 --> 00:00:27.994
Very dramatic week.

00:00:28.027 --> 00:00:31.030
Now we're left with three of
the world's greatest comedians

00:00:31.063 --> 00:00:34.200
going head-to-head to see
who will bring home the gold

00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:36.102
and who will
just bring home Zika.

00:00:36.135 --> 00:00:37.503
(laughter)

00:00:37.536 --> 00:00:40.373
They're gonna take it home
and spread it.

00:00:40.406 --> 00:00:43.176
-Gonna be the zombie apocalypse.
-(laughter)

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:44.844
Figure out which loved ones
you'd have to take out

00:00:44.877 --> 00:00:46.079
when they get it first.

00:00:46.112 --> 00:00:47.547
Then look around and figure out

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.115
who you'd have
to repopulate with

00:00:49.148 --> 00:00:51.250
-once the zombie apocalypse
starts. -(cheering)

00:00:51.283 --> 00:00:53.186
Don't worry. The zombie
apocalypse will prevent

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.720
a Trump presidency.

00:00:54.753 --> 00:00:58.958
(applause and cheering)

00:00:58.991 --> 00:01:00.359
Let's meet our finalists.

00:01:00.392 --> 00:01:02.261
First up,
representing Great Britain,

00:01:02.294 --> 00:01:04.630
the nation that brought us
movies you go see with your mom,

00:01:04.663 --> 00:01:06.766
and charming ways
to say the word (bleep)--

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.469
it's Gina Yashere.

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:11.003
(grand orchestral theme plays)

00:01:11.036 --> 00:01:13.006
(applause and cheering)

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:19.545
Next up, representing Germany,

00:01:19.578 --> 00:01:21.781
a proud nation,
but not too proud,

00:01:21.814 --> 00:01:25.418
'cause they know it makes you
nervous-- Flula Borg!

00:01:25.451 --> 00:01:29.322
(applause and cheering)

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:31.724
Hello.

00:01:31.757 --> 00:01:33.026
Hi.

00:01:35.194 --> 00:01:37.564
HARDWICK:
Oh, you're on the, uh... Yeah.

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:41.667
And finally,
representing Uzbekistan,

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.203
a nation probably known
for its... hats...

00:01:44.236 --> 00:01:48.641
and let's just say autumn
goat festivals probably--

00:01:48.674 --> 00:01:51.010
Milana Vayntrub!

00:01:51.043 --> 00:01:53.980
(applause and cheering)

00:02:04.757 --> 00:02:06.759
Comedians,
now that you are within reach

00:02:06.792 --> 00:02:08.628
of bringing your nation
eternal glory,

00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:10.897
how will your home countries
celebrate your victory?

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.465
-Gina.
-Well, obviously,

00:02:12.498 --> 00:02:14.700
I'm from Great Britain,
and we give back.

00:02:14.733 --> 00:02:17.270
So, when I win... (giggles)

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:21.641
...uh, we will be giving out
free English lessons

00:02:21.674 --> 00:02:24.010
-to all Americans.
-(laughter)

00:02:24.043 --> 00:02:26.045
-HARDWICK: What?
-Yes.

00:02:26.078 --> 00:02:27.880
(applause and cheering)

00:02:27.913 --> 00:02:29.682
-Yes. It's...
-HARDWICK: What the hell?

00:02:29.715 --> 00:02:32.818
Listen, you've bastardized
the language. It's "herb,"

00:02:32.851 --> 00:02:34.353
not "'erb." It's "herb!"

00:02:34.386 --> 00:02:35.521
HARDWICK:
All right,

00:02:35.554 --> 00:02:37.590
uh, Flula Borg?

00:02:37.623 --> 00:02:38.758
Oh, uh, sorry, Chris.

00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:40.159
Actually,
we are still not allowed

00:02:40.192 --> 00:02:41.661
to celebrate anything, so...

00:02:41.694 --> 00:02:43.462
-(laughter)
-HARDWICK: Okay. Fair enough.

00:02:43.495 --> 00:02:45.264
Fair enough.

00:02:45.297 --> 00:02:48.034
(applause and cheering)

00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:50.570
Milana Vayntrub.

00:02:50.603 --> 00:02:53.005
Uh, we'll celebrate the same way
we do everything, Chris--

00:02:53.038 --> 00:02:54.571
with no media coverage.
