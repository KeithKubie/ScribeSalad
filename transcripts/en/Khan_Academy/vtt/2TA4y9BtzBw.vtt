00:00:00.291 --> 00:00:02.282
- [Instructor] When we
think of British colonies

00:00:02.282 --> 00:00:04.532
in the Americas before 1776

00:00:05.654 --> 00:00:09.029
we tend to think of the 13 colonies.

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:13.827
Those colonies that were located
along the eastern seaboard

00:00:13.827 --> 00:00:16.522
of North America and which rebelled

00:00:16.522 --> 00:00:19.125
as a group in the American Revolution.

00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:22.042
But if you were standing in London,

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:23.843
say 1770,

00:00:25.803 --> 00:00:27.900
and you were thinking about British

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.680
colonies in the New World,

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.771
it's more likely that your thoughts

00:00:31.771 --> 00:00:35.366
would have turned to the Caribbean,

00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:39.533
what they called the West
Indies and the sugar islands

00:00:41.025 --> 00:00:42.942
of Jamaica or Barbados,

00:00:46.994 --> 00:00:50.481
than say the colony of New Jersey.

00:00:50.481 --> 00:00:53.519
Because even though this was quite

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:56.547
a gigantic swath of territory,

00:00:56.547 --> 00:00:59.591
these tiny little islands in the Caribbean

00:00:59.591 --> 00:01:03.913
were incredibly profitable
for English investors.

00:01:03.913 --> 00:01:07.413
Because sugar was a commodity that fetched

00:01:08.486 --> 00:01:11.886
very high prices in the Colonial Era.

00:01:11.886 --> 00:01:16.336
In this video I want to focus
on the southern colonies

00:01:16.336 --> 00:01:19.915
and the British colonies in the Caribbean,

00:01:19.915 --> 00:01:24.387
which although they were
somewhat separated in land.

00:01:24.387 --> 00:01:25.870
Got them next to each other here,

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.370
but kinda imagine that
this is the tip of Florida.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.242
So that belongs down here,

00:01:31.242 --> 00:01:34.019
and all these little
islands in the Caribbean

00:01:34.019 --> 00:01:38.389
are far to the south of
mainland North America.

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:41.008
So what united these colonies,

00:01:41.008 --> 00:01:43.869
even though they were
divided in geography,

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.036
is that they were plantation colonies.

00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:52.321
They were in southern or tropical regions,

00:01:52.321 --> 00:01:56.536
which meant that they
had long growing seasons

00:01:56.536 --> 00:02:00.286
that made them ideal
for planting cash crops.

00:02:01.532 --> 00:02:05.699
That is crops that are
specifically grown to be sold.

00:02:06.642 --> 00:02:09.003
Now we've already talked
a little bit about

00:02:09.003 --> 00:02:12.836
the crops of Virginia,
which would be tobacco,

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.887
but in this video I want to talk

00:02:15.887 --> 00:02:19.138
a little bit more about two other crops.

00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:22.488
Sugar, which was grown in the Caribbean,

00:02:22.488 --> 00:02:26.071
and rice, which was
grown in the Carolinas.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.618
Growing these cash crops for export

00:02:30.618 --> 00:02:33.590
was the main focus of these colonies,

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.298
and their social structures were organized

00:02:36.298 --> 00:02:39.331
around producing those cash crops.

00:02:39.331 --> 00:02:41.217
So let's talk bout sugar.

00:02:41.217 --> 00:02:44.040
Now we hardly think about consuming sugar

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.957
in our tea or coffee today,

00:02:45.957 --> 00:02:49.658
but in the Colonial Era it
was an incredible luxury

00:02:49.658 --> 00:02:52.647
and it commanded very high prices.

00:02:52.647 --> 00:02:54.915
One of the reasons for this is because

00:02:54.915 --> 00:02:58.582
sugar was extremely
labor intensive to make.

00:03:00.584 --> 00:03:04.648
The sugarcane plant is
actually indigenous to Asia,

00:03:04.648 --> 00:03:07.348
but Europeans brought it to the New World

00:03:07.348 --> 00:03:10.521
with the hopes of turning
it into a cash crop.

00:03:10.521 --> 00:03:14.717
They planted it in the
tropical areas of the Caribbean

00:03:14.717 --> 00:03:18.050
and then they imported enslaved Africans

00:03:19.956 --> 00:03:23.673
to work on their sugar plantations.

00:03:23.673 --> 00:03:26.514
Now you can see a little
bit in these two prints

00:03:26.514 --> 00:03:29.889
of what sugar processing was like.

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:32.820
You would have to grow the cane stalks,

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.084
press the juice from them,

00:03:35.084 --> 00:03:38.816
boil the juice until it created crystals.

00:03:38.816 --> 00:03:41.722
Sugar processing happened 24/7,

00:03:41.722 --> 00:03:45.066
and unlike tobacco you
really had to be very wealthy

00:03:45.066 --> 00:03:47.079
to grow sugar because it required

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:49.884
a huge capital investment upfront.

00:03:49.884 --> 00:03:53.603
You had to buy a lot of land
and grow a lot of sugarcane

00:03:53.603 --> 00:03:57.037
and get a lot of machinery if you hoped

00:03:57.037 --> 00:03:59.475
to produce enough to make a profit.

00:03:59.475 --> 00:04:04.213
So a handful of very
wealthy plantation owners,

00:04:04.213 --> 00:04:08.380
who mostly stayed in England
because the tropical diseases

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.561
of the Caribbean were too
likely to kill them off.

00:04:13.561 --> 00:04:17.597
These sugar barons had
unimaginable wealth.

00:04:17.597 --> 00:04:20.239
The tobacco planters of Virginia

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.108
were nothing compared to them.

00:04:22.108 --> 00:04:25.333
And they were ruthless
about turning a profit.

00:04:25.333 --> 00:04:28.886
In fact they thought that
it would be more profitable

00:04:28.886 --> 00:04:32.658
in the event of the
deaths of enslaved people

00:04:32.658 --> 00:04:35.741
from overwork or disease or some kind

00:04:36.861 --> 00:04:39.612
of accident in sugar processing,

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:42.279
to just replace enslaved workers

00:04:44.714 --> 00:04:48.297
rather than make their
work less dangerous.

00:04:49.258 --> 00:04:53.725
Growing sugar was so profitable
that the Caribbean islands,

00:04:53.725 --> 00:04:57.892
which were so small, couldn't
even spare room to grow food.

00:04:58.836 --> 00:05:01.580
They imported all their
food from elsewhere

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.885
so that every square inch of
arable land in the Caribbean

00:05:05.885 --> 00:05:08.050
could be used to grow sugar.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.217
Now with so many enslaved people
coming into the Caribbean,

00:05:14.431 --> 00:05:18.598
by the mid 1600s, enslaved
Africans in the Caribbean

00:05:20.433 --> 00:05:22.850
far outnumbered white people.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.310
And consequently the white slave owners

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.487
became increasingly
fearful of slave uprisings.

00:05:34.432 --> 00:05:36.464
So plantation owners who were,

00:05:36.464 --> 00:05:39.451
of course, in control of
the colonial government

00:05:39.451 --> 00:05:42.701
began to crack down on enslaved people,

00:05:43.675 --> 00:05:47.758
codifying the racial status
of enslaved Africans.

00:05:49.032 --> 00:05:52.115
In 1661, Barbados passed a slave code

00:05:54.432 --> 00:05:56.599
that was incredibly harsh.

00:05:57.941 --> 00:06:00.909
I won't go into all of it
here but the gist of it

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:04.196
was that the lives of
enslaved Africans were

00:06:04.196 --> 00:06:06.994
to be very closely monitored.

00:06:06.994 --> 00:06:09.994
They would require passes to travel.

00:06:11.617 --> 00:06:13.700
They had no legal rights.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:19.087
And if a slave owner maimed
or killed an enslaved person

00:06:20.514 --> 00:06:23.097
there would be no repercussions

00:06:24.604 --> 00:06:26.854
for that violence or death.

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:32.339
We will see aspects of
the Barbados Slave Act

00:06:33.271 --> 00:06:37.438
in the statutes passed in the
southern mainland colonies,

00:06:38.527 --> 00:06:41.920
and later southern states
in the United states.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.158
And although we tend to
think of plantation slavery

00:06:45.158 --> 00:06:48.887
generally looking like
the slavery we would see

00:06:48.887 --> 00:06:52.050
later in Georgia or South Carolina,

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.851
large cotton plantations,

00:06:53.851 --> 00:06:57.434
for the vast majority
of enslaved Africans,

00:06:58.333 --> 00:07:00.845
their experience would have been much more

00:07:00.845 --> 00:07:02.825
like what we saw in the Caribbean.

00:07:02.825 --> 00:07:06.325
In fact, 90 percent of all enslaved people

00:07:08.507 --> 00:07:11.633
were sent to the Caribbean
or South America.

00:07:11.633 --> 00:07:15.766
Only a little over 300,000 would be sent

00:07:15.766 --> 00:07:17.905
to mainland North America.

00:07:17.905 --> 00:07:21.989
So if you're looking for
the most typical experience

00:07:21.989 --> 00:07:23.792
of slavery from the point of view

00:07:23.792 --> 00:07:25.798
of the people who lived it,

00:07:25.798 --> 00:07:29.430
life on the sugar plantation
was a much more likely

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:33.369
prospect than life on a cotton plantation.

00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:36.672
In fact it was English
planters in the Caribbean

00:07:36.672 --> 00:07:40.329
who decided that they might strike north

00:07:40.329 --> 00:07:42.877
to create a new plantation colony,

00:07:42.877 --> 00:07:47.637
which they called Carolina
after the English King Charles.

00:07:47.637 --> 00:07:51.804
Now Carolina was founded
as one big colony in 1670,

00:07:55.025 --> 00:07:58.942
but by 1712 it was
separated into two colonies,

00:08:00.081 --> 00:08:02.914
North Carolina and South Carolina.

00:08:05.856 --> 00:08:10.023
And the wealthy plantation
owners who founded Charles Town,

00:08:11.354 --> 00:08:13.238
also named after King Charles,

00:08:13.238 --> 00:08:17.852
brought most of the aspects
of plantation slavery

00:08:17.852 --> 00:08:20.710
they had picked up in
the Caribbean with them.

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:24.622
The Pass System, the lack of legal rights,

00:08:24.622 --> 00:08:27.360
the lack of repercussions for whites.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.787
One main difference, however,

00:08:28.787 --> 00:08:32.287
was that in the Carolinas rice cultivation

00:08:33.581 --> 00:08:36.032
took the place of sugar cultivation

00:08:36.032 --> 00:08:37.865
as the main cash crop.

00:08:38.813 --> 00:08:42.980
Plantation owners quickly
discovered that many West Africans

00:08:45.146 --> 00:08:49.313
had worked on their own rice
farms before enslavement.

00:08:50.662 --> 00:08:54.829
And so they particularly wished
to purchase West Africans

00:08:56.372 --> 00:08:58.701
to work on rice plantations.

00:08:58.701 --> 00:09:01.676
This is an image here
of a rice plantation.

00:09:01.676 --> 00:09:03.091
Obviously, this a photograph,

00:09:03.091 --> 00:09:06.894
so it would be from a
couple hundred years after

00:09:06.894 --> 00:09:08.434
the settlement of the Carolinas,

00:09:08.434 --> 00:09:11.934
but I think it gives you a sense of what

00:09:11.934 --> 00:09:14.424
rice cultivation looked like.

00:09:14.424 --> 00:09:17.173
I want to finish by just
briefly talking about

00:09:17.173 --> 00:09:19.575
the colonies of Maryland and Georgia,

00:09:19.575 --> 00:09:22.109
which were also plantation colonies.

00:09:22.109 --> 00:09:24.383
But I've grouped them together because

00:09:24.383 --> 00:09:27.675
they were both founded
for altruistic reasons.

00:09:27.675 --> 00:09:30.441
They were proprietary colonies originally

00:09:30.441 --> 00:09:32.379
like Pennsylvania, for example,

00:09:32.379 --> 00:09:35.903
meaning that they were the
possessions of one person

00:09:35.903 --> 00:09:38.573
rather than a company or the crown.

00:09:38.573 --> 00:09:43.342
Maryland was founded in
1632 by an English catholic

00:09:43.342 --> 00:09:46.259
named Lord Baltimore who wanted

00:09:46.259 --> 00:09:50.217
to create a haven of religious freedom

00:09:50.217 --> 00:09:52.684
for Catholics in North America.

00:09:52.684 --> 00:09:56.851
In 1649, Maryland passed
the law concerning religion,

00:09:58.303 --> 00:10:01.518
also known as the Maryland
Act of Toleration,

00:10:01.518 --> 00:10:05.248
which extended religious
toleration to everyone

00:10:05.248 --> 00:10:07.753
who believed in Jesus.

00:10:07.753 --> 00:10:10.207
So all Protestants, all Catholics,

00:10:10.207 --> 00:10:12.818
but on the flip side
it prescribed death for

00:10:12.818 --> 00:10:16.753
anyone who did not believe in
Jesus like Jews or Atheists.

00:10:16.753 --> 00:10:20.336
Georgia was founded a
century later in 1732

00:10:21.487 --> 00:10:25.280
by an English humanitarian
named James Oglethorpe.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:29.693
And Oglethorpe was
trying to reform prisons.

00:10:29.693 --> 00:10:32.302
In England people who
couldn't pay their debts

00:10:32.302 --> 00:10:34.880
were thrown into debtors' prison,

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.078
which was kind of silly because
when they were in prison

00:10:38.078 --> 00:10:40.873
they didn't have the
opportunity to try to make money

00:10:40.873 --> 00:10:42.439
to pay back their debts.

00:10:42.439 --> 00:10:45.153
So Oglethorpe founded
the colony of Georgia

00:10:45.153 --> 00:10:48.629
with the idea that people
who were suffering from debt

00:10:48.629 --> 00:10:51.302
could go to this new
colony and work it off.

00:10:51.302 --> 00:10:54.352
And for that reason he
also outlawed slavery

00:10:54.352 --> 00:10:57.852
in the early years of Georgia's existence,

00:10:58.704 --> 00:11:02.704
but by about 1750 the
pressure to include slaves

00:11:03.998 --> 00:11:06.663
in the Georgia economy
so that it could keep up

00:11:06.663 --> 00:11:10.297
with South Carolina, for
example, grew too great.

00:11:10.297 --> 00:11:13.077
And so slavery was permitted.

00:11:13.077 --> 00:11:16.801
So although the colonies
of the West Indies

00:11:16.801 --> 00:11:19.452
and the southern part of North America

00:11:19.452 --> 00:11:20.992
were in different places

00:11:20.992 --> 00:11:24.272
and sometimes founded
for different reasons,

00:11:24.272 --> 00:11:26.437
they were all united by the fact

00:11:26.437 --> 00:11:28.770
that they relied on slavery,

00:11:29.663 --> 00:11:32.686
and in many cases had a much larger

00:11:32.686 --> 00:11:36.066
enslaved African population
than white population.

00:11:36.066 --> 00:11:39.255
And they focused for their economies

00:11:39.255 --> 00:11:41.422
on plantation agriculture.

00:11:43.265 --> 00:11:45.102
Now you'll notice that in this video

00:11:45.102 --> 00:11:47.169
I haven't spent much time talking about

00:11:47.169 --> 00:11:50.371
the experiences of
enslaved African people,

00:11:50.371 --> 00:11:51.966
and that's because I want to devote

00:11:51.966 --> 00:11:53.330
another video to that.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:56.680
So check out our video
