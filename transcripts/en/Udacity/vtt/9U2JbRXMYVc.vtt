00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now let's work through it from the top.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Initially x is 1, and then I define a new function tricky, but I haven't called it yet,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
so I'm not actually going to make any new variable spaces over here.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And then I print out the value of x.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Currently x is 1, and now I call tricky on x,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and we noted before that whenever we make a function call we get a new box

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
corresponding to that function call. This one knows who its parents are,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and this new box is going to have room for all the formal parameters in tricky,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
also x, and this time we're passing in x.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The current value of x is 1, huh, so we've got almost a duplicate sort of state.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So now we're inside tricky, and we say x=x+5.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The real question is: Which one do we change?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The answer is this bottom, more specific one down here.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
This x has shadowed, has taken the place of in our hearts, the old one.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So I change just this one to 6, so here, when I'm printing out the value of x,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
we look in this world, we see a 6, and we print it out.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And now we return from tricky, and when we return from a function call,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
you can imagine we throw away all of its space, and we're back here in the normal world.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Well, what's the value of x here? It's 1.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So this assignment statement, x=x+5, changed the function's actual argument

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
but did not change this more global value of x.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We call these boxes that help us keep track of storage places for variables environments.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Kind of like before, when we were talking about state being a bit like the world,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
you can view a particular environment like Central Asia or Western Europe or Antarctica

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
as being a little region in the world that might have its own values for variables.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
If I want to know what the temperature is, well, it depends on the current environment.

00:01:47.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Are you in the Sahara desert or are you in Northern Sweden?
