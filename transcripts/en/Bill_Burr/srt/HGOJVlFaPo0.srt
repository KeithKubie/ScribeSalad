1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:01,520
Oh

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,820
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

3
00:00:04,821 --> 00:00:07,800
Just before Friday. Monday
morning podcast. And

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:12,970
ahhh

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,690
just checking in on you.
Sorry Cleo.

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,470
My dog just popped up like what the
fuck dude? What's going on everybody?

7
00:00:19,471 --> 00:00:23,950
How are Ya? How's it going? Do you
guys watch any sports lately? Go.

8
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,440
I've what with the baseball there.

9
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,360
Um,
Jesus Christ.

10
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:35,260
What a difference a couple of fucking
days makes my god the fucking Cleveland

11
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,850
Indians up three games to one
looking to end their street to,

12
00:00:40,851 --> 00:00:44,510
did I call it or did I fucking call it?
What did I say?

13
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,850
Did I say it to you guys? I thought
I said that. This is just fitting.

14
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,760
They see that on Monday cause I think
it was three games to two by then.

15
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:56,900
I said that whatever team was going to
fucking win was going to look like they

16
00:00:56,901 --> 00:00:57,681
were going to lose.

17
00:00:57,681 --> 00:01:00,890
So they taught you the shit out of their
fans or whatever team was going to lose.

18
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,620
Who's going to look like they were going
to win because they take their emotions

19
00:01:03,621 --> 00:01:06,680
right through the fucking stratosphere
and then slam them right down on the

20
00:01:06,681 --> 00:01:07,370
pavement.

21
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:12,220
And game seven was literally
the microcosm that that the way,

22
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,030
the way that whole fucking
game played out was basically,

23
00:01:17,031 --> 00:01:20,720
if you ever wanted to know what it was
like to be at Chicago cub or a Cleveland

24
00:01:20,721 --> 00:01:21,554
Indian fan,

25
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,130
and the only reason why they both
didn't face plant each other is because

26
00:01:25,131 --> 00:01:29,990
mathematically it was not an option.
Somebody had to win the fucking thing,

27
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,730
but neither team was just getting,

28
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,710
neither team was just going to win this
fucking series. That was basically it.

29
00:01:36,711 --> 00:01:38,510
That was the point I was
trying to make the other day.

30
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:42,920
They were going to torture the fuck out
of their fans to the point that even if

31
00:01:42,921 --> 00:01:44,120
they did win the thing,

32
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:48,470
you'd still have some sort of nervous
fucking twitch or a tick for like three

33
00:01:48,471 --> 00:01:52,520
days afterwards. Jesus Christ. What a
game. If you didn't watch game seven,

34
00:01:52,521 --> 00:01:56,150
I feel bad for you as a
fucking human being. You know,

35
00:01:56,151 --> 00:01:58,910
as it's fucking 71 degrees in Cleveland,

36
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:01,340
Ohio in November,

37
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,510
there no reason to be concerned.
Let's play it off.

38
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,633
Oh,
Jesus.

39
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,860
Enjoy it. Enjoy. While last people,

40
00:02:08,861 --> 00:02:11,980
before we get to the tipping point where
this global warming thing isn't a fun

41
00:02:11,981 --> 00:02:16,600
thing in November anymore.
Anyways,

42
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:21,140
back to bread and circus. Let's talk a
little baseball here. Dark Ebay's fault.

43
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:22,810
Um,
congratulate

44
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,410
relations to the [inaudible]

45
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:30,010
2016 world series champions.

46
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,690
The fucking Chicago.

47
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,810
I never thought I'd, I'd,
yeah, I didn't. I mean,

48
00:02:35,811 --> 00:02:38,720
I guess I thought I'd say to some point
when it finally saw the red sox winning,

49
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:43,610
congratulations to the cubs fans.
I've been there, you know, and I only,

50
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:47,900
I only lasted, you know, out of the 86
years, I only saw 36 years of it, right?

51
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,760
Of course, you know,
whatever the first 10,

52
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:53,990
you're just a kid running around fucking
sticking shit. It fucking, you know,

53
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,990
you're poking dead skunks and stuff. You
don't give a fuck about a curse, right.

54
00:02:56,991 --> 00:03:00,580
Some from my teen years
on, I, I've suffered for 20
fucking years. If I'm honest.

55
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:01,810
Uh,

56
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:06,810
I vaguely remember 78 and
[inaudible] 86 was my,

57
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,420
was my christening as a red
sox fan. Like, hey bill,

58
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:13,000
this is what it's going to
be like, buckle up. Right?

59
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:17,620
So I've been there and Cleveland Indian
fans, my condolences. I've been there too.

60
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:23,020
I've fucking been there too. But what
a fucking game. That was Jesus Christ.

61
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,600
And you knew what? The cubs had
to go out early. They had a score,

62
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:28,420
a bunch of fucking runs
because as the game went on,

63
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,630
it was going to tip in favor of
the Indians because they had,

64
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:36,631
they had fresh or arms and everybody was
fucking shitting on all fucking the guy

65
00:03:37,361 --> 00:03:39,490
from the devil rays.
I don't know anybody's names by the way.

66
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,010
I don't know anybody's names,

67
00:03:41,011 --> 00:03:43,840
so just fucking deal with it and they
will all shitting on him for putting

68
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,183
Chapman in there.

69
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,220
I'm on the depth chart now so I can look
at the face and know who the fuck I'm

70
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:50,880
talking about.
Right for keep putting Chapman,

71
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,550
Julie,
she's overusing or what is he doing?

72
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:57,230
It's like, dude, they've played
three elimination games in a row.

73
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,940
You got to use the guy.

74
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,340
Don't you think he brought
a middle too early?

75
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:06,140
I love when people say that they haven't
even coached a little league fucking

76
00:04:06,141 --> 00:04:09,290
team to a victory yet. And they're
questioning what a major league.

77
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,710
I mean I guess she can question it but,
and it's always like,

78
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:15,230
well the guy who I would
have put in who didn't go in,

79
00:04:15,231 --> 00:04:18,080
so you have no idea what would have
would have happened if you put him in.

80
00:04:18,081 --> 00:04:21,470
I'm going to hypothetically say that we
then would have won the fucking game or

81
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,300
it would have gone smoother.
So I look smarter.

82
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:27,650
They had to put that guy in there and um,
what was,

83
00:04:27,651 --> 00:04:31,370
what was the big problem you put the
fucking guy in instead of throwing 105 he

84
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:35,810
was throwing 98 I mean, well what are
you going to do? You had to do it.

85
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,050
Cubs go up.
I can't remember what the fuck happened.

86
00:04:39,051 --> 00:04:43,190
There was so many goddamn
twists and turns. What was
it? It was like five to one

87
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,310
then like a wild pitch or whatever
and fucking lie had cheese.

88
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,740
Do you want to see the funniest fucking,
if you want to see the funniest, like,

89
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:56,560
like run a tweets. Go look at Jason
Law heads, Twitter, that fucking guy,

90
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,830
he quit in the fifth inning.

91
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:02,840
You know I was just going to wait to
the pitchers and catchers report, right?

92
00:05:02,841 --> 00:05:07,310
And then fucking two seconds later,
wild pitch. It's five to fucking tree.

93
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,300
It's still a game. Oh, I
never saw a guy. He just what?

94
00:05:12,301 --> 00:05:16,730
He was packing it in, packing
it in back in it in. Um,

95
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:20,090
and you said he wasn't gonna tweet
anymore until the catchers and pitchers

96
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:24,740
reported and then all of a sudden
they fucking tie it up. That home run.

97
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,300
Who the fuck can I got
to get his name right?

98
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,700
The way it's Cleveland step
stepchild Davis, right. Was that,

99
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,330
oh it was the left fielder.
Holy Shit.

100
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,870
And I gotta tell you something right now.
I flip flopped so many times.

101
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:40,850
Who the fuck I wanted to see when I
initially I was with Cleveland cause

102
00:05:40,851 --> 00:05:42,170
everybody wanted the cubs fans.

103
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,980
I saw that 30 for 30 with Bartman and
I was just like, you know these guys,

104
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,670
they're not the fucking a salt of the
earth people that they try to make him out

105
00:05:49,671 --> 00:05:53,300
to be the happy go lucky, take your
shirt off. Maybe we will. Maybe we lose.

106
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,650
As long as we enjoy the America's pastime.
These aren't who these are.

107
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:02,300
They're just like me. Every red sox,
every Yankees, that'd be Philly Fan.

108
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:05,480
I actually argued with the a Yankee fan
today. He was going like, fuck the Kobes,

109
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,330
let Steve Bartman Shit.
They ruined that kid's life.

110
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,280
That wouldn't have happened in New
York. I was like, get the fuck out of,

111
00:06:11,281 --> 00:06:13,580
you know when that happened in New York,
what happened in New York,

112
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,750
it would have happened in Boston. But you
know what, in fairness to cubs fan base,

113
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:20,900
what that really was was the morning,
you know, the shock jock guys.

114
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:26,470
And what they did was they stirred
up the lower 10% 15% of people,

115
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:29,030
you know,
as pissed as I would be or whatever.

116
00:06:29,031 --> 00:06:33,140
There's no fucking way would you really
get on a phone and start making depth,

117
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:33,861
death threats?

118
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:38,030
I mean really think about the level of
mouth breathing more on that you would

119
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:42,380
have to be to take it to that level.
Um, so I, I don't so whatever.

120
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:46,160
So initially that's kind of, I was, I'm
a contrary and everyone's for the cubs.

121
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:48,620
So I was rooting for the fucking Indians.
And then what happens?

122
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:51,590
They went up three games to one and
I'm texting with a couple of my Indian

123
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:54,530
buddies and one of them had cheat.
She's just so fucking like,

124
00:06:54,531 --> 00:06:58,790
we know when they will in a game four.
And it was like, you know, I don't know,

125
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:01,400
nine to something. And he was
going through it. I, I hope,

126
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:04,460
I hope it goes all the way up to
like fucking, I always go 19 runs.

127
00:07:04,461 --> 00:07:07,850
I hope they run out of pitchers.
And immediately I was thinking like,

128
00:07:07,851 --> 00:07:12,080
Jesus Christ, how quickly the suffering
forget. Why would you wish that on them?

129
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:16,280
You just want to win. Right. And then
he was going like, now we've got Lebron.

130
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:18,440
This is just the beginning.
We're going to go on a run,

131
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,180
like they were going to stick and
somebody tweeted or texted Cleveland title

132
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:27,380
town after two fucking titles.
You don't even have a fucking hockey team.

133
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:33,290
And you end up in the brown and studying.
You lost your fucking team.

134
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,930
You know the city treated him so shitty.

135
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,740
They thought Baltimore was a
better fucking option. All right,

136
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,800
you're far from fucking.
So then they started bugging me.

137
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,660
I'm just a contrarion cunt.

138
00:07:44,661 --> 00:07:47,380
I didn't have a dog in the fight
and I was happy that one fee.

139
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:51,260
Be honest with you. I was happy for
Cleveland or Chicago, that one teams, uh,

140
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:56,030
misery was going to end. Right. So at that
point then I was like, well fuck this.

141
00:07:56,031 --> 00:07:59,350
I'm going to root for the cubs. Right. I
got a couple of relatives that cubs fans.

142
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,430
I got to say I fucking, you know,
I'll, I'll go with this shit.

143
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:04,790
Then I was kind of like gap. I like
the Indians van. Like I like Cleveland,

144
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,240
you know, Cleveland needs a fucking
hand. Do that downtown area.

145
00:08:08,241 --> 00:08:11,660
It's gradually coming back. Every
time I come there, it looks better.

146
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,840
I love the Midwest. Well Chicago's
Midwest too, but I don't know,

147
00:08:14,841 --> 00:08:17,750
that's kind of like the New
York City or the Midwest. Um,

148
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,450
tremendously underrated cities still.
But anyways,

149
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,660
so it's still kind of hanging
in there for him. And uh,

150
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:28,880
you know what the final tipping point
was when Mike Friends Saska trashed the

151
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:30,980
fucking cubs for showing
Bill Murray Goldman.

152
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,720
What do you know the whole deal
Marijo he talk thing, you know,

153
00:08:35,721 --> 00:08:37,760
it didn't work for me.
Mike Francisco,

154
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:41,500
who gives a fuck what works
for you and what doesn't?

155
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:46,130
Your team's not in the playoff.
All right, you're a non factor.

156
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,690
Your team's a nonfactor it the funniest
fucking thing, man. At the Yankee fans,

157
00:08:50,691 --> 00:08:55,350
they cannot handle the fact that other
people are winning championships and a

158
00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:56,250
good fucking time.

159
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,370
And that sort of the unwritten rule
because whenever the Yankees won a world

160
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:04,110
series, which God knows is quite a bit
like ESPN there, their stock line is,

161
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:07,860
they'll go in all is right in the
baseball world again. It's like,

162
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,520
aren't you guys supposed to pretend
that you're kind of rooting for any,

163
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:16,200
you're not really rooting
for anybody. Um, so anyways,

164
00:09:16,201 --> 00:09:17,850
fuck Mike Francessa my Francesco,

165
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,910
he's one of those fucking guys who doesn't
realize that he's just as stupid as I

166
00:09:20,911 --> 00:09:23,250
am. He's one of those guys
where he's just been doing,

167
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,650
it's so fucking long that he really,

168
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,740
he forgets that he's just commenting
on shit that doesn't matter dude.

169
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,480
You talking about a baseball game?
Okay.

170
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:37,020
All the shit that has happened even
in New York, fucking New York City,

171
00:09:37,021 --> 00:09:38,460
all this shit that's
fucking happened there.

172
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,570
The cataclysmic world events that
have happened there and the level of

173
00:09:42,571 --> 00:09:45,300
seriousness that that guy takes himself.
Oh,

174
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:47,820
with his stethoscope fucking headphones.
That guy,

175
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:49,950
he drives me up the fuck I
have never been more happy.

176
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,990
The full fucking mad dog when
he got the fuck out of there.

177
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,080
Jesus Christ to be looking
across from that pompous ass.

178
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,730
Is there anything worse than the box
seats fucking sports fan that is just so

179
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:04,050
fucking impressed with themselves and
their dumb sweaters and shit? I Dunno.

180
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,030
You give them a little more fancy a seat,
and I'm telling you it's,

181
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:10,890
it's like the space shuttle for their
ego and they just go right up over here.

182
00:10:10,891 --> 00:10:13,620
The daffy duck thing didn't
work for me. Oh God. Well maybe,

183
00:10:13,621 --> 00:10:15,630
maybe the cubs out of fucking,
you know,

184
00:10:15,631 --> 00:10:20,550
rethink their relationship
with Bill Murray. Hey Mike,

185
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,560
are you the fucking Bill Murray of,
of,

186
00:10:23,561 --> 00:10:27,690
of sports broadcasters fucking off.

187
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,960
He's just another guy who watches
sports that never gets on the treadmill.

188
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,930
I don't understand. How can you look at
all those guys in that level of shape?

189
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,080
And when you're at the end of the game,
when you go into brush your teeth,

190
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,420
you don't look at yourself
like Jesus Christ.

191
00:10:39,421 --> 00:10:43,320
Can I at least need a fucking salad every
once in awhile? Oh, this feels great.

192
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:47,340
This feels great to totally overreact
to what he said. It's a fun thing.

193
00:10:47,341 --> 00:10:52,110
So anyways, um, congratulations
to the Chicago cubs.

194
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,910
You got the fucking goat off your back.

195
00:10:53,911 --> 00:10:56,790
Whatever the fuck you want to call
it was the dumbest curse ever. Okay?

196
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:00,720
You can't bring livestock to a
baseball game. All right? You know,

197
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:04,290
what you really did is you did not have
a curse the same way the red sox didn't

198
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:04,830
have a curse.

199
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:09,830
What it really was was you were fans of
an unbelievably inept franchise for a

200
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:14,730
long fucking time. And
uh, thank God, you know,

201
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,090
we finally got Theo Epstein,
we finally got Terry Francona,

202
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:21,990
we finally got the ownership that the
red sox have and it all came together and

203
00:11:21,991 --> 00:11:26,550
we finally did what teams
like the fucking Yankees,

204
00:11:26,551 --> 00:11:30,120
the cardinals, the Patriots, teams like
that, that know how to fucking win.

205
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,150
I actually can't say the Patriots.
That's even modern modern era.

206
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:38,070
The Celtics back in the day, um, you know,
as much as I hate the fucking Yankees,

207
00:11:38,071 --> 00:11:41,100
like their, their, their front office,
their ownership, their franchise,

208
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:44,740
their farm system, it's a
shit is the shit. I mean,

209
00:11:44,741 --> 00:11:47,580
you can't get mad at them for starting
around network for being smart enough to

210
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,290
do that. I don't, I don't want
to hit on any of that shit.

211
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:52,790
But that whole fucking thing where
all is right, if, if they went is,

212
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,570
that's a little, it goes a little beyond.
But other than that, I don't put grudge.

213
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,360
They fucking 27 championships. I
really dumb. Um, having said that, uh,

214
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,000
we finally got the right people in place.

215
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:08,320
So you finally got the right people
in place and having said that, um,

216
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,240
whoever was going to win last night,

217
00:12:10,241 --> 00:12:15,241
the cubs or the Indians was an automatic
one way fucking a ticket for either

218
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:22,390
Theo Epstein or Terry Francona
into, uh, into the hall of fame.

219
00:12:22,391 --> 00:12:26,560
So congratulations to Theo
Epstein. Um, without a doubt.

220
00:12:26,561 --> 00:12:29,620
I mean that guy ended the curse of the
baby and the curse of the goat. I mean,

221
00:12:29,621 --> 00:12:34,600
he needs a nickname at this
point, something right. I
can't think of it right now,

222
00:12:34,601 --> 00:12:39,040
but I'm just saying that guy at 86,
[inaudible] 86 and 108,

223
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:43,570
that's 186 and the 194 years of suffering,
that fucking guy just ended.

224
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,880
You know, it's like a champ too. You
see the guy who's in his forties,

225
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,650
he still looks like he used
to be an astronaut. I mean,

226
00:12:50,651 --> 00:12:52,630
the guy's just crushing it
and somebody fucking levels.

227
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:57,130
You can really see how people would try
to root against them and um, whatever,

228
00:12:57,131 --> 00:12:59,590
man, the Indians will definitely be
back. I gotta be honest with you,

229
00:12:59,591 --> 00:13:02,170
I'm still more of an Indians
fan than I am a cubs fan,

230
00:13:02,171 --> 00:13:05,530
but it was so fucking great,
like seeing the look of joy on,

231
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,450
on a bill Murray's face.
And by the way, uh,

232
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:13,480
what Francisco like did you not
enjoy seeing that? Watching him?

233
00:13:13,481 --> 00:13:17,830
She's fucking lead. However old he
is, was all just fucking coming out.

234
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:22,630
It was tremendous. So, um, it was
great. It was what a fucking gay man,

235
00:13:22,631 --> 00:13:23,800
Jesus Christ,
where to go.

236
00:13:23,801 --> 00:13:27,280
And then I forgot the fucking rain
delay and then they tie it up,

237
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:32,680
they fucking tie it up. And I was
like, oh my God, this is on. It's,

238
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:36,490
it's gonna reverse again.
Like the way everyone's, like,

239
00:13:36,491 --> 00:13:38,530
everyone just kind of thought
the cubs are gonna win it.

240
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,930
And then the Indians go up three
games to one. They're like, oh my God,

241
00:13:40,931 --> 00:13:41,681
the Indians are going to win it.

242
00:13:41,681 --> 00:13:44,050
Then reverse then looks like
the cubs are gonna win it.

243
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:47,170
And then the Indians tied fucking
back up again. You're like, fuck,

244
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,410
I know I'm getting hyped
up here, but dude, when,

245
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,400
when does baseball get this
fucking exciting? Right?

246
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:55,300
And then it starts fucking raining
and they bring out the fucking tarp.

247
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,250
That's the funniest shit. And that's
one of the great, that's like this.

248
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:02,880
The sport within the sport of baseball
is the fucking rain delay. And uh,

249
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:03,761
they got to put a book.

250
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:08,530
If there's never been a book put out
yet about people just talking about what

251
00:14:08,531 --> 00:14:11,530
goes through your head as you're going
through a fucking rain delay and you have

252
00:14:11,531 --> 00:14:15,910
to sit there and fill up three hours
of fucking broadcast time telling your

253
00:14:15,911 --> 00:14:19,040
stories. I mean, that's when you
got to hope that you got like a, uh,

254
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,760
a Pete rose there.
You know what I mean?

255
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,970
You got to have some guy with a zillion
fucking stories that knows how to tell a

256
00:14:24,971 --> 00:14:28,870
story, um, to how great was
he? He was fucking phenomenal.

257
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,410
A rod was great. The big
herd, all of those guys,

258
00:14:32,411 --> 00:14:36,520
when you got like hall of
famers sitting there, you know,

259
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:40,000
just the way they break down,
but nobody breaks it down like Pete Rose,

260
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:43,810
Jesus Christ, you know all the
games that, that guys played,

261
00:14:43,811 --> 00:14:47,020
all the experiences he's had.
And then you combine gambling on it.

262
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,770
So he took it to a whole other level
of the way he looks at numbers.

263
00:14:50,771 --> 00:14:54,530
I mean guy is like second
to none with his analysis.

264
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:00,920
By the way, Jason Heyward, huge fan,

265
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,360
that fucking catchy made,

266
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,470
I forget what game where he leapt up and
then had to reach back and then when he

267
00:15:06,471 --> 00:15:07,304
fired the,

268
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,960
the through that strike like Dave
Parker in the all star game grant,

269
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:14,780
Dave through it from the warning track
to the home plate when he threw it in a

270
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:18,710
second to get that guy out kill
the fucking momentum is great.

271
00:15:18,711 --> 00:15:23,540
As that was the worst at bat of the
fucking of this series was his one of his

272
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:28,670
last at bats to, did you see the two
pitches he fucking swung at? I mean,

273
00:15:28,671 --> 00:15:33,380
Jesus Christ, 50 cent could've
struck him out at that bad.

274
00:15:33,381 --> 00:15:35,820
I mean it was, it was like,
you know, they just stayed,

275
00:15:35,821 --> 00:15:39,620
take some fucking guy like 50 cent
out of the crowd and they, oh my God,

276
00:15:39,621 --> 00:15:43,100
it's 50 cent and he just goes out and
throws the ball. You're like, oh my God,

277
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:47,960
he really is an artist. Um, you
got to look that up by the way.

278
00:15:47,961 --> 00:15:50,570
I think I tweeted when he did that, I
said, 50 cent didn't throw that ball.

279
00:15:50,571 --> 00:15:55,190
Curtis Jackson did you have to see
it man. It's just like, it was a,

280
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,220
I dunno, it was like watching Jon
Lester trying to throw to first base,

281
00:15:58,221 --> 00:16:02,690
which I had no idea that he, he
won't even do it. I'm nuts. Is that,

282
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:07,200
that's like a,
it was like chop Nog Chuck Knoblauch,

283
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:11,090
Steve Sax Times fucking to at
least one of the videos that I saw.

284
00:16:11,091 --> 00:16:16,010
Thank God that he didn't.
But, um, anyways, um,

285
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,590
my condolences to the city of
Cleveland, man, I, I really,

286
00:16:18,591 --> 00:16:21,200
I love that city and a municipal stadium.

287
00:16:21,201 --> 00:16:24,560
I'll let shit back in the day that
I grew up watching. Like I said,

288
00:16:24,561 --> 00:16:27,740
one of my relatives lived out there when
I was a kid and he kind of would always

289
00:16:27,741 --> 00:16:30,680
be rooting for them and you know,
he was cool.

290
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,010
So I would fucking route for them to
a buddy, of course, red sox first.

291
00:16:34,011 --> 00:16:35,540
So I always kind of had
that thing with them.

292
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:38,270
And the Tigers that kind of
like the surrogates if the, uh,

293
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,820
the red sox aren't in it.
Um,

294
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:44,300
and I also liked the
royals and I like the A's.

295
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:48,950
I Dunno. I like the pirates.
I like the cardinals.

296
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:53,690
I like the giants and I liked the
Dodgers back in the day. So I, I,

297
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,340
there's a lot of teams that
I fucking thing, you know,

298
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:59,720
they all take a deep second to fucking,
the red sox aren't in it,

299
00:16:59,721 --> 00:17:02,150
you know what I mean?
So anyways,

300
00:17:02,151 --> 00:17:06,410
I even rooted for the Yankees in 2001
after nine 11 I was like, all right,

301
00:17:06,411 --> 00:17:09,440
fuck it. I gotta set this shit aside and
then the fucking Diamondbacks beat him.

302
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,250
I was like, fuck, I should've been
rude for these guys the whole time.

303
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:18,080
I wouldn't jinxed him. So anyways,
congratulations. Um, and Cleveland. Amen.

304
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:18,950
Your next,

305
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:22,550
or I guess I should be rooting for the
Arizona cardinals cause they have the

306
00:17:22,551 --> 00:17:23,870
longest drought,

307
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:28,900
I guess with the championship since 1947
when they were the Chicago cardinals.

308
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,930
Um, and then they went
to, uh, I don't know.

309
00:17:32,931 --> 00:17:34,790
I can't remember what the
fucking lineage of that team is,

310
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:38,030
but like I don't give a fuck about them
because they've lived in so many fucking

311
00:17:38,031 --> 00:17:42,890
cities. Like the city doesn't carry
the pain. Does that make sense?

312
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:45,710
Middle of Arizona cardinals right now.
Uh,

313
00:17:45,711 --> 00:17:47,550
I'm surprised it didn't
just pop up on my thing.

314
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,010
You know your computer like
listens to you. I actually

315
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,160
get dead Arizona cardinals, you
have to do that. You just say, yeah,

316
00:17:53,161 --> 00:17:57,720
fucking a pumpernickel bread. Oh,
what's in pumpernickel bread? You right.

317
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,360
You right like p you and then
it says pumpernickel bread.

318
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,660
Like your phone will do that.
Like who,

319
00:18:01,661 --> 00:18:04,320
what the foot of fucking odds
that came up. You listen to me

320
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:09,150
said fucking robot lady on the phone.
She listens.

321
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,770
She listens to Oh yeah, she's listening
to you. Let's see here. Official site now.

322
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,000
It's pretty sad case.

323
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:19,140
You got to go to Wikipedia to find
out that fucking history the quickest.

324
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:22,470
Actually, maybe it isn't. All right,
here we go. The cardinals, let's see.

325
00:18:22,471 --> 00:18:24,750
They were the Chicago cardinals,

326
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:29,070
1920 to 1943 they took a
year off during the war.

327
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,890
1945 to 1959,

328
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:38,570
uh oh they were the cardinals card pit
in 1944 I thought they had the eagles in

329
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:42,990
Pittsburgh and made the struggles.
Anyway. St Louis Cardinals,

330
00:18:42,991 --> 00:18:44,850
1960 to 1987.

331
00:18:44,851 --> 00:18:49,230
Phoenix cardinals 88 to 93 94 to present
Arizona. So they've been all right.

332
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,550
They've been cheated. They've been in
Phoenix for fucking almost 30 years. Wow.

333
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,380
They've been there longer
than they weren't St Louis.

334
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,000
How [inaudible] how about that?

335
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:02,120
And they were in Chicago
basically for 29 years.

336
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,460
Isn't that something? So they weren't
fee Arizona the longest, then Chicago,

337
00:19:07,461 --> 00:19:10,580
then Saint Louis. So anyways, I don't
really count that fucking shit. Let's see,

338
00:19:10,581 --> 00:19:13,520
the longest stretch I can see the next
person I give a fuck about past Cleveland.

339
00:19:13,521 --> 00:19:18,320
Right? Let's see. Longest
sports droughts, bing,

340
00:19:18,321 --> 00:19:22,820
Bang, boom, drought sports. Uh,
longest active droughts in sports.

341
00:19:22,821 --> 00:19:25,640
When was this made? This was
done three hours ago. Okay.

342
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:31,640
So they should be fairly accurate.
Correct. So it goes the Arizona cardinals,

343
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,160
then the Cleveland Indians. Just
give me the fucking list. All right.

344
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:41,090
The Arizona cardinals shut up.
All right.

345
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:45,920
69 years. Cleveland Indians,
68 years. Sacramento,

346
00:19:45,921 --> 00:19:50,300
kings 1951. They will like
to Rochester royals, I think,

347
00:19:50,301 --> 00:19:54,550
or some shit like that. Uh, they
haven't won in 65 years to Troy lions.

348
00:19:54,551 --> 00:19:56,660
Seven one since 1957.

349
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:01,040
The Atlanta Hawks when they were
the Saint Louis Hawks, 1958,

350
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:07,130
uh, then the Philadelphia
Eagles, 1960, um,

351
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,900
Texas rangers. Never. 1955.
Never won a championship.

352
00:20:11,901 --> 00:20:14,090
Tennessee titans,
they used to be the Houston Oilers.

353
00:20:14,091 --> 00:20:18,770
They want an AFL title in 1961. So
a couple more here. Houston Astros,

354
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:23,510
never 54 fucking years.
Um,

355
00:20:23,511 --> 00:20:27,560
San Diego chargers,
1963 53 years since their AFL title,

356
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:32,500
and then the Toronto Maple leafs. So if
we're going to go sport by sport, uh,

357
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,440
the longest drought and football
is the Arizona cardinals baseball,

358
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:36,531
the Cleveland Indians.

359
00:20:36,531 --> 00:20:41,531
Basketball is the Sacramento Kings
in hockey is the Toronto Maple leafs.

360
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:46,640
There you go. 69 years, 68, 65 at 49.

361
00:20:46,641 --> 00:20:47,830
So there you Toronto

362
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:52,930
Shit. These other guys, they got,
they got fucking 20 years on you. Um,

363
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:56,760
and actually nowadays when there's that
many fucking teams going to get 32 teams

364
00:20:56,761 --> 00:21:01,590
to go 50 years, considering one of them's
going to, you know, when a couple, two,

365
00:21:01,591 --> 00:21:06,420
three, if not four or five over 30 years.
Right. It's very easy now to go 40 years.

366
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,520
All right. Tell I think we've had
enough of the sports talk. All right,

367
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:15,880
well maybe I have to, let's talk
about flat top grills, shall we,

368
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:19,930
by the way, I have not called La head
yet. I'm going to wait three days.

369
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:25,130
I'm going to rub, run into them. I'm
going to give him a hug. You know,

370
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,550
tell him, you know, you
still got the NBA title.

371
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,870
You got a little hyped up there.
Oh my God.

372
00:21:32,871 --> 00:21:36,690
The agony j law.
He remember that the agony of defeat.

373
00:21:36,691 --> 00:21:39,300
Do you remember when the ski jump
Guy went off the fucking ski jump?

374
00:21:39,301 --> 00:21:43,200
If you look at j law heads, Twitter
feed, dude, it's fucking hard. Delirious

375
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,870
because if he's not joking,
he's literally,

376
00:21:46,871 --> 00:21:50,980
he goes off to ski jump like
five times every game. You know,

377
00:21:50,981 --> 00:21:53,950
when any just lay in face down.
He like, is he dead? Is he dead?

378
00:21:53,951 --> 00:21:57,610
And then he somehow pops his head up,
shakes his hair out,

379
00:21:57,611 --> 00:22:01,630
he puts the fucking goggles back on and
he fucking gradually walks back up the

380
00:22:01,631 --> 00:22:02,464
stairs again.

381
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:06,290
Okay.

382
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:08,240
Yeah. I'm telling you, man,
it's, it's really entertaining.

383
00:22:08,241 --> 00:22:10,040
Anytime there's a big Cleveland game,

384
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:14,380
I recommend following j
law had Jason Lie ahead on,

385
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:20,110
um, on Twitter. You know, just sit
back and just watch the floods.

386
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:23,030
It's tremendous. It's, it's
an amazing thing. It's,

387
00:22:23,031 --> 00:22:26,740
it's a great sportsbook every fuck. And
just, just in tweets. It's incredible.

388
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,630
All right. So anyways, let's talk
about a flat top grill. Everybody. Oh,

389
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,260
I want to get a flat top grill. Um,
I told you a few weeks ago when, um,

390
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:39,280
John Fabrice, you know, was shooting
some stuff that possibly, I don't know,

391
00:22:39,281 --> 00:22:43,390
he might do some footage
with, uh, you know,

392
00:22:43,391 --> 00:22:44,780
cooking Edison place.

393
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,800
I went over to the taping mean the lovely
Nia and we got to hang out with, uh,

394
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:52,930
chef Roy Choi who started the
whole gourmet food truck thing. A,

395
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,160
they cooked on a grill,
which is something I never did.

396
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,280
Even when I worked in a restaurant. I, I
cooked on a mesquite grill. I did Burgers,

397
00:22:58,281 --> 00:23:02,120
shrimp, brochette, chicken sandwich,
whatever the fuck you want. Right? Uh,

398
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:06,960
but I never worked with uh, on a, on
a griddle before and now, uh, I am,

399
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,810
I am so fucking into those things.
It's ridiculous.

400
00:23:09,811 --> 00:23:13,230
And I found this one on the Internet.
I'm not going to tell you the name of it,

401
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:16,770
just look up flat top fucking grill.
There's too,

402
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:20,220
it's not the Blackstone one.
This is like a smaller one.

403
00:23:20,221 --> 00:23:23,520
It's more compact for
my little La Backyard.

404
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:26,520
And I'm trying to convince my wife
to let me get it, man. You know,

405
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:30,600
cause we're re we're redoing the kitchen
and so we went to go do the stove,

406
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,660
like the one that had the little griddle
on it was just going to take up too

407
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,560
much counter space.

408
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:39,540
We have a small kitchen area
and the number one thing
was I hated the those like

409
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:43,470
no prep area in the kitchen and I hate,
I hated the island.

410
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:47,480
Have ever told you guys that how much
I hate a fucking island in the kitchen.

411
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,620
I F I don't think, I didn't care if it
could fit in my kitchen. He couldn't fit.

412
00:23:51,621 --> 00:23:55,070
They just put an island in there because
it was like the fucking thing to do and

413
00:23:55,071 --> 00:23:58,550
you just want, it's like having a
fucking hippo that passed out on booze.

414
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:01,730
And did you just kind of walk around
like the worst fucking thing is whatever

415
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:05,240
you're at the stove and whatever you need
is diagonally across the other side of

416
00:24:05,241 --> 00:24:07,310
the fucking house. You got
to walk all around it. Okay.

417
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:10,130
Now for all my friends around
the world in war torn countries,

418
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,090
this is what she complained about
it in the United States of America,

419
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,990
that Goddamn island in your
fucking brand new kitchen. Right.

420
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,620
Sorry.
But anyways,

421
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:25,850
so we didn't get the griddle and now I'm
already kicking myself and because we

422
00:24:25,851 --> 00:24:27,860
end up going with this stove
as six burners, I'm like,

423
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,790
oh there's two of us were like,
what the fuck do I want?

424
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,750
Even when we have Thanksgiving dinner,

425
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:37,400
I've never had more than three going
at a time. You know what I mean?

426
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:40,070
You have some in the oven,
you've got something else.
And so you've got two sides,

427
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:44,600
maybe three sites, right?
That's it. You don't need six.

428
00:24:44,601 --> 00:24:47,940
I should have got the fucking griddle.
But then I saw this,

429
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:50,480
this attachment that you can get
that you put the griddle on top,

430
00:24:50,481 --> 00:24:53,780
but it's not the same cause now you kind
of control in the heat with like the

431
00:24:53,781 --> 00:24:57,830
burners. So what I would do is I
put one on simmer, right or low,

432
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:00,140
and then the other one I'd put,
put it up on the cook and eat.

433
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:04,010
So I can do that whole fucking thing
of a moving the food around, you know,

434
00:25:04,011 --> 00:25:07,940
if it's going too fast, if it needs
to chill, if the bread's brown and up,

435
00:25:07,941 --> 00:25:10,370
but the cheese hasn't melted yet.
All that shit that I learned.

436
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,850
If Fabro ever puts that shit
out, dude, I'm telling you man,

437
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,650
I learned more goddamn shit
about cooking just with that,

438
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:23,080
controlling the heat and moving it around
and actually looking at the stuff I

439
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,800
can't even,
I'm beside myself.

440
00:25:24,801 --> 00:25:28,880
I immediately became 15 to
20% better cook than I was,

441
00:25:28,881 --> 00:25:32,290
which isn't hard because
I suck. But um, anyway,

442
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:36,260
so I started watching this guy. You
guys got to check this guy out on, on,

443
00:25:36,261 --> 00:25:37,970
on Youtube.
Um,

444
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,510
he actually promotes the grill
that I wasn't going to get.

445
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,040
It's just a little too big for me,

446
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:47,600
but it's the Blackstone grill
and there's this guy, uh,

447
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,080
what the fuck does he call himself?

448
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,250
He goes by Todd Tovan, T.
O. D. D. T. O. V. E. N.

449
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,970
And m.
What does he call himself,

450
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:05,990
although rocky mountain meet hunter.
All right.

451
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,100
He's on Twitter at rocky mountain,
meet hunter.com.

452
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,860
But you don't need to go to Twitter
unless you want to just tell him you like

453
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:16,030
his videos, but you just watch this
guy fucking Cook, you know? Uh,

454
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:20,140
I know he's hyping all these barbecue
sauces and rubs and all that ship a good

455
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,490
fan.
A man's got to make a living,

456
00:26:21,491 --> 00:26:26,260
but the shit that he makes is
fucking unbelievable and a too,

457
00:26:26,261 --> 00:26:29,230
when you see this griddled there's no
fucking way, just to let you guys know,

458
00:26:29,231 --> 00:26:34,060
they make a smaller one, um, that I'm
thinking about getting, but a dude,

459
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,240
it's fucking ridiculous.
He's making fucking cheese steaks.

460
00:26:37,241 --> 00:26:40,630
He's making case at d is he made
pizza in this other fucking thing.

461
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,810
He's toasting up the bonds. He's
got his onions, peppers going.

462
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,740
He's got elk on the grill.
Whatever the fuck you want.

463
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,550
I actually watched this guy was so
inspired by him and in a frying pan,

464
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:55,260
I took some of that elk that Rogan gave
me and I made late at night. I made a, um,

465
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:58,890
sort of my version of an elk cheese steak.

466
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,160
I had some peppers and onions going in
with a little bit of mushroom. Right.

467
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,910
And then, uh, the meat that he
gave me is more like hamburgers.

468
00:27:05,911 --> 00:27:08,880
So it was more of a consistency of
hamburger. So I couldn't really lay it in.

469
00:27:08,881 --> 00:27:13,640
I had to kind of pour it into the bun, but
I put the, uh, you know, the fucking, uh,

470
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:17,190
uh, the provolone on top.
I don't like the wisdom.

471
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,380
I don't like to waste provolone on top.

472
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:22,650
I could have seasoned the meat a
little bit more of just my salt shaker.

473
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,780
I don't know what it is. I can't
see it coming out. It comes out.

474
00:27:24,781 --> 00:27:28,770
So finally I was tasting it and I didn't
want to oversell it, but I needed to,

475
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:30,960
I probably should put like,
I don't know,

476
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,400
garlic salt or something
like that in there,

477
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:35,640
but a little cheese on top with
the mushrooms and then the peppers.

478
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,770
And then I had the best fucking role ever.

479
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:41,220
And I made this thing like
one in the morning, you know,

480
00:27:41,221 --> 00:27:43,290
I was coming home from doing my
spots and I made it. And you know,

481
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:46,230
Nia sitting there going,
what are you two and it's too late.

482
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:50,970
And then I made the thing, I came walking
in and she was like, what is that? Right.

483
00:27:50,971 --> 00:27:53,760
And I gave her a bite and then of course,
you know she does that fucking shit.

484
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:58,620
I want one. Oh look at what is, oh
she just called and I missed the call.

485
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:04,800
Um, anyways, so I am
crazy in the doing that.

486
00:28:04,801 --> 00:28:09,630
So I'm, I'm thinking about getting that
for the backyard. We'll see. We'll see.

487
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,720
He has already given me, you know,
she, she knows what she's doing.

488
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:15,450
She just sort of, you know, like when you
really excited about getting something,

489
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:18,090
your wife just sort of just,
you know, it was quiet and nods.

490
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,230
That means they don't want you to get
it and they're just waiting for hoping

491
00:28:22,231 --> 00:28:24,630
that your excitement will go
away after a couple of days.

492
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,420
But I do the same thing to her.
What's up buddy?

493
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:31,530
You totally know how to work the angles,
don't you cleo?

494
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,710
Sometimes when she wants something rather
than, than coming over and being crazy.

495
00:28:34,711 --> 00:28:38,520
She just comes over and she just put
her head on my leg and then just sort of

496
00:28:38,521 --> 00:28:43,470
look at me, you know, how do you resist
that Cleo kitchen? Not Thank you. Come on,

497
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:47,880
go lay down. Go lay down. Go
lay down. Go on. All right. Um,

498
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:52,140
maybe read a little bit of
advertising here for the week. Um,

499
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:57,520
oh, audit. Speaking to Joe Rogan,
Joe Rogan's company on it. I'm on.

500
00:28:57,521 --> 00:28:59,020
It has a new product.

501
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:02,800
It's called emulsified MCT oil.

502
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:08,100
Mct Oil is one of the fastest sources of
clean fuel for the body and the brain.

503
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,320
It's one of the best ways to power
up your performance. A kickstart,

504
00:29:11,321 --> 00:29:16,060
a weight management program. There
are lots of MCT oil brands out there,

505
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:20,980
but there's none like emulsified MCT oil
from Onnit available in three delicious

506
00:29:20,981 --> 00:29:24,250
flavors, coconut, Vanilla
and strawberry. As I said,

507
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:29,320
that's all my three flavors.
I got a coconut head,

508
00:29:29,321 --> 00:29:34,321
vanilla skin and strawberry
peach emulsified MCT oil
mixes like a cream easily

509
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:40,840
in your morning. Coffee without the
need for a blender. No mess. No,

510
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:43,600
you can even mix it right into
your favorite foods right now.

511
00:29:43,601 --> 00:29:46,290
If you go to [inaudible] dot
com slash bill you can get on,

512
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:49,450
it's emulsified MCT oil for 12% off.

513
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:54,450
That's o n n I t.com/bill to get
emulsified MCT oil for 12% off.

514
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:58,630
And for any reason, if you don't like
it, they'll give you your money back.

515
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:01,240
No questions asked, no biggie.
You've got nothing to lose.

516
00:30:01,241 --> 00:30:05,290
Go to [inaudible] dot com slash
bill and get on it. All right.

517
00:30:05,291 --> 00:30:09,520
D s l t d genes, Jesus Christ, uh,

518
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:15,190
Delta, Sierra Lima, Tango, Delta genes.

519
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,500
The problem with jeans
is that they're really,

520
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,500
that the really good payers cause
two to $300. Isn't that the truth?

521
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:24,220
Easily in the bargain brands just fall
apart. It look terrible. That's also true.

522
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:28,450
So you either you have no
money, right? Or uh, you know,

523
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:31,150
your ass is hanging out and people
beat the shit out of you. I mean that,

524
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:34,200
those are your two options. You
know, unless you're, you know,

525
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:37,270
you're one of those fucking son's
of a Saudi Arabian prince, right?

526
00:30:37,271 --> 00:30:40,000
And you just rolling barrels oil down
the fucking stairs every morning.

527
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:45,550
Tea stld pronounced distilled. I didn't
know that actually I did, but I forgot.

528
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,900
Has revolutionized the fashion industry
by creating timeless luxury grade denim,

529
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:54,370
so you get genes that would cost you
hundreds of dollars starting at just $65

530
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,940
this was my question. How do they
do it? Let's see how they do it.

531
00:30:57,941 --> 00:31:01,390
By refusing to work with department
stores in retail middlemen,

532
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:05,230
there's no markup, no bullshit, just
great chains at an unbelievable price.

533
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:09,880
Just go to distill.com spelled d, e,
s, t, l, D Delta, Sierra, tango, Lima,

534
00:31:09,881 --> 00:31:13,990
delta.com find the perfect
pair with the perfect fit.

535
00:31:13,991 --> 00:31:16,630
They'll ship them to you for
free and guarantee the fit.

536
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:21,370
Or we'll send you a new pair till they
are perfect or it doesn't say they'll

537
00:31:21,371 --> 00:31:23,800
take it back. They'll just keep shipping.
You Ain't getting your money back.

538
00:31:23,801 --> 00:31:26,110
You're going to get more jeans.
See for yourself.

539
00:31:26,111 --> 00:31:31,060
Why a list celebrities have been spotted
in magazines like vogue and Gq wearing

540
00:31:31,061 --> 00:31:33,310
distilled jeans while
you're fucking paid him too.

541
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:39,190
If you just spot them out back, you know,
making a fucking hotdog without the bun.

542
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:43,150
Of course they got to keep the abs there.
Even c list celebrities like me,

543
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:46,840
I don't like how they made me trash
myself. I will do the trashing of me.

544
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:52,630
I'm a c plus celebrity. I've got a
cartoon on Netflix that makes me see,

545
00:31:52,631 --> 00:31:56,410
plus I got a pair of raw denim and it,
the fit is amazing.

546
00:31:56,411 --> 00:31:58,870
You know what's funny about this?
I have not gotten that yet.

547
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:03,490
You know my fucking producer on the
show he's wearing and he said they're

548
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,690
fucking unbelievable and he wears them
all the time. All right, so I never,

549
00:32:07,691 --> 00:32:10,270
you know, I got too much shit in my
house. So whenever these advertisers say,

550
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,070
we'll send you some stuff,
like I never take it,

551
00:32:12,071 --> 00:32:14,410
but he's wearing them now and he's
been raving about them so much.

552
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:17,950
Now I want to fucking pair. That's how
it works. That's how America works.

553
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:22,180
That's how you defeat isis distilled as
the only place in the u s where you can

554
00:32:22,181 --> 00:32:26,530
get this weight of denim for this price
point. And with the natural indigo. Look,

555
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,950
remember the indigo girls.
I went to the doctor,

556
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,320
I went down on my friend.

557
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:37,390
They're going to fit beautifully
and for last four years,

558
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:43,250
but you don't need to be already or
have a stylist or you pay $100 to look

amazing. Just go to distilled a

All right, Luke crate everybody. Give me,

what's going on and y'all get a crate.

571
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:35,030
Jesus Christ, Luke Crane,
you boxing yourself out.

572
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:37,040
Get Out,

573
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,400
get a fucking loot crate and tell all
your friends about it so there's no envy

and they can all stand around. Hey, I like
you wonder woman outfit. Well thank you.

575
00:33:44,451 --> 00:33:47,420
I like your Flash Gordon fucking wig.

576
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,610
I'm on a quest for epic gear,
housewares and collectibles.

577
00:33:52,611 --> 00:33:54,380
Is that what you want to
do while loot crate has it?

578
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:59,420
Loot crate offers an epic range of pop
culture items for less than $20 a month.

579
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:03,710
Uh, if you're a more of a fan
fanatical, I just want to,

580
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:07,340
if they have wonder woman's fucking
drawers, one of those nerds,

581
00:34:07,341 --> 00:34:09,830
they can put it on their fucking,
they can sleep next to it and you know,

582
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,530
sniffing her and invisible pussy. Well,
she's done a visible issue. Her plane is,

583
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:20,040
it never made any sense.
Um, if you're more of a fan,

584
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,240
but you can still every comedian do that,
but you can still see her.

585
00:34:23,241 --> 00:34:26,930
She should be invisible in it.
But then just for animation purposes,

586
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:30,090
then you'd have to be like,
you know where, where is it?

587
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,520
Would you showing clouds going by?

588
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,830
You know what's funny like this is
probably like a 40 minute argument in the

589
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,830
writer's room at Hannah Barbera, one of
those fucking places a long time ago.

590
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:42,890

600
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:22,040
Sorry. They just ended and then
it went to the next sentence,

601
00:35:22,041 --> 00:35:24,890
but there was a gap there.
A big trouble in little China.

602
00:35:24,891 --> 00:35:27,350
I love that movie and so much more.

All right. Two more. Two more.
Hang in there guys. Hang. Well,

609
00:35:49,551 --> 00:35:50,384
how much time is left me?

610
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:53,450
Go fuck around a little more and then
I'll read the last of these. All right,

611
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:54,410
we'll fuck around a little more.

612
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:55,993
MMM.

613
00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:00,590
All right. What did I want to talk about?
Oh, fucking who's playing this week?

614
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,530
Who's was playing this week
in college football? Anything?

615
00:36:03,531 --> 00:36:07,190
Do I actually have anything else that I
want to talk about other than the fact

616
00:36:07,191 --> 00:36:09,860
that I like making Hash browns snuff.
Oh,

617
00:36:09,861 --> 00:36:12,480
do I tell you guys how much I
enjoy making fucking Hash Brown.

618
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:17,060
Take your breakfast to the next
level with a griddle. Make it some.

619
00:36:17,061 --> 00:36:18,710
Fuck that. You know
something. If you just have,

620
00:36:18,711 --> 00:36:22,220
I just want to shut people the fuck up.
Just make some Hash browns.

621
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,560
Start them off the cheesy ones,

622
00:36:24,561 --> 00:36:28,790
and then you bake them in the oven
and you shot everybody the fuck up.

623
00:36:28,791 --> 00:36:33,020
If you want to shut me the fuck up,
that's basically what you can do. Hey,

624
00:36:33,021 --> 00:36:37,010
shout out to Steve Bartman. Everybody.
Hey Dude, stay in hiding, man. Don't,

625
00:36:37,011 --> 00:36:38,900
don't let those carts draw you back out.
All right.

626
00:36:38,901 --> 00:36:42,410
They had the chance to be friends with
a great person like you. All right?

627
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:46,280
You know they're going to try to ask
you to go to the parade, you know? Oh,

628
00:36:46,281 --> 00:36:49,550
all is forgiven. All
is forgiven. You know,

629
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:53,900
it was just fucking 13 years of health.
Um,

630
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:56,990
do you guys think he goes, do you think
he goes back? I don't think he does.

631
00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:00,290
He said no to 30 for 30 kind of. Seems
like he would just eat, you know,

632
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:01,550
he's a very commendable person.

633
00:37:01,551 --> 00:37:06,410
He was somebody that has
no desire for fame in this
century, which is a, you know,

634
00:37:06,411 --> 00:37:09,890
more than I can say for myself or in
90% of the other people out there.

635
00:37:09,891 --> 00:37:12,860
So God bless them. All right.
Actually, I have one question.

636
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:15,980
I usually don't read questions. On a
Thursday afternoon podcasts. I'm like,

637
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:21,830
Tom Steele, Yo Billy ginger tits.
Yes, I did enjoy the two hour podcast,

638
00:37:21,831 --> 00:37:23,120
but you're wrong about one thing.

639
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:27,170
It's not illegal for women to show their
titties or even go topless in most of

640
00:37:27,171 --> 00:37:29,630
the United States. I
didn't know that. In fact,

641
00:37:29,631 --> 00:37:34,490
33 states have laws specifically
allowing it. However, certain towns,

642
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,031
cities,

643
00:37:35,031 --> 00:37:40,031
and municipal areas within each of these
states prohibits to practice a sighting

644
00:37:40,821 --> 00:37:43,100
disturbing the peace as a misdemeanor,

645
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,970
as interpreted by law enforcement
sometimes incorrectly.

646
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:53,810
Uh, if you're digging it, okay, I,
this is the deal dude. Like I guess,

647
00:37:53,811 --> 00:37:55,550
you know, in Africa and some
of these other countries,

648
00:37:55,551 --> 00:37:56,990
they walk around with their titties out.

649
00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:00,380
I guess people don't give a shit about it.
It's like not a big deal.

650
00:38:00,381 --> 00:38:02,840
They get used to it like seeing
a woman's legs or whatever.

651
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,020
If women want to do this shit, I
have come full circle. Fuck it.

652
00:38:06,021 --> 00:38:08,000
You want to walk around with
the Goddamn titties out?

653
00:38:08,001 --> 00:38:10,190
I don't know why you'd want to,
I gotta be honest with you.

654
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:12,920
Most men should not be walking around
with his shirt off like they should be a

655
00:38:12,921 --> 00:38:16,820
rule. Okay. You want to have your
shirt off. Either you're at the beach,

656
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:20,840
you're in your own backyard or you're
working on a chain gang fucking digging a

657
00:38:20,841 --> 00:38:22,370
trench in the side of the road.
Okay.

658
00:38:22,371 --> 00:38:25,150
If you're actually working for a fucking
live and you want to take your goddamn

659
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:29,660
shirt off and risk skin cancer, by
all means do it. Okay. Believe me,

660
00:38:29,661 --> 00:38:31,220
there's a lot of guys with
their shirts out there.

661
00:38:31,221 --> 00:38:36,040
They got bigger tits that most of the
women out there. So um, I just think

662
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,410
it's a funny thing that like,

663
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:43,310
I just don't understand why women would
just like, why can't we do it? They just,

664
00:38:43,311 --> 00:38:43,570
they,

665
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:47,180
they just have that fee maybe cause it's
a position they are in society the way

666
00:38:47,181 --> 00:38:52,181
men kept them down for so fucking long
that every last fucking thing that we do,

667
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:56,180
they want to do regardless
of how fucking stupid it is.

668
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:58,503
You know what I mean?

669
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:01,680
Who the fuck wants to walk
around with his shirt off?

670
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:03,870
Yeah.

671
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:07,230
Matthew mcconaughey, people like
that. People in like p 90 x shape,

672
00:39:07,231 --> 00:39:09,990
like walking around with that this year
and which makes sense. You did the work.

673
00:39:09,991 --> 00:39:13,890
God bless you. I've never had a desire
to walk around with my fucking shirt off.

674
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:18,180
Yeah,

675
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:21,060
yeah. Why would you be half?
Especially past a certain age,

676
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,730
you got to start covering
up 48 fucking years old.

677
00:39:25,731 --> 00:39:29,270
You don't want to see a half naked
anything. There's a few out there.

678
00:39:29,271 --> 00:39:31,760
Madonna kept herself in great shape.
You know what I mean?

679
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,990
There's a few people out there. They,
they've kept themselves, you know,

680
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:39,550
and in phenomenal shape,
they can take their fucking shirts up.

681
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:44,000
But for the most part, most people by 23,
24, by all means, man, a man, a woman,

682
00:39:44,001 --> 00:39:48,100
keep the fucking shirt on. I Dunno.
That's just one of those things.

683
00:39:48,101 --> 00:39:49,030
I don't know what they mean.

684
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:52,030
It's like listening to somebody complain
about the island in their kitchen.

685
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:56,020
It's just like, don't you have
anything better to focus on? All right.

686
00:39:56,021 --> 00:39:59,740
The hypocrite continues.
Um, so I guess, uh,

687
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:04,330
see claiming equal topless rights for men
and women go topless is something here.

688
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:10,120
Uh, go topless claims that women
have the same constitutional right,

689
00:40:10,121 --> 00:40:13,540
that men have to go bare
chested and public. Uh,

690
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:16,720
I really disagree with
that to try to say like,

691
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,520
our titties are the same as your titties.

692
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:21,610
My titties can't get me around a drinks,
you know what I mean?

693
00:40:21,611 --> 00:40:26,380
If I show half a fucking man peck
hair that doesn't get me anything.

694
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:30,880
Or maybe I'm just in the wrong bars, maybe
I need to go into a gay bar there too.

695
00:40:30,881 --> 00:40:35,440
That's a great youtube video.
Go into a gay bar and dress like a man or,

696
00:40:35,441 --> 00:40:37,270
and see how long you can drink for free.

697
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:46,040
That would be fucking hilarious. Near the
end of the night, the guys like, hey man,

698
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,560
do you want to get out of
here and be like, yeah,

699
00:40:47,561 --> 00:40:49,180
but I'm not going on with you and be like,
dude,

700
00:40:49,181 --> 00:40:53,520
what the fuck bought Shell is drinks?
We like, yeah, well I'm straight. Well,

701
00:40:53,521 --> 00:40:56,220
what the fuck are you doing here? I
just want, I wanted to drink for free.

702
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:57,720
Yeah.

703
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,870
Then he goes to swing at
you just go, no. Right?

704
00:41:00,871 --> 00:41:05,871
You get out of their drinking a
bunch of Budweiser's simply safe.

705
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,890
It's crazy what engineers are
coming up with these days.

706
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:15,380
The engineer invented the simply safe
home security system was attending Harvard

707
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:18,170
University. When his friends got
robbed, he wanted to help them out.

708
00:41:18,171 --> 00:41:20,300
So they started shopping
around for home security.

709
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,270
But all the security companies
at the time were just awful.

710
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:24,620
They'd sell these clunky,

711
00:41:24,621 --> 00:41:28,530
expensive systems that required all
sorts of drilling to install. And again,

712
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:32,840
I'm yet to sign a huge longterm
contract. That's what I did. So this guy,

713
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:36,230
simply safe to try and fix all the
problems with the security industry.

714
00:41:36,231 --> 00:41:40,130
Simply safe has wireless.
There's no drilling.

715
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:42,560
I did all of this to my house.

716
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:46,280
You don't have to put a bunch of holes
in your walls to keep your family safe.

717
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,480
God dammit.

718
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:49,880
Okay.

719
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,350
This is why. Why buy anything?
Because then they always come up, oh,

720
00:41:52,351 --> 00:41:56,870
just hovers in the fucking air.
Anyway. Simply safe is wireless.

721
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:02,150
All right? Um, there is no
longterm contract. You don't
have to pay for something.

722
00:42:02,151 --> 00:42:05,870
You're not using 24 seven monitoring.
It's just 1499 a month.

723
00:42:05,871 --> 00:42:10,340
That's three times less than other
security companies. Fucking cock suckers.

Yeah. Jesus. Well, what do I feel like?

731
00:42:30,891 --> 00:42:34,830
Everything in my house is
the technological equipment
of a fucking laserdisc

732
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:38,630
player. I'm going to look into those
guys and see what the fucking deal is.

733
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:40,490
All right. [inaudible] everybody.
This is the last thing.

734
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:45,491
Buying tickets online for
sports and concerts has been
a confusing process for a

735
00:42:45,711 --> 00:42:47,150
long,
long time.

736
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:51,890
It's always been hard to find the best
deal for that game or show you want to go

737
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:56,600
to and none of those older tickets sites
want to charge that. Change that. Sorry,

738
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:57,980
but SeatGeek is different.

Congratulations to you too.

755
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:05,540
And the bandwagons, um, Micah
Dolan's is to Cleveland fans.

756
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,540
You didn't get the calves this year.
Uh, you do have Terry Francona.

757
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:12,890
You've got great players in,
uh, yeah, I mean, I dunno,

758
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:16,850
we won one with Manny Ramirez
and everybody else to so
many, like the Phillies,

759
00:44:16,851 --> 00:44:18,590
Yankee fans,
red sox fans.

760
00:44:18,591 --> 00:44:22,580
All should've been rooting for Cleveland
because we all used your fucking CCS.

761
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:24,763
Your Manny Ramirez, you, Jim told me he's,

762
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:28,130
we all use those guys to get
our championships. And uh,

763
00:44:28,131 --> 00:44:30,770
also that pitcher who fucking pitch for
everybody to forget his fucking name

764
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:32,220
wasn't curt Floyd.

765
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:36,420
Was it clear? Was it, can I get
a whole lot of you before we go?

766
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:39,120
That's kind of the sign off now.

00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:32,400
[inaudible]

777
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,250
I think especially when we get out
of it. Alright, go fuck yourselves.

778
00:45:35,251 --> 00:45:38,010
Congratulations to the
cubs. My consultants as the
Cleveland Indians at all.

779
00:45:38,011 --> 00:45:40,620
I'll see you on Monday. Have a
great weekend. You can listen to.

780
00:45:40,621 --> 00:45:44,070
These are greatest sets
after this music of juices.

781
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:55,420
When we say

782
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:32,180
[inaudible], Hey, what's going
on? It's still, but it is

783
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:34,610
Monday morning podcasts for Monday,

784
00:46:34,611 --> 00:46:39,440
October 27 2008 and the Year
of our Lord Jesus Christ.

785
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:46,550
What is this? The year four,
are you Catholic? What do we do?

786
00:46:46,551 --> 00:46:48,740
I know that the Chinese people,
he always got, you know,

787
00:46:48,741 --> 00:46:52,170
the year of the Yak and why is it?

788
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:55,640
That's always my default animal
yak is just funny. I'm sorry,

789
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:58,610
I didn't know what the fuck it is.
What is a Yak?

790
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:01,100
That's your homework for this week.
If you're a regular listener,

791
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:04,760
let me know what a Yak is and what,
where are they indigenous to?

792
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:08,660
Okay, I'm going to go out on a
limb and I'm going to say, uh,

793
00:47:08,661 --> 00:47:09,740
I'm going to say Scotland.

794
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:13,910
I don't think there's any JAKKS over
here at the Rye JAKKS over here.

795
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:18,140
They were brought here against their will.
Much like those people from Africa.

796
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:23,120
And, you know, I think it's high time that
they made an Amistad for fucking JAKKS.

797
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,130
You know, what about all the
livestock? What about the
fucking Dodo Bird? You know,

798
00:47:28,131 --> 00:47:31,870
what about the fucking llamas give it
just couldn't be in the middle of nowhere

799
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:35,950
and somebody has a fucking Lama,
you know, how did it get there?

800
00:47:35,951 --> 00:47:39,910
That thing doesn't have a story. That
thing doesn't it need to go, you know,

801
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:44,200
check out his family tree and figured
out where the fuck it came from.

802
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:49,990
What the hell was I? I was
in, no, no, I was in Richmond,

803
00:47:49,991 --> 00:47:54,991
Virginia and I'm driving down the street
with the guy who works over there,

804
00:47:55,690 --> 00:48:00,580
buzz with one Z who was one of
my favorite people in comedy.

805
00:48:00,581 --> 00:48:05,180
The guys literally 60 years old and he's
still hits on like 22 year olds and he

806
00:48:05,181 --> 00:48:08,350
creeps him out every time he does
it and he doesn't give a shit.

807
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:12,460
And uh, you know, I got to
respect him for that, but anyways,

808
00:48:12,461 --> 00:48:16,810
would drive it in the radio station and
there's a fucking Lama in the middle of

809
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:20,680
Richmond, Virginia. And, uh, you know,

810
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:26,590
I really wanted to know why.
You know,

811
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,810
what exactly,
what do people do with llamas?

812
00:48:29,730 --> 00:48:32,380
Devin tell you guys that I love
goats if ever told you that shit.

813
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:37,570
Like the goat is the perfect pet for me
because I haven't, I like to fucking,

814
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:40,240
I have a tendency to fuck with animals.
You know what I mean?

815
00:48:40,241 --> 00:48:44,710
I fuck with people and it doesn't stop
there. You know, I don't know what it is.

816
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:48,550
I stopped playing with the puppy and
then eventually I rolled him over on his

817
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:53,080
back. I semi sorta hold him down,
which gets them all fucking, uh,

818
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:57,610
you know,
all aggressive and next thing you know,

819
00:48:57,770 --> 00:49:01,240
they take a bite out of my hand,
you know, take a chunk out of me.

820
00:49:01,241 --> 00:49:04,180
So that's why I don't have a fucking
Doug because I turned them into a,

821
00:49:04,181 --> 00:49:07,240
those dogs you see on the news
that need to get put down.

822
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:13,120
So I found goats actually enjoy that shit.
Then when you look in,

823
00:49:13,121 --> 00:49:14,980
you know,
when you're,

824
00:49:14,981 --> 00:49:17,890
when you're looking the other way and
go to take a run at yes. You know,

825
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:21,950
they're like a dirty player and uh,
it was,

826
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:27,170
it was a classic dirty player from
way back in the fucking day. I,

827
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,560
even Chris nine and island, you
know, he would do some shit.

828
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,620
He did Rick Middleton in the mouth
with this the button end of his stick.

829
00:49:32,621 --> 00:49:34,960
That's kind of a dirty, but I know
he was never really into boarding.

830
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:37,163
I'll Samuelson.

831
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:42,330
That's what a goal is to go is the
all Samuelson a fucking farm animals.

832
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:45,400
Anytime you've got your head down and
you're facing the bar and the thing,

833
00:49:45,401 --> 00:49:46,390
I'll take a run at you.

834
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:50,140
And the problem is it never gets
suspended from the league. All right.

835
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:53,110
This is the Monday morning podcast.
My name is bill burr.

836
00:49:53,111 --> 00:49:57,790
I mentioned that earlier. And uh,
currently I am in the midst of the, uh,

837
00:49:57,791 --> 00:50:02,440
the uninformed a radio tour,
which a is uninformed,

838
00:50:02,441 --> 00:50:05,860
the radio show I do with Joe de Rosa and
the two of us around on tour right now

839
00:50:05,861 --> 00:50:10,660
to hype the show and things
are going great. And our
next stop is going to be in,

840
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:15,700
uh, Washington DC, the
weekend of, uh, you know what,

841
00:50:15,701 --> 00:50:17,110
I don't know what fucking weekend it is.

842
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:18,880
I think it's the first
weekend in November.

843
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:23,890
Let me go here and go onto my new fancy
website. If you guys checked it out yet,

844
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:28,110
if you're not on my website right now
and you have on myspace page, you know,

845
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,840
they'll do it now cause you'll lose the
fucking podcast. But at the end of it,

846
00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:35,630
go to [inaudible] dot com and a brand
new sleep website with a bunch of sexy

847
00:50:35,631 --> 00:50:40,610
photos of me, um, that make me look like
I'm a lot cooler than I am. All right,

848
00:50:40,611 --> 00:50:42,350
November 6th through the eighth,

849
00:50:42,351 --> 00:50:45,380
I'll be at the Improv in Washington
DC on the uninformed tour,

850
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,380
me and Joe de Rosa and on,
uh,

851
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:51,560
the 11th November,
sorry,

852
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:55,370
November 13th through the 15th,

853
00:50:55,640 --> 00:51:00,110
we'll be at Zany comedy club in
Nashville, Tennessee. And uh,

854
00:51:00,111 --> 00:51:03,950
the next big data after that is going
to be at Carolines in New York City,

855
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:10,160
uh, December 4th through the seventh.
And if anybody cares on December 8th,

856
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:13,970
I will be at the La Forum. Am I
going to be doing stand up? No,

857
00:51:13,971 --> 00:51:15,950
I'm not going to be watching ACDC.

858
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:20,900
ACDC had the La Forum, but I
tell you guys, my pumpkin died.

859
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:26,930
My pumpkin. I mean technically, I don't
know. Well, when did the Pumpkin Pie,

860
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:31,400
this is going to get like the pro life
pro choice pumpkin people up in uh,

861
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:35,420
up in an uproar here when,
when exactly does a Pumpkin,

862
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:40,580
like what is going on? You know, that's
just so much shit I don't know in life.

863
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:44,930
Is this stem was that was
that it's fucking in biblical
cord and you set it free.

864
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:48,290
Now it goes off to live a life and
hopefully not marry the wrong person,

865
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:49,221
you know,

866
00:51:49,221 --> 00:51:53,640
and get divorced and end up on a Fuckin
futon or the second you snip that the

867
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:58,130
does is the function. The function is
the fucking pumpkin dead. The function.

868
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:00,470
It's a good name for a band.

869
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:05,860
Come up on stage playing fucking P
funk with Pumpkin's on your heads.

870
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,600
And you know what?
If he had a catch phrase,

871
00:52:08,601 --> 00:52:12,770
you could be a huge comedian and you
could play the La Forum. Now, seriously,

872
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:15,560
this is what I learned with Pumpkin's.
All right.

873
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:20,090
Don't call him three weeks before because
they die in your refrigerator and it

874
00:52:20,091 --> 00:52:23,360
makes you sad and you've got to throw
them out and nobody even got to see him.

875
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:28,180
So, uh, so I gotta make another one. I
have to make another one. You know what?

876
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:31,040
This is just classic me
on my fucking podcast.

877
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:34,610
I started talking about some shit and
I forgot where the fuck I was going.

878
00:52:34,611 --> 00:52:38,990
And now here I am. Here I am
pulled over the side of the road,

879
00:52:38,991 --> 00:52:42,850
looking at the map, trying to figure out,
all right, let's go to the questions. Uh,

880
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:47,720
you're new to my podcast. Um, I do,
uh, answer questions every week.

881
00:52:47,721 --> 00:52:49,280
People email me,
they email

882
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:55,400
me@billatbillbird.com or they go to my
mind space page and I try to answer as

883
00:52:55,401 --> 00:52:58,310
many as I can. And, um, you know,

884
00:52:58,311 --> 00:53:02,300
people try to enlighten me like
a, you know, what is a Yak?

885
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,910
You know,
what is a Yak?

886
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:09,110
Is that like a fucking druggie
cow with this hippie hair?

887
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:12,290
You don't want to fucking
Google a fucking Yak right now.

888
00:53:12,291 --> 00:53:15,590
And I'm looking at an image.
How do you spell yak?

889
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:19,520
It's not why a c k that means you puked.
Speaking of which to,

890
00:53:19,521 --> 00:53:23,420
you know when I was looking at all
the different Pumpkin, uh, pictures,

891
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,300
you know,
ideas pumpkin's that one where you,

892
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:31,260
where your carve of pumpkin phase with
its mouth open and then you take the

893
00:53:31,261 --> 00:53:34,770
inside of the Pumpkin and place it around
the mouth and it looks like it puked

894
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:38,940
is very hacky.
They must've been 80 pumpkin's like that.

895
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:44,880
Jesus Christ. But the
debt, that's a fucking Yak.

896
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:51,210
Wow. Okay. I've got some a
don't fuck with me horns.

897
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:56,010
It looks like, it looks like a
Texas longhorn that needs a haircut.

898
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:02,010
Is a guy milking one? Oh, is
that a woman? Hang on a second.

899
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:06,030
Yak uses. You guys want to
learn about JAKKS. Here we go.

900
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:10,770
Statue of Golden Jakks in downtown Tibet.
Exactly

901
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:14,610
the fuck are you x doing over here?

902
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:20,130
The YAC is truly the treasure
of the plateau. Well,

903
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:21,600
why don't you let me be the judge of it.

904
00:54:21,601 --> 00:54:24,300
I hate when people make up my mind for me.
All right.

905
00:54:24,301 --> 00:54:27,820
Evidently this Douche bag says it's
the treasure of the plateau. Well,

906
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:32,160
what does its competition?
I'm the gopher. All right.

907
00:54:32,161 --> 00:54:33,870
As the inscription reads below,

908
00:54:33,871 --> 00:54:37,950
the Golden Statue of Jakks is in a
busy intersection in downtown La,

909
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:39,900
Hoffa in the mountain,

910
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:43,410
Tundra and ice desert of the
Tibetan plateau with altitude,

911
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,930
altitude soaring over 19,000 feet.

912
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:51,780
Jakks flourish where other
domestic DCE die because of this.

913
00:54:51,781 --> 00:54:55,560
People inhabiting this region
use the Yag for everything.

914
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,250
Okay. That's an open ended sentence. Okay.

915
00:54:59,251 --> 00:55:03,720
So they obviously use it as a food source.
There's a girl milking one,

916
00:55:03,721 --> 00:55:08,430
some Tibetan lady, and uh,
they use it for everything.

917
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:09,190
Okay.

918
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:13,110
Are you lifting the tail up and doing
something disgusting that's on Youtube or

919
00:55:13,111 --> 00:55:16,950
is it more tube eight?
The YAC is inescapable in La Hasa.

920
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:18,691
The accurate,

921
00:55:18,691 --> 00:55:23,580
slightly sour smell of yak
butter permeates the streets.

922
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:26,730
Okay.
I guess I'll never be going to lots of,

923
00:55:26,731 --> 00:55:31,731
who the fuck wants to smell
sour butter at 19,000 feet?

924
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:34,820
I, you know, something
I would not be able to,

925
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:37,770
to keep the look of disgust off my face.

926
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:41,340
And then they all start speaking into
bed and thinking that I was some American

927
00:55:41,341 --> 00:55:44,400
who thought they were above
people rather than do.

928
00:55:44,401 --> 00:55:47,490
There's a fucking pungent smell,
you know,

929
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:52,530
a tangent into the mainstream
was will Ferrell in a anchorman,

930
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:59,370
pungent stings the
nostrils. Um, all right,

931
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:04,940
so it permeates the streets and temples
where pilgrims burn the whitish yellow

932
00:56:05,191 --> 00:56:10,191
fat at a numerable altars and carry
smoking candles through the streets.

933
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:18,030
Let me just make a living like that.
This lady milk at a Yak, no laptop,

934
00:56:18,031 --> 00:56:22,680
no iPhone dress like an Apache
everyday.

935
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:26,740
Just reach underneath some fucking
JAKKS utter. And there you go.

936
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:30,670
You don't have to go down to,
uh, go down and get a smoothie.

937
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:37,140
Yak Milk is golden in color and
very rich and fat at seven to 8%.

938
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:40,900
And why the fuck is she so
skinny and as a Swedish taste?

939
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:45,310
Then why did you just describe it? You
know, you know what? Fuck this website.

940
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:51,070
He said sour smell. And now you're saying
it's a sour smell with a Swedish taste?

941
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,090
Maybe that's why their eyes are so
squinty. It's not because their eyes,

942
00:56:55,091 --> 00:56:58,230
I like this because they're confused.
They say it doesn't make sense, you know,

943
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:00,850
smell sour taste.
So sweet.

944
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:06,490
No protection from Jakks is
seasonal hybrid JAKKS oh good. Okay.

945
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:11,530
Everybody's on the global warming and I
want to want to far it has like 90% less

946
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:14,800
, uh, uh, got damaged
on the tip of my tongue.

947
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:18,430
What the fuck kind of gas is in cow's gas

948
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:24,760
begins with an m methane.
Maybe JAKKS have less methane gas.

949
00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:28,720
Is that the green people? They're going
to do that. Eat a Yak Burger instead.

950
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:34,120
All right. I think I'm sick
of yaks at this point. You
guys sick a good, you know,

951
00:57:34,121 --> 00:57:38,440
and I felt that you're like, all right,
bill enough with the fucking JAKKS. Um,

952
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:39,130
so anyways,

953
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:42,760
they're into bed and next time I do
a road gig in like fucking Austin or

954
00:57:42,761 --> 00:57:45,280
something, I swear to God I'm a drive
by and be like, what the fuck is that?

955
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:47,350
And some guy names,
you know,

956
00:57:47,890 --> 00:57:51,670
fuck with oneF is going to be like a,
that's a Yak.

957
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:54,580
What is it doing here? I don't
know buddy. I don't know.

958
00:57:54,581 --> 00:57:56,650
My job is just take you the radio station.

959
00:57:56,740 --> 00:58:00,310
Why don't you just focus on that being
funny is spelled sell some more fucking

960
00:58:00,311 --> 00:58:01,600
tickets.
You know what I mean?

961
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:05,260
How many fucking specialty you need to
have before we can fill up a fucking

962
00:58:05,261 --> 00:58:07,510
comedy club?
Why don't you get a catch phrase?

963
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:10,690
Why don't you just go on stage and just
talk about JAKKS for fucking hour and

964
00:58:10,691 --> 00:58:12,310
then you can be the fucking yet guy.

965
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:15,300
And I wouldn't have to drive you to the
fucking radio station because you would

966
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:17,920
have sold out second.
They put you fucking name up.

967
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:21,310
You ever think about that will
then shut the fuck up then. Okay.

968
00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:27,940
Um, all right, so let's get
on with the podcast questions.

969
00:58:27,941 --> 00:58:28,774
Hey Bill,

970
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:33,280
have you ever auditioned for SNL
when you lived in New York City?

971
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:36,430
That group seems to be clickish,

972
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:40,180
but I wondered if Lauren Michaels ever
gave you a chance to be on the show.

973
00:58:40,181 --> 00:58:44,740
You know what? I can't remember
if I audition for SNL or mad TV,

974
00:58:44,741 --> 00:58:48,760
but it was about nine years ago and I
know I bombed because I went in there with

975
00:58:48,761 --> 00:58:52,060
jokes rather than characters I had.

976
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:54,700
I would have like a quick care,

977
00:58:54,701 --> 00:58:58,600
I'd have a character and then just do a
quick joke about them and then move on

978
00:58:58,601 --> 00:59:01,840
to something else.
Like I remember one of my characters,

979
00:59:01,870 --> 00:59:06,010
I played a guy who was in the
Klan who had a speech impediment.

980
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:11,500
He gets blocked on Edwards and I just
remember part of the audition of me

981
00:59:11,501 --> 00:59:11,980
staying,

982
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:16,330
they go in the noon to noon and then just
sort of ended and everyone was looking

983
00:59:16,331 --> 00:59:20,920
at me like I had fucking
12 heads. So, uh, yeah, I,

984
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:25,100
I don't think the reason why I'm
not on SNL is because it's clickish.

985
00:59:25,101 --> 00:59:26,170
It's probably because,
uh,

986
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:31,220
Lauren had watched that tape at some
point and projectile vomited. All right,

987
00:59:31,221 --> 00:59:36,050
go. Me and a friend at work
run a celebrity death pool.

988
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:40,580
If you don't know what this is, here
it is in a nutshell. You put an egg,

989
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:45,640
you put an x amount of a month and
then you get a list of randomly picked

990
00:59:45,861 --> 00:59:48,500
potential people who may die very soon.

991
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,330
You know what I noticed
celebrity death pool is,

992
00:59:50,331 --> 00:59:54,140
and you didn't really describe it.
Well basically you a,

993
00:59:54,141 --> 00:59:58,160
you pick not random people you paint,
you pick random celebrities,

994
00:59:58,161 --> 01:00:00,530
famous people who you
think are going to die.

995
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,480
I thought it was in a calendar year.

996
01:00:02,481 --> 01:00:05,990
I guess they do it every month because
these guys have a gambling problem set.

997
01:00:05,991 --> 01:00:07,490
Basically. You'd be like, you know what?

998
01:00:07,491 --> 01:00:12,491
I think a fucking Lisa Lu c or
whatever the fuck her name is,

999
01:00:12,561 --> 01:00:14,540
Lucy Lu,
I think she's going to uh,

1000
01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:18,710
eat some bad sushi and a, yeah. I said,

1001
01:00:18,711 --> 01:00:20,750
should we film in over
in Japan and what's,

1002
01:00:20,751 --> 01:00:22,880
what's that Sushi that they
eat over there? Some sort of,

1003
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:25,280
if eat the wrong part of it,
you could fucking die.

1004
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,970
And if some macho thing to eat it,
she's going to go do that, you know,

1005
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:32,650
to prove she's one of the guys and she
hangs out with the crew and she's going

1006
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,700
to die like that. That's
what you would do. All right.

1007
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:39,860
The payout happens only when
cnn.com announces it. Oh,
this is the are rules. Okay,

1008
01:00:39,861 --> 01:00:43,910
I'm back to the question now. The obvious
favorites or people like Fidel Castro,

1009
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:48,770
Barbara Bush, Amy Winehouse,
that midget from Austin Powers.

1010
01:00:48,771 --> 01:00:52,130
That's a good one.
Patrick Swayze, etc. Well,

1011
01:00:52,131 --> 01:00:55,490
every month everyone in the
pool gets to pick a wild card.

1012
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:58,640
Who wasn't on the original roster?
Well,

1013
01:00:58,641 --> 01:01:02,660
I took a lot of shit this past
week. Ah, I don't want to read this.

1014
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:05,180
I don't want to read this because I don't
want to put ideas in people's heads.

1015
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:09,830
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just, you know
what? I got you guys all excited. No, no,

1016
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:14,240
I'm not fucking reading that
one. Um, all right, Bill.

1017
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:19,460
I recently grew a beard. There's a
lot of social commentary in this. Uh,

1018
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:20,750
these questions this week.
Bill,

1019
01:01:20,751 --> 01:01:25,250
I recently grew a beard and had an
argument with a gay guy that I work with.

1020
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:29,150
He told me that all men
with beards are gay.

1021
01:01:33,970 --> 01:01:38,390
That must have really killed your fucking
idea of growing a beard. So he says,

1022
01:01:38,510 --> 01:01:42,440
and my whole argument was where to gay
people get off just claiming something as

1023
01:01:42,441 --> 01:01:44,630
their own just because they like it.

1024
01:01:45,290 --> 01:01:49,580
Am I the only one who thinks that they
can get away with this logic that they

1025
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:52,970
can get away with this logic is
fucking crazy. You know, waxes,

1026
01:01:52,971 --> 01:01:57,350
eyebrows and going 10 to tanning salons.
I'll give him that one. But a beard.

1027
01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:00,350
When I think of people with beards,
I don't think gay.

1028
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:04,880
I think lumberjack swinging axes.
It's kind of gay.

1029
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,700
Um, Ben tobers treats thumb. Did you
ever see that Monty python sketch?

1030
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:14,260
I'm a lumberjack and I don't care.
Have a good day. Buh, Buh, Buh Buh.

1031
01:02:14,270 --> 01:02:15,530
And eventually he gets gay or,

1032
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:20,531
and dare and pull it out a fucking
dresses and dress just like me.

1033
01:02:20,941 --> 01:02:24,630
Mom. He's a warmer jacket. He
don't care. He fucking sucks.

1034
01:02:24,631 --> 01:02:29,310
Cock any licks the bulls. Anyways,
when he thinks of a beard, uh,

1035
01:02:29,311 --> 01:02:32,940
he thinks of lumberjack swinging
access like that job still exist.

1036
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:36,810
Don't they have fucking chain sounds
at this point? Playoff hockey. Yup.

1037
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:41,580
I'll give you that. And I think that
some gay people, some in quotes,

1038
01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:46,200
gay people have gotten way
too comfortable in society.

1039
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:50,250
Those bastards. Where did they
get off? Be uncomfortable.

1040
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:54,030
Cause if he lived in the
south and not New York City,

1041
01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:58,950
he'd be dragged behind a truck for saying
that all men with beards are gay and

1042
01:02:58,951 --> 01:03:03,150
not that I condone that behavior but
maybe some gays have it coming to them.

1043
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:06,750
Jesus Christ.
Then he writes,

1044
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:10,920
that's all really is that all uh,
you know you pop off at the mouth.

1045
01:03:10,921 --> 01:03:15,210
There are consequences if you
would your thoughts please.

1046
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:16,890
I'll tell you what happened.

1047
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:21,920
I think you're a little uncomfortable
with gay people and you wanted to grow a

1048
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:26,730
beard and you are all set on grown in
and then some gay guy came up maybe

1049
01:03:26,731 --> 01:03:29,790
realizing that you are homophobic,
decided to fuck with your head.

1050
01:03:29,790 --> 01:03:34,790
And he said all men with beards are
gay and it pissed you off because you

1051
01:03:34,921 --> 01:03:37,560
thought this was going to be some rugged
shit that was going to get you some

1052
01:03:37,561 --> 01:03:42,510
pussy. And as you grow in it, you can't
get that guy out of your head going, oh,

1053
01:03:42,511 --> 01:03:47,040
men with beards. Aughey so
here's my number, sweetie.

1054
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:53,520
Um, I don't know. I don't think
all men were put there to gay. Um,

1055
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:58,260
and I think a lot of times when you
see a guy with a beard who is gay,

1056
01:03:58,530 --> 01:04:03,530
you can tell because it's too
manicured to George Michael ask,

1057
01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:05,101
you know what I mean?

1058
01:04:05,101 --> 01:04:10,101
But you gotta you gotta you do have to
manicure it to a certain point manicure

1059
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:13,830
at such as that's fucking nails,
whatever. You know what I'm saying?

1060
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:17,370
You got to trim it. It's two
landscapes, but you know,

1061
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:21,360
you've got to keep it off your neck or if
it's just itchy is fucking hell. Uh, no,

1062
01:04:21,361 --> 01:04:23,490
I don't think beers are gay.
Um,

1063
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:27,990
I think I thought more like
hipster guys do it, you know,

1064
01:04:27,991 --> 01:04:30,480
and all the hipsters are trying
to address like they're, uh,

1065
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:34,170
during the Beastie boys sabotage video,
you know,

1066
01:04:34,171 --> 01:04:36,870
they're trying to dress that
way, but there's this air of, Oh,

1067
01:04:36,871 --> 01:04:38,500
I didn't even notice,
you know,

1068
01:04:38,570 --> 01:04:42,390
it just accidentally dressed
like I was in the 70s.

1069
01:04:43,710 --> 01:04:46,920
Um, one of my thoughts, my
thoughts are basically, dude,

1070
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:49,560
I think that if you want to grow a beard,
you should grow a beard.

1071
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:54,060
And I think if a gay guy in down south
and all guys who have beards are gay,

1072
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:59,040
I would like to think that people would
just laugh and still grow a beard if

1073
01:04:59,041 --> 01:05:04,041
they wanted to rather than
get all uncomfortable to
the point that they'd want

1074
01:05:04,111 --> 01:05:07,830
to drag a gay guy behind the truck
and beat the shit out of him. Uh,

1075
01:05:07,831 --> 01:05:11,910
I don't think anybody has that
come into them in that instance.

1076
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:16,140
You know what I mean?
Um, but if I was gay,

1077
01:05:16,170 --> 01:05:18,730
I would probably be careful
of who I said that to.

1078
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:22,030
Considering there are people out there
who feel that people who do that should

1079
01:05:22,031 --> 01:05:24,520
be dragged behind a truck and get,
you know what you know,

1080
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:27,910
in a way the person is right.
You, when you do run your mouth,

1081
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:31,500
there are consequences cause you
don't realize who the psychos are.

1082
01:05:31,590 --> 01:05:36,400
And this guy seems a little psychotic,
a little psychotic.

1083
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:38,620
He doesn't condone the behavior,
but he's just saying,

1084
01:05:41,710 --> 01:05:45,430
Jesus, can we have a lighthearted question
here where I don't have to, you know?

1085
01:05:46,570 --> 01:05:48,250
Okay. Question. Uh, Bill,

1086
01:05:48,251 --> 01:05:52,210
I was having a cigarette
outside a restaurant last
week and a guy who is missing

1087
01:05:52,211 --> 01:05:57,211
both arms comes over telling me to put
it out because I was disturbing him with

1088
01:05:58,811 --> 01:06:01,750
my secondhand smoke. All right,
you guys just making this shit up.

1089
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:05,650
This really seems made up, but you
know, just for the comedy of it,

1090
01:06:05,651 --> 01:06:08,470
I'll go with it.
He was wearing a muscle shirt.

1091
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:12,520
Okay. Um, guess I'm still
going to believe this.

1092
01:06:12,521 --> 01:06:15,820
He was wearing a muscle shirt
completely exposing his nubs.

1093
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:21,460
I jokingly told this guy, I'll put it
out if he beats me at a game of rock,

1094
01:06:21,461 --> 01:06:24,610
paper, scissors and its
questions. Bullshit.

1095
01:06:24,611 --> 01:06:27,040
You didn't say this eight is it bullshit?

1096
01:06:27,041 --> 01:06:29,710
This is even if he had
a muscle tee shirt on,

1097
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:32,170
even if he had no arms in,

1098
01:06:32,171 --> 01:06:37,171
even if he fucking came over and told
you to put out the cigarette is no way.

1099
01:06:38,261 --> 01:06:42,400
You said if you beat me, if I'd be, if
he beats you at a game of rock, paper,

1100
01:06:42,401 --> 01:06:46,540
scissors, you know this. That's like
the shit you wish you said when he left.

1101
01:06:46,930 --> 01:06:48,880
But I will go with it.
Okay.

1102
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:52,900
You know far be it for me to say that
people are lying to me. All right.

1103
01:06:52,901 --> 01:06:56,350
Or exaggerating.
So evidently after he did this,

1104
01:06:57,430 --> 01:07:00,970
I'm the guy went off,
the guy went off on me and I felt bad.

1105
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:05,550
So I put it out. Oh, after
you destroyed the guy,

1106
01:07:07,630 --> 01:07:10,000
then I put it down. I pissed them off
and I was like, all right, there you go.

1107
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:11,080
They asked the question,

1108
01:07:11,081 --> 01:07:16,081
should amputees or people with horrific
physical deformities warn you about it

1109
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:20,800
before starting startling you with?
They're terrifying.

1110
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:24,880
Handicap. All right, that's
hilarious. What was he supposed to do?

1111
01:07:25,930 --> 01:07:29,970
Like beyond the other side of whatever
building dairy queen you were sitting in

1112
01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:33,580
and be like, why God just like, you know,

1113
01:07:33,581 --> 01:07:37,750
I don't have any arms said I'm wearing a
tank top and I'm color. I have the car.

1114
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:41,620
So if you want to finish yourself,
serve and not get startled,

1115
01:07:43,090 --> 01:07:47,230
you know, you've got three seconds
to close your eyes. Um, you know,

1116
01:07:47,231 --> 01:07:50,800
something that is a, uh,
that is, yeah, it's, it's,

1117
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:53,710
it's one of those things where you're
not trying to be mean. I don't know.

1118
01:07:53,711 --> 01:07:57,760
I can't speak for you, but
for me personally, you know,
you're not trying to be, uh,

1119
01:07:59,350 --> 01:08:01,360
you know, insensitive. But you know,

1120
01:08:01,361 --> 01:08:05,590
if you haven't been to war or you don't
work in an emergency room, they, yeah,

1121
01:08:05,770 --> 01:08:09,700
there are shit that you're not expecting,
but you know, you kind of roll with it.

1122
01:08:11,230 --> 01:08:13,390
Um, I don't think that they
should have to warn you about it,

1123
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:19,020
but I don't know what you have to do
as a person to become more used to it.

1124
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:24,230
I don't know. You know what? Sometimes,
sometimes I don't have the answers.

1125
01:08:25,070 --> 01:08:25,903
I'll tell you it's fucked up.

1126
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:30,350
If you guys seen that new show on
MTV called scarred, it's insane.

1127
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:35,420
It's basically footage of people
trying to do tricks on bikes,

1128
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:41,540
on skateboards and on rollerblades
and it's not the funny,

1129
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:46,190
Oh, and he lands on his nuts. It's
bones popping out of the skin.

1130
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:50,420
And I'm gonna tell you something,
dude. It is fucking unwatchable.

1131
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,750
And uh,
it was so twisted and sick.

1132
01:08:53,751 --> 01:08:58,751
I actually sent a text message to ob
from the OPN Anthony show to tell him to

1133
01:08:59,481 --> 01:09:04,370
get footage of it because it just seemed
like such an opn Anthony show clip,

1134
01:09:05,150 --> 01:09:08,690
you know, they already did two girls,
one cup. Now they could do a thing where,

1135
01:09:08,691 --> 01:09:13,340
you know, can you sit here and watch
bones come out of somebody's fucking hand?

1136
01:09:13,670 --> 01:09:18,440
Oh, brutal. All right.
Um, okay. Real quick.

1137
01:09:18,441 --> 01:09:22,160
Overrated. Underrated. Overrated.
Neal. Pert of rush. Awesome drummer.

1138
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:25,700
But he gets way too much credit.
You know what? I would, uh,

1139
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:30,470
I would definitely say he's an awesome
drummer, but yeah, he's too robotic.

1140
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:36,380
I don't hear the, uh, I don't
hear a groove. I like John
Bonam like I'm way better.

1141
01:09:36,670 --> 01:09:38,060
All right.
Underrated Comic,

1142
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:43,120
Louis C k some about three times
and he kills each and every time.

1143
01:09:43,730 --> 01:09:45,980
Oh Louise,
one of my favorite comics of all times.

1144
01:09:45,981 --> 01:09:49,400
I think he's fucking unbelievable
and he blows me away. So,

1145
01:09:51,230 --> 01:09:53,960
um, if somebody is saying he isn't,
then yeah, he is definitely underrated.

1146
01:09:54,030 --> 01:09:57,860
All right. But not amongst
Comedians, I can tell you
that. All right, last question.

1147
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:03,140
Bill, here's a podcast question for
you. Uh, your business is comedy, right?

1148
01:10:04,010 --> 01:10:05,120
So let me ask you,

1149
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:10,430
do you run the business or
does the business run you
hope? You know what I mean?

1150
01:10:10,490 --> 01:10:13,460
Chairs. I gotta be honest with
you. I don't know what you made.

1151
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:19,480
Do I run the business as you mean my
personal business or show business?

1152
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:23,060
I definitely do not run.
Show business. Are you,

1153
01:10:23,090 --> 01:10:28,090
do you mean do I take the time to fly
a kite each day and reflect on the fact

1154
01:10:28,611 --> 01:10:33,611
that I'm alive or do I just sit here and
do podcasts and fucking try to attempt

1155
01:10:35,811 --> 01:10:39,410
to finish blogs and shit? Um, I
don't know. It depends on the day.

1156
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:41,840
Depends on the day.

1157
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:47,810
I got my first massage in about
eight months and legal by the way.

1158
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:48,890
And uh,

1159
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:53,840
I felt great after it and I've decided
that I was going to start doing that.

1160
01:10:53,870 --> 01:10:58,640
You know, you know me, you know I
have fucking OCD. So I was like,

1161
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:01,880
I want to do it every week.
You know,

1162
01:11:01,970 --> 01:11:06,320
I'll spend 50 grand a
year on fucking massages,

1163
01:11:06,321 --> 01:11:10,010
which would cause stress. You know, I
really gotta do something about my, my,

1164
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:15,060
I, I'm just like, I just realized
that I'm going to be in Nashville,

1165
01:11:15,061 --> 01:11:18,840
Tennessee and before I do Nashville,
the Wednesday before I do Nashville,

1166
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:23,640
I'm going to do the Bob and Tom Show in
Indianapolis. And I was thinking, well,

1167
01:11:23,641 --> 01:11:26,910
you know, I'm trying to go to every
sports fucking team for some dumb reason.

1168
01:11:27,150 --> 01:11:31,950
And I'm literally contemplating driving
down to go to a Memphis grizzly game

1169
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:36,150
after I do Bob and Tom.
It's like a 400 mile drive.

1170
01:11:36,510 --> 01:11:39,870
And then after the game I would then
have to drive over to Nashville and get

1171
01:11:39,871 --> 01:11:43,680
there in time to check in, fall asleep,
and then do the radio in the morning.

1172
01:11:44,430 --> 01:11:47,700
And uh, I'd like to tell you
that I'm not going to do it,

1173
01:11:47,701 --> 01:11:52,701
but I think I'm going to do it and
possibly hang around and drive up to the

1174
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:55,860
Cincinnati Bengals game on a Sunday.

1175
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:02,160
It's pathetic, right? But, uh, I dunno,

1176
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:03,450
I think I'm going to do it.

1177
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:08,190
Am I running from something or am
I just a fucking maniac? I Dunno.

1178
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:10,980
I Dunno what, but I can tell you this. Um,

1179
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:13,710
you guys don't need to worry
about my fucking problems.

1180
01:12:14,010 --> 01:12:17,480
Let's wrap up this podcast. I think it
was a very good podcast. We learned, uh,

1181
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:23,220
at some social commentary and uh,
we learned about Jakks,

1182
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:26,770
learned about my OCD.
We learned about Pumpkin.

1183
01:12:26,771 --> 01:12:28,230
You guys will learn about pumpkin carving.

1184
01:12:28,710 --> 01:12:32,370
Something I learned when I was watching
Martha Stewart who I can't stand

1185
01:12:32,371 --> 01:12:32,791
watching.

1186
01:12:32,791 --> 01:12:35,850
It just so happened that I wanted to
carve a pumpkin and I was flipping through

1187
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:41,060
and I saw pumpkin and I stopped and she
sat there with her cold demeanor where

1188
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:44,070
you're poor core a point wouldn't
the things you want to do.

1189
01:12:44,490 --> 01:12:48,420
Cause she just seems like she'd be the
worst mother ever. Like couldn't hug you,

1190
01:12:49,230 --> 01:12:52,980
couldn't, she couldn't show
love and would just, you know,

1191
01:12:53,190 --> 01:12:57,390
could never admit when she was rung. And
Geez, I'm fucking projecting right now.

1192
01:12:57,780 --> 01:12:59,910
Um, so basically what you
want to do with the Pumpkin,

1193
01:12:59,911 --> 01:13:03,450
what I learned is you want to lead
area the side where you're going to be

1194
01:13:03,451 --> 01:13:06,660
carving into. You want to make
that as thin as humanly possible.

1195
01:13:06,870 --> 01:13:11,610
That way when you light the candle inside
of it, it glows this bright orange.

1196
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:15,990
So if you carve something
scary or something like that,

1197
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:17,280
it's the shit.

1198
01:13:17,610 --> 01:13:22,350
I really got to figure out how to upload
pictures from my cell phone onto my

1199
01:13:22,351 --> 01:13:25,560
computer cause you gotta see this ACDC
Pumpkin and I mean, you know what?

1200
01:13:25,561 --> 01:13:27,330
Now I'm going to hype it up so
much. You can be like, dude,

1201
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:31,440
it really didn't live up to the
hype and then I'll be hurt. And uh,

1202
01:13:31,470 --> 01:13:33,570
which would be the reverse
of what I wanted to do.

1203
01:13:34,590 --> 01:13:38,100
The reverse of the exercise of carving
a Pumpkin was for me to be a happier

1204
01:13:38,101 --> 01:13:42,200
human being, more at peace. Um, all right,

1205
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:46,890
let's, let's fucking wrap this up. I say
this every week and then I keep going.

1206
01:13:46,950 --> 01:13:51,270
Let's, let's re hype the
gigs, all rights I have. Um,

1207
01:13:51,690 --> 01:13:54,930
I'll be at the Improv, Washington
DC, November 6th through the eighth.

1208
01:13:55,380 --> 01:14:00,380
After that I'll be at Zany comedy club
November 13th through the fucking 15th.

1209
01:14:03,270 --> 01:14:06,690
And I'm, Hey, you know what? I'm going
to go to that Goddamn Bengals game.

1210
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:09,150
What do you think about that?
Any listeners in Cincinnati,

1211
01:14:09,910 --> 01:14:13,930
you got an extra fucking let me know.
I'll come up to your tailgate.

1212
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:18,070
We'll fucking eat some ribs that you cook
now out to you, don't it? I'll be like,

1213
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:23,020
uh, I'll be like a has been celebrity.
I'll do show up like, this is what my,

1214
01:14:23,530 --> 01:14:26,990
uh, my career has come to you.
Gotta you gotta pay me in,

1215
01:14:26,991 --> 01:14:31,630
in fucking smoked ribs and I'll
show up to your tailgate. Um,

1216
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:35,400
and uh, oh, I know one last thing. Uh,

1217
01:14:35,410 --> 01:14:39,820
we're going to be taping another episode
of uninformed. We always, uh, pre, uh,

1218
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:40,810
pre taped these things.

1219
01:14:40,990 --> 01:14:44,350
I'm going to try and get some clips
of it up on a uninformed radio,

1220
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:49,270
my face.com/uninformed
radio and a big news,

1221
01:14:49,271 --> 01:14:53,710
our guest is going to be Joe Perry
from Aerosmith. It's a long story.

1222
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:58,650
How I ended up, I'm meeting
somebody who was related to him and,

1223
01:14:58,820 --> 01:14:58,990
uh,

1224
01:14:58,990 --> 01:15:03,990
somehow it all came together
and I'm hoping I don't make
an ass of myself when I

1225
01:15:04,211 --> 01:15:08,170
interview him because I'm a
huge fan and, uh, so whatever.

1226
01:15:08,230 --> 01:15:12,250
So I will let you know when that episode
is going to air and we will definitely

1227
01:15:12,251 --> 01:15:16,510
start trying to get a audio clips from
the show because people seem to like the

1228
01:15:16,511 --> 01:15:20,650
very special, uh, what was it Thursday,

1229
01:15:20,651 --> 01:15:23,770
Monday morning podcast that I taped
before this one if you want to go into the

1230
01:15:23,771 --> 01:15:26,680
archives. All right. That's it. I'm
babbling. It's not funny anymore.

1231
01:15:26,681 --> 01:15:29,440
It's just torture. All right. Hope
all you guys have a good week.

1232
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:32,540
Please keep the questions coming and
I'm really enjoying them. The gun,

1233
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:35,230
the underrated overrated.
And uh,

1234
01:15:35,350 --> 01:15:39,130
if there's anything that I said that you
felt was wrong and you'd like to, uh,

1235
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:43,930
educate me, or if I asked any
questions. I know I asked about JAKKS.

1236
01:15:44,710 --> 01:15:47,650
Why don't you, why don't you tell me
about llamas? How about that? Where,

1237
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:51,970
where they're indigenous to for some
reason, I'm thinking the Arab community.

1238
01:15:53,710 --> 01:15:58,450
Um, all right. That's it.
That's it. I'm rubbing my face,
which means I'm exhausted.

1239
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:02,230
Or is that stress? Maybe it's stress.
Maybe I got too much shit to do.

1240
01:16:02,231 --> 01:16:05,050
So thanks for listening to the
Monday morning podcast. As always,

the Monday morning podcasts,

1247
01:17:06,430 --> 01:17:10,370
every podcast by saying,
what's going on?

1248
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:15,560
I got to come up with something else.
Maybe I should, maybe I should brand that.

1249
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:21,200
Like that guy, uh, Michael buffer or, uh,

1250
01:17:21,260 --> 01:17:24,950
the, uh, the big bouncer looking
guy from the UFC. You know,

1251
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:30,550
when he goes, are you ready? Are
you ready? Who's going? Yeah.

1252
01:17:31,470 --> 01:17:35,210
If for some reason he's
the only one I think,

1253
01:17:35,330 --> 01:17:38,360
I don't even fucking the typical, I didn't
research this, but as far as I know,

1254
01:17:38,361 --> 01:17:40,670
I think legally he's the
only one who can say,

1255
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:43,400
let's get it on before UFC match,

1256
01:17:43,550 --> 01:17:47,690
which is fucking ridiculous because he
didn't come up with, let's get it on.

1257
01:17:49,550 --> 01:17:50,383
You know,

1258
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:54,830
what's his face stiff fucking guy with
the beard who got shot by his dad,

1259
01:17:54,890 --> 01:17:59,420
used to wear the red hat, Marvin
Gaye. Marvin Gaye wrote a song,

1260
01:17:59,421 --> 01:18:01,190
let's get it on bending the 70s.

1261
01:18:02,150 --> 01:18:06,260
Evidently he was singing to some
fucking 14 year old girl. 16.

1262
01:18:06,510 --> 01:18:11,510
So I'll make them a freak 16 in the
studio trying to convince her to fuck him,

1263
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:17,960
you know, so I'm able to set
up a whole nother can of worms.

1264
01:18:17,961 --> 01:18:20,240
The whole r Kelly thing that uh,

1265
01:18:20,241 --> 01:18:24,830
I don't know it was acceptable back then
or was it, was there a double standard?

1266
01:18:25,070 --> 01:18:29,450
Wait a second. I was going to say Rupert
Murdoch wasn't Rupert Murdoch. Who the,

1267
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:32,300
what the fuck was that guy's name?
Who's that fucking guy?

1268
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:36,430
He was from France. Any, uh,

1269
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:41,390
he drugged up the 14 year old and a Jack
Nicholson's hot tub. Roman Polanski.

1270
01:18:42,210 --> 01:18:44,270
It's funny how he got in
trouble for that shit.

1271
01:18:44,271 --> 01:18:45,980
He had to literally leave the country.

1272
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:51,160
Marvin Gaye is lily singing a song about
how he wants to fuck a 16 year old and

1273
01:18:51,890 --> 01:18:55,720
nothing ever happened to him until
his dad shot him. But I'm, I think,

1274
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:59,300
I don't think that that
was related. Um, so anyway,

1275
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:05,060
I want to fuck a 16 year old.

1276
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:11,180
Let's get it on sugar.
I thought he was giving her,

1277
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:13,400
that's how young she was.
You couldn't even bribe with money.

1278
01:19:13,430 --> 01:19:14,263
She didn't know what it was.

1279
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:18,560
He was giving them those little
kid little Halloween candies. Oh,

1280
01:19:18,561 --> 01:19:23,210
did I carve a pumpkin this year? I tried.
I took a fucking picture of it. I caught,

1281
01:19:23,390 --> 01:19:27,770
I caught this awesome pumpkin. One
of them suck, but the other one,

1282
01:19:27,771 --> 01:19:29,810
the ACDC one,
and for the life of me,

1283
01:19:29,811 --> 01:19:32,780
I cannot upload it on
my fucking myspace page.

1284
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:37,040
A good friend of mine heard
my problem on my last podcast.

1285
01:19:37,070 --> 01:19:39,860
She showed me how to do it on my phone.

1286
01:19:39,861 --> 01:19:42,020
I was able to email the picture to myself.

1287
01:19:42,350 --> 01:19:44,900
I was able to save that
picture and my fucking

1288
01:19:46,790 --> 01:19:51,530
eye photo thing, whatever
the fuck that is.

1289
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:54,600
And then I went to upload it on my space
and then they're like, oh, we have a,

1290
01:19:54,610 --> 01:19:59,120
we have an error. There's an error.
I hate it. My space, how they go,

1291
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:03,380
sorry. There was an unexpected
error. It's like, you know what Tom,

1292
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:08,370
there's nothing unexpected about it at
this point. Okay. If it went through,

1293
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:11,610
that would have been unexpected.
All right.

1294
01:20:11,611 --> 01:20:15,330
I've got a little look at a little fucking
up piss and vinegar in me this week.

1295
01:20:15,930 --> 01:20:19,890
Um, anyways, uh, I do this
podcast once a week here. Um,

1296
01:20:20,670 --> 01:20:25,380
I do it on a billboard.com and
simultaneous simultaneously
here on my myspace

1297
01:20:25,381 --> 01:20:28,170
page.
And you can download these on a,

1298
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:33,900
was it iTunes and a yeah,
I do one of these every single week.

1299
01:20:33,901 --> 01:20:37,560
People ask me questions. I answered the
questions to the best of my ability.

1300
01:20:37,561 --> 01:20:42,090
And other than that, I rant about
shit and like I'm doing right now.

1301
01:20:42,210 --> 01:20:45,510
And, uh, before we get
started on the podcast, um,

1302
01:20:45,511 --> 01:20:49,920
I want to congratulate the Philadelphia
Phillies, but when in the world series,

1303
01:20:49,921 --> 01:20:54,540
look at that, they got this
second one. What a relief that is.

1304
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:55,860
I know the feeling right now.

1305
01:20:55,861 --> 01:20:59,760
No one can talk shit to you and no one
can say shit to you for a long time.

1306
01:20:59,761 --> 01:21:00,031
You know,

1307
01:21:00,031 --> 01:21:04,650
you realize how long you have to suck
now in baseball for anybody to give you

1308
01:21:04,651 --> 01:21:08,910
shit, you know, and Ed, you fucking
done that a couple of years ago.

1309
01:21:08,911 --> 01:21:11,490
I would've been in trouble in Camden
because there's nothing I would have.

1310
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:15,990
I could have sent him about
you. Actually, I could have,

1311
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:19,200
I still could have come up with something,
but I don't want to get into that.

1312
01:21:19,201 --> 01:21:22,920
I'm trying to mend fences. Um,
yeah, the Phillies fucking wanted,

1313
01:21:24,450 --> 01:21:27,750
you know, Pete the Goddamn
double race. And look at myself.

1314
01:21:27,751 --> 01:21:31,320
I talked myself into a corner because
I have nothing mean to say about that

1315
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:36,210
other than congratulations. And the
second year Nice. All comedy stops.

1316
01:21:37,890 --> 01:21:40,130
Um, anyways. You know what,
let me, let me see what, let's,

1317
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:44,910
let's hype what I have co what's hype,
what I have coming up this week. Um,

1318
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:46,740
I have,
uh,

1319
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:50,700
I have to open a fucking window to know
where the hell I have coming up. Oh,

1320
01:21:50,701 --> 01:21:54,810
I know where I'm going to be. I'm going
to be at the, uh, the Improv in DC.

1321
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:59,040
And let me tell you something.
Boys and girls tickets are going fast.

1322
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:04,920
Um, I get unbelievable
support in DC and, uh,

1323
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:09,000
the fuck is wrong with my website.
Don't start this,

1324
01:22:10,170 --> 01:22:12,600
don't start this. Oh, there it
is. I clicked on the wrong page.

1325
01:22:12,970 --> 01:22:17,400
Now I've got an unbelievable support
in DC. Um, last time I went there,

1326
01:22:17,401 --> 01:22:19,980
all shows sold out
before he even got there.

1327
01:22:21,210 --> 01:22:25,290
I didn't have to get up and do fucking
radio, but I still did it. I said, oh,

1328
01:22:25,291 --> 01:22:28,690
look who's calling in. It's
showed her rosa. Jodi is, uh,

1329
01:22:31,670 --> 01:22:34,200
uh, I'm in the middle of doing my
podcast. Let me call you right back.

1330
01:22:34,230 --> 01:22:38,190
I'll be done in about 20 minutes.
All right sweetie.

1331
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:42,270
Um, Joe Rosa, my cohost on uninformed,

1332
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:47,360
we're gonna be doing it this Friday and
our in studio guest is going to be a,

1333
01:22:47,401 --> 01:22:49,740
actually, he's calling is going
to be Joe Perry from Aerosmith.

1334
01:22:49,741 --> 01:22:52,620
So we're really excited and I'll let
you guys know when it's going to air

1335
01:22:52,621 --> 01:22:56,760
because we, uh, we prerecorded. But
getting back on topic this week,

1336
01:22:56,761 --> 01:22:58,980
I'm going to be at the
Improv in Washington DC.

1337
01:22:59,430 --> 01:23:03,660
Last I heard there was about
150 tickets left and a,

1338
01:23:03,661 --> 01:23:07,600
so if you want to go, uh, go to, uh,

1339
01:23:07,660 --> 01:23:11,500
what does it improv.com I know I got
gotta write down my myspace page.

1340
01:23:11,501 --> 01:23:14,680
You can click on it or if
you're on my, uh, my webpage,

1341
01:23:14,681 --> 01:23:17,770
if you just click on upcoming appearances,
there'll be a link right there.

1342
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:22,000
I'm going to be there in November
6th, November 7th, November 8th.

1343
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:24,240
And um,

1344
01:23:24,370 --> 01:23:29,370
it's part of the uninformed comedy tour
hyping my radio show with Joe to Rosa

1345
01:23:29,411 --> 01:23:33,640
who just called in. Isn't that
ironic? Isn't it ironic? I don't know.

1346
01:23:33,970 --> 01:23:38,590
I don't even know what irony means
anymore. I don't even know what fucking,

1347
01:23:38,830 --> 01:23:42,520
you know, was that serendipity, you know,

1348
01:23:42,521 --> 01:23:47,230
who ruined irony with the
fucking hipsters? You know,
everything became ironic.

1349
01:23:47,231 --> 01:23:51,880
I'm wearing an ACD, she shirt, but I'm
wearing it ironically. How do you do that?

1350
01:23:51,910 --> 01:23:55,900
How do you wear something?
Ironically, you are wearing it.

1351
01:23:56,050 --> 01:24:01,050
You fuck something ironic about it is
covering your awful on worked out torso.

1352
01:24:03,970 --> 01:24:07,750
I thought irony was, I think I've
discussed this before in podcasts.

1353
01:24:07,780 --> 01:24:11,020
You know what we did and people send me
definitions and I still don't understand

1354
01:24:11,021 --> 01:24:13,380
it.
I thought irony was when the,

1355
01:24:13,690 --> 01:24:18,220
with the fucking fire chief's house
burns to the ground. Isn't that ironic?

1356
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:22,090
Don't you think? Right. And then you
walk around with Atlanta, it's more set.

1357
01:24:23,290 --> 01:24:26,380
You don't want her career went off the
rails is when she did that fucking video

1358
01:24:26,381 --> 01:24:29,350
naked and she had her lung,
uh,

1359
01:24:29,470 --> 01:24:33,280
fucking like, she just
crawled out of that. Well,

1360
01:24:33,281 --> 01:24:36,820
like that chick from the ring when she
had that hair hanging down over a titties

1361
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:40,660
and I don't know what it was.
It was like,

1362
01:24:41,230 --> 01:24:43,990
she had a very pancake

1363
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:47,050
shaped chief.

1364
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:50,710
She looked like a gingerbread
man with long hair and titties.

1365
01:24:53,410 --> 01:24:56,320
That's what I was what you want with
a woman, you want the curves, right.

1366
01:24:56,321 --> 01:24:59,410
That little hourglass thing going on,
you know,

1367
01:24:59,770 --> 01:25:03,310
not to give women a
bad fucking body image.

1368
01:25:03,550 --> 01:25:06,410
Women do so much shit to just fuck
with their own heads. If you ever,

1369
01:25:06,430 --> 01:25:09,220
do you ever talk to a girl and
there'll be like, you're like, hey,

1370
01:25:09,310 --> 01:25:12,010
why don't you get that? That'll
look cool. I can't wear that.

1371
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:17,410
Why can't you wear that cause
cause I'm a spoon. You're a what?

1372
01:25:17,540 --> 01:25:21,520
I'm a spoon. The fuck is a spoon. No,

1373
01:25:21,521 --> 01:25:26,080
that's my body shape. I'm a spoon.
Well why did you just say that?

1374
01:25:26,081 --> 01:25:28,060
Like that was a common term sweetheart.

1375
01:25:28,750 --> 01:25:32,860
And you find out that
they actually go to these,

1376
01:25:32,980 --> 01:25:37,690
these fucking people and they tell
them like what their body shape is.

1377
01:25:37,691 --> 01:25:42,580
And I guess his spoon means you
don't have much in a way of of chest,

1378
01:25:42,850 --> 01:25:46,360
but you have a booty. So that
means you're a spoon. You know,

1379
01:25:46,420 --> 01:25:48,370
if you look to hold the spoon sideways,

1380
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:52,510
evidently that looks like a chick with
an ass. Which I don't think it does.

1381
01:25:53,380 --> 01:25:54,790
Cause personally I am an ass man.

1382
01:25:54,791 --> 01:25:58,600
I've never had the desire to fuck a
spoon even though he eats cereal every

1383
01:25:58,601 --> 01:26:00,790
morning for breakfast.
Okay.

1384
01:26:02,860 --> 01:26:04,100
And if you just titty,

1385
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:09,800
what is that on the capital t?
I can't wear a hoop skirt.

1386
01:26:09,801 --> 01:26:12,020
I'm a capital. I mean I want, I
don't know what the fuck it is.

1387
01:26:12,770 --> 01:26:14,870
They just come up and you know,
I don't know what I am.

1388
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:21,020
Actually one time I actually
looked at myself standing sideways,

1389
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:24,470
completely naked in a mirror,
right?

1390
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:29,680
I was in a hotel and I realized that
I am shaped like the pink panther,

1391
01:26:33,110 --> 01:26:36,650
you know,
Pink Panther as a big head and he's,

1392
01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:40,430
and he's got big feet and they use
his body that just goes straight,

1393
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,760
straight down. That's, that's how
I'm shaped. I like to think my,

1394
01:26:43,761 --> 01:26:48,170
I have better shoulders than the pink
panther, but I don't know, you know,

1395
01:26:48,230 --> 01:26:52,850
that's not for me to judge. That's for
the poor woman who's hooked up with me.

1396
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:56,870
You know what? Fuck this. Let's
get to the podcast questions.

1397
01:26:56,870 --> 01:26:58,610
Why am I telling them you
guys won't looking at myself,

1398
01:26:58,611 --> 01:27:02,540
make it in the fucking man y'all
do with everybody. Does it.

1399
01:27:03,650 --> 01:27:07,040
Um, hey, the elections
tomorrow. By the way, if you're
listening to this on Monday,

1400
01:27:07,940 --> 01:27:12,560
uh, as of tomorrow, um, you know, maybe
we're going to have a new president.

1401
01:27:14,180 --> 01:27:18,560
Bush doesn't declare martial law in the
last second being that's going to come

1402
01:27:18,561 --> 01:27:22,880
down to Florida again and they're
going be trying to count fucking votes.

1403
01:27:24,290 --> 01:27:27,500
I Dunno. I'm really nervous
that they're going to leave,

1404
01:27:27,980 --> 01:27:30,770
that Obama's gonna win and
they're going to leave him

1405
01:27:32,390 --> 01:27:36,770
to try and clean up this unclean
up a bull mess. I don't know.

1406
01:27:36,771 --> 01:27:40,070
It's just too fucking depressing to
think about. I do. Whoever wins. Okay.

1407
01:27:40,490 --> 01:27:40,821
You know what?

1408
01:27:40,821 --> 01:27:44,210
The great thing about this election
is if McCain wins or Obama wins,

1409
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:45,230
at the very least,

1410
01:27:45,231 --> 01:27:48,650
we're going to have a president again
that can actually make a speech without

1411
01:27:48,651 --> 01:27:52,190
you having to look away.
And I think that's good.

1412
01:27:53,540 --> 01:27:54,261
I think that's good.

1413
01:27:54,261 --> 01:27:57,470
Even though they both worked for the
Rothschilds and we're on our way to one

1414
01:27:57,471 --> 01:27:59,480
world government, one World Bank. Fuck.

1415
01:27:59,510 --> 01:28:02,210
I was trying not to say that you guys
seen that commercial out where they're

1416
01:28:02,211 --> 01:28:05,360
going to make it easier for
us to travel between Mexico,

1417
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:07,850
the the Caribbean and Canada.

1418
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:13,590
If we all have enhanced
driver's license, wink, wink,

1419
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:17,300
enhance microchip in it so they can track
your whereabouts cause they're trying

1420
01:28:17,301 --> 01:28:20,240
to get to cherish,
trying to get terrorist.

1421
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:23,480
But I'm trying to see what you're doing.
You're trying to get terrorist. Hey man,

1422
01:28:23,740 --> 01:28:26,480
you ain't doing nothing wrong. He
shouldn't have a fucking problem with it.

1423
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:32,750
People who say that should be processed,
you know,

1424
01:28:32,810 --> 01:28:34,580
I don't think they should
be killed. I, you know,

1425
01:28:34,581 --> 01:28:36,380
I don't know what to do with them.
Should I go with the Hacky,

1426
01:28:36,381 --> 01:28:40,010
stick them on an island and give him
some big fucking cotton candy machine.

1427
01:28:40,660 --> 01:28:43,720
Those, those fucking people in government
can listen to your phone calls. Well,

1428
01:28:43,820 --> 01:28:46,640
if you ain't doing nothing
wrong, Nah, she talking bout

1429
01:28:49,090 --> 01:28:53,020
the government can fuck you in the ass.
Well, Hey, if you got [inaudible] got fat

1430
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:57,470
fucking morons. Yeah, just
keep giving away more rights.

1431
01:28:57,471 --> 01:28:59,870
People just keep doing that,
you know,

1432
01:28:59,871 --> 01:29:03,840
and I'm going to keep bitching about it
as I don't join any groups to prevent it

1433
01:29:03,841 --> 01:29:08,070
or organize or show up at any rallies.
I'm that guy.

1434
01:29:08,610 --> 01:29:09,930
I'm that guy who sits there and goes,
hey,

1435
01:29:09,931 --> 01:29:12,120
you know what the problem is and
then I don't do anything about it.

1436
01:29:12,900 --> 01:29:17,670
I'm an asshole. All right, question number
one of the week. Uh, number one, Bill. Uh,

1437
01:29:17,671 --> 01:29:22,671
we need nicknames and who better to ask
than one of the commentators from the

1438
01:29:23,510 --> 01:29:26,760
race draft the fuck.
Does that mean love the podcast?

1439
01:29:26,761 --> 01:29:28,740
Just thought it would be
something to talk about.

1440
01:29:28,950 --> 01:29:33,950
Well what's the funniest nicknames for
a fighter and what would you name the

1441
01:29:34,681 --> 01:29:39,600
four guys on our main picture?
What,

1442
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:47,430
how do you think he would fare as a
fighter or was a corner man also who's the

1443
01:29:47,431 --> 01:29:48,330
best fighter ever?

1444
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:50,970
I'll answer those last three cause
I don't understand the first.

1445
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:52,710
I mean I'm probably fucking it up.

1446
01:29:52,711 --> 01:29:55,200
I mean sometimes people write
sentences that make sense.

1447
01:29:55,201 --> 01:29:58,500
But I read so poorly that
when I read them out loud,

1448
01:29:58,501 --> 01:30:02,130
I pause and weird areas and then they
don't make sense to me or the listener.

1449
01:30:02,790 --> 01:30:06,540
And it's one of the reasons why I was
never successful when I ran for student

1450
01:30:06,541 --> 01:30:10,080
government. I didn't run
for student government. Um,

1451
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:14,080
I was too busy flunking every class that
I had. I was too busy doing that. Um,

1452
01:30:14,170 --> 01:30:15,900
all right, bill, what are the, let's see.

1453
01:30:18,030 --> 01:30:22,480
How do you think you would fare as a
fighter? I'm into it depends. Toasts.

1454
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:23,940
The other person know how to fight.

1455
01:30:24,580 --> 01:30:27,630
Is that one of those brother to
brother headlock NNGUGI fights?

1456
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:32,040
I always did well in those. Um, how
would I fair as a fighter? I think,

1457
01:30:32,041 --> 01:30:33,940
I think I'm all right.
I ain't tomorrow,

1458
01:30:34,070 --> 01:30:35,430
as long as the other person isn't trained.

1459
01:30:35,431 --> 01:30:37,890
If anybody has any sort of
training or any sort of background,

1460
01:30:38,190 --> 01:30:42,540
I'm fucked because I don't have any
trading and I have a huge head and it's a

1461
01:30:42,541 --> 01:30:47,230
big target. In fact, I was voted most
likely to be assassinated in, uh,

1462
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:52,770
I think I've used that joke before.
I just love that one.

1463
01:30:52,771 --> 01:30:55,770
Anytime you see anything
with a big head in the crowd,

1464
01:30:55,771 --> 01:30:57,240
that's what I always think.
Like you could,

1465
01:30:57,241 --> 01:30:59,100
you wouldn't even need to put
that guy in a convertible.

1466
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:02,220
You could hit them with a slingshot
from the other side of a fucking cotton

1467
01:31:02,580 --> 01:31:07,170
field. Like I actually know the size
of a cotton field like anybody does,

1468
01:31:07,890 --> 01:31:12,010
you know, other even cotton fields
anymore. Did that go out with NAFTA? See,

1469
01:31:12,140 --> 01:31:13,170
what we're gonna do is we're going to,

1470
01:31:13,171 --> 01:31:15,960
we're going to sand a copy and we
have other to pick our continent.

1471
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:20,250
Then we're going to buy the shirts
back from them. Um, anyways,

1472
01:31:21,740 --> 01:31:26,250
how do I think I would fare as a fighter?
I think if somebody is a no background,

1473
01:31:26,490 --> 01:31:30,330
basically angry psycho like me,
I think I can hold my own,

1474
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:33,930
although I'm getting a little
advanced in age, 40 years old,

1475
01:31:33,931 --> 01:31:37,320
wake up with aches and pains.
Um,

1476
01:31:37,410 --> 01:31:42,150
I think I would fare okay
as a professional fighter.
I would not make it out of,

1477
01:31:42,590 --> 01:31:46,050
uh, the cub scouts, whatever
that version is of being a boxer.

1478
01:31:47,100 --> 01:31:49,530
I have a complete inability
to, I don't know, it's wait,

1479
01:31:49,531 --> 01:31:52,260
I have good hand eye coordination.
I can catch things very easily,

1480
01:31:52,261 --> 01:31:55,950
but I'm not fast, which basically means
you can be like, Bill, I'm going to,

1481
01:31:55,951 --> 01:32:00,370
you could tell me what fist you gonna
hit me and what pumps you are going to

1482
01:32:00,371 --> 01:32:04,880
throw an 80% of the time. You'd still
fucking hit me in the head because I,

1483
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:08,710
I don't know. By the time
I, I know what you're doing.

1484
01:32:08,980 --> 01:32:13,960
The only thing I have left to do is
close my eyes and lift my shoulders is if

1485
01:32:13,961 --> 01:32:17,080
that does anything, you know, you know
that move when you're going to get hit,

1486
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:20,650
you have to see that guy. You look away,
close your eyes and lift your shoulders.

1487
01:32:21,130 --> 01:32:23,920
That's always a good day. Why? Why
would you in, why? Why wouldn't,

1488
01:32:23,921 --> 01:32:26,830
why wouldn't you rather lift
your hand up and try to fucking,

1489
01:32:26,831 --> 01:32:31,510
you know how boxes do in block it?
What I do is I close my eyes,

1490
01:32:31,511 --> 01:32:33,040
I looked the other way
and I lift my shoulders.

1491
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:38,440
I'm basically trying to protect my,
from my juggler up to my ear lobe,

1492
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:44,050
but my jaw in my temple and all that
other stuff. That's all for you.

1493
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:49,060
You can have that all day long, baby.
I'm fucking eat it up. All right.

1494
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:53,920
Um, how would I fair as a corner man? Uh,
you know, if you don't know how to fight,

1495
01:32:53,921 --> 01:32:57,400
how can you tell somebody how to
fight and who's the best fighter ever?

1496
01:32:58,220 --> 01:33:02,440
All right. That's some really
speaking in general terms.

1497
01:33:02,441 --> 01:33:05,980
How about my favorite fighter ever?
My favorite fighter ever. We're all,

1498
01:33:05,981 --> 01:33:09,610
all the middleweights from the 80s, except
for Sugar Ray Leonard. I don't know.

1499
01:33:09,611 --> 01:33:14,020
He was just too cute. I like Tommy
Hearns and Marvin Hagler was my favorite.

1500
01:33:14,230 --> 01:33:18,880
I love Roberto Duran. I like,
I love boxing back then.

1501
01:33:18,881 --> 01:33:19,560
Alexis,

1502
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:24,430
are Gwalia Aaron Pryor giving the battle?

1503
01:33:25,270 --> 01:33:30,220
No, the one that I mixed.
Um, that's a fight.

1504
01:33:30,221 --> 01:33:31,540
Fans.
Um,

1505
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:37,270
who else did I like back
then? Larry Holmes. I liked

1506
01:33:39,070 --> 01:33:43,270
Mike Tyson. I love, but he scared the
shit out of me. I like Michael Spinks.

1507
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:48,250
I like Leon spanx. That
was it. There you go.

1508
01:33:48,251 --> 01:33:50,260
Those are the guys I liked.
None of that was funny.

1509
01:33:50,410 --> 01:33:53,650
I'm really boring the shit out of myself.
Okay, let's ratchet up the funny here.

1510
01:33:53,680 --> 01:33:56,980
Number two, Bill, you ever come into,
you ever going to come to Dallas?

1511
01:33:57,490 --> 01:34:00,280
How about this? Are you ever going to
come to the show? When I go to Dallas,

1512
01:34:00,281 --> 01:34:01,540
I go to Dallas every year.

1513
01:34:01,660 --> 01:34:06,580
That's one of my pet fucking peeves is
when people send me fucking emails. Right?

1514
01:34:06,610 --> 01:34:10,750
Like I just got back from Austin and I
got a letter this email this week. Dude,

1515
01:34:10,820 --> 01:34:15,070
you ever coming to Texas?
You know,

1516
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:18,610
just look at my website, I got all the
dates. Okay. And speaking of which,

1517
01:34:18,611 --> 01:34:21,370
I got a slew of dates,
which means a lot.

1518
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:23,710
I have a plethora of dates.

1519
01:34:23,740 --> 01:34:28,030
I have a fuck load of dates coming up then
I'm gonna be putting up on my website,

1520
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:33,160
Bill burg.com and um,
yeah,

1521
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:38,020
I'm going to have a whole bunch of dates
for a January. Um, January, 2009, right?

1522
01:34:38,140 --> 01:34:39,460
Two December,

1523
01:34:39,460 --> 01:34:44,410
2009 or is other people like
to say 2009 and um, Houston,

1524
01:34:44,411 --> 01:34:47,680
Texas is going to be there for all you
fuckers who keep asking me to come to

1525
01:34:47,681 --> 01:34:50,980
Houston even though every time I go there,
11 people show up.

1526
01:34:52,180 --> 01:34:54,790
You guys with your empty
promises, dude, you killed that.

1527
01:34:55,270 --> 01:34:59,630
I'm good to bring 20 and I up and there's
18 fucking people and I'm standing up

1528
01:34:59,631 --> 01:35:04,430
there, you know, feeling
like I'm giving away rubles.

1529
01:35:05,390 --> 01:35:05,840
I'm seriously,

1530
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:08,450
I've got a whole bunch of dates coming
up and I'm going to be posting them and

1531
01:35:08,451 --> 01:35:13,280
I'm, I have a trip to Europe and Australia
in the works in the work. So England,

1532
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:15,620
Sweden, Norway. All right.

1533
01:35:15,621 --> 01:35:20,030
Put on your fucking comedy hats
cause I'm coming your way. And uh,

1534
01:35:20,850 --> 01:35:25,640
also coming to Australia, I believe
next year. Anyways, a, we go,

1535
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:30,980
continuing on the next question,
what do we got here? Uh,
but, but, but the, the, okay,

1536
01:35:30,981 --> 01:35:31,221
bill,

1537
01:35:31,221 --> 01:35:36,080
I subscribed to your podcast on iTunes
since the beginning and you are now over

1538
01:35:36,081 --> 01:35:37,940
a day of talking straight.

1539
01:35:37,941 --> 01:35:42,941
You know what I noticed that I've done
over 24 hours of podcast minutes anyways.

1540
01:35:43,101 --> 01:35:47,600
How is the podcast affected
you since you started it? Um,

1541
01:35:47,630 --> 01:35:48,530
see I just did that.

1542
01:35:49,740 --> 01:35:54,380
The sentence was how has the podcast
affect affected you since you started it?

1543
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:55,580
And I read it this way,

1544
01:35:55,820 --> 01:35:59,720
how has the podcast affected
you since you started it?

1545
01:36:00,260 --> 01:36:02,900
That's exactly how I hit this weird
pause and then I said, oh my God,

1546
01:36:02,901 --> 01:36:05,630
there's another word. Because I
was already thinking of the answer.

1547
01:36:06,110 --> 01:36:10,010
How is it affected me? Um, I don't know.

1548
01:36:10,011 --> 01:36:13,880
I think my ability to talk to myself
on a phone for 40 minutes has really

1549
01:36:13,881 --> 01:36:17,450
improved.
Um,

1550
01:36:17,510 --> 01:36:22,040
it's helped me with my radio show to the
point that I really feel like I could

1551
01:36:22,041 --> 01:36:24,590
do an hour of radio by myself,

1552
01:36:26,270 --> 01:36:29,960
just as long as I wasn't in
a panic state of, oh my God,

1553
01:36:29,961 --> 01:36:32,100
there's nobody else in here.
Oh they get it done.

1554
01:36:32,220 --> 01:36:35,450
Cause that as long as I didn't go to
that place and I just had a couple of

1555
01:36:35,451 --> 01:36:40,451
subjects I can sort of subject
surf through my huge head and uh,

1556
01:36:43,310 --> 01:36:45,590
you know, I think it's
affected me that way. I'm, no,

1557
01:36:45,620 --> 01:36:49,760
maybe I can improv a little bit better
or maybe the standup has helped me,

1558
01:36:49,761 --> 01:36:51,980
I don't know. But, uh,

1559
01:36:51,981 --> 01:36:54,680
I've had a lot of people come up to
me and shows and tell me that they,

1560
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:57,050
now that it's on Itunes, that, you know,

1561
01:36:57,440 --> 01:37:00,080
they listened to it at work or they
have like a designated time when they

1562
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:02,090
listened to it and they've gone back.

1563
01:37:02,090 --> 01:37:06,050
And I had one person tell me one night
they sat there and they listened to like

1564
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:08,750
all the way back to the summertime,

1565
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:11,600
stayed up for like six hours
listening to my podcast,

1566
01:37:11,601 --> 01:37:14,510
which was really flattering because I
think I'm boring as shit a lot of the

1567
01:37:14,511 --> 01:37:17,930
times.
Look at me searching for a compliment now.

1568
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:22,550
It'd be or you're not
boring, blah, blah blah. Um,

1569
01:37:23,510 --> 01:37:25,910
no, I think it's been a great
thing and it's something that, uh,

1570
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,880
last week when I did the very
special one and I had Joe to Rosa,

1571
01:37:28,881 --> 01:37:32,690
I think I'm going to be doing more
of those. I enjoy, uh, I don't know.

1572
01:37:32,691 --> 01:37:35,750
I like working with other people in
problem with them fucking around.

1573
01:37:36,390 --> 01:37:40,880
And if I could figure out
a way to block my, uh,

1574
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:42,620
my podcasts,

1575
01:37:42,621 --> 01:37:46,340
maybe I could do one where I could
actually call someone a regular listener

1576
01:37:47,870 --> 01:37:50,200
or have somebody call in.
I don't know how the fuck I could do it,

1577
01:37:50,201 --> 01:37:51,440
but then it would just be awkward.

1578
01:37:52,460 --> 01:37:54,980
I always feel like that those
things never live up to the,

1579
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:56,460
someone's like all excited.

1580
01:37:56,461 --> 01:37:59,670
And then it just turns into that
myth that Chris Farley character,

1581
01:37:59,671 --> 01:38:02,190
they used to do,
you know,

1582
01:38:02,220 --> 01:38:06,550
the really bad interviewer or he would
just be like interviewing Paul Mccartney.

1583
01:38:06,630 --> 01:38:10,170
You'd be like, remember, remember,
remember the time when it's time you guys,

1584
01:38:10,171 --> 01:38:14,850
you guys did the the sergeant pepper
pepper album and then Paul Mccartney,

1585
01:38:14,851 --> 01:38:17,610
he's like, yeah, yeah, I
do remember that night.

1586
01:38:17,970 --> 01:38:21,030
And he just feel like that was awesome.

1587
01:38:21,540 --> 01:38:24,810
Like I worry that it will just become
that like a fucking staring contest. I,

1588
01:38:24,811 --> 01:38:27,030
you know, I actually worry,
I worry that would actually,

1589
01:38:27,450 --> 01:38:31,800
the podcast would be as bad as
the awful recreation of that.

1590
01:38:31,801 --> 01:38:35,730
Chris Farley bit. Did you like my really
bad English accent than I did in there?

1591
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:40,020
It was so bad that I literally had
to throw in mate at the end of it.

1592
01:38:40,021 --> 01:38:43,350
So you would know that Oh,
he is doing an English accent.

1593
01:38:43,351 --> 01:38:48,030
I thought he just raised his
voice an octave. Okay, let's,

1594
01:38:48,031 --> 01:38:50,760
let's plow ahead. Okay. Bill. Um,

1595
01:38:50,761 --> 01:38:53,580
you should start writing a
book on your stadium travels.

1596
01:38:53,581 --> 01:38:58,560
You can give yourself the excuse that
you're doing it to make money. Oh yeah.

1597
01:38:58,561 --> 01:39:02,730
Rather than being a loser and
get on that new sports soup show,

1598
01:39:02,820 --> 01:39:05,310
you would be excellent on it. Um, yeah.

1599
01:39:05,311 --> 01:39:07,950
For those of you who weren't listening in
the past couple of weeks, I'm actually,

1600
01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:12,210
um, I'm not going home for
the holidays. Thanksgiving,

1601
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:15,840
I'm not going home on Christmas
and I'm not working new year's.

1602
01:39:15,841 --> 01:39:19,100
I'm tapping out fuck the masses.

1603
01:39:19,730 --> 01:39:23,610
I'm taking a break and instead
I'm actually going to Calgary,

1604
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:28,640
Edmonton and Vancouver with a buddy of
mine and we're gonna [inaudible] you

1605
01:39:29,431 --> 01:39:30,560
know,
I'm going to go,

1606
01:39:30,780 --> 01:39:35,780
go fucking go to some hockey games and
get absolutely shit faced with their

1607
01:39:36,211 --> 01:39:38,910
extra alcohol beer.
And um,

1608
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:42,960
I said I'm going to do and
people have called me a fag,

1609
01:39:44,010 --> 01:39:48,570
you know, doing, how are
you doing that? You know,

1610
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:51,150
that kind of stuff. But I
don't care. I like doing it,

1611
01:39:51,151 --> 01:39:55,770
but I know I'm also a psycho when it
comes to, I have like OCD, like big time.

1612
01:39:55,771 --> 01:40:00,330
Like I've so gotten into hockey that I
just ordered the NHL package and I am

1613
01:40:00,331 --> 01:40:03,810
literally watching like three
hockey games a night. Like,

1614
01:40:03,811 --> 01:40:08,070
I watch what the one hockey game that
interests me and then I take two others

1615
01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:13,200
and then I watch him like literally
like a fucking assistant coach. And uh,

1616
01:40:13,201 --> 01:40:17,910
I dunno, I've been thinking about doing
like a book on it, but you know something,

1617
01:40:18,060 --> 01:40:21,150
the whole reason why I became a comedian
is cause I don't want to have a job.

1618
01:40:21,180 --> 01:40:24,240
I don't want to do work.
I just want to do this.

1619
01:40:24,241 --> 01:40:26,040
Like I don't prepare for these podcasts.

1620
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:29,850
I just laid out on the bed and
I run my fucking mouth for 45.

1621
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:32,190
That's how I like doing shit.
I don't like rehearsing.

1622
01:40:32,550 --> 01:40:34,200
I don't like organizing shit.

1623
01:40:34,650 --> 01:40:38,430
I don't like coming up with
business models and you know,

1624
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:41,890
I don't want to write a book about
my stadium Shit. I just want to,

1625
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:46,410
I just want to go to him and
get drunk and talk to some,

1626
01:40:46,890 --> 01:40:51,600
the oldest guy I can find with the oldest
looking Jersey of the team and to ask

1627
01:40:51,601 --> 01:40:55,600
them, what was it like years ago when you
went to the fucking stadium? You know,

1628
01:40:55,630 --> 01:40:59,290
like I love going to Pittsburgh
and talking to fucking, you know,

1629
01:40:59,291 --> 01:41:02,410
the guy driving me from the airport.
I look at it, I'm like, okay,

1630
01:41:02,411 --> 01:41:06,880
that guy's like in his 50s. So that means
30 years ago he was in his twenties.

1631
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:08,980
If I was in my twenties in Pittsburgh,

1632
01:41:09,010 --> 01:41:12,640
I would've gone to three rivers stadium
and I would've watched Franco, Terri,

1633
01:41:13,150 --> 01:41:16,300
Lynn Swann and all those guys. And I
asked him, do you ever go over there?

1634
01:41:16,301 --> 01:41:18,490
And he'd be, ah, yeah,
it was fucking awesome.

1635
01:41:18,491 --> 01:41:23,260
And then you hear these great stories.
I was at that game, Fred Bulletin,

1636
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:26,910
the cough and the Raiders and yeah,
you can just, I know whatever.

1637
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:31,030
I'm a fucking nerd. Okay, next
question. I noticed the trend.

1638
01:41:31,031 --> 01:41:34,870
You have a loving to rag on
either crazy or stupid people.

1639
01:41:36,580 --> 01:41:40,680
Um, oh Geez. Aren't you perceptive? Well,

1640
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:44,010
I notice you're kind of angry. I'm
going to go out on a limb here. Um,

1641
01:41:44,130 --> 01:41:44,801
because of this.

1642
01:41:44,801 --> 01:41:49,801
I was wondering how you feel about Sarah
Palin given the fact that she is both

1643
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:53,560
of these things crazy and stupid.
I don't think she's stupid.

1644
01:41:53,561 --> 01:41:58,270
I just think she's not ready.
You know,

1645
01:41:58,271 --> 01:42:00,670
I think she's really green.
You know what I mean?

1646
01:42:00,671 --> 01:42:04,960
She's more comes off as
somebody David Letterman would,

1647
01:42:04,961 --> 01:42:07,480
would talk to in a bit,
you know,

1648
01:42:07,510 --> 01:42:11,440
because they make their own jam and
they put it in a jar. I'll tell you why.

1649
01:42:11,441 --> 01:42:13,300
You know what,
I really don't like.

1650
01:42:13,301 --> 01:42:18,301
I don't like how a Bama and John Mccain
and all these fucking guys are like on

1651
01:42:18,581 --> 01:42:21,820
ESPN and they're going
on Saturday night live.

1652
01:42:22,590 --> 01:42:26,770
And I think it really trivializes what
they're doing. You know what I mean?

1653
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:27,910
I think,
uh,

1654
01:42:28,380 --> 01:42:31,300
that they should be on shows like meet
the press and they should be doing

1655
01:42:31,301 --> 01:42:34,270
debates. And I think
that, you know, you know,

1656
01:42:34,271 --> 01:42:36,100
you're not supposed to
combine church and state.

1657
01:42:36,130 --> 01:42:40,330
I don't think you should combine political
figures and sketch comedy shows that

1658
01:42:40,331 --> 01:42:44,410
make fun of them. And then
they go on there and they're
all in on the joke, like,

1659
01:42:44,411 --> 01:42:46,240
yeah, yeah, I'm a fucking idiot.

1660
01:42:47,560 --> 01:42:50,920
That doesn't really make me confidence.
And either Mccain,

1661
01:42:50,921 --> 01:42:55,150
Obama and uh, you know, I don't know.

1662
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:57,520
I gotta I gotta tell you something though.

1663
01:42:57,521 --> 01:43:01,240
I really want to get a John Mccain shirt
and just wear it around La just because

1664
01:43:01,270 --> 01:43:05,890
I love annoying people, you know? And uh,

1665
01:43:05,950 --> 01:43:06,511
you know,
I,

1666
01:43:06,511 --> 01:43:11,511
I just think that would be funny just to
have people that Christ is fucking guy.

1667
01:43:12,970 --> 01:43:17,530
This John Mccain. Shit, man, if I have
shut up, why don't you just shut up?

1668
01:43:17,531 --> 01:43:19,720
Why don't you stop and I just
want to see me people's noses.

1669
01:43:19,721 --> 01:43:24,520
I can get to wrinkle, um, about say
right now, I'm gonna tell you I'm,

1670
01:43:24,521 --> 01:43:29,080
I'm voting for Ron Paul. I'm voting
for Ron Paul and I don't give a fuck.

1671
01:43:29,170 --> 01:43:32,710
I vote for guys from here on out
who questioned the Federal Reserve.

1672
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:35,810
And other than that, if you
don't do that, then you're,

1673
01:43:35,811 --> 01:43:40,060
you're just another company guy and I
have no use for you. Alright. Underrated.

1674
01:43:40,061 --> 01:43:43,030
Overrated. Um, somebody said, oh,

1675
01:43:43,031 --> 01:43:46,960
look at this underrated Doug Davidoff.
And uh,

1676
01:43:46,961 --> 01:43:51,100
I believe that he's in my top 80 friends
there in the page. Hilarious comedian.

1677
01:43:51,110 --> 01:43:54,710
This person says he's underrated.
He's a great and really under,

1678
01:43:54,950 --> 01:43:59,480
under the radar comedian.
So check out Doug Davidoff everybody.

1679
01:44:00,590 --> 01:44:03,860
Um, and this is, I love this
one. Underrated the cable guy.

1680
01:44:04,850 --> 01:44:08,450
It was a good movie. You
know what? I love that movie.

1681
01:44:09,350 --> 01:44:14,350
I think there's just one
too many music montage this,

1682
01:44:15,290 --> 01:44:19,610
you know what I mean? But I have to
admit that I downloaded that song,

1683
01:44:20,390 --> 01:44:25,220
uh, that hey man, nice shot when
a Jim Carrey goes up, you know,

1684
01:44:25,221 --> 01:44:28,510
dressed old school with the short shorts
and the, does he have a headband on?

1685
01:44:28,530 --> 01:44:31,010
Anyways, he puts in the mouth
guard and he's playing basketball,

1686
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:35,420
but there's just one too many of those.
But I love that movie.

1687
01:44:35,421 --> 01:44:37,310
I thought it was really
dark and really creepy,

1688
01:44:38,030 --> 01:44:39,710
which is probably why
it didn't do as well.

1689
01:44:39,711 --> 01:44:44,180
It didn't perform as well at the box
office as they want it to because people

1690
01:44:44,181 --> 01:44:48,440
like to go to the movie theater
and forget their problems. Um,

1691
01:44:48,470 --> 01:44:51,440
overrated. Splenda, it's disgusting.

1692
01:44:52,850 --> 01:44:54,380
What the fuck is Splenda again?

1693
01:44:54,381 --> 01:44:57,980
Is that that stuff that makes Doritos
not make you fat but your athletes?

1694
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:04,460
Is that what that is? Um, overrated.
Pink Floyd prison tee shirts.

1695
01:45:05,480 --> 01:45:08,240
Uh, it's a great one. I
Love Pink Floyd, but there,

1696
01:45:08,420 --> 01:45:12,740
there are way too many dumb teenagers
wearing that shirt that don't know what

1697
01:45:12,741 --> 01:45:16,910
the hell it is. Now I have to ask you
a question person who wrote that in.

1698
01:45:17,450 --> 01:45:19,130
When you say they don't know what that is,

1699
01:45:19,131 --> 01:45:22,430
do you mean they don't really know what
pink Floyd is or they don't know what

1700
01:45:22,431 --> 01:45:24,110
the Prizm is?
Cause I got to tell you,

1701
01:45:24,140 --> 01:45:28,340
I've owned dark side of the moon forever
and I don't know what the prison means

1702
01:45:28,341 --> 01:45:28,820
either.

1703
01:45:28,820 --> 01:45:33,740
I didn't even know what a prison is
other than a triangle that makes you go,

1704
01:45:33,741 --> 01:45:38,120
wow man. Look at the colors
and freaking out. Um,

1705
01:45:38,660 --> 01:45:41,480
I do have to tell you this. I uh, let me,

1706
01:45:41,481 --> 01:45:45,320
let me check the time of the podcast
here. 28 minutes. That's decent.

1707
01:45:45,321 --> 01:45:48,530
We're going to wrap this up at
about 30. That's a good one. Um,

1708
01:45:49,640 --> 01:45:53,540
one of the best musical experiences
I ever had was I bought pink Floyd.

1709
01:45:54,620 --> 01:45:58,820
God Damn it, the phone's ringing.
And who's this? Greg Fitzsimmons.

1710
01:45:59,210 --> 01:46:01,220
Hang on a second.
Greg Fitzsimmons.

1711
01:46:03,230 --> 01:46:05,660
Hello Gregory.

1712
01:46:09,100 --> 01:46:10,760
Oh wait a minute.
He pocket dialed me.

1713
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:12,650
Let me listen to see if
he's talking about me.

1714
01:46:16,810 --> 01:46:20,270
No, he's not. No such luck. That's
like an, you know what? And now he's,

1715
01:46:20,500 --> 01:46:22,130
he's gonna call me back like 19 times,

1716
01:46:22,310 --> 01:46:26,120
cause I'm the last guy he calls and
every time he reaches over to scratch his

1717
01:46:26,121 --> 01:46:26,781
right ball,

1718
01:46:26,781 --> 01:46:30,770
his left ball is going to hit send on
his cell phone and he's gonna call me.

1719
01:46:31,460 --> 01:46:34,220
Anyways, getting back
to the, uh, pink Floyd,

1720
01:46:34,280 --> 01:46:38,650
a musical experience, I bought that, uh,

1721
01:46:38,900 --> 01:46:40,460
I believe on cassette tape

1722
01:46:42,620 --> 01:46:47,620
and I had headphones just like in dazed
and confused and I listened to that in

1723
01:46:47,721 --> 01:46:49,260
the dark for the first time.

1724
01:46:49,310 --> 01:46:52,860
This is for all you youngsters out there
who are not jaded and as long as you

1725
01:46:52,861 --> 01:46:54,520
haven't watched his
face as a death around,

1726
01:46:54,540 --> 01:46:57,330
that type of shit is
still relatively innocent.

1727
01:46:57,660 --> 01:47:01,470
Like I was back then pre internet days,
even though the Internet existed,

1728
01:47:01,471 --> 01:47:03,210
but it only existed for fucking nerds.

1729
01:47:03,690 --> 01:47:07,860
I listened to that album in the dark and
that album scared the living shit out

1730
01:47:07,861 --> 01:47:10,290
of me.
It's incredible music.

1731
01:47:10,470 --> 01:47:15,300
But that shit with people running down
the halls in heartbeats and all that type

1732
01:47:15,301 --> 01:47:17,820
of crap, that really, really
scared the hell out of me.

1733
01:47:17,821 --> 01:47:22,580
And it's a fucking masterpiece. So if
you get a chance, get some headphones,

1734
01:47:22,670 --> 01:47:27,360
if he can buy it on vinyl, off of Ebay,
you know, you don't even need drugs.

1735
01:47:27,450 --> 01:47:31,170
That's how good pink Floyd
is. And a, and there you go.

1736
01:47:32,040 --> 01:47:36,870
All right. The original pink
pink Floyd and I got a question.

1737
01:47:36,990 --> 01:47:38,100
Would you guys won't
let anybody out there?

1738
01:47:38,101 --> 01:47:39,870
Would you like to hook
up with that girl pink?

1739
01:47:41,220 --> 01:47:42,760
There's something really hot about her,

1740
01:47:42,761 --> 01:47:47,430
but then she's also kind of building
a fullback like, you know, like she,

1741
01:47:47,431 --> 01:47:50,850
I don't know
not to use the classic.

1742
01:47:50,850 --> 01:47:55,830
I think she rip your Dick
off man. Uh, anyways,

1743
01:47:55,831 --> 01:47:58,330
that's the podcast for this
week. Half Hour. There you go.

1744
01:47:58,490 --> 01:47:59,850
I'm fun to trim it back a little bit.

1745
01:48:00,360 --> 01:48:05,220
He's podcasts will becoming a little too
long, kind of like jam band shit. Um,

1746
01:48:05,730 --> 01:48:09,750
so anyways, I'm going to be at the
Improv in Washington DC this week.

1747
01:48:11,160 --> 01:48:14,760
Uh, the eighth ninth, I
can't even fucking read it.

1748
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:20,280
No, the sixth, seventh,
and 8th of November. And

1749
01:48:22,110 --> 01:48:25,020
uh, the following week I'm going to
be uninformed, told with Joe de Rosa.

1750
01:48:25,021 --> 01:48:28,770
Once again,
we'll be at Nashville's Nashville,

1751
01:48:29,210 --> 01:48:33,060
comedies A's in Nashville.

1753
01:48:37,801 --> 01:48:39,120

appearances and then click the link.

1755
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:49,020
Please keep the questions coming. Please
keep underrated, overrated coming.

1756
01:48:49,021 --> 01:48:50,700
And please answer my question.

1757
01:48:50,730 --> 01:48:55,590
What a prison is and what the fuck it is.
Whatever that triangle is,

1758
01:48:56,130 --> 01:48:57,330
I don't fucking know.
All right,

1759
01:48:57,331 --> 01:49:01,350
now I've got a headache and I've
lost total momentum on this podcast.

1760
01:49:01,351 --> 01:49:05,700
It's not funny anymore and it
needs to fucking stop. All right,

1761
01:49:05,940 --> 01:49:07,400
everybody go out and vote tomorrow.

1762
01:49:08,160 --> 01:49:11,370
Go with your gut and actually
try to read the questions.

1763
01:49:11,430 --> 01:49:13,890
That's what I'm going to do today.
You know those stupid little signs.

1764
01:49:13,891 --> 01:49:18,891
People have full know an eight man
and then you keep a running tally.

1765
01:49:19,321 --> 01:49:21,840
Wow. Everybody keeps saying
vote nos and then you vote no,

1766
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:25,920
and you read that little paragraph.
Can anybody explain to me why those,

1767
01:49:25,950 --> 01:49:28,230
when they have those questions,
it's never clear.

1768
01:49:28,710 --> 01:49:33,450
It's always no means yes and yes means
no. You know what I mean? It's like, why?

1769
01:49:33,451 --> 01:49:36,810
Why can't they just fucking just
say what the questions mean?

1770
01:49:37,620 --> 01:49:39,840
Why can't we just live in
a perfect world? Hey, bill,

1771
01:49:39,990 --> 01:49:42,780
why don't you just shut the fuck
up and in the podcast? All right.

1772
01:49:42,781 --> 01:49:47,170
That's what I'm going to do. I'll talk
to you guys next Monday. Um, that is it.

1773
01:49:47,171 --> 01:49:51,940
God bless all of you. And a day, the time
next week we'll have a new president.

1774
01:49:52,060 --> 01:49:56,650
Isn't that exciting? Someone who
could make a speech. All right.

1775
01:49:56,740 --> 01:49:59,650
Who are you voting for? The white
guy or the off white guy. Thank you.

1776
01:49:59,740 --> 01:50:03,700
I'll be at the fucking DC Improv this
week. Please come out to the show.

1777
01:50:03,930 --> 01:50:04,880
All right.
Motherfuckers

1778
01:50:06,090 --> 01:50:06,651
sit and have a good week.

1779
01:50:06,651 --> 01:50:11,651
So

1780
01:50:27,940 --> 01:50:28,773

1781
01:51:03,780 --> 01:51:04,613
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1782
01:51:53,020 --> 01:51:53,853
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1783
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:49,840
cat.
