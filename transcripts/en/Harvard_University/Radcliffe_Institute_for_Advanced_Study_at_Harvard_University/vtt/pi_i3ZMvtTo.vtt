00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.350
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.180
- Thank you.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.290
Wow, well, it's an honor to
be here at Radcliffe this year

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.320
and to interact with all
the other amazing fellows.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.810
And in fact, the thing that's
the most painful about it

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.090
is not being able
to do everything.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.330
So it's wonderful and terrible
to be talking to you about

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.070
elections today, right after
an election that's going

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.190
to take a while to understand.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.330
So let me plunge right in
and start with the preface.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.010
It's November 7.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.980
What just happened?

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.980
Part of the answer
is I don't totally

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.230
know yet what my
story will be in terms

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.940
of how to think
about it, but I want

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.350
to take a moment to highlight
some non-candidate outcomes

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.870
that may have been
under the radar for you.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.270
There were many.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.840
I'm particularly excited
that here in Massachusetts

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.790
by an emphatic margin we
upheld anti-discrimination laws

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:02.570
for trans people.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.502
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.120
Florida-- complicated
in other ways--

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.230
emphatically voted yes to
restore voting rights for most

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.331
people with felony convictions.

00:01:17.331 --> 00:01:19.295
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.390
Arkansas and Missouri
voted emphatically again

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.510
to raise their minimum
wage substantially.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.214
Medicaid expansion in states
you might not expect it.

00:01:30.214 --> 00:01:35.180
And real modernization
of registration policies

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.440
in Maryland and Nevada
and in Michigan.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.390
And redistricting reform
seems to have won everywhere

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.930
it appeared.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.560
Although, Utah is particularly
slow to count its votes.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.470
So this brings me
to the topic that I

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:49.620
want to talk about today.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.340
What's going on in
US redistricting?

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.440
How can we-- how are
we making progress?

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.560
What are the inroads in
understanding redistricting

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.741
and how to do it better?

00:01:59.741 --> 00:02:04.230
OK, so I think what I'll
do, what I'll definitely do,

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.690
is invert maybe the
usual logic of a talk.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.729
Usually, you start
with the overview,

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.820
and then you give your
kind of detailed work.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.060
I'm going to go backwards and
start with the math problem

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.490
and come to the
overview afterwards.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.140
So here we go.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.890
Here's the redistricting,
seen through the lens

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.230
of mathematics.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.020
So the power the power
that comes with the ability

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.580
to draw the lines, that's
what we want to understand.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.560
So let's do the
very simplest model.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.400
So in this picture,
you see five districts.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.930
And I've drawn in
the 50/50 line.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.560
And let's suppose that
a state is made up

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.860
of two kinds of voters, pink
voters and orange voters.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.290
And what we'd like
to do is understand

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.384
if we have complete
omniscience and omnipotence,

00:02:50.384 --> 00:02:52.800
and we can put those voters
into districts, if we can just

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.174
sort them out at will,
with only the rule

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:57.090
that there should be an
equal number of voters

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.500
in each district,
what can we do?

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.000
Well, it turns out we can do an
extraordinary amount in terms

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.410
of controlling the outcome.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.100
Orange can get no representation
with 40% of the vote,

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.830
or it can get 80% of
the representation.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.200
So here are two pictures
that illustrate that.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.630
So there is the same kind
of volume of orange vote,

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.200
40%, in both pictures, or
maybe 40% plus epsilon.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.810
And you can see that, on
the left, because orange

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.130
has 40% of every district,
orange gets no representation.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.316
Is the schematic clear?

00:03:31.316 --> 00:03:33.380
OK, and on the other
hand, if orange

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.000
is able to arrange matters
extremely efficiently, then

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.600
that 40% can be converted into
four seats out of five or 80%

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.216
of the representation.

00:03:43.216 --> 00:03:46.390
OK, so at the outset we--

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.310
you know, at first
blush, we should

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.510
be kind of in awe of how
much control you have

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.840
when you get to
organize the lines.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.850
But maybe this seems like a
vastly oversimplified model

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.520
because, in fact, you don't get
to pick people up and put them

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.980
in buckets that the
districts represent.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.830
Instead, there's geography.

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:06.820
There's demography.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.180
There's all kinds of
complications and rules

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.980
that delimit the problem.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.700
And I'll come to that, but
let's stay simple for a moment.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.660
So the way that you can get
such an extreme advantage

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.780
is with two kind of
venerated strategies called

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.690
packing and cracking.

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.560
And what those mean is this.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.340
Packing is when you take the
power to draw the lines--

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.340
in this case, orange has the
power to draw the lines--

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.460
and you take the
other side, here pink,

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.730
and stuff them into a few
districts with wastefully high

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.050
vote totals and
then disperse them

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.460
over the remaining districts.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.980
So packing is
overstuffed districts.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.740
And cracking is when
you have substantial,

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.990
what some have
called wasted votes,

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.207
because there are a lot
of votes being cast,

00:04:54.207 --> 00:04:56.290
but they're not being
converted to representation.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:57.395
They're dispersed.

00:04:57.395 --> 00:05:01.770
All right, and in
the other picture,

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.220
it's orange that's been cracked.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.720
Right?

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.350
So these are kind of the
hallmarks of strategies

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.380
to extract extra
advantage from the ability

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.230
to control the lines.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:17.992
OK, the next thing to note
is that the outcome doesn't

00:05:17.992 --> 00:05:19.450
tell you everything
about what it's

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.240
like to live and vote
in a society that's

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.690
structured this way.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.750
So here are two
different ways of getting

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.000
proportional
representation for orange--

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.650
two seats out of five or
40% of the representation.

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:38.950
But in one world, it's a little
bit more randomly aggregated.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.200
And in the other
world, you live only

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.371
with people who vote like you.

00:05:43.371 --> 00:05:43.870
Right?

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.640
And it's an open
question which is

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.460
sort of a healthier
democratic state of affairs,

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.420
but we can look
at how tendencies

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:57.622
have been trending in the US
and think about what that means.

00:05:57.622 --> 00:06:02.410
OK, next point to
make, we have thought--

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.700
it's been a kind of idea
that's as old as the word

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.260
gerrymander, which
I'll return to,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.640
that bad shapes, that
eccentrically shaped districts

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.580
are really telling us that
something nefarious is going.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.430
Some agenda is being advanced.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.860
And I actually want to speak
against that narrative,

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.630
somewhat, because
what I want to argue

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.120
is that, if you
see the shapes, you

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.660
don't know the story that
they're telling unless you

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.780
see what's underneath.

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:31.610
Right?

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.270
And so it's not the shapes
of the district themselves.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.930
It's how they slice up
the people that tells us

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:44.210
how the outcome turns out
and that ultimately tells us

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:49.112
about the quality of
the districting plan.

00:06:49.112 --> 00:06:52.840
OK, so let's look at some
of the math up close,

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.580
and we'll start with
a very toy example.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.360
Instead of a big
complicated city or state,

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.780
suppose I want to redistrict
just a 4 x 4 grid.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:06.600
So what you see here is
all 22 ways to do that.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.100
Right?

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.570
So in each of these pictures,
I've taken a 4 x 4 grid,

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.250
and I've cut it
into four districts.

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:17.190
I've sort of Tetris decomposed,
right, the 4 x 4 grid.

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:20.090
So they're 22 ways to do that.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.750
But that's up to symmetry.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:25.180
If I take some of these, and
I rotate them and flip them,

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:29.120
I get 117 different
ways to do so.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.070
And that's it.

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:32.450
That's all there are.

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:36.040
But that's already a
fairly complicated world

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.650
to navigate if you're trying
to understand the possibility

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.650
space of districting plans.

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:45.210
And it rapidly gets out of hand.

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:49.010
Here's the actual current
state of knowledge,

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.950
which is fairly
appalling, when it comes

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:55.310
to the combinatorics
or the number of ways

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:57.620
to redistrict even
these small grids.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.930
So here's what you're
seeing in this picture.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:06.350
That 4 x 4 grid being
districted into 117 ways

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:10.060
is shown here because those
were equal sized districtings.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:13.580
And by getting multiple
different algorithms at work

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:16.110
on some of the fastest
computers available,

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:18.434
this is how far we've
been able to get.

00:08:18.434 --> 00:08:21.980
So the numbers rise
fairly rapidly.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.470
By the time you want to
redistrict a 9 x 9 grid,

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:27.985
there are 700 trillion
ways to do it.

00:08:27.985 --> 00:08:30.110
I would tell you how many
ways there are to do a 10

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:32.270
by 10 grid, but
that calculation has

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:34.250
been running on the
OpenStack machines

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.750
at MIT for over a month
without terminating.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:39.650
So you know, the
sea of ignorance

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:42.624
here is pretty startling.

00:08:42.624 --> 00:08:47.270
But of course, states are
unimaginably bigger than this.

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:49.360
So the problem is
that, if you want

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:53.500
to understand the landscape
of ways to do redistricting,

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.540
I would say that one
of the challenges,

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.850
historically, in
approaching redistricting

00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:59.680
is that that
possibility space is way

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.730
too large to think about.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:04.445
So let's say you want to
redistrict Pennsylvania.

00:09:04.445 --> 00:09:06.820
You have its census blocks,
and you want to break them up

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:08.380
into 18 districts.

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.220
How many ways to do that?

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.300
Well, if you started
to enumerate this

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.610
at 1 microsecond
per plan, it would

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:18.760
take until after the heat
death of the universe

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.409
to get to your response.

00:09:20.409 --> 00:09:21.700
You're just not going to do it.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:26.180
This is outside the
realm of what is doable.

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:29.120
The good news is-- and here's
a little piece of magic.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:32.430
You heard a bit from Meredith
about my dissertation,

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:34.410
which it's true was
about Teichmuller space.

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:37.040
In fact, what I did in
my dissertation was study

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:43.370
random walks on a space of
surfaces, a 6, 12, 18, 24,

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:45.960
30-dimensional
space of surfaces.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.230
And the question was, if
you start to modify things

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:50.450
randomly, and you do that
for a long time, what

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:52.350
are the long-term trends.

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:55.040
Well, in what feels to
me like a piece of magic,

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.960
that same kind of
mathematics comes

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.015
to bear on the
redistricting problem.

00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:01.160
So here's what we'll do.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:05.120
We can't build out the whole
space of possible districting

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.040
plans, but we can study it.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.540
We can sample it at random.

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:11.390
We can do random walks
in the space of plans.

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:12.860
So that's what I
want to show you.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:16.190
OK, so I want to walk
around in this space

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:18.230
that I can't fully see.

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:19.910
So I have to start somewhere.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:22.910
First, I need a way to
make an initial plan.

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:27.620
So there are lots of ways
to do this, but one of them

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:31.340
was, until recently,
displayed in the art gallery

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:33.180
over in Byerly.

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:36.230
You can take a
spanning tree approach

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:41.060
and just form a spanning tree
at random, whatever that is--

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.200
I'll show you pictures of
one a little bit later--

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.110
and then split off districts
of about equal size from it.

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:49.730
And you get these bewitching
beautiful neutral districting

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:51.500
plans.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:55.140
Under the hood, there are
fun computing algorithms

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.510
for doing this for, building
these spanning trees.

00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:58.830
And they have great properties.

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:00.990
There's something called
Wilson's algorithm

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:05.820
that can sample uniformly from
the space of spanning trees

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:07.090
and do it really fast.

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:09.230
And here's a kind
of image of how,

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:11.850
if you color code
the individual steps,

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:15.540
how you're winding
around a space like this.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.930
OK, so we've got
some way of starting

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:19.820
with districting plans.

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:21.650
And then here's the protocol.

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:24.350
Just start modifying
them at random.

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.210
You apply some kind
of proposal that

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:29.300
tells you how to transform
one plan to a different plan.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:30.740
And what you're
effectively doing

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:34.250
is walking around the
space of possibilities.

00:11:37.512 --> 00:11:40.520
OK, so that's what you see
happening in this picture.

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.680
It's computationally very light.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.440
This is a capture of
an in-browser demo.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.360
Your computer can
do this randomly.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.760
It's extremely light computing.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:54.920
But it turns out that one of
the research innovations that

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:59.000
has come out of our group
in the last few weeks

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.910
has been a much more efficient
way to do it than this.

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:05.480
So here again, I'm going to
use this term spanning tree.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.990
And let me show you the
picture of how to do it.

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:10.190
At the side, you
see the process.

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:13.950
On top, I start with two
districts, the orange and teal.

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:16.880
And I'm going to do a move
I call a recombination.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:18.350
And that's by
analogy with biology,

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:20.120
all right, where you're
taking some things

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.290
and glomming them together
splitting them back up.

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:24.000
And that's like what
we're going to do here.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.541
So we start with
these two districts.

00:12:25.541 --> 00:12:26.590
We merge them.

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:29.130
We draw this random
spanning tree.

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:34.620
So that's a network with no
cycles that visits every node.

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.860
And then I look one by
one at the edges of that.

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:38.750
And I ask, if I cut
this edge, will I

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:41.610
get pieces of equal size.

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:44.310
If there's no way to do that,
I pick a new tree and proceed.

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:46.550
So all of this can be
done efficiently, quickly,

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:47.550
at random.

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:49.760
And then I cut at
a balanced place,

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.479
and I get a new
pair of districts.

00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:52.520
Does that make any sense?

00:12:55.448 --> 00:12:57.572
Good, so let's
see how they work.

00:12:57.572 --> 00:12:58.780
I'm going to illustrate this.

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:01.165
Here's of course Pennsylvania.

00:13:01.165 --> 00:13:03.220
And here are two
grids where I just

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:07.330
want to show you the dynamical
system of these random walks

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:09.140
and what it looks like.

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:10.960
So I've started
the process on top.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.020
And in both of them, I began
with an initial splitting

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:15.860
into these column districts.

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.582
Everybody with me?

00:13:17.582 --> 00:13:20.716
And then we're mutating
the districts flip by flip.

00:13:20.716 --> 00:13:22.340
And what I want you
to think about here

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:25.756
is blind exploration
of an unseen space.

00:13:25.756 --> 00:13:27.380
You've dropped down,
and you've started

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:29.487
making moves at random
without knowing much

00:13:29.487 --> 00:13:30.320
about the landscape.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.072
All right?

00:13:32.072 --> 00:13:34.340
OK, as I talk, I'm
letting this run,

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:36.910
and you see it
really is changing,

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:39.050
but it hasn't forgotten
that it used to be columns.

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:40.310
Do you see that?

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:44.140
It's got the memory
of its initial seed.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.520
I was giving it a
big head start so

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:51.205
that I could try to impress you
with the efficacy of this walk.

00:13:51.205 --> 00:13:53.540
So this is this new
recombination move.

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:56.330
It locomotes much
more efficiently

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.380
around the space
of possibilities.

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:01.640
And we have really good evidence
that, after just a short amount

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.640
of time, it can sample
representatively

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.300
from this unthinkably big space.

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.020
That's big progress, and
I'm scientifically very

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:10.410
excited about it.

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:13.870
And here it is on Pennsylvania.

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:18.174
So this is a recombination
random walk of Pennsylvania.

00:14:18.174 --> 00:14:20.090
OK, and that's a little
bit of the mathematics

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:21.380
that goes into this.

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:23.090
I'll say there are some--

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:27.740
you know, in another piece of
beautiful, magical synergy,

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:31.250
it's not only that the kind
of math that I know and love

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:33.420
has something to say
about this problem,

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:37.400
but the problem gives back
by raising spectacularly

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:38.960
interesting new math questions.

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:41.720
All right, so if you want
to understand this walk,

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.120
it raises all kinds
of great questions

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:46.670
about how spanning trees work.

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:48.570
the probability that
there is a balanced cut

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:51.380
of a spanning tree?

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:54.980
Can you characterize this
Markov chain or random walk

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.170
on the space of spanning trees?

00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:59.270
Lots of great questions,
open questions-- this

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:04.866
is kind of a research frontier
of this particular application.

00:15:04.866 --> 00:15:07.500
That's the math model.

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:10.470
Now let's talk about
how it gets used,

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:14.028
and then I want to zoom out
to the big picture again.

00:15:14.028 --> 00:15:17.890
OK, so as you heard, I was
very privileged recently

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:21.760
to be asked to put this
in action in Pennsylvania.

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.850
This press release
made me smile.

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:25.225
So this is Governor
Tom Wolfe who

00:15:25.225 --> 00:15:29.206
was just re-elected comfortably
yesterday in Pennsylvania.

00:15:29.206 --> 00:15:30.580
And I think he
just really wanted

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:34.150
to say "enlist non-partisan
mathematician."

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:36.910
What could sound more
objective than a mathematician?

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:38.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:41.740
But here was the problem.

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:45.850
In Pennsylvania, it's one of
the states with split control.

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:47.980
It's been a Republican
controlled legislature

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:48.820
for some time.

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:51.130
It has a Democratic
governor, as you heard.

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:54.920
But they have to
agree on new maps.

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.790
The state Supreme
Court ultimately

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:02.710
was asked to
arbitrate a case that

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:05.770
invalidated the plan
that was enacted in 2011

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:07.210
as a partisan gerrymander.

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:08.710
And that's the
plan you see here.

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:14.140
It's a fairly notorious plan.

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.810
It's districts look
pretty disgusting.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:19.300
I like to characterize
shapes like this

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:22.060
as tumors and fractals.

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:24.220
It's got this
notorious district here

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:26.320
in the suburbs of Philadelphia.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:30.530
Some people call it Goofy
kicking Donald Duck.

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:33.365
All right, I'll show you a
close up a little bit later.

00:16:33.365 --> 00:16:35.230
And it was thrown
out by the courts.

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:38.710
And then the task of the
legislature and the governor

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:41.860
was to agree on new maps.

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:44.740
And what you see here is three
different attempts at new maps.

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:47.890
And other than tumors
and fractals over there,

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:51.310
I would say that, to my
eyes, the other three look

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:53.590
qualitatively fairly similar.

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:56.980
I don't think their visual
tells of nefarious intent

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:59.890
in any one more than the others.

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:02.540
Yet they perform
very differently.

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:05.079
So that's the task here
is to use that math

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:06.579
model that I
described to do kind

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:09.509
of forensics on these maps.

00:17:09.509 --> 00:17:10.869
As it turns out--

00:17:10.869 --> 00:17:13.000
so that was the 2011 plan.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.500
This was the new plan
floated by the legislature.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.450
Interestingly, they
didn't pass it as a bill.

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:21.958
They floated it on
Twitter, true story.

00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:23.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:26.650
This is the plan that
was counter proposed

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:27.819
by the governor's team.

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:30.080
I want to emphasize that
that was not my job.

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.830
I was doing map analysis,
not map creation.

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:35.590
So this was one of the
maps that I analyzed.

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:38.050
And this was the plan
that was ultimately

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:40.386
enacted by the courts.

00:17:40.386 --> 00:17:45.042
OK, so the challenge is to
understand what they're doing.

00:17:45.042 --> 00:17:47.150
OK, before I get
back to that, let

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:49.190
me talk about some
research findings that

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:51.200
are enabled by this math model.

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.570
And one of them I'll try
to illustrate on our home

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:55.490
state of Massachusetts.

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:58.760
And the finding is you don't
get proportionality for free.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:00.830
Before I explain this
picture, let me just

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:02.980
say out loud what I mean.

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:06.260
In Pennsylvania, it has
been the case for some time

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:09.170
that the partisan voting
patterns are about 50/50,

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:11.120
Democratic and Republican.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:15.470
But with about 50% of
the vote, Republicans

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:19.510
had been getting 13 out of
18 seats in the Congress,

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:21.410
in the congressional delegation.

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:25.100
And some people took that to be
prima facie evidence of abuse.

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.110
How can you be converting
half of the votes

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:29.300
into 72% of the seats?

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:30.140
Right?

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:33.350
So one of the
findings of the model

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:38.360
is that you'd be surprised at
what happens when you neutrally

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:39.410
redistrict.

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:41.330
You shouldn't expect
proportional outcomes

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:42.400
to just come for free.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:46.160
And actually, one of the punch
lines of this whole research

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.200
enterprise and of
the talk I hope

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:51.020
is proportionality
is complicated.

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:53.390
If that's what
we're after, we have

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:55.620
a bad system for securing it.

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:56.510
And there are others.

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:57.741
I'll come back to that.

00:18:57.741 --> 00:18:59.990
OK, but I wanted to illustrate
that with Massachusetts

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:02.650
because here's a fairly
dramatic example.

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:04.280
So what you see
in this picture is

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:06.410
an image that comes
from voting patterns

00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:08.060
in an actual election--

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:11.240
Kennedy versus Chase
for US Senate in 2006.

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.149
This election was an
interesting geometry.

00:19:14.149 --> 00:19:15.440
What you see in the picture is.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:19.970
This chase got over 30% of
the vote in that election.

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:23.600
Now, of course, that
was a Senate race.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.587
But now let's just imagine that,
with people voting that way,

00:19:26.587 --> 00:19:28.170
let's imagine that
I tried to district

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:29.270
some into nine districts.

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:31.940
Massachusetts currently
has nine districts.

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:34.370
How many seats
would you expect--

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:37.190
in how many districts would
you expect a Chase majority?

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:39.350
Well, you might think,
since this is about a third

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:42.920
of the vote, I'd expect Chase to
get up to a third of the seats

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:46.240
or maybe more, right, maybe two
or three out of the nine seats.

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:47.570
Right?

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:49.880
What I've done
here is highlighted

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:54.200
the most Chase-favoring possible
collection of precincts.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.074
And I've just aggregated
them until I get up

00:19:56.074 --> 00:19:57.740
to the size of a
congressional district.

00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:00.370
So that's a ninth of
Massachusetts' population.

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:02.370
Everybody understand
what I'm highlighting?

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:05.150
OK, so Chase we
think maybe should

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:06.740
get two or three districts.

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:10.220
This would be the first one, the
most Chase-favoring district.

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:15.132
Yet this collection
still prefers Kennedy.

00:20:15.132 --> 00:20:17.330
OK, so I hope there's a
little surprise there.

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:19.850
And let me try to reiterate.

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:20.990
Here it is.

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:24.140
There are more plans for how
to district Massachusetts

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.420
than particles in the
galaxy, literally.

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:30.820
Yet every single one of them
has a 9-0 Democratic delegation,

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:32.948
every one.

00:20:32.948 --> 00:20:33.800
Right?

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.520
So if you thought, based on the
intuition that proportionality

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:39.800
is natural or
desirable, maybe you

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.380
would have thought that
Democrats are gerrymandering

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:43.350
Massachusetts.

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.850
Right?

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:45.183
They're locking out Republicans.

00:20:45.183 --> 00:20:47.030
But it's should the
math that's locking out

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:49.140
Republicans in Massachusetts.

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:51.980
So even if I let a
district be scattered

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:53.930
and discontiguous
like this, I just

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:56.510
couldn't get Republican
representation here.

00:20:56.510 --> 00:21:00.980
OK, phenomena like this are
interesting in every state.

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:03.110
You see where the
votes are, and then you

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:06.340
have to see how districting
handles those votes.

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:09.398
And the answer isn't
always what you expect.

00:21:09.398 --> 00:21:14.010
OK, second finding, shape
signifies less than you think.

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:16.430
Here are two plans
of Pennsylvania.

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:19.620
And what I'm going to do
is use a common metric

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:22.290
from political science
called the mean-median gap

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:25.230
to see if these plans are
built to favor Democrats

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:26.600
or Republicans.

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.290
And here's what we get.

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:34.530
So we ran this Markov chain for,
in this case, a billion steps,

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:37.050
a billion steps of
the Markov chain.

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:41.390
And here's the plan that
was enacted in 2011.

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:44.620
And that's a billion
plans similar to it.

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:46.410
And what's being
measured here is

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:51.464
how much the plan
has a partisan skew

00:21:51.464 --> 00:21:52.630
in the Republican direction.

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:54.463
So that's the
Republican-favoring direction.

00:21:54.463 --> 00:21:57.820
And what you see is that
the current plan is here.

00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:00.120
A billion similar
plans are here.

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:05.310
That plan is not
just an outlier.

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:07.850
It's not just in the thin
part of the bell curve.

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:11.776
It's in what I like to call the
invisible part of the curve.

00:22:11.776 --> 00:22:14.660
OK, here's the new
plan that was proposed

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:19.210
by Republican legislators
earlier this year.

00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:21.860
It's called TS, the
Turzai-Scarnati plan.

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:23.730
It looks just fine.

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:29.650
But under the hood, it
performs strikingly similarly.

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:31.230
There's the plan.

00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:33.680
There's the billion
comparison maps,

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.643
invisible part of the curve.

00:22:35.643 --> 00:22:42.400
OK, even though
there are surprises

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.740
when you do analysis
like this, it

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:48.520
does still actually vary
in whether it tells you

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:50.270
that a plan is an outlier.

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:52.110
So here's the plan of
the governor's team,

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:55.090
which, again, I
wasn't a part of made.

00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:56.970
In fact, not only
was I not part of it,

00:22:56.970 --> 00:23:00.880
I was in some suspense
about how this test would

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.850
evaluate this plan.

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:04.390
And here's the answer.

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:06.040
Not every plan is an outlier.

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.740
Some plans sort of hit the
meaty part of their distribution

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:09.947
of comparisons.

00:23:09.947 --> 00:23:11.815
All right, does that make sense?

00:23:11.815 --> 00:23:16.190
OK, so what's going on here?

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:18.740
We're learning that
a test like this

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:22.590
can tell you when a
plan is very extreme

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:26.510
or when it shares properties
with most other things

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:29.480
or many other things in this
universe of alternatives.

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:33.800
The way this is intended to be
used is not to select a plan.

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:37.070
It's to rule out the ones that
are most egregiously outlying.

00:23:39.848 --> 00:23:46.840
OK, so that's the math model
and an application of it.

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:48.520
And now what I
want to do is kind

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:50.590
of look at the stakes,
which we haven't really

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:52.570
talked about yet.

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:55.090
So before we can
get to the stakes,

00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:57.980
we have to say something
about the realistic rules.

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:00.430
So what are the rules
for redistricting?

00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:02.422
Well, plans must be
population balanced.

00:24:02.422 --> 00:24:04.630
I'm going to quickly review
some of the common rules.

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:06.130
Actually, before I
do this, I should

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:11.440
say the states have a lot of
authority and a lot of latitude

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:13.270
in how they make
their own rules.

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:15.270
Very few of them are universal.

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:17.320
But here, this one is.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:19.090
It's almost the
only guidance that's

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:21.320
extracted from the Constitution.

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:24.070
And it says that the plans
should balance population.

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:26.680
For legislative districts,
they need to balance typically

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:28.090
to within 10%.

00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:30.640
For congressional districts,
the current practice,

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.280
believe it or not, is
to balance the census

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:37.065
population of your districts
down to one person deviation.

00:24:37.065 --> 00:24:40.590
OK, so that's
insanely stringent.

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:45.220
Two, compact, so this
is a vague desideratum.

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:47.980
And it says that the district
should have a reasonable shape.

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:49.600
And that's activating
that intuition

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:53.770
that bad shapes are
red flags of nefarity.

00:24:57.032 --> 00:25:02.870
We see again Goofy
kicking Donald Duck,

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:07.430
maybe kind of flouting that
compactness a little bit.

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:10.190
The next requirement is
that the district should

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:12.050
be connected in a single piece.

00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:13.760
This is, but just.

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:16.820
So there's actually two
different cut points

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:19.550
in this district, two different
places where the district could

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:23.690
be disconnected by the
removal of a single building,

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:28.238
true story, a hospital
and a seafood restaurant.

00:25:28.238 --> 00:25:32.600
OK, next, the districting
should avoid splitting counties

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:34.070
or cities.

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:37.250
Here's a picture to
illustrate that that's hard.

00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:41.336
This is Columbus,
Ohio and its county.

00:25:41.336 --> 00:25:44.481
And they actually overlap
each other in an odd ways.

00:25:44.481 --> 00:25:45.980
So if you're a
redistricter, and you

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:48.320
try not to split that
county and that city,

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.740
that's actually
complicated guidance.

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:55.520
Avoid splitting
communities of interest.

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:58.760
This is a very interesting
rule and a very slippery rule

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:01.207
and a very lightly
enforced rule that

00:26:01.207 --> 00:26:03.290
says that, when you have
a community with a shared

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:05.886
interest, you should try
to keep them together.

00:26:05.886 --> 00:26:09.290
And then, finally and
crucially, there's

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:12.450
the federal Voting
Rights Act of 1965

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:15.600
that discusses opportunity
for minority groups

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:16.880
to elect candidates of choice.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.130
And I'll come back to that.

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:21.780
I put this slide up as a
reminder of the humility

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:24.930
with which you have to approach
this problem as a modeler.

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:28.680
Right, these rules are
difficult to operationalize.

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.809
They're difficult to prioritize.

00:26:30.809 --> 00:26:32.850
They're difficult to
incorporate into your model.

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:34.910
And yet, they're essential.

00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:38.310
So sometimes, you'll see
modelers ignore the rules

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:41.750
that they can't quantify.

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:44.170
And that seems to me to
be modeling malpractice.

00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:46.980
OK, so I think, when you want
to make an applicable model,

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:49.560
you want to think
really hard about how

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.754
all your rules interact.

00:26:52.754 --> 00:26:55.290
OK, so what are the stakes?

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:59.640
Here's an image that
shows you something

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:01.380
about US redistricting.

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:05.250
So this shows you about a
dozen different districts

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:09.900
around the country, face blends
of their average district

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:16.850
resident, a home at the actual
median price in each district,

00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:20.550
a recent ballot initiative, and
the representative downstream

00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:22.962
from all of that.

00:27:22.962 --> 00:27:25.150
And when you look at
the texture of this,

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:28.680
you really start to see
the delicate dependence

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.840
on line drawing for vastly
different representational

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:32.990
outcomes.

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:35.410
So let's take a look
at Southern California.

00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:41.080
So here are California 43
and 49, two districts very

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:44.560
close to each other in
Southern California.

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:46.270
Because of how the
lines are drawn,

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:48.820
they have quite different
district residences

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:52.930
in terms of the demographic
makeups of their districts,

00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:57.520
vastly different median home
values and per capita incomes,

00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:00.560
in the case of 43, a median
home value that's many,

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:04.556
many times its
per capita income.

00:28:04.556 --> 00:28:09.060
They vote differently on
California's myriad ballot

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:10.130
initiatives.

00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:12.930
And they get very
different representation.

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:14.950
So this is from the last cycle.

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:18.330
And many of you may recognize
the inimitable Maxine

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:22.020
Waters and the also
inimitable Darrell Issa.

00:28:25.086 --> 00:28:27.090
And this leads us
back to this point.

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:30.210
Here those two districts
again on a map of the country.

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:33.880
They're tiny, and they're
delicately constructed.

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:36.840
And it may give you a
whole lot of bewilderment

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.300
about exactly everything
that flows out,

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:41.790
but it's a reminder of the
stakes of this line drawing

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:43.170
process.

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:46.990
OK, so under the hood a little
more, let's look at Ohio.

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:53.170
Here's how Ohio voted in 2016.

00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:56.140
They had just over half the
votes went to Republicans

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:59.730
in the congressional
race, but 3/4 of the seats

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:02.750
were to Republicans in
the congressional race.

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:04.850
This is a model that
tries to understand

00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:08.990
what would happen if you model
partisan swing towards one

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:10.285
party or the other.

00:29:10.285 --> 00:29:12.410
So if you take the vote in
the different districts,

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:15.740
and you dial it
gently up or down,

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:17.540
this is how it would vary.

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:20.135
So what's the
conclusion of this?

00:29:20.135 --> 00:29:25.100
The conclusion is that that
12-to-4 delegation would have

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:27.680
occurred-- you see this
giant plateau here--

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:30.500
with Republicans getting
anywhere from 49%

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:31.860
to 79% of the vote.

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:37.450
Is this wildly effective
gerrymandering or an artifact

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:38.380
of where people live?

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:40.690
That's what the math
model can do for you.

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:43.440
Meanwhile, here are the stakes.

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:46.000
OK, these are the 16
representatives of Ohio

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.600
before yesterday.

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:50.320
And now I'll show you the
16 representatives of Ohio

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.760
after yesterday.

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.696
Here they are again.

00:29:53.696 --> 00:29:57.670
OK, there wasn't
really a close race.

00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:01.510
By contrast, Pennsylvania,
which had its lines radically

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:07.260
redrawn in the process
from earlier this year,

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:11.460
had enormous makeover of its
congressional delegation.

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:18.240
Interestingly, Pennsylvania's
18-person delegation

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:23.720
was the largest in the country
to be all-male until yesterday

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.800
and elected four women
for the first time.

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:33.276
I think it's the year of the
blonde woman in particular

00:30:33.276 --> 00:30:35.386
in Pennsylvania.

00:30:35.386 --> 00:30:40.300
OK, so the stakes
of all the math

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.730
are actual representatives
who go to Washington

00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:44.170
and behave quite differently.

00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:48.460
So I want to devote this
next section of the talk

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:50.470
to kind of revisiting
the redistricting

00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:53.890
problem as a nexus of
concerns from many different

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:58.392
disciplinary traditions and
for many different fields.

00:30:58.392 --> 00:31:04.350
OK, history matters
for understanding

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:05.880
how redistricting works.

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.710
So as many of you
probably recognize,

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:11.130
here is the original
gerrymander.

00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:14.610
So here we are.

00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:18.030
This is a picture from
the North Shore of Boston.

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:20.190
And it's a districting
plan that was

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:24.780
approved in 1812 by then
governor Elbridge Gerry.

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:28.080
Some of you may notice,
as you tool around town,

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.000
around Cambridge,
how many things are

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.620
named after him around town.

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:34.050
So there's Gerrys
Landing Road down when

00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:36.970
you're trying to get from Mem
Drive from around the corner

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:38.340
onto Soldiers Field.

00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:44.470
There's Gerry Lane right
up four blocks from here.

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:45.510
Who was he?

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:47.380
Besides the governor
of Massachusetts,

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:50.940
he was sort of one of the
giants, the so so-called

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:52.590
founding fathers.

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:55.150
He was a representative.

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:59.460
He was a, well,
governor until 1812.

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:03.540
He actually was voted
out in this election

00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:05.730
and then became Vice President.

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:07.260
So he sort of has
his fingerprints

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:09.060
all over really America.

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:12.450
What's going on in this picture
is a congressional district

00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:15.720
that was thought to favor
Gerry's Democratic-Republican

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:19.140
Party over the
rival Federalists.

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:22.210
For those of you who've had the
pleasure of seeing Hamilton,

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:24.990
which I recently
did, you got to see

00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:28.950
these two rival factions,
in the persons of Hamilton

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:30.360
and Jefferson, battle it out.

00:32:33.804 --> 00:32:35.660
Here's the political cartoon--

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:39.100
this one's from 1813 in the
Salem Gazette-- that kind of

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:40.090
brought that to life.

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:42.730
And I want to actually show
you a little bit of its text

00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:44.830
because I think
it's fascinating.

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:47.950
"Federalists, followers
of Washington,

00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:50.260
again behold and shudder
at the exhibition

00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:52.570
of this terrific
dragon brought forth

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:56.050
to swallow and devour your
liberties and equal rights.

00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:58.690
Unholy party spirit and
inordinate love of power

00:32:58.690 --> 00:32:59.680
gave it birth.

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.660
Your patriotism and
hatred of tyranny

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:05.880
must by one vigorous struggle
strangle it in its infancy."

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:08.336
A little over the top, perhaps.

00:33:08.336 --> 00:33:10.160
What's the argument
that it's making?

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:14.050
It's that, from its
shape, as exaggerated here

00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:19.030
by its claws and its
wings, Gerry's salamander,

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:22.060
or the gerrymander,
is giving you evidence

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:24.930
of its unfair and bad design.

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:31.890
So that's kind of the partisan
terrain in gerrymandering

00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:35.780
has been fought out
since at least 1812.

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:38.760
But the 20th century gives
us a different history

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:39.880
of gerrymandering.

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:42.910
So here's the
gerrymander of the 1950s.

00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:46.650
What we see here is
Tuskegee, Alabama,

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:51.280
which redrew its own
city lines in 1957.

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:54.114
So that made its way--
that was challenged

00:33:54.114 --> 00:33:55.530
and made its way
up to the Supreme

00:33:55.530 --> 00:34:00.585
Court in a landmark case from
1960, Gomillion v. Lightfoot.

00:34:00.585 --> 00:34:05.360
So before the redrawing,
Tuskegee was larger.

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:07.370
It voluntarily shrank itself.

00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:10.190
It used to be the green
square that you see here

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:15.020
and then redrew itself to be
this 28-sided eccentric looking

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:16.630
polygon.

00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:18.139
Why?

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:21.800
You won't be surprised to
hear before the redrawing

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:25.610
Tuskegee was nearly 80% black,
and then it became actually

00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:28.320
100% white after the redrawing.

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:31.280
So there's such
pervasive and dramatic

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:33.909
residential racial
housing segregation

00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:37.100
that it's possible
with surgical precision

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:42.110
to draw yourself
a one-race city.

00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:45.770
This particular case was fairly
easy for the Supreme Court

00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:49.010
to handle because it's a
matter of disenfranchisement.

00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:52.370
If black voters here are
drawn out of the city,

00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:54.620
they're in unincorporated
territory in Alabama.

00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:57.830
They have no more mayor,
city council, city services.

00:34:57.830 --> 00:34:59.590
They've lost a vote.

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:01.770
So the Supreme Court
threw this out.

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:03.382
This was fairly easy.

00:35:03.382 --> 00:35:05.950
The congressional
case is a lot harder

00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:08.530
because, when you're drawn out
of one congressional district,

00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:10.610
you've drawn into another.

00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:13.720
So it becomes a matter
of weight of votes

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:17.600
and not of having or
not having the vote.

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:22.240
And to this moment, the court
has kind of continued to punt.

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:25.800
The Supreme Court has continued
to punt on how to handle that.

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:28.420
OK, onward into
the 1960s, here's

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:30.320
a picture of Mississippi.

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:32.110
Now the black population
in Mississippi

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:34.950
is concentrated here
in the delta region,

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:38.480
and Jackson is around there.

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:41.200
Here are some districting
plans of Mississippi

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:44.250
before the 1960 census.

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:46.990
And here are the three
plans that the Mississippi

00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:49.810
legislature considered
after that census.

00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:52.090
Look what's happening.

00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:56.050
Whereas the delta used to be
preserved in a single district,

00:35:56.050 --> 00:35:59.890
it's split two or three ways
in each of the new plans,

00:35:59.890 --> 00:36:03.140
guaranteeing zero
majority black districts.

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:05.950
So this is the
fundamental context

00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:08.890
of all of the legal
framework that we have around

00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:10.682
gerrymandering today.

00:36:10.682 --> 00:36:14.170
So it's the civil
rights moment that

00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:18.380
gives birth to the biggest tool
that we have for voting rights.

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:20.650
And that's the Voting
Rights Act of 1965.

00:36:20.650 --> 00:36:23.030
Here's an image from
the signing ceremony.

00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:26.440
So this is a powerful bill
that was originally aimed

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:29.920
at eliminating so-called devices
blocking the black vote--

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:33.390
poll taxes, literacy
tests, and so on.

00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:37.120
Some historical hot spot
regions around the country

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:41.500
were bound by Section 5
of the Voting Rights Act

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:44.560
to request preclearance
from the federal government

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:47.464
before they could make any
changes to their voting rules.

00:36:47.464 --> 00:36:49.630
Actually, I want to emphasize
how important this is.

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:52.330
This isn't just you need
prior permission if you

00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:53.800
want to change the districts.

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:56.590
It's all changes to your
voting related rules--

00:36:56.590 --> 00:36:59.170
early voting hours, polling
locations, all of that.

00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:02.840
You need prior approval
from the federal government.

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:06.940
In 2013, that was swept away in
a Supreme Court decision called

00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:10.130
Shelby v. Holder.

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:13.600
What that's left in
its wake is a situation

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:16.900
where multiple states had
restrictive new voting

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:20.380
laws cued up and ready
to go for this decision.

00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:23.980
Three or more states passed
new voting restrictions the day

00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:25.420
this decision came down.

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:27.720
And now, instead of
being blocked in advance,

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:30.080
those have to be
litigated after the fact.

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:33.190
All right, so it's changed
the landscape considerably.

00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:35.260
But the Voting
Rights Act for now

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:37.970
lives on and is still
a very powerful tool.

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:41.634
It's been frequently renewed
and expanded in interesting ways

00:37:41.634 --> 00:37:42.550
that I won't get into.

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:45.134
That's the subject of
a whole other story.

00:37:45.134 --> 00:37:46.300
But it's still on the books.

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:47.770
It's still important.

00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:51.940
And it's still, in some ways,
the only legal tool that we.

00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:59.430
Next, a reminder of all the
ways that this matters--

00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:01.830
so here we are in Massachusetts
where we currently

00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:03.630
have nine congressional
districts,

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:06.510
but we have all kinds of
other lines and zones.

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:08.620
We have a state
Senate with districts,

00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:11.120
a state house with districts,
a governor's council.

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:12.590
We have school districts.

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:15.000
And here in Boston,
I think that should

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.480
have a specially resonant
history because, in the 1970s,

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:23.340
it was specifically not
just the idea of busing,

00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:25.050
but how that busing
was implemented

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:27.690
in terms of zones,
maps, and who would

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:31.470
be bused where, that
triggered racist riots

00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:36.480
and gave Boston a long enduring
reputation as a racially

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:41.410
problematic city
among many others.

00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:45.900
Interestingly, when legislators
can't agree on a map,

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:48.780
courts throw it to
an outside expert.

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:52.060
That expert is called, in
a fairly resonant term,

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:53.770
a special master.

00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:58.080
So it was a special master who
drew the school busing map here

00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:01.980
in Boston that cross-bused
between Charlestown

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:07.440
and Dorchester, particularly,
some say igniting the powder

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:09.550
keg that became the riots.

00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:13.480
And it's a special master who
redrew Pennsylvania's map.

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:15.690
It's a special master
who's been called on

00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:17.490
to redraw Virginia's map.

00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:20.240
So this is still very much
a system that's in effect.

00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:24.870
This slide is also
intended to remind us,

00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:27.030
in terms of the
history and the stakes,

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:31.230
that it's not just Congress,
but redistricting also

00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:34.140
has a very local texture.

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:36.780
And where the rules are
more constrained when

00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:38.560
it comes to
congressional districts,

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.590
they can be much
more up for grabs

00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:42.210
when it comes to
everything local.

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:48.590
OK, these narratives intertwine.

00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:52.190
So I'm going to end this
talk with just four vignettes

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:55.310
about the power of these
kinds of forensic techniques

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:57.680
to show us how
redistricting works

00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:00.410
around the country in
a way that combines

00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:03.446
these various elements.

00:40:03.446 --> 00:40:06.770
Notorious district,
Illinois 4, the earmuffs--

00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:09.314
anyone recognize it?

00:40:09.314 --> 00:40:16.580
OK, those of you from Chicago
may recognize it better now.

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:20.180
Here it is sitting
inside the city,

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:23.570
connecting Pilsen, a
predominantly Mexican

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:26.960
neighborhood on the south
side, with Humboldt Park, which

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:29.390
is the center of the city's
Puerto Rican community

00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:34.570
on the north side, strung
together via a highway.

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:37.120
What effects does
the construction

00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:40.060
of a district like this have?

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:41.820
Packing.

00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:46.430
So Luis Gutierrez did
represent this district--

00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:48.610
he's decided to move on--

00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:52.780
but from 1992 continuously
to 2016, never getting

00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:55.964
less than 75% of the vote.

00:40:55.964 --> 00:40:59.070
OK, so this looks
like a textbook case

00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:02.100
where Latinos have been
packed in inefficient numbers

00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:04.920
into a district to dilute
their voting strength.

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:06.570
But in an interesting
twist, this

00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:10.980
turns out to be friendly
packing, endorsed and actually

00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:13.960
aided by civil rights groups.

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:17.200
An actual image for you
from John Oliver's show

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:22.450
of a real-life wedding cake
of two redistricting legal

00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:24.260
experts--

00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:28.180
"Nick Ruth, Combining
Communities of Interest"--

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:29.960
because they both
worked on this district.

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:32.050
So what's the story
of the district?

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:34.510
It's a Latino district
that was built

00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:40.900
to interlock with three
African-American districts also

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:43.300
locking in and heading
towards the south side.

00:41:46.569 --> 00:41:48.630
What I find
fascinating about this

00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:54.700
is that it's a well-meaning
gerrymander in a sense.

00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:58.330
It's predicated on the
idea that, in order

00:41:58.330 --> 00:42:00.280
to comply with the
Voting Rights Act,

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:02.680
you want separate
opportunity districts

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:04.510
for different racial groups.

00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:07.660
I'm happy to say
that today, in 2018,

00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:09.810
we're starting to see
some of that logic break

00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:12.820
down, as civil
rights organizations,

00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:14.740
like the Lawyers'
Committee and others,

00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:19.420
are bringing for the first time
coalition voting rights claims.

00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:21.670
So right here in Massachusetts,
the Lawyers' Committee

00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:25.600
has a case in Lowell,
which is a coalition

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:28.450
Latino-Cambodian
voting rights claim.

00:42:28.450 --> 00:42:31.540
OK, and I think this is a
new and important frontier

00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:35.050
in the history of
voting rights litigation

00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:38.830
where, instead of creating
separate and kind of calcified,

00:42:38.830 --> 00:42:43.140
ossified racial categories
with separate districts,

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:47.350
there's more coalitional
thinking going forward.

00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:49.840
Ironies of segregation--
here's an image

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:53.110
that comes from a white paper
that our research group put

00:42:53.110 --> 00:42:56.140
together because we were
asked to look at redistricting

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:57.357
in Santa Clara, California.

00:42:57.357 --> 00:42:59.440
Before I tell you what's
happening in the picture,

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:02.680
let me give you a bit of
back story on Santa Clara.

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:07.390
It's about 40% Asian and was
sued by Asian civil rights

00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:10.780
groups because its six-member
city council had never

00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:13.960
had an Asian member, OK,
with a 40% Asian population

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:15.820
in the city

00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:18.360
the city, interestingly,
said you're right.

00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:20.320
Our system is
terrible and racist.

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:21.490
Let's replace it.

00:43:21.490 --> 00:43:24.280
And OK, they didn't
in those words.

00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:30.500
And the interesting contestation
became replace it with what.

00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:34.380
OK, so we used our models to try
to understand how districting

00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:38.130
would work because that's the
go-to remedy when you throw out

00:43:38.130 --> 00:43:42.090
an at-large city council
system is to move to districts.

00:43:42.090 --> 00:43:44.460
And here's an irony
that we found.

00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:46.620
So in this simple
model, I'm showing you

00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:51.950
40% of the population either
scattered in a regular pattern,

00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:55.440
semi-clustered, or clustered
as in a kind of more

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:57.420
segregated way around the city.

00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:00.256
Then we run our model.

00:44:00.256 --> 00:44:01.922
The computers go boop,
boop, boop, boop.

00:44:01.922 --> 00:44:05.130
And they tell us what kind
of representational outcomes

00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:06.270
we should expect.

00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:09.010
And what we found
surprised me quite a bit.

00:44:09.010 --> 00:44:11.920
What we found was this
is not surprising.

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:15.450
If you're very
checkerboarded around a city,

00:44:15.450 --> 00:44:17.460
you're not going to do
very well under districts

00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:19.636
because you'll have a
minority of every district.

00:44:19.636 --> 00:44:20.510
Does that make sense?

00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:22.180
That should be kind of obvious.

00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:26.010
On the other hand,
segregation does at least

00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:29.490
ensure a strong possibility
of representation.

00:44:29.490 --> 00:44:31.050
But here's the surprise.

00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:34.590
As you kind of interpolate
between these extremes,

00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:38.350
it takes a long time for your
representation to kick in.

00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:41.070
So here's our kind of
semi-clustered configuration.

00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:42.000
And check it out.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.850
It performs just as
badly under districting

00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:46.540
as the checkerboard.

00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:48.714
So from a mathematical
point of view,

00:44:48.714 --> 00:44:50.130
there's a kind of
phase transition

00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:52.720
that occurs as you cluster more.

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:54.164
And representation
doesn't kick in

00:44:54.164 --> 00:44:55.455
until you're fairly segregated.

00:44:55.455 --> 00:44:57.937
So I call this ironies
of segregation.

00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:05.920
Just a few more images, this
is ongoing work modeling

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:08.990
the situation happening
right now in Virginia.

00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:11.710
So here are three
maps of Virginia

00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:14.560
in the wake of
its district court

00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:16.780
throwing out its house
of delegates' plan

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:18.580
as a racial gerrymander.

00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:21.863
This is the enacted Republican
plan, a democratic counter

00:45:21.863 --> 00:45:25.590
proposal, and an independent
third party group.

00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:29.890
And what we were able to do
is, using our ensemble methods,

00:45:29.890 --> 00:45:32.590
building big piles
of comparison plans,

00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:36.370
we can see how each of these
performs in the distribution

00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:41.620
of black voting age population
compared to neutrally computer

00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:44.020
generated maps.

00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:48.800
And what you see is here's
a zone of black population

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:52.010
where you're empirically
likely to be able to elect

00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:53.900
a black representative.

00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:56.900
And I hope this gives you
kind of a forensic glimpse

00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:59.490
into the statistical
guts of these plans.

00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:02.150
It's showing you that, for
instance, this Republican plan

00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:05.600
elevated or packed black
population in these districts

00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:08.810
so much that it's depressed
in the next batch or two

00:46:08.810 --> 00:46:10.880
of districts,
costing opportunity

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:14.300
for African-Americans to
elect candidates of choice.

00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:17.160
But the analysis shows you more.

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:20.540
Here's the zone where
you're more likely to elect

00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:23.910
white Democrats.

00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:26.280
And that's where a
lot of blue dots fall.

00:46:30.564 --> 00:46:33.020
OK, so an analysis
like this can show you

00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:36.260
whether districts are geared
towards black representation

00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:40.926
or, perhaps, maybe optimized
to elect more white Democrats.

00:46:40.926 --> 00:46:45.120
Finally, let's come full
circle to Mississippi.

00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:50.280
And I'll just say, with our
methods of generating plans,

00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:52.230
we were able to
generate millions

00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:54.150
of alternative Mississippis.

00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:57.790
Today, Mississippi has four
congressional districts.

00:46:57.790 --> 00:47:01.950
One of them is about 2/3
black, and the others

00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:03.620
are 1/3 black or less.

00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:07.140
It elects one black Democrat
and three white Republicans.

00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:08.670
And what you see,
as you randomly

00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:12.120
explore that vast
space of possibilities,

00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:14.490
is that it doesn't
need to be so.

00:47:14.490 --> 00:47:17.070
And Mississippi could
have a vastly different

00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:20.010
congressional delegation and
a vastly different balance

00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:24.150
in its districts, and it takes
computers really just a second

00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:26.830
to find other ways to do so.

00:47:26.830 --> 00:47:29.800
OK, so I'll close
with the punch lines.

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:33.150
What are the bottom
lines about the lines?

00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:36.330
Small picture, the rules
interact in complicated ways,

00:47:36.330 --> 00:47:38.700
but the models can help
us figure that out.

00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:40.500
The eyeball test is dead.

00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:44.520
It no longer can tell us when
something's been gerrymandered.

00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:47.280
Deviations from proportionality
are more complicated

00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:48.740
than we thought.

00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:51.960
And there's maybe even a
new normative story here

00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:52.890
about gerrymandering.

00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:55.680
So what is this outlier
test bringing to us

00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:57.550
as a matter of fairness?

00:47:57.550 --> 00:47:59.850
It's asking the
question, does a map

00:47:59.850 --> 00:48:02.670
behave as though drawn only
from the stated principles.

00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:05.500
And where it deviates,
is there a reason?

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:09.150
These are the kinds of questions
that this outlier analysis can

00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:10.080
bring you.

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:12.240
In the big picture,
I hope the takeaways

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:15.460
are that single-member plurality
districts are a legacy.

00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:17.700
They're an artifact of
many layered histories

00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:19.230
that I hope I've outlined.

00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:21.510
You can't tell the
story of redistricting

00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:24.180
without the story of the
black vote in particular

00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:27.780
and the violent and genteel
efforts at suppressing it

00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:30.120
throughout US history.

00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:31.890
There's a kind of
perverse irony in play

00:48:31.890 --> 00:48:34.260
that districts work best
to secure representation

00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:38.060
for a numerical minority in the
presence of marked segregation.

00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:39.960
And so less
segregated populations

00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:43.140
are much harder to represent
with a districting system.

00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:45.630
This is true not only for
Asians in Santa Clara,

00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:47.490
but for Republicans
in Massachusetts.

00:48:47.490 --> 00:48:50.010
All right, this is true
for any numerical minority.

00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:53.160
Republicans are just not
segregated enough here

00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:55.030
in Massachusetts.

00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:57.260
The Voting Rights Act
is a fundamental tool,

00:48:57.260 --> 00:49:01.350
best that we have, but it
calcifies racial categories.

00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:03.270
And then the math
model, what does it do?

00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:05.860
It gives us a baseline
for neutral redistricting.

00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:08.940
It reveals forensics
of map design.

00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:11.450
And it lets us
challenge our intuitions

00:49:11.450 --> 00:49:13.160
that something is being gamed.

00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:15.845
Fairness or justice does
not equal neutrality.

00:49:15.845 --> 00:49:17.550
And that's another matter.

00:49:17.550 --> 00:49:21.020
And so computers should
never draw our maps for us.

00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:24.600
They should be tools that rein
in the most extreme abuses.

00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:25.100
Thank you.
