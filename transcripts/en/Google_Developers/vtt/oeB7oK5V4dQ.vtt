LOUIS GRAY: Welcome back to
Google Developers Live at I/O.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.450
Louis Gray here with
Daniel Sieberg.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:09.860
DANIEL SIEBERG: That's right.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.450
And one of the big mentions of
the keynote yesterday was, of

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:15.760
course, Google Maps.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.480
We saw a lot of big updates
and refreshes.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.170
And so yesterday, I
got a chance to go

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.000
to the Sandbox here.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.170
Some amazing stuff going on.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.090
I think it's fascinating what
people are doing tying into

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:26.450
the Maps API.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.760
LOUIS GRAY: We're short on time
before the next session.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.540
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yes, we are.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:29.580
LOUIS GRAY: So what we're going
to do is we're going to

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.210
right to that interview
that took place

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.930
with the Sandbox yesterday.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.180
Let's go ahead and
roll that video.

00:00:42.583 --> 00:03:01.010
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.550
DANIEL SIEBERG: Hi there.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.180
I'm Daniel Sieberg with
Google Developers

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.930
Live here at I/O 2013.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.000
We find ourselves in the Maps
Sandbox, and I'm joined right

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.040
now by Mano Marks, who
is a Lead Developer

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.160
Advocate on the Maps team.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.050
We're going be talking about
Nintendo's Wii Street U. So I

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.500
want you to walk us through what
this is all about, and

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.030
obviously bring in Ryan
here for Nintendo.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.810
MANO MARKS: Sure.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.350
So hi.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:22.080
I'm Mano.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.870
This is Ryan Lund from Nintendo
showing off the Wii

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.980
U, which has a great new Street
View application using

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.270
the Wii U and the Wii
U controller.

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.420
So do you want to walk
us through it?

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.180
RYAN LUND: Yes, please.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.100
Thank you, Mano.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.180
So what we have here is we
have Wii Street View.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.250
This is a free application
available on the

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.035
Nintendo Wii U console.

00:03:39.035 --> 00:03:41.840
You can download it today
from the Free Shop.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.390
And what it is, it's an
application written in HTML5

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.590
and JavaScript using the
Nintendo web framework, and

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.010
that allowed us to really wrap
and reiterate on this

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.420
application, as well as use the
great Google Maps APIs to

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.630
bring in the Maps data and
really make it a very

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.655
interactive experience with
the Wii Street U and the

00:04:00.655 --> 00:04:01.780
Street View data.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.496
So I'm just going to walk you
through this application a

00:04:03.496 --> 00:04:04.570
little bit.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.850
So what we have is first thing
is I'm going to take you on a

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:13.750
tour, and so I'm going to load
up on the game pad here some

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.470
recommended spots, and we're
going to go ahead and jump

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.859
over to Florence, Italy.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.390
And what you can see down here
on the game pad is that I can

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.180
navigate the Street View
information very naturally

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.990
with the gyroscope information
from the game pad controller.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.562
And you can see that we have
really smooth motion.

00:04:40.562 --> 00:04:43.740
I can go ahead and start
navigating down

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.730
this Italian street.

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.700
And all of this information is
stored in the Google Maps

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.170
servers, and it's really great
that when we designed and

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.720
worked with this application,
we had all of this content

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.785
available to us, all of these
really good imagery that we

00:04:58.785 --> 00:05:02.500
could just put and interface
on top of.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.510
One of the new features that
we just enabled in the

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.442
application is integration
with Wiiverse, which is

00:05:07.442 --> 00:05:09.326
Nintendo's social platform.

00:05:09.326 --> 00:05:11.445
So I'm going to go ahead
and give you a

00:05:11.445 --> 00:05:12.630
demonstration of that.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.600
So this allows you to, when you
find a location or a spot

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.540
that's really interesting, you
can flag it and upload it to

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.640
the Miiverse servers and share
it with your friends or share

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.460
it with the community
so that they can

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.350
find those spots later.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.515
So I'm going to select Latest
Posts, and these are posts

00:05:29.515 --> 00:05:34.360
that have been shared live by
users of Wii Street View now.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.340
DANIEL SIEBERG: So Mano, talk
to me a little bit about

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.920
working with Nintendo,
what that was like.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.940
This is a very unique way of
seeing the Street View imagery

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:41.730
through a gaming console.

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:44.420
MANO MARKS: It was a really
exciting partnership because

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.450
their platform is based on web,
so they're actually using

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.570
the JavaScript APIs
to build this.

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.380
So this is something,
theoretically, that anybody

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:58.770
who had their own platform and
the right licenses could do

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.055
using the Google Maps API.

00:06:01.055 --> 00:06:04.290
It's really an inspiring use,
and I love to see the

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:07.860
coordination between the
different devices there.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.215
So you've got the controller
and the Wii itself

00:06:10.215 --> 00:06:13.060
displaying up here.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.920
It's a really great
implementation.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:15.400
DANIEL SIEBERG: Great.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.570
I just want to know when Mario
is going to show up in one of

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.220
the Street View scenes.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.330
RYAN LUND: We take feature
requests, but I can't promise

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:22.110
that we'll get him in.

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.540
DANIEL SIEBERG: Cool.

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.850
Great.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:23.510
Thank you so much.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.994
MANO MARKS: Thanks a lot.

00:06:23.994 --> 00:06:25.244
RYAN LUND: Thank you.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.510
DANIEL SIEBERG: All right.

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.090
We're going to dive into
our next partner now.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:34.970
In fact, we're going to map dive
into our next partner.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:36.500
This is a new term that
I'm learning here.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.130
Mano joins me again, and
Ben from Instrument.

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:40.620
So Mano, talk to me a little
bit about what we're

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:41.320
seeing behind us.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.640
I know that these are familiar
to Googlers, this Liquid

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.560
Galaxy Display, but this is a
unique way of presenting it.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.260
MANO MARKS: So Liquid
Galaxy is actually a

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.120
collection of hardware.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.580
We actually open source the
plans on how to build this, so

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.750
anybody could theoretically
build this as long as they're

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.720
willing to invest
in the hardware.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.180
And it's a way of getting a
bunch of different computers

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.500
and screens to synchronize
together so you can do this

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.810
kind of large scale display.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:09.710
And the instrument folks have
done a great application

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.620
called Google Map Dive--

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.960
and you can actually see this
in the background--

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.600
and this is all using HTML5
and the JavaScript API.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.110
So why don't you tell us a
little bit more about it?

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.540
BEN PURDY: All right.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.080
So what you're seeing behind
me here is all running in

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:24.680
Google Chrome.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.080
We've got seven separate
instances of Chrome each

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.950
running on a separate PC, and
they're all being synchronized

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:31.130
through web sockets.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:34.120
The game itself is running on
an additional machine that's

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.450
hidden behind these displays
here, and it's sort of keeping

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:38.790
track of the game state and then
broadcasting that out to

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:42.100
all seven of the display
nodes over web sockets.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.400
And so the 3D game content
that you can see the

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.360
foreground is a WebGL layer with
a transparent background,

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.180
and behind that, we have a live
HTML Google Maps region

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.650
that is transformed
using 3D CSS.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:58.060
And so using 3.JS, we're able
to synchronize the camera

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:02.150
between the WebGL view and the
3D CSS view, and so what we

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:04.090
get is this really
cohesive scene.

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:06.880
We're able to stitch the image
between all seven monitors

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.070
just by offsetting the camera
between each display.

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:10.180
DANIEL SIEBERG: So this is
an entirely accurate

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.550
representation of Google Maps?

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:14.604
BEN PURDY: Yeah, you're seeing
a live Google Map.

00:08:14.604 --> 00:08:15.076
MANO MARKS: Yeah.

00:08:15.076 --> 00:08:17.920
And in fact, the first question
a lot of people ask

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.860
you is, is this term
compliant?

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:21.010
BEN PURDY: Yes, it is
term complaint.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:22.810
We're not accessing
tiles directly.

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:25.770
If I hadn't turned off the User
Interface Events, you'd

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:28.230
be able to drag that map around
if you had a mouse.

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:30.610
So the reason it looks a little
nontraditional is that

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:34.880
we've used the Styling API
extensively to create these

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.860
custom themes for each of the
maps, but it is an actual

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:39.270
Google Map.

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:40.799
The way we're doing the
sky haze, that kind

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:43.750
of causes some suspicion.

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:47.530
That's an OpenGL layer in the
WebGL view that's simply

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:50.630
fading from transparent to the
sky color that we've chosen.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.620
And that way, we hide the hard
edges of the corners.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.070
DANIEL SIEBERG: Clearly this is
a lot of fun and a lot of

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:55.970
people like us would like
it in their living room.

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:57.570
What's the future of this?

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:58.360
Where is it going?

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.690
BEN PURDY: Well, our plan right
now is to clean up the

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:03.490
code a little bit and
get it running in a

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:04.540
single browser instance.

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.200
Right now, it's sort of
distributed where we have the

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.750
server and the client separate
and talking over web sockets.

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.310
But we're going to do some
refactoring and get it running

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:14.380
in a single browser window, and
then we'd like to release

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.110
it and open source it and maybe
put it up on Chrome

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:17.365
Experiments or something
like that.

00:09:17.365 --> 00:09:19.470
DANIEL SIEBERG: Where does this
rank in the uniqueness of

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:20.700
what some of the partners
are doing?

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:21.310
This seems pretty awesome.

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:24.280
MANO MARKS: This is
pretty high up.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.970
We've got a really great
sandbox this year.

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:32.090
This is pretty amazing,
pretty impressive.

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:34.380
Really, really great
to see this.

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.160
BEN PURDY: I don't know if
you're watching this remotely,

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.160
but if you are here somewhere,
you should come and play it.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:38.520
It's a lot of fun.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:38.800
DANIEL SIEBERG: Exactly.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:39.930
All right, cool.

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:41.110
Ben, thank you so much.

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:41.200
BEN PURDY: Sure.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.090
Appreciate it.

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:43.340
MANO MARKS: Thanks, Ben.

00:09:48.664 --> 00:09:51.250
DANIEL SIEBERG: Well, I forgot
that I loaned my car out to do

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:53.190
this next demo, I wish.

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:56.020
We're actually over at the
Mercedes Benz part of the Map

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.840
Sandbox, and I'm joined now by
Chris from Mercedes Benz to

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.310
talk about some really cool
navigation features that are

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:02.190
built into this car.

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:03.350
First of all, what are we
sitting in right now?

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:06.050
CHRIS BUSENBARK: So right
now, this is an SL 550.

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:08.040
It's a pretty payment, so--

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:08.860
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah.

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:09.910
It's on the wish list.

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.990
CHRIS BUSENBARK: It's
on the wish list.

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:11.680
LOUIS GRAY: So tell me about
this screen that we're looking

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.430
at right here and
what it can do.

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:15.940
CHRIS BUSENBARK: So this current
screen, we want to

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:20.000
show off our Google APIs that
we've implemented in this app.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.940
All this right now is powered
by a smartphone.

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:25.060
All the cellular data, all the
network requests are going

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:26.470
over the cellular data.

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:28.390
So we basically just
use this head unit

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:31.180
just for drawing stuff.

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:34.790
So this place is powered by
Google Tile that we have here.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:38.900
What it does is it takes away
the tedious address entry of

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.340
enter in your city, enter in
your state, enter in your

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.380
house number.

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:46.360
So what we can do here is we
can select this tile and we

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.870
can set a destination.

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:53.010
So for example, let's just type
in "8", like we want to

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:54.520
go to 88 Howard.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:59.120
So what we do, we type in "8"
and it autocompletes each time

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.240
we type in a letter, and this
takes away us having to enter

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:06.580
in the location, the city, the
street, and all that stuff.

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:06.780
DANIEL SIEBERG: Right.

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:08.556
And all of this is being
done with this--

00:11:08.556 --> 00:11:09.880
what do you want to call it,
jog wheel down here?

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:10.280
CHRIS BUSENBARK: Right.

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:13.480
We call it a CCE, but rotary
knob, whatever you

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.050
want to call it.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:18.040
So we can just type in a random
address, so let's do

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.720
like five, six, and
56th Street

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.720
DANIEL SIEBERG: So it's already
suggesting ones that

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.140
would [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:22.430
CHRIS BUSENBARK: Correct.

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:24.470
So 562 Sutter Street.

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:29.200
We can select this, and now what
we can do is we can view

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.450
Street View of this location.

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:34.670
And now since we have a rotary
knob here, what we can do is

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:38.855
do a whole 360 degrees of the
Street View, which allows for

00:11:38.855 --> 00:11:40.930
a very intuitive kind
of experience.

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:42.440
DANIEL SIEBERG: So you can
really see, before you even

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.720
get there, what to expect.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:44.970
CHRIS BUSENBARK: Correct.

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:49.480
It's just an awesome feature.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:52.280
It really helps to be able to
quickly go through the tiles

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.110
that are returned.

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:56.140
Another feature we have is
the View All Map feature.

00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:01.180
So this uses the Google Maps
SDK, and what it does is

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:04.270
allows you to see the general
area of the PoI.

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:06.710
So you can zoom out,
you can zoom in.

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:09.200
If you zoom in far enough, you
get the pretty little 3D

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.355
buildings that makes it-- ooh.

00:12:11.355 --> 00:12:13.520
DANIEL SIEBERG: Sure, sure,
just like you would on a

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:14.440
device, a mobile device.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.780
CHRIS BUSENBARK: Exactly.

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:19.790
So this gives you a general
idea of where stuff is.

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:23.200
So this search can also
handle categories.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.740
So what we can do is we can
search general pizza.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:30.230
So this will actually return
us results of all the pizza

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:33.010
places that are currently
around us.

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:35.640
It gives us the star rating that
is returned, the price,

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.660
and the distance from us.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:41.690
So for example, we'll select
this pizza place and it gives

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:44.040
us a couple more details such
as when it's opened, and we

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.040
can actually call the place
too if we wanted to

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.370
preorder our pizza.

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:48.790
It gives us the same features.

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:50.910
It has Street View in it,
viewing it on the map.

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:51.600
And also, photos.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.850
DANIEL SIEBERG: User
generated photos?

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:54.390
CHRIS BUSENBARK: So these are
user generated photos that are

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:55.840
uploaded to Google.

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:59.001
Someone had a very good green
onion pizza here.

00:12:59.001 --> 00:13:02.180
And you can just scroll through
them just to see if

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:05.160
you want to go to that place.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.320
And that covers our Autocomplete
feature.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.530
Another feature we want to
highlight on is our Traffic.

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:15.640
This also uses the
Google Maps SDK.

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:19.350
It's just like your typical
experience when you're looking

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:21.160
at Google Traffic on the
web or the browser.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.780
You know what the
color lines are.

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:26.380
While you're driving, you can
pan around, see what the

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:29.160
traffic is on the bridge, zoom
in on the bridge just in case

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.320
you don't see the right color.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:30.860
DANIEL SIEBERG: Doesn't look
too bad right now.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:31.840
CHRIS BUSENBARK: Doesn't
look too bad.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:32.730
It will later, right?

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:34.850
Everyone's going home.

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:35.380
DANIEL SIEBERG: Let's move on.

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.050
We've just got a little time
left if you can show us the

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:37.610
last feature.

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:38.760
CHRIS BUSENBARK: So the last
thing is a City Guide.

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:43.660
So what this is, it allows you
just to view a variety of

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:45.010
categories around you.

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:48.500
So you can say, I want to know
the nightlife around me.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:51.290
And so you can select this,
and it returns basically--

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:54.340
as you know a weather
map, green means

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:55.290
light, red means heavy.

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:56.810
In this case, white
means heavy.

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:59.070
So you know underneath that
white little area, there's a

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:01.160
lot of night life and
so you can go there.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:01.390
DANIEL SIEBERG: Cool.

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:02.210
All right.

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:02.980
Put your seat belts on.

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:03.650
We are out of here.

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:04.230
CHRIS BUSENBARK: We're
out of here.

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:05.000
DANIEL SIEBERG: Thank
you so much, Chris.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.910
That's going to do it for here
at the Maps Sandbox with

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:08.880
Google Developers Live.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:11.530
Stay tuned for lots more
content right here.

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:19.060
I think I'm going to become
a professional

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:20.410
map diver after that.

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:21.300
And just a quick shout out.

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.260
If you want to check out the new
Google Maps, remember to

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.540
go to maps.google.com/preview
and sign up.

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:26.860
LOUIS GRAY: Great.

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:27.890
Thanks for the preview.

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:30.870
We'll be right back at 2:20
to talk Chromebook Pixel.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.120
Enjoy your sessions.
