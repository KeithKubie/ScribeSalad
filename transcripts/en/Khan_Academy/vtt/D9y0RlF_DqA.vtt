00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:01.730
Good morning.

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:02.900
It's February already.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.760
I'm back from my hiatus.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.020
I was so burned out doing all
those SAT problems. But now

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.840
I'm ready and I will start
doing some physics.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.950
So we had done a bunch of
projectile motion, what

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.310
happens you throw something
in the air or

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.270
drop it from a cliff.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.990
But now I want to introduce you
to is how do you actually

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.080
affect the acceleration
of an object?

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.560
And to do that I'm going to
introduce you to Newton's

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.810
three laws.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.660
To some degree what we were
doing before was derivative of

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.550
what I'm going to do now.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.720
But this is kind of the backbone
of classical physics.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.510
So Newton's three laws.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.950
And you've probably heard
of these before.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.820
Newtow's three laws.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.270
Sometimes they're called
Newton's Laws of Motion.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.160
I've actually looked this up on
the web just to make sure

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.520
and see if there's any correct
way of writing it, but every

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.470
website seems to have
a different

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.430
paraphrase of the laws.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.480
But hopefully, I can give
you an intuitive sense

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.310
of what they are.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:08.010
So the first law is an object
at rest. An object at rest

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:21.250
tends to stay at rest. And
an object in motion

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.430
tends to stay in motion.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.520
This is what I learned when I
was a kid and now when I look

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.110
at Wikipedia and things, there
are some paraphrases.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.720
And we'll go over those
paraphrases because I think

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.740
they're instructive.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.910
Stay in motion.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.690
And you might say, Sal,
this is obvious.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.300
Why does Newton get
so much credit

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.130
for stating the obvious?

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.020
Obviously, if I look at my sofa
for example, it is an

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.030
object at rest and if I keep
staring at it, it tends to

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.590
stay at rest. Likewise, when
I look at a car crossing an

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.170
intersection-- that's not a red
light, that's crossing an

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.520
intersection, it's an
object in motion.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.040
And then, I don't know-- 10
seconds later, it's still

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.480
staying in motion and of course,
it will stay in motion

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.120
unless you press the
brakes or whatever.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.620
So you might say, well
Sal, this is the most

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:06.670
obvious thing ever.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.380
This doesn't even need
to be written down.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.840
But let's say you were Newton
and you came to me-- it was in

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.060
the 17th century.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.790
And you said, Sal, I have
these new laws.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.630
And the first is an object at
rest tends to stay at rest,

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.860
and an object in motion tends
to stay in motion.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.290
And I would say Newton, I can
already disprove your law.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.140
Let's say I have an apple and
I'm holding it up at let's say

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.270
my-- I'm holding it up with
my arm, so it's roughly my

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.720
shoulder level.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.800
So I'm holding an apple.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.690
This is an apple.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.530
Looks like a heart,
but it's an apple.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.610
So I'm holding it with my hand,
I'm drawing my hand.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.170
I don't know if that makes sense
to you, but I'm holding

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.010
it with my hand.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.760
And what happens when I
let go of that apple?

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.890
So while I'm holding it with
my hand it's an object at

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.180
rest, right?

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.490
But then when I let
go, what happens?

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:53.740
It falls.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:54.840
Falls to the ground.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.990
So I'll say, Newton, I just
disproved your first law.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.170
Because this was an object at
rest. And I did nothing to it.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.980
I just let go.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.680
I didn't apply, I didn't push
it, I didn't pull it.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.400
I didn't throw it.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.480
I didn't do anything.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.610
And when I let go it just
fell to the ground.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.100
It started moving without me
doing anything, even though it

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.410
was an object at rest.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.610
And then Newton will say, oh,
well that's because there's a

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:16.660
thing called gravity.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:17.670
And it's the force of gravity.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.690
And I would say, Newton, you
need to start to learn to not

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.480
make up things.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.350
Just because you're law doesn't
make sense, you don't

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.960
need to make up artificial
forces in the universe.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.410
But anyway, he would
end up being right.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.700
And the way to think about this,
if I did this exact same

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:41.090
experiment while I was in space
and let's just say-- I

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.260
was going to say orbit because
it would look like that, but

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.190
even orbit is kind of a-- you're
still kind of falling

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.000
towards the earth, it's just
you're moving-- well, I won't

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.520
go into that.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.060
I'll go into orbit
at another time.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.850
But let's say we were just in
deep space and me and the

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.870
apple were just floating
around in space.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.100
Maybe we're stationary.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.690
It's hard to say.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.620
We're floating with
respect to what?

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.530
And then, if we're in space and
I let go of this apple,

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.090
what happens to the apple?

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.590
Nothing.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:08.690
It's not going to
fall anywhere.

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:09.950
It's not going to move.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.260
And so whenever you think about
Newton's laws-- and

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.440
that's why this is so amazing.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.330
He didn't know about space.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.570
He's living in this planet that
everything tends to fall

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.850
and things start moving for no
reason because of whatever,

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.470
gravity, and the wind
and whatever else.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.580
And he actually theorized that
there could be a place where

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.030
there's no forces acting on
objects where if I were to let

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.260
go of this apple, it would
just stay where it is.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.060
And similarly, the
object in motion

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.970
tends to stay in motion.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.820
And there again I would've
told Newton, well, that

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:38.850
doesn't make sense.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.920
If I were to-- I don't know.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:47.470
If I were to push a-- well, I
don't know if they had bowling

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:48.200
balls back then.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.730
But if I were to roll a bowling
ball down a-- well

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.870
let's say up a hill-- At some
point that bowling ball's

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.120
going to slow down.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.960
If I rolled it up a hill,
at some point it's just

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:01.590
going to slow down.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.570
And maybe if I got it right it
would just stop at the top if

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.500
I did it perfectly.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.170
And I could say, look, this
was an object in motion.

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.750
At some point it stops or it
actually turns back around.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.990
Or even if I were to roll it
this way, at some point it's

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.860
just going to stop.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.610
Right The bowling ball's
going to stop.

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.080
If I were to push something as
hard as I could, maybe it

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.900
travels for a couple of feet,
but then it's going to stop.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.730
And he'll say, oh, well you
know, there's these forces

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.230
that you're not realizing
there's a force.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.100
There's the wind resistance in
the bowling ball example.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.250
There's the force of friction
in the example where I just

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.540
pushed something.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.370
And I would've said, well
Newton, you're just making up

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:37.340
these forces again.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.690
And this is why this is
so not intuitive.

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.400
Because he had to essentially
realize that there were all of

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.280
these forces acting on something
when to someone at

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.110
that time, you wouldn't have
realized that and you wouldn't

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.420
have been able to even conceive
that there's a place

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.830
called space, for example,
where these

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.100
things wouldn't happen.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.820
If I push something in space,
it will keep going.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.900
It would be an object in motion
and it will keep that

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.800
velocity until some other
force acts on it.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.860
So it wasn't that intuitive.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:13.050
And so a more modern way to
write this is to say that

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.440
there is a frame of reference,
there exists a frame of

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.460
reference-- and I'll explain
what a frame of reference is.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.810
But there exists a frame of
reference where this is true.

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.530
That could be the new way
of saying Newton's

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.160
first law of motion.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.850
So what's a frame
of reference?

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.430
So everything in physics--
if I'm moving,

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.710
moving relative to what?

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.290
Moving relative to
the observer?

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:36.480
Moving relative to the earth?

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.490
You don't know.

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.700
So a frame of reference is what
is the observer doing?

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:45.870
So example: when I'm in space
and I let go of the apple, me

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.810
and the apple are kind of in
this-- I am observing the

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.420
apple from what I call an
inertial frame of reference.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:53.850
So this is a frame of reference
actually where

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.380
Newton's laws hold.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:00.210
If I take the apple on earth and
I let go and it drops, the

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.450
reason why this first law didn't
hold is because I'm not

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.450
really in an inertial
frame of reference.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:08.190
Because me and the apple are
both constantly being pulled

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.590
on by this force
called gravity.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.610
So although it looks like
nothing's going on, me and the

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.260
apple are in the same--
nothing's really acting on us.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:17.830
There is.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:19.380
There's this force
of acceleration.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.930
Similarly, if I'm in a
car and that car is

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:22.880
accelerating, right?

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:28.085
So let's say the car-- looks
more like a pickup truck, so

00:07:28.085 --> 00:07:29.335
I'll go with the pickup truck.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.425
Let's say you have a pair of
dice hanging from your rear

00:07:36.425 --> 00:07:37.510
view mirror.

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:38.950
This is the dice right here.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.890
What happens when the
car accelerates?

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:44.150
Well the dice move
back, right?

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:48.810
And so when you're sitting in
the truck itself, it looks

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:50.670
like the dice are just
moving back.

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.110
No one's really doing
anything to it.

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.950
Let's say the car had no windows
and you would just all

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:58.573
of a sudden mysteriously feel--
well, you'd feel a

00:07:58.573 --> 00:08:00.600
little squeezing on your chest
too, but you would also just

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.020
see these dice move back.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.300
And you'd say, hey.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.040
Newton's first law
doesn't hold.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.100
And what I would say is well
that's because you're in a

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.980
non-inertial frame
of reference.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.170
To someone outside of the truck,
they would see, oh

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:13.660
well, the truck is moving, the
truck is actually accelerating

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.150
and that's why the
dice move back.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:20.210
So in I guess you could say the
horizontal dimension, and

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:21.980
I'm probably just confusing you,
but I want to give you a

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.660
really intuitive feel about why
this isn't so intuitive.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:28.940
In the horizontal direction,
because there are no forces of

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:32.760
gravity or whatever acting in
this direction, and if I'm

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.880
outside of the truck, I could
then-- I would be in an

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.900
inertial frame of reference
in at least

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:38.860
the horizontal dimension.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.159
I mean we always have gravity
pulling down on us.

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:43.870
But from the outside of the
truck, I could observe that

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:48.080
oh, you know, Newton's law holds
because the whole frame

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.340
of reference, this truck is
actually being accelerated.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.440
So me being outside of that, I
would be in an inertial frame

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.870
of reference.

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:58.570
Hopefully I haven't confused
you too much.

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:00.710
The way to think about it is
that an inertial frame of

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:03.860
reference is just a frame of
reference where there's no

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:07.070
outside forces acting on the
whole frame of reference.

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:10.870
And a frame of reference
is just what is

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:11.680
the observer doing?

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.450
What am I doing?

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:13.900
Am I moving with the object?

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:15.760
Am I being accelerated
with the object?

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:19.840
Or, are neither me nor the
object being acted upon?

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.245
And that's the way to
think about it.

00:09:22.245 --> 00:09:23.270
Oh, I already ran out of time.

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:24.540
I only got one law done.

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.570
So I'll see you in
the next video.
