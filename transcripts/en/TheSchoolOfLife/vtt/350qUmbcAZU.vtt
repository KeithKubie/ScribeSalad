00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.860
Anyone who lives alone and manifests no longing to be in a relationship

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.520
is in our times, almost automatically, more or less secretly

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.180
viewed as both pitiable and deeply troubled.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.100
It's simply not thought possible to be at once, alone and normal.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.020
This sets up for collective catastrophe,

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.360
because it means that a huge number of people,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.140
who have no innate wish to live with anyone else,

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.160
and are thought deeply ill-suited to doing so

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.000
are every year press ganged and shamed into conjugal life

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.380
with disastrous results for all involved.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.840
Only once singlehood has completely equal prestige with its alternative

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.080
can we ensure that people will be free in their choices

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.180
and hence join couples for the right reasons; because they love another person,

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.820
rather than because they are terrified of remaining single.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.720
Here, then, are a few of the many good reasons to spend your life alone:

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.160
1. Because romantic love is a dangerous illusion.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.820
We should recognize that romantic love

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.780
the idea of being deeply enamored of one special partner over a whole lifetime,

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.440
is a very new, ambitious and really pretty odd concept, at best 250 years old.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.160
From close-up, over long periods of time,

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.600
almost everyone is condemned to be pretty dispiriting and difficult

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.600
A good Romantic marriage is evidently theoretically possible,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.700
but it's also be extremely unlikely in practice,

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.140
which should make any failure feel a good deal less shameful.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.740
2. No one thinks their partner is terrific - After a while.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.500
Those among us who chose to stay single should not be thought un-Romantic.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.760
Indeed, we may be among the very most Romantic of all,

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.580
because it is in the end the fervent Romantics

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.960
who should be especially careful of ending up in mediocre relationships:

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.000
relationships best suit the kind of people

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.860
who don’t actually expect too much from them.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.540
3. We aren't sane enough to be in relationships.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.820
Though it is a sign of some maturity to know how to love and live alongside someone,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.400
it it is actually a sign of even greater maturity

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.520
to recognise that this is something one isn’t in the end

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.920
going to be psychologically capable of – as a good portion of us simply are not.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.380
Retiring oneself voluntarily,

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.700
in order to save others (and oneself)

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.360
from the consequences of one’s own inner emotional turmoil

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.060
is the true sign of a great and kind soul.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.860
4. Being alone means not inflicting yourself on others.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.320
It spares you from constant reminders of how difficult and strange you are.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.960
No one is there to hold a mirror up – record your antics

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.240
and constantly make you accountable for them.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.020
If you’re lucky, you will be able to tolerate and even like yourself if you are on your own.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
5. Relationships spoil love.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.360
It may be better to feel alone and be denied sex outside of a relationship

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.880
than inside one.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.400
One thing the single are never denied,

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.800
is hope.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.620
All this isn’t to say that being alone is without problems.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.400
There are of course drawbacks to both states,

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.520
being single and being in a couple:

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.180
loneliness in the one;

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.460
suffocation, anger and frustration in the other.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.780
The truth is, we’re simply not terribly good at being happy whatever our relationship status.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.680
Which is ultimately an argument for neither rushing too fast into a couple,

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.460
or rushing too fast out of one.
