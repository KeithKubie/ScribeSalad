00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.090
What resources can partners bring?

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.270
Well, obviously if they have something you need

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.180
that you normally would have to develop

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.370
and they would sell to you or license to you,

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.120
that allows for you to get to market faster.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.620
Or, it might be a complementary product or service

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.090
that you just couldn't afford to build or can't get around to for a while,

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.590
and that allows you to offer a broader product offering.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.300
Or, yes you could do it, and you could probably do it in the same time,

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.180
buy why do something that's their expertise with your money?

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.320
It might just be easy to buy their product, integrate it in yours,

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.680
and now all of a sudden you're no longer doing their invention

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.310
but focusing on your core business.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.950
For start-ups, trying to understand what it is you want to focus on

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:51.170
versus what is it you require in terms of activities and resources and suppliers

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.830
is a real strategy. Partnerships are not kind of an add-on.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.410
They really allow you to capitalize on the unique customer knowledge

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.230
or expertise of others.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.160
The final reason is, they might be channel partners

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.740
or they might be partners overseas to new markets

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.250
that you weren't planning to get to this year or even this decade

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.280
and allows you to generate a source of income

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.920
that would be unavailable to you for years.
