00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.070
Gas is expensive.

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:02.830
So it's good to know about mileage.

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.310
Let's say Melissa and
Shanice are comparing their cars.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.615
Melissa's car goes 343 miles
with 15 gallons of gas.

00:00:10.615 --> 00:00:14.250
Shanice's car goes 300
miles on 12 gallons of gas.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.755
I want to know what is
the gas mileage of each car?

00:00:17.755 --> 00:00:20.170
Enter you answer in these
boxes in miles per gallon.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:21.980
And I've already given you the unit.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.130
So you just have to enter the number.
