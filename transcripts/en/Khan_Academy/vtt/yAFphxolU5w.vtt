00:00:00.373 --> 00:00:02.927
- [Voiceover] Let's say we
have the function f of x

00:00:02.927 --> 00:00:07.094
which is equal to cosine
of x to the third power

00:00:08.477 --> 00:00:10.561
which we could also write like this,

00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:13.394
cosine of x to the third power.

00:00:14.846 --> 00:00:16.892
And we are interested in figuring out

00:00:16.892 --> 00:00:21.139
what f prime of x is going to be equal to.

00:00:21.139 --> 00:00:25.751
So we want to figure out f
prime of x and as we will see,

00:00:25.751 --> 00:00:28.574
the chain rule is going
to be very useful here

00:00:28.574 --> 00:00:29.407
and what I'm going to do is

00:00:29.407 --> 00:00:31.235
I'm going to first just
apply the chain rule

00:00:31.235 --> 00:00:32.489
and then maybe dig into it a little bit

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.052
to make sure we draw the connection

00:00:34.052 --> 00:00:36.327
between what we're doing here
and then what you might see

00:00:36.327 --> 00:00:38.163
in maybe some of your Calculus textbooks

00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:39.958
that explain the chain rule.

00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:42.328
So if we have a function

00:00:42.328 --> 00:00:45.264
that is defined as essentially
a composite function,

00:00:45.264 --> 00:00:47.880
notice this expression right here,

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.410
we are taking something
to the third power.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.534
It isn't just an x that we're
taking to the third power.

00:00:52.534 --> 00:00:55.475
We are taking a cosine
of x to the third power.

00:00:55.475 --> 00:00:57.601
So we're taking a function,
you could view it this way,

00:00:57.601 --> 00:00:59.643
we're taking the function cosine of x

00:00:59.643 --> 00:01:01.847
and then we're inputting
it in to another function

00:01:01.847 --> 00:01:04.788
that takes it to the third power.

00:01:04.788 --> 00:01:06.218
So let me put it this way.

00:01:06.218 --> 00:01:07.940
If you viewed,

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.430
if you say, look, we could take an x,

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.430
we put it into one function and that is,

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.086
that first function is cosine of x

00:01:17.086 --> 00:01:19.753
so first, we evaluate the cosine

00:01:21.008 --> 00:01:24.520
and so that's going to
produce cosine of x,

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.316
cosine of x,

00:01:26.316 --> 00:01:28.804
and then we're going to
input it into a function

00:01:28.804 --> 00:01:31.301
that just takes things to the third power.

00:01:31.301 --> 00:01:34.365
So it just takes things
to the third power.

00:01:34.365 --> 00:01:36.806
And so what are you going to end up with?

00:01:36.806 --> 00:01:38.263
Well, you're going to end up with,

00:01:38.263 --> 00:01:39.572
what are you taking to the third power?

00:01:39.572 --> 00:01:41.741
You're taking cosine of x.

00:01:41.741 --> 00:01:44.840
Cosine of x to the third power.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.763
This is a composite function.

00:01:47.763 --> 00:01:50.022
You could view this,

00:01:50.022 --> 00:01:52.945
you could view this as the function,

00:01:52.945 --> 00:01:55.476
let's call this blue one, the function v

00:01:55.476 --> 00:01:58.743
and let's call this the function u

00:01:58.743 --> 00:02:01.679
and so if we're taking x and into u,

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:02.846
this is u of x

00:02:04.251 --> 00:02:07.273
and then if we're taking
u of x into the input

00:02:07.273 --> 00:02:09.600
or as the input into the function v

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.787
then this output right over here,

00:02:11.787 --> 00:02:13.870
this is going to be v of,

00:02:15.562 --> 00:02:16.910
well, what was inputted?

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:17.910
V of u of x.

00:02:18.872 --> 00:02:19.789
V of u of x

00:02:21.932 --> 00:02:23.528
or another way of writing it,

00:02:23.528 --> 00:02:24.713
I'm going to write it multiple ways.

00:02:24.713 --> 00:02:28.430
That's the same thing as v of cosine of x.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.847
V of cosine of x.

00:02:31.535 --> 00:02:33.619
And so v, whatever you input into it,

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:35.336
it just takes it to the third power.

00:02:35.336 --> 00:02:36.358
If you were to write v of x,

00:02:36.358 --> 00:02:38.634
it would be x to the third power.

00:02:38.634 --> 00:02:40.036
So the chain rule tells us

00:02:40.036 --> 00:02:41.997
or the chain rule is what
our brain should say.

00:02:41.997 --> 00:02:44.203
Hey, it becomes applicable

00:02:44.203 --> 00:02:46.203
if we're going to take the
derivative of a function

00:02:46.203 --> 00:02:49.753
that can be expressed as a
composite function like this.

00:02:49.753 --> 00:02:53.795
So just to be clear, we can write f of x.

00:02:53.795 --> 00:02:56.628
f of x is equal to v of u of x.

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:00.232
I know I'm essentially
saying the same thing

00:03:00.232 --> 00:03:01.148
over and over again

00:03:01.148 --> 00:03:02.324
but I'm saying it in
slightly different ways

00:03:02.324 --> 00:03:03.755
because the first time you learn this,

00:03:03.755 --> 00:03:05.794
it can be a little bit hard to grok

00:03:05.794 --> 00:03:08.042
or really deeply understand

00:03:08.042 --> 00:03:10.738
so I'm going to try to
write it in different ways.

00:03:10.738 --> 00:03:12.699
And the chain rule tells us

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:14.862
that if you have a situation like this

00:03:14.862 --> 00:03:17.960
then the derivative, f prime of x,

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.247
and this is something that you
will see in your textbooks.

00:03:20.247 --> 00:03:21.541
Well, this is going to be

00:03:21.541 --> 00:03:24.490
the derivative of this whole thing

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:25.920
with respect to u of x

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.587
so we could write that
as v prime of u of x.

00:03:30.614 --> 00:03:32.031
V prime of u of x

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:37.247
times the derivative
of u with respect to x.

00:03:37.247 --> 00:03:38.830
Times u prime of x.

00:03:40.307 --> 00:03:41.411
This right over here,

00:03:41.411 --> 00:03:45.379
this is one expression of the chain rule

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:48.637
and so how do we evaluate it in this case?

00:03:48.637 --> 00:03:50.927
Well, let me color code
it in a similar way.

00:03:50.927 --> 00:03:52.889
So the v function,

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:54.932
this outer thing that just
takes things to the third power,

00:03:54.932 --> 00:03:56.034
I'll put in blue.

00:03:56.034 --> 00:03:57.709
So f prime of x,

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.788
another way of expressing it

00:03:59.788 --> 00:04:02.360
and I'll use it with more of
the differential notation,

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.367
you could view this as the derivative of,

00:04:06.367 --> 00:04:07.955
well, I'll write it a
couple of different ways.

00:04:07.955 --> 00:04:11.965
You could view it as the derivative of v.

00:04:11.965 --> 00:04:13.548
The derivative of v

00:04:16.095 --> 00:04:17.595
with respect to u.

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:20.618
I want to get the colors right.

00:04:20.618 --> 00:04:23.785
The derivative of v with respect to u,

00:04:26.361 --> 00:04:28.940
that's what this thing is right over here,

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.023
times the derivative of u

00:04:32.178 --> 00:04:33.678
with respect to x.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.114
So times the derivative
of u with respect to x.

00:04:39.114 --> 00:04:40.185
And just to be clear,

00:04:40.185 --> 00:04:41.774
so you're familiar with
the different notations

00:04:41.774 --> 00:04:43.388
you'll see in different textbooks,

00:04:43.388 --> 00:04:47.943
this is this right over here
just using different notations

00:04:47.943 --> 00:04:50.693
and this is this right over here.

00:04:51.861 --> 00:04:53.777
So let's actually evaluate these things.

00:04:53.777 --> 00:04:56.730
You're probably tired of
just talking in the abstract.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.649
So this is going to be equal to,

00:04:59.649 --> 00:05:01.533
this is going to be equal to

00:05:01.533 --> 00:05:02.762
and I'm going to write it out again,

00:05:02.762 --> 00:05:05.007
this is the derivative,

00:05:05.007 --> 00:05:06.724
instead of just writing v and u,

00:05:06.724 --> 00:05:08.928
I'm going to write it,
let me write this way.

00:05:08.928 --> 00:05:10.697
This is going to be,

00:05:10.697 --> 00:05:13.056
I keep wanting, I'm
using the wrong colors.

00:05:13.056 --> 00:05:15.790
This is going to be the derivative of,

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.057
and I'm going to leave some space,

00:05:17.057 --> 00:05:20.070
times the derivative of something else

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.121
with respect to something else

00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:23.820
so we're going to have to
first take the derivative of v.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:24.653
Well, v is

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.191
cosine of x to the third power.

00:05:29.191 --> 00:05:30.344
Cosine of x.

00:05:30.344 --> 00:05:31.474
We're going to take the derivative of that

00:05:31.474 --> 00:05:35.287
with respect to u which
is just cosine of x

00:05:35.287 --> 00:05:36.267
and we're going to multiply that

00:05:36.267 --> 00:05:40.140
times the derivative of
u which is cosine of x

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.230
with respect to x.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.519
With respect to x.

00:05:44.519 --> 00:05:46.686
So this one, we have good,

00:05:47.943 --> 00:05:50.117
we've seen this before.

00:05:50.117 --> 00:05:53.129
We know that the derivative
with respect to x

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:54.379
of cosine of x.

00:05:56.284 --> 00:05:57.525
Cosine.

00:05:57.525 --> 00:05:59.728
We use it in that same color.

00:05:59.728 --> 00:06:02.666
The derivative of cosine of x,

00:06:02.666 --> 00:06:05.529
well, that's equal to negative sine of x.

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:09.693
So this one right over here,
that is negative sine of x.

00:06:09.693 --> 00:06:11.247
You might be more familiar with seeing

00:06:11.247 --> 00:06:13.004
the derivative operated this way

00:06:13.004 --> 00:06:15.536
but in theory, you won't see this as often

00:06:15.536 --> 00:06:17.906
but this helps my brain
really grok what we're doing.

00:06:17.906 --> 00:06:19.295
We're taking the derivative of cosine of x

00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:20.845
with respect to x.

00:06:20.845 --> 00:06:22.681
Well, that's going to
be negative sine of x.

00:06:22.681 --> 00:06:24.008
Well, what about taking the derivative

00:06:24.008 --> 00:06:26.831
of cosine of x to the third power

00:06:26.831 --> 00:06:29.005
with respect to cosine of x?

00:06:29.005 --> 00:06:31.647
What is this thing over here mean?

00:06:31.647 --> 00:06:34.067
Well, if I were taking the derivative,

00:06:34.067 --> 00:06:37.701
if I was taking the derivative of,

00:06:37.701 --> 00:06:38.534
let me write it this way,

00:06:38.534 --> 00:06:43.122
if I was taking the derivative
of x to the third power,

00:06:43.122 --> 00:06:46.839
x to the third power with respect to x,

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:48.296
if it was like that,

00:06:48.296 --> 00:06:50.435
well, this is just going to be

00:06:50.435 --> 00:06:51.538
and let me put some brackets here

00:06:51.538 --> 00:06:52.768
to make it a little bit clear.

00:06:52.768 --> 00:06:55.546
If I'm taking the derivative of that,

00:06:55.546 --> 00:06:57.327
that is going to be,

00:06:57.327 --> 00:06:58.160
that is going to be,

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.711
we bring the exponent out front.

00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:01.705
That's going to be three,

00:07:01.705 --> 00:07:02.872
three times x.

00:07:05.185 --> 00:07:08.446
Three times x to the second power.

00:07:08.446 --> 00:07:12.082
Three times x to the second power.

00:07:12.082 --> 00:07:14.386
So the general notion here is

00:07:14.386 --> 00:07:17.426
if I'm taking the derivative of something,

00:07:17.426 --> 00:07:19.060
whatever this something happens to be,

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:20.287
let me do this in a new color.

00:07:20.287 --> 00:07:24.371
I'm doing the derivative of
orange circle to the third power

00:07:24.371 --> 00:07:27.159
with respect to orange circle.

00:07:27.159 --> 00:07:29.804
Well, that's just going
to be three times orange

00:07:29.804 --> 00:07:31.195
or yellow circle.

00:07:31.195 --> 00:07:33.116
Let me make it an actual orange circle.

00:07:33.116 --> 00:07:36.225
So the derivative of orange
circle to the third power

00:07:36.225 --> 00:07:38.834
with respect to orange circle,

00:07:38.834 --> 00:07:42.344
that's going to be three times
the orange circle squared.

00:07:42.344 --> 00:07:44.101
So if I'm taking the
derivative of cosine of x

00:07:44.101 --> 00:07:47.293
to the third power with
respect to cosine of x,

00:07:47.293 --> 00:07:48.928
well, that's just going to be,

00:07:48.928 --> 00:07:50.928
this is just going to be

00:07:51.797 --> 00:07:53.797
three times cosine of x,

00:07:55.407 --> 00:07:58.324
cosine of x to the second power.

00:07:59.452 --> 00:08:01.119
To the second power.

00:08:02.642 --> 00:08:04.072
Notice, one way to think about it.

00:08:04.072 --> 00:08:06.399
I'm taking the derivative
of this outside function

00:08:06.399 --> 00:08:07.991
with respect to the inside.

00:08:07.991 --> 00:08:09.623
So I would do the same thing

00:08:09.623 --> 00:08:11.501
as taking the derivative
of x to the third power

00:08:11.501 --> 00:08:13.299
but instead of an x, I have a cosine of x

00:08:13.299 --> 00:08:14.969
so instead of it being three x squared,

00:08:14.969 --> 00:08:18.281
it is three cosine of x squared

00:08:18.281 --> 00:08:19.540
and then the chain rule says,

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:20.690
if we want to get finally get

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:21.792
the derivative with respect to x,

00:08:21.792 --> 00:08:24.037
we then take the derivative of cosine of x

00:08:24.037 --> 00:08:25.800
with respect to x.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.223
I know that's a big mouthful
but we are at the homestretch.

00:08:29.223 --> 00:08:31.593
We've now figured out the derivative.

00:08:31.593 --> 00:08:34.010
It's going to be this times this.

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:36.781
So let's see, that's going
to be negative three,

00:08:36.781 --> 00:08:39.281
negative three times sine of x

00:08:40.711 --> 00:08:42.794
times cosine squared of x

00:08:45.735 --> 00:08:47.938
and I know that was kind
of a long way of saying it.

00:08:47.938 --> 00:08:50.348
I'm trying to explain the
chain rule at the same time.

00:08:50.348 --> 00:08:52.143
But once you get the hang of
it, you're just going to say,

00:08:52.143 --> 00:08:56.170
alright, well, let me take
the derivative of the outside

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:59.472
of something to the third power
with respect to the inside.

00:08:59.472 --> 00:09:02.488
Let me just treat that cosine
of x like as if it was an x.

00:09:02.488 --> 00:09:03.349
Well, that's going to be,

00:09:03.349 --> 00:09:06.819
if I do that, that's going to
be three cosine squared of x

00:09:06.819 --> 00:09:08.815
so that's that part and that part

00:09:08.815 --> 00:09:11.467
and then let me take the
derivative of the inside

00:09:11.467 --> 00:09:12.539
with respect to x.

00:09:12.539 --> 00:09:15.289
Well, that is negative sine of x.
