00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:26.510
where what I was getting out of people's
in this one and she couldn't see the

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:26.520
in this one and she couldn't see the
 

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.660
in this one and she couldn't see the
compromise that okay if they call it

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:29.670
compromise that okay if they call it
 

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.130
compromise that okay if they call it
something else they believe it something

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:31.140
something else they believe it something
 

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.290
something else they believe it something
else and it does kind of seem like an

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:33.300
else and it does kind of seem like an
 

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.500
else and it does kind of seem like an
extreme for what we know I mean I don't

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:36.510
extreme for what we know I mean I don't
 

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:37.790
extreme for what we know I mean I don't
know how this world works maybe there is

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:37.800
know how this world works maybe there is
 

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.090
know how this world works maybe there is
magic oh it's a strange enough world you

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:41.100
magic oh it's a strange enough world you
 

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.710
magic oh it's a strange enough world you
know but for me there is a scientific

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:42.720
know but for me there is a scientific
 

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.510
know but for me there is a scientific
reasoning for it too you know now reason

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:44.520
reasoning for it too you know now reason
 

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.630
reasoning for it too you know now reason
for everything so um but yeah it's sort

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:47.640
for everything so um but yeah it's sort
 

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.570
for everything so um but yeah it's sort
of these you know two extremes colliding

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:50.580
of these you know two extremes colliding
 

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:54.380
of these you know two extremes colliding
uh and I thought the only thing I don't

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:54.390
uh and I thought the only thing I don't
 

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:55.520
uh and I thought the only thing I don't
know about is the end because I would

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:55.530
know about is the end because I would
 

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:57.410
know about is the end because I would
have liked her maybe it would have been

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:57.420
have liked her maybe it would have been
 

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.730
have liked her maybe it would have been
too obvious I don't know I would have

00:07:58.730 --> 00:07:58.740
too obvious I don't know I would have
 

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.260
too obvious I don't know I would have
liked a little bit more if maybe she

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:00.270
liked a little bit more if maybe she
 

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:03.020
liked a little bit more if maybe she
came to a compromise cuz the cold spell

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:03.030
came to a compromise cuz the cold spell
 

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:04.730
came to a compromise cuz the cold spell
happened she goes wow like she didn't

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:04.740
happened she goes wow like she didn't
 

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:07.340
happened she goes wow like she didn't
expect that and then she just kind of

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:07.350
expect that and then she just kind of
 

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:10.010
expect that and then she just kind of
goes back and uses you know science like

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:10.020
goes back and uses you know science like
 

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:12.950
goes back and uses you know science like
nothing that much came of it which oh no

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:12.960
nothing that much came of it which oh no
 

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.840
nothing that much came of it which oh no
it's not like she can't use science or

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:14.850
it's not like she can't use science or
 

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:17.660
it's not like she can't use science or
anything you know but there's I was

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:17.670
anything you know but there's I was
 

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:18.680
anything you know but there's I was
trying to figure out whether or not she

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:18.690
trying to figure out whether or not she
 

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:20.240
trying to figure out whether or not she
actually learned anything out of this or

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:20.250
actually learned anything out of this or
 

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:22.250
actually learned anything out of this or
that was even the point whether or not

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:22.260

stuff but neither side is bending to

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:04.440
stuff but neither side is bending to

each other yeah that was sort of VAS or

00:10:07.699 --> 00:10:07.709
each other yeah that was sort of VAS or
 

00:10:07.709 --> 00:10:10.250
each other yeah that was sort of VAS or
my thing at the end to it and maybe

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:10.260
my thing at the end to it and maybe
 

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.019
my thing at the end to it and maybe
that's the point maybe it's just like

00:10:12.019 --> 00:10:12.029
that's the point maybe it's just like
 

00:10:12.029 --> 00:10:14.750
that's the point maybe it's just like
nobody will her learn anything from this

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:44.100
like they may have asked a question but
 

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:46.130
like they may have asked a question but
they never answered it they kind of like

00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:46.140
they never answered it they kind of like
 

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:48.050

stopped they they were going towards an

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:48.060
stopped they they were going towards an
 

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:50.150
stopped they they were going towards an
answer like an answer or like a

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:50.160
answer like an answer or like a
 

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:53.480
answer like an answer or like a
compromise even and then it just kind of

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:53.490
compromise even and then it just kind of
 

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:55.700
compromise even and then it just kind of
stopped I don't think you you don't

what I would have liked would have been

00:22:58.460 --> 00:22:58.470
what I would have liked would have been
 

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:01.090
what I would have liked would have been
maybe a burka Daniel doing the whole

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:01.100
maybe a burka Daniel doing the whole
 

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:04.040
maybe a burka Daniel doing the whole
doing the magic and at the same time for

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:04.050
doing the magic and at the same time for
 

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:05.720
doing the magic and at the same time for
poking and he would not notice it

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:05.730
poking and he would not notice it
 

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:07.910
poking and he would not notice it
exactly that's why okay there's that the

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:07.920
exactly that's why okay there's that the
 

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:09.950
exactly that's why okay there's that the
science and magic are working together

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:09.960
science and magic are working together
 

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:13.460
science and magic are working together
to heal someone and all about okay but

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:13.470
to heal someone and all about okay but
 

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:15.440
to heal someone and all about okay but
they couldn't even do that it's like no

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:15.450
they couldn't even do that it's like no
 

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:16.790
they couldn't even do that it's like no
we're just gonna leave it kind of

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:16.800
we're just gonna leave it kind of
 

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.470
we're just gonna leave it kind of
open-ended and that deal with it the

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480
open-ended and that deal with it the
 

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.330
open-ended and that deal with it the
only thing I can think is maybe they

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:20.340
only thing I can think is maybe they
 

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:22.520
only thing I can think is maybe they
were doing that think thinking that we

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:22.530
were doing that think thinking that we
 

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:23.510
were doing that think thinking that we
knew they were gonna go that direction

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520
knew they were gonna go that direction
 

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.330
knew they were gonna go that direction
and then they yanked us out like no no

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:26.340
and then they yanked us out like no no
 

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:27.890
and then they yanked us out like no no
he knows and it's just a cop-out you

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:27.900
he knows and it's just a cop-out you
 

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:30.170
he knows and it's just a cop-out you
know like maybe the cop-out is the joke

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:30.180
know like maybe the cop-out is the joke
 

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.690
know like maybe the cop-out is the joke
I don't know why but yeah I felt like

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:32.700
I don't know why but yeah I felt like
 

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:35.150
I don't know why but yeah I felt like
the focuser here but I I'm with you if

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:35.160
the focuser here but I I'm with you if
 

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.740
the focuser here but I I'm with you if
they leave it open-ended like you're not

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:36.750
they leave it open-ended like you're not
 

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:39.290
they leave it open-ended like you're not
supposed to know that's fine I don't

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:39.300
supposed to know that's fine I don't
 

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:41.120
supposed to know that's fine I don't
feel that's what they were focusing on

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:41.130
feel that's what they were focusing on
 

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:43.970
feel that's what they were focusing on
at least at the end that the rest of the

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:43.980
at least at the end that the rest of the
 

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.230
at least at the end that the rest of the
time I can definitely see it because

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:45.240
time I can definitely see it because
 

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:48.260
time I can definitely see it because
there are two extremes yeah but yeah I

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:48.270
there are two extremes yeah but yeah I
 

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:50.060
there are two extremes yeah but yeah I
didn't get so much out of the end but

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:50.070
didn't get so much out of the end but
 

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:52.340
didn't get so much out of the end but
but you say you did you yeah I got kind

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:52.350
but you say you did you yeah I got kind
 

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:53.420
but you say you did you yeah I got kind
of you know they're doing the whole the

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:53.430
of you know they're doing the whole the
 

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:54.650
of you know they're doing the whole the
magics there they're making it feel

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:54.660
magics there they're making it feel
 

00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:56.750
magics there they're making it feel
better and then they have you know the

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:56.760
better and then they have you know the
 

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:59.000
better and then they have you know the
the science doesn't the cure in you they

00:23:59.000 --> 00:23:59.010
the science doesn't the cure in you they
 

00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:00.740
the science doesn't the cure in you they
don't really go into you know because

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:00.750
don't really go into you know because
 

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:02.270
don't really go into you know because
that's the over you know has been a

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:02.280
that's the over you know has been a
 

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.880
that's the over you know has been a
venture time has very abrupt endings you

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:04.890
venture time has very abrupt endings you
 

00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:06.080
venture time has very abrupt endings you
know there isn't really much time to

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:06.090
know there isn't really much time to
 

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:07.400
know there isn't really much time to
explain you know they're both doing it

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:07.410
explain you know they're both doing it
 

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:09.080
explain you know they're both doing it
and then maybe not the same you know

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:09.090
and then maybe not the same you know
 

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:11.810
and then maybe not the same you know
