00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.720
I have a question about leadership.

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.970
I'm a firefighter and some of the guys on my department have been pushing me to

3
00:00:06.971 --> 00:00:07.804
step up

4
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.950
and put in for an opera officer's position and I'm honored but won't wear one.

5
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.200
When we were going to a call,

6
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.410
I was presented with an opportunity to lead and passed it up.

7
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.480
I didn't know what I was thinking.
I can't believe I did that.

8
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.250
Did I just lose credibility if I did?
Is there

9
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.980
Oh,
was to get back that back away,
right?
That's what he meant.
If I did,

10
00:00:34.981 --> 00:00:35.970
is there a way to get that back?

11
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.350
<v 2>Thanks.
Okay,
so first of all,
this is just a general rule.</v>

12
00:00:40.351 --> 00:00:42.990
If you want to lead,
always be ready to lead,
right?

13
00:00:42.991 --> 00:00:47.940
Be ready to step up and make sure you're not stepping on people's toes as
always,

14
00:00:47.941 --> 00:00:51.510
but be ready to lead.
And the way you do that,
as you think about you,

15
00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:54.090
what do you do in certain situations,
you should always be thinking about that.

16
00:00:54.091 --> 00:00:55.380
You should be thinking,

17
00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.060
even if you're a trooper or a follower in a certain situation,
you should think,

18
00:01:00.061 --> 00:01:03.930
okay,
well how would I lead?
What would I do right now?
What moves would I make?

19
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.230
What would I do if a contingency happened right now?

20
00:01:07.231 --> 00:01:10.320
And what are the possible condenses that I could be looking at?
What are they?

21
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.800
And if you're thinking that as well as a

22
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.110
frontline guy,

23
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.550
when the opportunity pops up and just jump on it and boom,
there you go.

24
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.980
Then when it does happen,

25
00:01:23.981 --> 00:01:28.810
of course you gotta stay detached because you want to make sure that you don't

26
00:01:28.811 --> 00:01:32.890
lead too far.
You don't overstep your bounds and step on toes.

27
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:33.880
You've got to be careful of that.

28
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.540
So you need to live with that mindset and that will make you such a,

29
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.360
a better leader when the moment does come,
if you're always thinking about,

30
00:01:43.361 --> 00:01:46.090
if you're always watching,
like you talked about earlier,
I'm watching the leader,

31
00:01:46.091 --> 00:01:48.160
I'm seeing what they're doing,
I'm seeing what I might do differently.

32
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.710
I'm still supporting them.
I'm supporting you.
If you're in charge,

33
00:01:50.711 --> 00:01:53.470
I'm supporting you.
But I'm thinking I might,
I might do this.
And then you watch,

34
00:01:53.471 --> 00:01:54.304
what would my,

35
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.460
what would the results of my decision had been compared to what they did?

36
00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.170
So you can be thinking like leader even though you might not necessarily be in a

37
00:02:02.171 --> 00:02:03.310
leadership position.

38
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.680
So live with that mindset.
That's what you need to do.

39
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.210
Now as far as you passing up the opportunity to lead,

40
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.760
which yes,
you're admitting wasn't air.
First of all,

41
00:02:15.761 --> 00:02:20.761
I'll say they say probably it's probably not quite as obvious to everyone else

42
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.520
as it is to you.
In your mind you're thinking,
Oh man,
I blew it.

43
00:02:24.521 --> 00:02:25.354
This was my chance.

44
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.510
And I bet the guys who went back from that call and didn't even think about it,

45
00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.590
didn't even think about it again.
Most likely,
unless it was just some flake,

46
00:02:32.591 --> 00:02:35.800
flagrant,
I don't want to lead.
I really already.
If you did that well then yeah,

47
00:02:35.801 --> 00:02:37.360
people will get us there.
But if you just said,

48
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.690
if you just kind of backed away from a moment and people,

49
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.200
people might have realized it.
But anyways,
regardless of that,

50
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.070
you probably guess what I'm going to say.
Then what you gotta do is own it,
right?

51
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.173
You got to own it.

52
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.900
So when the opportunity presents itself to explain what happened and what went

53
00:02:56.411 --> 00:03:00.790
wrong and what you did wrong,
right?
Not Making excuses,

54
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.950
but explain where you were weak,
you know,
so you say,

55
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.290
hey guys,
you know,
hey,

56
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:12.730
remember that last call I should have stepped up and I had the d had the wrong

57
00:03:12.731 --> 00:03:16.720
mindset.
I wasn't ready to lead and I let him,
not only did I let you guys down,

58
00:03:16.721 --> 00:03:20.680
I let myself down and I'm not going to let that happen again.
From now on,

59
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.020
I'm going to have leadership in the front of my mind.

60
00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:23.854
That's what I'm going to do.

61
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.760
I'm going to be thinking about what needs to get done.

62
00:03:26.761 --> 00:03:30.790
I'm gonna be thinking about contingencies and how I'm going to lead and I

63
00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:34.030
promise the next time this opportunity comes up,
I'm going to be ready to lead.

64
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.380
So I'm sorry for letting you guys down and won't happen again.
Okay,

65
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.620
that's,
that's it.
Boom.

66
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.260
Get the mindset live and think as a leader,

67
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.160
regardless of what position you're actually in,

68
00:03:51.161 --> 00:03:54.820
and then when they call you in the opera,
tunity presents itself.

69
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.740
Step up and lead.

70
00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.930
Obviously that's your default mindset now.

71
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.660
Yes.
It seems obvious to me.

72
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.550
It is truly was it always like that?
Like even before,

73
00:04:09.551 --> 00:04:13.000
it's that story that I've told over and over again about being on an oil rig and

74
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:16.980
coming up and guys not knowing where to go or everyone freezing and,

75
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.890
and me going,
okay,
let me just to step back and look around and make a call.

76
00:04:20.891 --> 00:04:22.060
And when I did that,
that was it.

77
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.980
And so I clicked it clicked or I would say,

78
00:04:26.981 --> 00:04:29.620
I guess I was thinking about it beforehand because I was,
you know,

79
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.320
observing my leaders and thinking about what they were doing and what I would do

80
00:04:32.321 --> 00:04:34.300
differently in a certain situation.
Yeah.

81
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.380
<v 0>Yeah.
That's crazy.
Cause even in everyday life,</v>

82
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.590
which is what I represent everyday life,
but you know how your life or girl,

83
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.560
whatever is like,
Hey,
well you know,
what's the dinner situation?

84
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.790
What do you want?
Oh I don't care.
Whenever you want.
You know,

85
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.530
that's a time where I,
I always feel this,
what this guy just asked,
you know,

86
00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.260
I mean obviously it's nothing compared to his situation,
but they're like,
hey,

87
00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:04.570
well,
you know,
what do you thinking for dinner kind of thing.
And I'm like,
Hey,

88
00:05:04.571 --> 00:05:06.820
I don't,
I don't care.
And that's really how I feel.
I don't care.

89
00:05:06.821 --> 00:05:09.940
I'm done kind of down for whatever kind of thing.
But that's not why,

90
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.750
that's not why she's asking me.
She wants me,

91
00:05:13.751 --> 00:05:16.960
she wants me to make the decision mean and take to step up and lead,

92
00:05:16.961 --> 00:05:18.970
step up and be like,
this is what we're having for dinner.

93
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.430
I'm going to go get her,
I'm going to make it or whatever.
That's what she wants.

94
00:05:21.431 --> 00:05:24.610
And really those little dots,
those,
that situation comes up all the time.

95
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.780
Like you know the old that the Joe actually that's kind of like a joke.
You know,

96
00:05:28.781 --> 00:05:31.930
when you ask the grill when a girl says,
or when you ask go,
Hey,

97
00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:34.030
what do you want to eat?
And she says,
I don't,
I don't care.
Whatever.

98
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.950
And then you say,
okay,
we're going to go eat here.
And said,
hey,

99
00:05:35.951 --> 00:05:39.850
I don't really like that.
See?
Yeah,
it's you gotta yeah,

100
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.080
I feel like this guy when I do that though,
that's the point there from now on,

101
00:05:44.081 --> 00:05:45.790
you're going to step up and I'm going to do it yet,

102
00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.830
but I want it to be my default is why,

103
00:05:47.831 --> 00:05:49.680
you know like yours is like your default laying into,

104
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.760
oh this is what we're doing.
There you go.
Okay.
You know what?

105
00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.040
I wish that was true with her when it did come to dinner.

106
00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.390
<v 2>Actually no,
it kind of is true cause I only to like three places to eat.
Yes.</v>

107
00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.500
And I go to one 80% of the time.
Yeah.

108
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.370
So the other 20% of the time,
so she says where you want to go?

109
00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:10.920
I'm going to say that my restaurant.
Yeah,
we're going to Ragland's in ob.

110
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.310
That makes it harder though.
Right?
Does she like Ragman stuff?
She does.
She does.

111
00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.770
Easier.
Easier.
Yeah.

112
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.280
But and if she doesn't feel like it then she'll be like,

113
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.600
I don't really want to go there.
Okay,
cool.
Now it's on you.
I gave you my vote.

114
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.680
No,
you don't want to do that,
but I think you've still got to do it.

115
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.020
You still gotta make the decision you got to like,

116
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:37.130
cause in a way I'm in the same boat as your second scenario there.

117
00:06:37.131 --> 00:06:38.120
Like if she's not in the room,

118
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.140
so then I just going to name my secondary restaurant.
Right?
There you go.

119
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.060
Just maybe she'll say yes asked.
Maybe she'll say no.
No.

120
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.880
That gotta be my default now though.
All right.
Step up and lead.

121
00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.220
You know what I,
you know what I've gotta do?
I've got to prepare.

122
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.420
I've got to prepare myself.

123
00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:58.220
I got to have like five options just ready to go on deck.
That's what I have.

124
00:06:58.221 --> 00:07:03.110
Three slope
and they all come in the same order.

125
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:09.050
I must be really boring.
Hey,
you focus on what's important.
That's good.

126
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.190
Whenever my wife says,
you know,
well,
don't you ever want to try anything new?

127
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.910
I said,
nope.
Yeah,
I don't.
I don't.
Yeah.
Speaking of which,
Darling,

128
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.590
you're my girl.
I'm not looking to try anything new.

129
00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:24.020
That might happen with having the same thing there.
You happy?
Yes.

130
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.040
That's actually that I'm going to use that light right there,

131
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:31.580
but what do you do when the team wants to try something new?
All right,

132
00:07:31.581 --> 00:07:35.780
let's rock and roll.
Let's do that.
All right.
Good tips.
