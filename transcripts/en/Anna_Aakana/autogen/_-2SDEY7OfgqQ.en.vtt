00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.700
 I have been troubled by my belief for many years. I have been influenced by Christianity since I was a child. 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.880
 Dear God, please bless me in the lottery so that I can control the world. 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.900
 Then adopt all the cats. Ok, thank you, goodbye! 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.740
 But after my sister committed suicide at the age of 17, I became an atheist. 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:22.000
 Dear God, why are you doing this? You are a jerk, I will leave you now. Goodbye! 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.280
 Then I came into contact with Buddhism. 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.600
 Buddha, the Eight Holy Path sounds too dazzling, good, dude. 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.060
 Finally, I decided to be an agnostic. 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.340
 Dear alien, or FBI, or my brother, or anyone who is listening to me, 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.800
 If there is a kind of deep power that I can't understand, it is like a small ant can't understand 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.660
 Individual employment tax rate on annual statements. Then 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.340
 I am very willing to recognize my ignorance. 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.100
 From my efficacious point of view, the generation of the same age as me seems to be less concerned about the practice of doing so. 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.480
 We don't want to understand at all. We are not encouraged to meditate. 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.820
 But when we tried to do it, we discovered that God, it is super difficult. 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.620
 what! so boring! I am very busy! 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.320
 And I don't really like to organize religious activities. I do not know 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.180
 How can there be a universal law that applies to everyone? Or when we didn’t even figure out the atomic science 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.220
 It can explain where people will go after death. 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.160
 The result came out. We finally found out that we didn’t know anything. 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.000
 [Super Excited] 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.640
 In fact, this new study denies what we know. 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.100
 Everything! 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.160
 [Super Excited] 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.680
 We are scientists! 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.620
 Should I believe in God? If so, which god should I believe? 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.640
 Should you believe in God in Western tradition? 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.860
 The one who sat in heaven and could do everything 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.460
 The one who has been watching my actions? Maybe because he subscribed to me? 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.400
 Dear God, please bless me in the lottery so that I can control the world and adopt all the cats. 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.300
 How does she know her fate? 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.760
 Where is the erase memory key pressed? 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.060
 what! No electricity, you have to change the battery. 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.260
 I really want to believe that there is such a god who has been caring for protecting me. 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.900
 Protect everyone. 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.660
 But once I think about the terrible things that happen in the world, 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.960
 I really can't believe that there is such a god. 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.880
 Is there really an unknown force in the world that guides the world? 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.580
 Or connect everyone? Is there in the middle? 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.540
 The transmission of energy? 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.220
 Really, I really want to believe that there is that kind of thing. But don't misunderstand me, 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.420
 They are all different. 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.420
 If you resonate with a religion and make you want to be a better person 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.960
 Then don’t even think about it. I mean, people should follow their own wishes. 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.340
 A summary of your life experience can find a kind of 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.340
 unbreakable faith. 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.200
 You see, my faith is in my different stages of life. 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.080
 Constantly changing and developing. And I don't reject this change. 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.940
 What do you think? I feel sorry after I ask the question. 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.100
 Or pass this video will make me regret, can I face all kinds of doubts? 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.640
 Please tell me. I am Anna Akana, I wish you all happy, see you next time! 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.080

 Little trees 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.260
 I’m listening to ROOM’s book recently, 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.320
