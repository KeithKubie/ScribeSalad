00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The answer is 0.99998. There are 2 ways to solve this.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
One is to sum these two. Not too hard to do.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The other way to solve it is to use the complementary event property,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
which makes the math a little easier in this case.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
That property is that we know the sum of all possible events has to be 1.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Instead of computing P valid by adding the probabilities of heads and tails,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
we can compute it by subtracking from 1 the probability of events not invalid,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
which is the probability of E, which is 0.00002.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
That would get us the same answer.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The property that we're using to do this is the complementary even property.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
What it states is that for any event A, the probability of that event

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and the probability of the complement of that event--

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
that is of that not happening--is equal to 1.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
What not-A here means is that elements in the universe minus the elements in A.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
This is set subtraction. We can think of that like this.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
This is our universe if we have some event A all outcomes that are not part of a

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
must be the complement of A.

00:01:17.000 --> 99:59:59.000
That's what you get by removing A from the probability set.
