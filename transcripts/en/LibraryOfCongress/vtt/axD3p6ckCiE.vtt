00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.160
Thank you.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.390
It's a pleasure to be
here with you today

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.750
to celebrate books and
the joy of reading.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.710
I'm Gig Dixon, Senior Vice
President and Director

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.300
of Strategic Partnerships
for Wells Fargo.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.050
Wells Fargo is a proud, very
proud sponsor and we're proud

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.840
to have been here for six
years as a charter sponsor

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.540
of the National Book Festival.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.500
As in years past, we have fun
exhibits for you to experience.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.910
So if you haven't been there yet,

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.030
please make your way
to the exhibits.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.180
Please be sure to check out
our Let's Read America Pavilion

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.320
where we're featuring hands-on
history offering the opportunity

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.660
to pan for gold and, yes, lasso
a pony as well as the chance

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.590
to tell your personal story
in the My Untold exhibit

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.530
and the opportunity to climb
into a Wells Fargo stage coach.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.290
Wells Fargo is committed to making
a real difference in education

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.210 position:56%
by maintaining an active involvement
in our public education system,

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.280
arguably the most important
institution in our country.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.020
We believe financial success begins
with a foundation of strong reading

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.000
and math skills in early education.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.560
Jackie Kennedy, a former
first lady said it will.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.060
There are many little ways to
enlarge your child's world,

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.910
love of books is best of all.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.340
It is now my pleasure to
introduce to you Marcia Davis,

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.640
Editor of the Washington
Post Magazine.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.510
Thank you.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.870
[ Applause ]

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.420 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: So welcome everyone

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.440
to this wonderful afternoon
with Margo Jefferson.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.240
Let me start by saying I'm not
the editor of the magazine,

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.150
but I am an articles editor
of the magazine, one of three.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.080
And I'm very happy to be here.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.570
No, no, that's fine.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.430
People do that all the time.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.080
And I'm just so excited to
be here for many reasons

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.430
and we have a very joyous afternoon
because today is the opening day

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.510
of the National Museum of African
American History and Culture.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.730
[ Applause ]

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.780
And that day is made
far more bountiful

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.620
by spending the afternoon
with Ms. Jefferson.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.920
Oh, you can't?

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.220
I thought--

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.800
&gt;&gt; Your mic is turned on?

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.100
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: Hello.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.400
Can you hear me now?

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.190
I feel like the Verizon
guy whose like switched

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.740
to Sprint or something right now.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:00.600
So Ms. Jefferson is
the wonderful author

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.950
of the 2015 memoir "Negroland".

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:17.490 position:56%
And she is also a former arts critic
for the New York Times and Newsweek

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.760
and is also now the
writing instructor

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.110
at Columbia University
School of the Arts.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.740
She is, you may know also, a
Pulitzer Prize winning author

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:33.250
for her criticism and you
may also know the author

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.480
of a very interesting piece
of work about Michael Jackson

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.720
who in my pre-teen years was my
adorable handsome fantasy man.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.210
He was singing to me, only
me when he was crooning.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:54.510
So we're very happy to be here
and to welcome Margo Jefferson.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.330
[ Applause ]

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.270 position:56%
So the way this will work is we
will talk for about 25 minutes or so

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.040
and then there'll be
time for the audience

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.220
to jump in and to ask questions.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.520
And why don't we just start.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.430
I'd like to start by
talking about the Museum

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.780
of African American
History and Culture.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.510
I know you haven't seen it.

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:17.810
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson:
From the outside.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.310
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: Except
from the outside.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.540
But what is that-- do you think

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.760
that this museum will make a
difference in this country?

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.060
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: Oh, sure.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.360
Can you all hear me?

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.660
&gt;&gt; [Simultaneously] No.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.960
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: No.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.260
All right.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.560
You know, it's easy that
my microphone isn't on.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:40.390
Let's see.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.640
I do not know what to do here.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.940
Ah! Wait a minute.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.280
Power on now can-- ah.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.700
Bliss, all right.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.660
Bliss wasn't in that
dawn to be alive.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:54.960
All right.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:01.990
It's-- This represents and
entirely new stage platform world

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.460
for African American history.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.530
There are so many stages.

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:13.830
They just, in my life, I believe
through my parents who are born

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.770
in the early 20th century,
1908 and 1916.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.520
They were of the generation of
the association for the study

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.570
of Negro life and history.

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:30.120
Founded by Carter G. Woodson,
it was very meticulous

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.340
and scrupulous groundbreaking
history.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.480
W. E. B. Du Bois was part of it.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.010
It was segregated history.

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:44.560
Meaning, very few people other than
black scholars and blacks wanting

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.910 position:56%
to be educated really knew about it.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.230
It mirrored in that way
a segregated nation.

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:57.270
When I came along in the-- I
was born at the end of '40s.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.280
I went to a quite progressive
school, which was largely white.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:06.120
So we got little bits of
black or even African history,

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.200
but basically tiny
little injections.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.240
I was getting basically,
you know, canonical history.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.670
And my parents at a certain
point began to worry that I

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:22.300
in fact needed remedial
black history lessons.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.560
You know, because in
an integrated world,

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.460
I wasn't getting the
history they had gotten

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.510
in grammar school, et cetera.

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:36.320
College was era-- I was in
college in the mid and late '60s

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:41.350
of black studies and ethnic
studies, African American studies.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:48.230
You know, and now, you know still
they were controversial, you know,

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.570
these programs have to work
to establish themselves.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:58.920
Now to see this kind of given,
the acceptance, the claiming of it

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.570
and the entitlement, you know,

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:03.870
that this is a major,
this is not footnote.

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:09.210
This is not special interest as
conservatist often like to say

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:12.940
about minorities and
women, special interest.

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.840
You know, this is major American
history in Washington, DC.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.330
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: Thank you.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:20.630
Thank you.

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:24.300
Your book won the National Books--

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:28.270
the National Book Critic
Circles Award for autobiography.

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:33.030
And you titled it "Negroland"
and that is an interesting title

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:37.330
and it almost seems as another
country inside a country.

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:38.840
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: Exactly.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.590
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: And I wonder if
you could talk a little bit more

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:42.700
about how you came to
name the book that.

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:44.000
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: Gladly.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.730
And you said it exactly right.

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:50.780
I wanted that sense of
another country, James Weldon,

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:55.840
within a country, a separate
and yet overlapping land.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.040
I chose the word Negro

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:02.570
because capitalized it was the
honored and preferred term.

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:07.590
As I'm sure people of an older
generation in this audience know.

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:15.240
For basically early 20th
century to mid to late '60s,

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:19.650
the Harlem Renaissance
talked about the New Negro.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:22.750
The New York Times
began capitalizing it.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:25.020
This was a big fight in the '30s.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:30.770
But that was the honored word
during my coming of the age years

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:34.160
and I wanted to use that as a way

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:42.350
of helping recreate the
culture of being a Negro.

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:47.750
And in the world I was in,
which was the Negro bourgeoisie

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:51.760
which called itself-- like to call
itself an upper class or an elite,

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.270
you know, being a Negro meant--

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:58.020 position:56%
it's what people call
respectability politics today trying

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:03.770
to be a perfect emblematic--
emblematically intelligent,

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:05.850
dignified, representative
of your race.

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:08.980
And this went, you
know, into everything

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:12.400
from your speech patterns,
to your manners, to, in fact,

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:19.450
in my Chicago version of that
world, having decent race politics,

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:21.640
you know, advancing the race.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:26.240
So all I wanted to capture
those rituals that tone.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:31.750
Land is an interesting word because
lands have their own culture,

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:36.420
each land, which we did
as American Negroes.

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:41.710
But lands are also bordered by
others, sometimes hostile lands.

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:44.060
And, you know, the
very segregated world

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:50.630
of Chicago contained various kinds
of black life all bordering on

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:56.830
and often menaced by
white lands, if you will.

00:09:56.830 --> 00:10:01.150
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: So what--
I'm curious as a writer.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:05.940
When you-- When is it that you
decided to write this memoir?

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:10.000
And how long were you writing it
before you actually committed words

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.300
to paper?

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.030
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: Oh,
that's a good question.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:15.170
You are an editor, aren't you?

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:16.880
All right.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.380 position:56%
So your first one is when did began?

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:21.680
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: Decide.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:22.980
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson:
Decide, all right.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.820
You know, often when
you're a writer, you know,

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:26.370
you're going about your business

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:28.330
like some people you're
turning out books.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.910
I was turning out articles.

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:34.570
But, you know, material
keeps building up.

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:39.490
And as particularly my parents
got older and as I, you know,

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:44.430 position:56%
got through my rebellions and began
to trust myself in relation to them,

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:48.690
every time I visited Chicago,
their world became more

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:53.370
and more interesting to me because
I could bring an adult person

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:57.670
and writer's eye to it
and look back at all--

00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:02.250
look at all the rituals and
manners and ways and expressions.

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:07.430 position:56%
They were carrying on, you know,
and realized, "Oh, my God, you know.

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:09.110
This has to be preserved.

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:11.360
This is fascinating."

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:15.380
And Isabel Wilkerson captures
that, you know, all that so well

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.760
in her book "The Warmth
of Other Suns",

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:22.740
so many ways of talking,
thinking, dressing.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:24.740
So that's I think when it started--

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:29.800
probably I started taking notes in
the '70s or '80s but did not at all

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.850
yet commit myself,
commit my imagination

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:36.060
or my consciousness to a book.

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:42.020
In-- Not until the 2000s really
did I decide I have to do this.

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:45.460
Zoey Mil Harrison [assumed
spelling] has a great line about--

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:48.240
she's talking about needing
to tell a story as a writer

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:54.200
and she says there's the Roman
legend of the boy who that was

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:59.780
like a wolf knowing at his entrails
and that's what happens when story

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:01.580
for a writer can't come out.

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:05.510
So I started to feel acutely
uncomfortable and I would get angry

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:11.550
and jealous when other writers
were turning out memoirs or novels

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:14.390
that I thought they're
expressing something.

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:20.310
I'm not. And then frankly, in
2008, I got a grant for it.

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:23.180
And then my sister who was
three years older than I

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.560
and the director of
the Alvanley School.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:30.800
My sister got cancer and I thought
I have to-- you know, I have--

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.800
often life gives you
a kind of urgency.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.880
I thought I have to record
everything I can while she's alive

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:42.270 position:56%
but also, you know, because I don't
know how long any of them will live.

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:43.570
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: Right.

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:44.870
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: Yeah.

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.170
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: What-- So was she
able to see any part of your book?

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:48.440
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: She saw part of
it, yes, she didn't see the whole

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.180
and she helped a lot, you know.

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:53.680
Siblings, relatives, you have
different kinds of memory

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:59.020
and she had very acute sense memory
and also just things to compare--

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:00.320
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: Right.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.620
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: -- against.

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:02.920
So that was good.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.220
And my mother-- my
father died first.

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:07.380
My mother is incredibly sharp
and witty and I was constantly--

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:13.210
I'd be on the phone with her and
I'd be typing down her witticisms.

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:14.510
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: Right, right.

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:22.090
So when we-- you know, you've
taken us into this second country

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:26.910
in our country of the black
elite, the black bourgeoisie.

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:32.220
And the geography, the map you draw
the geography is very intimate,

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:37.180
very detailed, and
also very painful.

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:41.030
And I wondered if you could
talk a little bit about that

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:43.380
and how you feel about it now?

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:49.220 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: Well, you know,
to this business of belonging to the

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:54.100
so called elite of an--

00:13:54.100 --> 00:14:00.200
discriminated against to
oppressed group is very peculiar.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:04.450
You certainly-- you're
a fool and you're a liar

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:07.970
if you do not acknowledge
that you are sheltered

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:11.620
and privileged in many ways.

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:14.940
Where I think the pain
and the-- came is--

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:23.290
you know, it's partly the old W.
E. B. Du Bois double consciousness.

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:28.400
We were constantly living
out and living up to all

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:32.960
of the accomplishments
and achievements

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.240
of black people, of Negroes.

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.780
And that's where we did know
or were taught black history.

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:44.020
At the same time we knew perfectly
well that if we did not proved

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:46.470
in terms of manners,
our accomplishments,

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:51.700
our cultural references that we
were as good as a white people,

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:56.830
which in a clear way meant
being like white people,

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:58.640
then we were flapping, you know.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.820
That leads both

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:05.740
to self consciousness a
struggle with self hatred.

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:07.040
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: Yeah.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.340
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: And
that was very difficult.

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:14.350 position:56%
Also there was kind of self scrutiny
particularly for girls, I would say.

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:18.170
You know, this constant
surveillance and watching

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:21.040
of are my manners good enough?

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.360
Am I a lady?

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:26.030
We were-- As girls
were busy combating.

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:30.080
We had been taught the history
of a black women which included--

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.560
you know, we've been raped.

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.930
Many white people think
we weren't even raped.

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:37.490
We were just loose and flatteringly

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:39.910
on the plantations
and after, you know.

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:41.280
We don't really have minds.

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.380
We're just lusty, sexy creatures.

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:49.980
All of those stereotypes, we're
still circulating in the, you know,

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:52.740
through the whole-- through
most of the 20th century.

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:55.390
They only started changing
in the late '60s.

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:59.180
So, you know, that--
those kinds of history--

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:04.230
histories are hanging over you when
you go out to eat in a restaurant,

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:05.880
when you sit down in a
school room, you know.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:12.510 position:56%
When-- Anytime you enter any part of
the white world, at the same time,

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:21.620 position:56%
you know, we were fighting that
self hatred by honoring black people

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:26.350
and their history and yet
because of class prejudice,

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:29.850
you are also cultivating
real kinds of snobbery

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:33.510
as every bourgeoisie
is taught to do.

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:36.170
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: Except the
dress really nice for you today.

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:38.330
[ Laughter ]

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:40.500
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: Oh, God.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.020
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: Just teasing.

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:43.690
Actually I do--

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:47.110
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: And you
look very fabulous in deed.

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:48.410
Yes.

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:49.710
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: Go on.

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:51.010
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson:
You are so [inaudible].

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:54.280
So it's that kind of
self consciousness,

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:58.850
the struggle between pride and
self hatred and the struggle

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:07.080
between honor and snobbery,
I would say, right, it's key.

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:09.360
And consciousness, you know.

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:14.050
Black power was a big struggle for
the black-- for the Negro elite.

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:15.350
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: Right.

00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:16.650
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: Not so
much from my generation.

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:19.040
We were thrilled to seize it.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:25.530
But nevertheless, it felt like you
had to remake yourself entirely.

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:30.730 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: All the internal
scrutiny, I wonder about what it was

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:33.200
like as a child, one of the things

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:40.860 position:56%
that I found rather sad is the
pressure for children to figure this

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:42.630
out and to navigate the world

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:44.870
of through this two
worlds in which they live.

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:46.170
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: Yeah.

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:47.550
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: It seemed very
challenging and also the struggle

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:51.060
for parents, for African
American parents the whole idea

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:54.400
of preserving innocence
as long as you can.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.810 position:56%
I wonder if you can talk about that.

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:57.110
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: There is.

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:58.410
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: And
comparing it now,

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:01.450
do you still see the
remnants of that?

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:02.750
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson:
You know, every--

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:05.270
I'm wondering if I
can find this passage

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:09.950
from the wonderful black historian
and writer James Weldon Johnson

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:14.580
where he describes
exactly the pressures.

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:17.200
Well, I don't want to spend huge
amounts of time looking for it

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:21.910
but he says, "For every Negro
parent," and his writing this

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:26.130
in the '30s, "there is this
battle, internal battle

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:33.070
between keeping a child, you know,
innocent enough to feel confident

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:34.870
about moving through the world.

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:37.780
And yet if you are a black child,

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:41.440
making sure you know
enough about prejudice."

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:45.300
We see played out, acted out in--

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:49.400
you know, in terms of the police
brutality cases all the time

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:52.220
when parents say, "What am
I going to tell my son?"

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:53.910
you know, going through this.

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:56.510
Well, there also, you know,
plenty of other things.

00:18:56.510 --> 00:19:00.100
Parents are worrying about
telling a black child.

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:04.700
So you know, that balance is
always, do you tell too little,

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:08.000
do you tell too much,
do you tell it too soon.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.810
And James Weldon Johnson
has a chilling line.

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:15.020
He says, "Either way if
you go too far either way,

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:18.370
it can spell spiritual disaster
for the child," you know,

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:22.690
which is psychologically as
well as sociologically profound.

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:29.400
And every generation of black
parents inherits what their parents

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.820
did or didn't-- and didn't
do with them and then has

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:36.410
to renegotiate it according
to the historical

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:39.710
and sociological circumstances.

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:43.480
I was not-- my sister and
I we were very protected

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.780
in that world in many ways.

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:48.060
We were not physically threatened.

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:51.880
What our parents had
to navigate, you know,

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.550 position:56%
were things like-- it's in the book.

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:56.890
Well, we go to-- we're
on a vacation,

00:19:56.890 --> 00:20:00.050
we go to a hotel in Atlantic City.

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:03.740
They suddenly can't
find the reservations.

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:06.040
My father says, "Dr. Jefferson."

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:09.390
The hotel clerk keeps saying,
"Mr. Jefferson, I can't find it."

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:12.940
Finally, we got shown
to an egregious room.

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:16.360
You know, and my sister
and I still don't get it.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:19.620
My parents, you know, are--
they don't want to tell us

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:22.090
but they are letting us
know we're leaving tomorrow.

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:23.450
It's a prejudice hotel.

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:25.590
The bathtub is dirty.

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:27.940
There are those kinds of things.

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:32.070
Also, we have to navigate
and integration.

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:36.700 position:56%
And by the time especially you get--
you know, do you do play dates?

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:38.060
Now, this is the '50s.

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:42.500
So let's not forget in the
'50s, the Brown versus Board

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:46.070
of Education is just happening.

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:50.840
So, you know, these little worlds
of this or that, private school

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:54.010
or public school, the private
ones were more sheltered.

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:58.490
They were-- Everyone
was feeling their way.

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:00.650
So, yeah, do you do play dates?

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:02.460
When you do, are you reading

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:05.160
that the mothers are really not
comfortable with each other?

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.850
And do you make of that.

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:09.180
When adolescence comes,
the whole question

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:12.180
of interracial dating comes up.

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:14.860
And, you know, the parents--
all parents have to decide,

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:19.010
I don't want my black child
to be hurt or belittled

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:20.520
or exonecized [phonetic].

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:23.870
But the child has-- is going
to be doing and thinking

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:25.400
and experimenting with things.

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:29.440
I, the parent, did not and
they must have room, you know,

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:32.040
to move into the world
as it changes.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:35.720
That is still going on, of course.

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:41.610
You know, life-- well, you know,
it depends on where you are

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:46.460
and how much, you know, money
and access and privilege

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:48.360
in terms schools, neighborhoods.

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:52.650
The black parents were
talking about have, actually.

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:54.500
I can't give one answer
to that question.

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:59.650
But the negotiations, of
course, are still continuing.

00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:00.950
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: You're right.

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:04.260
Your book has been called and
described as brave and revelatory.

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:08.680
And there is-- there
are a couple of moments

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.830
in the book that are very poignant.

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:15.370
The level of stress for you, you
talked about and being in college

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:21.110
and wanting to avoid offensing
program and practicing--

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:23.140
throwing yourself down the
step so that you could--

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:25.040
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: So that I
could say I had a real injury.

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:26.340
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: Yes.

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:34.300
Exactly. But more poignantly
was this idea that you consider,

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:37.240
thought about suicide quite a lot.

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:42.170 position:56%
And I wanted to know how the process

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:44.730
by which you decided
to write about that.

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:46.380
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: All right.

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:52.760
One, you know, suicide
is a very private matter.

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:57.620
But I decided I wanted to write
about it for several reasons.

00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:03.050
The easiest reason to state
first, I think is, and I am--

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:07.150
well, first the statement
then the qualification.

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:11.340
One of the stereotypes,
interestingly enough

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:15.450
that black people contend
with or one of the sets

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:23.090
of expectations is you're supposed
to be too strong to be depressed,

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:27.070
you know, to breakdown, to
be acknowledged any kind

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:30.190
of unhappiness that's
certainly the way many,

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:35.000
many black people are
raised, you know.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.370
Don't give way.

00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:42.560 position:56%
To give way in anyway to acknowledge
defeat, grief, melancholy,

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:46.020
depression, is to give
the white man,

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:48.330
to give white people the victory.

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:52.630
I grew up very much in
that landscape which,

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:54.980
you know, really comes several.

00:23:54.980 --> 00:24:01.010
Certainly, it's totally forms in
the 19th century it precedes that.

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:08.780 position:56%
And I found it enormously burdensome
as I moved into my life as a writer.

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:13.990
I found when I spoke honestly
to black friends of my, again,

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:17.400
particularly women that I
saw it manifested in men

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.420
that they were often
suffering the same--

00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:23.880
from the same thing and
yet the business of therapy

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:27.870
or counseling, that very forbidden.

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:32.160
So, you know, so much of this book
is about what in terms of the--

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:36.530
you know, one's matriculation
into adult, you know, blackness,

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:41.920
you know, what's forbidden,
what's accepted, you know, what--

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:47.030
how do you-- what's allowed, what
room for improvisation is allowed.

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:48.540
You know, what's the relationship

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:52.780
of each black individual
to the group at large.

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:55.900
So that's one reason I wanted
to write openly about it,

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:57.940
to help break that taboo.

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:02.790 position:56%
And I am finding many of my
students, you know, people of color,

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:07.640
Blacks but also Latins,
South and East Asians.

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:12.380
At Columbia are-- they're
writing about this kind of thing

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:14.020
and responding to it also.

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:18.270
It's been a kind of big
cultural social secret.

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:21.860
The other thing is, if
you're writing a memoir,

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:24.720
you do choose what
material to leave out.

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.020
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: Yes.

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:30.980
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: But a real--
But living within the confines of

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:36.100
and negotiating with
depression, which is as much anger

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:40.880
at it is grief had been a very
large part of my adult life

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:45.630
and it was just too much of
a lie, not to write about it.

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:49.130
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: And I see we
have about five more minutes.

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:52.970
So there's a question that
I wanted to really get to.

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:56.080
And it's about the
quote for your mother.

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.810
It's a very strong quote.

00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:01.240 position:56%
And she says very early in the book.

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.960
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: Yeah, my-- This
is also at my-- they just placed.

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:06.800
My mother and my father
are young-- married.

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:12.760
It's 1943, there at Fort
Huachuca, the all black army fort.

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.780
And my mother is writing.

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:16.520
She's pregnant with my sister.

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.140
She's only been married
a couple of years

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:20.920
and she is writing a
dear friend of hers.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.220
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: Yes.

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:24.990
And she writes to her friend in
the closing part of the letter.

00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:28.520
"Sometimes I almost
forget that I am a Negro.

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:31.160
That's something, huh."

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:32.460
Talk about the statement--

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:33.760
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson:
Oh, wait a minute.

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.060
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: -- and
what that means to you?

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:37.940
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: What proceeds
that is that she is saying

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:42.990
to her friend, you know, there's
another of hers is about is engaged

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:46.700
and my mother is saying, please,
you know, give her my best

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:49.430
and tell her I wish her
all the happiness I have.

00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:52.300
In fact, I have so
much happiness now

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:54.620
that sometimes I almost
forget I'm a Negro

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:56.780
and that's something [inaudible].

00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:59.180
I found that letter--
or my mother found it

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:01.470
and showed it to me in the '70s.

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:07.090
And I read it out loud in
our kitchen to my sister

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:09.710
and my then quite young niece.

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:12.560
And we are joy drunk.

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:18.970
It was so poignant my mother
had always been very meticulous

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:24.620
about what in terms of racial--
we could see her anger at times.

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:31.730
But racial grief, you know, that
sense of helplessness at times.

00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:33.250
She was-- no.

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:35.450
We did not see.

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:40.240
So to read this and realize that,
you know, the rest of the letter is

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:44.120
about movies she's seeing and
sorority doing, then clothes

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:50.750
and books and to see suddenly in
that line all of the pressures,

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:55.120
you know, that she had lived with.

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:59.000
She and every other black
person coming of age,

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.320
you know, had lived with.

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:06.010
And yet to see that she was a
full, charming, and lovely person

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:12.840
and had seized all of these things
that you can take for granted

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:17.520
from falling in love
with someone to loving,

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:22.020
seeing the movie "Jane
Eyre", she had claimed those

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:25.560
for herself even though
in some way we

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:28.720
as black people didn't
quite have licensed--

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.020
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: Yeah.

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:31.320
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson:
-- to those pressures.

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:32.620
That's what I see that
sentence is mean, yeah.

00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:33.920
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: Yeah.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:36.120
I read as she had found
a way to be fully human--

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:37.420
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: Yeah.

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:38.720
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: -- in a
world that one of the things

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.940
that racism does is
it denies humanity--

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:42.240
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: Exactly.

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.540
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: -- and
you're total humanity.

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:44.860
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: And
it can force you to feel--

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:46.500
it's a crime never to forget.

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:47.800
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: Yes.

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.100
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: And she
was saying I can do both.

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:51.360
I can remember and forget.

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:52.660
Yeah.

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:53.960
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: So you
mentioned your niece.

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:58.970
How did you help her navigate
this world as she was growing up?

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:01.750
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: Well, I
followed my sister's lead.

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:05.820
Of course, you have to be
careful as [inaudible] her uncle

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:09.300
because I'm sure some of you know.

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:14.710
Again, I think what we both tried
to do, what I was most aware

00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:19.290
of was she wanted to
dance, she was musical,

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:24.250
really encouraging everything in
her temperament and personality

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:28.590
that signaled flourishing, you
know, and to give her a sense.

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:31.350
I always had her keeping
a little notebook.

00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:33.950
Not because she was going to
become a writer necessarily,

00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:39.360 position:56%
but because as a girl also, I wanted
her to feel her thought mattered,

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:43.050
you know, that she could have
observations about anything.

00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:49.190
In terms of race, we try to follow
the James Weldon Johnson lead.

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:52.080
She took ballet lessons very early.

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:56.560
And so my sister really had
to navigate between, you know,

00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:02.350
encouraging the hard work and
the discipline and the pleasure

00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:06.770
that if you love ballet, it can
give you nevertheless and the fact

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:10.080
that it was a very,
very white world.

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:13.480
My niece, oh, eventually danced
with the Frankfort Ballet

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:16.050
and the Dance Theater of Harlem.

00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:17.780
But she's 46 now.

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:21.030
You know, there would not have
been room for her in ballet theater

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:22.620
as there is now for
wonderful [inaudible].

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:23.920
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: Right, yes.

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:25.220
Right, yeah.

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:26.650
Do you think white--

00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:30.290
This is something that my
friends and I debate so often.

00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:34.230
It's just like do you think white
Americans think about race as much

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:36.480
as African Americans
think about race?

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:39.120
Do they even think about us as
much as we think about them?

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.420
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: Well--

00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:43.350
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: Maybe some
of you can answer that, too.

00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:45.180
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson:
Yeah, maybe you should.

00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:48.680
You know, it depends on
the white Americans, right.

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.110
Doesn't it, she said.

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:53.420
I would say what-- you know,
this is not something new.

00:30:53.420 --> 00:31:00.340
One of the privileges of being--
of taking your identity and status

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:07.920
for granted is not having to
think about the complexities,

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:11.060
the contradictions, the
difficulties of it all the time.

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:16.640
One of the reasons we are
seeing this venomous backlash

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:20.880
of racism going in multiple
directions, you know,

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:25.860
is that certain groups of white
people are finding that they're--

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:28.630
when they think about their
identity, they are thinking

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:31.260
about challenge, depravation,
you know,

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:36.260
not getting what they used to-- you
know, it's all being rattled up.

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:41.460
But I think traditionally,
white people have been able

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:49.400 position:56%
to choose much more when they wanted
or needed to think or interested in

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:54.390
or even in terms of certain social
forces had to think about it.

00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:55.910
Then, you know, if you live

00:31:55.910 --> 00:31:58.310
in in all white neighborhood,
you could closed out.

00:31:58.310 --> 00:32:01.800
You could-- I think it's
becoming harder now.

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:05.610
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: Sure the Obama
presidency has also made it--

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:06.910 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: I think it was--

00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:08.210
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: -- an issue.

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:09.510
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson:
It was galvanizing

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:10.810
in good and very bad ways.

00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:13.770
It brought a lot of stuff racially

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:16.960
that could be suppressed
or confined.

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:18.490
We, bubbling up for sure.

00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:21.540
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: So I want to
go back to your mother's quote--

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:22.840
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: OK.

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:26.260
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: -- and the freedom
that she found and the totality

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:28.510
of her humanity that she found.

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:33.070
I'd like to get free like that.

00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:35.940
And I wonder how you
feel about your life now.

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:39.570
Do you feel that freedom
that she expressed?

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:40.870
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson:
Well, first of all,

00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:44.350
she didn't feel a little bit tad.

00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:45.650
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: OK.

00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:49.090
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: But she's
still have a joie de vivre,

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:51.530
you know, that.

00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:57.250 position:56%
I feel-- This is-- No, I don't know.

00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:59.880
She also had a much
more deliberately.

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:06.590
She lived the life of an
intelligent upper middle class wife

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:09.090
in the '40s, '50s, and '60s.

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:14.630
And that meant a certain
kind of security albeit

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:16.710
with difficulties as
we feminist know.

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:19.860
That was a life that
you could structure

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:22.220
in certain ways to be pretty safe.

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:25.160
And if you are very
resourceful about it

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:28.190 position:56%
as she was, that pretty much worked.

00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:36.910
My generation, and thank God,
we were shaped by civil rights,

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:41.010
black power, antiwar,
feminism, women's movement,

00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:43.620
gay rights, you know, boom.

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:44.920
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: Right.

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:46.910
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: But the
excitement and the pleasure,

00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:50.800
the story of life, you know, the
sense of freedom was supposed

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:58.810
to partly come from this conflicts
and feeling you had to be made new.

00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:00.570
It's very scary sometimes.

00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:06.420 position:56%
I think often it does leave one more
fracture than fractious and open

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:09.520
to uncertainties and unhappiness.

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:12.140
It's also a-- you know,
it's also kind of thrilling.

00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:14.690
It's pretty thrilling
and it was essential.

00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:16.700
It was just utterly necessary.

00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:19.590
So we're looking for different
kinds of freedom, aren't we?

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:20.890
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: Yeah.

00:34:20.890 --> 00:34:22.190
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: Yeah.

00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:23.490
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: Yeah.

00:34:23.490 --> 00:34:24.790
All right.

00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:26.260
Well, we have to go to
questions from the audience.

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:28.420
[ Applause ]

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:30.060
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: You too, yeah.

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:32.100
[ Applause ]

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:35.890
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: So smile when
you're asking your questions.

00:34:35.890 --> 00:34:38.370
And remember you're
going to be on camera.

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:40.620
Before I call on the first person,

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:45.720
I like to just take a little
personal privilege shamelessly so.

00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:51.730
First of all the Washington Post
is a sponsor of the Book Festival.

00:34:51.730 --> 00:34:54.920
And, you know, for
the last 60 years,

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:57.400
since it's been organized,
we've been a part of it.

00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:02.290
And then also just to say in terms,
if you haven't seen this magazine,

00:35:02.290 --> 00:35:05.770
which is in last Sunday's paper,
it's a commemorative issue

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:08.510
for the Museum of African
American History and Culture.

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:09.860
John Lewis was in it.

00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:13.020
Oprah Winfrey is in it.

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:15.400
Ken Burns was in it.

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:16.700
So many features.

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:18.000
And I wrote the cover story.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.300
I said it was going
to be shameless, so.

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:22.010
Get your hands on it.

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:23.820
[ Applause ]

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:26.950
So we've got about 20-- excellent.

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:28.420
We've got about 20
min for questions.

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:32.210
So I see a gentleman
here at the mic.

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:34.600
You. Yes, you.

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:36.400
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much for you book.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.300
I thoroughly enjoyed it as much

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:40.950
as reading your criticisms
in the New York Times.

00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:42.250
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: Thank you.

00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:43.550
&gt;&gt; And I miss that.

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:45.670
But there was something
that I kind of felt.

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:47.910
In the first part of your
book when you talk about being

00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:54.920
at the lab school and having very
bourgeois protective parents,

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:57.360
did you ever get a chance
to go down to the hood

00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:02.020
and make relationships there
and what kind of empathy

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:05.500
and identifications you
make with the people

00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:07.190
on the other side of Chicago.

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:10.480
I didn't quite get that as much
as I got what was happening

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:13.650
at the lab school in terms
of your relationships.

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:15.280
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson:
Well, that was my school.

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:18.930
But I live until-- we
live in Park Manor,

00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:20.970
which was an all black
neighborhood except

00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:24.680
for the very first
years we moved into it

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:27.050
and until I was in high school.

00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:31.090
And so really everyone
I was around was black.

00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:35.810
I do mention, you know,
in a sheltered way going

00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:42.770
into certain parts of the
hood, 47th in South Park, 63rd.

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:47.390
And I say, there's a story I tell
when I say to my mother, "Oh,

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:52.220
my God, you know, I love being
here, you know, the way people--

00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:54.710
you know, the way black
people are moving and talking.

00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:59.500 position:56%
Did you ever have that feeling
about some special part of Chicago?"

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:02.080
And she said, "Yeah, exactly."

00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:04.780
My parents were-- My
mother grew up in Chicago.

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:07.660
So she was going to, you
know, the Club DeLisa

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:09.850
and the Regal Theater
and all of that.

00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:11.560
I did that with my friends, too.

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:16.190
My parents went to
jazz clubs, you know,

00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:18.130
all of their friends were black.

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:19.910
My father was pediatrician.

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:21.840
He had patients from all classes.

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:29.330 position:56%
But I can't pretend that-- I won't
pretend that we made lots of friends

00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:31.100
across those class lines.

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:32.400
We did not.

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:36.540
But we did live in an
all black neighborhood.

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:41.570
And, you know, I was
most familiar in terms

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:45.150 position:56%
of that day-to-day life with blacks.

00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:48.540
But no, those class lines
were certainly there.

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:51.090 position:56%
And in a certain way, you know, in--

00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:57.430
you know, in terms of the black
music we loved and black language,

00:37:57.430 --> 00:38:01.160
we were slumming a little bit
when we try to imitate it.

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:03.370
We love imitating it.

00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:06.570
But, yeah, we were playing
exotic a little bit.

00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:10.180
That's what class distinctions do.

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:11.480
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: You.

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:15.900
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: And I wanted
to be very honest about that.

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:17.260
&gt;&gt; Hi Ms. Jefferson.

00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:19.860 position:56%
I just had a question about one part

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:23.460
of the book what I thought was
really heart-wrenching was the

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:26.830
moment like you're a kid and you're
playing with these white children

00:38:26.830 --> 00:38:29.210
and you didn't realize that
they were kind of playing

00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:30.680
with a racist joke on you.

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:33.690 position:56%
And it was kind of the heartbreaking
moment when as a parent

00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:37.190
when you have to be swaying your
kids that what was happening

00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:39.190
to them was wrong and that
they should be offended.

00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:42.110
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: You mean the
little girl next door to my mother,

00:38:42.110 --> 00:38:44.680
the one remaining white
person on the block--

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:45.980
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:47.280
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: -- who said,
"Let's play ice from the jungle"--

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:48.580
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:49.880
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: -- and
started to swing her arms?

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:51.480
Yeah. I had-- Thank God,
she was the only one.

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:54.190
No, my grandmother called me in,

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:58.690
"Margo would you come
in the house please?"

00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:01.090
Then she said, you know, "Do
you know what she was doing?

00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:03.940
She was imitating a monkey.

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:06.070
She was saying black
people are monkeys."

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:07.920
I had no idea.

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:10.830
I think I was not allowed to watch.

00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:14.040
We were very-- Our parents was
scrupulous about how much TV,

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:15.900
all parents in the '50s were.

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:19.230
I don't think were allowed to
watch certain cartoons and such

00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:22.420
where blacks would be
regularly depicted as monkeys.

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:27.580
That at the age of nine or so
was just not a stereotype I knew.

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:28.880
&gt;&gt; And I guess my question was--

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:30.710
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson:
And it was excruciating

00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:34.140
because I was mortified
and angry by the girl.

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:39.570
But I was mortified to have
done something so shameful

00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:41.300
in front of my grandmother.

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:42.600
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:44.830
So having the experienced kind
of similar things, I guess,

00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:48.360
my question would just be how
does that kind of affect you

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:51.100
as a kid how you see
yourself once you realized

00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:53.350
that people your own
age are, you know,

00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:55.740
kind of internalizing
these stereotypes

00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:57.250
and projecting them
onto you, I guess.

00:39:57.250 --> 00:39:59.580
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: I
think it's very scary

00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:05.700
and I think what one does, you veer
between suppressing it, you know,

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:09.080
and trying to deal with
what would be, again,

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:10.950
I was at the largely white school.

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:13.160
There were little cluster
of we black people there.

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:16.180
But I went to school
everyday with by kids.

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:21.500
So I had to suppress that enough
to have my everyday relationships

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:23.570
with kids who are not doing that.

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:27.810
On the other hand, you have
to retain that somewhere

00:40:27.810 --> 00:40:32.400
in your consciousness
so that you'll be weary.

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:35.280
You avoid a situation where
it might happen again.

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:41.400
You'll know how to act more boldly
and bravely if it happens again.

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:44.490
So you-- yeah.

00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:49.540
Yeah, you veer between
bearing it and using it.

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:54.180
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: Sir with
the nice Hawaiian shirt.

00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:57.010
&gt;&gt; Yes. I read your book.

00:40:57.010 --> 00:40:59.040
I like it a lot.

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:02.980 position:56%
I can see that the black
experience which I have not had is--

00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:04.280
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: I'm sorry.

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:05.810
&gt;&gt; I said I can see that
the black experience

00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:10.450
which I have not had is certainly
another layer of complexity.

00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:13.320
But I also had the
feeling that, you know,

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:15.920
young white kids are also
learning to be growing up

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:17.220
and learning to be white.

00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:20.330
And they don't know the rules
and they feel the same sort

00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:23.500
of mortification when they
use the wrong word, you know,

00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:25.240
do something embarrassing.

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:29.940
And I wonder how much of your
experience with just growing up,

00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:33.090
which is difficult for anybody.

00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:36.870
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: You
know, it's hard to quantify.

00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:39.560 position:56%
There is a certain kind of childhood

00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:47.370 position:56%
and especially adolescent experience
that, yes, we are all clumsy.

00:41:47.370 --> 00:41:48.670
We all make mistakes.

00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:51.440
We all yearn desperately
to be accepted.

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:54.250
We all struggle with rejection.

00:41:55.540 --> 00:42:01.910
The fact is I had as a
black person, you know,

00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:07.780
the racialized I rather than, you
know, the, oh, poor me, intimate I.

00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:13.490
Any young black child had
an additional level layer,

00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:18.280
call it what you want of
pure race consciousness

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:24.080
that could express itself in
anything from innocent mistakes,

00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:26.390
maybe something you picked
up from a grandparent.

00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:33.060
You didn't know what it meant
to bigotry, open bigotry--

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:39.440
you know, whatever, to, you
know, just getting along fine.

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:45.290
I don't think that-- I know
that level of racial weariness

00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:49.620
and watchfulness was just it wasn't
there if you were a white person.

00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:51.440
Unless you are a white--

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:56.780
very conscious white person
in a largely black setting.

00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:59.940 position:56%
That would be a different situation.

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:01.240
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: OK.

00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:02.540
I see two questions here.

00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:07.450
&gt;&gt; I just wanted to ask
about, in particular,

00:43:07.450 --> 00:43:11.830
the way in which you see the
Negroland of 2016, and I ask this

00:43:11.830 --> 00:43:13.130
from a position of teaching

00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:16.590
at a pretty [inaudible]
independent school in Washington,

00:43:16.590 --> 00:43:22.660
DC where the consumption of black
cultures is now very much central

00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:24.770
to the way in which we operate.

00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:27.660
That's part of what's happening
even in our political landscape.

00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:28.960
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: Yeah.

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:32.330 position:56%
&gt;&gt; That black cultures are being
consumed more readily by more people

00:43:32.330 --> 00:43:37.480
in being digested whether
consciously or unconsciously--

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:38.780
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: Absolutely.

00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:40.080
&gt;&gt; -- oftentimes.

00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:41.720
And I'm just wondering in looking
at that consumptious [phonetic],

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:45.180
that conspicuous consumption
looking at it,

00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:50.680
do you see the Negroland shifting
in 2016, these Negrolands,

00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:54.140
are those spaces having to
adapt and to adjust to the way

00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:58.160
in which the cultural
landscape is moving

00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:00.250
and those new tensions
that are being created?

00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:01.550
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: Absolutely.

00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:04.090
First of all, it's been
having to adjust just

00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:07.740
within my lifetime it started
to have to adjust, you know,

00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:12.630
with these upheavals of the
'60s and '70s, absolutely.

00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:15.720
And the upheaval even
included certain kinds

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:17.530
of more intense integration.

00:44:17.530 --> 00:44:21.670
Now I think you're talking about
this mass cultural consumption,

00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:24.200
is that right, because-- yeah.

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:30.480
You bet. It means for among
many things that Negrolanders

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:39.590
of the so-called black elite has
to acknowledge, respect the fluent

00:44:39.590 --> 00:44:46.290
in many more kinds of black
culture than they once had to.

00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:49.200
And that is only a good thing.

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:50.500
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:51.800
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: But yeah.

00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:53.100
&gt;&gt; I think I ask up a
guy was just at Dance

00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:54.400
with the Kids and I
notice how much--

00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:55.700
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: You think what?

00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:57.000
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: I was at a
dance like chaperoning the Dance

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.980
with the Kids and they're
so on to like rap music now

00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:03.710
and like all these new things that
I think are like very different

00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:06.400
than like what have been 50
years ago and like that's

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:08.370 position:56%
like all the kids were consuming in.

00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:12.200
I'm like black culture
is much more central now.

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:14.740
And I'm wondering how does
that affect it when you talk

00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:18.690
about black culture
and black wealth.

00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:19.990
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson:
You know, I think--

00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:23.000
You know, I think that
actually to people first talking

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.820
about the effect of The Jackson 5.

00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:33.680
That sense, whether you like all of
it or not of being unquestionably

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:38.320
at the center of the culture
is a very different thing,

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:43.930
in a way that's it can though,
you know, less controlled

00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:47.190
to what were saying at the
beginning about the Museum

00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:50.670
of African American History
in the center of this nation.

00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:55.090
No one can deny whether it's, you
know, on the pages of a magazine

00:45:55.090 --> 00:46:00.520
or a newspaper or, you know, on
your computer that black culture

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:04.430
in every way from rap to books

00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:09.190
to TV shows [inaudible]
is absolutely central

00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:12.100
to this thing we call
American culture.

00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:16.640
That gives you a very
different sense of yourself.

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:22.640
It means you're not a footnote
or only a problem or a kind

00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:27.830
of supplicant or the forced--
forced to be always the rebel.

00:46:27.830 --> 00:46:30.390
You can still be all of those
things but you don't have

00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:33.050
to be a supplicant or
a footnote anymore.

00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:36.020
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: So let's do our--
we've got time for one question,

00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:43.170
one more question, I
see the gentleman there.

00:46:43.170 --> 00:46:46.350
&gt;&gt; Hi. This may or
may not be related

00:46:46.350 --> 00:46:48.640
to what you were talking about.

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:54.690
But you said something about-- or
one of the things is in cognizant

00:46:54.690 --> 00:47:00.810
of the block experience and
different from like white

00:47:00.810 --> 00:47:05.380
or how much do you think
about these things?

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:17.250
And I always wondering if-- or
like, that relates to other things

00:47:17.250 --> 00:47:20.440
that like-- did you happen to--

00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:25.760
or did you come across how it
may be related to thinking about,

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:31.880
I don't know, being disabled
versus not being disabled.

00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:33.180
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson: Yeah.

00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:36.350
I could see an analogy
there, absolutely.

00:47:36.350 --> 00:47:43.910
If you are not, to use your
phrasing, if you are disabled,

00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:46.890
you have to constantly
compare yourself

00:47:46.890 --> 00:47:53.040
to what is declared the societal
norm, which is not being disabled.

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:57.030
If you are not disabled,
you have much more room

00:47:57.030 --> 00:48:00.010
to take yourself for granted.

00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:04.020
It would also seem to me
that one of the other things

00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:07.040
that would analogous would be the--

00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:10.150
sense constantly of
self consciousness,

00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:17.060
how are you being viewed by this
other world be it the normal world

00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:21.860
of white people or the normal world
of men often or the normal world

00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:25.400
of the abled, the not disabled.

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:30.740
So yeah, I definitely see a
consciousness analogy there.

00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:32.040
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: Thank
you for your question.

00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:33.340
Thank you all for you questions.

00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:34.640
And thank you Ms. Jefferson.

00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:37.450
&gt;&gt; Margo Jefferson:
Thank you Marcia Davis.

00:48:37.450 --> 00:48:39.880
[ Applause ]

00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:41.220
Thank you.

00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:44.430
It's a great book fair.

00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:48.090
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
