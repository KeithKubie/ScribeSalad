00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.833
(whoosh)

00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:05.560
(mouse click)
(digital jingle)

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.477
(soft piano music)

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.450
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape,

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.356
bipedal, naked, large-brained,

00:00:15.356 --> 00:00:17.560
(soft piano music)

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.713
long the master of fire,
tools, and language,

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.023
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.893
Aware that death is inevitable,
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.683
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.243
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.470
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.940
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.693
understanding of the past.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.160
Carta brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.703
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here,

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.970
an exploration made possible

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.905
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:00.905 --> 00:01:03.072
(fanfare)

00:01:15.355 --> 00:01:18.438
(synthesized jingle)

00:01:20.777 --> 00:01:23.860
(soft digital music)

00:01:35.203 --> 00:01:36.036
- Thank you.

00:01:36.036 --> 00:01:39.903
It's a pleasure to be here
at this fabulous symposium.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.350
I will be talking about mathematics,

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.090
and mathematics is perhaps

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.850
one of the most abstract,
complex, and precise

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.250
human conceptual systems ever invented.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.873
Think about the Euclidean
point, for example.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.130
It's an entity that has only
one property, that's location.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.590
No extension whatsoever, so
no Euclidean point exists

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.600
really objectively in the universe,

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.630
and we have no biology to
perceive a Euclidean point,

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.760
yet the Euclidean point,
the humble little guy

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.270
is the cornerstone of the
edifice of Euclidean geometry

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.680
that led to Analytic geometry,
non-Euclidean geometries,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.143
differential geometries, many
other fields in mathematics.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.933
One area

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.260
that we could look at for the origins

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.130
of this fabulous human conceptual system

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.793
is abstracting its number.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.040
To begin consider the following.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.790
If you presented let's
say with this stimuli,

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.340
it's very easy for us to
discriminate between them,

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.700
but when the amount of dots
increases, it's not as easy,

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.870
and we make a few more mistakes,
and we make confusions.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.420
Now, the capacity to discriminate

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.920
when there is only few of them

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.690
is called subitizing and is being studied

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.623
by experimental psychologists
since the 1940s.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.650
This is an ability we don't
need to go to school to,

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.980
and we share with many other species.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.700
Another ability is the following.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.320
If we presented let's say
with these groups of dots,

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.530
black and white, when their
proportions differ considerably

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.930
it's very easy for us to
say which one has more

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.170
even though we may not
know exactly how many,

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.750
but we can tell.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.480
When the proportions are
closer to each other,

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.710
it's a little harder and
sometimes very, very difficult.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.560
This capacity is referred to

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.810
as Large Quantity Discrimination.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.350
Now, these two capacities we share

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.590
with many other species as I was saying,

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.600
so this has led to many really to believe

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.230
that this is about now mathematics.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.450
You would tend to see
many papers and chapters

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.440
and academic material talking about

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.380
monkey mathematical
abilities and kids in infancy

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.710
without schooling and arithmetic occurring

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.210
at a single-neuron level
and so on and so forth,

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.290
all the way to more recently

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.800
numerical cognition in
bees and other insects.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.390
Now, of course, this is academia,

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.800
and then the media takes over and says,

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.770
well, like the New York Times here

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:19.980
science section earlier this year,

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.563
many animals can count,
some better than you,

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.340
and I know there's some
individuals in power now

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.670
who will also say the New York Times

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.270
report on fake news these days,
but that's not the only one.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.770
Sometimes we see animals with tools

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.550
and kind of lead us to think that

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.890
there's some kind of
mathematical content involved,

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.670
or let's say this one,
(audience laughs)

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.423
fish as good as college
students in numbers test,

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.240
and mosquitofish can count
up to 100, count in quotes.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.730
That whole thing as a
package in this society,

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.510
there's kind of a widely accepted view

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.060
that says there's a
biologically evolved capacity

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.270
that is specific for
number and arithmetic,

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.350
and I underlined here the word specific.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.340
Now, of course, the question
is is it really the case?

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.360
And there's been some debate more lately,

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.870
and part of the issue is that

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.480
some of these terms are polysemous.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.450
Number we use it for passport number,

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.110
telephone number, and many other things,

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.200
so what do we really mean by number?

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.480
And it turns out that in the literature,

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.290
the scientific literature
is permeated really

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.170
with underspecified
conceptions of what is numbers

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.780
such that we can describe
numerical and arithmetical

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.100
and mathematical capacities
to many other species.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.950
Let's examine this a little bit more.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.400
If we leave aside nonhuman
animals for a moment,

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.210
we can focus on human data
that has been overlooked.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.270
For example, all known languages have

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.400
natural quantifiers like few,
several, many, and so on,

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.850
but by no means they all
exhibit exact quantification.

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:56.840
A recent study of about 200 languages

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.540
in aboriginal Australia from 13 different

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.180
linguistic families show that in fact

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.180
almost 90% of these languages
do not have a numeral

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.530
beyond what we would call five.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:14.180
You can't in the cultures
speaking these languages refer to

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.103
seven or 12 or 19 or 23.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.750
Now, similar research has been
found with hunter-gatherers

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.180
in Australia and Africa and South America,

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.970
and I strongly recommend also the book

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.430
by Caleb Everett that goes more in-depth

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.560
analyzing these particular cultures.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.823
Now the point is here that
when we look at human language,

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.300
language by itself really does not lead

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.530
to number beyond the subitizing range,

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.870
so exact quantification seems to be

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.623
a cultural trait, not a biological trait.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:54.320
How do we get from perceiving,
let's say, these dots

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.990
to labeling them as, let's
say, being nine or eight

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.840
whether with spoken words or with digits?

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.630
Well, when we do that we're involved

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:05.950
in what is called symbolic reference.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:09.420
It's not just a purely
psychophysical perception anymore,

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:12.830
it's now another cognitive
activity like symbolic reference,

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:15.390
and we can do this with many other types

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:18.440
of numerals like in
Spanish nueve and ocho,

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.720
or we could do Roman
Numerals and other forms

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.350
and different bases in mathematics

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:24.790
or infinite decimal limitation

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:27.410
if you like and so on and so forth,

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:29.450
and there's another important property.

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:31.970
It's they are relational and operable.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.986
My laptop computer here says number eight,

00:07:34.986 --> 00:07:38.670
is that equivalent to the
product of two and four,

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.700
it's one more than seven and those things,

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.960
so they're all related to each other.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.260
Really our familiar list one, two, three

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.810
has very specific abstract properties,

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:53.610
like it quantifies exactly,
not an approximate way,

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:57.250
and it is abstract in
sending stimulus modality,

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:58.650
visual or auditory.

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:00.750
It has a cardinal sense, an ordinal sense,

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:05.370
a relational property, which
is all combinative, operable,

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:09.505
and most importantly
referred to symbolically.

00:08:09.505 --> 00:08:13.440
Number really is exact
symbolic quantification,

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.510
and this seems to be quite different

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:17.300
from what we observed, let's say,

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.830
with trained, by humans of course,

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:22.640
trained animals in the
lab where you can get,

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.700
for example, monkeys in
painstaking training,

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:29.540
four months, 20,000 trials
to discriminate dots

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:34.540
in a ratio three to four
only to 70% of accuracy.

00:08:34.663 --> 00:08:37.263
It seems to be that we're
in a different realm here.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:41.590
To summarize here we
can look at this figure.

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:44.320
Essentially what we have is
amount of discreet stuff,

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.230
let's say dots, going
from center to periphery,

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:49.690
increasing in amount.

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:52.963
What you see in your bottom left here,

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:57.330
what you have is subitizing a
large quantity discrimination,

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.650
the two abilities we just exercised

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:01.140
a little bit at the beginning,

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:04.220
and we share those with many species.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:08.760
Now, with symbolic reference,
there's a symbolic gap there,

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.650
we can then label things
like natural quantifies

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:14.700
like many, few, and so on,

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.330
and then with exact
quantification we get it

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.240
to what you see clockwise there in blue,

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.000
which is now truly numerical.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.550
The point is here what you see on the left

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:30.020
is really about quantity perception.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:33.760
It's quantical abilities
are biologically endowed,

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.713
but in order to really get to number,

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.610
we need to go across
the symbolic reference

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:42.770
and that is not biologically evolvable.

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:45.210
Here I'm gonna borrow a
quote from Terry Deacon,

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:47.407
also a member of Carta, who says,

00:09:47.407 --> 00:09:49.900
"Symbolic reference must
be acquired by learning,"

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:52.277
so this occurs in the
ontogeny of individuals,

00:09:52.277 --> 00:09:54.667
"and lacks both the natural associations

00:09:54.667 --> 00:09:57.127
"and trans-generational
reproductive consequences

00:09:57.127 --> 00:10:00.787
"that would make such references
biologically evolvable."

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:04.370
So exact symbolic quantification

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:08.270
beyond the subitizing range
really needs a whole apparatus,

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:12.910
a culture that actually cares
about being exact and precise,

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:14.730
motivated by cultural preoccupations,

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:18.050
tracking valuables, trading,
accounting, and so on,

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:20.830
and is supported by and enhanced by tools

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:25.113
and off-loading cognition
which requires enculturation.

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:27.390
Of course, part of that comes,

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:29.660
and we heard already
previously about this,

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.580
the invention of writing
about 6,000 years ago

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:36.640
initially according to many
authors coming from tokens.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.380
Tokens printed on envelope of clays,

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:42.475
eventually leading to clay tablets,

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:45.720
but you could also have
in the absence of writing,

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:50.720
for example, like the Inca did
with the use of the quipus,

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.710
performing amazingly sophisticated

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:56.640
calculations without writing,

00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:00.210
or what you see in those
Shahinian Papua New Guinea

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:03.310
many groups you have now grammatical tools

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:05.030
in the language that could, for example,

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:08.440
codify certain types of morophemes

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.470
that would characterize
number of quantities

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:12.080
for counting things you care about.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.000
For example, in this case
as you see in the picture,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.260
yams in the culture Nen

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.163
worked on by Nick Evans.

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:23.440
What's in common there is that you need

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.870
a conventionalized symbolic reference

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:28.443
for exact quantification.

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:30.123
Now,

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:36.200
when there is number most number systems

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.270
are in base five or 10, and
you will say, "Why is that?"

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:42.620
Well, here we have a very handy tool

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:43.970
all the sudden in front of us.

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:46.850
You can identify fingers,
and we can sort of,

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:48.150
they're readily available.

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:50.350
That could explain part of it.

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:53.090
The issue is that gorillas, chimpanzees,

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:56.613
many species, raccoons,
they also are pentadactyl,

00:11:56.613 --> 00:11:59.060
so they also have five fingers.

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:01.823
Evolution there giving
that particular form.

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:03.723
We have that.

00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:04.760
We have brains that control

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.010
and get all the inputs, et cetera,

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:09.890
but what we don't have in this
case is symbolic reference,

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:14.410
the capacity to actually use
this as now potential tools,

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:16.950
which doesn't come with a handbook.

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:18.640
Cultural variations exist

00:12:19.795 --> 00:12:21.920
in how you actually use
the hand for counting.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.450
Here you have at the
top right number eight

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:26.350
being characterized bi-manually,

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:28.840
uni-manually, sometimes using the fingers,

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:32.050
sometimes using the finger joints.

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:34.260
Number eight if you use simple joints,

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.240
and the tip would be this, for example,

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.760
and so on in some cultures.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:42.380
Now, when there is written
exact symbolic number,

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:44.330
it seems all this to be mediated

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:48.020
by culturally shaped cortical
phenotypical plasticity.

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.160
According to this work by Tang et al,

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:55.160
for example, they presented
digits to English speakers

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:57.040
and Chinese native speakers,

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.010
and they just asked to do
very simple calculations,

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:02.400
and what we observe is
very different recruitment

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.720
for neural populations in the two groups.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:09.910
You see more recruitment
in the left hemisphere

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:13.350
perisylvian area in the
English speakers and much

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:17.400
let's say more in premotor
regions for the Chinese speakers.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:22.400
Number then really what we
have is a language mediated,

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:26.050
conventionalized exact
symbolic quantification,

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:27.740
which is a cultural trait,

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:30.380
and this occurring quite, quite recently

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:33.853
and largely outside of
biological evolution.

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:38.350
It builds on biologically
evolved pre-conditions.

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:41.450
We need subitizing in large
quantity discrimination,

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:45.080
but themselves they not
mathematical or numerical.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:48.390
These are motivated by cultural
preoccupations as I said,

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:51.150
supported crucially by
material and conceptual tools

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:55.130
and the biology that makes
enculturation possible.

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:57.070
I wanna take this now to the next step.

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:59.070
Once we have numbers we can start creating

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:00.800
all kinds of other things.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:05.310
One, a very ubiquitous, powerful
tool is the number line,

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:07.180
which now we need another system,

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:10.560
which is to conceive numbers
as locations in space,

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.140
metaphorically if you will.

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:14.400
Now this, of course, many
of the talks before this one

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.593
we're using graphs to
characterize amounts and so on,

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.480
it's helpful for reading economic graphs

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:26.730
and look at scientific data
or develop vector spaces

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:29.910
and fancy visualizations and so on.

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:32.530
What is interesting is that these days

00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:36.760
this is learned or
presented in kindergarten.

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:38.370
Kindergartens already start to see

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:40.560
little bunnies jumping back and forth,

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:44.280
and froggies doing jumping,
jumps and so on and so forth.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.520
This has led a lot of people
to think that perhaps we have,

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.390
again, a biologically
endowed mental number line,

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:52.540
which is housed in the
intraparietal sulcus

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:53.613
of the human brain.

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:56.880
Well, that's true if you
only look at westerners

00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:00.233
who already went to school
and know how these work.

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.770
A lot of papers support the idea

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:06.240
that you would have very
spontaneous mappings

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.270
occurring in infants, in macaques,

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:11.390
and more recently a paper in Science

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:13.560
saying that newborn chicks now,

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.163
so go figure what kind of
cortex they would have,

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:20.890
would actually have a mental
number line like humans.

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:23.550
Now, if that were really the case,

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:25.940
let's cross that with
some other type of data.

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:28.750
For example, we would expect culture,

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:31.770
number savvy cultures
like Babylonia, let's say,

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:34.330
to have some manifestation of number lines

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.260
somewhere in all the
number crunching they did.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.100
Well, when you look at
half a million tablets

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:42.050
that we know today, there's
not a single number line there.

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:43.843
That says something.

00:15:43.843 --> 00:15:46.440
They did a lot of numbers
without a number line.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.990
In fact you have to go to 17th century.

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.390
It's not even in La
Geometrie by Rene Descartes,

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:55.240
who invented analytic geometry.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.470
Not a single number line there either.

00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:00.690
The first appears to be John Napier

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:02.450
when he is introducing of logarithms,

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:06.507
a very sophisticated
notion, and he is saying,

00:16:06.507 --> 00:16:07.357
"Okay, here is a line.

00:16:07.357 --> 00:16:09.450
"We're gonna start thinking this way."

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:11.680
But the first who does an operational

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.040
use of a number line is John Wallis,

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:17.600
and here if you really look
at the text, he says, okay,

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.920
talking, the audience
is la creme de la creme,

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.750
the top of the top of mathematicians

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:23.687
in Europe in 17th century saying,

00:16:23.687 --> 00:16:26.067
"Think of a man walking five steps

00:16:26.067 --> 00:16:27.587
"and then walking two back,

00:16:27.587 --> 00:16:30.940
"and that's gonna be five
minus two equals three."

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.260
That's what you hear today
in a kindergarten class,

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.800
but this is now a few
hundred years ago in Europe.

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.930
We also wanted to test
how spontaneous is this?

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:41.030
We went and we did a study

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:43.220
among the Yupno of Papua New Guinea,

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:47.830
and we presented a line
segment, following other methods

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:50.630
that had been introduced in the Amazon,

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:52.570
and we could see that, for example,

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:57.570
even though they had numbers
to at least 20 in numerals,

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:01.010
they essentially mapped small numbers

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:03.530
on one end and bigger to the other end

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:06.970
whether it was dots or
tones or other things

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:11.310
unlike the school Yupno
and California Control's

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:13.490
as you see on the right side.

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:18.110
The red one being the unschooled
using only the extremes.

00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:20.500
No use of the path whatsoever,

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:22.600
which is required for the number line.

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.150
The intuition doesn't seem to be,

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:26.463
again, universal in that sense.

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:29.100
What do we do with these abstractions?

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:31.130
Well, we do crazy things.

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:32.570
Of course we have the mathematicians

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:35.130
very recently developing it,

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:38.223
but today it's introduced
in the kindergarten class,

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:43.960
but this could be taken
to further directions

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.440
to develop the notions of hyperreal lines.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:49.340
All the sudden now the
number line on the real line,

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:53.180
which is now housing irrational
numbers and rational numbers

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:55.160
and by virtue of the
least-upper-bound axiom,

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.320
you have a complete ordered field.

00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:00.090
No more dots could fit in there.

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:03.030
Well, you can when you go
to non-Euclidean numbers,

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:05.530
infinitely tiny, infinitely small numbers,

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:07.120
the epsilons you see there,

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:10.420
or huge numbers, their
reciprocals, the omegas,

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:13.930
that are bigger and larger
than any real number.

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:17.090
Then you start to have
embedded, mutually incompatible,

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:19.370
non-commensurable number lines embedded

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:24.060
in infinitely many spots in
infinitely many of these lines.

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:27.150
All this going back to
the simple number line

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:29.690
that we develop a few hundred years ago.

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:33.800
Really the story of numbers
and tools in mathematics

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:37.100
can be reduced to this process
of enculturation where you do

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:39.790
need a biological apparatus
that would support it.

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:41.440
I would like to close with this quote,

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:43.810
and I thank Pascal Gagneux for pointing me

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:45.530
to this one by geneticist

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:49.067
and evolutionary biologist
Theodosius Dobzhansky who said,

00:18:49.067 --> 00:18:51.567
"Human evolution has two components,

00:18:51.567 --> 00:18:53.347
"the biological or organic,

00:18:53.347 --> 00:18:55.617
"and the cultural or superorganic.

00:18:55.617 --> 00:18:58.077
"These components are
neither mutually exclusive

00:18:58.077 --> 00:19:01.787
"nor independent, but
interrelated and interdependent.

00:19:01.787 --> 00:19:04.127
"Human evolution cannot be understood

00:19:04.127 --> 00:19:06.347
"as a purely biological process,

00:19:06.347 --> 00:19:09.877
"nor can it be adequately
described as a history of culture.

00:19:09.877 --> 00:19:13.100
"It is the interaction
of biology and culture,"

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:16.690
and I think mathematics
exemplifies this perfectly well.

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:18.048
Thank you.

00:19:18.048 --> 00:19:21.035
(audience applauds)

00:19:21.035 --> 00:19:24.285
