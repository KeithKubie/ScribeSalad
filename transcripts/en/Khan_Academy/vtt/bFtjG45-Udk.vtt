00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.770
And now I want to do a bunch
of examples dealing with

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.160
probably the two most typical
types of polynomial

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.550
multiplication that you'll see,
definitely, in algebra.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.640
And the first is just
squaring a binomial.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:20.600
So if I have x plus 9 squared, I
know that your temptation is

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.630
going to say, oh, isn't that
x squared plus 9 squared?

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.260
And I'll say, no, it isn't.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
You have to resist every
temptation on the

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.660
planet to do this.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.280
It is not x squared
plus 9 squared.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:40.610
Remember, x plus 9 squared,
this is equal to x plus 9,

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.630
times x plus 9.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.940
This is a multiplication of this
binomial times itself.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.350
You always need to
remember that.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.900
It's very tempting to think that
it's just x squared plus

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.760
9 squared, but no, you have
to expand it out.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.160
And now that we've expanded it
out, we can use some of the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.250
skills we learned in the last
video to actually multiply it.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.370
And just to show you that we can
do it in the way that we

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.910
multiplied the trinomial last
time, let's multiply x plus 9,

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.760
times x plus a magenta 9.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.850
And I'm doing it this way just
to show you when I'm

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.880
multiplying by this
9 versus this x.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.740
But let's just do it.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.970
So we go 9 times 9 is 81.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.800
Put it in the constants'
place.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.630
9 times x is 9x.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.830
Then we have-- go switch to this
x term-- we have a yellow

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.240
x. x times 9x is 9x.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.022
Put it in the first
degree space.

00:01:38.022 --> 00:01:40.960
x times x is x squared.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.700
And then we add everything up.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:52.520
And we get x squared
plus 18x plus 81.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.650
So this is equal to x squared
plus 18x plus 81.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.560
Now you might see a little bit
of a pattern here, and I'll

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.965
actually make the pattern
explicit in a second.

00:02:02.965 --> 00:02:06.010
But when you square a binomial,
what happened?

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.750
You have x squared.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.190
You have this x times this
x, gives you x squared.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.920
You have the 9 times
the 9, which is 81.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.950
And then you have this term
here which is 18x.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.910
How did we get that 18x?

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.210
Well, we multiplied this x times
9 to get 9x, and then we

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.510
multiplied this 9 times
x to get another 9x.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.960
And then we added the two
right here to get 18x.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.250
So in general, whenever you have
a squared binomial-- let

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.890
me do it this way.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.250
I'll do it in very general
terms. Let's say we have a

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.630
plus b squared.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.740
Let me multiply it this way
again, just to give you the

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:45.630
hang of it.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:53.250
This is equal to a plus b, times
a plus-- I'll do a green

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.770
b right there.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.440
So we have to b times
b is b squared.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.410
Let's just assume that this
is a constant term.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.510
I'll put it in the b squared
right there.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.860
I'm assuming this is constant.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.060
So this would be a constant,
this would be

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.660
analogous to our 81.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.640
a is a variable that we--
actually let me change that up

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.040
even better.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:21.270
Let me make this into x plus b
squared, and we're assuming b

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:22.750
is a constant.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:30.890
So it would be x plus b, times x
plus a green b, right there.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.700
So assuming b's a constant,
b times b is b squared.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.060
b times x is bx.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.090
And then we'll do
the magenta x.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.140
x times b is bx.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.900
And then x times
x is x squared.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.330
So when you add everything,
you're left with x squared

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:56.840
plus 2bx, plus b squared.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.010
So what you see is, the end
product, what you have when

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.340
you have x plus b squared, is
x squared, plus 2 times the

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.490
product of x and b,
plus b squared.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.750
So given that pattern, let's
do a bunch more of these.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.709
And I'm going to do
it the fast way.

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.850
So 3x minus 7 squared.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.980
Let's just remember
what I told you.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.340
Just don't remember it, in the
back of your mind, you should

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.780
know why it makes sense.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.350
If I were to multiply this
out, do the distributive

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.740
property twice, you know you'll
get the same answer.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:44.730
So this is going to be equal
to 3x squared, plus 2 times

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.990
3x, times negative 7.

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.280
Right?

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.630
We know that it's 2 times each
the product of these terms,

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.700
plus negative 7 squared.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.200
And if we use our product rules
here, 3x squared is the

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.950
same thing as 9x squared.

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.440
This right here, you're going
to have a 2 times a 3, which

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.980
is 6, times a negative 7,
which is negative 42x.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.670
And then a negative 7
squared is plus 49.

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:17.930
That was the fast way.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.600
And just to make sure that I'm
not doing something bizarre,

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.950
let me do it the slow
way for you.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:32.320
3x minus 7, times 3x minus 7.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.940
Negative 7 times negative
7 is positive 49.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:42.310
Negative 7 times 3x
is negative 21x.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:47.220
3x times negative 7
is negative 21x.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:52.280
3x times 3x is 9 x squared.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.060
Scroll to the left
a little bit.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.050
Add everything.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:02.060
You're left with 9x squared,
minus 42x, plus 49.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.050
So we did indeed get
the same answer.

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.580
Let's do one more, and we'll
do it the fast way.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.130
So if we have 8x minus 3--
actually, let me do one which

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.920
has more variables in it.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:19.370
Let's say we had 4x squared plus
y squared, and we wanted

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.360
to square that.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.720
Well, same idea.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.820
This is going to be equal to
this term squared, 4x squared,

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:32.840
squared, plus 2 times the
product of both terms, 2 times

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:39.210
4x squared times y
squared, plus y

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.710
squared, this term, squared.

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.800
And what's this going
to be equal to?

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.430
This is going to be equal to
16-- right, 4 squared is 16--

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:53.320
x squared, squared, that's 2
times 2, so it's x to the

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.730
fourth power.

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:58.330
And then plus, 2 times
4 times 1, that's

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.820
8x squared y squared.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:07.300
And then y squared, squared,
is y to the fourth.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.390
Now, we've been dealing with
squaring a binomial.

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:13.140
The next example I want to show
you is when I take the

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.700
product of a sum and
a difference.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.350
And this one actually comes
out pretty neat.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.160
So I'm going to do a very
general one for you.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:28.160
Let's just do a plus
b, times a minus b.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.400
So what's this going
to be equal to?

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:36.660
This is going to be equal to a
times a-- let me make these

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:41.260
actually in different colors--
so a minus b, just like that.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:45.900
So it's going to be this green
a times this magenta a, a

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:55.380
times a, plus, or maybe I should
say minus, the green a

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:56.670
times this b.

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:59.560
I got the minus from
right there.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:04.370
And then we're going to have the
green b, so plus the green

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:07.230
b times the magenta a.

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:10.920
I'm just multiplying every
term by every term.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:17.250
And then finally minus the green
b-- that's where the

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.050
minus is coming from--
minus the green b

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:22.370
times the magenta b.

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:23.590
And what is this going
to be equal to?

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:27.220
This is going to be equal
to a squared, and then

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:29.020
this is minus ab.

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.840
This could be rewritten as
plus ab, and then we have

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.039
minus b squared.

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:39.130
These right here cancel out,
minus ab plus ab, so you're

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:42.600
just left with a squared
minus b squared.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.430
Which is a really neat
result because it

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:46.120
really simplifies things.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.190
So let's use that notion to
do some multiplication.

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:55.470
So if we say 2x minus
1, times 2x plus 1.

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:56.710
Well, these are the
same thing.

00:08:56.710 --> 00:09:01.810
The 2x plus 1, you could view
this as, if you like, a plus

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:06.750
b, and the 2x minus 1, you can
view it as a minus b, where

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:10.830
this is a, and that b is 1.

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:13.440
This is b.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.010
That is a.

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:18.660
Just using this pattern that
we figured out just now.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:19.680
So what is this going
to be equal to?

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:24.820
It's going to be a squared, it's
going to be 2x squared,

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:29.490
minus b squared, minus
1 squared.

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:32.790
2x squared is 4x squared.

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:36.180
1 squared is just
1, so minus 1.

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:39.210
So it's going to be 4x
squared minus 1.

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:41.560
Let's do one more of these,
just to really

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.890
hit the point home.

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:47.290
I'll just focus on
multiplication right now.

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:52.040
If I have 5a minus 2b, and
I'm multiplying that

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.910
times 5a plus 2b.

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:58.640
And remember, this only applies
when I have at a

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.750
product of a sum and
a difference.

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:02.410
That's the only time that
I can use this.

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:03.850
And I've shown you why.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:06.320
And if you're ever in doubt,
just multiply it out.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.880
It'll take you a little
bit longer.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.630
And you'll see the terms
canceling out.

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:13.070
You can't do this for just any
binomial multiplication.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:14.590
You saw that earlier in the
video, when we were

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:17.080
multiplying, when we were
taking squares.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.560
So this is going to be, using
the pattern, it's going to be

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:28.310
5a squared minus 2b squared,
which is equal to 25 a squared

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:31.400
minus 4b squared.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.330
And, well, I'll leave it there,
and I'll see you in the

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:35.900
next video.
