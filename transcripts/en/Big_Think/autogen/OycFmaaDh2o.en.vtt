my name is David shank and I'm author of

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:10.540
my name is David shank and I'm author of
 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.570
my name is David shank and I'm author of
a new book called the genius in all of

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:12.580
a new book called the genius in all of
 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.190
a new book called the genius in all of
us

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:16.200
 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.920
genius is an amorphous term to be sure

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930
genius is an amorphous term to be sure
 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.540
genius is an amorphous term to be sure
and I actually try to stay away from it

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550
and I actually try to stay away from it
 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.810
and I actually try to stay away from it
in the book the what I what I talk about

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820
in the book the what I what I talk about
 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.450
in the book the what I what I talk about
in the book mostly is this idea of high

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460
in the book mostly is this idea of high
 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.790
in the book mostly is this idea of high
achievement so people becoming great at

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800
achievement so people becoming great at
 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.290
achievement so people becoming great at
stuff becoming really really good at

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300
stuff becoming really really good at
 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.910
stuff becoming really really good at
stuff I don't think it's really

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920
stuff I don't think it's really
 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.120
stuff I don't think it's really
important to make a dividing line some

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130
important to make a dividing line some
 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.680
important to make a dividing line some
to try to figure out you know when

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690
to try to figure out you know when
 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.049
to try to figure out you know when
you've crossed over into into genius the

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059
you've crossed over into into genius the
 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.710
you've crossed over into into genius the
point is gathering your resources doing

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720
point is gathering your resources doing
 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.170
point is gathering your resources doing
the best you can pursuing whatever it is

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180
the best you can pursuing whatever it is
 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.040
the best you can pursuing whatever it is
you love to do with with an intensity

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050
you love to do with with an intensity
 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.720
you love to do with with an intensity
and a resilience and a passion and and

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730
and a resilience and a passion and and
 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.290
and a resilience and a passion and and
just going as far as you can possibly go

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300
 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.210
we've been living with this myth for

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220
we've been living with this myth for
 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.860
we've been living with this myth for
about a hundred hundred and fifty years

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870
about a hundred hundred and fifty years
 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.210
about a hundred hundred and fifty years
going back to the time of Darwin

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220
going back to the time of Darwin
 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.600
going back to the time of Darwin
although I'm not blaming Darwin for this

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610
although I'm not blaming Darwin for this
 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.250
although I'm not blaming Darwin for this
all they've if the blame resides

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260
all they've if the blame resides
 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.450
all they've if the blame resides
anywhere it's really with Darwin's

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460
anywhere it's really with Darwin's
 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.280
anywhere it's really with Darwin's
cousin Francis Galton and we can get

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290
cousin Francis Galton and we can get
 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.520
cousin Francis Galton and we can get
into that if you like but so the idea is

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530
into that if you like but so the idea is
 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.090
into that if you like but so the idea is
that we we think that its nature versus

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100
that we we think that its nature versus
 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.390
that we we think that its nature versus
nurture that there's there's genes that

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400
nurture that there's there's genes that
 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.120
nurture that there's there's genes that
that have all this information that kind

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130
that have all this information that kind
 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.110
that have all this information that kind
of want to push us in a certain

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120
of want to push us in a certain
 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.640
of want to push us in a certain
direction and then there's the

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650
direction and then there's the
 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.340
direction and then there's the
environment which is nurture which is

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350
environment which is nurture which is
 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.980
environment which is nurture which is
which is obviously different and kind of

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990
which is obviously different and kind of
 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.550
which is obviously different and kind of
an opposing force and and it's kind of

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560
an opposing force and and it's kind of
 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.230
an opposing force and and it's kind of
either/or and there's all these studies

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240
either/or and there's all these studies
 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.490
either/or and there's all these studies
that are constantly trying to figure out

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500
that are constantly trying to figure out
 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.219
that are constantly trying to figure out
well how much is nature and then add on

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229
well how much is nature and then add on
 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:43.990
well how much is nature and then add on
to the nurture you know is it 60-percent

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000
to the nurture you know is it 60-percent
 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.940
to the nurture you know is it 60-percent
nature and 40% nurture depending on what

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950
nature and 40% nurture depending on what
 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.010
nature and 40% nurture depending on what
trait you're talking about well it turns

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020
trait you're talking about well it turns
 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.320
trait you're talking about well it turns
out that genes don't work that way genes

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330
out that genes don't work that way genes
 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.300
out that genes don't work that way genes
don't get you part of the way they're

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310
don't get you part of the way they're
 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.700
don't get you part of the way they're
you know to the point you're born or the

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710
you know to the point you're born or the
 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.320
you know to the point you're born or the
point shortly after that or before that

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330
point shortly after that or before that
 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.750
point shortly after that or before that
genes are always interacting with the

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760
genes are always interacting with the
 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.880
genes are always interacting with the
environment so the new way to think

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890
environment so the new way to think
 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.430
environment so the new way to think
about this is that it's not nature plus

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440
about this is that it's not nature plus
 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.080
about this is that it's not nature plus
nurture or nascent nature versus nurture

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090
nurture or nascent nature versus nurture
 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.960
nurture or nascent nature versus nurture
if anything its nature interacting with

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970
if anything its nature interacting with
 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.400
if anything its nature interacting with
nurture if you have to use those words

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410
nurture if you have to use those words
 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.230
nurture if you have to use those words
so one of the phrases that scientists

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240
so one of the phrases that scientists
 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.290
so one of the phrases that scientists
are using now is G times e that is

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300
are using now is G times e that is
 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.040
are using now is G times e that is
genetics times environment as opposed to

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050
genetics times environment as opposed to
 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.890
genetics times environment as opposed to
G + E ISM that they call it an additive

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900
G + E ISM that they call it an additive
 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.960
G + E ISM that they call it an additive
model the additive model as well you

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970
model the additive model as well you
 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.730
model the additive model as well you
have so much inborn intelligence and

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740
have so much inborn intelligence and
 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.350
have so much inborn intelligence and
then plus what you get in the

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360
then plus what you get in the
 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.670
then plus what you get in the
environment that would be you know the

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680
environment that would be you know the
 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.590
environment that would be you know the
nature of plus nurture the new the new

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600
nature of plus nurture the new the new
 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.500
nature of plus nurture the new the new
model is you can't separate them you

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510
model is you can't separate them you
 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.780
model is you can't separate them you
just absolutely cannot separate the

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790
just absolutely cannot separate the
 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.780
just absolutely cannot separate the
effects of genes from the effects of the

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790
effects of genes from the effects of the
 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.700
effects of genes from the effects of the
environment so all we can do of course

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710
environment so all we can do of course
 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.150
environment so all we can do of course
is to identify the resources that we

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160
is to identify the resources that we
 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.890
is to identify the resources that we
have in our environments and and

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900
have in our environments and and
 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.710
have in our environments and and
maximize them as best as best we can

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720
 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.190
one of the studies is goes back to 1957

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200
one of the studies is goes back to 1957
 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.830
one of the studies is goes back to 1957
or 58 where these two guys were looking

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840
or 58 where these two guys were looking
 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.250
or 58 where these two guys were looking
at at rats that had been genetically

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260
at at rats that had been genetically
 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.700
at at rats that had been genetically
designed the genetically bred that is to

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710
designed the genetically bred that is to
 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.480
designed the genetically bred that is to
be intelligent and in generation after

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490
be intelligent and in generation after
 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.890
be intelligent and in generation after
intelligent they were incredibly

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900
intelligent they were incredibly
 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.110
intelligent they were incredibly
intelligent in you know is seen in mazes

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120
intelligent in you know is seen in mazes
 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.690
intelligent in you know is seen in mazes
and things like that so then they wanted

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700
and things like that so then they wanted
 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.400
and things like that so then they wanted
to see well what if you subject them to

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410
to see well what if you subject them to
 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.080
to see well what if you subject them to
different environments extreme

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090
different environments extreme
 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.660
different environments extreme
environments like sensory deprivation

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670
environments like sensory deprivation
 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.020
environments like sensory deprivation
kind of thing or extra treats and you

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030
kind of thing or extra treats and you
 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.610
kind of thing or extra treats and you
know so-called intellectual stimulation

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620
know so-called intellectual stimulation
 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.910
know so-called intellectual stimulation
for rats if you can imagine what that is

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920
for rats if you can imagine what that is
 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.270
for rats if you can imagine what that is
it basically it's lots of toys and

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280
it basically it's lots of toys and
 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.010
it basically it's lots of toys and
different textures and sounds and sights

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020
different textures and sounds and sights
 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.560
different textures and sounds and sights
and colors and things like that and they

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570
and colors and things like that and they
 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.660
and colors and things like that and they
wanted to see well what's the additive

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670
wanted to see well what's the additive
 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.030
wanted to see well what's the additive
difference of the environment if you

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040
difference of the environment if you
 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.520
difference of the environment if you
take these these these mice that have

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530
take these these these mice that have
 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.770
take these these these mice that have
been bred to be smart compared to these

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780
been bred to be smart compared to these
 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.780
been bred to be smart compared to these
mice that have been bred to be not so

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790
mice that have been bred to be not so
 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.210
mice that have been bred to be not so
smart well turns out that when you

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220
smart well turns out that when you
 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.830
smart well turns out that when you
subject them to these different

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840
subject them to these different
 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.810
subject them to these different
environments actually the mice that are

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820
environments actually the mice that are
 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.510
environments actually the mice that are

that you're getting these interactions

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040
that you're getting these interactions
 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.310

were looking at the old additive model
 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.979
were looking at the old additive model
of G + E so so that was one of the very

of G + E so so that was one of the very
 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.479
of G + E so so that was one of the very
early clues that we're looking at a

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489
early clues that we're looking at a
 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.760
early clues that we're looking at a
whole new model of genes and environment

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.770
whole new model of genes and environment
 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:28.260
whole new model of genes and environment
that it was this interactive model

the world's foremost authority on
autistic savants and this is a really

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250
autistic savants and this is a really
 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.460
autistic savants and this is a really
interesting idea we look at savants you

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470
interesting idea we look at savants you
 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:39.990
interesting idea we look at savants you
know Rain Man and things like that and

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000
know Rain Man and things like that and
 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.029
know Rain Man and things like that and
we think oh well that's obvious

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039
we think oh well that's obvious
 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:45.689
we think oh well that's obvious
obviously evidence of innate gifts

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699
obviously evidence of innate gifts
 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:47.999
obviously evidence of innate gifts
because these guys are obviously born

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:48.009
because these guys are obviously born
 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:50.279
because these guys are obviously born
with different sorts of brains and it's

with different sorts of brains and it's
 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:52.860
with different sorts of brains and it's
and it's these they're born with these

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870
and it's these they're born with these
 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.629
and it's these they're born with these
these gifts that are able to you know

well when you actually look at what's

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080
well when you actually look at what's
 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.439
well when you actually look at what's
going on yes these people are born with

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:04.449
going on yes these people are born with
 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:07.020

question about that but it turns out
 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.249
question about that but it turns out
that the the actual skills that they

that the the actual skills that they
 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:19.560
that the the actual skills that they
acquire then come after that and that we

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570
acquire then come after that and that we
 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.839
acquire then come after that and that we
can actually manipulate our own brains I

it actually works in the short term you

00:07:26.549 --> 00:07:26.559
it actually works in the short term you
 

00:07:26.559 --> 00:07:28.649
it actually works in the short term you
can get a child to be really really good

00:07:28.649 --> 00:07:28.659
can get a child to be really really good
 

00:07:28.659 --> 00:07:30.149
can get a child to be really really good
and really really motivated by saying

learning and then you combine that with
 

00:08:19.389 --> 00:08:22.290

in a relatively average level in some
 

00:10:02.639 --> 00:10:04.240
in a relatively average level in some
way and then you see some other kid just

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:04.250
way and then you see some other kid just
 

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:06.619
way and then you see some other kid just
doing something amazing you're you're

example when you look at Mozart yes he

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:12.120
example when you look at Mozart yes he
 

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.449

he was five six years old but his

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:18.500
he was five six years old but his
 

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.079
he was five six years old but his
performances then were not could not be

00:10:21.079 --> 00:10:21.089
performances then were not could not be
 

00:10:21.089 --> 00:10:23.629

compared to a great violinist of twenty

00:10:23.629 --> 00:10:23.639
compared to a great violinist of twenty
 

00:10:23.639 --> 00:10:25.249
compared to a great violinist of twenty
five or thirty years old he couldn't be

00:10:25.249 --> 00:10:25.259
five or thirty years old he couldn't be
 

00:10:25.259 --> 00:10:26.629
five or thirty years old he couldn't be
then and it certainly couldn't be now

00:10:26.629 --> 00:10:26.639
then and it certainly couldn't be now
 

00:10:26.639 --> 00:10:29.059
then and it certainly couldn't be now
another point to make is that with the

00:10:29.059 --> 00:10:29.069
another point to make is that with the
 

00:10:29.069 --> 00:10:30.889
another point to make is that with the
Suzuki method and other methods now

00:10:30.889 --> 00:10:30.899
Suzuki method and other methods now
 

00:10:30.899 --> 00:10:33.410
Suzuki method and other methods now
there are many many many performers now

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:33.420
there are many many many performers now
 

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.650
there are many many many performers now
who are performing at that age five to

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:36.660
who are performing at that age five to
 

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:40.220
who are performing at that age five to
six years old seven years old as good or

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:40.230
six years old seven years old as good or
 

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:42.170
six years old seven years old as good or
better than what Mozart did when he was

better than what Mozart did when he was
 

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:44.569
better than what Mozart did when he was
a kid so we tend to think of we tend to

a kid so we tend to think of we tend to
 

00:10:44.579 --> 00:10:46.309
a kid so we tend to think of we tend to
hold Mozart up on this pedestal as being

00:10:46.309 --> 00:10:46.319
hold Mozart up on this pedestal as being
 

00:10:46.319 --> 00:10:48.139
hold Mozart up on this pedestal as being

being one in a zillion in terms of his
 

00:10:50.459 --> 00:10:55.509
being one in a zillion in terms of his
early musicality but but in actuality

00:10:55.509 --> 00:10:55.519
early musicality but but in actuality
 

00:10:55.519 --> 00:10:58.460
early musicality but but in actuality
it's fairly easy if you look at his life

00:10:58.460 --> 00:10:58.470
it's fairly easy if you look at his life
 

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:02.540
it's fairly easy if you look at his life
to explain where he where he got the

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:02.550
to explain where he where he got the
 

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:04.249
to explain where he where he got the
skills that he got and to identify them

00:11:04.249 --> 00:11:04.259
skills that he got and to identify them
 

00:11:04.259 --> 00:11:06.259
skills that he got and to identify them
as skills not as some sort of

00:11:06.259 --> 00:11:06.269
as skills not as some sort of
 

00:11:06.269 --> 00:11:09.740
as skills not as some sort of
supernatural power and to see that now

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:09.750
supernatural power and to see that now
 

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:12.650
supernatural power and to see that now
we are culture has actually learned a

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:12.660
we are culture has actually learned a
 

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:14.389
we are culture has actually learned a
lot of the trade secrets that at the

00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:14.399
lot of the trade secrets that at the
 

00:11:14.399 --> 00:11:16.720
lot of the trade secrets that at the
time maybe only Leopold Mozart knew and

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:16.730
time maybe only Leopold Mozart knew and

early as possible that's that's a
 

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:46.940
early as possible that's that's a
wonderful thing in it leads it to all

the mistake that's that's been made

the mistake that's that's been made
 

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:31.300
the mistake that's that's been made
in IQ tests is that because some tests

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:31.310
in IQ tests is that because some tests
 

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:34.900
in IQ tests is that because some tests

are that the people who score that at

are that the people who score that at
 

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:47.770
are that the people who score that at
that level are gonna score roughly at

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:47.780
that level are gonna score roughly at
 

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:52.360
that level are gonna score roughly at
that level when they're 15 18 20 because

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:52.370
that level when they're 15 18 20 because
 

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:54.310
that level when they're 15 18 20 because
that stability is there we're

heads and we apply that just
philosophically to this idea of what can

look at how they became great it's not
 

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:18.380
look at how they became great it's not
that they just suddenly were great or

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:18.390
that they just suddenly were great or
 

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:20.150

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:43.920
 

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:45.410
I've always been interested in this

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:45.420
I've always been interested in this
 

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:47.180
I've always been interested in this
question of what's the difference

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:47.190
question of what's the difference
 

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:49.520

between people who are mediocre at
 

00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:50.570
between people who are mediocre at
something and the people who are great

something and the people who are great
 

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:53.690
something and the people who are great
at something and and I think a lot of us

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:53.700
at something and and I think a lot of us
 

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:56.330
at something and and I think a lot of us
are and it's my good fortune as a writer

so I read a lot of science and I try to

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:02.340
so I read a lot of science and I try to
 

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:05.390
so I read a lot of science and I try to
be the guy who's gonna explain a

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:05.400
be the guy who's gonna explain a
 

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:09.890
be the guy who's gonna explain a
scientific concept to to the general

scientific concept to to the general
public so that's just what I do and a

00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:13.920
public so that's just what I do and a
 

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:17.480
