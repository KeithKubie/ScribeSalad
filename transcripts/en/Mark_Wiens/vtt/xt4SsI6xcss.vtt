00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.080
- Good morning, I hope
you're having an amazing day.

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:02.913
It's Mark Wiens.

00:00:02.913 --> 00:00:05.500
I'm in Kota Bharu in the
Kelantan State of Malaysia.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.750
This is a state that's known
for their culture, their art,

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.460
and especially Kelantanese unique food

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.890
which is incredibly delicious.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.610
Today we are gonna go on a
Kelantanese Malay food tour.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.584
We're gonna eat some of the
iconic dishes of Kelantan.

00:00:19.584 --> 00:00:22.938
We're gonna start with what
is one of the most iconic,

00:00:22.938 --> 00:00:25.080
one of the most well-known dishes,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.127
especially for breakfast in Kelantan.

00:00:28.127 --> 00:00:30.710
(upbeat music)

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.570
We just arrived to the first restaurant.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.600
This place is called Nasi Kerabu Panji

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.620
and they serve nasi kerabu

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.100
which is one of the most popular dishes

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.423
especially it's known as a
breakfast dish in Kelantan.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.210
You can see the smoke just
pouring from the grill,

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.690
the meaty aroma.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.200
They have a line up here.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.630
You choose what you want
on top of your rice.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.160
And yeah.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.993
Nasi kerabu,

00:00:56.993 --> 00:00:59.834
this is one of the greatest
dishes from Kelantan.

00:00:59.834 --> 00:01:03.501
(speaking foreign language)

00:01:04.467 --> 00:01:05.300
- You want?

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.146
(speaking foreign language)

00:01:07.146 --> 00:01:07.979
- Yes, please.

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:08.869
Yes, please.

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.452
(upbeat music)

00:01:15.647 --> 00:01:16.660
And I think it's also

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.950
one of the most beautiful
dishes in Malaysia

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.270
and maybe in the world.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.480
Nasi means rice, kerabu means salad.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.583
And so it's always rice salad.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.750
One of the common
versions is the blue rice

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.293
which is colored with
butterfly pea flowers.

00:01:31.293 --> 00:01:32.890
But they also have yellow rice.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.080
They have just white rice.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.800
They have other versions of rice.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.389
And then I chose a fish which is called,

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:41.370
which is called ikan percik

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:42.360
which is like,

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.780
it's like a coconut milk
barbecue sauce to go with it.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.760
I've had nasi kerabu a
couple times in Malaysia

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.940
but this is my first time in Kelantan.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.610
So I am overjoyed and can
hardly contain my excitement.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:55.443
Let's begin.

00:01:55.443 --> 00:01:58.350
And then Joel got a plate
with the kambing bakar

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.770
which is grilled.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.620
He said lamb but I believe it's goat.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.943
Or it could be lamb.

00:02:03.943 --> 00:02:05.320
First mix in with the rice and salad.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.400
You could see how vibrant
that color, the rice is.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.086
Let's just taste the
rice and the salad first

00:02:11.086 --> 00:02:13.940
because that is what nasi kerabu is

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.821
and then after that move
in for other things.

00:02:16.821 --> 00:02:19.967
(upbeat music)

00:02:19.967 --> 00:02:21.800
- [Mark and Joel] Mmm!

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.010
(laughing)

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.287
- Oh, that is superb.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.332
It's so herbaceous, refreshing.

00:02:33.332 --> 00:02:34.800
- Yeah.
- What herb is that?

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.950
Maybe, possibly Vietnamese coriander.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.240
You taste a little bit of fishiness.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.190
The coconut, the coconut in there

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.710
just also magnifies the flavor.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.110
I'm gonna squeeze on the lime,

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.660
mix that around again.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.330
Okay, I'll go in for that chili.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.770
That's minced fish I
believe plus grated coconut.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.150
Oh yeah, as soon as you break into that

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.010
you can see the texture.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.010
There's so much grated coconut in there.

00:02:59.156 --> 00:02:59.998
(Joel laughing)

00:02:59.998 --> 00:03:01.700
- That's a bite, man.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.930
- Yeah.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.010
You can not only taste the coconut

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.840
but you can feel the grated coconut.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.070
Oh and that sour squeeze of lime

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.500
that also enhances everything.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.910
Scoop out the salted egg.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.900
For the fish, I believe
it's like a mackerel.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.740
Take off a piece of the side of the fish.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.572
That coconut milk, it's
like a barbecue sauce,

00:03:21.572 --> 00:03:23.176
under the rice salad.

00:03:23.176 --> 00:03:25.759
(upbeat music)

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:27.812
Mmm!

00:03:30.857 --> 00:03:33.650
Oh, that fish is incredibly smoky!

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.000
And then it's rich from the coconut cream.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.970
Oh, I wasn't expecting
the fish to be that smoky.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:38.882
You gotta taste the fish.

00:03:38.882 --> 00:03:42.290
- And I just tried the first bite of meat,

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.123
probably it's goat.

00:03:43.123 --> 00:03:44.320
And I had the same reaction.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.730
It's unbelievably smoky.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.016
Let's taste each other's.

00:03:48.016 --> 00:03:51.170
(upbeat music)

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.310
Yeah.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.117
That tastes like honey barbecue sauce.

00:03:54.117 --> 00:03:54.950
The goat is great

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.050
but I think I really
love the fish the best.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.810
That's such a smoky flavor

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:59.920
and that barbecue sauce,

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.630
that coconut milk
barbecue sauce is so rich.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:03.830
Stick this in the middle of my rice.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.216
And what I saw one of the guys do

00:04:05.216 --> 00:04:07.440
who was eating across the table from us,

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.320
is he takes the cracker and
just crunches it on top.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.540
So you add another dimension of texture.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.583
This just might be a pro tip, pro move.

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:20.473
I do wanna get some of that
pickled garlic in there too.

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:23.400
Or maybe, I don't know
if I can break this.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.310
I might just have to bite into it.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.840
Okay, but we'll save that for next.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.583
Get a little bit of that
salted egg going in there.

00:04:27.583 --> 00:04:30.166
(upbeat music)

00:04:34.645 --> 00:04:35.740
Solid mix of flavors.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.780
The smoky fish, the sambal, the salad,

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:39.613
the herbaceousness.

00:04:39.613 --> 00:04:41.263
I'm gonna try that pickled garlic.

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.962
Mmm!

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.913
Ooh!

00:04:46.913 --> 00:04:47.746
That's wonderful though.

00:04:47.746 --> 00:04:50.883
That's like another blast of
flavor early in the morning.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.679
Washing that down with some teh tarik.

00:04:53.679 --> 00:04:56.750
(upbeat music)

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.450
And there's one more thing
that we gotta try here.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:59.730
I'm not sure if I can remember the name.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.660
I think it's called nasi tumpang.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:02.880
But it's like a cone-shaped,

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.710
a very long cone-shaped,

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.330
there's rice in here with different layers

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.163
wrapped into a banana leaf.

00:05:07.163 --> 00:05:09.037
Look at the size of this stuff.

00:05:09.037 --> 00:05:12.551
It's like a parking cone.
- It can stand on its own.

00:05:12.551 --> 00:05:13.836
- You could use this as a parking cone.

00:05:13.836 --> 00:05:15.230
(Joel laughing)

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.630
Okay, we're gonna unwrap, take this out.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.160
Oh no, I think I messed up a layer.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.360
Oh, we lost the top hat.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.410
Okay, I'm just gonna.

00:05:25.489 --> 00:05:26.322
Look at how beautiful.

00:05:26.322 --> 00:05:27.692
Okay, I cheated a little bit.

00:05:27.692 --> 00:05:29.193
Put it back together.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.290
Oh, that is beautiful.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.330
An entire cone of rice.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:35.790
You can even see a shrimp in there.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.070
You can definitely see the grains of rice

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.520
but mushed together at the bottom.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.330
I can see egg like an omelet

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.270
and a shrimp in there,
in that mid section.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.180
Then more rice, then some shredded meat.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.013
And then the rice

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:49.700
gets more and more
condensed and compressed

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.500
as you go to the top of it.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.340
I think I'm just gonna go
straight in for the center there.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.340
Get some of the rice.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.030
Gonna try this.

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.770
Oh yeah, that is like
an omelet and shrimp.

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.603
This is like a tiny little--
- Look at the construction.

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:04.630
- [Mark] I got some of the omelet I think

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.163
and a shrimp in that bite.

00:06:08.897 --> 00:06:10.730
- [Mark And Joel] Mmm.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.800
- Peppers, did you get any peppers?

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.080
I got a whole--
- Maybe that was in yours.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.030
Mmm, I taste coriander seed though.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.511
- Okay.

00:06:19.511 --> 00:06:21.180
- I taste coriander seed.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.470
I don't think it's glutinous rice though.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.370
It's like regular rice just compressed.

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:25.970
It's kinda just like a takeaway,

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:31.403
natural takeaway, all in
one little cone packet.

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.390
That was an incredible
way to begin this day.

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:42.060
This Kelantanese food tour in Kota Bharu.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.080
Nasi kerabu, it's such a beautiful dish.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.193
It's so incredibly delicious.

00:06:47.095 --> 00:06:49.760
And the next place is one
that really specializes,

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.460
is known for their kambing bakar,

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.997
which is the grilled goat, nasi kerabu.

00:06:54.997 --> 00:06:56.100
Yes.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.220
So breakfast number two.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.295
What a dish, dude.

00:06:58.295 --> 00:06:59.588
- I couldn't believe it.

00:06:59.588 --> 00:07:02.700
The texture lover's dream, really.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.937
I got some remnants on the lens here.

00:07:04.937 --> 00:07:06.930
- Kerabu, some salad in the lens.

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:08.707
We've got some rice salad in the lens.

00:07:08.707 --> 00:07:09.540
(Joel laughing)

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.697
Okay the next place is called
Jijah's, Jijah's Nasi Kerabu.

00:07:12.697 --> 00:07:15.280
(upbeat music)

00:07:22.572 --> 00:07:24.380
Something that's amazing about Kota Bharu

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.330
is that it does have a
central downtown area

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.240
that's a real city

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.620
but then as soon as you
get off the main roads

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:32.690
it's so quiet.

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:35.270
You go right immediately
into the countryside.

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:36.103
It's still the city

00:07:36.103 --> 00:07:37.640
but it's really spread out.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.550
People have rice fields,

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.170
there's cows, there's coconut trees.

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:43.310
It's just a fruit tropical paradise.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:44.701
Right now we're pretty close to the ocean.

00:07:44.701 --> 00:07:49.650
But this restaurant is
right in the neighborhood.

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:51.600
What a relaxing calming setting.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.910
Again, you can see the smoke
pouring out of the chimney

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:55.080
from the grilling meat.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.196
We're here again to eat nasi kerabu.

00:07:57.196 --> 00:07:58.029
Nasi kerabu.

00:07:58.029 --> 00:08:00.100
(speaking foreign language)

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.100
They're so friendly.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.997
All the entire family is welcoming us.

00:08:04.997 --> 00:08:08.160
The key things here is that
they serve usually yellow rice

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.306
which is flavored with turmeric
or colored with turmeric.

00:08:11.306 --> 00:08:13.326
(loud pounding)

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:15.909
(upbeat music)

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.667
Thank you.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

00:08:28.436 --> 00:08:31.020
- There's a very strong
and almost mandatory reason

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.700
why you should try multiple
plates of nasi kerabu

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:34.640
because they're so different,

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:35.690
and this one is totally different

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:37.610
from the last version that we tried.

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:39.600
Starting with the rice
which is yellow rice

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.400
which I believe is colored with turmeric.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.430
It's just a very very light
almost transparent yellow.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:46.710
Then they put on the salad

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:49.530
which I believe is mostly
Vietnamese coriander

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:51.710
or rau ram or laksa leaf.

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:54.020
They add on the budu sauce
which is the fermented,

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.030
I forgot to also mention

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:56.820
that that's also a necessary component

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:01.390
of nasi kerabu is the budu,
the fermented anchovy sauce.

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:04.840
And then their specialty
here is the kambing bakar

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.953
which is the grilled goat meat.

00:09:05.953 --> 00:09:07.121
Nasi kerabu number two.

00:09:07.121 --> 00:09:07.980
You're ready?

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.516
- Yes, I'm excited.

00:09:09.516 --> 00:09:12.099
(upbeat music)

00:09:13.525 --> 00:09:16.487
(Joel laughing)

00:09:16.487 --> 00:09:17.320
Oh.

00:09:18.326 --> 00:09:19.780
- [Mark] That one you can really taste

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.970
the Vietnamese coriander herb

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:23.799
in there.
- Creamy.

00:09:23.799 --> 00:09:26.443
- That's rich, really coconutty.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:32.040
It's sweet but the sweetness
does complement everything.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.910
Okay, we've gotta move in for that meat.

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:35.005
You can see there's bones still on it.

00:09:35.005 --> 00:09:36.706
This meat looks incredible.

00:09:36.706 --> 00:09:38.430
Perfectly grilled.

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:39.973
It's so aromatic.

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.053
And it feels tender in your fingers.

00:09:43.053 --> 00:09:45.636
(upbeat music)

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.094
Oh, wow.

00:09:49.094 --> 00:09:50.810
(laughing)

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:53.880
It is sweet but you taste
the caramelized smokiness.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.320
There's like cumin in there, lemongrass,

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.028
maybe even coconut milk.

00:09:58.028 --> 00:09:59.810
What an amazing range of flavor.

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:00.880
I'm gonna get everything in one.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.760
Again scoop out the salted egg.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.790
Oh, that just slid out this time.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:06.610
I'm gonna mix in with the meat

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:07.830
with the salad and rice,

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.973
all in one massive bite of nasi kerabu.

00:10:12.617 --> 00:10:13.791
(laughing)

00:10:13.791 --> 00:10:15.290
That's a size, oh I lost some,

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:17.520
sizeable bite of nasi kerabu.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:18.857
At the tips of my fingers.

00:10:18.857 --> 00:10:21.440
(upbeat music)

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:23.413
Oh, yep.

00:10:23.413 --> 00:10:24.442
I got a bone.

00:10:24.442 --> 00:10:27.265
(upbeat music)

00:10:27.265 --> 00:10:30.425
Everything together with
that creamy salted egg,

00:10:30.425 --> 00:10:33.540
the herbs, the coconut cream,

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:37.190
the coconut cream curry
and the shredded coconut,

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:38.710
and the meat.

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:41.710
What a bite to remember forever.

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:43.520
- [Joel] Don't explode everywhere.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.350
- Another thing that's
very common to do is take,

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:46.207
I think they're fish crackers

00:10:46.207 --> 00:10:47.420
and just crunch them up

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:51.650
and eat this all together as well, mix in,

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:52.483
and after this bite

00:10:52.483 --> 00:10:54.230
I will go in for the chili with the fish

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:55.900
and grated coconut, more coconut.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:57.936
I really love this
component of nasi kerabu,

00:10:57.936 --> 00:11:00.900
the chili stuffed with fish and coconut.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:05.900
It's really an amazing, fruity,
tropical coconutty delight.

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:09.710
The crackers just sort of
disintegrate into the rice

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:10.543
and the sambal.

00:11:13.046 --> 00:11:13.879
Mmm.

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.399
You can eat the stem and all.

00:11:17.399 --> 00:11:18.232
Oh.

00:11:18.232 --> 00:11:20.380
(laughing)

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:21.572
I want a whole plate of those.

00:11:21.572 --> 00:11:24.155
(upbeat music)

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:27.963
Wow.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.040
That was just spectacular.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.520
And again you can just
kinda fold over your paper

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.400
when you are finished, completed.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:39.233
And then for dessert,

00:11:39.233 --> 00:11:42.330
Ying got this little
banana leaf wrapped packet.

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:43.910
Not sure exactly what it is.

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:44.930
Oh, there's a whole bunch

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:46.430
of shredded coconut in there, yeah?

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:48.940
It feels like glutinous
rice on the bottom.

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.370
Oh, there's three layers.

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:52.690
Whoa, that's beautiful.

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:53.764
Again, the triple layering.

00:11:53.764 --> 00:11:55.360
The glutinous rice,

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.380
looks like beans in the center,

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:58.630
and then shredded coconut.

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:00.290
Not actually totally sure what this is

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:01.470
but I think I'm gonna just try

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:02.550
to get a little bit of everything.

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:03.560
It's very very sticky.

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:04.393
Whoa.

00:12:04.393 --> 00:12:06.890
Maybe either sugar or honey.

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:09.690
Some of the beans and
then some of the coconut.

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:11.721
It really just completely
sticks to your fingers too.

00:12:11.721 --> 00:12:14.304
(upbeat music)

00:12:15.471 --> 00:12:16.304
- Mmm!

00:12:16.304 --> 00:12:17.137
Mmm!

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.660
Beans!

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:20.493
- Yup.

00:12:20.493 --> 00:12:22.680
That's beans on the inside.
- Mmm!

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.420
- That's just pure shredded coconut.

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:25.780
And you've got three different textures,

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:26.613
whole different textures.

00:12:26.613 --> 00:12:31.613
The glutinous sticky
rice, the creamy beans,

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:35.050
the crunchy but light yet fluffy coconut.

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:38.960
It was incredibly amazing and
just talking with the family,

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.340
the owner, it's still family-owned.

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:42.571
They're so nice.

00:12:42.571 --> 00:12:45.000
They're so friendly.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.351
It's an amazing amazing place.

00:12:48.351 --> 00:12:52.018
(speaking foreign language)

00:12:53.578 --> 00:12:55.428
(upbeat music)

00:12:55.428 --> 00:12:58.470
(speaking foreign language)

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:00.320
What an incredible family.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.910
They were so nice, so
friendly, so welcoming.

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:07.410
That was the true display
of Kelantanese culture.

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:10.480
And just blown away by
that incredible food,

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.020
the nasi kerabu.

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:13.890
That was unbelievably delicious.

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:16.560
From here, we are driving back
into the center of Kota Bharu

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:21.410
and there is what is one of
the most beautiful markets.

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:23.170
One of the main,

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:25.300
it's the main local market of Kota Bharu,

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.610
known for their local food and everything.

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:28.443
So we're gonna go check it out.

00:13:28.443 --> 00:13:29.341
We're gonna eat some more food there.

00:13:29.341 --> 00:13:31.160
We are on our way

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.010
and I can't wait to explore the market.

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:35.593
(upbeat music)

00:13:40.158 --> 00:13:41.630
We made it to the market.

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:45.610
This is an amazing painting
mural representing Kelantan.

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:48.520
Stink beans, one of my
personal favorite ingredients,

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.460
budu which is the fermented
anchovy fish sauce,

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:51.360
there's chilies.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.220
Three beautifully powerful,
delicious ingredients

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:56.890
that just represent Kelantan.

00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:58.070
This market is called,

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:01.040
officially I believe Siti Khadija Market.

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.110
And you walk around, there's
vegetables, there's fruits.

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:04.290
There's everything you could possibly,

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:07.350
all the ingredients
you could possibly need

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:09.195
to make Kelantanese food.

00:14:09.195 --> 00:14:10.990
But then you come into the center

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:13.469
and this is the iconic center.

00:14:13.469 --> 00:14:15.310
It's a big, not really,

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:17.360
sort of a dome with
natural light coming in.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:20.050
How many sides are there to this, octagon?

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:21.980
Well more than an octagon maybe.

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:24.520
But every side is painted
a different color.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.910
I believe that you can also
get some cooked food here too

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:28.990
which we'll try to find as well.

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:30.020
Tempoyak, oh yeah.

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:32.450
Okay, I just located two
of my favorite ingredients,

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:36.544
pickled stink beans and
tempoyak, fermented durian.

00:14:36.544 --> 00:14:39.127
(upbeat music)

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:44.100
Ying immediately spotted some mushrooms.

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:45.270
This is a mushroom

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:47.910
that's common throughout
the Malay Peninsula

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:48.743
which are dried,

00:14:48.743 --> 00:14:49.653
which is really good in a curry

00:14:49.653 --> 00:14:51.237
that we're gonna bring back home.

00:14:51.237 --> 00:14:54.055
(upbeat music)

00:14:54.055 --> 00:14:56.840
Okay, moving up to the next level.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.160
And I think this is
where the food court is

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.620
and then you can also get a view

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:02.700
over the entire market as well.

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.237
Step upstairs and immediately

00:15:04.237 --> 00:15:07.578
you're greeted by a bunch of curry stalls.

00:15:07.578 --> 00:15:10.960
The aromas, the spices,
the curry paste, the fish.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.227
In Bangkok, yes!

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:15.460
(laughing)

00:15:16.299 --> 00:15:19.966
(speaking foreign language)

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.857
On the tablet, they're
watching one of our videos.

00:15:23.857 --> 00:15:26.660
So we stopped to get some laksam here

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:27.960
and he also has laksam and laksa.

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.340
But in here it's the same thing,

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:30.340
just the noodles are different

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:34.169
and the laksam has more of
a wide noodle that he uses.

00:15:34.169 --> 00:15:36.752
(upbeat music)

00:15:43.254 --> 00:15:44.530
(speaking foreign language)

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:47.836
Oh, so it's the different noodles.

00:15:47.836 --> 00:15:49.618
Laksa and laksam.
- Yes.

00:15:49.618 --> 00:15:51.135
This laksam, this laksa.

00:15:51.135 --> 00:15:52.753
- Ah, so it's the noodle size.
- Yes.

00:15:52.753 --> 00:15:53.904
- Ah, okay.

00:15:53.904 --> 00:15:55.890
(speaking foreign language)

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:58.590
Okay, I got my bowl of laksam.

00:15:58.590 --> 00:15:59.823
I'm gonna sit here.

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:02.884
Everyone is so friendly.

00:16:02.884 --> 00:16:05.791
(laughing)

00:16:05.791 --> 00:16:06.840
Hello.

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.190
You can see the laksam.

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:10.610
It's coconut milk-based gravy.

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:11.910
There's a lot of herbs in here.

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:12.890
Again, there's bean sprouts.

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:16.430
I believe there's the rau
ram, the Vietnamese coriander.

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:18.340
And these are the noodles,
the laksam noodles.

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:20.460
It's like a thick noodle
roll which they cut,

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:22.098
which they slice into a roll up.

00:16:22.098 --> 00:16:24.003
That's a full noodle roll.

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:29.400
Mmm!

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.233
Mmm!

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:32.290
Oh, wow.

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:36.220
Again, it's all about the herbs.

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:38.430
The coriander, the bean sprouts.

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:39.440
And then those noodles.

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.380
It's like so thick that it's almost like,

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.250
it almost tastes like compressed rice.

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:44.800
But they are very smooth.

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.370
They go down really really easily.

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:47.880
The next step now that I've tasted it

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:49.120
is to add some of the sambal.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.457
This is some of the
shrimp paste with chilies.

00:16:51.457 --> 00:16:52.480
Sambal belacan.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.970
Okay.

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:55.420
This is the shrimp paste sambal.

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:56.253
Perfect.

00:16:56.253 --> 00:16:57.210
I'll stick with that for now.

00:16:57.210 --> 00:16:58.883
Mix it in with that coconut milk.

00:17:03.325 --> 00:17:04.158
Mmm!

00:17:04.158 --> 00:17:05.020
Mmm!

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:06.886
But the coconut curry itself is very mild.

00:17:06.886 --> 00:17:07.940
It's not spicy.

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:09.150
But then you do add that sambal

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:11.240
which, that's delicious.

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.540
And those noodles, the laksam noodles

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.431
they sort of disintegrate in your mouth.

00:17:14.431 --> 00:17:16.010
I'm just gonna drizzle on

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:17.952
one more spoon of the sambal, oh yeah.

00:17:17.952 --> 00:17:20.535
(upbeat music)

00:17:21.809 --> 00:17:22.766
Mmm!

00:17:22.766 --> 00:17:24.297
Mmm!

00:17:24.297 --> 00:17:25.130
Mmm!

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:29.810
Spicy, but that Vietnamese
coriander, that's the highlight.

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:30.643
The laksa leaf.

00:17:30.643 --> 00:17:33.940
It just provides such a
vibrancy and an herbal taste

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:34.900
to the entire dish.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:35.987
Very good.

00:17:35.987 --> 00:17:40.090
(speaking foreign language)

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:41.350
- These guys are cheering

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:44.293
as Mark douses the sambal on his dish.

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:46.873
It's such an awesome situation here.

00:17:46.873 --> 00:17:48.840
- It's such a cool situation.

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:49.940
Such an amazing place.

00:17:51.887 --> 00:17:52.720
Mmm, mmm!

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.260
Oh, and by the way.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:59.023
One more fact, unique
fact, interesting fact.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:01.852
Kelantan is known to use,

00:18:01.852 --> 00:18:05.470
they use coconut milk, they
use coconut all over Malaysia.

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:08.370
But in Kelantan, Kelantanese Malay cuisine

00:18:09.327 --> 00:18:11.450
is known to use the most coconut milk

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:13.113
and the most coconut in their cuisine

00:18:13.113 --> 00:18:15.070
out of all of Malaysia.

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:18.408
So get ready to eat some coconut
which is a very good thing

00:18:18.408 --> 00:18:20.347
when you visit Kelantan.

00:18:20.347 --> 00:18:22.530
(speaking foreign language)

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:26.310
And again, what made it even
better than just the good food,

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:28.303
is the people and the friendliness.

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:30.540
As we were going up the stairs

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:31.600
I saw a lady who was selling

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.750
all sorts of different
Kelantanese desserts.

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:37.070
There's a couple of very well
known desserts I wanna try.

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:38.120
Hello!

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.265
I think that's the one right there.

00:18:39.265 --> 00:18:40.098
Akok?
- Yes.

00:18:40.098 --> 00:18:40.931
- [Mark] Akok.

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:43.306
Oh, this one.

00:18:43.306 --> 00:18:44.220
- [Vendor] Tahi itik.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.097
You call tahi itik.

00:18:45.097 --> 00:18:45.930
- Tahi itik.
- Yes.

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:46.888
- [Mark] Okay.

00:18:46.888 --> 00:18:48.829
- [Vendor] Tahi itik, jala mas.

00:18:48.829 --> 00:18:49.802
- [Mark] Jala mas.

00:18:49.802 --> 00:18:51.074
Alright.

00:18:51.074 --> 00:18:52.162
- [Vendor] Okay, three only?

00:18:52.162 --> 00:18:54.910
- I have three different things, okay.

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:56.840
One of the main Kelantanese desserts

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:58.410
that I wanted to try is called akok.

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:00.790
When you pick it up it's kinda like,

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:03.280
kinda floppy and kind of,

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.750
you can't tell if it's egg

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:06.000
but you can also almost feel

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.230
that it's kinda juicy at the same time.

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:10.890
I'm not totally sure, I know
there's coconut milk in it.

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:11.810
You're not totally sure

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:13.600
what to expect before you take a bite.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:14.749
So I'm gonna take a bite.

00:19:14.749 --> 00:19:17.332
(upbeat music)

00:19:20.505 --> 00:19:21.463
It's like custardy.

00:19:21.463 --> 00:19:22.733
- Yeah, very soft.

00:19:22.733 --> 00:19:25.360
- Wow, it's like a solid custard almost.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.040
There's not like a bready body to it.

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:29.600
It's like an egg coconut custard I think.

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:30.585
I think that's what it is

00:19:30.585 --> 00:19:32.219
and then just caramelized on the outside.

00:19:32.219 --> 00:19:33.920
(upbeat music)

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:37.513
Yeah, that tastes like
a griddle-fried custard.

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:40.163
I like it.

00:19:40.163 --> 00:19:41.740
And then the very friendly
lady selling the dessert,

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:43.576
she also recommended this,

00:19:43.576 --> 00:19:45.776
it's like a dessert snack pack.

00:19:45.776 --> 00:19:48.359
(upbeat music)

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:50.693
Wow.

00:19:50.693 --> 00:19:51.650
Yeah, that is sweet.

00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:52.660
You can taste the texture of it.

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:55.230
I don't know if that cornmeal or semolina.

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:57.813
(upbeat music)

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:02.750
Another ingredient I just cannot get over

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:04.560
from the East Coast of Malaysia

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:07.100
is tempoyak which is fermented durian.

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:08.860
And so I'm using this
opportunity at the market.

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:10.040
They have one stall in the center

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:12.870
that has some bottles
of the fermented durian.

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:14.280
I gotta buy some and take it home.

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.230
It's just too good to miss.

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:19.860
And as much as I'd like to
just stay in this market

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.660
for the rest of the
day and keep on eating,

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:22.493
we're gonna move on

00:20:22.493 --> 00:20:24.250
because we have a few more things to eat.

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:25.173
Nice to meet you.

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:27.976
And yeah, you can get lots of,

00:20:27.976 --> 00:20:31.483
you can buy tempoyak and
budu to bring home with you.

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:33.950
Two life-changing ingredients.

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:35.850
From here we are driving to again,

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:38.530
a little bit outside of town.

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:41.764
And we're going to eat
another rice and mixed dishes,

00:20:41.764 --> 00:20:43.940
especially vegetables that you eat

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:46.056
with the budu fermented fish sauce.

00:20:46.056 --> 00:20:48.639
(upbeat music)

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:53.413
Not too long.

00:20:53.413 --> 00:20:55.367
About a 20-minute drive
outside of Kota Bharu

00:20:55.367 --> 00:20:58.110
and we're in a place called Pasir Mas.

00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:59.630
Hello.

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:00.720
Nasi ulam?
- Yes.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.576
- Okay, great.

00:21:01.576 --> 00:21:03.687
(speaking foreign language)

00:21:03.687 --> 00:21:05.380
Ikan bacar.

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:06.213
Wow.

00:21:06.213 --> 00:21:07.046
So first you walk through the line

00:21:07.046 --> 00:21:07.910
and they have a bunch of curries.

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:09.990
You choose different curries
to go with your rice.

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:11.810
Then you come over here
to the condiment station

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:12.830
and at the condiment station,

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:15.020
one of the main condiments
that you're gonna wanna eat

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:16.327
with the raw vegetables is budu,

00:21:16.327 --> 00:21:18.380
and with your rice is the
fermented anchovy sauce

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:20.000
which is fixed with some chilies

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:20.950
and I think green mango.

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:22.720
And they have a whole tub of tempoyak

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.580
which is the fermented durian.

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:25.803
Oh, that smells so good.

00:21:25.803 --> 00:21:27.248
Tempoyak?
- Poyak, yes.

00:21:27.248 --> 00:21:28.081
- [Mark] Tempoyak, yeah.

00:21:28.081 --> 00:21:28.914
Very good.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:30.713
I love tempoyak.

00:21:31.848 --> 00:21:32.681
Yes.

00:21:35.449 --> 00:21:36.637
- Oh my gosh.
- Dude, they have a tub of it.

00:21:36.637 --> 00:21:38.773
They have a year's supply over there.

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:40.890
Now with some vegetables

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:43.800
and this is really the
ulam, the raw vegetables.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:48.080
These are some, I think
Asian pennywort leaves,

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.883
there's some winged beans.

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:52.970
Gonna get some winged beans.

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:56.760
These are the cashew tree
leaves, one of my favorites.

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:59.609
Gotta get a bunch of cucumbers and then.

00:21:59.609 --> 00:22:02.192
(upbeat music)

00:22:04.297 --> 00:22:05.297
Oh yes, yes.

00:22:08.668 --> 00:22:12.352
(speaking foreign language)

00:22:12.352 --> 00:22:13.860
Okay, it's there?
- Yes.

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:15.196
- Okay, thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

00:22:15.196 --> 00:22:16.537
(speaking foreign language)

00:22:16.537 --> 00:22:18.320
- So it's just kinda free for all.

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.970
You just grab and take whatever you want

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:21.850
and then they look at what you've got

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:24.840
and then they calculate
everything you took.

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.180
Add that all up, depending
on your portion size

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:29.190
and whatever you took, and
then you pay at the end.

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:31.756
Again, a spectacular restaurant.

00:22:31.756 --> 00:22:33.680
The staff are so friendly

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.640
and the owners of the
restaurant are so nice.

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:38.070
You gotta have rice and
you gotta have the ulam,

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:39.169
the raw vegetables.

00:22:39.169 --> 00:22:42.750
So that's what this meal is.

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:44.570
But then of course, we got a fish.

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:46.950
We got some shrimp curry,

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:47.905
we got some shells.

00:22:47.905 --> 00:22:50.920
We got some sup perut which is,

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:52.583
it appears to be a stomach,

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:56.660
a variety of stomachs
in a white milky broth.

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:58.150
Oh, and then tempoyak

00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:00.300
which you will not forget you got this

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:01.170
because you can,

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:03.440
the entire table and
restaurant smells of it.

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.800
And it smells incredible.

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.590
Budu is an amazing sauce
and they put chilies in it.

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:08.423
They put green mango.

00:23:08.423 --> 00:23:10.130
I think I'm gonna just start with some,

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:11.310
let's just try that budu.

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:15.541
And I've got a wad of, these
are cashew tree leaves.

00:23:15.541 --> 00:23:16.374
Mmm!

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:18.590
I'm gonna get a little bit of that mango

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:20.970
just to taste the budu first.

00:23:25.298 --> 00:23:26.699
Mmm!

00:23:26.699 --> 00:23:27.965
Mmm!

00:23:27.965 --> 00:23:28.798
Ooh!

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:36.240
The cashew tree leaves
are, those are chalky.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.200
- That's a flavor.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.870
- That melts right there immediately.

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:41.050
Okay, let's move into the ikan bakar.

00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:42.343
It has kind of a shell.

00:23:44.513 --> 00:23:45.359
Peel back.

00:23:45.359 --> 00:23:47.990
That's a really hard shell outer skin.

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:50.020
I think this is like a tuna

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:52.120
and then you can see that
sambal stuffed inside of there.

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:53.340
Grab a piece of that fish.

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:56.130
Now you dip that into the budu.

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:57.250
Stick that onto my rice.

00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:58.325
Then you can kinda mix in.

00:23:58.325 --> 00:24:00.083
You can go in with the chili

00:24:00.083 --> 00:24:03.400
and you can see immediately
how the budu sauce just,

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.670
it stains the rice in that red

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:08.160
red-orange color.

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.375
Grab a chili on this bite
with some of the fish.

00:24:10.375 --> 00:24:12.342
(upbeat music)

00:24:12.342 --> 00:24:13.573
Mmm!

00:24:13.573 --> 00:24:14.406
Mmm!

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.257
Oh.

00:24:17.257 --> 00:24:21.490
With the grilled fish, with
the budu, with the chili.

00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:22.336
Mmm!

00:24:22.336 --> 00:24:23.169
Mmm!

00:24:24.484 --> 00:24:27.200
There's this amazing flavor.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:31.373
And such a complexity of
fermented fish and salt.

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:33.153
That's umami.

00:24:33.153 --> 00:24:34.610
We gotta make the next step though.

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:37.015
I'm gonna scoop some of this tempoyak.

00:24:37.015 --> 00:24:39.288
(Joel laughing)

00:24:39.288 --> 00:24:41.010
It's unbelievable.

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:42.268
It's like,

00:24:42.268 --> 00:24:43.520
nothing compares to it.

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.490
This is the next level.

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:47.520
Tempoyak with budu.

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.560
Fermentation on top of fermentation.

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:51.600
Okay, I'm gonna take some of that.

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.053
I got a cucumber handy here.

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:56.980
I'm gonna just load up my cucumber

00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:59.360
with some tempoyak and budu.

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.110
Oh, and put a chili on top of that.

00:25:04.127 --> 00:25:06.215
Oh, that is a bite.

00:25:06.215 --> 00:25:07.048
Cheers, man!

00:25:10.541 --> 00:25:12.791
(laughing)

00:25:17.693 --> 00:25:19.039
Wow!

00:25:19.039 --> 00:25:19.872
Mmm!

00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:25.250
That is a ripened

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:26.410
durian tempoyak.

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:28.180
I've said this about 25 times so far

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:30.060
since being in Malaysia
in every single video

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:31.690
that we'd have tempoyak
in this entire trip

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:32.970
which has been every single day.

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:37.970
But tempoyak is the
ultimate shock and then joy.

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:39.503
Shock and joy.

00:25:39.503 --> 00:25:40.420
That's what it is.

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:42.020
Shock and joy every single bite.

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:44.197
This is some unripe banana.

00:25:44.197 --> 00:25:46.780
(upbeat music)

00:25:48.402 --> 00:25:51.424
(laughing)

00:25:51.424 --> 00:25:52.257
Oh, wow!

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:54.950
That's chalky!

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:56.260
The shrimp curry.

00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:58.710
I think it's best to add
this to your rice, yeah?

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:00.870
Some of the shrimp curry now.

00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:02.760
And then also some of the,

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.400
I think I'll just take
a mix of all the dishes.

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:07.166
The little snail shells
in coconut milk again.

00:26:07.166 --> 00:26:10.430
(upbeat music)

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:12.320
Stomach, tripe.

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.153
Tripe.

00:26:13.153 --> 00:26:14.490
Whoa, that's soupy.

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:16.740
Pour onto this side of the rice.

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:20.740
Some more of that soup,
that milky milky soup.

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:21.770
And then also what you can do

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:23.477
is take some of the budu and tempoyak

00:26:23.477 --> 00:26:25.570
and sort of put it into your rice

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:27.228
so that you can mix it with everything.

00:26:27.228 --> 00:26:29.811
(upbeat music)

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:33.640
Okay, I'll try that.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:34.493
Try that tripe.

00:26:37.175 --> 00:26:38.482
Mmm!

00:26:38.482 --> 00:26:39.443
Mmm!

00:26:39.443 --> 00:26:40.276
Oh.

00:26:40.276 --> 00:26:43.320
I got some tempoyak remains on that bite.

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.170
So soft.

00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:45.920
It's not even chewy at all.

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.090
It's so tender.

00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:48.410
Okay, I'm gonna try that shrimp next.

00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:52.340
It's just fully coated in
coconut milk-based curry

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:56.068
with turmeric I believe,
making it so yellow.

00:26:56.068 --> 00:26:58.651
(upbeat music)

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:00.980
I think that's a freshwater shrimp.

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:02.260
And then what you do
with these little guys

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:04.133
is you just suck them out.

00:27:05.725 --> 00:27:06.558
Mmm!

00:27:07.591 --> 00:27:08.982
I only got half of it.

00:27:08.982 --> 00:27:10.550
(Joel laughing)

00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:11.810
Okay, I got 'em.

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:12.643
Very small.

00:27:12.643 --> 00:27:13.510
(Joel laughing)

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:15.510
Just like a tiny, little, micro bite.

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:16.343
But really good.

00:27:16.343 --> 00:27:20.100
- And the sucking action,
if there's any curry liquid.

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:21.890
It vaporizes it onto your tongue

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:24.230
and you can really get a burst of flavor

00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:25.789
even though it's just a tiny amount.

00:27:25.789 --> 00:27:26.980
It's awesome.

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:29.400
(upbeat music)

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.500
- Scooping in with this big piece of fish.

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:34.520
Get that tempoyak onto the rice.

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:35.483
Onto the rice.

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:39.020
And you kinda wanna really
mix everything together.

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:42.590
Get that fish mixed in with the rice,

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:45.920
with the tempoyak, with
the budu, with the chili.

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.620
All of that in one,

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:52.620
just ultra powerful, ultra
satisfying bite of your lifetime.

00:27:52.772 --> 00:27:55.355
(upbeat music)

00:27:57.070 --> 00:27:58.860
And let me tell you,

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:00.901
that is a bite of your lifetime.

00:28:00.901 --> 00:28:03.484
(upbeat music)

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:10.418
We're hanging out with the owner now.

00:28:10.418 --> 00:28:11.431
(speaking foreign language)

00:28:11.431 --> 00:28:12.264
- Welcome.

00:28:12.264 --> 00:28:13.430
(speaking foreign language)

00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:15.110
- It was an amazing meal.

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:16.110
She's so nice.

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:17.755
Again, just so welcoming.

00:28:17.755 --> 00:28:19.478
So hospitable.

00:28:19.478 --> 00:28:20.311
D'umi.

00:28:20.311 --> 00:28:21.144
- [Owner] D'umi.

00:28:21.144 --> 00:28:23.510
- D'umi Nasi Ulam.
- Ulam.

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:25.835
- It's in Pasir Mas.
- Pasir Mas.

00:28:25.835 --> 00:28:26.668
- D'umi.
- Yes.

00:28:26.668 --> 00:28:27.960
- Okay, we've got one more place to go

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:31.030
which is actually just down the road.

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:33.090
Probably even walking distance from here.

00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:34.460
But it's in the same area.

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:37.040
Famous for a special
type of grilled chicken

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.190
which is from Kelantan.

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:40.310
When we pulled up here

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:41.530
I was afraid they were closed

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:43.669
because it looks really
quiet and the grill is empty

00:28:43.669 --> 00:28:45.330
but luckily they are open.

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:46.740
They have one tray left.

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.500
I think they open in the morning

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:50.050
and kinda sell out by the afternoon.

00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:51.840
So we're just here in time to taste it

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:52.964
even though the grill is not full.

00:28:52.964 --> 00:28:54.050
They got two skewers.

00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:55.130
They're reheating them for us.

00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:56.970
This is called ayam percik.

00:28:56.970 --> 00:28:57.860
It's from Kelantan.

00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:01.500
It's a local Kelantanese
style of grilled chicken

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:05.361
with coconut cream barbecue sauce.

00:29:05.361 --> 00:29:07.944
(upbeat music)

00:29:13.749 --> 00:29:15.279
(speaking foreign language)

00:29:15.279 --> 00:29:16.490
Once it comes up the grill

00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:19.530
then they ladle on some more
of the coconut barbecue sauce.

00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:20.580
It's very light in color.

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:22.070
There you can see a little
bit of chilies in there.

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:22.903
It's almost orange

00:29:22.903 --> 00:29:25.556
but you can see the creamy
richness of the coconut.

00:29:25.556 --> 00:29:27.180
We're gonna take some to go.

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:28.563
But we gotta sample it right now.

00:29:28.563 --> 00:29:30.330
I'm just glad that we got here

00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:33.083
and they still have a few pieces
left that we could sample.

00:29:34.991 --> 00:29:36.207
- Mhmm!

00:29:36.207 --> 00:29:37.723
(Joel laughing)

00:29:37.723 --> 00:29:39.556
- [Mark and Joel] Mmm!

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:42.668
- It's so rich.

00:29:42.668 --> 00:29:44.070
It's sweet and nutty.

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:44.910
It's really good though.

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:46.440
And smoky.

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:48.140
- That sauce that he dipped.

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:50.340
The fresh addition of sauce was awesome.

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:51.880
- I think they must add a couple of layers

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.810
of the coconut cream
sauce as they grill it.

00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:56.680
So those layers caramelize
onto the chicken.

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:59.610
But then you've also got some
fresh coconut barbecue sauce

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:00.443
on top of it.

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:06.150
It's so similar but slightly
different to the gai golae,

00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:09.230
same similar style of coconut
milk barbecue sauce chicken

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:11.050
that we eat in Southern
Thailand very frequently.

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:12.160
And as I was taking that bite,

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.570
he came over, I didn't even see him,

00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:15.750
but he added another ladle
of the barbecue sauce

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:16.583
all over it.

00:30:16.583 --> 00:30:18.514
(speaking foreign language)

00:30:18.514 --> 00:30:19.347
Thank you.

00:30:19.347 --> 00:30:20.180
(speaking foreign language)

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:21.200
It's the middle of the afternoon

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.410
and we have come to the end

00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:25.740
of this Kelantanese
Malay food tour in Kota

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:28.630
and surrounding Kota Bharu, Kelantan.

00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:30.789
I'll have all the information
in the description box below.

00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:32.770
It's been an amazing day

00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:35.040
and I love it here.

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.249
It's so chilled out, it's so relaxed.

00:30:37.249 --> 00:30:38.600
And the people,
