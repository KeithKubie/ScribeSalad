trying to communicate science to the
 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.680
trying to communicate science to the
public and the interesting thing to me

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:24.690
public and the interesting thing to me
 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.779
public and the interesting thing to me
is that that means that there are a lot

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789
is that that means that there are a lot
 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.310
is that that means that there are a lot
of people that don't know me very well

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320
of people that don't know me very well
 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.290

yeah the reason this person is on

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719
yeah the reason this person is on
 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.180
yeah the reason this person is on
television is she must be the best

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190
television is she must be the best
 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.220

students and they say well how did you

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899
students and they say well how did you
 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:13.099
students and they say well how did you
become a success or another great

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:13.109

question these days is how did you
 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.499
question these days is how did you
overcome failure and the funny thing is

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509
overcome failure and the funny thing is
 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.300

I found myself really kind of at a loss

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310
I found myself really kind of at a loss
 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.660
I found myself really kind of at a loss
because the very concepts of success and

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670
because the very concepts of success and
 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.440
because the very concepts of success and
failure I think are words that never

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450
failure I think are words that never
 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.749
failure I think are words that never
really meant anything and I actually I

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759
really meant anything and I actually I
 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.940

defined as a success and if you do

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630
defined as a success and if you do

the same time the idea that you ever

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469
the same time the idea that you ever
 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.499
the same time the idea that you ever
really fail at something there are

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509
really fail at something there are
 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.240
really fail at something there are
plenty of times that I very nearly

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250
plenty of times that I very nearly
 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.830
plenty of times that I very nearly
failed differential equations and

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840
failed differential equations and
 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.059
failed differential equations and
calculus you know there were things that

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069
calculus you know there were things that
 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.459
calculus you know there were things that
I was not very good at but I eventually

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:13.469
I was not very good at but I eventually
 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:14.990
I was not very good at but I eventually
got them on say that the third or fourth

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000

and the problem was just you know

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450
and the problem was just you know
 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.479
and the problem was just you know
staying around and telling yourself that

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489
staying around and telling yourself that
 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.369
staying around and telling yourself that
I really want to learn this I'm just not

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379
I really want to learn this I'm just not
 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.490
I really want to learn this I'm just not
gonna leave until I do

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500
gonna leave until I do

there wasn't any really true failure

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659
there wasn't any really true failure
 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:30.229
there wasn't any really true failure
either it was always kind of twisted up

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239
either it was always kind of twisted up

actually working through and trying to

actually working through and trying to
 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.940
actually working through and trying to
learn so this idea that's at some point

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950
learn so this idea that's at some point

feel like a success yes I am successful
 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.099
feel like a success yes I am successful
now I get very very nervous when people

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109
now I get very very nervous when people
 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:48.080
now I get very very nervous when people
ask me about that but how did you become

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090
ask me about that but how did you become
 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.000

and all the things I did wrong and all
the reasons I'm not a success and at the

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980
the reasons I'm not a success and at the
 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.440
the reasons I'm not a success and at the
same time when everybody anybody calls

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450
same time when everybody anybody calls
 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.899
same time when everybody anybody calls
me a failure it's like I want to sit you

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909
me a failure it's like I want to sit you
 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:01.369

way you feel about yourself and it's a
 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.750
way you feel about yourself and it's a
strange model we give young people try

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760
strange model we give young people try
 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.789
strange model we give young people try
to be a success try to overcome failure

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799
to be a success try to overcome failure
 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.119
to be a success try to overcome failure
I all I can do is just kind of breathe

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129
I all I can do is just kind of breathe
 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:28.670
I all I can do is just kind of breathe
and just realize that at no point in my

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680
and just realize that at no point in my
 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.190
and just realize that at no point in my
life am I going to separate those two

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200
 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.400
