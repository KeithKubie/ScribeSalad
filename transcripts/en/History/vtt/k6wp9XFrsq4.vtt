00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.500
[music playing]

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:08.040
NARRATOR: Sima de las
Palomas, Spain, 2011.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.000
Archaeologists unearth a
prehistoric grave containing

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.170
three individuals buried side
by side with their arms folded

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.960
in a ritualistic fashion.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.380
Because of the manner
of their burial,

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.670
the archaeologists assume the
remains are human, but are

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.580
surprised to discover
that they are

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.920
actually our evolutionary
cousin, Neanderthal.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.250
It takes a good
deal of imagination

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.750
to prepare the dead.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.830
It suggests some kind of
notion of an afterlife.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.330
If there is that, there
is usually a notion

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.580
of a deity of some kind.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.920
That is fairly complicated
religious thinking,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.420
suggesting that the
Neanderthals had

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.250
a capacity for
symbolic reasoning

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.670
and the formation of culture.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.250
This suggests a level of
civilization, or at least,

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.460
the protoculture,
that is further

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.750
along than we used to think.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.040
Neanderthals, unfortunately,
because of early discoveries

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.880
that made them look
like a brutish caveman,

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.120
not intelligent,
that they're very,

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.250
very different from us, they
were shorter and stockier--

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.290
but they had huge brains.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.380
They clearly had clothing.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.620
They cared for their
sick and elderly.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:27.960
They were very intelligent.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.420
NARRATOR: In 2014,
scientists analyzed materials

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.960
from 40 different
archaeological sites

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.210
to determine a
reliable extinction

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.120
date for Neanderthals.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.420
The date they came up
with is 40,000 years ago,

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.750
suggesting they coexisted
with Homo sapiens

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.000
for at least 1,000 years.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.500
But just why did they die off?

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.250
At this point, we
don't know exactly why

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.830
these other species died off.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.330
Certainly, it does
broadly coincide

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.960
with the expansion of
anatomically modern humans

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.290
to all parts of the globe.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.460
But contrary to our
notions from the past,

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.250
it doesn't look like it was a
lack of intelligence that led

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.210
to the demise of Neanderthals.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.040
NARRATOR: Although Neanderthals
are long extinct, in 2013,

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.380
evolutionary
geneticists discovered

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.880
select modern human
populations carry genomes

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.880
from both Neanderthal
and Denisovans,

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.540
suggesting that, at some
point, interbreeding occurred.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.460
Neanderthal genetic
markers are concentrated

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.170
in populations in Europe and
parts of the Middle East.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.540
Denisovan markers can be
found in the mainland Asian

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.880
populations, as well as
Pacific Islander, New Guineans,

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.920
and Australian Aborigines.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.210
According to some ancient
astronaut theorists,

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.380
this interbreeding may be the
key to understanding the demise

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.670
of the other intelligent
hominid species that once

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.080
shared the planet with humans.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.330
Consider the possibility that
these different hominid strains

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.830
were meant to be
kept geologically

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.420
separated from each other
across tracts of land that were

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.880
considered to be too vast
for them to ultimately come

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.330
into contact with one another.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.330
Is it possible that
interbreeding was frowned upon

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.540
and that once interbreeding
with Neanderthals

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.960
started to take place, it
was damaging the very essence

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.120
of the experiment,
and because of that,

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.080
the Neanderthal strain
had to be terminated

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.920
or removed from the planet
to stop this from happening?

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.250
When we look at ancient texts,
particularly religious texts

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.420
from millennia ago, what we
find is the idea of the gods

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.620
or a god wanting to
create a human that was

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.460
pure, physically and morally.

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:20.920
What we also find are accounts
where the wrath of God

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.120
or the wrath of
the gods hammered

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.790
down on us for,
essentially, going

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.620
off the rails, so to speak.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.250
And we could make a case
that this was some example

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:39.120
of extraterrestrial intervention
to essentially try and purify,

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.670
again, the species.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.670
And that might have
involved wiping

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:47.420
out significant portions of
early humans and starting over.
