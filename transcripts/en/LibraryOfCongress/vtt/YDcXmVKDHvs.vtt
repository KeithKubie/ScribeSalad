COLLEEN SHOGAN: Good afternoon and welcome
to the Library of Congress.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.900
My name is Colleen Shogan and I'm the Deputy
Director of the National and International

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.900
Outreach at the Library.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.760
I'm excited to welcome our audience inside
the historic Members Room of the Jefferson

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.470
Building here on Capitol Hill.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.910
And I'm equally excited to welcome our virtual
audience joining us via live stream.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:43.560
A video recording of this event will be made
available on our website.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.370
March is Women's History Month and we're delighted
to celebrate it with our new boss, Carla Hayden,

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.370
who happens to be the first woman and the
first African American to assume this position

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.799
of Librarian of Congress.

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:08.140
[applause]
A few months ago, I noticed a lot of innovative

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.710
accomplishments have begun to happen at the
Library.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.340
So, what had changed?

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.110
Well, you all know what had changed.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.519
One woman and her leadership can make a world
of difference and today's panel is living

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:22.840
proof of that.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.730
Before we start, I would like to thank the
Library of Congress' Office of EEO and Diversity

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.700
for making this program possible today.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.519
Now, I'd like to briefly introduce our participants
before turning it over to Dr. Hayden for our

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:36.519
discussion.

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.650
Marin Alsop is the 12th musical director for
the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:46.180
She is the first woman to head a major American
orchestra and the only conductor to receive

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.540
the prestigious McArthur Fellowship.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.670
In 2010, she was inducted into the Classical
Music Hall of Fame.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:00.040
Previously, she was the first principal conductor
and then the musical director of the Colorado

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.910
Symphony Orchestra.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.549
In addition to her numerous awards, she has
lead the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra in key

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:12.310
outreach initiatives, resulting in greater
youth musical awareness and appreciation.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.880
A student of Leonard Bernstein, Alsop grew
up in New York City and is a graduate of Yale

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.150
University and Julliard.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.410
Deborah Rutter is the third President of the
John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.410
Arts.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.540
She is the first woman to lead the center.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.820
In her capacity as President, she is the Artistic
and Administrative Director of the Kennedy

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.030
Center, managing all aspects of the institution.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.590
Prior to her current position, Ms. Rutter
served as President of the Chicago Symphony

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.690
Orchestra and Executive Director of the Seattle
Symphony.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:52.099
Yo Yo Ma credits her for making the Chicago
Orchestra more accessible to a wider audience

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:57.710
through innovative educational programs and
community engagement, a model she is currently

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.900
replicating at the Kennedy Center.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.060
A native of Pennsylvania and Los Angeles,
Rutter is a graduate of Stanford University

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.840
and holds an MBA from USC.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.250
Molly Smith has served as the Artistic Director
of the Arena Stage since 1998.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.870
She has lead the invention of the Arena Stage
with a vision of creating a national center

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.870
for American artists.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:28.280
In 2010, the Washingtonian famously referred
to her as the unsinkable Molly Smith.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.970
[laughter]
During her leadership, Arena has workshopped

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:37.780
more than 100 productions, produced 39 world
premieres, and developed 9 projects that have

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:38.950
headed to Broadway.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:43.870
Before coming to Washington, Ms. Smith was
the Artistic Director of the Perseverance

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.840
Theater in Juneau, Alaska.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.460
She has served as the literary advisor to
the Sundance Theater Lab and formed the Arena

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.520
Stage Writers Council, whose members are leading
American playwrights.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:00.300
Ms. Smith is a graduate of Catholic University
and has a Master's Degree in Theater from

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.580
American University.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:06.889
Our moderator today is Carla Hayden, the 14th
Librarian of Congress.

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:26.530
Please join me in welcoming these distinguished
women to 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:27.680
the Library of Congress.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.680
[applause]
CARLA HAYDEN: I must tell you that I've been

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.440
the Librarian of Congress for 6 months and
I've had many many wonderful opportunities

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:41.060
to interact with many people, the collections
and things, but I have to tell you, this is

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.210
super special for me.

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:48.810
Because I have admired Marin for a long time.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:58.880
I've gotten to be very jealous of Deborah
with that and that unsinkable Molly.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:59.880
Wow.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:08.650
So, it's wonderful to be with you and to have
what I hope will be an honest and engaging

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:18.400
discussion about being women in the arts in
particular but also in leadership positions.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:24.930
When I was introduced as the first African
American, which is of course very significant

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:32.060
in many ways for me personally, but being
a woman in a feminized profession, where 85%

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:43.970
of the workforce is female and the top leadership
does not reflect that fact, is really significant

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:47.180
for my profession and has been talked about.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:52.730
So, in my journey, I had the beginning, not
even knowing I was going to be the Librarian

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.789
- being an accidental librarian, I call it.

00:07:55.789 --> 00:08:02.000
And I wondered how your journey started in
terms of the arts and then how did you make

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.860
that shift from being in the arts to arts
management and leadership.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:11.389
When did that switch happen?

00:08:11.389 --> 00:08:12.389
Molly?

00:08:12.389 --> 00:08:15.090
MOLLY SMITH: Sure, sure.

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:21.240
Well, I was interested in arts and theater
from when I was a little girl and went to

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:27.909
Catholic school and thought I was going to
go into a pre-law degree.

00:08:27.909 --> 00:08:33.860
And in the middle of traveling through Europe
at the age of 19 with a backpack on, I decided

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:38.680
I was going to chuck all that, follow my heart
and start a theater in Alaska, ok?

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:39.690
How crazy.

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:40.820
Everybody thought I was crazy.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:46.949
So, in a sense, I moved from artist to administrator
right away, studied for the next 7 years to

00:08:46.949 --> 00:08:52.800
make that happen and then drug 50 USC students
to Alaska to start the Perseverance Theater.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.690
That's still alive and kicking now.

00:08:54.690 --> 00:09:00.000
It's 38 years old and then about 19 years
ago, I came to Arena Stage.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.640
So, I think I'm an artist whose always wanted
a home and often times when you want a home,

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:11.959
it also means that you combine the artistry
with management.

00:09:11.959 --> 00:09:13.860
CARLA HAYDEN: Unsinkable.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.030
DEBORAH RUTTER: Great name - Perseverance.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:22.670
CARLA HAYDEN: And Deborah, you had an interesting
way of getting into management from art.

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:26.440
DEBORAH RUTTER: Well, actually I think mine
is very parallel.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:33.449
As a young person, I was the beneficiary of
a time when there was music and art in schools.

00:09:33.449 --> 00:09:40.040
So, in my public school, I had the opportunity
to become a violinist, literally.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.940
My third grade teacher said, "which instrument
will you play?"

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:45.819
Not, "would you like to play, but will you
play?"

00:09:45.819 --> 00:09:48.160
Played in orchestras and followed my heart.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:53.500
Thought I was going to go off and get some
other job, not really knowing that there was

00:09:53.500 --> 00:10:02.710
such a thing until I was in college and was
introduced through family friends to the field.

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:07.600
And had my first Summer job, my first real
summer job, I had other summer jobs.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:15.940
My first real Summer job was at the Hollywood
bowl for the Los Angeles Philharmonic and

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:17.890
I decided there was this whole world of arts
management.

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:22.370
So, I took a pretty traditional course in
this way, but I would say that every decision

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:28.740
I made in my life was following my heart which
needed to follow music and I was never going

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:33.400
to be able to spend enough time in a practice
room to be doing what she does.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.870
So, I get to support.

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:38.120
Basically what I do is to support what these
two people do.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.360
CARLA HAYDEN: And that's great.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.730
And violin?

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:46.970
MARIN ALSOP: I was a violinist of course,
but when I saw...

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:50.439
My dad took me to a young people's concert
when I was 9.

00:10:50.439 --> 00:10:55.230
And I was getting in a lot of trouble playing
violin and trying to lead the orchestra from

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:58.910
the back of the violins at Julliard, pre college.

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:03.230
So, then, this guy came out to conduct who
was jumping around like a lunatic.

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:06.800
And I turned to my dad and said, "I could
be the conductor because nobody's yelling

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.470
at him."

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:15.079
I was 9 and that was Leonard Bernstein and
eventually he became my teacher and mentor.

00:11:15.079 --> 00:11:18.100
And he was my hero for my entire life.

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:23.040
But, I think as a conductor and especially
as a woman, in a field where there were very

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:28.130
few women, you have to be an entrepreneur
because you don't have an instrument as a

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:29.130
conductor.

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:35.000
Unless you can coerce 20 or 30 people are
coming over every day to practice with you.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.020
You don't have an instrument.

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:41.890
So, it's all about what you can put together
and the way I learned how to conduct was by

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:44.290
getting all of my friends together and creating
an orchestra.

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:50.920
So, I ran my own first orchestra and learned
hands on how to do marketing and build a board

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.890
and all those kinds of great things.

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:57.380
So, now I'm just a really annoying music director
because I know a little bit too much.

00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:03.090
I don't know enough about management, but
I know more than I should.

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:07.220
[laughter]
You're just lucky you don't have me.

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:15.390
CARLA HAYDEN: Are there special challenges
for women in the arts in terms of pay equity,

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:16.390
discrimination?

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:18.300
Have you experienced that?

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:23.270
MARIN ALSOP: You know that's such a, from
my perspective, that's a question I'm asked

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:30.270
often, especially by journalists and I think
it's, I don't know the arts are such a difficult

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:31.580
field anyway.

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:38.360
It's really hard to ascertain which aspect
of what you're doing is causing some kind

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:44.380
of discrimination because there are so many
ways that you can run into obstacles.

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:54.100
And I really think that, I think that for
me, I think part of my success is never attributing

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:59.299
any of my difficulties or rejections to being
a woman.

00:12:59.299 --> 00:13:04.959
I think that, instead, I always thought, "ok,
I have to be better.

00:13:04.959 --> 00:13:09.880
Let me try to, how can I get something positive
out of this and learn from it and apply it

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:10.910
to what I'm doing?"

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:13.040
So, that's how I've reacted to it.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.699
I don't know if you've had similar experiences.

00:13:14.699 --> 00:13:22.450
DEBORAH RUTTER: What I would imagine for you
and is true certainly in my experience is

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:27.440
that there are preconceptions about what people
believe should happen.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.459
You know, what will a woman wear on a podium?

00:13:30.459 --> 00:13:37.750
What do women wear if they're a soloist playing
the violin or the piano or anything, the flute?

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:38.750
Whatever it is.

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:45.480
So, there are just gender expectations and
those expectations are one that we all have,

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.480
male and female.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.480
MARIN ALSOP: Yes, that's true.

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.820
DEBORAH RUTTER: And that we all sort of have
to deal with and understand.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:56.000
And those are the kinds of expectations that
are difficult to overcome.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.260
Because if you don't fall in line, then there's
going to be a discussion, "well, she didn't

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:01.819
fall in line."

00:14:01.819 --> 00:14:08.750
So, how many men have to buy gowns to do their
work?

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:09.870
I have to buy them.

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:11.620
People ask me, "what are you wearing tonight?"

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:15.600
When's the last time somebody asked a man,
what he was wearing to an event?

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.579
CARLA HAYDEN: Especially to a black tie event.

00:14:17.579 --> 00:14:19.439
DEBORAH RUTTER: Exactly.

00:14:19.439 --> 00:14:23.819
So, I think Marin's comment is right.

00:14:23.819 --> 00:14:27.559
The arts is a different kind of business.

00:14:27.559 --> 00:14:33.671
And so the interactions that we have with
our bosses, the interactions that we have

00:14:33.671 --> 00:14:38.740
with our patrons, with our potential patrons
are all a little bit different.

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:44.929
But there's always this issue of how do people
treat women and men what the expectations

00:14:44.929 --> 00:14:48.660
are I think that's the part that you are constantly
working to overcome.

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:55.480
MOLLY SMITH: There are pretty shocking statistics
in theater as far as men and women.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:15:02.370
Of the major theaters in the United States
and there are 1800 theaters now that really

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:06.890
started by three intrepid women which really
included Zelda Fitch Handler of the Arena

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:10.000
Stage 70 years ago.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.949
And there are large theaters and of the large
theaters and of the large theaters, only twenty

00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:20.679
percent are run by women.

00:15:20.679 --> 00:15:28.400
In terms of plays that are produced by these
1800 theaters, only 22% are written by women.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:32.030
So, let that penny drop.

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:33.140
Start to look at that.

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:38.189
When you realize that that's happening at
the leadership level, that means it's happening

00:15:38.189 --> 00:15:43.709
because boards are leaning more into male
candidates.

00:15:43.709 --> 00:15:49.470
It means that headhunters perhaps have more
males who are headhunters.

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:55.910
It means that we have to do much more in terms
of mentorship of young women who are coming

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:58.410
up and support them.

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:02.100
In terms of changing the paradigm, it's a
paradigm shift.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:06.240
I mean, I would agree with what everybody
else has said, but then I think there's the

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:13.680
other piece that just has to do with statistical
difficulties of what women face in terms of

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.150
leadership positions.

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:16.450
It is that you have to be better.

00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:20.790
Wasn't it Flo Kennedy that said, "Fortunately,
that's not difficult"?

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:27.270
[laughter]
That was a very funny line, but it's complicated

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:31.449
and I think the idea of mentorship is so powerful.

00:16:31.449 --> 00:16:32.929
Because it is the step in.

00:16:32.929 --> 00:16:35.120
It is the door opening.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:40.289
Even for me, more than education, it takes
you in a whole other direction because mentorship

00:16:40.289 --> 00:16:44.900
is a one on one relationship that shows you
the path.

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:51.190
And I think without mentors for me like Joy
Zimmerman and Paula Vogel, who's a brilliant

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:52.900
playwright, I don't know if I would be here.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:57.760
MARIN ALSOP: The statistics in classical music
are even more dire.

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:02.870
I think of our programming, is it 5% by women
composers?

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:08.319
It's really and I'm sure for conductors, it
ranges around there as well.

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:15.620
But, I would just jump in to say that I agree
so much about this concept about mentorship.

00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:19.660
But also, I had a recent, if I can tell a
little anecdote.

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:24.860
I was conducting in Lucerne at the festival
this summer.

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:30.039
It's just I'm giving a master class for young
women conductors and an older woman in her

00:17:30.039 --> 00:17:32.700
80s came and talked to me and someone said,
"Oh, do you know who she is?"

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.300
I said, "no, but she seems to know a lot about
conducting."

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:42.740
Well, her name is Sylvia Kaduf and I had never
heard her name and so I found out from someone

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:48.240
else that she was Bernstein's assistant in
1966 in the New York Philharmonic.

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:52.299
She was the first woman to win the Metropolis
competition, also the first woman to conduct

00:17:52.299 --> 00:17:53.330
the Berlin Philharmonic.

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:54.710
And I had never heard of her.

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:56.200
I had never heard of her.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:02.880
So, I went back to Lucerne two weeks ago with
a film crew I hired from Berlin and I'm making

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.190
a film about her.

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:11.169
And it was awesome to find her story, but
also this idea of how can we change the landscape?

00:18:11.169 --> 00:18:14.940
If we don't do it- the three of us here, nobody's
going to do it.

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:20.010
So, for me that meant, for conducting, and
tell me if I talk too much, I might be there

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:21.030
already.

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:25.740
[laughter]
But, for conducting, you know for women, you

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:30.160
get one opportunity to conduct and you have
to remember that you haven't practiced with

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:37.299
your instrument before and all of the information
that you're trying to process and adapt to

00:18:37.299 --> 00:18:43.080
and adjust to is so overwhelming and you have
only one chance, so you can't make a mistake.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:47.830
And, you have to be able to make mistakes
in order to really achieve greatness, in my

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:48.830
opinion.

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:53.919
So, in 2002, I started a fellowship for women
conductors, young women conductors.

00:18:53.919 --> 00:18:58.200
And I bring them around to orchestras I'm
conducting and they just do the opening piece.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:03.260
So, it's not the pressure of the whole concert
on them and get some feedback from musicians

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:05.850
and from managers and things like that.

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:12.429
I have to say that of the 11 winners of the
fellowship, 4 or now American music directors,

00:19:12.429 --> 00:19:16.289
5 are assistants with major orchestras, and
2 started their own orchestras.

00:19:16.289 --> 00:19:22.210
So, I feel that you know, at least in a small
way, maybe by creating opportunities, but

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:27.159
this is to your point, that society isn't
accustomed to seeing women in these positions,

00:19:27.159 --> 00:19:29.600
so we have to try to change that.

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:30.789
Even for me too.

00:19:30.789 --> 00:19:34.250
Seeing women in certain roles, it's a little
jarring.

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:39.740
CARLA HAYDEN: It's jarring to normalize it,
to say that it's not anything unusual.

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:42.830
MARIN ALSOP: And we're predisposed to being
receptive to that.

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:43.830
CARLA HAYDEN: Right.

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:49.789
Deborah, are you doing some things in terms
of encouraging more diversity?

00:19:49.789 --> 00:19:52.820
DEBORAH RUTTER: Well, a couple of different
things.

00:19:52.820 --> 00:20:00.440
I wanted to say which is what I know about
the work that they do is that the level of

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:04.159
individual self-promotion has to be pretty
high.

00:20:04.159 --> 00:20:10.080
And we who are the ones making the choices
along the way, have to be really open to it.

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:14.919
And it's really important for us to understand
that sometimes those behaviors of self-promotion

00:20:14.919 --> 00:20:23.919
amongst, and this goes again to what is expected,
understood in different ways, is that a woman

00:20:23.919 --> 00:20:29.060
being self-promoting, could be conceived as
aggressive.

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:32.830
Whereas a man doing that is just doing his
job, right?

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:39.090
So, there's always this sort of balance of
perception and there has to be the mentorship

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:41.020
and the open invitation.

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:48.889
Because as I think about it, it's really hard
sometimes to sort of cut through to see the

00:20:48.889 --> 00:20:51.240
true gem that is there without the self-promotion.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:56.570
So, it's one of those things that we have
to add to our tool kit in a way that feels

00:20:56.570 --> 00:21:00.779
comfortable for us, but that for others can
receive it as well.

00:21:00.779 --> 00:21:07.149
For us at the center and as a manager, and
administrator, in fact women are not the problem.

00:21:07.149 --> 00:21:10.180
Sometimes we need to find more men to sit
around the table with us.

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:15.529
Because we are a mission driven institutions,
we are magnets for women who care about what

00:21:15.529 --> 00:21:21.690
they're doing and women like me, who said,
"well I love to sing or I love to play the

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:24.970
cello, but I wasn't good enough, so I can
go and work there."

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:30.909
And at the center, we have countless dancers
and actors and people who are former somethings

00:21:30.909 --> 00:21:32.299
who come and work.

00:21:32.299 --> 00:21:39.100
So, internal for us, is not so much the issue
of gender, but it's really about the issue

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:42.539
of diversity background.

00:21:42.539 --> 00:21:49.080
And this is something that is very important
to me and that we're working to really put

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:50.269
a focus on this.

00:21:50.269 --> 00:21:55.850
And our HR team has a whole new diversity
and inclusion plan.

00:21:55.850 --> 00:22:00.269
Most importantly, is that we're developing
something beyond the mentorship which is a

00:22:00.269 --> 00:22:01.419
true fellowship program.

00:22:01.419 --> 00:22:08.630
And that fellowship is about identifying future
arts administrators with diverse backgrounds,

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:14.179
diverse interests, and bringing them into
the center and really doing the same kind

00:22:14.179 --> 00:22:21.159
of thing that you have done and sort of helping
give that extra boost, that extra lift.

00:22:21.159 --> 00:22:22.440
MARIN ALSOP: But on the administrative side.

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:27.860
DEBORAH RUTTER: On the administrative, because
if you don't have, it works in both ways.

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:31.899
You know, if you don't have the leadership,
they don't have the vision, the perspective

00:22:31.899 --> 00:22:32.899
to offer.

00:22:32.899 --> 00:22:38.970
And so, this is about having a table of people
around which you put so many different voices

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:40.990
and making sure all of the voices are heard.

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:42.769
It's a big priority for us.

00:22:42.769 --> 00:22:44.149
CARLA HAYDEN: That's great.

00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:49.309
MOLLY SMITH: We have a fellows and internship
program at Arena Stage called the Alan Lee

00:22:49.309 --> 00:22:56.649
Hughes Fellowship program that has been going
now for 25 years and it is for young people

00:22:56.649 --> 00:22:59.029
from diverse backgrounds.

00:22:59.029 --> 00:23:03.639
Over 700 people have been through it and because
we've just hit the 25th year, we went back

00:23:03.639 --> 00:23:07.070
to find out how many people are still working
in the arts.

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:08.389
92%.

00:23:08.389 --> 00:23:12.010
So, this is again, a one on one internship
program.

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:19.120
It's been going for a long time in every area
like theater management, artistic directing,

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:24.409
playwriting, just about every area, lighting
designer.

00:23:24.409 --> 00:23:31.580
And our field now is rife with young people
that have come out of this program.

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:37.210
Also make sure because I believe every act
that we make in the arts is a political act.

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:41.230
Probably every act we make in our lives is
a political act because it's about choices,

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:42.230
right?

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:49.830
And so this year, seven out of our ten plays
are written by women or men of color because

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:58.399
I combine that in terms of what I see as far
as diversity and there are 8 plays directed

00:23:58.399 --> 00:24:00.570
by women or men of color.

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:06.820
And I try and balance it on a yearly basis
because I think who you put on stage, those

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:12.030
are the voices that the audiences hear and
that's the way audiences start to change their

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:15.879
perspective of who is a leader and who isn't
a leader.

00:24:15.879 --> 00:24:21.080
So, we just keep trying to right the balance
as far as the programming and the ideas we

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:22.080
put on stage.

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:27.159
MARIN ALSOP: From my perspective of course,
when I came to the Baltimore Symphony and

00:24:27.159 --> 00:24:33.210
looking at the make-up of the orchestra on
stage, you know the Baltimore Symphony has

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:42.210
and still has one African American member
and how to change that, how to change that

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:48.379
make-up, I mean it's a long ranging vision
that one has to take.

00:24:48.379 --> 00:24:56.799
You have to take, ok in my lifetime it may
not happen, but the reality is that the kids

00:24:56.799 --> 00:25:01.940
aren't getting access to instruments young
enough in order to gain, first of all, the

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:07.600
interest and the skill to audition for an
orchestra at this level.

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:13.090
So, that's when I approached my musicians
and said, "listen, why don't we mentor one

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:14.210
kid in the neighborhood."

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:21.550
That didn't go so well, but the idea, the
idea developed into a program where we started

00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:28.970
with 30 kindergarten kids in 2008 and today
we have almost 1500 kids playing instruments

00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:34.059
and there are 17 are now at the high school
for performing arts, they've been accepted

00:25:34.059 --> 00:25:37.660
because they are now getting old enough to
get to high school age.

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:42.289
But, you know, how long it will take for a
program like Orch Kids and for some other

00:25:42.289 --> 00:25:49.049
programs that have come up to impact our major
orchestras and our major stages, who knows?

00:25:49.049 --> 00:25:52.929
But if we don't start, you know that's the
point, right?

00:25:52.929 --> 00:25:56.350
And also it affects our audiences.

00:25:56.350 --> 00:26:00.450
Now all of these kids and their parents are
big classical music fans.

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:04.210
CARLA HAYDEN: Because they attend the performances
because of their children.

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:10.490
So, that gets to what Deborah you mentioned,
there are very few arts programs now in schools.

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:16.669
So, isn't that a big challenge in terms of
looking at your future audiences?

00:26:16.669 --> 00:26:18.230
Your future?

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:22.150
DEBORAH RUTTER: Well I could talk for the
next three hours on this topic.

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:26.340
CARLA HAYDEN: We're going to open it up for
question and answer in a minute.

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:30.669
DEBORAH RUTTER: You know, I most recently
lived in Chicago and what was really interesting

00:26:30.669 --> 00:26:38.019
was the northern suburbs had fantastic music
programs because the school districts in that

00:26:38.019 --> 00:26:45.171
area were wealthy enough and had leadership
and input from family enough that they had

00:26:45.171 --> 00:26:46.509
really great programs.

00:26:46.509 --> 00:26:52.029
It was the schools in the city and on the
Southside that were suffering the most from

00:26:52.029 --> 00:26:53.029
this.

00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:59.809
And the tragedy of this is that the programs
around any kind of art, whether its dance

00:26:59.809 --> 00:27:06.669
or theater or music are what keep kids in
school, keep them focused, get them really

00:27:06.669 --> 00:27:10.400
engaged with being successful.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:15.520
And so this is not so much a strategy for
building audiences for our theaters of the

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.000
future at all.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.909
I am here because of my third grade teacher.

00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:26.970
Yes, my family cared about it and still do,
but my teachers were the most important people

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:30.490
in my life who brought me to this place.

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:37.480
And there's increasing scientific knowledge
that supports the idea that being engaged

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:42.840
with the arts helps with brain development
which then of course, leads to school success.

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:50.080
So, this really is a campaign that is so much
not about arts organizations, but people who

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:53.480
care about what it can do for young people.

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:58.759
And that's my not so secret goal is to have
every child be able to have access to arts

00:27:58.759 --> 00:27:59.999
education.

00:27:59.999 --> 00:28:02.260
So Orch Kids is the perfect example of this.

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:04.820
MARIN ALSOP: But, we see the kids.

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:11.549
We don't have the kind of funding to study
it in depth, but anecdotally, I see the kids

00:28:11.549 --> 00:28:18.399
growing, I see them developing, I see them
skills that they can apply to any discipline

00:28:18.399 --> 00:28:20.530
they select.

00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:23.809
And the goal isn't to make them all classical
musicians although I wouldn't mind that of

00:28:23.809 --> 00:28:24.809
course.

00:28:24.809 --> 00:28:29.330
But, the goal really is in 20 years when I
go to the doctor and she says, "oh yeah.

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:30.330
I remember you.

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:31.769
I was an Orch Kid."

00:28:31.769 --> 00:28:37.110
Or the mayor or the leaders of our community
because the important skills you develop are

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:39.029
the ones you need in every field.

00:28:39.029 --> 00:28:42.350
CARLA HAYDEN: It's called a discipline for
a reason.

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:46.330
DEBORAH RUTTER: It's about creativity, it's
about collaboration, innovation.

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:49.039
These are all skills for future workforce.

00:28:49.039 --> 00:28:51.950
MARIN ALSOP: And it's how they all feel about
themselves also.

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:56.110
I remember in math, you're either right or
wrong - it's a 50/50.

00:28:56.110 --> 00:29:04.669
But, if you play a violin, you're always right,
let me tell you.

00:29:04.669 --> 00:29:06.749
[laughter]
In my house maybe.

00:29:06.749 --> 00:29:13.500
DEBORAH RUTTER: There's a great example in
Chicago today, the Kenwood Academy which has

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:19.320
a really beautiful jazz program that has been
built and nurtured by someone who really loved

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:21.940
the school and the program there.

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:28.190
And with just a little bit of an extra boost
and attention, the school and the children

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:31.210
are so much more successful as a result of
this.

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:36.000
We did a project with them in Chicago and
Jason Moran, our artistic director for Jazz,

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:43.039
loved it so much that he reprised it and reprised
it and changed it based on his relationship

00:29:43.039 --> 00:29:47.649
with these kids and brought it 3 years later,
so it was the next generation of high school

00:29:47.649 --> 00:29:51.619
jazz band, to Washington to perform with him.

00:29:51.619 --> 00:29:57.460
And what this does for these children on the
Southside of Chicago is so powerful.

00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:01.000
CARLA HAYDEN: I know about Kenwood on the
Southside of Chicago.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.470
And the theater part and getting them involved.

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:10.929
MOLLY SMITH: My biggest fear of losing the
arts in school is that we lose innovation

00:30:10.929 --> 00:30:12.830
in every field.

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:20.830
That's our number one power, I think, as like
our American energy, that kind of entrepreneurship.

00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:25.700
Because what the arts teach you, has to do
with teamwork, ideas, imagination.

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:30.309
You know, the greatest freedom we have is
our imagination.

00:30:30.309 --> 00:30:35.860
And I don't think we are taught it in the
same way in the sciences, so that's why I

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:38.659
keep arguing for not STEM but STEAM.

00:30:38.659 --> 00:30:42.070
Let's put the power in it as well.

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:46.799
So, we reach about 20,000 young people at
Arena Stage every year.

00:30:46.799 --> 00:30:54.169
But, the one program I'd like to talk about
it is the "Voices of Now" which is ten different

00:30:54.169 --> 00:31:00.409
groups of young people who developed stories
from their lives over a 9 month period of

00:31:00.409 --> 00:31:05.009
time and then they are all produced at Arena
Stage and end up touring in different places

00:31:05.009 --> 00:31:06.009
as well.

00:31:06.009 --> 00:31:10.940
Now, anecdotally, we have a lot of information
about what happens to the young people after

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:15.730
this program, how many of them go on to college,
how many of them go on to graduate school,

00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:19.539
how many of them go on to great careers.

00:31:19.539 --> 00:31:22.249
Again, it's fantastic.

00:31:22.249 --> 00:31:29.230
That one on one relationship changes a young
person's life and so fighting for programming

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:34.110
in the schools, I think is very important
because what's happened, basically around

00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:39.600
the country is theaters and arts organizations
have taken up that banner and we're doing

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.700
the arts programs within our own organization.

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:46.940
CARLA HAYDEN: What about teacher education?

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:52.500
Helping teachers who might not have a formal
arts program do something?

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:57.139
DEBORAH RUTTER: Well, this is a big issue
because of course, so much needs to be done

00:31:57.139 --> 00:32:00.639
in the primary classroom and those teachers
are not experts.

00:32:00.639 --> 00:32:05.440
So, teaching artists are really critically
important and teaching artists are, come in

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:12.169
by contract to a school and they stand side
by side with a classroom teacher to help augment

00:32:12.169 --> 00:32:13.519
that training that happens.

00:32:13.519 --> 00:32:19.179
We, at the center have a pretty significant
one that we do in various parts of the country

00:32:19.179 --> 00:32:22.830
and we understand that teacher training is
really vital.

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:25.720
We work with teaching artists as well.

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:29.679
A program that we just brought on last fall
is called, "Turnaround Arts."

00:32:29.679 --> 00:32:34.820
It started out at the President's Committee
for arts and humanities and Michelle Obama

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:37.710
was sort of the champion for this program.

00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:44.250
And it was about using the arts to help turn
a low performing school into a higher performing

00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:45.250
school.

00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:47.090
So, it was beyond teaching arts education.

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:50.870
It was integrating art into the daily lives.

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:57.320
So, you learn multiplication tables by singing
or you would learn history by creating a play

00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:58.700
or acting.

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:06.019
And so we're in about 60, I think it's 60,
I keep inflating and I don't want to over

00:33:06.019 --> 00:33:11.509
inflate yet, but we're in a whole lot of low
performing schools across the country.

00:33:11.509 --> 00:33:15.070
I've only had it in the program for about
6 months now, so.

00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:20.539
But, it's a very exciting program because
we work by providing resources to the school,

00:33:20.539 --> 00:33:25.139
teaching artists into the school, training
for the school, the school as a whole, not

00:33:25.139 --> 00:33:30.059
just certain, in the classroom teachers.

00:33:30.059 --> 00:33:36.110
And then we pair them with celebrity artists
who actually make a point of going to the

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:40.470
school multiple times in a year to draw attention
to the school and build morale for it.

00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:45.239
Bit, it's fascinating because it's a different
approach that we as arts administrators have

00:33:45.239 --> 00:33:54.740
had because when arts programming started
getting cut 40 years ago or more, even longer

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:55.740
than that.

00:33:55.740 --> 00:34:01.580
We as arts institutions first got angry and
frustrated and kept saying, "well, it's the

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:06.269
school's responsibility, it's the government's
responsibility and we didn't at that time

00:34:06.269 --> 00:34:08.080
go in and say, "lets partner."

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:11.830
Now we have to partner because otherwise it
won't exist at all.

00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:16.139
So, sometimes our organizations are the only
ones providing that.

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:21.680
But, we are trying with Turnaround Arts, to
demonstrate that the use of the arts can actually

00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:23.080
help improve a school.

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:29.419
And through that case and getting the research
to support it, then we might be able to have

00:34:29.419 --> 00:34:30.619
a larger impact.

00:34:30.619 --> 00:34:35.820
CARLA HAYDEN: Haven't you been able to attract,
I know withy Orch Kids, philanthropy?

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:37.129
Arts philanthropy has increased.

00:34:37.129 --> 00:34:38.890
MARIN ALSOP: Yeah, of course.

00:34:38.890 --> 00:34:40.090
I think that.

00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:45.800
Well, there are a few things I'd love to say.

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:51.700
Something that is on my mind at least at the
moment is that I hope that the small amount

00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:58.900
of government support for the arts that we
now currently have, that everyone speaks out

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:03.040
to preserve the National Endowment for the
Arts.

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:12.300
It's a very very small token support of the
arts, but I think it's very important that

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:20.480
we insist that our leadership in the United
States of America, at least advocates for

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.410
the arts in some small measure.

00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:27.880
I mean, I work as musical director also in
Brazil at the Sao Paolo Symphony and I have

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:35.200
to say for Brazil where everything's in chaos
constantly there.

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:42.330
Yet, the leadership of the country believes
that art is a vehicle to promote tolerance

00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:50.890
and peace among people and so even when things
are cut, the arts are cut proportionally,

00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:52.820
not disproportionally.

00:35:52.820 --> 00:36:00.920
And that gives me pause to think that here
in South America, there in South America,

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:06.570
they could have this kind of visionary leadership,
whereas here in the United States where it's

00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:14.470
so integral to who we are, I believe as Americans,
it's all about the individual, the creative

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:20.220
power of entrepreneurship and that's what
we're all about, sort of fundamentally and

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:22.100
yet we're not supporting that.

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:23.830
It's not about the arts.

00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:26.130
You know, we make it sort of a siloed experience.

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:33.520
It's about creating people who are well balanced
and who have a vision.

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:34.810
I can think outside the box.

00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:37.860
Maybe that's the biggest thing the arts give
you.

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:41.110
You know, whether you ever go into the arts
or not.

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:46.480
And of course it's always a struggle in the
United States because we have to, we have

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:51.120
to build support- philanthropic support on
every level.

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:56.270
It's not just that you have a good idea, but
then you have to fund it and then you have

00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:57.610
to measure it.

00:36:57.610 --> 00:36:59.840
That's the part I struggle with.

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:00.840
Everything has to be measured here.

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:02.640
CARLA HAYDEN: Yes, what are the results?

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.950
MARIN ALSOP: Can we have the data?

00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:07.960
CARLA HYDEN: For the full human being.

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:08.960
How about that?

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:09.960
MARIN ALSOP: Yeah really.

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:10.960
Maybe just shake the kid's hand.

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:15.450
DEBORAH RUTTER: I have stood side by side
with this issue and the argument about data

00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:20.150
for a long time and have come to believe that
sometimes if you can demonstrate what really

00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:21.150
happened.

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:24.290
We certainly count the number of people who
have attended performances.

00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:27.760
We are counting the number of women enrolled
etcetera etcetera.

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:30.150
If we can see what the impact is.

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:34.540
The issue really is, we are always living
on a shoestring.

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:38.800
Because you always want to put more money
into the art, you don't really want to put

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:42.300
money into the things around it that might
support it in the long term.

00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:48.190
So, this issue of doing research and evaluation
and keeping track of it is one that we in

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:54.050
our field have really not done a great job
and as I've come to the Kennedy Center, we

00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:58.270
do more of for exactly the reasons that we've
been talking about.

00:37:58.270 --> 00:38:00.670
MARIN ALSOP: Well, you have that mandate.

00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:07.190
Do you find though, I think we've done a very
poor job also of educating the public as to

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:10.520
the financial benefit of arts.

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:18.390
You know, for every dollar spent in the arts,
it exponentially reaps results that are exponential

00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:23.890
to the investment and we haven't done a good
job of publicizing that and getting the message

00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:24.890
out to the public I don't think.

00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:27.070
CARLA HAYDEN: That seems like it would be
very strong with the public.

00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:32.640
DEBORAH RUTTER: Well, just earlier this week,
Darren at the Americans for the Arts program,

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:41.350
Bob Lynch spoke about the fact that 145 million
dollars of the NEA is worth some huge magnitude

00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:43.530
like 800 billion dollars.

00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:52.710
Not million, but billion dollars of economic
impact and so we're not, this is not a trivial

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:56.250
thing, what we're standing up for.

00:38:56.250 --> 00:39:00.530
If you can track what happens to a young person
who's involved with the arts and where they

00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:06.270
go, whether and how the arts have influenced
them, I think that can be something that is

00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:08.260
really important for us to be looking at.

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:15.050
I think the Americans for the Arts are doing
more of it, but we need to do it more as individual

00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:16.050
institutions.

00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:23.940
MOLLY SMITH: When Arena made the decision
to stay in Southwest Washington and rebuild,

00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:31.410
that whole program and the new Arena Stage
really became a catalyst for building in Southwest

00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:35.190
Washington, which has been seen as the forgotten
quadrant.

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:38.850
There are now 36 different developments that
are happening there.

00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:42.980
If you drive down in Southwest, you'll probably
see 15 cranes in the air.

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:46.010
Now, would that have happened without Arena?

00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:48.090
Probably in about 15 or 20 years.

00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:49.760
Did it get pushed by Arena?

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:50.760
Yes.

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:56.180
And we see that happening in communities all
over Washington DC and indeed all over the

00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:57.280
country.

00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:02.060
The arts are real drivers of economic expansion.

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:08.210
My fear about the loss of the NEA, the loss
of the NEH, the loss of all of our cultural

00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:16.090
programs, is what is really going to happen
in smaller rural areas as well as in cities.

00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:21.180
Because for smaller rural areas, that often
is the only money that they have to have the

00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:27.200
school program which is teaching young people
how to do puppetry or teaching young people

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:28.600
how to make plays.

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:30.320
That's it.

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:31.480
That's it.

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:36.740
You know, you go out to some place like Kotzebue
in Alaska and is that whole program going

00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:37.880
to be cut?

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:40.610
So, that really changes the equation.

00:40:40.610 --> 00:40:46.390
It's a narrowing of vision about the beauty
of who we are as Americans.

00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:50.940
And that's what I think the attack is and
that's why I think it's so important for all

00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:55.801
of us to get out pen and paper and write our
legislators and let people know because we

00:40:55.801 --> 00:40:57.610
know pressure works.

00:40:57.610 --> 00:40:58.610
It works.

00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:04.590
[applause]
CARLA HAYDEN: I Just got my time sign that

00:41:04.590 --> 00:41:13.340
we're going to open it up for a little Q and
A. But, I just wanted to do a little inside

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:14.930
scoop thing here.

00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:16.070
You can break some news.

00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:21.660
Do you have anything that you can share with
us that's coming up?

00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:23.040
This is YouTube, Facebook...

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:28.170
MOLLY SMITH: This is what we don't want anybody
else to know accept for the room, right?

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:29.710
CARLA HAYDEN: Of course.

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:32.440
Some upcoming projects that might be interesting.

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:34.060
You mentioned Lorraine Hansberry is coming.

00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:35.060
MOLLY SMITH: Yeah.

00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:37.230
Raisin in the Sun is coming to Arena Stage.

00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:42.022
But, I wanted to mention "Sovereignty" that's
coming to Arena next year.

00:41:42.022 --> 00:41:45.120
This is part of our "Power Plays" initiative.

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:51.060
We have 25 new plays and musicals that are
being commissioned by Arena Stage for each

00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:56.040
decade beginning in 1776 to the present decade.

00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:58.820
We've already commissioned 9 people.

00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:05.590
And one of them is Mary Katherine Nagle, native
American lawyer, activist lawyer, wonderful

00:42:05.590 --> 00:42:06.590
playwright.

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:07.810
Her play is "Sovereignty."

00:42:07.810 --> 00:42:15.270
It takes place both in 1830 with Andrew Jackson
and broken treaties and present day broken

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:20.400
treaties between the Cherokee nation and also
the United States government.

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:24.631
This is a story that hasn't been told and
that's one of the things that I love to do

00:42:24.631 --> 00:42:25.910
in the theater.

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:27.200
CARLA HAYDEN: Wow.

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:28.200
Deborah?

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:32.760
DEBORAH RUTTER: Well, you know as we sit in
this really amazing building and this beautiful

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:39.880
room, it seems as though many people know
so much about the history of our city, our

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:43.240
country, and the buildings in Washington,
DC.

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:46.010
But even I didn't own it the same way that
I do now.

00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:49.600
Which is that the Kennedy Center is the living
memorial to John F Kennedy.

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:51.390
There is no other memorial.

00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:57.720
There is a library and all of that, but this
is the memorial to John F Kennedy and you

00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:59.170
know, a lot of people didn't really...

00:42:59.170 --> 00:43:02.780
I knew it, but I didn't know it to live it.

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:10.350
And so, as we are on the countdown to what
would have been his 100th birthday on May

00:43:10.350 --> 00:43:16.590
29 of this year, we are really thinking about
our identity as it relates to both being a

00:43:16.590 --> 00:43:19.690
performing arts center and the living memorial
to JFK.

00:43:19.690 --> 00:43:25.770
And we're having just an extraordinary season
full of programming that's so easy to attribute

00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:32.210
to things that he stood for because not only
did he and his wife care so much about the

00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:38.280
arts and humanities, but the other things
that we attribute to him- courage, freedom,

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:39.280
justice.

00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:40.520
There's one...

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:44.270
Freedom, courage, justice, and gratitude.

00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:48.560
And we are building all of our programming
around it and there's sort of a culminating

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:51.120
week of activities at the Center.

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:53.680
All this has been announced, so it's not new
news.

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:54.680
CARLA HAYDEN: Oh shoot.

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:55.720
[laughter]
DEBORAH RUTTER: Other than the fact that,

00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:59.750
I don't know if everyone is paying attention
to it in quite the same way.

00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:01.120
We're bringing back open house.

00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:08.570
We're going to have a day of celebration for
JFK and it's really been affirming to have

00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:17.210
such a generous, articulate, inspiring man
to be the namesake of our space and I'm actually

00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:23.540
looking forward to an effort that will sort
of revitalize the memorial aspect itself,

00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:29.060
so that the Center will be a must visit location
the way the Library of Congress...

00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:30.440
CARLA HAYDEN: We're working on that.

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:34.270
DEBORAH RUTTER: is a must visit location for
all who visit our nation's capital.

00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:35.270
CARLA HAYDEN: We're working on that.

00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:37.210
I'll explain a little later.

00:44:37.210 --> 00:44:39.870
MARIN ALSOP: Well, I don't have any big secrets.

00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:41.390
CARLA HAYDEN: Oh Marin.

00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:43.670
MARIN ALSOP: I know, it's terrible.

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:50.740
But, for those of you who don't know the Baltimore
Symphony, all I can say is we're sort of the,

00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:52.380
we're the poor cousin up the road.

00:44:52.380 --> 00:45:01.020
But, the quality of our orchestra and the
level of passion and commitment from the musicians

00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:05.150
and the Baltimore Symphony, I think is really
unparalleled in the United States.

00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:10.990
I think it's one of the great, one of the
really great orchestras of the world.

00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:16.620
And I'd invite you to come and hear the orchestra
any time and it's nice as we're ramping up,

00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:21.780
also to 2018 which is the 100 anniversary
of Leonard Bernstein.

00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:26.590
And so, it's nice because we have that connection
also with the Kennedy Center because Bernstein

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:34.940
wrote his mass in honor of JFK, so there's
always that nice, that nice connection.

00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:41.510
And of course Bernstein inspired so many people
and as I said to start, was my hero, so we'll

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:44.520
be doing a lot of programming around that
of course.

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:49.280
CARLA HAYDEN: Well, I was saying and I said
I'll mention it later, but the Library of

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:51.710
Congress is connecting to all of you.

00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:52.740
We have his papers.

00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:54.780
We're going to be part of the celebration.

00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:59.010
Lorraine Hansberry, Lee Strasburg archives,
so we will be supplementing, complementing,

00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:06.280
and will be part of what you do.

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:09.230
And the Orch Kids are coming.

00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:10.710
MARIN ALSOP: The Orch Kids are going to come
and play here.

00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:12.350
CARLA HAYDEN: Right her in the Great Hall.

00:46:12.350 --> 00:46:14.790
So, we are just delighted.

00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:21.670
[applause]
So, we'd like to open it up for questions

00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:25.650
or comments and things you have.

00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:27.520
Talk about Women's History Month.

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:35.250
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Well, first of all thank
you very much for your very candid comments.

00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:41.320
In the course of the discussion up there,
the term, leadership was used at least several

00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:42.320
dozen times.

00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:50.010
So, and we have 4 very distinguished women
up there who have achieved significant leadership

00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:53.870
positions in their chosen professional path.

00:46:53.870 --> 00:47:03.530
So, my question is, can you talk a little
more about your personal leadership style

00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:12.330
and maybe a lesson or two about leadership
that you learned as you developed into a leader?

00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:15.870
CARLA HAYDEN: I'm looking at you guys first.

00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:19.410
DEBORAH RUTTER: Well, that's a really good
question.

00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:24.860
I will start only because these two have more
creative answers than I do.

00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:31.650
But, I do think that that's why there has
been an increasing number of women in managerial

00:47:31.650 --> 00:47:33.730
positions in the arts.

00:47:33.730 --> 00:47:39.470
And it's because I am a consensus builder
and I work on building teams.

00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:43.570
I'm not an autocrat who says, "this is the
way it's going to be.

00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:44.780
This is what I care about.

00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:47.010
This is only what we are going to do."

00:47:47.010 --> 00:47:55.200
And in fact, whenever I have a group of colleagues
who ask for that direction, I push back even

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:56.200
harder.

00:47:56.200 --> 00:48:01.610
I push my seat away from the table and I say,
"no, we are doing this together."

00:48:01.610 --> 00:48:08.370
Building that team who believe in where we're
going and how we're going to get there and

00:48:08.370 --> 00:48:11.620
that's the most rewarding aspect of it.

00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:17.390
Now, you go to a different city and you find
a new culture when you go into that organization

00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:23.720
and sometimes it takes a while to change from
one style to another.

00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:34.310
And I have never inherited a job from another
woman, so I build a different kind of an atmosphere

00:48:34.310 --> 00:48:41.510
in the organization and it's much more fun
and you get so much more done and there are

00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:47.890
so many more creative ideas that come out
of your institution when you can lead by building

00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:51.780
a team who all have a common vision.

00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:58.280
MOLLY SMITH: And I would say the most important
part of leadership is communication.

00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:05.400
Because the worst thing in the world is to
be a leader leading the band and there's no

00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:07.850
one behind you.

00:49:07.850 --> 00:49:15.270
And so it's all about communicating whatever
the particular vision is, whatever the particular

00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:16.780
idea is.

00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:22.840
And also recognizing that sometimes it take
a lot of time to make whatever that dream

00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:26.020
or that vision come true.

00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:32.780
When I came to Arena, I re-focused Arena on
American plays, American ideas and American

00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:33.780
artists.

00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:36.820
It had been much more of an international
company and American work before that time.

00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:41.520
It took 8 or 9 years to do that in a full
way.

00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:48.520
And it's really insuring that everybody who
is at the theater leads in their own way because

00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:51.050
people want to lead and people need to lead.

00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:53.310
They're their own experts.

00:49:53.310 --> 00:49:59.430
So, giving people the power to be able to
do that, I think is incredibly important in

00:49:59.430 --> 00:50:00.430
leadership roles.

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:04.170
MARIN ALSOP: Well, I agree with everything
you're saying.

00:50:04.170 --> 00:50:10.000
I think that being a good leader is being
a very good listener.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:18.030
I think collaborative leadership, trying to
nurture collaboration.

00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:26.570
But, I think at the end of the day as a leader,
you have to accept accountability, especially

00:50:26.570 --> 00:50:27.570
in an orchestra.

00:50:27.570 --> 00:50:29.600
It can't be a democracy.

00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:35.380
And so, ultimately, even though a lot of people
would like it to be.

00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:46.570
I think ultimately, from my perspective, just
a personal mantra is "I'd much rather be respected

00:50:46.570 --> 00:50:48.300
than liked."

00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:54.690
And often if they respect you long enough,
they end up liking you.

00:50:54.690 --> 00:50:56.530
That can't be one's motivation.

00:50:56.530 --> 00:51:02.710
I think sometimes leaders have to make the
hard decisions and stand alone for the good

00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:04.110
of the art.

00:51:04.110 --> 00:51:07.430
And if you always put your art first, you
can't go wrong.

00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:08.870
CARLA HAYDEN: That's wonderful.

00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:18.840
Just on a side note, as a leader and as a
woman, making sure that there's a safety net

00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:26.120
for making mistakes and that you as a leader
can reveal that you make mistakes, that you

00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:28.690
do things and it's ok.

00:51:28.690 --> 00:51:32.350
Creating that safety net.

00:51:32.350 --> 00:51:35.320
Another one.

00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:39.540
And wasn't it funny how I said, "You guys."?

00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:42.840
[laughter]
As soon as I said it, I said, "ok, Women's

00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:43.930
History Month."

00:51:43.930 --> 00:51:53.930
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I applaud each of you and
I hear a lot about children and I am a substitute

00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:57.400
teacher and an artist and a senior citizen.

00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:01.680
And what I want to know is, where do you see
our place in the arts?

00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:07.340
As I hold up my card as being a senior citizen.

00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:17.180
CARLA HAYDEN: Well, I just told Marin about
a lady who she knew, Netty Taylor, who just

00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:23.340
passed away recently at 102 and her greatest
joy was bringing young people to the BSO,

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:28.760
the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra and being
that person, even with the wheel chair, everything.

00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:34.240
Netty Taylor would sit there and make sure
that she was part of that.

00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:42.930
MARIN ALSOP: So, don't you think we could
do a lot more with seniors and getting them

00:52:42.930 --> 00:52:44.380
involved?

00:52:44.380 --> 00:52:45.820
Especially...

00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:51.490
One of my dreams is for our Orch Kids program
is to offer our retired musicians who have

00:52:51.490 --> 00:52:59.770
this unbelievable wealth of knowledge, a post-orchestra
career working with the Orch Kids and putting

00:52:59.770 --> 00:53:02.510
a whole training program into place.

00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:09.840
I think that when I look at many of our volunteers,
are older people who are involved with the

00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:14.130
kids and they're so devoted and dedicated.

00:53:14.130 --> 00:53:22.040
And they also come with this lifetime of experience
and knowledge.

00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:28.680
So, I think we can offer more because I think
it's a resource that we're not taking advantage

00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:30.720
of as we could.

00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:39.630
DEBORAH RUTTER: You know, if you think about
the work that's often done by corporations,

00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:44.020
sort of searching after the 18 to 24 year
old.

00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:49.990
And I have spent all of my career sort of
scratching my head about why are we always

00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:51.620
talking about wanting younger audiences?

00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:56.570
Part of the reason we're looking for younger
audiences is because we're all aging and we're

00:53:56.570 --> 00:54:01.230
all aging into being seniors and we're all
aging into that time in our life when we actually

00:54:01.230 --> 00:54:03.360
have more time to do other things.

00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:06.930
We need to make sure that you have young people
coming in.

00:54:06.930 --> 00:54:13.520
And it's about making the connection throughout
life, whether it is the youngest person to

00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:20.730
the senior or seniors then helping young people
come into the arts and having that experience.

00:54:20.730 --> 00:54:30.221
And I think that as I experience with my own
family and with my own organization, we're

00:54:30.221 --> 00:54:37.920
thinking more about the programs that we're
offering to audiences of all ages and understanding

00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:45.410
in fact that music and dance and theater can
be even more important as you age and it's

00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:51.300
not just because you have more time, but actually
it is a part of what happens in your whole

00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:56.440
physical cycle and your brain and keeping
yourself healthy.

00:54:56.440 --> 00:55:02.310
So, this is actually something that I've been
thinking about, not at a fully formed idea

00:55:02.310 --> 00:55:08.570
yet, but other than the fact that I see that
some of the most active people in my life

00:55:08.570 --> 00:55:14.720
both at work and at home, are the ones who
are working and active and engaged still.

00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:22.580
And those are the ones who are docents and
helping out as teaching assistants for our

00:55:22.580 --> 00:55:23.680
education programs.

00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:29.500
But, I've really come to think that developing
some programs that are sort of health and

00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:35.590
wellness programs for people of all ages and
seniors in particular, would be something

00:55:35.590 --> 00:55:37.700
that would be a great way for us to benefit
from.

00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:42.690
But, this is also something that we don't
always know a lot about because we're dealing

00:55:42.690 --> 00:55:43.690
with...

00:55:43.690 --> 00:55:47.500
We're our own age, we're thinking about bringing
young people in.

00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:55.160
So, it's an area that I think as our population
ages, as there's a larger population that

00:55:55.160 --> 00:56:00.760
is of a different age, we can think about
the role that we are, in terms of providing

00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:06.540
services, whether active participatory ones
or as patrons.

00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:11.570
So, it's a wonderful question and it's one
that happens to be sort of resonant for me

00:56:11.570 --> 00:56:13.540
right now as we are doing some work.

00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:18.220
Actually, I will tell you a secret which is
that we're doing a program that hasn't really

00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:24.210
been out there too much yet with the National
Institutes of Health.

00:56:24.210 --> 00:56:31.260
And it's around health and wellness and music
and the brain and we're looking at how music

00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:35.840
has an impact on young kids and what it can
do for music therapy.

00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:39.260
We talked about that and then all the way
through creative aging.

00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:44.790
So, it's something that is really on the top
of mind right now.

00:56:44.790 --> 00:56:46.150
CARLA HAYDEN: Creative aging.

00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:47.150
DEBORAH RUTTER: Creative aging.

00:56:47.150 --> 00:56:48.150
Think about it.

00:56:48.150 --> 00:56:51.120
CARLA HAYDEN: I think we need that.

00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:52.730
Another question.

00:56:52.730 --> 00:56:55.150
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi.

00:56:55.150 --> 00:56:59.540
I work here at the Library and if I had more
time, I'd talk about the author named Marguerite

00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:05.200
De Angeli that influenced both Dr. Hayden
and actually me in going into a career writing

00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:11.080
about Quakers, which is just an aside to say
I ended up getting a PhD in American Studies.

00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:15.640
But, had you asked me at the same age about
10 or 12 years old who I wanted to be when

00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:18.770
I grew up, it would have been Leonard Bernstein.

00:57:18.770 --> 00:57:19.770
Bernsteen.

00:57:19.770 --> 00:57:20.770
Bernstein.

00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:21.770
MARIN ALSOP: Bernstein, your right.

00:57:21.770 --> 00:57:22.770
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Bernstein.

00:57:22.770 --> 00:57:25.470
Sorry, my cousins are Bernsteen, he's Bernstein.

00:57:25.470 --> 00:57:31.050
And the height of my conducting career was
to conduct the high school orchestra for one

00:57:31.050 --> 00:57:33.090
piece in my senior year.

00:57:33.090 --> 00:57:39.270
My question is about talent in the arts or
the idea of talent which I think as I look

00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:45.520
back, I don't know how much talent I did or
didn't have, but at a certain point, it didn't

00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:49.550
seem to me that I had the talent to be an
orchestral conductor and I went in other directions.

00:57:49.550 --> 00:57:51.760
I also play the violin, by the way.

00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:58.090
But, I think that at the time, there were
senses of role models for women in those ways

00:57:58.090 --> 00:58:00.810
and I heard you all talk about mentorship.

00:58:00.810 --> 00:58:07.980
But, I don't actually know the answer for
where talent versus- so it's a nature nurture

00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:08.980
kind of question I guess.

00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:11.700
If you can talk about that a little more because
it's a big deal in the arts.

00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:12.700
It seems to me.

00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:18.550
CARLA HAYDEN: And before you start, I'm laughing
because I'm the product of two classically

00:58:18.550 --> 00:58:21.950
trained musicians and I'm sitting here as
a librarian.

00:58:21.950 --> 00:58:26.640
So, that tells you my talent and why this
is so important.

00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:29.670
A violinist and a pianist, so talent does...

00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:31.020
MARIN ALSOP: I don't know.

00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:37.290
Maybe I have some very idealistic view of
talent.

00:58:37.290 --> 00:58:46.160
I think, also I think the word, creativity
is often restricted to people who have chosen

00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:48.660
the arts as their discipline.

00:58:48.660 --> 00:58:57.850
Whereas, I think that creativity is inherent
in being human.

00:58:57.850 --> 00:59:04.370
When people tell me they're tone deaf or something
like that, I think that's simply not possible.

00:59:04.370 --> 00:59:08.830
You know someone told you that and you started
taking that on.

00:59:08.830 --> 00:59:10.470
Or you can't draw.

00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:16.000
I was told, "you're terrible at that," so
I always thought, "I have no talent for that."

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.640
But, instead if someone had said, "well, let's
see.

00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:20.750
Let me help you a little bit.

00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:21.750
Oh that's nice."

00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:24.670
It's all about mentorship I think and encouragement.

00:59:24.670 --> 00:59:30.920
The thing I like about the Orch Kids program,
it's not targeting talented kids.

00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:32.540
It's democratic.

00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:34.650
I believe everyone is talented.

00:59:34.650 --> 00:59:41.200
I believe that had that been a passion for
you and someone had encouraged you, you could

00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:44.440
do what I'm doing now.

00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:51.000
For me, it's all about opportunity and exposure
and every kid I find...

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.650
I became a parent very late in life.

00:59:53.650 --> 01:00:00.600
I was amazed at what my kid could do, but
it was only because I had... my expectations

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:02.270
were this high.

01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:07.860
So, when I started with the Orch Kids, my
expectations were also this high and then

01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:13.160
immediately, the kids go to wherever you put
the bar and higher.

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:18.730
I think every child is born with enormous
talent and genius and we just gradually suck

01:00:18.730 --> 01:00:20.200
it out of them.

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:24.510
(laughter) And that's what we can't afford
to do.

01:00:24.510 --> 01:00:30.730
So, maybe I'm very idealistic about this,
but I believe you have the talent that I have.

01:00:30.730 --> 01:00:37.740
DEBORAH RUTTER: I have a couple of different
stories of circumstances where a really influential

01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:46.650
teacher or conductor would actually say to
and gave examples where hard work is actually

01:00:46.650 --> 01:00:49.440
more important than talent.

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:55.520
Because somebody who has raw talent may coast
without the hard work.

01:00:55.520 --> 01:01:02.450
So, the people who we see as genius are using
raw talent and then working really hard at

01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:03.490
it.

01:01:03.490 --> 01:01:08.310
And so that's why I would always encourage
to stick with it.

01:01:08.310 --> 01:01:11.660
My problem was I didn't want to be alone in
a practice room.

01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:12.660
MARIN ALSOP: Right.

01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:14.700
It's whether you have the personality to endure
it.

01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:15.700
I think.

01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:16.700
DEBORAH RUTTER: Exactly.

01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:17.700
Exactly.

01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:26.310
But, I love it like crazy and I dedicate enormous
amounts of my time in a different way really

01:01:26.310 --> 01:01:28.490
supporting it and experiencing it.

01:01:28.490 --> 01:01:32.080
So, it's really about how you spend your time.

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:35.770
So, absolutely, you could have been a conductor.

01:01:35.770 --> 01:01:38.210
There's a long path to travel, but.

01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:40.670
MOLLY SMITH: And I would totally agree.

01:01:40.670 --> 01:01:45.430
I think that there's like 5 or 10 % talent
because everybody has talent and the rest

01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:54.770
of it is perseverance, persistence, gutsiness,
aggressive, pushing through all of the rejection

01:01:54.770 --> 01:01:57.700
and being able to say, "no, I can still do
this."

01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:00.760
But, that also has to do with self-image,
you know?

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:04.380
The people around you supporting you, saying,
"You can do it.

01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:05.380
You can do it."

01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:13.510
And that's one of the most important things
that we can give to young people and adults

01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:21.150
as well because I believe in lifelong education,
that curiosity is through an entire life.

01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:26.600
And even if you don't think you have the talent
to do this thing, just try.

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:27.600
Just try.

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:28.600
Go out and do it.

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:30.230
It's amazing what it will open up.

01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:36.150
CARLA HAYDEN: And to be able to recognize
it and that's sometimes the part that's really

01:02:36.150 --> 01:02:41.430
gripping when you know that young people might
not have the opportunity to have their particular

01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:44.250
talent recognized at an early enough stage.

01:02:44.250 --> 01:02:48.810
Maybe you're not good at drawing, but there's
a child over there that's singing all the

01:02:48.810 --> 01:02:49.810
time.

01:02:49.810 --> 01:02:50.810
This one is doing that.

01:02:50.810 --> 01:02:57.900
The greatest gift my parents gave me was at
12 we all agreed that when they looked at

01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:05.420
musical notes, they heard music and when I
looked at text, I heard words.

01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:06.870
And that was ok.

01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:11.870
And then I went off with words and appreciated
it.

01:03:11.870 --> 01:03:13.700
But, to know.

01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:18.810
Sometimes you drive in neighborhoods and you
look on corners and you see people and you

01:03:18.810 --> 01:03:23.720
say wow, when did the light go out in their
eyes?

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:27.340
When was that 4 year old not given that chance
to do that and here they are.

01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:29.820
DEBORAH RUTTER: That's the spiral that is
so difficult.

01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:34.640
That if you get into that, if you are caught
somewhere in that spiral and you don't have

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:36.730
the network that can give it to you.

01:03:36.730 --> 01:03:42.020
So, it has to come from teachers, it has to
come from community leaders, it has to come

01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:45.890
from somebody if it can't come from your parents
and mentors.

01:03:45.890 --> 01:03:49.850
And that's why we have to have a network that
supports people.

01:03:49.850 --> 01:03:51.340
CARLA HAYDEN: Right.

01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:59.910
I think we have time for one more question
or comment and to really in this celebration

01:03:59.910 --> 01:04:02.920
of Women's History Month, I can't thank you
all enough.

01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:07.620
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I wanted to echo everyone
else and just saying thank you all so much

01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:12.160
for coming out and sharing your experiences
for this event.

01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:16.990
My question is as women of power, how do you
all weave the concept of intersectionality

01:04:16.990 --> 01:04:22.480
into your organizations in regard to hiring
or promoting or just generally creating a

01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:29.080
pipeline so that arts leadership may be more
inclusive to women of color?

01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:37.220
DEBORAH RUTTER: Well, first of all you have
to have, you have to be very explicit in saying

01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:44.790
this is a priority and having broad ownership,
because if just one person owns it, it won't,

01:04:44.790 --> 01:04:46.530
it can't succeed.

01:04:46.530 --> 01:04:51.530
But, if you can get broad ownership throughout
your institution.

01:04:51.530 --> 01:04:58.060
In my case, it was extremely helpful that
the board was right there with me.

01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:05.040
If not perhaps ahead of me when I came to
the Center and therefore putting the structure

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:06.040
in place.

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:08.880
It does though mean that you have to put mandates
in place.

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:16.990
And so for us now, there can never be a final
candidate pool that doesn't have diversity

01:05:16.990 --> 01:05:18.800
in the pool.

01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:23.910
And a conversation that always takes place
both from the hiring people.

01:05:23.910 --> 01:05:28.970
Now I'm lucky because I have an institution
that has really great reach and I want to

01:05:28.970 --> 01:05:36.590
use the size and the reach of this institution
to help build as many future leaders as possible.

01:05:36.590 --> 01:05:39.780
But, I believe it can happen in any kind of
organization.

01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:43.430
It has to be something that you believe as
a core value.

01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:47.240
And you have to have the whole team doing
the same thing.

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:49.640
Because the one person isn't doing all of
the hiring.

01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:55.490
There are a lot of people doing the hiring,
but I think that Molly's given a great description

01:05:55.490 --> 01:05:57.680
because there are jobs everywhere.

01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:02.530
It's not just in sort of the administrative
aspect of it.

01:06:02.530 --> 01:06:07.560
There are jobs throughout our buildings that
are supporting the arts and are a way into

01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:11.900
our organization
MARIN ALSOP: We're looking also to trying

01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:15.520
to create diversity on our board of directors.

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:21.660
I'm sure everyone, the good thing is that
it's an open conversation now and I think

01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:27.010
there is an awareness of the dearth of diversity
throughout our field.

01:06:27.010 --> 01:06:33.090
So, I think that's exciting because people
are willing to have the conversation and really

01:06:33.090 --> 01:06:36.680
try to at least change the landscape to a
certain degree.

01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:41.010
MOLLY SMITH: We look at it holistically at
Arena Stage.

01:06:41.010 --> 01:06:46.640
When I came to Arena, our audience was not
diverse so I walked the streets of Washington,

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:47.640
DC.

01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:50.580
I went into the churches in Washington, DC.

01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:55.720
I went into some of the Baptist churches and
of course Washington DC is a black and white

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:56.720
city.

01:06:56.720 --> 01:07:03.240
And there was programming that we had on stage
that really focused on the African American

01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:05.620
experience, but our audiences didn't reflect
that.

01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:11.940
And this is unusual because Arena started
as the first integrated theater in Washington,

01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:14.220
DC 68 years ago.

01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:18.350
And so it's in our bloodlines, the importance
of this.

01:07:18.350 --> 01:07:25.050
And so I realized it all happens through programming
and so about a third to half of the work that

01:07:25.050 --> 01:07:28.530
we do every year is around people of color.

01:07:28.530 --> 01:07:33.250
When I was in the Baptist churches, I saw
the way in which people welcomed people is

01:07:33.250 --> 01:07:38.780
they would stand outside the door and shake
hands with people all the way into the church.

01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:40.740
So, we changed our usher structure.

01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:44.580
So, there are people all the way through the
theater saying, "welcome, come in."

01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:49.410
We have people all the way outside because
theaters tend to be places where people are

01:07:49.410 --> 01:07:51.400
a little bit nervous coming in.

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:58.860
And so eventually, now almost 30% of our audience
are people of color.

01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:05.560
That's one of the most diverse in the United
States - one of the top ones in theaters.

01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:09.020
And that's something that we work on on a
daily basis.

01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:11.320
Our staff is diverse.

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:13.270
Our programming is diverse.

01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:15.960
Our board is becoming more diverse.

01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:21.390
We have a wonderful chairman, Judith Batty
who's African American.

01:08:21.390 --> 01:08:26.520
And we just keep working at it and as you
said Marin, it's moment by moment, it's day

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:27.520
by day.

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:31.860
It's doing exactly what Deborah says, which
is when we have a pool of people, what we're

01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:38.359
looking at for a particular position, there
has to be a person of color within that pool

01:08:38.359 --> 01:08:41.359
who can get the job, right?

01:08:41.359 --> 01:08:43.839
It can't just be, "well, we can't find anybody."

01:08:43.839 --> 01:08:46.620
Go out again, keep looking.

01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:52.159
And so that's where we as administrators need
to keep our own feet in the fire.

01:08:52.159 --> 01:08:58.500
CARLA HAYDEN: I can't thank you all enough
because even though, and all of you that are

01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:05.159
here today, because this is Women's History
Month, but women's history is all year round.

01:09:05.159 --> 01:09:07.150
And I just thank you so much.

01:09:07.150 --> 01:09:09.660
DEBORAH RUTTER: We're so proud of you, Carla.

01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:09.969
