00:00:08.113 --> 00:00:12.245
In 1800, the explorer 
Alexander von Humboldt

00:00:12.245 --> 00:00:16.234
witnessed a swarm of electric eels
leap out of the water

00:00:16.234 --> 00:00:19.834
to defend themselves 
against oncoming horses.

00:00:19.834 --> 00:00:24.435
Most people thought the story
so unusual that Humboldt made it up.

00:00:24.435 --> 00:00:28.796
But fish using electricity is more common
than you might think;

00:00:28.796 --> 00:00:32.935
and yes, electric eels are a type of fish.

00:00:32.935 --> 00:00:35.125
Underwater, where light is scarce,

00:00:35.125 --> 00:00:37.774
electrical signals offer ways
to communicate,

00:00:37.774 --> 00:00:38.861
navigate,

00:00:38.861 --> 00:00:43.692
and find—plus, in rare cases, stun—prey.

00:00:43.692 --> 00:00:49.135
Nearly 350 species of fish
have specialized anatomical structures

00:00:49.135 --> 00:00:52.807
that generate 
and detect electrical signals.

00:00:52.807 --> 00:00:55.246
These fish are divided into two groups,

00:00:55.246 --> 00:00:58.608
depending on how much 
electricity they produce.

00:00:58.608 --> 00:01:03.587
Scientists call the first group
the weakly electric fish.

00:01:03.587 --> 00:01:06.406
Structures near their tails 
called electric organs

00:01:06.406 --> 00:01:12.507
produce up to a volt of electricity,
about two-thirds as much as a AA battery.

00:01:12.507 --> 00:01:14.597
How does this work?

00:01:14.597 --> 00:01:19.068
The fish's brain sends a signal through
its nervous system to the electric organ,

00:01:19.068 --> 00:01:21.288
which is filled with stacks of hundreds

00:01:21.288 --> 00:01:27.258
or thousands of disc-shaped 
cells called electrocytes.

00:01:27.258 --> 00:01:31.438
Normally, electrocytes pump out sodium
and potassium ions

00:01:31.438 --> 00:01:36.807
to maintain a positive charge outside
and negative charge inside.

00:01:36.807 --> 00:01:39.920
But when the nerve signal arrives
at the electrocyte,

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.549
it prompts the ion gates to open.

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.709
Positively charged ions flow back in.

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:52.029
Now, one face of the electrocyte
is negatively charged outside

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:54.699
and positively charged inside.

00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:58.771
But the far side 
has the opposite charge pattern.

00:01:58.771 --> 00:02:01.420
These alternating charges 
can drive a current,

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.491
turning the electrocyte 
into a biological battery.

00:02:06.491 --> 00:02:10.649
The key to these fish's powers 
is that nerve signals are coordinated

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.031
to arrive at each cell 
at exactly the same time.

00:02:15.031 --> 00:02:21.080
That makes the stacks of electrocytes
act like thousands of batteries in series.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.323
The tiny charges from each one
add up to an electrical field

00:02:24.323 --> 00:02:27.061
that can travel several meters.

00:02:27.061 --> 00:02:30.140
Cells called electroreceptors
buried in the skin

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.121
allow the fish to constantly sense
this field

00:02:33.121 --> 00:02:38.022
and the changes to it caused 
by the surroundings or other fish.

00:02:38.022 --> 00:02:40.492
The Peter’s elephantnose fish, 
for example,

00:02:40.492 --> 00:02:43.673
has an elongated chin
called a schnauzenorgan

00:02:43.673 --> 00:02:46.103
that's riddled in electroreceptors.

00:02:46.103 --> 00:02:48.892
That allows it to intercept signals
from other fish,

00:02:48.892 --> 00:02:50.792
judge distances,

00:02:50.792 --> 00:02:53.793
detect the shape and size
of nearby objects,

00:02:53.793 --> 00:02:58.801
and even determine whether
a buried insect is dead or alive.

00:02:58.801 --> 00:03:01.302
But the elephantnose
and other weakly electric fish

00:03:01.302 --> 00:03:05.402
don't produce enough electricity
to attack their prey.

00:03:05.402 --> 00:03:08.573
That ability belongs 
to the strongly electric fish,

00:03:08.573 --> 00:03:11.794
of which there are only 
a handful of species.

00:03:11.794 --> 00:03:16.392
The most powerful strongly electric
fish is the electric knife fish,

00:03:16.392 --> 00:03:20.513
more commonly known as the electric eel.

00:03:20.513 --> 00:03:25.400
Three electric organs span
almost its entire two-meter body.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.354
Like the weakly electric fish,

00:03:27.354 --> 00:03:30.960
the electric eel uses its signals
to navigate and communicate,

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.684
but it reserves its strongest 
electric discharges for hunting

00:03:34.684 --> 00:03:40.273
using a two-phased attack that susses out
and then incapacitates its prey.

00:03:40.273 --> 00:03:43.995
First, it emits two 
or three strong pulses,

00:03:43.995 --> 00:03:46.444
as much as 600 volts.

00:03:46.444 --> 00:03:49.734
These stimulate the prey's muscles,
sending it into spasms

00:03:49.734 --> 00:03:53.045
and generating waves 
that reveal its hiding place.

00:03:53.045 --> 00:03:55.925
Then, a volley of fast, 
high-voltage discharges

00:03:55.925 --> 00:03:59.294
causes even more intense 
muscle contractions.

00:03:59.294 --> 00:04:03.095
The electric eel can also curl up
so that the electric fields

00:04:03.095 --> 00:04:07.249
generated at each end 
of the electric organ overlap.

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:10.939
The electrical storm eventually
exhausts and immobilizes the prey,

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:14.890
and the electric eel 
can swallow its meal alive.

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.550
The other two strongly electric fish
are the electric catfish,

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.935
which can unleash 350 volts

00:04:20.935 --> 00:04:23.906
with an electric organ 
that occupies most of its torso,

00:04:23.906 --> 00:04:29.466
and the electric ray, with kidney-shaped
electric organs on either side of its head

00:04:29.466 --> 00:04:32.846
that produce as much as 220 volts.

00:04:32.846 --> 00:04:35.718
There is one mystery in the world
of electric fish:

00:04:35.718 --> 00:04:39.436
why don't they electrocute themselves?

00:04:39.436 --> 00:04:42.148
It may be that the size 
of strongly electric fish

00:04:42.148 --> 00:04:44.797
allows them to withstand their own shocks,

00:04:44.797 --> 00:04:48.465
or that the current passes out 
of their bodies too quickly.

00:04:48.465 --> 00:04:53.047
Some scientists think that special 
proteins may shield the electric organs,

00:04:53.047 --> 00:04:57.957
but the truth is, this is one mystery 
science still hasn't illuminated.
