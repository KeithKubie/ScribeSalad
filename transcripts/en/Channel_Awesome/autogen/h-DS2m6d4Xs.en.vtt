essentially right now you're an

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 align:start position:0%
airbender and you're trying to master
 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.200 align:start position:0%
airbender and you're trying to master
these<00:01:45.329><c> other</c><00:01:45.570><c> elements</c><00:01:46.170><c> but</c><00:01:46.979><c> earth</c><00:01:47.490><c> is</c><00:01:47.820><c> the</c>

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 align:start position:0%
these other elements but earth is the
 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.969 align:start position:0%
these other elements but earth is the

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 align:start position:0%
natural opposite so this is going to be
 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
natural opposite so this is going to be

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
airbending is very much about peace and
 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.679 align:start position:0%
airbending is very much about peace and

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 align:start position:0%
mighty force so I like that I thought

mighty force so I like that I thought
that<00:02:11.640><c> that</c><00:02:11.849><c> was</c><00:02:11.970><c> a</c><00:02:12.030><c> good</c><00:02:12.180><c> setup</c>

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 align:start position:0%
that that was a good setup
 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.619 align:start position:0%
that that was a good setup
you<00:02:13.239><c> get</c><00:02:13.510><c> a</c><00:02:14.190><c> little</c><00:02:15.190><c> bit</c><00:02:15.370><c> more</c><00:02:15.519><c> of</c><00:02:15.790><c> Zuko</c><00:02:16.239><c> trying</c>

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 align:start position:0%
you get a little bit more of Zuko trying
 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:20.220 align:start position:0%
you get a little bit more of Zuko trying

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 align:start position:0%
to come to grips with his pass obviously
 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.330 align:start position:0%

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 align:start position:0%
flashbacks you get a little bit of the
 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.250 align:start position:0%
flashbacks you get a little bit of the
uncle<00:02:23.290><c> um</c><00:02:24.390><c> I'm</c><00:02:25.390><c> assuming</c><00:02:25.930><c> they're</c><00:02:26.050><c> going</c><00:02:26.200><c> to</c>

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 align:start position:0%
uncle um I'm assuming they're going to
 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.759 align:start position:0%
uncle um I'm assuming they're going to
go<00:02:26.349><c> more</c><00:02:26.590><c> to</c><00:02:26.739><c> the</c><00:02:26.830><c> hem</c><00:02:26.920><c> later</c><00:02:27.129><c> obviously</c><00:02:27.819><c> but</c>

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 align:start position:0%
go more to the hem later obviously but
 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.050 align:start position:0%
go more to the hem later obviously but
that's<00:02:29.769><c> about</c><00:02:29.950><c> it</c><00:02:30.099><c> for</c><00:02:30.190><c> the</c><00:02:30.280><c> flashbacks</c><00:02:30.819><c> most</c>

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 align:start position:0%
that's about it for the flashbacks most
 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.660 align:start position:0%
that's about it for the flashbacks most
of<00:02:31.209><c> it</c><00:02:31.330><c> is</c><00:02:31.450><c> just</c><00:02:31.750><c> the</c><00:02:32.370><c> technique</c><00:02:33.370><c> and</c><00:02:33.580><c> the</c>

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 align:start position:0%
of it is just the technique and the
 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.460 align:start position:0%
of it is just the technique and the
philosophy<00:02:34.239><c> of</c><00:02:34.269><c> the</c><00:02:34.450><c> technique</c><00:02:34.870><c> which</c><00:02:35.319><c> is</c>

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 align:start position:0%
philosophy of the technique which is
 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.039 align:start position:0%
philosophy of the technique which is
good<00:02:35.650><c> you</c><00:02:36.099><c> know</c><00:02:36.129><c> it's</c><00:02:36.569><c> with</c><00:02:37.569><c> some</c><00:02:37.810><c> of</c><00:02:37.959><c> this</c>

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 align:start position:0%
good you know it's with some of this
 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
good you know it's with some of this
like<00:02:38.459><c> with</c><00:02:39.459><c> learning</c><00:02:40.030><c> the</c><00:02:40.180><c> waterbending</c><00:02:41.049><c> from</c>

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 align:start position:0%
like with learning the waterbending from
 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.380 align:start position:0%
like with learning the waterbending from
Katara<00:02:41.709><c> you</c><00:02:42.010><c> see</c><00:02:42.190><c> or</c><00:02:42.340><c> Cersei</c><00:02:42.700><c> okay</c><00:02:42.970><c> now</c><00:02:43.180><c> this</c>

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 align:start position:0%
Katara you see or Cersei okay now this
 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.509 align:start position:0%
Katara you see or Cersei okay now this
is<00:02:43.629><c> a</c><00:02:43.660><c> technique</c><00:02:44.049><c> this</c><00:02:44.709><c> is</c><00:02:44.890><c> that</c><00:02:45.040><c> there</c><00:02:45.190><c> wasn't</c>

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 align:start position:0%
is a technique this is that there wasn't
 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.030 align:start position:0%
is a technique this is that there wasn't
really<00:02:45.640><c> anything</c><00:02:46.030><c> it</c><00:02:46.959><c> was</c><00:02:47.140><c> more</c><00:02:47.349><c> motions</c><00:02:47.890><c> it</c>

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 align:start position:0%
really anything it was more motions it
 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.759 align:start position:0%
really anything it was more motions it
wasn't<00:02:48.430><c> as</c><00:02:48.549><c> much</c><00:02:48.849><c> the</c><00:02:49.750><c> mindset</c><00:02:50.440><c> or</c><00:02:50.620><c> the</c>

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 align:start position:0%
wasn't as much the mindset or the
 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't as much the mindset or the
philosophy<00:02:51.040><c> of</c><00:02:51.519><c> the</c><00:02:51.760><c> technique</c><00:02:52.180><c> so</c><00:02:52.209><c> I</c><00:02:52.420><c> like</c>

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 align:start position:0%
philosophy of the technique so I like
 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.270 align:start position:0%
philosophy of the technique so I like
their<00:02:52.840><c> going</c><00:02:53.110><c> more</c><00:02:53.290><c> and</c><00:02:53.410><c> more</c><00:02:53.530><c> into</c><00:02:53.799><c> that</c><00:02:53.950><c> they</c>

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 align:start position:0%
their going more and more into that they
 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.339 align:start position:0%
their going more and more into that they
dealt<00:02:54.640><c> a</c><00:02:54.760><c> little</c><00:02:55.150><c> bit</c><00:02:55.329><c> with</c><00:02:55.480><c> it</c><00:02:55.660><c> when</c><00:02:56.110><c> he</c><00:02:56.230><c> was</c>

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 align:start position:0%
dealt a little bit with it when he was
 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.740 align:start position:0%
dealt a little bit with it when he was
trying<00:02:56.530><c> to</c><00:02:56.590><c> learn</c><00:02:56.709><c> firebending</c><00:02:57.450><c> but</c><00:02:58.450><c> I</c><00:02:58.480><c> like</c>

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 align:start position:0%
trying to learn firebending but I like
 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
trying to learn firebending but I like
they<00:02:58.930><c> really</c><00:02:59.230><c> dive</c><00:02:59.500><c> much</c><00:02:59.739><c> more</c><00:02:59.950><c> into</c><00:03:00.220><c> it</c><00:03:00.250><c> with</c>

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 align:start position:0%
they really dive much more into it with
 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
they really dive much more into it with
this<00:03:01.360><c> and</c><00:03:01.629><c> I</c><00:03:01.720><c> like</c><00:03:01.989><c> the</c><00:03:02.200><c> idea</c><00:03:02.620><c> I</c><00:03:03.010><c> think</c><00:03:03.459><c> people</c>

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 align:start position:0%
