00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.700
<v 1>in case you've been hiding under a rock or if you just don't have Twitter,</v>

3
00:00:07.701 --> 00:00:08.481
bless your heart.

4
00:00:08.481 --> 00:00:12.350
Kanye West made is returned to the platform and proceeded to crack the Internet

5
00:00:12.351 --> 00:00:15.770
with seven dirty words,
which would have put even George Carlin to shame.

6
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.570
Last Saturday,
Kanye tweeted,
I love the way Candace Owens thinks.

7
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.040
If you don't know Candice,
Oh,

8
00:00:22.041 --> 00:00:25.430
and she's a black conservative woman who originally went under the youtube

9
00:00:25.431 --> 00:00:26.390
moniker,
red pill,

10
00:00:26.391 --> 00:00:31.391
black Candice caught fire online around the summer of 2017 and my interview with

11
00:00:31.461 --> 00:00:35.720
her in which we discussed her evolution from a lefty to a conservative is one of

12
00:00:35.721 --> 00:00:37.460
the moments that really put her on the map.

13
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.180
It was the first time that she had been able to explain herself in her own words

14
00:00:41.181 --> 00:00:43.400
in a long form conversational setting.

15
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.470
I don't want to rehash the whole thing right now,

16
00:00:45.471 --> 00:00:49.820
but Candace is no stranger to controversy and you may remember that infamous

17
00:00:49.821 --> 00:00:52.910
debate that I had with Candice and Blair white late last year.

18
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.550
The whole thing was a debacle.
I make no bones about it,

19
00:00:55.551 --> 00:00:59.000
but hashtag save Dave trended on Twitter.
So who am I to complain?

20
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.950
2018 has already been a huge year for Candice as she was hired as communications

21
00:01:03.951 --> 00:01:05.840
director for turning point USA,

22
00:01:05.841 --> 00:01:09.380
the largest conservative college group in America.
Since then,

23
00:01:09.381 --> 00:01:13.100
she's been touring the country with Charlie Kirk,
talking to young people,

24
00:01:13.101 --> 00:01:17.900
particularly young black people as why they should embrace the victor mentality

25
00:01:17.901 --> 00:01:19.760
rather than the victim mentality.

26
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.560
This is included directly attacking the black lives matter movement as well as

27
00:01:24.561 --> 00:01:25.970
democratic policies,

28
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.350
which Candace argues has decimated the black family and the black community.

29
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.670
Just last week hand is Charlie and I spoke at Berkeley to a wild crowd.

30
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.840
I'm proud to say that we had agreements and we had disagreements and even though

31
00:01:38.841 --> 00:01:40.610
our styles are different,
no doubt,

32
00:01:40.611 --> 00:01:43.430
Candice certainly goes for the jugular more than I do.

33
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.540
I always enjoy doing events with her and seeing her evolve politically.

34
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.670
Something I know a bit about myself.

35
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.960
She's learning as she goes and as she said to me in our interview,

36
00:01:53.961 --> 00:01:57.710
if I had swallowed the red pill,
then she had snorted it.

37
00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.990
Beyond any of the politics,
though,

38
00:01:59.991 --> 00:02:03.380
Candice is a friend and our differences don't define us.

39
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.650
They actually bring us together.
All right.
Back to kindy for a second.

40
00:02:06.651 --> 00:02:08.570
Beyond the headlines,
I don't know a ton about him,

41
00:02:08.571 --> 00:02:12.980
although I'm obviously aware enough to recognize what a transcending cultural

42
00:02:12.981 --> 00:02:17.150
figure he is.
Not only is he hugely successful in the music world,

43
00:02:17.151 --> 00:02:21.170
he has a hugely successful fashion line and he's married to Kim Kardashian who

44
00:02:21.171 --> 00:02:24.920
has her own empire.
You may not like the guy for whatever reason,

45
00:02:24.921 --> 00:02:28.640
but make no mistake,
he is an absolute mogul.

46
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.930
I may not like or even respect the influence that celebrities have over culture

47
00:02:32.931 --> 00:02:33.471
these days,

48
00:02:33.471 --> 00:02:38.471
but Kanye is truly someone who can move people's minds with what he raps or with

49
00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:42.380
what he tweets.
This is exactly what happened with these seven words.

50
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.710
Immediately after kinase tweet in support of canvas,

51
00:02:45.711 --> 00:02:48.410
the Internet went ablaze Twitter moments.

52
00:02:48.411 --> 00:02:53.120
Lead story was about Kanye support for far right.
Candice Owens.

53
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.120
Candace was called anti gay and racist.

54
00:02:56.121 --> 00:02:59.440
Something I'm still confused about as she's had dinner here with me and my

55
00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:04.150
husband at our home where her auntie game has never seemed to leak out as
racist.

56
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:08.530
There's nothing like a white lefty telling a black person who doesn't think as

57
00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:09.820
they demand that they do,

58
00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:13.240
that the black person is the actual racist against their own race.

59
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.000
Irony is truly dead.
Folks.
On Monday this week,

60
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:18.940
Kanye refused to back down despite hysterics from the media.

61
00:03:18.941 --> 00:03:22.210
He tweeted out a bunch of videos by another former Rubin report,
guests,

62
00:03:22.211 --> 00:03:25.660
bestselling author and dober creators,
Scott Adams.
In essence,

63
00:03:25.661 --> 00:03:29.740
these videos were Scott talking about what a free thinker Kanye is.
That's it.

64
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.910
Next thing you know,
the usual suspects like buzzfeed media,

65
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.430
the daily beast and others were labeling Scott Adams as far right.

66
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.420
We've seen the script a million times before with anyone who dare challenge

67
00:03:40.421 --> 00:03:44.500
leftist Orthodoxy,
be it Candace Scott,
column,
Moriarty,

68
00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:46.780
Jordan Peterson,
or even little old me.

69
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.460
When mainstream media has moved so far left that this wide collection of people

70
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:55.210
are all smeared with the same charges of far right racism.

71
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.470
You know that the Overton window hasn't just shifted.
It's shattered.

72
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.670
The authors of these pieces aren't journalists.
They're activists,

73
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.370
or as Candice says,
they are a journalist there.

74
00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:08.770
Hitmen to recap,

75
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.000
we have a new player in Kansas who is fearlessly saying how she believes that

76
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:16.390
the Democrats have used the black community for decades,

77
00:04:16.391 --> 00:04:21.130
and that the victimhood mentality of the left is the root of this problem.
This,

78
00:04:21.131 --> 00:04:21.461
by the way,

79
00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:24.430
is similar to what plenty of other conservatives have been saying for years,

80
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:28.420
and yes,
this includes even black conservatives like my former guests,

81
00:04:28.421 --> 00:04:30.040
Larry elder and Thomas Soul.

82
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.630
The voices of black conservatives and others espousing similar ideas has been

83
00:04:34.631 --> 00:04:37.330
largely ignored by the mainstream media.
However,

84
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.920
and that is exactly why everyone is freaking out about kinase tweets.

85
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.750
He just gave oxygen to a set of ideas that the Democrats and the mainstream

86
00:04:46.751 --> 00:04:48.460
media don't want you to hear,

87
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.550
and since they've controlled the narrative for so long,

88
00:04:51.551 --> 00:04:55.060
they've relied on the usual smears of racism,
homophobia,

89
00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:58.540
and bigotry instead of strengthening their own ideas.

90
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.830
Your ideas get fat and lazy when you don't have to work them out because you've

91
00:05:02.831 --> 00:05:04.480
owned the narrative for so long.

92
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.630
This is where the modern left finds itself right now.

93
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.210
If canvas is views are far right,

94
00:05:10.211 --> 00:05:14.080
then that means that about 40% of America,
if not more,

95
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.580
falls into that category.
I do want to address a different lurking danger here.

96
00:05:18.581 --> 00:05:19.360
However,

97
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.900
I know Candace and I believe her to be forthright and passionate as she figures

98
00:05:22.901 --> 00:05:27.160
this all out.
I obviously don't know Kanye nor any of his political beliefs,

99
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.930
so we've an interesting match here where Candace is now the rocket and Kanye is

100
00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:32.890
the jet fuel.

101
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.970
If Candace doesn't do the intellectual work to really figure out what she

102
00:05:36.971 --> 00:05:41.740
believes and why she believes it all the while being under the insane microscope

103
00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:44.050
of the media that's going to be praying for her to fail,

104
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.800
well then the rocket will be faulty and this experiment will blow up.

105
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.220
What if Kanye says something absolutely crazy tomorrow,

106
00:05:51.221 --> 00:05:52.510
which is not only possible,

107
00:05:52.511 --> 00:05:56.950
it's probable or something that's counter to everything else that can believes

108
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.580
he's been known to stir the pot,

109
00:05:58.581 --> 00:06:02.330
and I can only assume that something like that will happen either intentionally

110
00:06:02.331 --> 00:06:06.290
or by mistake.
Does her rocket ship run out of fuel in mid flight?

111
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.080
Where does that leave this incredible momentum?

112
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.290
Over the past year when I've talked to people like Eric and Bret Weinstein,

113
00:06:12.291 --> 00:06:15.980
Jordan Peterson,
Ben Shapiro,
Larry Elder,
Thomas Soul,
and many others.

114
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.240
What I'm most impressed by is how complete their outlook on politics and more

115
00:06:20.241 --> 00:06:24.020
broadly on life is.
They don't jump from conclusion to conclusion.

116
00:06:24.021 --> 00:06:25.610
Depending on the political climate.

117
00:06:25.611 --> 00:06:28.850
They try to really understand what they fundamentally think,

118
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.950
so as new issues arise,
they're responses are complete rather than conflicted.

119
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.950
This is something I've really tried to incorporate into my thinking and

120
00:06:36.951 --> 00:06:40.970
something that I know many of you are trying to do as well.
This will also be,

121
00:06:40.971 --> 00:06:43.910
Candice is challenged now and I think she's up to it,

122
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.700
but only she can decide that for herself.

123
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:51.020
It blows my mind that every conversation we have in this room seems to become

124
00:06:51.021 --> 00:06:54.500
more and more relevant as time goes by.
For All I know,

125
00:06:54.501 --> 00:06:57.500
we'll have Kanye in that guest seat soon enough.

126
00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:02.770
Whether he is just rocket fuel to boost ideas or is he the rocket ship that will

127
00:07:02.961 --> 00:07:07.250
get us to the solutions remains to be seen but make no mistake.

128
00:07:07.251 --> 00:07:10.040
The issues around free speech,
political correctness,

129
00:07:10.041 --> 00:07:14.960
and the uncomfortable truths that might be the answers to those questions have

130
00:07:14.961 --> 00:07:18.410
just been leveled up.
Are the players ready for the next level?

131
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:19.700
We'll soon find out.

132
00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:27.650
<v 0>Okay.</v>
