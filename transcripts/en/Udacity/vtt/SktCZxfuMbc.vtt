00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.939
Since around 2005 malware has been used
to control compromised computers and

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:10.990
networks to perform malicious activities
that often lead to elicit financial and

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.130
even geopolitical gains.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.960
In other words, whereas computers in the
past were merely targets of malware for

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.540
fun, they are now resources that malware
can take control of for profits and

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:23.750
gains.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.545
Since modern malware are now used to
do real work to achieve profits and

00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:31.760
gains, they tend to be
technically sophisticated and

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.070
utilize the latest technologies.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.000
For example, they have utilized
popular peer to peer protocols and

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.290
applications to set up communications.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.520
And they've used cloud computer servers
to support their activities, and they

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.240
have used the latest crypto algorithms
to perform authentication and encryption

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.300
to protect their communications
from subversion and analysis.
