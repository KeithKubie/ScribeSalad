00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.410
The answer is on the order
of t squared steps.

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.000
The reason for
this comes from two observations.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.640
The first, is that simulating
a step of the multitape machine

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.370
with a single tape machine,

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.219
involves a number of steps proportional
to the total number of symbols used.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.750
Recall that each step of
the multitape machine

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.770
was simulated with two
passes over the tape.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.890
With k tapes, up to k minus one
more passes are possible, for

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.230
shifting cells to the right, but
we're treating k as a constant here.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.620
The second observation, is that at step
i of the multitape machine, the number

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.218
of symbols used is at most the original
size of the input, plus k times i.

00:00:40.218 --> 00:00:43.360
Since at most k symbols can be added

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.040
during each step of
the multitape machine M.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.910
Summing over the different
steps of the multitape machine,

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.220
we can put a t squared bound
on the first term here.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.670
And then the second term just
becomes the arithmetic sequence,

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.250
which we can write like this.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.070
And that also is order t squared.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.080
So that's the answer.
