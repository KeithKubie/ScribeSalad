00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
First, let's describe the function, as the problem asked.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We have a function: "print<u>multiplication</u>table"

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
that takes in one number that we called "n".

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
If you looked at the output in the example,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
you'll notice that the first operand goes from 1 to "n".

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Let's write the "while" loop that does that.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Here, we called the first operand "i".

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Now let's think about the second operand.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
For every value of the first operand, it goes from 1 to "n".

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Let's write a second "while" loop

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
inside this "while" loop to do just that.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We called our second operand "j".

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Everything in the body of this "while" loop

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
is indented twice over from the beginning:

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
once for the function definition, and another time for the "while" loop.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Everything in the inner "while" loop is indented 3 times:

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
once for the function definition,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
once for the first "while" loop,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and a third time for this inner "while" loop.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The last thing that remains is printing the output.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
This may look right, but we have to remember

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that we can't add a number and a string.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
If you looked at the hint below the question, you know that

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
the "str" function will turn any integer into a string.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
&gt;From there, we can add the 2 strings.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
[Yay! Nested Loops!]
