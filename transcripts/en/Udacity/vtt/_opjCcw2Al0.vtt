00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Google app engine has a number of

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
different options for the types of the properties of an entity,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
or if we were to use our old verbiage,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
the columns of our table.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Some of the popular ones are

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
integer, which is for storing integers,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
float for storing floating point numbers,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
string for storing strings,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and we've got a date for storing dates,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
we've got time for storing times,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and then we've got date times

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
for storing both dates and times.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
These are pretty handy.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
They even have properties that are things like

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
email, a link, a postal address.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
App engine has all sorts of handy types you can use.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So what I would like to do really quick

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
is have a little quiz.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.050
We are going to have a couple of properties on our art class.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.250
Properties remember are basically what we have been calling columns.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.120
We're going to have one for the title,

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.190
we're going to have 1 for the art,

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.530
and I'm going to have another one, I'm going to call it created,

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.330
and this is going to be when

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.170
the art was submitted to our site.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.700
What I would like you to do is decide

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.700
which of these types we should use for

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.240
each of these properties,

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.240
and oh, by the way, this has turned into a quiz.
