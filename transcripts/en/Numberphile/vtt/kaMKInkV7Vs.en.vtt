00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.620
We've got a cake.

00:00:01.629 --> 00:00:04.048
We're gonna cut it. Now if there was

00:00:04.048 --> 00:00:06.420
two of us, as there are, this is quite simple.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.700
You just, one person cuts, the other person chooses. All nice and fair, no one's envious,

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.240
perfect way to cut the cake. A lot trickier, though, when you have three people.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.040
We've got three people,

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.740
Alice, Bob and Charlie. And they're gonna share this cake.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.540
And we want to make sure that it's as fair as possible.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.910
And at the end, nobody is envious of anybody else's cake. Turns out there's a very good way to do this that's

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:35.339
actually quite recently discovered, and I'm gonna try and talk you through. So, Alice goes first.

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.919
And Alice gets to cut the cake into three pieces that she feels are

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.920
equal, so she would be happy with any of those three pieces.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.180
Oh, Gosh.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.380
Okay, I'm gonna go there.The thing is I've got a get out of jail free card, 'cause it's a fruitcake, so I can just claim that there's more fruit

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.959
in one side. That was what I was aiming for. It's not bad.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.880
Okay.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.659
Brady: "I think I can see the dud piece."

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:01.700
Which one's the dud piece?

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.880
Brady: "I think that's a bit smaller."

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.560
No.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.780
Brady: "Well you have got more there."

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:05.860
It's got more sparkly bits on it.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:06.680
Yeah. Absolutely.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.560
There's, there's, I mean, there's more to a cake than just size. Some people like the sort of crusty bit around the outside, some people like

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.360
the sugary bits, some people, you know, hate the fruits, there's, it's your personal preference that comes into this as well.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.720
Okay. So, Alice has cut the cake into three pieces where she wouldn't mind which of those three pieces she got.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.020
Now, it's Bob's turn.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.680
So, Bob gets to pick which he thinks are his two favorite pieces.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.220
Now, you then said that that one was the rubbish piece,

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.739
so let's kind of leave that to one side, and assume that Bob goes for one of these two. But Bob, from those two,

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.119
says which he thinks is the best piece of all. Let's imagine that Bob thinks this bit's the best bit.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:48.930
Now what Bob has do, he gets the knife now, and Bob gets to cut a little trimming off of his favorite piece

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.290
until his favorite piece is now

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.359
equally as good as his second favorite piece, right? So that little trimming kind of goes to one side, there.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.520
So now Bob doesn't mind

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.909
between getting this one or this one. He's fine. He's happy with either of those. Alice is sort of sitting to one side,

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.810
desperately waiting for them to hurry up so she can have some cake. Charlie, it's now Charlie's go,

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.460
Charlie gets to pick which piece of cake he wants to eat. He can have whichever he wants.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.679
So Charlie might pick one of the pieces that hasn't been trimmed, or he might pick the piece which has been trimmed.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:27.030
Whatever piece he picks, let's say he picked this one here, it's now gonna be Bob's turn to choose a slice of cake.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.630
If Charlie didn't take the trimmed piece, Bob's gonna want it, because he's already said that that's his top, you know, in his top two,

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.029
joint top, so Bob's gonna take that piece, so now Bob's happy, Charlie's definitely happy, they got first choice

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.410
Bob's definitely happy, 'cause that was his equal top two,

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.189
and now Alice ends up with this piece, and she's definitely gonna be happy too, because

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.680
she cut the cake in the first place, and she cut It in a way that she thought that all three pieces were equally fair.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.900
So that's fine, right? So that's the majority of the cake sorted. Now, we have to deal with this trimming.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.120
Which looks a bit pathetic.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.760
Brady: "You can't just toss that, there? There's no waste."

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.040
No, no, that's wasteful, Brady.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.200
No.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:12.240
Because Charlie went last, on the first main cake cutting section, Charlie now gets

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:19.950
to go first, on this bit. So Charlie gets to cut this trimming into three pieces so that he thinks that each piece is

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:27.240
equally as good as the others, okay? Now once he's done that, now Bob gets to pick which of those pieces he

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.780
wants. Let's say Bob goes for this one here. Now Bob is definitely happy because he's got his number one choice out of the trimmings and

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.780
we already know that he's happy with his main chunk of cake.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.070
Now it's Alice's go, and whichever one Alice picks, she's definitely gonna be happy, because in the very beginning,

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.489
she thought that all three of the pieces of cake were equally good,

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:50.609
she's ended up with one that hadn't been trimmed off, and now she's got an extra bit, so there's, she's definitely gonna be happy.

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:55.700
And then finally, Charlie ends up with the last little trimming, and he's definitely gonna be happy, too,

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.620
because he cut the trimmings in a way that he thought that they were all equal.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.220
So there you go. That is envy-free,

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.540
totally fair and totally delicious cake.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.870
There is actually an

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:17.320
n-person version of this algorithm. The only thing is, the number of cuts that it takes to get this sort of envy-free solution

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.520
gets a bit bonkers.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.480
Brady: "Yeah, so what do we start getting trimmings of trimmings?"

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.820
Trimmings of trimmings, and trimmings of trimmings of trimmings trimmings.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.880
So in general, the number of cuts that It takes to divide a cake

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:33.630
between n people fairly is n to the n to the n to the n to the n to the n.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.160
Which is kind of bonkers.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.360
You are never aware of how much noise your body makes

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.160
until you are sat in front of

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.600
an unbelievably sensitive microphone

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.140
with, you know, headphones sort of looping yourself back, you know, into your ears.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.860
What do you mean, like a grumbly tummy?

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.100
Grumbly tummy, my God, you never notice how grumbly your tummy is. When you're in an audio booth,

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.820
it's like, it's like roaring in your ears continually.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.020
If you don't listen to audiobooks, it is something you should try, and you should go to audible.com

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:10.620
slash

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:11.639
numberphile

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:16.339
because audible have the best range of audio books out there. And if you sign up for their

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.799
30-day trial, using that URL on the screen,

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.700
you can download a free book. You can start off with a free one, and I'm gonna recommend

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.380
well, this is a physical copy, but I'm gonna recommend the audiobook of this one, which is called,

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.190
The Mathematics of Love, Patterns, Proofs and the Search for the Ultimate Equation. Do you like that?

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.400
a little bit of curly writing going on there.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.540
The Mathematics of Love and it's, oh! It's by you!

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:39.860
Oh, my God!

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.160
And the reason I'm talking about it now, is because, not only did Hannah write this book,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.060
but she recorded the audiobook version of it.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.740
And I want to quickly talk to her about that, because I've never met someone before who's done this.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.560
The one that you feel really self-conscious about is,

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:59.020
it's really kind of a bit gross, actually, but like, the sort of the sound of, that your mouth makes.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.280
Wet noise?

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.640
Yeah, exactly. So, it's sort of almost like clicking. Just the way that your saliva moves around in your mouth.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.400
So, there are a few tricks that they have to try and minimize it. One of them is to make you eat green apples.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:17.360
You're kind of sat in this audio booth eating green apples, trying to reduce the clicking sound. Oh, and you're also not allowed to have milk

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.120
or chocolate before you do It.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.840
You can't have milk or chocolate before you record, and you have green apples with you.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.220
Yeah, milk and chocolate makes you a bit too mucousy. So disgusting.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.792
So when I listen to. Have you ever listened back to your audiobook? Like, have you got it on your...?

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.120
Absolutely. It's like someone pouring honey in your ears.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.080
Well. That sounds interesting.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.260
I'm joking.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.460
So if you would like to have honey poured in your ears by Hannah,

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.340
then can I recommend you go to audible.com slash numberphile

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:54.339
30 day trial on audible. You can, you can download any book as your free one, but I'm gonna recommend

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:59.889
the honey in your ears that is The Mathematics of Love by Hannah Fry.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.220
We haven't actually said what the book's about, because I've been so fascinated by -

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.320
It's obvious.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.960
It's obvious what it's about. It's all about, like, how mathematics applies to things like

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.620
dating and relationships and stuff like that.

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:12.580
Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:16.280
How to use maths to make your own love life a little bit more efficient.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.740
And it is, it is quite a good book.

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.900
I have read it. And I have listened to it.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.180
Honey? ... dunno.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.420
Maybe, maybe.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.780
More mucousy milk.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.140
That's right.
