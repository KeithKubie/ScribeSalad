00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.390
In the last video, we
took our first look

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:04.889
at the epsilon-delta definition
of limits, which essentially

00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:08.800
says if you claim that the limit
of f of x as x approaches C

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.020
is equal to L, then that
must mean by the definition

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.250
that if you were given any
positive epsilon that it

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.010
essentially tells us how close
we want f of x to be to L.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.152
We can always find
a delta that's

00:00:23.152 --> 00:00:25.110
greater than 0, which is
essentially telling us

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.050
our distance from C such that
if x is within delta of C,

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.285
then f of x is going to
be within epsilon of L.

00:00:34.285 --> 00:00:37.530
If we can find a
delta for any epsilon,

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.310
then we can say
that this is indeed

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.715
the limit of f of x
as x approaches C.

00:00:43.715 --> 00:00:45.090
Now, I know what
you're thinking.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.250
This seems all very abstract.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.530
I want to somehow
use this thing.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.660
And what we will do in
this video is use it

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.040
and to rigorously prove that
a limit actually exists.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.400
So, right over here, I've
defined a function, f of x.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.850
It's equal to 2x everywhere
except for x equals 5.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.960
So it's 2x everywhere for
all the other values of x,

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.340
but when x is equal to
5, it's just equal to x.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.750
So I could have
really just written 5.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.430
It's equal to 5 when
x is equal to 5.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.370
It's equal to itself.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.420
And so we've drawn
the graph here.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.760
Everywhere else, it
looks just like 2x.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.360
At x is equal to 5, it's
not along the line 2x.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.580
Instead, the function
is defined to be

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.610
that point right over there.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.660
And if I were to ask you
what is the limit of f

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.799
of x as x approaches
5, you might

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.090
think of it pretty intuitively.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.756
Well, let's see.

00:01:37.756 --> 00:01:41.930
The closer I get
to 5, the closer

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.740
f of x seems to
be getting to 10.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.380
And so, you might fairly
intuitively make the claim

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.550
that the limit of f of x
as x approaches 5 really

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:59.890
is equal to 10.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.140
It looks that way.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.980
But what we're
going to do is use

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.080
the epsilon-delta definition
to actually prove it.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.030
And the way that most of
these proofs typically go

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.330
is we define delta
in the abstract.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.500
And then we essentially
try to come up with a way

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.590
that given any epsilon, we can
always come up with a delta.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.110
Or another way is
we're going to try

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.510
to describe our delta as
a function of epsilon,

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.230
not to confuse you too much.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.810
But maybe I shouldn't
use f again.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.520
But delta equals
function of epsilon

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.770
that is defined for
any positive epsilon.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.960
So you give me an
epsilon, I just

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.400
put into our little formula
or little function box.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.070
And I will always
get you a delta.

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.790
And if I can do that for any
epsilon that'll always give you

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.600
a delta, where this is true,
that if x is within delta of C,

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.180
then the corresponding f of x
is going to be within epsilon

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.870
of L. Then the limit
definitely exists.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.090
So let's try to do that.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.490
So let's think about being
within delta of our C.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.070
So, let's think about this
right over here is 5 plus delta,

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.312
this is 5 minus delta.

00:03:11.312 --> 00:03:13.270
So that's our range we're
going to think about.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.170
We're going to think about
it in the abstract at first.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.753
And then we're going
to try to come up

00:03:16.753 --> 00:03:19.600
with a formula for delta
in terms of epsilon.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.750
So how could we describe all of
the x's that are in this range

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.216
but not equal to 5 itself?

00:03:25.216 --> 00:03:26.840
Because we really
care about the things

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.310
that are within delta of 5,
but not necessarily equal to 5.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.400
This is just a
strictly less than.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.940
They're within a range
of C, but not equal to C.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.950
Well, that's going to be all of
the x's that satisfy x minus 5

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.460
is less than delta.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.000
That describes all of
these x's right over here.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.250
And now, what we're going to
do, and the way these proofs

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.030
typically go, is
we're going to try

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.100
to manipulate the left-hand
side of the inequality,

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.180
so it starts to look
something like this,

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.350
or it starts to look
exactly like that.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.570
And as we do that,
the right-hand side

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.560
of the inequality is going to
be expressed in terms of delta.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.730
And then we can
essentially say well, look.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.771
If the right-hand
side is in terms

00:04:11.771 --> 00:04:13.520
of delta and the
left-hand side looks just

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.880
like that, that really defines
how we can express delta

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.560
in terms of epsilon.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.360
If that doesn't make
sense, bear with me.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.690
I'm about to do it.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.930
So, if we want x minus 5 to
look a lot more like this, when

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.780
x is not equal to 5-- in all
of this, this whole interval,

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.520
x is not equal to 5--
f of x is equal to 2x,

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.280
our proposed limit
is equal to 10.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.250
So if we could somehow get
this to be 2x minus 10,

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.515
then we're in good shape.

00:04:41.515 --> 00:04:42.890
And the easiest
way to do that is

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.730
to multiply both sides
of this inequality by 2.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.960
And 2 times the absolute
value of something,

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.760
that's the same thing as the
absolute value of 2 times

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.300
that thing.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.300
If I were to say 2 times
the absolute value of a,

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.460
that's the same thing as
the absolute value of 2a.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.800
So on the left-hand
side right over here,

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.930
this is just going to be the
absolute value of 2x minus 10.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.180
And it's going to be less
than on the right-hand side,

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.010
you just end up with a 2 delta.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.140
Now, what do we have here
on the left-hand side?

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.740
Well, this is f of x as
long as x does not equal 5.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.070
And this is our limit.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:28.570
So we can rewrite this as f of
x minus L is less than 2 delta.

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:34.210
And this is for x
does not equal 5.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.850
This is f of x, this
literally is our limit.

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:39.540
Now this is interesting.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.690
This statement right
over here is almost

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.650
exactly what we want
right over here,

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.490
except the right sides
are just different.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.730
In terms of epsilon, this
has it in terms of delta.

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:56.050
So, how can we define delta
so that 2 delta is essentially

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.854
going to be epsilon?

00:05:57.854 --> 00:05:58.895
Well, this is our chance.

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:07.420
And this is where we're defining
delta as a function of epsilon.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.600
We're going to make 2
delta equal epsilon.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.490
Or if you divide
both sides by 2,

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.535
we're going to make delta
equal to epsilon over 2.

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.840
Let me switch colors just
to ease the monotony.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:32.132
If you make delta
equal epsilon over 2,

00:06:32.132 --> 00:06:33.590
then this statement
right over here

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.530
becomes the absolute
value of f of x minus L

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.150
is less than,
instead of 2 delta,

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.730
it'll be less than 2
times epsilon over 2.

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:45.360
It's just going to
be less than epsilon.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.800
So this is the key.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.510
If someone gives you any
positive number epsilon

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:53.970
for this function, as long as
you make delta equal epsilon

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:59.060
over 2, then any x
within that range,

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.610
that corresponding
f of x is going

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.615
to be within epsilon
of our limit.

00:07:07.845 --> 00:07:10.220
And remember, it has to be
true for any positive epsilon.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.020
But you could see how
the game could go.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:15.360
If someone gives
you the epsilon,

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.270
let's say they want to be
within 0.5 of our limit.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.770
So our limit is up here,
so our epsilon is 0.5.

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.790
So it would literally be the
range I want to be between 10

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:26.160
plus epsilon would be 10.5.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.340
And then 10 minus
epsilon would be 9.5.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.270
Well, we just came
up with a formula.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:34.170
We just have to make
delta equal to epsilon

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:37.380
over 2, which is equal to 0.25.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:44.990
So that'll give us a range
between 4.75 and 5.25.

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:51.040
And as long as we pick an
x between 4.75 and 5.25,

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.510
but not x equals 5, the
corresponding f of x

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:57.090
will be between 9.5 and 10.5.

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:59.120
And so, you give
me any epsilon, I

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.617
can just apply this
formula right over here

00:08:02.617 --> 00:08:03.700
to come up with the delta.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.550
This would apply
for any real number.

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:07.350
I mean, especially
any positive number.

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:09.350
For any epsilon
you give me, I just

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:12.730
get a delta defined
this way, and then I

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:16.490
can go through this arc.

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:19.170
If the absolute value of x
minus 5 is less than delta,

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:21.990
if delta is defined
in this way, which

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:23.880
I could define for
any epsilon, then it

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.130
will be the case
that f of x will

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:29.730
be within epsilon of our limit.
