Okay, so we also have a question about AJAX, what exactly is it,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and how important is it to know AJAX and use AJAX?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Sure. What AJAX is is basically a request you make from the browser in JavaScript .

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It's an HTTP request, but basically it happens within the page.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
You can use this for loading just part of a page without reloading,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
basically without changing the URL.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
You can have extra little snippets.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
For example, the voting on Reddit--when you click one of those up arrows

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and the color just changes, we make an AJAX request to the server

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
that says such-and-such just voted on this link, and then we just update it

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
in the client using JavaScript.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
It is really handy. It's really common across just about all website these days.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
But it's not required.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Actually, I found that once you start thinking in AJAX, it's really hard to design things

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
kind of properly, it's hard to decide when should I actually have a new page

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and when shouldn't i.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I hope I did you a favor in terms of form validation and that sort of thing,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
so you can see how you do it the old fashioned way,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
before you reach the AJAX.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
AJAX isn't always the right tool.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
But as I just kind of alluded tool, form validation--when you type in all those things--

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
just hitting submit and then getting your errors without reloading the whole page

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
is a really common use of Ajax.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
But you still need to validate things when you submit the form for real,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
so you're going to have to do everything I just showed you anyway.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
As for how to learn that, just Google for it.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It's on every website. It's extremely popular.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Knowing what you know now in terms of requests and Git and posts in HTTP and all that

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
it should be a pretty easy concept for you to digest. &gt;&gt;There we go.
