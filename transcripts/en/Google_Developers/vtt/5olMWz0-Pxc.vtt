PREM RAMASWAMI: So my name
is Prem Ramaswami.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.060
I'm a product manager with
Google.org, which is Google's

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.120
technology-driven
philanthropy.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.950
And I'm here today with my
colleague, Steve Hakusa, who's

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.410
a software engineer.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.800
And Steve and I together work
on Google.org's crisis

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.090
response team, which looks to
make crucial information

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.670
available in the aftermath
of a natural disaster.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.950
Now, we're here today to talk
about how developers like

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.720
yourselves can feel empowered in
the aftermath of a crisis.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.470
We're always interested in your
feedback, which we'd love

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.220
for you to share, either on the
goo.gl links or any of the

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.580
Twitter hashtags behind me.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.950
And with that, I'd like to get
started with our story.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.890
As a team, our story starts on
January 12 of last year.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.780
Now on this day, you might
remember, there was a 7.0

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.200
magnitude earthquake that hit
the island nation of Haiti

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.239
outside of their capital
city of Port-au-Prince.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.840
Now this earthquake ended
up killing over a

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.456
quarter million people.

00:01:09.456 --> 00:01:13.140
It left another million
homeless, and two million in

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.680
need of food and water aid.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.800
As images started escaping
from Haiti, a group of us

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.630
Googlers got together and wanted
to see what we could do

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.970
to possibly help out.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.290
Now Google has been responding
to crises since about

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.270
Hurricane Katrina.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.880
And the way we do that is by
collecting updated satellite

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.950
imagery and publishing it to
our properties like Google

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.600
Maps and Google Earth.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.080
Aid agencies then use
that imagery.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.160
So in the aftermath of the
Haiti earthquake, we were

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.730
actually able to collect a
cloud-free shot over Haiti

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.560
with our partner GOI.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.675
And we were able to publish this
imagery to Google Maps

00:01:49.675 --> 00:01:52.920
and Google Earth within
the first 24 hours.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.120
Now this imagery really gave
us an understanding of the

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.460
level of devastation and
destruction that occurred over

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.250
the country.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.830
Now I said that aid
organizations

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:03.970
make use of this imagery.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.090
It's not just there for the
shock value of it, so I want

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.990
to get some key examples of
how aid organizations take

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.000
advantage of this.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.530
The World Bank, for example,
used this to conduct wide area

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.290
damage assessments.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.830
Other organizations used it to
identify the location of

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.820
refugee camps.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.400
It was also a nice way to
visualize the location of all

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.710
your clinics on a map that
were popping up in the

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.340
aftermath of this disaster.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.080
Now you can imagine why having
this information

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.660
geographically placed
is so important.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.410
For example, you want to make
sure these clinics are set up

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.430
next to your refugee camps so
you're properly servicing the

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.270
right populations.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.730
And I want to give it another
specific example of where

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.850
satellite imagery is
super helpful.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.640
This is the Petionville Golf
Course, which is located about

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.620
an hour south of the city
of Port-au-Prince.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.780
And this is a satellite image
of the golf course about six

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.640
months before the earthquake.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.580
A day after the earthquake, you
see little white specks

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.720
popping up on the golf course.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.950
And these are actually tents.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.225
Individuals who live in the
surrounding areas, whose

00:03:07.225 --> 00:03:09.650
houses are either destroyed
or they feel unsafe with a

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.240
concrete roof over their
head, have now moved

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.710
onto this golf course.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.130
And 13 days later the entire
golf course has become a

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.340
refugee camp, one of the
largest in Haiti.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.710
Now camps like this are easily
identifiable by viewing

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.350
time-lapse satellite imagery.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.230
Not just that, by knowing where
these refugee camps are,

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.040
aid organizations can make sure
they're appropriately

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.410
allocating their resources.

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.850
But as I said, we've been using
the satellite imagery

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.730
since about Hurricane Katrina.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.830
So when this group of Googlers
got together, we asked

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.020
ourselves, what else
could we do here?

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.670
Now, Google's mission, as a
company, is to organize the

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.050
world's information and
make it universally

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.140
accessible and useful.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.620
And so we decided we'd
organize all of the

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.990
information related to
this disaster in one

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.290
place, on a web page.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.970
And we call this
a landing page.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.060
And so we started organizing
this information, which

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.800
included things such as where
to donate, along with actual

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.160
ways that individuals could
help, news and updates that

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.740
were coming out of the region,
relevant maps, as well as

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.820
user-generated content such
as YouTube videos.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.830
This page was launched in 12
different languages, and it

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.420
was linked to from the
Google.com main page as well

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.180
as from what we call Enhanced
Search Results.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.730
So if you look for something
related to Haiti earthquake

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.510
from Google.com, you'd be
linked to this page.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.300
I wanted to spend the next few
minutes going through some of

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.740
the specific features that
were on this page.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.280
And one of those products that
we actually launched was a

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.610
tool called Person Finder.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.870
See, after the Haiti earthquake,
there were more

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.640
than 14 separate sites that
popped up to take care of

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.170
missing persons information
online.

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.190
Now all of these sites were
referring to missing people

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.080
with different standards.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.590
They were using different
infrastructure.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.070
None of them were integrated.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.700
Which meant that, if I were
missing a relative after the

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.480
earthquake, I would have to go
to each one of the 14 sites,

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.980
search for them, enter their
information, and keep

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.430
continuously looking at
all 14 to try to find

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.860
updates about them.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.910
Now this was a place where
Googlers felts we

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.640
could really help out.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.550
See, we wanted to build a simple
web application that

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.060
was super easy to use.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.930
We wanted to use an open
standard, specifically the

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.970
PFIF standard, or the Person
Finder Interchange Format.

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.900
And we wanted to make the tool
open, so we'd give open access

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.760
via an API so all of these
different sites could push and

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.460
pull their data to
and from it.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.880
And so we had this 72-hour
hack-a-thon that occurred

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.900
globally, in Mountain View, New
York, Zurich, and Israel.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.590
And engineers around the globe
worked and launched the Person

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.930
Finder web application
on App Engine.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.070
And we noticed something
interesting happen, sites like

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:01.560
CNN, NPR, The New York Times
integrated to Person Finder.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.560
And as a victim, I no longer
needed to go to all 14

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.270
separate sites.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.450
I could go to any one of them
and now see that same

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:10.620
information mirrored across.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.600
Now another area where we
thought we could help out was

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.830
with relevant mapping
information.

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.840
See there was a lot of maps that
were being created in the

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.860
aftermath of the earthquake.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.360
And this included stuff like
the World Bank's damage

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.940
assessment I showed earlier.

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.770
Or even things as simple
as earthquake

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.140
locations from the USGS.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:28.910
Now the problem was, this
information was

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.680
strewn across the web.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.050
And it was in different
formats, often not

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.960
machine-readable formats.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.900
And so our engineers crawled the
web, found a lot of this

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.180
information, scraped it,
converted it to a common

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.790
format like KML, and then placed
it on this common map

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.711
that we then link to from
our landing page.

00:06:47.711 --> 00:06:50.790
Now you can just click on and
off any of the layers here,

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:52.930
and as an aid organization,
or someone interested in

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.850
understanding what's happening
on the ground, you could get

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:57.760
more of a complete picture
because you could layer on

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.290
different layers from different
organizations.

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:03.290
And it wasn't just Google
that was helping

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:04.440
out in the tech space.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.160
There were organizations
like Open Street Map.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.250
So Open Street Map is a
collaborative mapping platform

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:12.880
very similar to Google's
own Map Maker.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.850
Now what Open Street Map did was
they took advantage of the

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:19.800
local Haitian diaspora that
was around the world with

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.400
knowledge, with relevant
knowledge about Haiti's roads

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.500
to actually digitally draw
them out on a map.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.180
Now why is this actually
useful?

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.750
As an aid organization, when I
come to Haiti and I want to

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.140
deliver my aid from point
a to point b, I need to

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.640
know how to get there.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.210
And the fact is, there were no
good maps to help people out.

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.600
The work done by the Haitian
diaspora community and Open

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.880
Street Map ended up being quoted
as the most complete

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.650
digital maps of Haiti's
roads ever created.

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:48.930
And it was hugely important.

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:55.820
Ushahidi also emerged as a very
important platform after

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.200
the earthquake.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.110
Ushahidi was initially created
to report post-election

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:02.690
violence in Kenya.

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.420
But it's a simple incident
reporting platform.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.840
Now what that means is,
individuals come to it and

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.600
they say something
has happened.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.070
That gets categorized by a group
of volunteers and then

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:14.320
placed on this map.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.240
Now why this is helpful is you
can start seeing clusters of

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.660
information start appearing
in a map like this.

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.530
For example, as an aid
organization, I can come to a

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:25.100
site like Ushahidi and start
seeing areas that are in need

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.940
of immediate food aid.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.450
Or I can see areas which have
outbreaks of violence

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:33.590
occurring so I can keep
my staff away from it.

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:37.400
Now it's important to know that
Ushahidi required you to

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.520
be able to submit these reports
via web, but not every

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.220
Haitian had access to a
computer, especially after the

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:44.310
earthquake.

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:46.980
But everyone did have
mobile phones.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.730
So a large coalition of
nonprofits, including

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:53.470
Ushahidi, FrontlineSMS, and
InSTEDD worked to launch the

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:55.802
4636 project.

00:08:55.802 --> 00:09:00.740
Now 4636 was a free
SMS shortcut.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.370
Individuals on the ground could
SMS a message to the

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:06.100
short code that got picked up
by a group of volunteers on

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.230
the back end.

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:10.620
Now we then again categorize
it and place it on a map.

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:14.610
Now this not only made maps
like Ushahidi richer, it

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:16.040
actually helped save lives.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.790
There's an example from Haiti
where individuals stuck in

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:23.690
rubble would SMS their messages
on their location.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:26.010
They would then get picked up by
these volunteers who would

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:28.750
place it on a map and relay that
message to the US Coast

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:30.860
Guard or US Southern Command.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:34.930
Using this method, over a
hundred lives were saved.

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:37.640
Now, this isn't to understate
the importance of technologies

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.170
like radio and TV, but the
fact is, the internet was

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:41.560
having a key role in Haiti.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.700
And we have some metrics
to prove this.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.570
So Google's landing page had
over four million page views.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:49.840
There were over 80,000 text
messages that were handled by

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.300
project 4636.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:54.020
There were 2,500 volunteers
around the world managing

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:55.020
those messages.

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:58.270
And there over a hundred
lives saved.

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:01.390
There were over 55,000 missing
persons records stored in

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:03.740
Person Finder by the end of
the Haiti earthquake.

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:07.330
And in addition, the American
Red Cross collected $32

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.420
million with an SMS text
campaign in the US.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:13.330
This is the largest amount
ever collected by one

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:16.620
organization for a
single campaign.

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.780
Finally thousands of
contributions were made to

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.950
both Open Street Map and Google
Map Maker, and as we

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:24.160
said, Open Street Map ended up
being the most complete map of

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.970
Haiti's roads ever.

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:28.650
And so a group of us decided
to travel to Haiti, to

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:31.400
actually understand the
situation on the ground and

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.520
see where else technology
could have a key role.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.890
And I wanted to give two
small examples from

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:38.850
our trip down there.

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:41.580
This is a doctor writing patient
care instructions on

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:45.020
the floor outside of
a patient's room.

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:49.340
And this is a map of a field
hospital's resources.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.290
Now, these were areas where we
believe that technology really

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:53.520
could help out.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.910
So upon returning back to
Google, we actually spoke to

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:57.890
Larry and Sergey--

00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:59.500
Google's founders--

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.430
and we pitched this
idea of a team.

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:03.720
A Google.org Crisis
Response Team.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:07.110
And it would be modeled very
similar to other Google.com

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:08.720
project teams, with core

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.160
engineering and product support.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.620
And our mission as a team would
be to make this crucial

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:17.090
information more accessible
during natural disasters and

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:19.190
humanitarian crises.

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:21.250
Now Larry and Sergey were not
only supportive, they were

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:24.380
extremely enthusiastic at the
possibilities that technology

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.500
could have in this space.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:30.440
We knew that we'd never be
domain experts here.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.390
But what we did know is
that we understood web

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:34.880
technologies, and we wanted to
bring that understanding to

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:39.740
assist aid organizations and
victims after a disaster.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.120
So before I go into any more
detail, I wanted to invite my

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.970
colleague Steve up to stage to
talk about how our team has

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.790
evolved over the last year and
a half, and how the Crisis

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:51.910
Response ecosystem
has developed.

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:53.940
Steve.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.380
STEVE HAKUSA: Thanks Prem.

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:59.135
So Prem just showed you a number
of internet-based tools

00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:03.380
that had a measurable impact
on the response in Haiti.

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:05.460
We think this is just
the beginning.

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:09.660
At Google, we're excited than a
number of organizations see

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:14.876
the Haiti earthquake as the
start of crisis response 2.0,

00:12:14.876 --> 00:12:19.100
as a turning point in using
widely accepted consumer

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:22.890
technology to mitigate crises.

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:26.510
Google is looking to do much
more in this space, working

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:29.790
closely with a number of other
organizations that are doing

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:32.580
similar great things.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:34.270
But this isn't enough.

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:37.085
We also need your help.

00:12:37.085 --> 00:12:40.020
Because crises aren't
going away.

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:42.650
It's been-- we've responded at
Google to more in the first

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:46.142
quarter of this year than all
of last year combined.

00:12:46.142 --> 00:12:49.620
Now is the time to jump
in and get started.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:53.130
I want to give you an idea of
some of the problems and

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:56.940
challenges that we see in this
area, both for us and for

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.270
developers like yourselves.

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:02.430
And then show you how we're
using openly available Google

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:07.670
technology and web standards
to be able to help.

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:10.380
The first question you might
have, though, is does the

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:14.550
internet even work
after a disaster?

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:18.250
And it might be surprising, but
in every single crisis--

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:21.210
major crisis-- that we've
seen since Haiti, the

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:23.136
internet has stayed up.

00:13:23.136 --> 00:13:24.345
And how do we know this?

00:13:24.345 --> 00:13:26.360
In three different ways.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:30.490
The first is local ISPs, which
continue to broadcast routes

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:31.550
from their edge routers.

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:32.750
We pick these up.

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:35.525
And after a disaster, we
still see them happen.

00:13:35.525 --> 00:13:38.660
The second is traffic
to Google sites from

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:40.730
the affected areas.

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:44.250
And third is the stories that
we hear of people on the

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:47.790
ground using the internet
as a critical tool for

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:51.770
communication in the immediate
aftermath of a disaster.

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:55.020
The internet was designed
to be resilient, to take

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:59.220
advantage of robustness and
route packets along the path

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:00.310
of least resistance.

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:03.770
We see people taking
advantage of that.

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:07.200
Haiti was a worst case scenario,
an impoverished

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.730
island with poor infrastructure
and low

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:12.130
internet penetration.

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:14.690
The earthquake actually severed
the only fiber cable

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:17.850
coming into the country, leaving
just a microwave radio

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:21.000
link to the Dominican
Republic.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.420
And with the scope of
the disaster we

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:25.240
couldn't hope for much.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:28.850
But fortunately, internet and
telecom companies were better

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:33.190
prepared, and they survived
pretty much intact.

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:36.140
This is a graph of traffic
to Google from Haiti

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:38.780
on January 12, 2010.

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:40.880
You can see that when the
earthquake hit, there was a

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:44.560
large power outage and traffic
to Google dropped.

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.850
But you'll notice,
importantly, it

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:47.590
didn't drop to zero.

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:50.050
The internet stayed up.

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:52.960
We heard numerous stories of
people on the ground using

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:56.040
Smartphones, getting on Facebook
and Twitter, telling

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:59.040
friends and family that they
were OK, and providing some of

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.930
the first on-the-ground news
reports of the level of

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:04.910
destruction there.

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:08.420
Because of the situation in
Haiti, it took four months for

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:11.130
the internet, to traffic
to Google, to return to

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:12.890
pre-earthquake levels.

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:15.490
But the internet
was always up.

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:18.220
Just a couple of weeks after the
disaster, we heard people

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:21.020
in the Peshionville golf course
camp, that Prem showed

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:24.740
you pictures of before, watching
YouTube videos.

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.410
The internet was there.

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:33.250
This is a similar graph in
Chile February 27, 2010.

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:35.720
This graphs that access
a little different.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:38.100
Each peak and valley represents
a single day,

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:41.790
traffic rises during the day
and then drops at night.

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:45.360
The red line represents an 8.8
magnitude earthquake that

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:48.610
struck there in the middle
of the night.

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:51.370
There was a resulting tsunami
that hit a major network hub

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:52.720
in Santiago.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:56.390
We actually did stop seeing
from the ISPs routes being

00:15:56.390 --> 00:16:00.080
broadcast. But only
for 15 minutes.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.250
After that, the internet was
back up, and you see within a

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:05.350
week, traffic had returned
to pre-earthquake levels.

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:10.460
Here's the situation from
New Zealand, after the

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:12.895
Christchurch earthquake just
this past February.

00:16:12.895 --> 00:16:14.540
You can see when the earthquake
hit there was

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:17.470
barely an effect on
internet traffic.

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:20.300
We had conducted numerous
interviews with people on the

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.390
ground in Christchurch.

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:25.010
And they said that phones, after
the earthquake, phones

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:25.690
were saturated.

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:27.080
They would not work.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.840
SMS wouldn't be delivered
at all, or be

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.140
delivered hours late.

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:33.490
But the internet, the
internet was fine.

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:36.180
People said email was the only
way to communicate after the

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:39.250
disaster in Christchurch.

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:42.530
Vint Serf, one of the founders
of the internet, says, "The

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:44.780
Internet was designed with
a significant degree of

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:46.140
resilience built in.

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:48.890
And I am pleased to know that
it has often served as an

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:51.050
important platform for
communication during

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:55.310
emergencies." Now Vint also
wanted me to point out that

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:57.600
this resilience shouldn't be
confused with the ability to

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.240
resist determined
attacks, right?

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.340
But I think the point here is
clear, that the immense value

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:05.710
that the internet brings in
communication and data sharing

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:10.170
also applies to disaster
situations.

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:13.030
So given that, the next question
to ask is, what

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:14.150
problems are there?

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:16.420
We look at that and say, who
are our users and what are

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.280
their needs?

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.619
We see three main
groups of users.

00:17:20.619 --> 00:17:23.002
First are those directly
affected by the crisis.

00:17:23.002 --> 00:17:26.530
Then their friends, families,
neighbors,

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:28.039
those indirectly affected.

00:17:28.039 --> 00:17:31.530
And finally, the crisis
responders and aid workers who

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:33.470
arrive to help.

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:35.425
We're looking at the needs of
each of these groups, and

00:17:35.425 --> 00:17:38.206
particularly where
they overlap.

00:17:38.206 --> 00:17:40.850
For those directly affected by
the crisis, the most important

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:45.190
thing is the status of their
friends and family.

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:48.660
Getting access to information
in a crisis is challenging,

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:52.100
specifically trustworthy
information.

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:55.850
They also want to know, how do
they tell other people that

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:57.480
they're OK?

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.590
Where can they go for help?

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:01.600
And what's the status of
resources, like medical

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.160
facilities, power,
roads, public

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.446
transportation, shelters?

00:18:06.446 --> 00:18:09.890
And finally, those directly
affected by the crisis are

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:13.770
often the first line of
crisis responders.

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:16.880
They want to be able to help,
but I think technology can do

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:22.810
a better job of telling them
where they should be to help.

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:25.080
For those indirectly affected by
the crisis, again, the most

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:29.140
important thing is what is the
status of my friends and

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.090
family that are affected?

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:34.510
They also want more detailed
information from the ground,

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:36.980
reports from victims.
What is happening?

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:39.336
These people also want
to be able to help.

00:18:39.336 --> 00:18:43.010
They each often have unique
knowledge of the language, the

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:45.850
culture, the geography
of the area.

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:48.520
You saw that Open Street Map
example, tapping into the

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.270
Haitian Diaspora to improve
the base maps in Haiti.

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:53.280
And we think there's a lot of
other ways to leverage this

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:58.255
highly-motivated group of
individuals using technology.

00:18:58.255 --> 00:19:01.250
And the needs of crisis
responders is actually where

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:08.060
developer tools might help the
most. Most crisis responders

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:10.060
don't have technology
backgrounds.

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:12.820
But at the same time, they have
to be able to collect and

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:16.540
analyze a lot of data to
figure out how best to

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:18.380
distribute aid.

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:21.620
They need better tools to
visualize survey data,

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:23.740
determining what other
responders in the area are

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:26.750
doing, and how they can
share data with them.

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:29.710
Figure out where their own
staff and supplies are.

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:32.940
It makes sense of the torrents
of crowd source and social

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:35.090
media data that's coming in.

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:36.700
I think there are better
tools that we can

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:39.400
design to help these.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:42.340
You might already be thinking,
what is someone from your

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:43.000
background?

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.420
What are some of the things
that you could do?

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:49.180
How could you build some tools
to help these people and help

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:50.295
meet these needs?

00:19:50.295 --> 00:19:53.340
I want to walk you through some
of the standards and some

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:56.250
of the tools that our
team is working on.

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:59.030
You notice three common themes
in the standards that I'm

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:00.500
talking about.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:03.160
First, simple.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:07.050
Crises obviously are stressful
situations.

00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:09.320
People aren't thinking
straight.

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:12.130
As much as possible, the tools
that you work on and that get

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:14.920
used in a crisis have
to be simple.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.270
And even better if
they're familiar.

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:19.540
They use things that people
already use in

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:21.980
their everyday lives.

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.960
Second is standard.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.490
As much as possible, we want
to use and promote common

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:29.260
standards to enable different
organizations to

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:31.240
inter-operate.

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:36.850
Finally open, open data
licenses, open APIs, open

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:42.990
source code, open systems really
win in this space.

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:46.840
Person Finder is a great example
of these three themes.

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.220
It also meets one of the key
needs that we saw from

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:51.500
multiple user groups:
finding the status

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:53.650
of friends and family.

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:57.220
Now Person Finder is an App
Engine application, but more

00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:00.670
important is the data standard
that underlies it, Person

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:04.390
Finder Interchange
Format, or PFIF.

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:07.700
PFIF was created after Hurricane
Katrina by Ka-Ping

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:11.860
Yee, one of Google.org's
first engineers.

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:14.400
And again, as Prem mentioned,
the major design principle

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.990
behind PFIF was convergence,
bringing data together from

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:23.120
multiple different sources
and systems.

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:26.200
For something like this to work,
data has to be traceable

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.640
back to its original source
because data might have

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:31.950
unknown reliability
or accountability.

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:34.360
PFIF also assumes that there's
no central authority, so if

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.260
you're an aggregator of this
data, you can decide which

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:38.890
data sources to trust.

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:41.800
But in a system like this,
duplicates are inevitable.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.100
You're going to have missing
person records

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:44.270
for the same person.

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:47.400
So the format has to be able
to handle that and resolve

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.386
duplicates.

00:21:48.386 --> 00:21:51.480
The data model for Person
Finder is very simple.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.900
There's just two types
of records.

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:56.770
First is, a person record.

00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:58.560
This is entered by someone who's
looking for a missing

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.110
person, or you can actually
enter a person record for

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:04.720
yourself if you want other
people to know that you're OK.

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.110
Then there's a note record.

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:08.870
And this is entered by anyone
else that has a status update

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:10.340
about that person.

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:12.350
There can be multiple note
records for every person

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:15.563
record, and note records are
also used to resolve

00:22:15.563 --> 00:22:19.280
duplicates between different
persons.

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.275
Person Finder has a data API.

00:22:21.275 --> 00:22:24.290
It's built on XML,
REST, and Atom.

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:26.235
Simple powerful standards
I'm sure many of you

00:22:26.235 --> 00:22:28.720
are familiar with.

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.825
And it is used in many
Google tools.

00:22:30.825 --> 00:22:33.300
The search API allows you to
enter all or part of a

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:36.780
person's name and get back the
person and note records for

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:37.880
that person.

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:41.250
There's a read API where
you can enter the

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:42.100
identifier for a person.

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:44.440
Or get an Atom feed of all
the person records or

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:46.180
all the note records.

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:47.720
And then there's a write API.

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:51.150
You can start person records
and note records as XML and

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:55.340
HTTPS posts them, along with
an authorization token.

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:58.730
Any of you can try out this API
right now by going to our

00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:00.360
test instance at
googlepersonfinder.appspot.com.

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:08.160
The user interface to Person
Finder is fast and simple.

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.140
If you're searching for
someone, just say I'm

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:11.490
searching for someone.

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:13.560
You enter their name.

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:16.420
You'll get all the records that
match this person's name.

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:17.420
Find the correct record.

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:19.660
On the left-hand side you'll
see the person record.

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:21.515
On the right-hand side you'll
see all the note records for

00:23:21.515 --> 00:23:22.950
that person.

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:26.330
You can also enter a new record,
a new note, if you

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:29.930
have a status update
for that person.

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:32.650
Person Finder is an open source
project hosted at

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:36.470
code.google.com at Google
Person Finder.

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:39.880
If you'd like to help, you can
go to the site, check out the

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.950
code, play with the API, or
maybe pick up an issue from

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:46.380
our issues list. There's also
a mailing list that's

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:49.160
available if you have
any questions.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.750
The next set of user needs that
we're looking at is the

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:53.930
status of resources.

00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:56.330
And in Haiti, we saw a number
of different organizations

00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:59.210
trying to collect this
information.

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:02.380
The US Army was surveying
the status of roads.

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:04.210
The World Health Organization
was trying to figure out which

00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:05.255
hospitals were open.

00:24:05.255 --> 00:24:08.000
And the Red Cross was tracking
the status of what shelters

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.330
were being built and where.

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:14.110
This information was useful
to crisis responders.

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:17.850
And we found that they were
sharing it by passing email

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:20.920
and emailing each other
spreadsheets.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:24.600
This method, crisis responders
spent a lot of time merging

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:27.210
rows together, copying and
pasting between spreadsheets,

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:30.470
doing a lot of things that
a database could do.

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:33.280
Not only is this inefficient,
but it doesn't keep up with

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:37.530
the rapid pace of change
in a crisis situation.

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:40.320
So what if we could
automate this?

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.230
Both the merging of data in
spreadsheets and also the

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:46.010
exchange of data between
organizations.

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:49.460
We can make it a lot faster
and simpler for people to

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:54.260
understand the current status
of resources in a disaster.

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:57.100
We envision a project called
Resource Finder.

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:59.860
The goal to enable structured
updates, information about

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:03.340
resources in near real-time
from multiple sources.

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:06.166
So what's the simplest possible
way to do this?

00:25:06.166 --> 00:25:09.820
We start with multiple sources,
each with information

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:12.510
about one specific
type of resource.

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:14.960
If anyone wants to add
something, remove something,

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:18.830
or change something, it would
publish that change.

00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:21.290
The change could then be
broadcast to anyone who's

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:23.412
interested in receiving it.

00:25:23.412 --> 00:25:26.260
Now for this to work, everyone
needs to have the same

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:29.180
identifier for a resource,
call that a record.

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:33.070
And users will also want to
know which source made the

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:33.950
change, right?

00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:36.330
So you also have to tag each
change with an author.

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:39.240
Finally, these changes may come
out of order, so they

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:41.530
also need a time stamp.

00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:42.240
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:45.890
for this change, you just know
what changed, who changed it,

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:47.990
and when did it change?

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:50.340
Imagine a stream of
these changes.

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:52.540
If you have that, you should
be able to just merge them

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:55.825
together to create the current
status of all the resources.

00:25:55.825 --> 00:25:59.260
You take a specific example
of hospital facilities.

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:02.143
Say the Army again, from a
survey they did in March, and

00:26:02.143 --> 00:26:05.050
it was the status of
the road access.

00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:08.980
The Red Cross knows which
hospitals are open and how

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.560
many beds are available from a
survey they did last month.

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:15.630
Let's say maybe a specific
doctor knows there was a road

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:16.960
washed out yesterday,
and now there are

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.720
more patients available.

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:21.810
Using the authored information
and the time send information,

00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:24.270
you can merge all the columns
together and merge all the

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:27.040
rows together to
get the current

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:29.850
status of all the resources.

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:32.060
And imagine multiple
applications publishing and

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:35.220
subscribing to this information,
using an open

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:38.490
protocol like PubSubHubbub,
which was announced at Google

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:40.260
IO last year.

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:42.590
Some of these subscribing
applications could send email

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:45.230
or SMS when a hospital
is out of beds.

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:47.000
Or maybe it's just an online
spreadsheet that your

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.960
organization wants to
keep up-to-date.

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:51.040
Maybe it's an instance of
Ushahidi that I want to keep

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:52.960
up-to-date.

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.850
We built a project called
Resource Finder on App Engine.

00:26:55.850 --> 00:27:00.160
And we focused initially on
hospital facilities in Haiti.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:03.730
It turns out this actually
wasn't that well adopted.

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:06.240
Organizations liked receiving
this information in near

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.740
real-time, but they didn't
want to have

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:10.190
to learn a new tool.

00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:12.800
So we're rethinking
our work here.

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.820
We're trying to extract the
core ideas from Research

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:17.640
Finder into a protocol that we
can integrate into tools that

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.700
are already being used
on the ground.

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:22.860
We're calling this Tablecast.

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:25.230
The name comes from the fact
that most data is in tables,

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:28.100
and we want to be able
to broadcast it.

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:29.482
It's an Atom extension.

00:27:29.482 --> 00:27:32.200
It represents a stream of
changes to a data set.

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:35.290
And since it's Atom, it also
integrates very well with a

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:37.976
PubSub protocol like
PubSubHubbub.

00:27:37.976 --> 00:27:42.300
And just like before, it
represents what changed to

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:47.046
what record, who changed it,
and when did it change.

00:27:47.046 --> 00:27:49.290
We're still actively developing
this application.

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:53.770
We're looking to build libraries
and tools to

00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:55.520
integrate this into
what's already

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:56.510
being used on the ground.

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:59.540
If you're interested in this
specification, or want to

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:01.810
participate in the working
group, you can check out

00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:03.060
Tablecast.org.

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:06.640
The next group of user needs
we're looking at is their

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:10.770
access to public alerts
and warnings.

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:14.350
The problem we see here is that
many organizations that

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:17.110
produce these alerts use their
own format and their own

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:22.190
distribution mechanisms.
Some have publish

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:23.590
alerts to their website.

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:25.840
Some have a Twitter feed,
or an RSS feed.

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:27.290
Some offer email
subscriptions.

00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:30.340
Some don't have information
like this online at all.

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:32.880
It would obviously be much
better if all this information

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:36.420
was online in a standard
format.

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:39.290
It turns out, there is such
a format called the Common

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:41.442
Alerting Protocol.

00:28:41.442 --> 00:28:45.540
It's an XML specification that
normalizes formats across many

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:47.840
different types of
alert messages.

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.940
It offers flexible targeting.

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:55.150
Things like language, category,
geographic area.

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:57.470
CAP was developed in conjunction
with over a

00:28:57.470 --> 00:28:59.660
hundred emergency managers.

00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:02.090
And it's been adopted as an
international standard by

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:04.320
OASIS and the ITU.

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:06.360
Organizations like the National
Weather Service and

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:09.280
US Geographic Survey already
produce alerts--

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.150
feeds of alerts--

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:12.420
in the CAP format.

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:15.090
We're working with many other
organizations to standardize

00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:17.405
their alerts as CAP.

00:29:17.405 --> 00:29:21.440
And we've open sourced a JAVA
library and some tools to help

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.460
get alerts into the
CAP format.

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:26.930
We're also trying to standardize
how alerts are

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:29.870
distributed across the web.

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:33.220
We're encouraging providers of
alerts to produce Atom feeds

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:34.590
in the CAP format.

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:37.110
We're going to aggregate them
at a common instance of

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:41.572
PubSubHubbub that we're
calling Alert Hub.

00:29:41.572 --> 00:29:45.190
The final standard I want
to mention is KML.

00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:47.170
I'm sure many of you are
familiar with it.

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:50.430
Our goal here is to get
information related to a

00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:55.060
disaster on the web in open
formats before the next

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:57.700
disaster strikes.

00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:00.730
One tool that we found to be
particularly helpful with this

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:03.400
is Google's Fusion Tables.

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:07.260
There's a session in this room
at 1:15 about Fusion Tables

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:09.800
that I would encourage
you all to attend.

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.230
Fusion Tables have some
awesome features.

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:14.520
There's two things that we like
about it the most. The

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:17.490
first is that it's
really simple.

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:19.890
If you have a spreadsheet and
it has a column for latitude

00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:21.590
and a column for longitude.

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:23.316
Or it just has one column
for addresses.

00:30:23.316 --> 00:30:25.540
You just upload that spreadsheet
to Fusion Tables,

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:27.830
and you immediately have
a map that you can

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:30.514
share across the web.

00:30:30.514 --> 00:30:32.110
The next thing with
Fusion Tables we

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:34.180
like is that it scales.

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:36.100
It scales to tens of thousands,
hundreds of

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:38.310
thousands of rows
in your data.

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:41.310
And it also scales in terms of
queries per second for people

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:43.190
accessing your data.

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:46.900
We see this kind of traffic
on our landing pages.

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:50.120
And we've had situations where
we haven't been able to link

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:52.600
to data on somebody else's
website, even if

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:53.300
it was really good.

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:55.296
Because we were afraid of
bringing that site down.

00:30:55.296 --> 00:30:57.810
If the data is on Fusion Tables,
we don't have to worry

00:30:57.810 --> 00:30:59.640
about that.

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:01.330
Fusion Tables also works
really well with

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:02.690
the Google Maps API.

00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:05.480
This code's actually from one of
the pages that we launched

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.130
responding to a crisis.

00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:10.450
You can see it's actually
really easy.

00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:15.210
In Fusion Tables, the URL has
an ID for a Fusion Table.

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:18.140
And inside the Maps API, there's
something called a

00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:19.030
Fusion Table Layer.

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:21.020
It's a first-class
citizen there.

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:24.760
You just plug in the ID to
create a Fusion Table Layer,

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:27.830
set the map to that layer, and
you automatically can render

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:31.510
thousands of points,
server side, just

00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:33.390
like Google Maps does.

00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:35.600
This also works really well
for polygon data.

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:37.290
So you can display heat maps
and things like that.

00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:38.930
Fusion Tables is really
powerful and really

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:42.380
well-integrated into
our tools.

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:43.900
So to sum up some of the
standards that we've been

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:45.070
talking about.

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:47.050
Person Finder Interchange
Format for

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:48.460
missing person's data.

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:50.640
Table CAPS for enabling
real-time

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:52.180
updates to tabular data.

00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:54.610
The common alerting
protocol for

00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:56.450
public alerts and warnings.

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:59.252
And KML for geographic data.

00:31:59.252 --> 00:32:01.500
We want to keep things simple.

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:03.232
We want to promote
these standards.

00:32:03.232 --> 00:32:06.080
And we want to promote
openness.

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:10.670
Open APIs, open data,
open source code.

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:14.225
Open systems win.

00:32:14.225 --> 00:32:15.475
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:21.790
PREM RAMASWAMI: Thanks Steve.

00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:25.530
So Steve just gave us a deep
dive into a lot of the tools

00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:27.850
we've been working on over
the last year and a half.

00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:30.800
And what I wanted to talk about
was how these were all

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:35.190
very useful during a recent
crisis response.

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:39.630
On March 11 of this last year,
there was an 8.9 magnitude

00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:42.780
earthquake that struck
northern Japan in

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:44.042
their Sendai Province.

00:32:44.042 --> 00:32:46.970
Now this earthquake was so large
that the earth literally

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:49.170
moved four inches on its axis.

00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:53.670
And the island of Japan moved
six feet closer to California.

00:32:53.670 --> 00:32:56.720
We immediately sprung into
action, wanted to collect

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:59.200
imagery over the affected
region.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:01.910
The video you're seeing playing,
the top part is

00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:03.865
imagery from 2009.

00:33:03.865 --> 00:33:06.890
The imagery at the bottom is
aerial imagery we collected

00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:07.870
with a fleet of planes.

00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:09.490
Now this imagery had enough
resolution to

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:11.200
see individual cars.

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:14.330
But more importantly, it showed
us the level of damage

00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:15.970
and destruction that
had been created.

00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:20.520
Entire cities were completely
wiped off the map.

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:22.350
Now seeing this level
of devastation,

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:23.380
we had a real question.

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:25.870
Would the internet be
able to withstand a

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:27.450
disaster of this magnitude?

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:30.106
And so we turn to our traffic
graphs again.

00:33:30.106 --> 00:33:32.630
Now you can see a slight dip
in traffic occur in the

00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:34.990
immediate time of
the earthquake.

00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:37.680
But this rebounds back to
pre-earthquake levels almost

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:39.280
that day itself.

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:40.530
And it wasn't just graphs.

00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:42.670
There were stories from the
ground that told us this.

00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:46.320
This is an open letter of thanks
we received from Ruth

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:50.010
Shiraishi, a Google user
in Tokyo, Japan.

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:53.620
And Ruth told us that on March
11, our technology helped

00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:55.780
change her life.

00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:59.560
So in her words, at 2:46 PM
when the earthquake struck

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:02.630
Japan, our phones would
not connect.

00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:05.490
Our desktop email systems
would not go through.

00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:07.230
Our phones SMS would not work.

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:09.040
But Gmail connected.

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:12.030
Gmail connected us with each
other in the company, to our

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:15.380
loved ones around Tokyo, and
worried family and friends

00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:16.560
around the world.

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:17.820
And it wasn't just Gmail.

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:19.150
It was other internet sites.

00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:20.000
It was Twitter.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.110
It was Facebook.

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:23.350
It was the power of the internet
to connect people in

00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:24.920
the aftermath.

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:28.460
Now when you people were going
online to find information,

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:30.550
and we knew there was also a
tsunami alert that had been

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:34.520
issued for most of the Pacific
Rim countries, and so Google

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:36.300
decided to use Google.com--

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.320
which gets billions of
eyeballs every day--

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:39.484
as an alerting platform.

00:34:39.484 --> 00:34:42.900
So we launched this line of text
that was a tsunami alert

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:44.270
in four different languages--

00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:47.469
Spanish, English, Japanese,
and Russian--

00:34:47.469 --> 00:34:51.760
to warn users that a tsunami was
approaching their areas.

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.870
Now we said that we knew people
come online to find

00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:54.460
this information.

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:56.850
I wanted to prove
that with data.

00:34:56.850 --> 00:34:59.510
So these are our search queries
for the specific term

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:02.710
tsunami coming from the island
of Hawaii over the last year

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:03.150
and a half.

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:06.410
And you see two very distinct
peaks in this graph.

00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:09.190
The first one occurs on February
27, after the Chile

00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:11.320
earthquake and subsequent
tsunami warning.

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:14.050
And the second one occurs on
March 11, after the Japan

00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:15.300
earthquake.

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:15.680
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:18.130
zoom in on March 11.

00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:20.620
So again, these are specific
queries related to tsunami

00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:22.745
coming from the island
of Hawaii.

00:35:22.745 --> 00:35:26.620
At around 7:56 PM, the Pacific
Tsunami Warning Center issues

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:27.440
a tsunami warning.

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:30.710
And you start seeing a slight
uptake in queries, which turns

00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:32.930
into an extremely large peak.

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:35.970
Now this dies down as people
fall asleep, but you see a

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:38.090
secondary peak occur
around 3:00 AM.

00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:40.145
And the reason this is important
is because at 3:11

00:35:40.145 --> 00:35:42.510
AM the first tsunami
wave hits the

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:44.685
westernmost island of Kauai.

00:35:44.685 --> 00:35:47.970
So people are coming online to
find information and see how

00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:49.220
this affects them.

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:54.020
Now this peak dies down again
at 4:08 AM after the tsunami

00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:56.180
wave leaves Hawaii and starts
heading towards the west

00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:57.110
coast of the US.

00:35:57.110 --> 00:36:01.730
Now this peak represents over
20% of queries from the island

00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:04.190
of Hawaii, which is an extremely
large number.

00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:06.780
And it's not just graphs
that tell the story.

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:09.070
This is a Reddit post that said
I don't know if this is

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:10.530
new, but this is a
Google feature I

00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:12.020
can really get behind.

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:16.470
And there's a comment on the
bottom from a user whose

00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:18.460
mother lives in Hawaii.

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:20.730
And they note that, because they
opened their browser in

00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:22.260
the morning, they were aware
that there was a

00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:24.680
tsunami alert issued.

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:27.400
Now Steve pointed out one of
the key needs from people

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:29.060
after a disaster is
getting in touch

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:30.990
with friends and relatives.

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:33.500
And so we once again launched
Google Person Finder.

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:36.000
Now over the course the last
year and a half, the tool has

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.430
been pre-translated in
40 plus languages.

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:41.660
So we were able to launch it in
Japanese within hours after

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:43.250
the earthquake.

00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:45.630
Over the course of the first few
weeks, Person Finder ended

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:49.790
up aggregating over 600,000
missing persons records.

00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:52.550
A partner with major
organizations like NHK, the

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:55.890
national broadcaster in Japan,
as well government bodies like

00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:58.910
the Japanese National Police.

00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:02.840
In the first seven days alone,
we were able to push 22

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:05.360
different releases
to Person Finder.

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:09.710
And this included features such
as the ability to search

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:12.020
in local Japanese
character sets.

00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:14.530
The ability to be compatible
with the local tier two phones

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:17.040
in Japan, as well as features
like being able to subscribe

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.970
to a specific record.

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:22.360
And this is because App Engine
gives you this great ability

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:23.780
to rapidly prototype.

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:26.740
And web applications also allow
you to quickly make

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:29.230
these changes on live tools.

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:32.200
This is actually our App Engine
dashboard a few hours

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:34.560
after the tool was launched.

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:37.030
And what you're seeing
is a peak in users

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:38.400
coming to the site.

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:40.550
This actually peaks
at a little below

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:43.150
1,500 queries per second.

00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:47.070
In terms of analytics, that's
about 36 million page views in

00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:49.390
the first two days alone.

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:52.390
Now what's important here is
App Engine can elastically

00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:54.740
grow to support this peak.

00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:56.520
Our engineers didn't
build a tool that

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:57.590
could scale like this.

00:37:57.590 --> 00:38:00.880
And the fact is, crises have
tools that require this sort

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:04.160
of-- that need this sort
of elastic capability.

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:06.420
The fact is the tools often
like dormant for a large

00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:10.130
amount of time until
the crisis occurs.

00:38:10.130 --> 00:38:12.950
We again launched the landing
page to aggregate information

00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:16.320
like Person Finder, donations,
relevant maps, as well as

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.860
real-time user generated
content.

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:21.970
But we also had a learning
information on this page, such

00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:24.890
as rolling power outages that
were occurring throughout

00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:28.050
Japan as well as transit
outages.

00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:31.160
Now, I wanted to point out that
one of the sites we link

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:33.290
to from this site-- again, it's
not just Google, it was

00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:34.250
sinsai.info.

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:36.200
And this is the local
Ushahidi platform.

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:40.120
Again Ushahidi was that incident
reporting platform.

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:42.350
What's interesting, though, is
Ushahidi was launched by a

00:38:42.350 --> 00:38:44.770
group of local volunteer
developers.

00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:48.760
Because the tool was simple to
use and open source, local

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.300
developers could pick it up,
translate it, and launch it

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:53.430
for the Japanese public.

00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:54.690
And we also wanted
to make other

00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:56.700
mapping information available.

00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:58.510
And so what we did was we
decided we wanted to put

00:38:58.510 --> 00:39:02.030
shelter information on a common
map, as one example.

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:04.420
Now shelter information was
strewn across numerous

00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:07.120
government websites, state
government websites in formats

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:08.580
such as PDF.

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:10.960
So we scraped this information,
pushed it to a

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:15.180
Fusion Table, and then made it
available in one location.

00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:17.660
Now it's really important to see
information like shelter

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:20.000
information on a map so you
know which shelter is

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.520
geographically closest to you.

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:24.050
There was something else
interesting that was

00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:26.240
occurring, though, at
these shelters.

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:29.235
People were maintaining written
lists of people who

00:39:29.235 --> 00:39:32.540
had come to the shelters, and
posting it on common walls at

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:33.040
these shelters.

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:35.740
Now this was essentially their
version of Person Finder, and

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:37.870
it was again siloed
per shelter.

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:40.410
And we wanted to be able to
sync this up to the online

00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:42.300
Person Finder tool.

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:45.280
So a group of engineers and
product managers in our office

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:48.650
in Japan decided to get
volunteers to go to the

00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:51.680
shelters, take pictures of the
lists, and upload them to a

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:54.820
simple-to-use common
Picasa album.

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:57.430
And then we had volunteers
come and transcribe these

00:39:57.430 --> 00:40:00.970
specific photographs and the
names on them, and post them

00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:02.890
to the comments, which
we then pushed

00:40:02.890 --> 00:40:05.050
back into Person Finder.

00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:07.310
Over the course of a few weeks,
we ended up processing

00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:12.060
over 9,000 photographs and
updating 137,000 names in

00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:14.020
Person Finder.

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:16.370
This was possible because we
had thousands of volunteers

00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:18.870
from outside of Google who
were able to help us out.

00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:21.180
And we were able to manage
that queue by building a

00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:25.310
simple tool that handed out
tasks to them over App Engine.

00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:26.920
Again, I said this was possible
because we had this

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:29.660
great team of product managers
and engineers in Tokyo who

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:31.470
worked tirelessly
for three weeks.

00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:33.810
This is them taking a pizza
break a few days after the

00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:35.100
earthquake.

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:36.870
And it was really inspirational
work.

00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:38.830
They had over 40 launches
that they did.

00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:41.980
But at the end of the day, any
of you as developers could've

00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:42.990
taken part.

00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:46.880
Because most of the work that
they did was simple via

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:50.450
standards and open
source tools.

00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:52.270
But we'll get back to that
point in a second.

00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:54.140
I wanted to point out what
is it that Google is

00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:55.690
looking to do next.

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:58.980
So this is an image from Google
Maps of me searching

00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:01.360
for tsunami Hawaii in the
aftermath of the earthquake.

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:03.790
And you can see the first result
is the Pacific Tsunami

00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:05.410
Museum Incorporated.

00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:06.930
Not very useful.

00:41:06.930 --> 00:41:08.880
So we want to be able to get
this alerting information

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:11.810
across all the properties on the
web that people go to to

00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:14.030
find information.

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:16.360
This is that same Reddit post.
And this is a comment at the

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:18.690
bottom of someone saying that
they didn't see the alert on

00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:20.050
their mobile phone.

00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:22.460
Why didn't their mobile phone
wake them up if they were

00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:25.460
asleep on the beach?

00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:29.280
Our landing page required
contributions from dozens of

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:31.470
Googlers around the globe
to get all this alerting

00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:34.400
information online and
in a common format.

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:37.050
How can we get this information
in advance of the

00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:40.120
disaster so that we need not
have to do all the work after

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:42.170
the disaster to get
it out there?

00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:44.460
And so this is where I wanted
to pose a challenge to the

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:46.770
audience out there.

00:41:46.770 --> 00:41:48.930
At the end of the day, you're
all the developers with the

00:41:48.930 --> 00:41:52.450
great understanding of web
tools, whether that be mobile,

00:41:52.450 --> 00:41:55.840
the Maps API, Fusion Tables,
or even App Engine.

00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:58.910
And you really do have an
ability here to take part and

00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:00.310
make a difference.

00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:02.550
And I wanted to give a small
story of two web

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:04.480
developers in Pakistan.

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:06.770
So these two guys were a little
annoyed that India had

00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:09.530
better base maps than Pakistan
did on Google Maps, and they

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:11.545
decided they were going to
do something about it.

00:42:11.545 --> 00:42:13.860
So they got a bunch of friends
together, and they said we're

00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:15.870
going to start mapping
out Pakistan, and

00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:17.550
we'll start with Lahore.

00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:20.190
Now the time lapse photography
behind me gives you an idea of

00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:23.970
how this map grows out starting
in June 2008.

00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:25.990
It gets filled with volunteers
add data.

00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:29.970
This is completely crowd-sourced
data collection.

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:33.460
Now these two developers ended
up being the top Google Map

00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:34.530
Maker mappers in the world.

00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:38.740
But why this is important is
last August, Pakistan was

00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:40.510
inundated with floods
that covered

00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:42.680
over 20% of the country.

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:45.780
And Google Map Maker had better
base maps than the

00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:48.460
Pakistani military did.

00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:51.920
We were able to share this
data with [? UNICAP ?],

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:54.840
the UN's mapping organization,
which was then able to help

00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:58.260
aid organizations deliver aid
from point a to point b.

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:00.680
These are two web developers
with an idea to get friends

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:04.150
together that ended up
saving tons of lives.

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:05.680
And it's not just Google
in this space.

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:08.170
You can actually join the Crisis
Mappers Network, which

00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:10.900
is a group of volunteers they
get together and map out areas

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:12.400
in need of assistance.

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.150
We talked about how
useful Open Street

00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:16.430
Map was after Haiti.

00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:18.800
There are also specific
tech organizations.

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:22.020
We talked about Ushahidi,
InSTEDD, and FrontlineSMS. All

00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:25.840
three of these organizations
have open source code bases

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:29.050
and very large issue trackers
that could use developers like

00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:30.940
you to help them out.

00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:34.220
And to get your feet wet, you
can always join a local crisis

00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:38.280
camp that's held by Crisis
Commons all around cities

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:40.110
around the world.

00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:42.876
Now these crisis camps bring
together aid organizations as

00:43:42.876 --> 00:43:45.340
well as developers like yourself
to discuss problems

00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:48.340
and possible solutions.

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:53.510
Google, Microsoft, the World
Bank, Yahoo, and NASA all run

00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:55.690
the Random Hacks of
Kindness together.

00:43:55.690 --> 00:43:58.270
And so RHoK is a conference
that's a 72-hour global

00:43:58.270 --> 00:44:01.620
hack-a-thon that run in cities
across the globe that look to

00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:05.120
bring subject matter experts as
well as aid organizations

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:08.140
in the same location to pitch
problems to have developers

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:11.020
rapidly prototype and
create solutions.

00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:13.410
Now, don't worry, 72 hours,
there will be a lot of pizza

00:44:13.410 --> 00:44:14.670
and Red Bull also, there.

00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:19.290
And we actually have RHoK #3
running on June 4 and 5.

00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:20.300
This is RHoK #3.

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:22.800
It's actually the fourth RHoK,
but as every good geek knows,

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:27.220
you start counting from zero,
so that's why it's RHoK #3.

00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:29.820
I wanted to give an example
though of where a RHoK hack

00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:30.700
was super useful.

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:33.280
So there's this hack called
Chasm that came out of RHoK,

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:36.710
and it's to identify areas that
are prone to landslides.

00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:38.840
There was this huge equation
that a World

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:39.646
Bank engineer had.

00:44:39.646 --> 00:44:42.490
And you either needed to have
a PhD in math or a PhD in

00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:45.580
geology to actually understand
how to use it.

00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:47.610
Now what a bunch of developers
did was, they took that

00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:49.210
equation and they created
a simple web

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:50.620
application around it.

00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:53.240
So aid workers could actually
put this information in and

00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:56.270
know where to dig trenches to
avoid future landslides.

00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:57.490
It's a great example
of something you

00:44:57.490 --> 00:45:00.700
can do in 72 hours.

00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:03.550
Finally, there a lot of non tech
organizations out there

00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:04.900
though that could
use your help.

00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:07.160
And all crises are local.

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:10.060
I would encourage you to go talk
to your local Red Cross,

00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:12.570
your local fire department,
or your local sheriff's

00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:15.120
department and see where they
could utilize your help.

00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:17.530
Understand their processes.

00:45:17.530 --> 00:45:21.240
Help them switch from using
pen and pencil to using

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:24.890
internet technologies to solve
some of their problems.

00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:27.790
Maybe you could help get local
shelter information into

00:45:27.790 --> 00:45:31.170
Fusion Tables, local evacuation
route data into KML

00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:33.420
before the disaster
actually strikes.

00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:35.570
Maybe you can help your local
sheriff's department send out

00:45:35.570 --> 00:45:39.190
alerts using a format like the
Common Alerting Protocol.

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:42.700
I wanted to conclude by giving
you one final example of

00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:45.720
helping out in a
local disaster.

00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:48.870
First Responder is a tool that
helps fire chiefs understand

00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:53.090
the location of their staff
before, during, and after a

00:45:53.090 --> 00:45:54.990
fire response.

00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:57.430
Now it was built by John Riley,
who's a volunteer

00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:58.560
firefighter.

00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:00.970
And John definitely doesn't
consider himself a web

00:46:00.970 --> 00:46:03.720
developer, but he's dangerous
enough to code.

00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:06.560
So what John did was, he built
a tool that uses Google Voice

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:10.700
to accept incoming calls, then
uses Google Latitude to track

00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:12.840
the location of all
the firefighters.

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:16.170
It uses the Google Maps API
to give them turn by turn

00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:16.800
directions.

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:20.500
It uses App Engine to log
when everyone shows up.

00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:23.270
And it also actually makes
sure that everyone is

00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:26.140
accounted for after
the fire response.

00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:29.030
It's this great example of using
simple, standard, and

00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:33.440
open to solve a very important
local problem.

00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:35.540
First Responder is actually an
open source tool that you can

00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:38.550
find on code.google.com.

00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:42.150
So I wanted to conclude by
conveying to you my real

00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:45.820
excitement in this space, and
the possibilities that

00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:47.000
technology has here.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.420
I really believe we are at
this turning point where

00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:51.120
technology--

00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:53.150
widely accepted consumer
technologies--

00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:55.950
can really help and alleviate
suffering

00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:58.310
after a natural disaster.

00:46:58.310 --> 00:47:00.500
I think that all of us, whether
we're geeks, or

00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:03.500
developers, or citizens just
interested in doing good,

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:06.220
really have a chance to make
a difference here.

00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:08.560
I wanted to thank you
all for your time.

00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:10.330
Steve and I will be here for
the next 10 minutes if you

00:47:10.330 --> 00:47:11.400
have any questions.

00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:13.330
There are two mics set up
on the right and left.

00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:14.930
We'd be happy to answer them.

00:47:14.930 --> 00:47:15.959
Thanks again.

00:47:15.959 --> 00:47:17.209
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:27.970
PREM RAMASWAMI: No questions?

00:47:31.930 --> 00:47:33.850
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:35.790
I was wondering if you could
just talk a little bit about

00:47:35.790 --> 00:47:40.395
how you sort of alluded to
things like Ushahidi and other

00:47:40.395 --> 00:47:41.470
organizations.

00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:43.050
Talk a little bit about
verification.

00:47:43.050 --> 00:47:45.510
You know you have this great
crowd source data.

00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:48.030
You mentioned the Open
Street Maps in Haiti.

00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:50.910
All of this stuff, you know, I'm
from a media organization,

00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:53.260
and the issue of how do you
know how reliable this

00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:57.620
information is, you know,
at different stages.

00:47:57.620 --> 00:48:02.810
You have the source and the
output, but translating that,

00:48:02.810 --> 00:48:05.270
just, how do you guys
approach that?

00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:06.440
PREM RAMASWAMI: So this
is a great question.

00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:09.430
So the question is basically,
how do you make sure that your

00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:10.910
sources are correct
and verifiable?

00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:14.120
And the fact is, this is
an open area right now.

00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:17.720
So Ushahidi for example tries to
get more than one record so

00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:19.810
that they can verify that
something is happening there.

00:48:19.810 --> 00:48:23.930
open Street Map and Map Maker
use a version of moderation so

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:25.920
other people with local
knowledge can say yeah, this

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:26.975
is probably right.

00:48:26.975 --> 00:48:29.480
Now what's interesting is though
the power of the crowd

00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:33.100
is really able to reduce the
amount of spam or false

00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:34.850
reports that you seen in
a lot of these cases.

00:48:34.850 --> 00:48:37.370
Another good thing is, humans
tend to be good in these

00:48:37.370 --> 00:48:39.550
situations and you don't see
many of these cases.

00:48:39.550 --> 00:48:42.540
But they do exist. And I think
this is also a case where

00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:45.190
local aid organizations do
play an important role of

00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:47.780
providing that verification,
to make sure what's being

00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:49.030
provided is truthful.

00:48:52.610 --> 00:48:55.730
AUDIENCE: This is a
short followup.

00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:58.110
I'm wondering if you automate
the threshold for then

00:48:58.110 --> 00:48:59.500
publicizing information.

00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:02.200
In other words, you said
Ushahidi does multiple things.

00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:06.550
Like at what stage do you say,
OK, and is that programmatic?

00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:08.896
You know, how do you define, you
know, sort of in advance

00:49:08.896 --> 00:49:11.110
of it, of how do you find, OK
what's our threshold for

00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:13.480
saying, we think this is a valid
entry, we think this is

00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:14.540
not a valid entry?

00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:15.620
PREM RAMASWAMI: So you
can use a lot of

00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:16.710
signals from the internet.

00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:18.970
So there's actually this great
story of this group from them

00:49:18.970 --> 00:49:22.130
MIT that won the Red Balloons
Competition that

00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:23.220
was posted by DARPA.

00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:25.590
And this was to find red
balloons that showed up

00:49:25.590 --> 00:49:27.340
randomly around the country.

00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:31.500
And they used things like the
location of where the

00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:33.780
information was coming in, to
see whether, you know, the guy

00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:35.870
who says he knows where the
balloon as in California was

00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:38.120
actually sending it from
Oklahoma and was probably

00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:39.410
lying to them or not.

00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:41.290
So you can use signals like
this, and I think each

00:49:41.290 --> 00:49:43.960
organization uses different
levels of signals and a

00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:45.860
different threshold on where
they consider it

00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:46.980
OK to publish this.

00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:49.220
Now I should point out that,
in the case of publishing

00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:51.300
things like alerting data,
that we're interested in

00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:54.520
doing, we want to make sure that
comes from an authorized

00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.890
source-- a government agency
or someone who actually has

00:49:56.890 --> 00:49:58.530
knowledge of the situation.

00:49:58.530 --> 00:50:00.810
And that we're just a
dissemination channel for that

00:50:00.810 --> 00:50:02.380
information.

00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:03.630
Thanks.

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:08.090
AUDIENCE: It seems like your
tools are after the fact.

00:50:08.090 --> 00:50:10.675
What are you doing before the
fact, in terms of having

00:50:10.675 --> 00:50:15.880
people preregister, or a
Facebook app where you can

00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:18.396
register yourself with the
Google database so when a

00:50:18.396 --> 00:50:21.310
disaster does hit your area,
your friends know how to reach

00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:24.810
you and know that they have
the right record?

00:50:24.810 --> 00:50:26.830
PREM RAMASWAMI: So there is a
lot of work done by different

00:50:26.830 --> 00:50:29.280
groups on things like making
sure you have an in case of

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:32.640
emergency contact in your
phones, knowing what to do, or

00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:34.940
pre-education in
the aftermath--

00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:37.010
before a crisis actually
happens, like what to do when

00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:39.440
an earthquake happens,
things like that.

00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:41.790
One of the things that we're
doing specifically as Google

00:50:41.790 --> 00:50:42.930
is we're trying to get alerting

00:50:42.930 --> 00:50:44.310
information out there.

00:50:44.310 --> 00:50:47.130
So a key example of this would
be the tornadoes that hit at

00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:49.930
night in the southern part
of the US recently.

00:50:49.930 --> 00:50:52.080
We want to be able to give
alerts to people who are in

00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:53.950
that region who might
be asleep.

00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:56.220
Maybe we can eventually wake
them up to let them know that

00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:57.410
they should head to
their basement.

00:50:57.410 --> 00:50:59.570
So these are things that we
want to try to do the pass

00:50:59.570 --> 00:51:02.620
this information out in easier
format so people can read them

00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:04.091
regardless of what
they're using.

00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:11.500
AUDIENCE: Do we know the name of
those Pakistani developers?

00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:13.320
PREM RAMASWAMI: I do, but
I'm forgetting them.

00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:15.040
We can follow up later
though, and I can try

00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:18.010
to get them to you.

00:51:18.010 --> 00:51:19.550
AUDIENCE: You mostly talked
about natural

00:51:19.550 --> 00:51:20.850
disasters until now.

00:51:20.850 --> 00:51:22.780
Can you relate to humanitarian
issues,

00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:24.810
or things like political?

00:51:24.810 --> 00:51:26.900
The issues we've seen and what's
Google's position on

00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:29.150
what you guys are doing
for things like this?

00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:32.150
PREM RAMASWAMI: So that's
a great question.

00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:34.460
The fact is that our team
is focusing right

00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:35.810
now on natural disasters.

00:51:35.810 --> 00:51:37.820
There have been a lot of them
lately, and it's keeping us

00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:39.100
pretty busy.

00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:41.790
The fact is, we have left the
door open though to work with

00:51:41.790 --> 00:51:44.160
humanitarian crises also.

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:46.730
We have done some work in the
past, for example, with Map

00:51:46.730 --> 00:51:50.250
Maker, to map out the southern
Sudanese region.

00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:51.920
There is a program with
George Clooney called

00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:53.380
Paparazzi in the Sky.

00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:55.560
The idea was have a satellite
over the area to prevent

00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:56.300
future violence.

00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:57.710
So we're looking at
areas like that.

00:51:57.710 --> 00:52:00.550
We think right now most of our
tools, though, do focus on

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:01.800
natural disasters.

00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:06.533
AUDIENCE: I was wondering if you
guys have reached out to

00:52:06.533 --> 00:52:10.220
the wide land firefighting
organizations.

00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:15.296
In my experience, they
constantly deal with these

00:52:15.296 --> 00:52:19.270
kind of disasters and have
some pretty good tools to

00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:20.530
support them.

00:52:20.530 --> 00:52:22.060
PREM RAMASWAMI: So actually
this is a very

00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:23.070
important area, too.

00:52:23.070 --> 00:52:25.330
And so I assume we're talking
about the wide forest fires

00:52:25.330 --> 00:52:26.400
and the groups that
fight those.

00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:29.860
So we do have some tools that
they use using Google Earth,

00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:32.660
for example, to be able to model
out wind patterns and

00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:35.260
how the fires are moving and
so that they can use this

00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:37.460
without needing an internet
connection as they're

00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:39.330
literally jumping out of
helicopters and things like

00:52:39.330 --> 00:52:40.480
that to fight these fires.

00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:42.840
And so we have some specified
tools for

00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:44.060
these different groups.

00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:46.200
The tools that we're building,
though, as a team, tend to

00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:48.790
more focus on general consumers
who are interested

00:52:48.790 --> 00:52:51.640
in finding information and
making sure that information

00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:52.890
is available to them.

00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:58.490
AUDIENCE: Just kind of going
back to you had talked the

00:52:58.490 --> 00:53:02.062
responders as a group that
didn't have great uptake

00:53:02.062 --> 00:53:03.046
during Haiti.

00:53:03.046 --> 00:53:05.180
And I know, as responders, they
have a bunch of tools

00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:08.500
that would probably give really
good requirements.

00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:11.090
So, something to
maybe look at.

00:53:11.090 --> 00:53:11.380
PREM RAMASWAMI: Definitely.

00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:12.620
We definitely will.

00:53:12.620 --> 00:53:13.870
Thanks.

00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:19.273
AUDIENCE: Have you been
playing with the--

00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:24.867
the timescale of a model that
you're working on, like in

00:53:24.867 --> 00:53:26.330
crisis, everything's
up in the air.

00:53:26.330 --> 00:53:28.680
And everybody needs to
fix it in a hurry.

00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:31.646
And when the crisis is over,
do you get to throw

00:53:31.646 --> 00:53:32.600
away all the data?

00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:34.360
Or you don't have
to worry about

00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:35.690
curating it quite as much.

00:53:35.690 --> 00:53:41.600
But if you spread out the
timeline, any curation becomes

00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:43.030
a bit more important.

00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:45.960
And the needs become
a bit more diverse.

00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:47.630
So like, chaos mapping, instead

00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:49.990
of just crisis mapping.

00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:53.230
And also have you gotten
a lot of call to

00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:56.010
participate in war zones?

00:53:56.010 --> 00:53:58.940
PREM RAMASWAMI: So, going back
to the war zones issues.

00:53:58.940 --> 00:54:03.130
So we have been asked to help
out numerous times.

00:54:03.130 --> 00:54:05.230
Right now we're not experts
in those areas.

00:54:05.230 --> 00:54:06.930
And we don't really understand
them as well.

00:54:06.930 --> 00:54:08.250
So as I said, we're focusing on

00:54:08.250 --> 00:54:10.930
natural disasters currently.

00:54:10.930 --> 00:54:13.710
With your previous question
about wider mapping, I think a

00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:16.540
lot of the tools that we are
building are applicable in

00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:20.140
cases that are general crises
or in broader context.

00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:22.630
We might be focusing just on
this, but we try to keep kind

00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:25.120
of the vision a little broader,
so mapping is mapping

00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:26.370
at the end of the day.

00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:31.176
AUDIENCE: So I just was sitting
here, and it was real

00:54:31.176 --> 00:54:33.670
interesting that there were so
many people in this session.

00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:36.990
And wondered, and maybe I'm
making some assumptions that

00:54:36.990 --> 00:54:39.690
we all kind of care about
people and we care about

00:54:39.690 --> 00:54:43.800
helping people in crisis, is
there kind of a general group

00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:45.585
where-- because I was thinking
it would be awesome to be able

00:54:45.585 --> 00:54:47.870
to exchange business cards with
all of you, or make some

00:54:47.870 --> 00:54:50.300
sort of contact or connection
where we'd collaborate

00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:51.900
together generally.

00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:55.290
Not about a specific thing like
the People Finder or the

00:54:55.290 --> 00:54:56.865
alerts, but in general?

00:54:56.865 --> 00:54:58.115
[INAUDIBLE]

00:55:10.630 --> 00:55:11.430
PREM RAMASWAMI: So let
me repeat that

00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:13.160
on the mic for everyone.

00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:15.250
Crisis Commons is the
group to join.

00:55:15.250 --> 00:55:17.740
So Crisis Commons at
googlegroups.com.

00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:18.890
It's a great group.

00:55:18.890 --> 00:55:19.620
I mentioned them earlier.

00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:21.800
They're the ones who host the
crisis camps in cities.

00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:24.570
But it's a great mailing list
to join to see, for example,

00:55:24.570 --> 00:55:27.230
people, state organizations
might email that group and say

00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:29.160
I have all this data on
an Excel spreadsheet.

00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:30.770
Can you help me put
it on a map?

00:55:30.770 --> 00:55:32.170
STEVE HAKUSA: Crisis Mappers
is also another

00:55:32.170 --> 00:55:32.880
group that we mentioned.

00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:36.670
If you have specific mapping
expertise, or GIF expertise,

00:55:36.670 --> 00:55:38.160
they're also another great
group to join.

00:55:40.746 --> 00:55:42.828
AUDIENCE: These are some really
awesome tools you guys

00:55:42.828 --> 00:55:43.472
put together.

00:55:43.472 --> 00:55:45.410
I'm a developer for a
news organization.

00:55:45.410 --> 00:55:47.437
When an event like an earthquake
takes place, is

00:55:47.437 --> 00:55:51.325
there a particular place we can
link to so I can tell the

00:55:51.325 --> 00:55:52.390
editorial team where
to go, just

00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:53.590
directly to Person Finder?

00:55:53.590 --> 00:55:56.620
Or do you guys actually have to
go create an event to say

00:55:56.620 --> 00:55:59.556
this earthquake has happened,
for example.

00:55:59.556 --> 00:56:00.310
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:56:00.310 --> 00:56:03.100
PREM RAMASWAMI: So let me talk
about the specific events.

00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:05.430
So usually, if the event is
big enough, if you go to

00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:07.600
Google.com, you should find
the information there.

00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:10.150
And so you should be able
to search for it on our

00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:12.630
properties or you'll see a
little link on google.com if

00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:14.890
it's a large event.

00:56:14.890 --> 00:56:18.420
The other place you can go is
google.org/crisisresponse.

00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:22.080
Is our site and we have recent
responses that are listed

00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:23.850
there, so you can kind of
get an idea of some of

00:56:23.850 --> 00:56:24.700
the stuff we do.

00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:25.930
STEVE HAKUSA: We'll
also be Tweeting

00:56:25.930 --> 00:56:27.015
anytime we do a big response.

00:56:27.015 --> 00:56:29.950
We'll definitely get it out
there [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:31.880
like what we're doing.

00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:33.320
PREM RAMASWAMI: And this is
really interesting, because

00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:36.140
the last time, when we launched
Person Finder, we

00:56:36.140 --> 00:56:37.320
Tweeted about it.

00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:39.215
We Tweeted about it a few
minutes after it launched.

00:56:39.215 --> 00:56:41.990
And we just saw the QPS spike.

00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:44.200
And I mean, I guess I should
know the power of Twitter

00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:45.030
because I work at Google.

00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:47.850
But I was again shocked to
see just how many people

00:56:47.850 --> 00:56:48.560
picked up on it.

00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:51.320
Before we even had a landing
page aggregated and ready to

00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:52.870
push, people were
using the tool.

00:56:57.630 --> 00:56:59.630
AUDIENCE: So with Maps,
there's a lot of IP

00:56:59.630 --> 00:57:01.040
involved with it.

00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:02.920
How do you guys deal with
that during the crisis?

00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:06.140
So, for example, the Pakistani
people have made the great

00:57:06.140 --> 00:57:08.248
base map that wasn't pushed
out into the community

00:57:08.248 --> 00:57:08.712
afterwards.

00:57:08.712 --> 00:57:10.660
It kind of just lives
in Google now.

00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:15.020
And for example, probably at
OSM, you guys didn't get that

00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:17.240
data, because it
was encumbered.

00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:19.910
So I deal with it every day.

00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:22.450
How do you guys deal with
nonprofit organization?

00:57:22.450 --> 00:57:25.380
Very carefully is probably
the solution.

00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:27.170
PREM RAMASWAMI: Yes, very
carefully is a good answer.

00:57:27.170 --> 00:57:29.220
But I want to give you a more
honest answer to that which is

00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:32.310
that we're always looking
to get better.

00:57:32.310 --> 00:57:33.750
And so this is definitely
a place where I

00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:35.270
think we can get better.

00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:38.460
Now, in addition to that, I
wanted to add though that this

00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:41.710
data is available over the
Maps API, for example.

00:57:41.710 --> 00:57:44.300
And that when there is a
disaster in a region, we do

00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:46.160
provide this data to
organizations like

00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:46.290
[? UNICAP ?]

00:57:46.290 --> 00:57:48.210
so they can can make it
available to all aid

00:57:48.210 --> 00:57:49.420
organizations.

00:57:49.420 --> 00:57:51.620
And so we'll continue to work on
this, and we'll continue to

00:57:51.620 --> 00:57:53.570
see if we can help
in this area.

00:57:53.570 --> 00:57:55.310
AUDIENCE: Just to follow
up, you guys probably

00:57:55.310 --> 00:57:55.820
know this as well.

00:57:55.820 --> 00:57:59.520
But you guys have been pushing
the aggregation of data as one

00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:00.940
of your goals.

00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:04.250
And when it comes to mapping
data, it's kind of frustrating

00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:07.850
because you can't aggregate
that data because someone

00:58:07.850 --> 00:58:08.580
might have--

00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:12.610
OSM might have a road that
someone got lazy and didn't

00:58:12.610 --> 00:58:14.470
put it into Map Maker
and vice versa.

00:58:17.470 --> 00:58:19.040
There's no answer, correct?

00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:20.410
PREM RAMASWAMI: We're
very aware of this.

00:58:20.410 --> 00:58:22.870
This is somewhere where we want
to be able to help out.

00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:25.310
AUDIENCE: Maybe the engineer
can answer this, but you've

00:58:25.310 --> 00:58:27.840
got something that your
table data might be

00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:30.400
able to use as non--

00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:30.970
STEVE HAKUSA: Table Caps?

00:58:30.970 --> 00:58:33.520
Yeah that's actually probably
a really good example.

00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:35.570
You can try to get these
different organizations to be

00:58:35.570 --> 00:58:37.620
sharing these updates between
these groups.

00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:38.870
Yeah, that's definitely.

00:58:41.618 --> 00:58:44.140
AUDIENCE: Middle-aged men like
myself will have a heart

00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:46.100
attack and get very interested
in their health because the

00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:47.612
crisis is acute.

00:58:47.612 --> 00:58:48.968
You go to the hospital.

00:58:48.968 --> 00:58:51.435
You go on the cholesterol
reducing drugs.

00:58:51.435 --> 00:58:54.290
But what about the chronic
crises, like ocean

00:58:54.290 --> 00:58:58.490
acidification, low-oxygen zones,
over-fishing, things

00:58:58.490 --> 00:59:00.310
that have the potential to
kill billions of people?

00:59:00.310 --> 00:59:01.960
There are certain scientific
organizations--

00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:05.470
I'm one of them-- we sit on
petabytes of data that could

00:59:05.470 --> 00:59:09.200
be used in front of crises in
a more offensive position,

00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:11.690
rather than defensive, waiting
for something to happen.

00:59:11.690 --> 00:59:14.700
Is your team at all interested
in those types of problems?

00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:17.560
PREM RAMASWAMI: So there's
actually a great Google.org

00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:19.315
project called Earth Engine.

00:59:19.315 --> 00:59:21.510
And what Earth Engine is trying
to do is take these

00:59:21.510 --> 00:59:24.530
petabytes of data regarding
the globes and push them

00:59:24.530 --> 00:59:26.520
together and get Google's
computing power to be able to

00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:27.740
conduct algorithms over.

00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:30.190
And one of the examples is one
of these chronic crises, which

00:59:30.190 --> 00:59:31.575
is deforestation.

00:59:31.575 --> 00:59:34.200
So using this globe of satellite
imagery from the

00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:36.950
last 30 or 40 years, you can
actually see deforestation

00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:38.120
occur in different areas.

00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:40.460
So there are different
Google.org teams that focus in

00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:42.740
these different areas.

00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:44.090
I wanted to thank everyone
for their time today.

00:59:44.090 --> 00:59:45.620
We're unfortunately
out of time.

00:59:45.620 --> 00:59:47.880
Steve and I will be around, kind
of off stage for a bit,

00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:49.030
if you have any followup
questions.

00:59:49.030 --> 00:59:50.350
You can feel free to find us.

00:59:50.350 --> 00:59:51.750
Thanks again for coming
out today.

00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:53.230
STEVE HAKUSA: Thanks a lot.
