Erika Larsen:
<i> The horse is this way</i>

00:00:37.903 --> 00:00:40.506
<i> to connect people with their
 dreams for the future</i>

00:00:40.506 --> 00:00:43.242
<i> with their land,
 with their culture,</i>

00:00:43.242 --> 00:00:45.511
<i> with what made them
 most proud...</i>

00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:47.913
<i> connected them
 with their ancestors...</i>

00:00:47.913 --> 00:00:50.984
<i> and to a history that wasn't
 so long ago for them.</i>

00:00:56.355 --> 00:01:00.793
( applause )

00:01:00.793 --> 00:01:02.962
The Native Americans had...

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:05.831
what many consider,
a short, but very intense

00:01:05.831 --> 00:01:08.534
200-year relationship
with the horse,

00:01:08.534 --> 00:01:10.770
which transformed their culture.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.872 line:0%
This might have existed,
the dates change a bit,

00:01:13.872 --> 00:01:17.544 line:0%
between the late 1600s until
the late 1800s.

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:20.980
But I was sent to look
at the modern day culture.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.149
Look at the horse
and how it existed today...

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.252
what was this relationship,
what did it mean to people.

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:27.453
<i> They showed me first</i>

00:01:27.453 --> 00:01:30.523
<i> it was a very deep
 spiritual connection.</i>

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:34.860
<i> The horse represented respect,
 pride, generosity,</i>

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.397
<i> strength, medicine, healing.</i>

00:01:38.397 --> 00:01:42.001
<i> I saw the horse
 as a symbol of pride.</i>

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:46.105
<i> It was used in pageantry,
 in parades, and in racing.</i>

00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:48.841
<i> And it was always adorned
 with the family or a tribe's</i>

00:01:48.841 --> 00:01:50.476
<i> best accoutrements.</i>

00:01:50.476 --> 00:01:53.713
<i> This regalia everyone was
 so proud to display,</i>

00:01:53.713 --> 00:01:55.815
<i> who they were
 and who their family was</i>

00:01:55.815 --> 00:01:57.583
<i> through the horse.</i>

00:01:57.583 --> 00:02:00.586
<i> I also saw it is a means of
 an economic way of life.</i>

00:02:00.586 --> 00:02:03.622
<i> A lot of families I met,
 got their children into rodeo,</i>

00:02:03.622 --> 00:02:05.190
<i> and these children are
 getting full rides</i>

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.493
<i> to college because of rodeo,</i>

00:02:07.493 --> 00:02:09.762
<i> because of their relationship
 to the horse.</i>

00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:13.766
But most important for me, or
what I saw as most profound, is

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:16.268
the horse was this way
to connect people

00:02:16.268 --> 00:02:19.138
<i> with their ancestors,
 with their land,</i>

00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:20.539
<i> with their culture,</i>

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:22.642
<i> with what made them
 most proud,</i>

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:25.611
<i> connected them with their
 dreams for the future.</i>

00:02:25.611 --> 00:02:28.614
<i> 'The Return Of The Native.'
 Every tribe I met said</i>

00:02:28.614 --> 00:02:29.782
<i> the horse has always
 been here.</i>

00:02:29.782 --> 00:02:31.717
<i> To be honest, I didn't know
 what they meant by that.</i>

00:02:31.717 --> 00:02:34.921
<i> Because to me,
 the horse came in 1400s.</i>

00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:36.823
<i> They said, 'No. The horse
 has always been here.'</i>

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:39.125
<i> The horse had been here
 10 million years ago.</i>

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:42.061
<i> It moved its way east
 before becoming extinct</i>

00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:43.930
<i> in the Americas,
 and did come back</i>

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.365
<i> with Christopher Columbus
 on his second journey.</i>

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.237
What I wanted to do is,
follow this path a little bit.

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:54.173
<i> So, I started in the south
 in Navajo Nation,</i>

00:02:54.173 --> 00:02:56.375
<i> where I met Jones Benally.</i>

00:02:56.375 --> 00:02:58.010
<i> And Jones is a medicine man</i>

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.812
<i> and he works
 in tribal health care.</i>

00:02:59.812 --> 00:03:01.414
<i> And he works along,
 what he calls,</i>

00:03:01.414 --> 00:03:03.183
<i> 'Western medicine.'</i>

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:07.486
But most of the patients
that come to him for help,

00:03:07.486 --> 00:03:11.323
gift him horses, still today...

00:03:11.323 --> 00:03:13.493
in exchange
for his services.

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:15.461
And a lot of these horses
that are given to him are...

00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:16.596
what are considered green,

00:03:16.662 --> 00:03:19.132
<i> or they haven't been ridden
 or not ridden very much.</i>

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:22.001
<i> And his son Clayson,
 works with these horses.</i>

00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:23.769
<i> Many of you here
 might have heard</i>

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.471
<i> what is called
 'breaking a horse.'</i>

00:03:25.471 --> 00:03:28.708
<i> But Clayson said to me,
 we don't break horses.</i>

00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:30.175
<i> He says,
 'I have no interest in</i>

00:03:30.175 --> 00:03:31.577
<i> breaking the spirit
 of a horse.'</i>

00:03:31.577 --> 00:03:33.346
<i> He said,
 'I need to understand a horse</i>

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:36.282
<i> to get to know the horse and
that's when I can ride a horse.'</i>

00:03:36.282 --> 00:03:39.284
<i> And he says, 'we employ...'
 if he wants to say,</i>

00:03:39.284 --> 00:03:41.788
<i> that way 'more gentler means.'</i>

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:44.223
<i> Clayson said to me,
 'when I can kneel down,</i>

00:03:44.223 --> 00:03:46.893
<i> and a horse can feel
 my breath, and I feel his,</i>

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:48.861
<i>that's when I've built the bond
 with the horse,</i>

00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:50.129
<i> that's when I can ride him,</i>

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:51.964
<i> and that horse
 is part of me forever</i>

00:03:51.964 --> 00:03:53.999
<i> and I'm part of him.'</i>

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:56.535
<i> Then I moved my way
 north a bit</i>

00:03:56.535 --> 00:04:00.939
<i> and I saw the Nez Perce horse
 or the Appaloosa.</i>

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:03.375
<i> Also at the Nez Perce land,</i>

00:04:03.375 --> 00:04:06.879
<i> I met Rosa and Jon Yearout.
 They have a program called</i>

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:08.815
<i> the Nez Perce Appaloosa
 Horse Club.</i>

00:04:08.815 --> 00:04:10.015
<i> And it is to get youth,</i>

00:04:10.015 --> 00:04:12.117
<i> tribal youth, involved
 with the horse.</i>

00:04:12.117 --> 00:04:13.820
Because to them, they believe

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.621
that when the youth become
involved in the horse,

00:04:15.621 --> 00:04:17.323
they become involved
in their culture,

00:04:17.323 --> 00:04:20.092
they become involved with
understanding their history,

00:04:20.092 --> 00:04:21.861
they understand
their land more

00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:24.864
and they understand
themselves more.

00:04:24.864 --> 00:04:26.933
<i> And Brooke Taylor,
 she is sixteen,</i>

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:30.402
<i> she said to me,
 'when I ride a horse...</i>

00:04:30.402 --> 00:04:31.904
( sobbing )

00:04:31.904 --> 00:04:35.441
<i> and I walk the trail
 that my ancestors did...</i>

00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:37.944
<i> I feel their suffering and</i>

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:41.680
<i> I know that's why
 I'm standing here today.'</i>

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.882
<i>She says, 'that's why I do this.</i>

00:04:42.882 --> 00:04:44.750
<i> That's why I'm connected
 to the horse.</i>

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.719
<i> I understand my people
 and my land</i>

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:48.554
<i> more than ever before.'</i>

00:04:50.956 --> 00:04:53.392
<i> And the horse mask.</i>

00:04:53.392 --> 00:04:56.195
<i> From the Nez Perce,
 I was definitely in awe of</i>

00:04:56.195 --> 00:04:58.598
<i> how they dressed their horses
 and I wanted to explore</i>

00:04:58.598 --> 00:05:00.266
<i> that a little bit more.</i>

00:05:00.266 --> 00:05:03.169
<i> And the horse mask was used
 for many reasons,</i>

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:06.238
<i> it is used in battle
 to intimidate an opponent.</i>

00:05:06.238 --> 00:05:07.973
Later it was used in hunting,

00:05:07.973 --> 00:05:10.042
sometimes it could be
a mask of a buffalo

00:05:10.042 --> 00:05:12.044
or the animal
that they were hunting...

00:05:12.044 --> 00:05:15.648
not so much to intimidate
the animal, but to,

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:17.316
to take the power
of that animal

00:05:17.316 --> 00:05:18.851
and try to understand it
and to be able to

00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:20.286
have a good harvest.

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:22.688
<i> I met a young boy
 named Adam Swetus</i>

00:05:22.688 --> 00:05:24.724
<i> and he wanted to show me
 his horse.</i>

00:05:24.724 --> 00:05:27.192
<i> And when I got there,
 he had tied the end up</i>

00:05:27.192 --> 00:05:29.528
<i> and put a hand print on it.
 I had seen the hand prints</i>

00:05:29.528 --> 00:05:33.466
<i> and different types of symbols
 on horses and other places</i>

00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:35.601
<i> and it meant something
 different to everyone.</i>

00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:36.969
<i> To Adam, he said,</i>

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:38.905
<i> 'the handprint meant
 ownership.'</i>

00:05:38.905 --> 00:05:41.006
And what he meant by
ownership, is he means that,

00:05:41.006 --> 00:05:43.075
this bond... horse,
belongs to me,

00:05:43.075 --> 00:05:45.244
he goes... but it also belongs
to my family.

00:05:45.244 --> 00:05:46.445
And he thought a little more
and he said,

00:05:46.445 --> 00:05:47.814
'it belongs to my tribe.'

00:05:47.814 --> 00:05:49.949
He said,
'it belongs to my people.'

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:52.652
So, very interesting idea
of what is ownership.

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:55.321
<i> I also met Katie Harris.</i>

00:05:55.321 --> 00:05:58.458
<i> She is Umatilla,
 Nez Perce, and Cayuse.</i>

00:05:58.458 --> 00:06:01.293
<i> And she is involved
 in the Indian pageantry</i>

00:06:01.293 --> 00:06:03.996
<i> and she showed me that
 it was a lot more than beauty.</i>

00:06:03.996 --> 00:06:06.498
<i>She said, 'for me to participate
 in these pageants,'</i>

00:06:06.498 --> 00:06:08.734
<i> She said, 'I have to have
 the knowledge of my language,</i>

00:06:08.734 --> 00:06:11.870
<i> I have to have a knowledge of
 my culture,' and she goes,</i>

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.072
<i> 'most importantly,
 the knowledge of my</i>

00:06:13.072 --> 00:06:15.107
<i> 'immediate family,
 my grandmother did this.</i>

00:06:15.107 --> 00:06:17.477
<i> 'I wanted to walk in the
 footsteps of my grandmother</i>

00:06:17.477 --> 00:06:18.944
<i> and understood
 why she did this</i>

00:06:18.944 --> 00:06:20.646
<i> and what she felt.'</i>

00:06:20.646 --> 00:06:22.548
<i> And of course, I went to
 Crow Fair.</i>

00:06:22.548 --> 00:06:25.217
<i> You can't... you want to learn
 something about the horse</i>

00:06:25.217 --> 00:06:26.586
<i> and not go to Crow Fair.</i>

00:06:26.586 --> 00:06:30.289
<i> And at Crow Fair
 I heard a very similar thing.</i>

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:33.325
<i> That when we are on a horse
 and we are wearing this,</i>

00:06:33.325 --> 00:06:35.761
<i> we are not in museum.
 It's not dead, it's living,</i>

00:06:35.761 --> 00:06:38.030
<i> and that's why we do this.</i>

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.198
I was able to make some video,

00:06:40.198 --> 00:06:42.100
and you can hear
the voice of

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.703
Jade Broncho,
he is Shoshone-Bannock.

00:06:43.703 --> 00:06:47.106
And he is going to tell us
what the horse means to him

00:06:47.106 --> 00:06:49.108
and to his culture.

00:06:49.108 --> 00:06:55.681

<i> When bad people are around,

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:29.348
<i> They are teachers,
 someone you can talk to...</i>

00:07:29.348 --> 00:07:31.450
<i> your best friend,</i>

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:34.553
<i> and some days,
 he's your only friend.</i>

00:07:35.254 --> 00:07:38.323
<i> When you are feeling bad,
 they are there.</i>

00:07:38.323 --> 00:07:40.726
<i> They take care of you,
 even when you don't know how.</i>

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.329
<i> They don't...
 they don't judge you.</i>

00:07:43.329 --> 00:07:45.097
<i> All they want is
 to be loved by you.</i>

00:07:45.097 --> 00:07:47.400
( laughter )

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:55.274
<i> They protect the little kids
because they are still innocent.</i>

00:07:55.841 --> 00:07:59.979
<i> But at the same time,
 they are just as naughty.</i>

00:08:00.512 --> 00:08:05.451
( crowd cheering )

00:08:08.887 --> 00:08:12.358
<i> A part of them becomes you
 and you become part of them.</i>

00:08:15.494 --> 00:08:17.463
<i> It's a strong bond
 that can't break.</i>

00:08:17.463 --> 00:08:22.335
( Native American singing )

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:32.544
I'll continue on...

00:08:32.544 --> 00:08:36.215
this is Phillip Whiteman.
What I found most interesting

00:08:36.215 --> 00:08:38.851
<i> and important about Phillip
 is his work with youth.</i>

00:08:38.851 --> 00:08:41.220
<i> He and his wife,
 Lynette Two Bulls,</i>

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.055
<i> hold a program
 on their ranch,</i>

00:08:43.055 --> 00:08:45.858
<i> on their home in Lame Deer,
 he's Northern Cheyenne.</i>

00:08:45.858 --> 00:08:47.293
<i> And he said to me
 'when I watch</i>

00:08:47.293 --> 00:08:48.961
<i> these little kids
 feed the horses,</i>

00:08:48.961 --> 00:08:51.130
<i> I'm very proud, because
 I know when they feed a horse,</i>

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:53.732
<i> they will learn
 to feed themselves.'</i>

00:08:53.732 --> 00:08:55.367
<i> It's the first time
 some of these kids</i>

00:08:55.367 --> 00:08:56.902
<i> will ever get to be
 on a horse,</i>

00:08:56.902 --> 00:08:58.570
<i> and they watch
 and they are really proud</i>

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:00.539
<i> when they watch their
 older brother get on the horse</i>

00:09:00.539 --> 00:09:02.041
<i> and they get very excited</i>

00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:03.475
<i> and it is something
 they really want to do</i>

00:09:03.475 --> 00:09:06.045
<i> and become really good at.</i>

00:09:06.045 --> 00:09:08.714
<i> On the Crow reservation,
 I met Michelle Walking Bear.</i>

00:09:08.714 --> 00:09:10.483
<i> She invited me
 to come stay with her</i>

00:09:10.483 --> 00:09:12.785
<i> and her family at their home
 for a little less than a week</i>

00:09:12.785 --> 00:09:15.988
<i> and, she said because
 'I want you to see that...</i>

00:09:15.988 --> 00:09:18.424
<i> I just want you to see
 the daily life with horses.'</i>

00:09:18.424 --> 00:09:20.292
She goes, 'you know,
it's not all about

00:09:20.292 --> 00:09:21.493
rodeos and parades,'

00:09:21.493 --> 00:09:24.263
she goes, 'we just
live with the horses.'

00:09:24.263 --> 00:09:26.198
<i> They live about an hour
 away from...</i>

00:09:26.198 --> 00:09:27.400
<i> from the main town,</i>

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.001
<i> so when her kids
 came from school,</i>

00:09:29.001 --> 00:09:30.169
<i> this is what they did.</i>

00:09:30.169 --> 00:09:33.039
<i> And I saw the horses
 as their playmates.</i>

00:09:34.106 --> 00:09:37.042
<i> And I saw that the horse
 carried the dreams</i>

00:09:37.042 --> 00:09:38.844
<i> and reflecting their dreams</i>

00:09:38.844 --> 00:09:42.114
<i> and making those dreams
 realities.</i>

00:09:43.115 --> 00:09:45.017
<i> Back on the Yakima
 Reservation,</i>

00:09:45.017 --> 00:09:47.786
<i> they hold what's called
 a 'Wild Horse Race'.</i>

00:09:47.786 --> 00:09:49.020
<i> They take green horses,</i>

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.656
<i> the horses that have
 never been ridden.</i>

00:09:50.656 --> 00:09:53.992
<i> They have children do it
 as well as adults.</i>

00:09:53.992 --> 00:09:55.761
<i> There's usually
 three people on a team</i>

00:09:55.761 --> 00:09:57.863
<i> and their point is you have to
 catch the horse,</i>

00:09:57.863 --> 00:10:00.132
<i> saddle it and ride it
 in shortest amount of time,</i>

00:10:00.132 --> 00:10:02.101
<i> and these horses are
 very wild.</i>

00:10:02.101 --> 00:10:04.102
<i> But what I found
 most interesting is that</i>

00:10:04.102 --> 00:10:06.405
<i> this horse race
 is a memorial horse race,</i>

00:10:06.405 --> 00:10:08.106
called the Heemsah Memorial
Horse Race

00:10:08.106 --> 00:10:11.176
<i> and has been going on
 for over 20 years.</i>

00:10:11.176 --> 00:10:13.412
It was meant originally
for their family

00:10:13.412 --> 00:10:17.049
to honor people that had died
that year in their family,

00:10:17.049 --> 00:10:18.951
but over the years
anyone from the tribe

00:10:18.951 --> 00:10:20.820
or anyone from the community
could come

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.656
and honor someone that
had died in that past year

00:10:23.656 --> 00:10:25.057
for this race.

00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:27.893
<i> This is on the Yakima
 Reservation</i>

00:10:27.893 --> 00:10:29.661
<i> and something I learnt
 when I was out there</i>

00:10:29.661 --> 00:10:32.097
<i> that there is a problem
 with wild horses.</i>

00:10:32.097 --> 00:10:34.333
<i> And, the men there
 told me that...</i>

00:10:34.333 --> 00:10:35.534
they said at some point
they had

00:10:35.534 --> 00:10:40.839
over 20,000 wild horses and
what it ultimately was doing...

00:10:40.839 --> 00:10:42.607
was devastating the land
and he said...

00:10:42.607 --> 00:10:44.877
'any biologist, anyone
knows anything about the land

00:10:44.877 --> 00:10:46.044
and that would not be me,'
he said,

00:10:46.044 --> 00:10:47.646
'would look at this picture
and know that

00:10:47.646 --> 00:10:49.448
it had been completely
devastated,'

00:10:49.448 --> 00:10:51.584
and he said 'for the tribe,
it is very important,

00:10:51.584 --> 00:10:52.784
because one,
this is their land,

00:10:52.784 --> 00:10:56.555
two, this is the place where
they dig for medicine, roots...'

00:10:56.555 --> 00:10:58.823
And he said and...

00:10:58.823 --> 00:11:00.092
there's way too
many horses

00:11:00.092 --> 00:11:01.794
and he goes, 'and also
you don't want to walk out

00:11:01.794 --> 00:11:03.595
and see a lot of
starving horses running around,'

00:11:03.595 --> 00:11:05.364
and he goes, 'and that's
what's happening,'

00:11:05.364 --> 00:11:07.365
And he said to me
'this is what happens

00:11:07.365 --> 00:11:09.601
when things are out of balance'
and he said,

00:11:09.634 --> 00:11:11.570
'so even something as
powerful the horse

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:13.605
<i> that represents, in my eyes
 on my journey,</i>

00:11:13.605 --> 00:11:15.874
<i> something really good</i>

00:11:15.874 --> 00:11:17.242
<i> and when things are
 out of balance,</i>

00:11:17.242 --> 00:11:19.278
<i> it also causes problems.'</i>

00:11:20.846 --> 00:11:22.814
I'm going end here.

00:11:22.814 --> 00:11:26.351
We have a special guest
tonight Leo Teton,

00:11:26.351 --> 00:11:28.988
but before I bring him up,
I have a very short video

00:11:28.988 --> 00:11:30.422
I want to show you of Leo

00:11:30.422 --> 00:11:32.792
just to be able to bring you
to his home for a minute or so.

00:11:33.726 --> 00:11:34.759
Up here on the stage

00:11:34.759 --> 00:11:36.528
you get one Leo,
but at home

00:11:36.528 --> 00:11:38.163
you get to see someone
very different

00:11:38.163 --> 00:11:40.466
when he works with horses.

00:11:40.466 --> 00:11:45.004
<i> Leo Teton:
 Come on! Come on!</i>

00:11:45.004 --> 00:11:50.943
( whistles )
<i> Come on! Come on!</i>

00:12:02.187 --> 00:12:06.792
<i> Come on!</i>
( whistles )

00:12:13.932 --> 00:12:16.168
<i> Come on...
 keep coming.</i>

00:12:16.168 --> 00:12:18.604
<i> Keep coming.</i>

00:12:23.308 --> 00:12:26.879
<i> There you go.
 Yeah. Yeah.</i>

00:13:00.645 --> 00:13:03.114
( applause )

00:13:03.114 --> 00:13:06.184
So Leo, for those of us
who don't know,

00:13:06.184 --> 00:13:08.086
tell us where you are from.

00:13:08.086 --> 00:13:12.825 line:0%
Well first of all, my...
my tribe is Shoshone-Bannock.

00:13:12.825 --> 00:13:15.360 line:0%
My mom is Shoshone,
my dad is Bannock.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.730
<i> We are one of the
 bigger tribes in Idaho</i>

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:20.098
<i> and we are all horse people
 there also.</i>

00:13:20.098 --> 00:13:23.902
<i> They are spiritual horses
 and they are kind to us and,</i>

00:13:23.902 --> 00:13:25.971
if we are kind to them,
they are kind to us.

00:13:25.971 --> 00:13:27.305
We thank the
creator of all life

00:13:27.305 --> 00:13:29.341
for bringing him,
the four-legged brother,

00:13:29.341 --> 00:13:31.076
he is a brother to us,

00:13:31.076 --> 00:13:33.478
so you can use him
in a good way.

00:13:33.478 --> 00:13:36.014
<i> We talk to horse, you know,
 they understand us.</i>

00:13:36.014 --> 00:13:38.383
They are smarter than
us humans, you know.

00:13:38.383 --> 00:13:40.285
Is it true,
because I've heard this

00:13:40.285 --> 00:13:42.354
a lot of times, but were you
really put on a horse

00:13:42.354 --> 00:13:44.523
before you could walk?
Would you say that's pretty--

00:13:44.523 --> 00:13:47.793
You know... yeah,
because my dad had,

00:13:47.793 --> 00:13:51.630
I've seen him put young kids on
and just lead them around

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:54.266
not give them the rein,
just lead them around,

00:13:54.266 --> 00:13:56.835
even there's cradle boards,
you know, on the side,

00:13:56.835 --> 00:13:59.738
my mom would ride and hang him
on the side of the horse

00:13:59.738 --> 00:14:02.507
and lead them that way,
and they were these babies,

00:14:02.507 --> 00:14:04.743
yeah,
and I still love them today

00:14:04.743 --> 00:14:07.680
and I can't wait to get back
home to ride 'em, you know,

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.748
It's the first time
in the city here.

00:14:09.748 --> 00:14:11.149
I'm not a city dude.

00:14:11.149 --> 00:14:13.785
( audience laughing )

00:14:13.785 --> 00:14:17.189
Talk to me about
working with horses,

00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:18.791
just working cattle
with horses,

00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:20.793
the daily life
you had growing up

00:14:20.793 --> 00:14:22.427
the economic way of life,

00:14:22.427 --> 00:14:24.095
<i> your family,
 what was that like?</i>

00:14:24.095 --> 00:14:25.630
<i> What did that mean for you?</i>

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:28.868
<i> You know,
 when my dad was growing up,</i>

00:14:28.868 --> 00:14:30.969
<i> he had lot of horses,
 he lived off the ranch,</i>

00:14:30.969 --> 00:14:32.404
<i> lived off the land,</i>

00:14:32.404 --> 00:14:35.374
<i> all of us guys did.
 My dad was my mentor.</i>

00:14:35.374 --> 00:14:37.909
<i> It's a lot easier now
 than back in the day,</i>

00:14:37.909 --> 00:14:39.444
<i> it was a lot rougher.</i>

00:14:39.444 --> 00:14:42.948
<i> So the meaning of hard work
 my dad taught me.</i>

00:14:42.948 --> 00:14:45.751
<i> You know, riding horses,
you know, it makes me feel good,</i>

00:14:45.751 --> 00:14:47.186
<i> growing up that way.</i>

00:14:48.687 --> 00:14:50.856
When I was out with you...

00:14:50.856 --> 00:14:53.124
I got to go when they were
rounding up some horses

00:14:53.124 --> 00:14:55.160
with him and
his brothers and

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.496
some other... other
family members

00:14:57.496 --> 00:14:59.764
and what I noticed, pictures
like this,

00:14:59.764 --> 00:15:01.267
<i> we are out with
 horses all day,</i>

00:15:01.267 --> 00:15:03.235
<i> and then everybody
 just sits around the fire</i>

00:15:03.235 --> 00:15:05.404
<i> and they start talking
 and people bring food</i>

00:15:05.404 --> 00:15:07.939
<i> and they start laughing
 and telling stories</i>

00:15:07.939 --> 00:15:10.342
<i> and that's what I find
 really special,</i>

00:15:10.342 --> 00:15:13.379
<i> is that the social aspect
 that surrounded this.</i>

00:15:13.379 --> 00:15:15.914
<i> This is the time
 when families got together,</i>

00:15:15.914 --> 00:15:17.215
<i> and that's what I saw
 with you.</i>

00:15:17.215 --> 00:15:18.783
<i> Tell me a little bit
 about that.</i>

00:15:18.783 --> 00:15:20.852
<i> It takes a while for the cows
 to get off the range.</i>

00:15:20.852 --> 00:15:23.155
<i> We just got to bringing them
 back off the range here</i>

00:15:23.155 --> 00:15:26.625
<i> and we had some coffee on that
 fire, we drink it up and...</i>

00:15:26.625 --> 00:15:28.360
And after that it was
a bunch of people,

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.596
we are just all a big family,
coming together

00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:32.664
laughing and joking and...

00:15:32.664 --> 00:15:35.367
but that was all part of
growing up, you know,

00:15:35.367 --> 00:15:39.270
getting together after
the big shindig, you know,

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:41.707
<i> like a buffalo hunt
 or deer hunt.</i>

00:15:41.707 --> 00:15:43.075
<i> Tell me about
 the buffalo hunt,</i>

00:15:43.075 --> 00:15:45.310
<i> what is means to you...</i>

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:47.045
<i> When we shot
 this buffalo here,</i>

00:15:47.045 --> 00:15:48.780
<i> we had a little ceremony,
 you know.</i>

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:51.917
<i> It is always good to have a
 little blessing for the animal</i>

00:15:51.917 --> 00:15:53.952
<i> when you take his life,</i>

00:15:53.952 --> 00:15:57.189
<i> that life is a life given.</i>

00:15:57.189 --> 00:15:59.591
That buffalo represents
strength, courage,

00:15:59.591 --> 00:16:04.796
longevity, long life,
and we use all parts of his...

00:16:04.796 --> 00:16:07.700
his hide, the skull,
the bones.

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.602
We don't leave nothing behind,
we take everything

00:16:10.602 --> 00:16:13.671
and when we skinned him,
we give him that ceremony and...

00:16:13.671 --> 00:16:16.975
his heart is still warm
when we gut him out

00:16:16.975 --> 00:16:18.910
and that's
when I gave you that,

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:22.514
the taste of the blood
through his heart.

00:16:22.514 --> 00:16:25.017
We got there and
after the hunt

00:16:25.017 --> 00:16:27.452
they cut the heart out
and we all drank the,

00:16:27.452 --> 00:16:30.989
the blood from the heart and..
why did we do that?

00:16:30.989 --> 00:16:34.025
Well, it's a ceremonial,
ceremonial thing.

00:16:34.025 --> 00:16:35.928
The buffalo represents
strength and courage

00:16:35.928 --> 00:16:38.730
and long life
and spirituality,

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:40.866
and by doing that,
you know, you are gonna

00:16:40.866 --> 00:16:43.334
live a long healthy life.

00:16:43.334 --> 00:16:47.105
Also, you told me that
the meat from this,

00:16:47.105 --> 00:16:48.773
when you did this hunt,
this was going to

00:16:48.773 --> 00:16:50.142
-the elders in the tribe?
-Yeah, that meat

00:16:50.142 --> 00:16:52.711
we took there...

00:16:52.711 --> 00:16:54.313
because they can't hunt
no more.

00:16:54.313 --> 00:16:57.148
We have to provide for them,
we just take care of them,

00:16:57.148 --> 00:16:58.550
because they took care of us,
and it is

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:01.153
our turn to take care
of the elders.

00:17:01.153 --> 00:17:04.088
<i> Leo does a lot, you know,
 he represents his tribe</i>

00:17:04.088 --> 00:17:06.825
<i> in a lot of parades.
 And you here,</i>

00:17:06.825 --> 00:17:08.526
<i> you told me you are wearing
 a war bonnet,</i>

00:17:08.526 --> 00:17:10.595
<i> you have, you said it's
 called a lance, correct?</i>

00:17:10.595 --> 00:17:12.330
<i> That's a lance I'm holding,
 yeah.</i>

00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:14.232
<i>And you also have the war bridle</i>

00:17:14.232 --> 00:17:15.434
<i> -tell me--
 -And the war bridle</i>

00:17:15.434 --> 00:17:18.236
<i> you got to be a pretty
 experienced rider to</i>

00:17:18.236 --> 00:17:21.940
<i> to have that...
 it's made out of raw hide.</i>

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:26.211
<i> It's like a the back of the
 sinew of the buffalo,</i>

00:17:26.211 --> 00:17:27.946
<i> that's what that is and</i>

00:17:27.946 --> 00:17:29.213
<i> how would you like to have</i>

00:17:29.213 --> 00:17:31.216
<i> the cold bridle in your mouth?
 You know,</i>

00:17:31.216 --> 00:17:33.051
and we had to run
a full circle,

00:17:33.051 --> 00:17:35.153
there's a whole arena
right here

00:17:35.153 --> 00:17:37.723
and we had to go
haul ass around

00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:40.492
that whole thing there,
haul butt,

00:17:40.492 --> 00:17:43.962
and he wanted to go
and I was holding him back,

00:17:43.962 --> 00:17:46.998
and one time I broke it,

00:17:46.998 --> 00:17:50.034
I broke that and I fixed it
real quick and go again,

00:17:50.034 --> 00:17:51.536
you know, so that war bridle...

00:17:51.536 --> 00:17:54.606
Like I said you gotta be
a pretty tricky rider to...

00:17:54.606 --> 00:17:57.742
experienced rider
to mess with one of those.

00:17:57.742 --> 00:17:59.877
You know,
that's back in the olden days,

00:17:59.877 --> 00:18:02.647
clear back in 1800s,
that's what they used

00:18:02.647 --> 00:18:04.282
when they went to war,

00:18:04.282 --> 00:18:07.786
or off to steal
another tribe's horses,

00:18:07.786 --> 00:18:09.988
you know,
that's what they did.

00:18:09.988 --> 00:18:11.890
<i> -And that's Indian Relay.
 -Indian...</i>

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:13.091
<i> You know.</i>

00:18:13.091 --> 00:18:16.728
<i> When I saw Indian Relay,
 it's just breathtaking.</i>

00:18:16.728 --> 00:18:19.164
<i> Now what I saw were people</i>

00:18:19.164 --> 00:18:21.266
<i> that were just
 extreme athletes</i>

00:18:21.266 --> 00:18:23.635
<i> and this picture for me
 sums up what I saw.</i>

00:18:23.635 --> 00:18:25.704
<i> They were
 flying with the horse</i>

00:18:25.704 --> 00:18:28.106
<i> and everything,
 everyone had told me...</i>

00:18:28.106 --> 00:18:30.508
<i> when we work with horses, we
 become one with horse as well.</i>

00:18:30.508 --> 00:18:32.444
<i> They showed me that,
 obviously.</i>

00:18:32.944 --> 00:18:34.245
Please tell me about
Indian Relay,

00:18:34.245 --> 00:18:36.515
tell me about
your relationship in it

00:18:36.515 --> 00:18:39.551
and what it means to kind of
pass this on to the youth?

00:18:39.551 --> 00:18:41.252
Okay, the Indian Relay...

00:18:41.252 --> 00:18:45.089
it started clear back
in early 1900s.

00:18:45.089 --> 00:18:47.391
<i> And what you see here
 is Fort Hall.</i>

00:18:47.391 --> 00:18:49.460
<i> And horses were coming out,</i>

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:51.696
<i> getting ready to run a race</i>

00:18:51.696 --> 00:18:56.635
<i> and there's three guys
 holding three horses.</i>

00:18:56.635 --> 00:19:00.205
<i> When they will come out,
 you'll see them.</i>

00:19:00.205 --> 00:19:02.274
<i> Pretty good music, huh?</i>

00:19:05.677 --> 00:19:09.548
<i> And that's the start
 of the race right here,</i>

00:19:09.548 --> 00:19:11.850
<i> and they'll go around and
 they'll exchange again.</i>

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:13.151
<i> I've done this
 for a lot of years</i>

00:19:13.151 --> 00:19:15.954
<i> and I kind of retired from it.</i>

00:19:15.954 --> 00:19:18.757
<i> And this is where they
 exchange horses right here,</i>

00:19:18.757 --> 00:19:20.759
<i> right in front of
 the grand stand.</i>

00:19:22.928 --> 00:19:26.531
<i> Now, next exchange
 and I was holding over here</i>

00:19:26.531 --> 00:19:28.300
<i> for one of my brothers.</i>

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:33.939
<i> I was a catcher.</i>

00:19:33.939 --> 00:19:35.173
<i> And you got to catch
 that horse</i>

00:19:35.173 --> 00:19:37.242
<i> so he can jump
 on to the next one.</i>

00:19:39.611 --> 00:19:41.980
<i> Gets pretty exciting here.</i>

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:44.449
<i> How fast are some of these
 horses coming in?</i>

00:19:44.449 --> 00:19:46.418
<i> The horses, they come in
 pretty quick like</i>

00:19:46.418 --> 00:19:48.286
<i> 25 miles an hour
 and you got to jump off</i>

00:19:48.286 --> 00:19:49.788
<i> to get on the next one.</i>

00:19:49.788 --> 00:19:52.123
<i> But once they pick up speed
 on last stretch</i>

00:19:52.123 --> 00:19:54.026
<i> it's like 35 miles an hour.</i>

00:19:55.526 --> 00:19:56.794
<i> And this is the last round.</i>

00:19:56.794 --> 00:19:58.964
<i> Once they finish
 the last round, they are,</i>

00:19:58.964 --> 00:20:01.233
<i> they are winners.</i>

00:20:02.434 --> 00:20:03.935
<i> So they are finishing
 the track</i>

00:20:03.935 --> 00:20:06.471
<i> right here to the finish line.</i>

00:20:06.471 --> 00:20:08.573
<i> And it is pretty well-known
 sport now.</i>

00:20:08.573 --> 00:20:10.875
<i> It goes all over the world.</i>

00:20:10.875 --> 00:20:12.477
<i> They are all over the place.</i>

00:20:15.113 --> 00:20:16.214
Tell me the history.

00:20:16.214 --> 00:20:18.049
Where did,
when did Indian Relay start?

00:20:18.049 --> 00:20:20.986
I've, I've heard that
it started in Fort Hall.

00:20:20.986 --> 00:20:24.155
Yeah that's, that's true,
you know, it has.

00:20:24.155 --> 00:20:25.390
It started right there
in Fort Hall,

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:27.992
that's where it originated,
this Indian Relay

00:20:27.992 --> 00:20:30.295
and it's gone over worldwide.

00:20:30.295 --> 00:20:33.664
It went viral, you know,
it's all over the place now.

00:20:33.664 --> 00:20:37.902
<i> You see these,
 and that's me right there.</i>

00:20:37.902 --> 00:20:42.007
<i> I'm 50-plus over now,
 I'm an old man.</i>

00:20:42.007 --> 00:20:43.174
<i> Tell me a little
 bit of the future.</i>

00:20:43.174 --> 00:20:44.409
<i> What's the future of horses?</i>

00:20:44.409 --> 00:20:46.711
<i> What do you see with you
 and your family</i>

00:20:46.711 --> 00:20:48.145
<i> and your grandkids?</i>

00:20:48.145 --> 00:20:51.449
<i> You know, I think right now,</i>

00:20:51.449 --> 00:20:53.018
<i> I got lot of grandkids
 growing up and</i>

00:20:53.018 --> 00:20:55.787
<i> I'm just going to help them
 to the best to my knowledge to</i>

00:20:55.787 --> 00:20:58.890
<i> get them involved in
 and working with horses,</i>

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:01.259
<i> and riding horses,
 just by watching them,</i>

00:21:01.259 --> 00:21:03.327
<i> taking them
 to the horse racing</i>

00:21:03.327 --> 00:21:05.897
<i> and maybe one day they will
 carry it on to their kids,</i>

00:21:05.897 --> 00:21:09.800
<i> you know and that's what
 makes me feel good.</i>

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.235
Erika Larsen:
<i> Thank you guys for coming.</i>

00:21:11.235 --> 00:21:14.640
( applause )

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:19.845
( outro music )
