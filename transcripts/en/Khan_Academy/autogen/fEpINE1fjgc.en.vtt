00:00:00.402 --> 00:00:02.198
 Rectangle ABCD is drawn 

00:00:02.198 --> 00:00:03.608
 in the coordinate plane. 

00:00:03.608 --> 00:00:05.811
 The edges of the rectangle are as follows, 

00:00:05.811 --> 00:00:08.086
 and the tokens are also given us. 

00:00:08.086 --> 00:00:09.549
 At these given coordinates, what is the length 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:12.359
 on the AD side of this rectangle? 

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:13.404
 So let's just put it on. 

00:00:13.404 --> 00:00:14.889
 This is one way to solve. 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:16.995
 Let's see, they're all in fact 

00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:17.865
 in the first quadrant, 

00:00:17.865 --> 00:00:20.444
 so I can focus on the first quadrant. 

00:00:20.444 --> 00:00:23.974
 Let's say this is the axis. 

00:00:23.974 --> 00:00:26.868
 This is the axis and let me also draw the x axis. 

00:00:28.038 --> 00:00:31.126
 Ax x and I really want to focus 

00:00:31.126 --> 00:00:32.566
 on points A and D, 

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:34.863
 because we have to find the length of the country alone 

00:00:34.863 --> 00:00:37.163
 from point A to point D. 

00:00:37.163 --> 00:00:39.925
 So, point A, let me do it with another color. 

00:00:39.925 --> 00:00:44.400
 Point A is equal to seven, 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.654
 y is equal to one. 

00:00:45.654 --> 00:00:50.274
 One two three four, 

00:00:50.274 --> 00:00:54.686
 five, six, seven, this is equal to seven. 

00:00:54.686 --> 00:00:56.985
 y is equal to one. 

00:00:56.985 --> 00:01:01.211
 y is equal to one, so here is point A. 

00:01:01.211 --> 00:01:04.810
 Point A, let me mark it. Point A. 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.643
 Then where is D? 

00:01:06.643 --> 00:01:11.643
 Point D has exactly the same x coordinate, 

00:01:11.643 --> 00:01:13.862
 but its y coordinate is slightly higher. 

00:01:13.862 --> 00:01:16.788
 Its y coordinate equals six. She is actually five higher. 

00:01:16.788 --> 00:01:20.097
 So point D is equal to seven, 

00:01:20.097 --> 00:01:22.721
 y is equal to six. 

00:01:22.721 --> 00:01:26.993
 So, y is equal to one, two, three, 

00:01:26.993 --> 00:01:30.453
 four, five, and six. 

00:01:30.453 --> 00:01:32.661
 That is, y is equal to six 

00:01:32.661 --> 00:01:34.704
 and so we can draw the point. 

00:01:34.704 --> 00:01:37.096
 It will be right here. 

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:39.093
 This is point D 

00:01:39.093 --> 00:01:41.600
 and in fact we could link them to a stretch if we want, 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.364
 to show that this is a rectangle. 

00:01:44.364 --> 00:01:47.823
 Let me draw it. I can just draw it this way. 

00:01:47.823 --> 00:01:48.868
 And we already have it. 

00:01:48.868 --> 00:01:50.540
 Even the whole rectangle has not yet been drawn, 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.212
 I just brought these two points, 

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:55.857
 and we can think about what length AD is. 

00:01:55.857 --> 00:01:59.131
 We can say that x does not change, going from A to D, 

00:01:59.131 --> 00:02:02.405
 but we increase in the direction of five. 

00:02:02.405 --> 00:02:06.863
 We go from y equal to one, to y equal to five, 

00:02:06.863 --> 00:02:08.604
 to y is equal to six. 

00:02:08.604 --> 00:02:11.739
 So the change in t is equal to five. 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:13.596
 So what is the length of this stretch? 

00:02:13.596 --> 00:02:14.641
 Well she will be five. 

00:02:14.641 --> 00:02:17.567
 It will be five, no matter what the units are. 

00:02:17.567 --> 00:02:19.471
 This is the length of side AD. 

00:02:19.471 --> 00:02:21.212
 She will be equal to five. 

00:02:21.212 --> 00:02:24.881
 We went from the point (7; 1) 

00:02:24.881 --> 00:02:28.990
 to the point (7; 6). 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.709
 It is said to us that this is a rectangle. 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:31.707
 And just for our satisfaction 

00:02:31.707 --> 00:02:33.878
 we can draw the entire rectangle. 

00:02:33.878 --> 00:02:37.347
 We have this point B, which is equal to five, 

00:02:37.347 --> 00:02:39.706
 equal to one, so let me draw it. 

00:02:39.706 --> 00:02:41.888
 I am doing this now only for pleasure. 

00:02:41.888 --> 00:02:44.001
 We're ready for the task. 

00:02:44.001 --> 00:02:47.530
 So, equal to five, equal to one. That's right here. 

00:02:50.526 --> 00:02:51.942
 This is point B. 

00:02:51.942 --> 00:02:55.611
 Let me write Q. This is the point (5; 1). 

00:02:55.611 --> 00:02:58.490
 And then we have the point C. I'll do it in another color. 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.462
 Point C is equal to five, equal to six. 

00:03:01.462 --> 00:03:04.643
 x equal to five, equal to six. 

00:03:04.643 --> 00:03:07.452
 Point C is right here. 

00:03:07.452 --> 00:03:11.957
 Point C is the point x equal to five equal to six. 

00:03:11.957 --> 00:03:14.325
 And then we can tie all the points if we want, 

00:03:14.325 --> 00:03:16.994
 and clearly see that this is a rectangle. 

00:03:16.994 --> 00:03:18.760
 I can connect these. 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.082
 I can connect these two. 

00:03:21.082 --> 00:03:22.754
 Then I can connect these two. 

00:03:22.754 --> 00:03:24.797
 And then we see that we really have a rectangle. 

00:03:24.797 --> 00:03:26.840
 But we've already answered that length a little bit ago 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.510
 on side AD is equal to five. 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.880
 If we were interested in other countries, 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.458
 the length of BA, but that's two. 

00:03:33.458 --> 00:03:36.755
 a difference of two along the x direction, 

00:03:36.755 --> 00:03:37.776
 the horizontal direction, 

00:03:37.776 --> 00:03:39.796
 a difference of two along the x direction, 

00:03:39.796 --> 00:03:42.397
 a difference of five in the direction t. 

00:03:42.397 --> 00:03:45.269
 We go from equals to one to six. 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:45.983
 So we got it. 

00:03:45.983 --> 00:03:47.905
 We actually found all the countries 

00:03:47.905 --> 00:03:49.274
 of this rectangle.
