00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:07.430
Now, you’ve heard of blacks holes, but what
about 5 dimensional black holes?!

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:14.870
Now, we experience the world in 3 dimensions
plus time - that makes 4.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.490
To prove the existence of any other dimensions
we would have to use high powered experiments

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.090
like the Large Hadron Collider or theoretical
physics.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.982
For instance, string theory, which suggests
that the most elementary particles in the

00:00:26.982 --> 00:00:29.980
universe are tiny vibrating strings.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.490
This theory proposes that the universe could
be made up of as many as 11 dimensions.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:35.840
Weird, right?

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.300
Now for theoretical physicists this opened
up a world of possibilities.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.850
For instance, back in 2002, physicists theorized
that if the universe did have 5 dimensions,

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.080
-- a crazy kind of 5D black hole, called a
black ring, could exist.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.080
However, it wasn’t until recently that they
were able to model what these would look like.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.630
It was scientists from UNiversity of Cambridge
and Queen Mary University of London who used

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.090
the COSMOS supercomputer to run a simulation
on black rings.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.360
The results published in the journal Physical
Review Letters found that a black ring is

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.980
highly unstable.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.300
And that its structure can pull apart, kind
of like silly putty.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.560
The researchers found that a black ring could
in fact, be stretched out so thinly, that

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.900
it could produce smaller mini-black holes
that were pinched off from the main ring.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.840
Now as the ring breaks apart it becomes what’s
called a “naked singularity”, which is

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.320
where things gets weird.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.670
Now a singularity is located right in the
center of a black hole and it’s where the

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.170
gravitational field is most dense.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.990
But since nothing, not even light can escape
a black hole, we can’t see these singularities.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.300
But a black ring in a 5 dimensional universe
with a naked singularity would be very different.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.120
Naked singularities are so named, because
they are no longer hidden within the boundaries

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.300
of a black hole or the event horizon.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.210
Remember, these singularities are formed as
a black ring is breaking apart to form new

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.210
black holes.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.560
Basically, what this all means is that we
could potentially see them!* And unlike a

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.610
4D singularity, you might even be able to
GO INSIDE OF A NAKED SINGULARITY AND COME

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.860
OUT ALIVE.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.800
Simply put, all this turns Einstein’s theory
of relativity on it’s head.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.590
That’s because all of Einstein’s equations
to predict the future of our universe and

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.310
how it works are all based on the idea that
it exists in 4 dimensions.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.790
If we can prove that black rings exist it
means that his theory, isn’t wrong but could

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.320
be incomplete.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.640
This means that researchers would have to
find a whole new theory to explain the universe.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.940
But like I said, this is only a computer model,
for now it’s like scientists are just having

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.290
fun seeing how far they can stretch physics
on a computer.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.730

The physics of black holes is strange and
weird.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.780
I mean nothing can escape them!

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.209
How is that even possible, can nothing really
escape a black hole?

00:02:50.209 --> 00:03:17.180
Well Julian has the answer, right here.
