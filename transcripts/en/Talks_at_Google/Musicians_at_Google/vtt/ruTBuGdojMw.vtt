00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.567
&gt;&gt;presenter: Hello, everyone.

00:00:01.567 --> 00:00:02.833
&gt;&gt;audience: Hello!

00:00:02.833 --> 00:00:05.167
&gt;&gt;presenter: Thank you
very much for coming today.

00:00:05.167 --> 00:00:06.633
This is actually the
first time I've

00:00:06.633 --> 00:00:10.333
hosted a Musicians@Google
event, so bear with me.

00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:14.533
I'm a little bit nervous, but
I could not be happier to

00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:17.167
have the honor of
introducing today's guest.

00:00:17.167 --> 00:00:20.000
We're incredibly fortunate to
have him with us today for

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.367
an acoustic performance and
he'll be sticking around

00:00:22.367 --> 00:00:24.400
for a bit to answer
your questions after,

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.800
after the show.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.033
So, you can submit questions
or you can vote on questions

00:00:29.033 --> 00:00:32.500
at go/askfranti, alright?

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.333
Michael has been well known to
area music fans for well over

00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:37.633
20 years and has earned a
truly international following

00:00:37.633 --> 00:00:38.633
during that time.

00:00:38.633 --> 00:00:41.267
He's built a reputation for
tremendously energetic and

00:00:41.267 --> 00:00:43.767
positive performances that
often combine sharp social

00:00:43.767 --> 00:00:46.733
commentary with a fusion
of countless musical styles

00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:49.600
including, but absolutely
not limited to reggae,

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.267
hip-hop, rock, folk, jazz,
and if you listen closely,

00:00:54.267 --> 00:00:56.633
even a few metal
riffs here and there.

00:00:56.633 --> 00:00:59.167
Michael and his band, Spearhead,
are perhaps best known

00:00:59.167 --> 00:01:02.267
to San Franciscans and Bay
Area natives in general,

00:01:02.267 --> 00:01:03.733
for their Power to the
Peaceful Festival,

00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:05.467
which is a free event
that draws tens of

00:01:05.467 --> 00:01:08.300
thousands to Golden Gate Park
each year for two magical days

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.700
in music, and
social awareness.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.367
They've been a fixture
on the national fe-,

00:01:12.367 --> 00:01:14.967
festival scene as well,
with appearances at Bonnaroo,

00:01:14.967 --> 00:01:17.533
Coachella, the Taos
Solar Music Festival

00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:20.367
and the New Orleans Jazz
Fest, just to name a few.

00:01:20.367 --> 00:01:22.967
Michael and Spearhead are
currently touring in support

00:01:22.967 --> 00:01:25.333
of their forthcoming
album, The Sound of Sunshine,

00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:27.233
which will be released
on August 24th

00:01:27.233 --> 00:01:28.633
and he'll be appearing
here in the Bay Area

00:01:28.633 --> 00:01:32.233
at the Greek Theatre in
Berkeley on July 16th.

00:01:32.233 --> 00:01:34.767
So, on behalf of
mu-, Musicians@Google,

00:01:34.767 --> 00:01:36.067
it is my great pleasure to

00:01:36.067 --> 00:01:38.333
welcome Mr. Michael
Franti to the stage.

00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:52.800
[applause and clapping]
[whistle]

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.667
&gt;&gt;Franti: Thanks so much
for having us here today

00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:58.433
and I brought my buddy, Jay,
with me to play guitar.

00:01:58.433 --> 00:02:03.333
Jolene here to sing with us and
my son is here, Ade, and--

00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:06.267
[clapping] 
[guitar strumming]

00:02:06.267 --> 00:02:09.200
it's a big part of his summer
vacation to be out here.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.433
[guitar strumming] 
And I'll play a couple songs.

00:02:14.433 --> 00:02:17.433
Then I guess we'll do some,
some questioning and answering.

00:02:17.433 --> 00:02:21.967
But I've always thought that
it would be really cool to

00:02:21.967 --> 00:02:27.300
do shows where instead of the
people asking the performers,

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.633
[uses deep voice] "Would
you please turn off

00:02:28.633 --> 00:02:31.467
your cell phone or devices?"

00:02:31.467 --> 00:02:33.567
That it would be the
opposite; that at our shows

00:02:33.567 --> 00:02:35.733
people would go there and
they'd turn on their phones

00:02:35.733 --> 00:02:38.467
and they'd use their phone
interactively during the show,

00:02:38.467 --> 00:02:43.000
so please feel free to type
away [laughs] at your computer

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.833
or take pictures or film or
blog or vlog or if you wanna

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:49.733
come up here and sing and
film it while we're doin' it--

00:02:49.733 --> 00:02:50.967
[audience laughs] 
or do a dance behind us,

00:02:50.967 --> 00:02:56.567
or like, [strums guitar]
anyway, here we go.

00:02:56.567 --> 00:02:59.167
One, two, three, come on.

00:02:59.167 --> 00:03:14.667
[upbeat guitar music]

00:03:14.667 --> 00:03:17.767
Put your hand together, ya'll.

00:03:17.767 --> 00:03:20.067
"I wake up in the
morning its six o'clock

00:03:20.067 --> 00:03:22.467
They say there may be
rain but the sun is hot

00:03:22.467 --> 00:03:24.667
I wish I had some time
just to kill today

00:03:24.667 --> 00:03:27.400
And I wish I had a dime for
every bill I got to pay

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.300
Some days you lose you win

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.833
And the water's as high
as the times you're in

00:03:31.833 --> 00:03:34.100
So I just back in where
I learned to swim

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.433
Try to keep my head
above it the best I can

00:03:36.433 --> 00:03:45.600
That's why, here I am, waitin'
for this storm to pass me by

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:54.800
That's the sound of
sunshine comin' down

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:03.933
That's the sound of
sunshine comin' down

00:04:03.933 --> 00:04:11.833
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay"

00:04:11.833 --> 00:04:13.933
One, two, put your
hands together now

00:04:13.933 --> 00:04:16.500
"I saw my friend Bobby.
He said 'what's up man.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.567
You got a little work or 20
to lend' I opened up my hand

00:04:19.567 --> 00:04:22.133
he said 'I'm glad to see
They can take away my job

00:04:22.133 --> 00:04:23.000
but not my friends.'

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:32.533
You see and here I am, waitin'
for this storm to pass me by

00:04:32.533 --> 00:04:41.867
That's the sound of
sunshine comin' down

00:04:41.867 --> 00:04:48.433
That's the sound of
sunshine comin' down"

00:04:48.433 --> 00:04:51.567
Google, tell me how
you feelin' y'all

00:04:51.567 --> 00:04:53.300
"I wanna go where the
summer never ends

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.800
With my guitar on the beach
there with all my friends

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.000
The sun's so hot and
the wave's in motion

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.400
And everything smells
like suntan lotion

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.733
The ocean and the
girls so sweet

00:05:02.733 --> 00:05:05.133
So kick off your shoes
and relax your feet

00:05:05.133 --> 00:05:07.700
They say that miracles
are never ceasin'

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.900
Every single soul needs
a little releasin'

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.867
Stereo bumpin' till
the sun goes down

00:05:11.867 --> 00:05:14.067
And I only wanna
hear that sound

00:05:14.067 --> 00:05:22.300
That's the sound of
sunshine comin' down

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:30.267
Yeah, that's the sound
of sunshine comin' down"

00:05:30.267 --> 00:05:32.300
Boogie rock that guitar

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:57.700
[guitar solo]

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.333
Give it up for Jake Boogie
on the guitar, ya'll

00:06:00.333 --> 00:06:04.967
"You're the one I wanna be with
When the sun goes down

00:06:04.967 --> 00:06:09.533
You're the one I wanna be with
When the sun goes down

00:06:09.533 --> 00:06:14.300
You're the one I wanna be with
When the sun goes down

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.433
You're the one I wanna be with
When the sun goes

00:06:18.433 --> 00:06:26.633
That's the sound of
sunshine comin' down"

00:06:26.633 --> 00:06:27.633
There you go

00:06:27.633 --> 00:06:36.600

Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay
Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay"

00:06:52.467 --> 00:06:57.833
I wanna hear ya'll sing it now
"That's the sound of

00:06:57.833 --> 00:07:04.333
[mouths the words] sunshine
comin' down"

00:07:04.333 --> 00:07:06.333
[applause] 
A little louder.

00:07:06.333 --> 00:07:07.267
[sings] "That's

00:07:07.267 --> 00:07:13.700

00:07:19.633 --> 00:07:22.033
The Google Tabernacle Choir

00:07:22.033 --> 00:07:23.233
in attendance.

00:07:23.233 --> 00:07:24.567
[laughter and applause] 
All right.

00:07:24.567 --> 00:07:34.100
[more upbeat guitar music]

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:38.900
"Oh you're perfect just the way
you are, just the way you are

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:43.233
Oh you're perfect just the way
you are, just the way you are

00:07:43.233 --> 00:07:45.400
Shake it, shake it,

Shake it, shake it mama,

I'm realizin you the only
one that's meant to be

And when I wake up in the
mornin' all I wanna see

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.000
Is the sun that is shinin
on you next to me

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.700
You got a little broken nail,
got a hair outta place

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.967
A little bit of extra middle
right around the waist

00:08:05.967 --> 00:08:08.133
With all of them things
I never ever hesitate

00:08:08.133 --> 00:08:10.433
'Cause the thing about you baby
is the smile on your face

00:08:10.433 --> 00:08:12.700
Blowin' kisses at you girl,
I hope they didn't miss

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:15.200
The way you move your body made
it hard for them to hit you

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.833
I wish you would come
a little closer

00:08:17.833 --> 00:08:19.700
Rub a little closer mama
See it mama closer

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.100
So shake it, shake it,

Shake it, shake it, shake it"
How you feelin', ya'll?

00:08:38.067 --> 00:08:40.400
"I got love for you baby,

I love the way you love me,

I love the way you shake that
little extra bit of butta

When I see you move your body,
girl it makes my heart a flutta

00:08:47.267 --> 00:08:49.933
When I see you dance upon
the living room floor,

00:08:49.933 --> 00:08:51.833
on the kitchen table
Better open up the door

00:08:51.833 --> 00:08:52.833
Bring the party to the street

00:08:52.833 --> 00:08:54.267
because the street
will love her more

00:08:54.267 --> 00:08:56.433
The people love the beat, and
the beat will love her more

00:08:56.433 --> 00:08:58.667
With the music blastin,
the people clappin,

00:08:58.667 --> 00:09:01.100
the speakers shakin,
the kids will take it

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.200
You're perfect, just

Oh, just the way you are."

00:09:40.267 --> 00:09:46.233
[guitar strumming] We need some
volunteers from the audience.

00:09:46.233 --> 00:09:47.667
All right, come

All right, we got a
lot of volunteers here.

00:10:11.433 --> 00:10:15.733
Ok, we're gonna have

00:10:19.733 --> 00:10:20.867
Put your hands together.

You the one for me now.

Give it up for Eric, ya'll.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:03.700
Ok, we gotta make this a
little more difficult.

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.300

This is Heather.
Give it up for Heather.

species at a NASCAR event.

00:11:25.433 --> 00:11:28.933
The California
condor at a NASCAR event.

00:11:28.933 --> 00:11:31.200
[laughter] NASCAR
is auto racing.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.767
Ok, ready?
Here we go.

&gt;&gt;Franti: She said be nice.

00:12:34.267 --> 00:12:37.333
Ok, anybody have a,

&gt;&gt;Franti: The Macarena!

00:12:46.067 --> 00:12:49.500

00:12:57.667 --> 00:13:08.000

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.400
Obviously, she's been
taking lessons at the,

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:18.767
at the Google "How to be Cool
at a Party Dance Class, right?

00:13:18.767 --> 00:13:20.567
All right.

00:13:20.567 --> 00:13:22.200

[applause] Awesome, David.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:22.500
[pause] 
Ok.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:27.933
[pause] That was a
nice little warm up.

00:14:27.933 --> 00:14:30.933
I like that dude back there.
He's got a lot of energy.

00:14:30.933 --> 00:14:32.300
What department are you in?

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:33.767

00:14:33.767 --> 00:14:35.700
&gt;&gt;Franti: Aaah!
No wonder.

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.767
Hahaha.

00:14:37.767 --> 00:14:42.767
Ok, questions, right?
Is that what we're doin' now?

00:14:42.767 --> 00:14:46.733
Yeah, I think so.
Yeah, I'd love some water.

00:14:46.733 --> 00:14:49.467
[pause] Does
anybody have a question?

00:14:49.467 --> 00:14:51.100
&gt;&gt;memberfemale3: Will
you please sing more?

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:52.100
&gt;&gt;Franti: What's that?

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:52.933
&gt;&gt;memberfemale3: Will
you please sing more?

00:14:52.933 --> 00:14:55.233
[laughter] &gt;&gt;Franti: Oh,
yeah we'll sing more, yeah?

00:14:55.233 --> 00:14:56.800
Are we supposed
to do questions?

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.567
Is that this works?
Oh, we mix it up.

00:14:59.567 --> 00:15:01.433
Ok, we'll take a question.
Anybody have a question?

00:15:01.433 --> 00:15:02.000
Ok.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.867
&gt;&gt;member4: What's it
like opening for Mayer?

00:15:03.867 --> 00:15:06.100
&gt;&gt;Franti: What is it
like opening for Mayer?

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:09.333
[pause] Mayor
McCheese or John Mayer?

00:15:09.333 --> 00:15:14.167
[laughter] 
Oh. John Mayer.

00:15:14.167 --> 00:15:16.000
It was really a
unique experience

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.533
because right when
we started the tour,

00:15:18.533 --> 00:15:21.133
he had this big
article come out in,

00:15:21.133 --> 00:15:24.833
I guess, Playboy magazine,
which I never read, of course.

00:15:24.833 --> 00:15:29.867
[laughter] And, you know, he
said all these flammatory,

00:15:29.867 --> 00:15:36.533
inflammatory things, very, you
know, weird stuff, you know?

00:15:36.533 --> 00:15:43.067
Sexual and racial things and
so I immediately went to him

00:15:43.067 --> 00:15:45.467
and talked to him about
it and at the time

00:15:45.467 --> 00:15:48.167
he was super remorseful,
you know what I mean?

00:15:48.167 --> 00:15:51.000
He was just like, he said, "This
is the worst day of my life.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.400
I don't know how it
could get any worse."

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.067
And so we talked
for a long time.

00:15:54.067 --> 00:15:56.400
We actually became really
good friends around it,

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:57.067
you know?

00:15:57.067 --> 00:16:00.200
And my music has
always been the opposite,

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:00.567
you know?

00:16:00.567 --> 00:16:04.267
To try to bring people,
different groups together

00:16:04.267 --> 00:16:08.167
and he, his music is that, too.

00:16:08.167 --> 00:16:11.333
But, sometimes his mouth
runs in a different way.

00:16:11.333 --> 00:16:14.667
[laughter] And so, we
just talked a lot about

00:16:14.667 --> 00:16:17.467
getting your heart
and your mouth to

00:16:17.467 --> 00:16:20.233
say what you mean and mean
what you say, you know?

00:16:20.233 --> 00:16:23.367
And so we had a really great
time and it was really cool

00:16:23.367 --> 00:16:24.900
cause we recorded
this new album,

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:27.567
"Sound of Sunshine," in
the dressing room of

00:16:27.567 --> 00:16:31.433
all these locker rooms of
the NBA and hockey teams

00:16:31.433 --> 00:16:33.100
that we were playing in.

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:37.033
And so, you know, we'd go out
on stage and we'd play a song

00:16:37.033 --> 00:16:39.567
to 15,000 people who had
never heard our music before

00:16:39.567 --> 00:16:43.733
and then we'd go in the locker
room afterwards and we'd say,

00:16:43.733 --> 00:16:46.000
"You know, we played that
one too fast or too slow."

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.667
And then we were
able to just like,

00:16:47.667 --> 00:16:49.767
on our laptop,
re-record the song.

00:16:49.767 --> 00:16:52.067
We'd set the drums up
in the shower and

00:16:52.067 --> 00:16:55.200
I'd sing in the shower, which
is the best place to sing,

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:59.200
of course, and, and we made
this whole album on tour.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.600
And so it was really great
to have that kind of like,

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.333
interactive capability
to be able to see

00:17:05.333 --> 00:17:08.033
what the audience wants
or is responding to,

00:17:08.033 --> 00:17:08.900
and then be able to go in

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:10.567
and just make
immediate changes.

00:17:10.567 --> 00:17:14.067
And it used to be, they used
to make an album for months

00:17:14.067 --> 00:17:16.067
or spend a year doing it
and then you get on the road

00:17:16.067 --> 00:17:18.733
and you'd realize like, "God,
this song was too slow."

00:17:18.733 --> 00:17:22.733
And, and so it was a
great experience for us to,

00:17:22.733 --> 00:17:25.133
to be able to have
that huge audience

00:17:25.133 --> 00:17:27.600
to see how people
respond, so yeah.

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.767
And in the end, me and
John became great buddies

00:17:30.767 --> 00:17:32.767
and we had a fun time.

00:17:32.767 --> 00:17:35.100
Yeah, thank you, man.
Thanks.

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:36.600
&gt;&gt;presenter: So, so we
have the Q&amp;A mic here.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.433
I thought I'd,
I'd cue things up.

00:17:38.433 --> 00:17:40.300
Tell me more about
your, your YouTube story.

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:41.467
You were one of
the first artists

00:17:41.467 --> 00:17:43.067
to really use that medium.

00:17:43.067 --> 00:17:44.100
How did you get started

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.067
and what's it doin'
for you right now?

00:17:46.067 --> 00:17:48.100
&gt;&gt;Franti: Well, I got started
through my son, Ade.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:49.800
[audience member says Woo!]
[mild clapping]

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:53.967
Who was like, yeah, who really
got me excited about YouTube,

00:17:53.967 --> 00:17:54.300
you know?

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.067
We'd stay up at
night and we'd be like,

00:17:56.067 --> 00:17:57.167
"Ok, David Blaine."

00:17:57.167 --> 00:18:00.733
[laughter] I mean, like,
YouTube David Blaine

00:18:00.733 --> 00:18:01.967
for six hours, you know?

00:18:01.967 --> 00:18:05.200
And then it would be like,
the best soccer goals of 2004,

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:08.767
you know, and-- [laughter]
and I'm still that way.

00:18:08.767 --> 00:18:11.233
I don't have TV
per se in my house,

00:18:11.233 --> 00:18:15.700
but I have YouTube and
I have Google and so,

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:19.533
we just, that's our way
of entertaining ourselves.

00:18:19.533 --> 00:18:23.867
But I thought, "Wouldn't it be
cool to give people a little

00:18:23.867 --> 00:18:25.867
glimpse of what we do
every day on tour."

00:18:25.867 --> 00:18:28.733
Because I remember just
lookin' at album covers

00:18:28.733 --> 00:18:32.167
when I was a kid and I'd see
like, a photo of The Clash

00:18:32.167 --> 00:18:33.667
on this album and
I'd think like,

00:18:33.667 --> 00:18:35.900
"Man, where did that
dude get his belt?"

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:38.033
Or where, where
did they, you know,

00:18:38.033 --> 00:18:40.833
how does he string his
guitar backwards like that

00:18:40.833 --> 00:18:42.933
or something and,
and so I thought,

00:18:42.933 --> 00:18:45.633
"Wouldn't it be cool if like,
next time I went belt shopping

00:18:45.633 --> 00:18:48.133
I just brought my
little camera with me

00:18:48.133 --> 00:18:49.067
and we could show that."

00:18:49.067 --> 00:18:51.100
So, we created this thing
called, "Fran TV,"

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:55.233
and every day we just do like
a two or three minute vlog

00:18:55.233 --> 00:18:57.433
about our life on tour.

00:18:57.433 --> 00:18:59.633
And sometimes
it's as, you know,

00:18:59.633 --> 00:19:01.733
mundane as belt shopping
and other times

00:19:01.733 --> 00:19:04.967
we're interviewing somebody
who is doing some really

00:19:04.967 --> 00:19:08.133
creative grass roots
political organizing

00:19:08.133 --> 00:19:11.767
or somebody who has got
a fantastic new record

00:19:11.767 --> 00:19:15.700
or, that no one has ever heard
of and we interview them

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:18.100
or us just playing out on
the street somewhere.

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:21.733
So, we love YouTube.

00:19:21.733 --> 00:19:23.567
&gt;&gt;membermale5: You just
mentioned some of the ways

00:19:23.567 --> 00:19:26.467
that technology, including
technology created by Google,

00:19:26.467 --> 00:19:29.867
is helping connect you to
the, the world of individuals.

00:19:29.867 --> 00:19:32.833
What are some of the negative
sides of big companies

00:19:32.833 --> 00:19:36.567
like Google, and what can
we do to mitigate those?

00:19:36.567 --> 00:19:43.867
&gt;&gt;Franti: Hmmmm.
Negative things.

00:19:43.867 --> 00:19:49.033
You know, I-, I'll,
I'll kinda say it in,

00:19:49.033 --> 00:19:51.400
what, what people, what
some artists view

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:54.133
as a negative is obviously
downloading, you know?

00:19:54.133 --> 00:19:57.067
And it's really
changed the music business,

00:19:57.067 --> 00:19:58.500
the way that we do it.

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:04.233
I was one of the artists who
never really sold lots of

00:20:04.233 --> 00:20:07.067
records, so when our music
started get downloaded

00:20:07.067 --> 00:20:11.233
and traded, it, like
our career mushroomed.

00:20:11.233 --> 00:20:15.100
It was the opposite and we
always made music for people

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:18.833
to enjoy and we hoped that
they would come to our shows

00:20:18.833 --> 00:20:20.500
and then that they
would buy a t-shirt,

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:23.167
or that they would support us
by coming to 2, 3 or 4 shows.

00:20:23.167 --> 00:20:27.367
And that's the way our
fan base grew and so,

00:20:27.367 --> 00:20:29.600
we've always been
a band that said,

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:32.633
"Let's just ride with
the wave of technology;

00:20:32.633 --> 00:20:34.067
whatever is coming out.

00:20:34.067 --> 00:20:37.600
Let's use it to help spread
the word about what we do."

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:41.133
And we believe that if you
treat the fans with dignity

00:20:41.133 --> 00:20:46.200
and love and connection, and
if they have a request that

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.167
you try your
best to fulfill it,

00:20:48.167 --> 00:20:50.233
that they always come back.

00:20:50.233 --> 00:20:54.233
And, and so, I don't really see
that there's anything wrong.

00:20:54.233 --> 00:20:56.500
I can't think of
anything particularly

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:58.467
with Google that's wrong.

00:20:58.467 --> 00:21:02.733
But just, you know, there's,
there's so many changes

00:21:02.733 --> 00:21:05.533
that are, that are happening
as we speak in terms of

00:21:05.533 --> 00:21:09.067
what music is delivered to
people and we're just a band

00:21:09.067 --> 00:21:11.433
that feels like rather
than try to fight it

00:21:11.433 --> 00:21:12.867
with lawyers and Congress

00:21:12.867 --> 00:21:15.700
and all this kind of stuff,
that we just go with it

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:19.233
and see how we can change what
we do and get our head wrapped

00:21:19.233 --> 00:21:22.000
around it in a different way
in a new way to help our fans

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:29.567
have the music because that's
the most important thing.

00:21:29.567 --> 00:21:32.233
[pause] &gt;&gt;membermale6: If
Meg Whitman is elected

00:21:32.233 --> 00:21:35.767
in November, who do you
think should do the next

00:21:35.767 --> 00:21:37.467
California Uber Alles?

00:21:37.467 --> 00:21:39.967
&gt;&gt;Franti: Oh, wow,
probably Woody Harrelson.

00:21:39.967 --> 00:21:44.633
[laughter] Because, California
Uber Alles is this Dead

00:21:44.633 --> 00:21:47.400
Kennedy's song that was about
the governor of California

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.133
back when, I think he wrote it
when Reagan was the governor

00:21:50.133 --> 00:21:53.033
and then I did a version
when Pete Wilson was governor.

00:21:53.033 --> 00:21:59.733
But, yeah, you know, I think
Woody would be a great person

00:21:59.733 --> 00:22:01.433
because he's got a
great sense of humor

00:22:01.433 --> 00:22:03.400
and he also smokes
loads of weed and--

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.333
[laughter] she's kind of;

00:22:04.333 --> 00:22:07.300
she's kind of contrary to
either of those things.

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:10.167
[Franti laughs] So,
he'd be a good person.

00:22:10.167 --> 00:22:21.500
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jolene: [inaudible]

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.200
&gt;&gt;Franti: Oh, sorry.
There's a monitor there.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.433
[reads from monitor]
"What project, music

00:22:25.433 --> 00:22:28.233
or otherwise, had the
biggest personal impact?

00:22:28.233 --> 00:22:32.033
Which one has had the
most public impact?"

00:22:32.033 --> 00:22:34.667
I presume they
mean of my work.

00:22:34.667 --> 00:22:36.133
What project,
music or otherwise,

00:22:36.133 --> 00:22:41.033
has had the
biggest personal impact?

00:22:41.033 --> 00:22:44.433
[woman clears throat] Well,
my music always comes from

00:22:44.433 --> 00:22:48.467
personal experience, but a
few years ago I took a trip to

00:22:48.467 --> 00:22:51.100
Iraq and I played music
on the street and I was,

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:55.100
I kept watching the nightly news
and I kept watching YouTube.

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:57.233
And the things that I was
seeing on the nightly news

00:22:57.233 --> 00:23:00.100
were completely the opposite of
what I was seeing on YouTube

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:02.767
in terms of what was happening
on the ground in Iraq.

00:23:02.767 --> 00:23:05.700
And so I said to myself, "I'd
really like to go to Iraq

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:06.867
and see what's happened."

00:23:06.867 --> 00:23:09.533
So, I took my guitar and
a video camera and 6 fr-,

00:23:09.533 --> 00:23:12.467
and 6 friends and we
flew to Amman, Jordan.

00:23:12.467 --> 00:23:16.633
We hopped in a 16 passenger
plane and we flew to Bagdad

00:23:16.633 --> 00:23:19.533
and we get over the
airport in Bagdad

00:23:19.533 --> 00:23:23.767
and the pilot says, "In order
to avoid a hit from a SAM-7

00:23:23.767 --> 00:23:27.667
surface to air shoulder-launched
missile, or small arms fire

00:23:27.667 --> 00:23:31.433
from the ground, we will enter
into a spiral descent."

00:23:31.433 --> 00:23:36.300
[laughter] I was like, "I
don't know what all that

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:38.833
first stuff meant, but I
know what a spiral is."

00:23:38.833 --> 00:23:42.833
[laughs] And sure enough,
we go into this descent

00:23:42.833 --> 00:23:44.800
just spiraling straight
down to the ground

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.467
so he can get down there
as fast as possible

00:23:46.467 --> 00:23:50.533
and a heat-seeking missile can
only make one arc, I found out.

00:23:50.533 --> 00:23:53.933
So, if you keep
spinning, it can't hit you.

00:23:53.933 --> 00:23:56.367
So I get on the ground
and I played music there

00:23:56.367 --> 00:23:58.900
and I had all these songs
prepared that were, like,

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:01.767
you know, peace songs and
kind of protest songs

00:24:01.767 --> 00:24:04.200
that I had written over the
years and I was gonna sing them

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.267
for people on the ground.

00:24:05.267 --> 00:24:08.567
And when I got there,
I found that people,

00:24:08.567 --> 00:24:11.967
Iraqis, were like, "That's
a really nice sentiment,

00:24:11.967 --> 00:24:15.433
but play us something
that makes us dance.

00:24:15.433 --> 00:24:17.067
Play us something
that makes us laugh.

00:24:17.067 --> 00:24:18.900
Play us something
that makes us smile,

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:21.000
or cry, or feel something."

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.600
And, and so it really changed
the way that I thought about

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:27.700
music cause the whole first
part of my career in music,

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:30.500
I wrote lots of really
heavy, political songs

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:35.433
and then I realized that if
I wanted to reach people

00:24:35.433 --> 00:24:39.767
all over the place, i-, it's
like, you can either teach him,

00:24:39.767 --> 00:24:42.133
give a man a fish, or teach
a man to fish, you know?

00:24:42.133 --> 00:24:44.633
And that's what
I wanted to do.

00:24:44.633 --> 00:24:47.333
I, I didn't just want to tell
people about one specific

00:24:47.333 --> 00:24:51.233
issue, or tell somebody that one
certain person was good or bad,

00:24:51.233 --> 00:24:53.133
I wanted to open
people's hearts so that

00:24:53.133 --> 00:24:55.867
whatever they viewed in the
world, whatever issue it was,

00:24:55.867 --> 00:24:58.400
that they had an open
heart and an open mind

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.200
to the perspective on it.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:04.133
And, so that, that was a
really big change in the way

00:25:04.133 --> 00:25:05.167
that I write music.

00:25:05.167 --> 00:25:07.633
And so, instead of
writing political songs,

00:25:07.633 --> 00:25:11.167
I write songs about whatever
I feel and then I go to those

00:25:11.167 --> 00:25:13.767
places that I see there's
conflict and I play them

00:25:13.767 --> 00:25:16.600
on the streets, and make films
about it and then I go back

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:19.333
and share what I've learned
with people in America

00:25:19.333 --> 00:25:21.767
and other places
around the world.

00:25:21.767 --> 00:25:33.400
[applause]
[pause]

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.267
All right, let's
play another song.

00:25:35.267 --> 00:25:42.900
[clapping] 
[guitar strumming]

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:45.900
This is a song -- last
summer, I was on tour

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:48.400
and my appendix ruptured
in the middle of the tour

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:53.633
and I was in the hospital
and every day I would,

00:25:53.633 --> 00:25:57.633
you know, I'd go to the
window and I'd look to see

00:25:57.633 --> 00:25:59.400
if the sun was
shining, you know?

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:00.767
And I'd pull the
curtain and I'd be like,

00:26:00.767 --> 00:26:02.167
"Is the sun shining?"

00:26:02.167 --> 00:26:04.700
And if it was, I'd
feel like, "Ahh, yes!

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:07.633
It's gonna be a great day
today and I'm gonna heal up."

00:26:07.633 --> 00:26:10.667
And if the sun wasn't shining,
I'd then pull the covers over

00:26:10.667 --> 00:26:13.133
my head and I'd try to imagine
someplace that was sunny,

00:26:13.133 --> 00:26:13.633
you know?

00:26:13.633 --> 00:26:15.900
Or I'd pick up a
guitar and I'd play

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:19.067
and I'd try to make sunshine
come out of the guitar and

00:26:19.067 --> 00:26:22.567
my friends would make me laugh
and my stitches would bust open

00:26:22.567 --> 00:26:25.833
and that would make me
laugh more, you know?

00:26:25.833 --> 00:26:29.133
And so, I made this
whole record,

00:26:29.133 --> 00:26:31.167
"The Sound of Sunshine,"
is all songs about

00:26:31.167 --> 00:26:36.433
overcoming adversity and so,
this is one of those songs.

00:26:36.433 --> 00:26:45.567
[guitar strumming]
[sings with guitar]

00:26:45.567 --> 00:26:47.967
"It's been a long time
coming that I had to say

00:26:47.967 --> 00:26:50.267
When I wake up in the
morning all I do is pray

00:26:50.267 --> 00:26:52.433
For some guidance and
protection on the streets today

00:26:52.433 --> 00:26:54.567
And an answer to the
questions I ask everyday

00:26:54.567 --> 00:26:57.400
So tell me why do the birds
that used to fly here

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.467
Tell me why do they
come to die here

00:26:59.467 --> 00:27:01.567
And all the kids that
used to run here

00:27:01.567 --> 00:27:05.100
Tell me why do they load
their guns here I remember,

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:08.200
in the days when we were
one heart no need to defend

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.433
I just wrap my arms around you

00:27:10.433 --> 00:27:12.467
Don't give up
This song is for you

00:27:12.467 --> 00:27:16.067
Hey, hey, hey, no matter
how life is today

00:27:16.067 --> 00:27:18.233
There's just one thing
that I got to say

00:27:18.233 --> 00:27:20.300
Won't let another
moment slip away

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:24.900

I hold on, I'm tryin'
to hold on,

I hold on,
hold on, hold on

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.567
From the tops of the buildings
to the streets below

00:27:40.567 --> 00:27:42.567
From the Wall Street
banks to the empty homes

00:27:42.567 --> 00:27:45.000
Between the lines of the
people standing all in a row

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.167
There's a crack in the
gutter where a flower grows

00:27:47.167 --> 00:27:49.267
Remindin' me that
everything is possible

00:27:49.267 --> 00:27:51.333
Yeah remindin' me that
nothing is impossible

00:27:51.333 --> 00:27:53.600
You gotta live for the one
that you love you know

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.800
You gotta love for the life
that you live you know

I hold on, I'm tryin' to hold on
Until the morning comes again,

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.867
I will remain with
you my friend

00:28:25.867 --> 00:28:28.400
We will dance
until the sun goes to

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.233
the place where it begun

00:28:30.233 --> 00:28:34.800
We will live to laugh
and cry another day

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.100
Don't let nobody ever tell
you that it couldn't be done

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:39.267
Don't let nobody ever tell
you that we couldn't be one

00:28:39.267 --> 00:28:41.700
Don't let nobody ever tell you
that it shouldn't be sung

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:44.933
Don't let nobody ever tell
you you're the only one

00:29:41.033 --> 00:29:44.467
hold on, I'm
tryin' to hold on,

00:29:44.467 --> 00:29:49.900
[audience clapping in rhythm]
hold on, hold on, hold on

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:52.767
Don't let nobody ever tell
you that it couldn't be done

00:29:52.767 --> 00:29:55.367
Don't let nobody ever tell
you that we couldn't be one

00:29:55.367 --> 00:29:58.433
Don't let nobody ever tell you
that it shouldn't be sung

00:29:58.433 --> 00:30:03.600
Don't let nobody ever tell
you you're the only one

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:08.367
Singin' hey, hey, hey, no
matter how life is today

00:30:08.367 --> 00:30:11.733
There's just one thing
that I got to say

00:30:11.733 --> 00:30:18.300
Won't let another moment
slip away I hold on"

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:24.867
[guitar] 
Thanks, ya'll.

00:30:24.867 --> 00:30:32.167
[applause]
&gt;&gt;presenter: All right.

00:30:32.167 --> 00:30:34.700
So, Michael, it looks like we
have one more question here

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:36.267
and for those of
you in the audience,

00:30:36.267 --> 00:30:38.267
if anybody has
any last questions,

00:30:38.267 --> 00:30:40.700
feel free to queue up
behind one of the microphones.

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:43.633
So, this last question
here comes from Suze

00:30:43.633 --> 00:30:44.667
in Mountain View.

00:30:44.667 --> 00:30:46.633
[reads question] 
"Michael, your website promotes

00:30:46.633 --> 00:30:48.333
health, fitness,
and organizations.

00:30:48.333 --> 00:30:50.233
Can you tell us about how
this and events like Power

00:30:50.233 --> 00:30:51.667
to the Peaceful happen?

00:30:51.667 --> 00:30:53.567
Do you take the ideas
and turn them into,

00:30:53.567 --> 00:30:55.033
how do you take the
ideas and turn them

00:30:55.033 --> 00:30:56.867
into meaningful action?"

00:30:56.867 --> 00:30:58.833
&gt;&gt;Franti: The
first part of the question,

00:30:58.833 --> 00:31:01.633
yeah, on our website we
want it to be a place

00:31:01.633 --> 00:31:06.467
where people come and don't
just check out our music,

00:31:06.467 --> 00:31:07.733
or look at when
our tour dates are.

00:31:07.733 --> 00:31:10.333
We want it to be a place
where there's a community

00:31:10.333 --> 00:31:12.467
that can hang out
and that can connect.

00:31:12.467 --> 00:31:13.733
Cause that's really
what our fans do.

00:31:13.733 --> 00:31:15.733
They travel to a lot of
different shows

00:31:15.733 --> 00:31:20.500
and our fans rage,
rage in age, haha.

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:22.533
They do rage in age.

00:31:22.533 --> 00:31:28.167
[laughter] From like, little
kids, you know, to their moms.

00:31:28.167 --> 00:31:32.200
And then 20 and 20-, you
know, college age kids

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.767
and then on up to like, 40
and 50 and 60 year olds,

00:31:34.767 --> 00:31:37.800
so there's, there's like a
really wide range of people.

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:42.400
So, we want our
site to be broad;

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.333
issues that would be broad.

00:31:43.333 --> 00:31:47.333
So we do have like a health
part of our site, a fitness.

00:31:47.333 --> 00:31:50.367
We promote a lot of different
social justice organizations

00:31:50.367 --> 00:31:54.833
and environmental
organizations and

00:31:54.833 --> 00:31:57.067
every year we do this big
festival in San Francisco

00:31:57.067 --> 00:31:59.400
called The Power to the
Peaceful and it started off --

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:02.367
[audience claps] 
Yeah. It started off being a day

00:32:02.367 --> 00:32:05.867
that we did on
September 11th, 1999.

00:32:05.867 --> 00:32:09.233
And it was a day of ardent
action that 150 different

00:32:09.233 --> 00:32:12.633
artists around the world did
different events for this man

00:32:12.633 --> 00:32:15.867
named Mumia Abu-Jamal who's
on Death Row in Pennsylvania.

00:32:15.867 --> 00:32:18.500
We felt like his case
deserved to be reheard

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:22.133
and so we selected the day 9/11

00:32:22.133 --> 00:32:24.867
because we wanted to say
this is an emergency.

00:32:24.867 --> 00:32:29.200
So, we put this on in 1999, 
and then again in 2000,

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.600
and then 2001, of course,

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:33.400
the attacks occurred
on September 11th.

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.767
So, we wanted this day,

00:32:35.767 --> 00:32:39.500
or the festival kind of
took a shift on that day

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.833
and we said, "We want this
day to be remembered

00:32:41.833 --> 00:32:46.167
not as a day to
beat the drums of war.

00:32:46.167 --> 00:32:48.967
We want our sadness
and our mourning to

00:32:48.967 --> 00:32:52.433
be something more meaningful.

00:32:52.433 --> 00:32:53.800
We want it to be a
day when we say,

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:57.700
'How can each of us do
something to make the world a

00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:00.400
better place, a more prosperous
place for more people?'"

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:04.367
And, and so that's what
the festival became,

00:33:04.367 --> 00:33:06.267
became a day where
we invite hundreds of

00:33:06.267 --> 00:33:08.767
different social justice and
environmental organizations

00:33:08.767 --> 00:33:11.100
out to the park
in San Francisco,

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:13.200
bring a lot of great
music, a lot of great food,

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.900
have activities for
kids and families,

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:20.700
and we do this giant free
concert for 50,000 people.

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:25.800
And the last part of
the question says,

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:29.433
"How do you take ideas and
turn them into meaning action?"

00:33:29.433 --> 00:33:32.633
And people ask me a lot,
they say, "What can I do?"

00:33:32.633 --> 00:33:37.233
And the best response
that I have come up with is,

00:33:37.233 --> 00:33:39.700
"Do what you can."

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:41.867
And what I mean by
that is I met a woman

00:33:41.867 --> 00:33:43.733
in Denver a few years back.

00:33:43.733 --> 00:33:46.333
She said, "You know, Michael, I
saw your film about going to

00:33:46.333 --> 00:33:51.667
Iraq and I thought what can
I do to change the world?

00:33:51.667 --> 00:33:54.133
I'm a hairdresser."

00:33:54.133 --> 00:34:00.000
And so what she did is she met
several women who were coming

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.867
because they were
having chemotherapy

00:34:01.867 --> 00:34:04.133
and they were
losing their hair.

00:34:04.133 --> 00:34:09.000
And so she decided to create
this one night every week

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.633
where she would do beauty
treatments, hair cutting,

00:34:13.633 --> 00:34:18.333
whatever, for women who are
undergoing chemotherapy.

00:34:18.333 --> 00:34:20.500
And I thought that
was just so incredible.

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:22.767
It's like, "What can I do?
Do what you can."

00:34:22.767 --> 00:34:25.767
And so, that's
what we try to do is,

00:34:25.767 --> 00:34:28.233
through our music and
through the events that we do,

00:34:28.233 --> 00:34:31.633
is encourage people
to, to find ways that,

00:34:31.633 --> 00:34:33.300
whatever it is that
your skill is to,

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:35.300
to give back, right?

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:38.867
&gt;&gt;presenter: So, we have
time for one more question.

00:34:38.867 --> 00:34:40.667
&gt;&gt;membermale7: Should
I keep it short,

00:34:40.667 --> 00:34:42.233
then? It's up to you?

00:34:42.233 --> 00:34:44.500
&gt;&gt;Franti: Go ahead,
as long as you want.

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:46.567
&gt;&gt;membermale7: I, I was,
I wanted to ask you

00:34:46.567 --> 00:34:49.067
a little bit about,
you mentioned before,

00:34:49.067 --> 00:34:52.167
but how the economic models
for music has changed and,

00:34:52.167 --> 00:34:56.400
and it seems like you're getting
paid more for performances

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:59.467
rather than the actual
production of the music now,

00:34:59.467 --> 00:35:02.667
which means you kinda
have to keep touring,

00:35:02.667 --> 00:35:03.767
keep performing
all the time.

00:35:03.767 --> 00:35:06.300
It seems like once you
reach a large body of work

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:08.267
that people are listening
to all the time, that that

00:35:08.267 --> 00:35:12.067
seems like something ideally
people would get paid for.

00:35:12.067 --> 00:35:16.333
I don't know if you have
any feelings about that and,

00:35:16.333 --> 00:35:18.467
and what the ideal
situation would be,

00:35:18.467 --> 00:35:20.400
or if just that people
are accepting reality

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.733
and that's not gonna
happen any time soon.

00:35:22.733 --> 00:35:25.867
&gt;&gt;Franti: I just think it's
a matter of time before

00:35:25.867 --> 00:35:28.700
there's a model that worked out

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:33.467
so that every time a
piece of music is traded,

00:35:33.467 --> 00:35:37.600
that it's somehow that
audio has actual audio,

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:41.267
is identified and that
every time it's traded,

00:35:41.267 --> 00:35:43.800
that there could be some
way that there was a royalty.

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:46.067
I don't know if it's
through subscribership

00:35:46.067 --> 00:35:50.633
or if it's through, you
know, some other means,

00:35:50.633 --> 00:35:54.900
but I think that in the
future we're just gonna look

00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:57.667
at this time as a little
bump in the road

00:35:57.667 --> 00:35:59.667
in terms of the sale of music.

00:35:59.667 --> 00:36:02.367
But, I'm not counting on that.

00:36:02.367 --> 00:36:06.800
I'm, I'm just gonna continue
to go out and play music for

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:07.867
whoever wants to do it.

00:36:07.867 --> 00:36:10.333
In part, because it's
how I earn my living,

00:36:10.333 --> 00:36:12.667
but mainly because
it's what I love to do,

00:36:12.667 --> 00:36:13.767
you know?

00:36:13.767 --> 00:36:17.700
And so, I think that, I mean,

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:21.167
we, we do a lot of other
stuff, so we find ways to;

00:36:21.167 --> 00:36:23.267
find hard things
that we could sell,

00:36:23.267 --> 00:36:24.767
like children's books.

00:36:24.767 --> 00:36:28.900
I just opened a yoga retreat
center in Bali that combines,

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:31.533
you know, my music and yoga,
which is another one of

00:36:31.533 --> 00:36:37.167
my passions and we have an
organic clothing company that

00:36:37.167 --> 00:36:40.800
does clothes that are beyond
just our regular tour t-shirts.

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:41.400
&gt;&gt;membermale7: Sure.

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:43.333
&gt;&gt;Franti: And so, we're
always trying to find ways

00:36:43.333 --> 00:36:47.400
that we can be enterprising
to keep it all afloat

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:51.533
and most of the time we're
going hand to mouth,

00:36:51.533 --> 00:36:56.300
but that's better than
going hand to no mouth.

00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:57.667
[Franti laughs]
[audience laughs]

00:36:57.667 --> 00:37:01.500
So, I feel really hopeful.

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:06.333
I feel more optimistic about
music today than ever before

00:37:06.333 --> 00:37:08.100
and the reason for that is that

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:09.667
I remember that
when I was a kid,

00:37:09.667 --> 00:37:12.800
everybody had like the 10 or 15
records in their collection

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:15.900
that they loved and then
when it turned to CDs,

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:17.900
everybody had like,
40 or 50 CDs

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:20.967
on one of those really cool,
black racks, you know?

00:37:20.967 --> 00:37:23.467
[female laughter] Like, from
Sharper Image or something,

00:37:23.467 --> 00:37:24.400
you know?

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:27.933
[audience laughs] And now, you
have whatever handheld device,

00:37:27.933 --> 00:37:30.667
be it your phone or your i-,
iPod, or whatever it is

00:37:30.667 --> 00:37:36.400
and you have thousands and
thousands of songs available.

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:40.733
And next, those songs
are gonna be somewhere,

00:37:40.733 --> 00:37:43.933
like in outer space on
a cloud, you know?

00:37:43.933 --> 00:37:47.700
[laughter] And all you
gotta do is just request it,

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:49.333
and it's there
for you, you know?

00:37:49.333 --> 00:37:52.100
And you can have millions
of songs at your disposal,

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:55.233
and so I feel like the
more access to music,

00:37:55.233 --> 00:37:58.000
the better it is for artists.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.167
And the artists of the
21st century have to

00:38:03.167 --> 00:38:06.567
become an artist who doesn't
just know how to play guitar,

00:38:06.567 --> 00:38:10.500
but you know how to use
Facebook and social networking

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:13.400
and you understand
how you can make money

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:16.000
beyond just selling
a piece of plastic.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.167
And as far as I'm concerned,

00:38:17.167 --> 00:38:20.500
the sooner those plastic things
go away, the better, so.

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:22.200
&gt;&gt;membermale7: On the
hand to mouth question,

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.900
you still eating
red beans and rice?

00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:24.600
&gt;&gt;Franti: I do--

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:26.367
[audience laughs] I still
eat red beans and rice.

00:38:26.367 --> 00:38:27.500
It's my favorite thing.

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:31.433
[applause]
&gt;&gt;presenter: All right.

00:38:31.433 --> 00:38:33.500
Michael, Thank you
for a very awesome show.

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:34.600
Let's close with one song.

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:36.633
&gt;&gt;Franti: Alright, cool.

00:38:36.633 --> 00:38:38.633
Let's tune this guitar.

00:38:38.633 --> 00:38:41.067
This is a song -- I mentioned
Woody Harrelson earlier --

00:38:41.067 --> 00:38:43.700
this is a song I wrote
in Woody's bathroom.

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:48.267
[laughter] And Woody invited me
to his house 'cause he was off

00:38:48.267 --> 00:38:52.400
makin' a movie somewhere and
we've been buddies for awhile

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.267
and he said, "You know,
you're recording in LA,

00:38:54.267 --> 00:38:56.767
you should just hang out at my
house 'cause it's empty and,

00:38:56.767 --> 00:39:01.767
and so I was in the
shower at Woody's house

00:39:01.767 --> 00:39:04.833
and I put some guitar
chords down on my iPod

00:39:04.833 --> 00:39:07.800
and I was playing
them back in the shower

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:12.167
and I started getting
this great idea.

00:39:12.167 --> 00:39:14.900
And you know when
you have a great idea,

00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:16.733
you have to write
it down somewhere,

00:39:16.733 --> 00:39:17.033
you know?

00:39:17.033 --> 00:39:20.700
You have to like, put it
on something and I, I, I,

00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:23.300
I was inspired just going
in the bathroom here today

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:25.733
because there's all these great
ideas up in the bathroom--

00:39:25.733 --> 00:39:29.133
[laughter] and I think that
it's a really great thing to,

00:39:29.133 --> 00:39:31.233
actually, is like, if
you have an idea,

00:39:31.233 --> 00:39:34.000
that there should be a space
that you could write it down

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.667
wherever you were so that
when other people came by,

00:39:36.667 --> 00:39:38.467
that they could maybe
add something to that,

00:39:38.467 --> 00:39:40.733
or, or it could
inspire them in some way.

00:39:40.733 --> 00:39:45.167
So, Woody has this
great space in his,

00:39:45.167 --> 00:39:49.767
in his shower and
I got this idea.

00:39:49.767 --> 00:39:52.433
It was flowing, you know, and
I was like vibing off Woody's

00:39:52.433 --> 00:39:57.533
energy there, man, and,--
[laughter] and I get this idea

00:39:57.533 --> 00:39:59.067
and I go, "I gotta
write this down,

00:39:59.067 --> 00:40:02.800
so I look all over
and I can't find a pen

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:04.200
and I looked everywhere.

00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:07.833
And so, I get this idea like,

00:40:07.833 --> 00:40:09.400
Oh, I know, I'll
just put it on the,

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:15.667
on the glass in the, on the,
on the shower and so like,

00:40:15.667 --> 00:40:17.467
Hey, I got that one licked.

00:40:17.467 --> 00:40:19.633
I write it all, I write
this whole song down

00:40:19.633 --> 00:40:22.267
and then I get out of the
shower and I turn around

00:40:22.267 --> 00:40:24.767
and the glass is
just evaporating.

00:40:24.767 --> 00:40:29.533
And so I panic and I pick up
my iPod and I take a picture.

00:40:29.533 --> 00:40:32.267
I'm like, "Click.
Technology delivers."

00:40:32.267 --> 00:40:34.700
[laughter] I'm
feeling really, you know,

00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:40.633
techy at the time, and then
I put it into Photoshop

00:40:40.633 --> 00:40:42.967
and of course, it's
inside out and backwards 

00:40:42.967 --> 00:40:47.167
and I have to call my
friend back home to

00:40:47.167 --> 00:40:48.867
walk me through
flipping the picture,

00:40:48.867 --> 00:40:50.900
which for me was like
trying to land a 747--

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:56.667
[laughter] on like a piece of
ice in the middle of the ocean.

00:40:56.667 --> 00:41:00.133
And so, I get it turned inside
out and backwards right way,

00:41:00.133 --> 00:41:01.900
and I, I read the lyrics
and I'm like feeling,

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:03.700
"oh, this is great, like
a hit song, you know?

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:07.067
I think I wrote," and so I'm
sitting on Woody's toilet

00:41:07.067 --> 00:41:09.300
and he calls and he's like,

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:11.900
"Michael, how's, how's, how's
the song writing going?"

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:14.200
And I'm like, "Woody,
its going great, man.

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:17.133
I think I wrote a hit
song in your bathroom."

00:41:17.133 --> 00:41:21.667
[laughter] And he says, "Is
it a number 1 or a number 2?"

00:41:21.667 --> 00:41:26.733
[laughter and clapping] 
So, this is a song.

00:41:26.733 --> 00:41:30.000
In, in 23 years we
had never had a song

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.133
in the top 20,000 before
until this song.

00:41:34.133 --> 00:41:36.933
And this song actually made
it into the Top 20 last year

00:41:36.933 --> 00:41:38.967
and if you know it, sing
along. It goes like this:

00:41:38.967 --> 00:41:43.133
[sings] "I say hey
I'll be gone today

00:41:43.133 --> 00:41:45.667
But I'll be back
coming around the way

00:41:45.667 --> 00:41:49.000
It seems like everywhere I go

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.967
The more I see

00:41:50.967 --> 00:41:53.167

00:41:53.167 --> 00:42:00.233

I've been a lot of
places all around the way

00:42:31.933 --> 00:42:34.233
I've seen a lot joy and
I've seen a lot of pain

00:42:34.233 --> 00:42:36.300
But I don't want to write a
love song for the world,

00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:38.667
I just want to write a
song about a boy and a girl

00:42:38.667 --> 00:42:40.600
Junkies on the corner
always callin' my name

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:43.067
And the kids on the
corner playin' ghetto games

00:42:43.067 --> 00:42:45.100
When I saw you getting
down well I hoped it was you

00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:47.533
And when I looked into
your eyes I knew it was true

00:42:47.533 --> 00:42:49.967
I say Hey I'll be gone today

love you I love you"

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.533
We need some more
kids up here.

00:43:06.533 --> 00:43:07.967
We need some more

00:43:07.967 --> 00:43:09.067
