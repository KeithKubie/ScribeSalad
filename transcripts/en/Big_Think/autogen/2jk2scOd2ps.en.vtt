been of great interest to me I hope it

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980
been of great interest to me I hope it
 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.950
been of great interest to me I hope it
would be interesting to you I've studied

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960
would be interesting to you I've studied
 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.220
would be interesting to you I've studied
the brain for many years using

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230
the brain for many years using
 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.799
the brain for many years using
technology and recently I've been struck

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809
technology and recently I've been struck
 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.349
technology and recently I've been struck
by how technology seems to be altering

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359
by how technology seems to be altering
 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.390
by how technology seems to be altering
our lives and wondered how it's altering

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400
our lives and wondered how it's altering
 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.420
our lives and wondered how it's altering
our brains so to try to get at that

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430
our brains so to try to get at that
 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.109
our brains so to try to get at that
question it brings up issues of

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119
question it brings up issues of
 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.900
question it brings up issues of
creativity and technology and we know

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910
creativity and technology and we know
 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.519
creativity and technology and we know
it's accelerating the pace of life

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529
it's accelerating the pace of life
 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.100
it's accelerating the pace of life
that's reducing the time for thoughtful

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110
that's reducing the time for thoughtful
 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.560
that's reducing the time for thoughtful
reflection but ironically the internet

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570
reflection but ironically the internet
 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.030
reflection but ironically the internet
and all this new technology was

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040
and all this new technology was
 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.060
and all this new technology was
developed to free up time to help us

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070
developed to free up time to help us
 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.060
developed to free up time to help us
become more thoughtful and creative now

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070
become more thoughtful and creative now
 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.100
become more thoughtful and creative now
to get a better idea of some of these

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110
to get a better idea of some of these
 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.340
to get a better idea of some of these
issues we've heard about how Google

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350
issues we've heard about how Google
 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.100
issues we've heard about how Google
might be making a stupid in at UCLA we

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110
might be making a stupid in at UCLA we
 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.840
might be making a stupid in at UCLA we
wanted to ask what really is going on

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850
wanted to ask what really is going on
 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.700
wanted to ask what really is going on
with Google is it making us smart is it

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710
with Google is it making us smart is it
 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.200
with Google is it making us smart is it
making us stupid

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210
making us stupid
 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.420
making us stupid
so we raised a bit of money got some

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430
so we raised a bit of money got some
 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.760
so we raised a bit of money got some
collaborators together there and we

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770
collaborators together there and we
 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.380
collaborators together there and we
devised an experiment to try to

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390
devised an experiment to try to
 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.859
devised an experiment to try to
understand how search is affecting our

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869
understand how search is affecting our
 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.770
understand how search is affecting our
brains now I wanted to know what does

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780
brains now I wanted to know what does
 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.420
brains now I wanted to know what does
the brain look like the first time it

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430
the brain look like the first time it
 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.609
the brain look like the first time it
searches online so I had to recruit

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619
searches online so I had to recruit
 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.350
searches online so I had to recruit
people who had never searched online I

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360
people who had never searched online I
 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.660
people who had never searched online I
quickly learned I couldn't recruit them

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670
quickly learned I couldn't recruit them
 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.010
quickly learned I couldn't recruit them
online and so we've got people like this

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020
online and so we've got people like this
 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.969
online and so we've got people like this
congratulations you're the last person

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979
congratulations you're the last person
 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.070
congratulations you're the last person
on earth to get an email account and

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080
on earth to get an email account and
 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.679
on earth to get an email account and
then after looking for some time we

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689
then after looking for some time we
 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.020
then after looking for some time we
found some older people about a dozen of

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030
found some older people about a dozen of
 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.170
found some older people about a dozen of
them who we called Internet naive and we

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180
them who we called Internet naive and we
 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.880
them who we called Internet naive and we
match them up with another dozen who

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890
match them up with another dozen who
 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.340
match them up with another dozen who
were internet savvy mostly women

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350
were internet savvy mostly women
 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.499
were internet savvy mostly women
well-educated as far as we could tell

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509
well-educated as far as we could tell
 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.660
well-educated as far as we could tell
the only way that groups differed was

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670
the only way that groups differed was
 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.050
the only way that groups differed was
according to their computer experience

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060
according to their computer experience
 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.359
according to their computer experience
now to do this experiment we used an MRI

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369
now to do this experiment we used an MRI
 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.889
now to do this experiment we used an MRI
scanner and those of you who have been

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899
scanner and those of you who have been
 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.100
scanner and those of you who have been
in the narrow tube no it's too narrow to

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110
in the narrow tube no it's too narrow to
 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.810
in the narrow tube no it's too narrow to
get a computer in there so we use these

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820
get a computer in there so we use these
 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.170
get a computer in there so we use these
special goggles to show the volunteers

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180
special goggles to show the volunteers
 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.679
special goggles to show the volunteers
either a bar and we said concentrate on

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689
either a bar and we said concentrate on
 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.179
either a bar and we said concentrate on
it so we could factor out what the brain

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189
it so we could factor out what the brain
 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.310
it so we could factor out what the brain
does when it pays attention then we had

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320
does when it pays attention then we had
 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.100
does when it pays attention then we had
another control task reading a simulated

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110
another control task reading a simulated
 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.960
another control task reading a simulated
book page and then we had these

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970
book page and then we had these
 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.020
book page and then we had these
simulated internet pages and there was a

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030
simulated internet pages and there was a
 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.250
simulated internet pages and there was a
little key

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260
little key
 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.869
little key
or next to their side so they could

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879
or next to their side so they could
 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.670
or next to their side so they could
operate a mouse and and here's what we

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680
operate a mouse and and here's what we
 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.119
operate a mouse and and here's what we
found here we see the breath the

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129
found here we see the breath the
 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.850
found here we see the breath the
computer adding up what's happening in

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860
computer adding up what's happening in
 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.319
computer adding up what's happening in
the brain the colored area show you

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329
the brain the colored area show you
 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:26.990
the brain the colored area show you
where your brain is working the first if

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000
where your brain is working the first if
 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.670
where your brain is working the first if
you're Internet naive and you're reading

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680
you're Internet naive and you're reading
 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.199
you're Internet naive and you're reading
a book page so there's a little bit of

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209
a book page so there's a little bit of
 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.360
a book page so there's a little bit of
activity in the visual area of the brain

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370
activity in the visual area of the brain
 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.180
activity in the visual area of the brain
memory verbal areas not too surprising

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190
memory verbal areas not too surprising
 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.699
memory verbal areas not too surprising
so here are Internet naive people

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709
so here are Internet naive people
 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.759
so here are Internet naive people
searching online for the first time look

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769
searching online for the first time look
 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.589
searching online for the first time look
the same I was a little bit disappointed

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599
the same I was a little bit disappointed
 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:43.520
the same I was a little bit disappointed
with the experiment

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530
with the experiment
 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.280
with the experiment
so we went on we took the internet savvy

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290
so we went on we took the internet savvy
 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.619
so we went on we took the internet savvy
people we had them search online excuse

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629
people we had them search online excuse
 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.240
people we had them search online excuse
me to read a book page looked the same

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250
me to read a book page looked the same
 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.789
me to read a book page looked the same
and here was a big payoff when we saw

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799
and here was a big payoff when we saw
 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.619
and here was a big payoff when we saw
the internet savvy people searching

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629
the internet savvy people searching
 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:56.240
the internet savvy people searching
online there was more than two fold

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250
online there was more than two fold
 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.610
online there was more than two fold
increased activity in the brain so

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620
increased activity in the brain so
 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.860
increased activity in the brain so
here's your brain reading a book and

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870
here's your brain reading a book and
 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.680
here's your brain reading a book and
here's your brain on Google or Bing

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690
here's your brain on Google or Bing
 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.740
here's your brain on Google or Bing
so the headlines where Google is making

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750
so the headlines where Google is making
 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.360
so the headlines where Google is making
us smart but we really didn't show that

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370
us smart but we really didn't show that
 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.160
us smart but we really didn't show that
we just found that if you had prior

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170
we just found that if you had prior
 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.410
we just found that if you had prior
experience it's activating your brain

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420
experience it's activating your brain
 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.690
experience it's activating your brain
now part two of the experiment we took

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700
now part two of the experiment we took
 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.910
now part two of the experiment we took
the internet naive people and we trained

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920
the internet naive people and we trained
 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.770
the internet naive people and we trained
them we said for an hour day we want you

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780
them we said for an hour day we want you
 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.659
them we said for an hour day we want you
to search online and we found there were

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:20.669
to search online and we found there were
 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:22.580
to search online and we found there were
significant increases in brain activity

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590
significant increases in brain activity
 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.409
significant increases in brain activity
in the front part of the brain the

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:24.419
in the front part of the brain the
 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:26.119
in the front part of the brain the
thinking part of the brain that makes

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129
thinking part of the brain that makes
 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:28.789
thinking part of the brain that makes
decisions holds in short-term memory the

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799
decisions holds in short-term memory the
 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.680
decisions holds in short-term memory the
kinds of functions we know we need to

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690
kinds of functions we know we need to
 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.500
kinds of functions we know we need to
use to search online so here's what I

use to search online so here's what I
 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.270
use to search online so here's what I
think's happening in these kinds of

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280
think's happening in these kinds of
 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.789
think's happening in these kinds of
experiments initially when we're

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799
experiments initially when we're
 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.729
experiments initially when we're
presented with an unusual task we don't

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739
presented with an unusual task we don't
 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:41.900
presented with an unusual task we don't
know what to do and there's not much

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910
know what to do and there's not much
 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.119

brain activity once we figure out a

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.129
brain activity once we figure out a
 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:46.390
brain activity once we figure out a
strategy we see a surge of

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400
strategy we see a surge of
 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.369
strategy we see a surge of
neurocircuitry activation but once the

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379
neurocircuitry activation but once the
 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.860
neurocircuitry activation but once the
task becomes routine we see a decrease

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870
task becomes routine we see a decrease
 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.479
task becomes routine we see a decrease
in activity representing brain

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489
in activity representing brain
 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.229

does activate certain parts of the brain

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360
does activate certain parts of the brain
 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.600
does activate certain parts of the brain
that are important for memory so what

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610
that are important for memory so what
 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:33.950
that are important for memory so what
about this question is technology

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960
about this question is technology

today it's probably a lot fewer than

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900
today it's probably a lot fewer than
 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.560
today it's probably a lot fewer than
before and so there's this concern that

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570
before and so there's this concern that
 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.450
before and so there's this concern that

hippocampus and my answer to that is we

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580
hippocampus and my answer to that is we
 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.840

don't want to look up what their name is
 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.220
don't want to look up what their name is
in your PDA and so you want to use

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230
in your PDA and so you want to use
 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.140
in your PDA and so you want to use
memory techniques but for pretty much

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150
