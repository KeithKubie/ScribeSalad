[Clapping]

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.740
John Micklethwait: Thank you very much.
As Mark said, I'm happy to answer questions

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.540
about almost as many things as God, but with
slightly less omniscience.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:24.950
I'm going to employ two cheap tricks, and
the first is to claim that my aim today is

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.170
to have a conversation.
For those of you -- I know Peter Barron here

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.750
 -- for those of us who've covered politics,
the phrase anybody standing in front of you

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.470
claiming they want to have a conversation
is more or less suicidal, because there is

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.300
no more vacuous phrase in politics.
It's usually an excuse for somebody who has

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.940
nothing at all to say.
There was a moment the other day when Gordon

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.560
Brown began a speech with that phrase, which
made me almost inherently worry about what

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.760
he was up to.
But in this particular time, my aim was to

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.840
talk probably about 25 minutes about the idea
of this book and the idea of "God is back.”

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.740
And then, open up to conversation, both in
terms of If you would ask about the book,

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.820
but also If you want to ask about broader
things.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:15.360
As I said, I'm happy to answer about anything
other than really, technology.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.910
I think I'll begin with where the book begins.
And the book begins in a sitting room -- a

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:28.070
little smaller than this.
About half the size of this room -- in Shanghai.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.310
It's owned by a man who -- for the sake of
argument -- we'll call Wang, who is a young

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.670
Chinese man who works for a company, which
I've probably described as a competitor/partner

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.400
of Google's.
Who we don't identify.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.100
In the room gathered, there's a couple of
academics, there's couple of scientists who

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.229
work on stem cells, there's two CEOs, someone's
just flown in from Philadelphia, where he

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:59.580
was away for the weekend.
What we're in is a house church in Shanghai.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.070
And this is the center of -- what I would
argue is -- the most remarkable religious

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.220
explosion, arguably in some ways, since the
very beginnings of Christianity in the Roman

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.230
Empire.
Already, China, I would argue, has as many

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.850
as 100 million Christians.
There are certainly more members -- more people

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.040
going to church each week in China -- than
there are members of the Communist Party,

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.451
around 70 million members of the Communist
Party.

00:02:25.451 --> 00:02:33.889
Why is this source of strength -- the source
of power -- why has it cropped up?

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:36.859
Because you go to a house church.
What they do is they spend about two to three

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:42.329
hours sitting there reading one bit of a text
and then discussing it.

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:46.599
It's admirably high-tech to some extent.
It's full of new gadgets.

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.799
They use computers.
They use the Internet to download hymns.

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:55.209
And they talk repeatedly -- mainly led by
this guy, who as I said, we'll call Wang.

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.450
And he goes in very, heavy detail for a particular
bit.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.359
But there's a group of people who are obsessed
by this.

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:07.219
Why is China suddenly discovering religion
in such a big way?

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:11.400
I think it's partly -- and this is a sort
of theme which will crop up repeatedly throughout

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.239
this talk -- it's partly a kind of demand
for meaning.

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.859
You have a country which has gone through
an enormous change.

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:25.989
One statistic about China -- I'm going to
slightly mess it up -- I think in one year,

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:36.290
1997 or 1998, more people moved from the countryside
to the cities in China than crossed the Atlantic

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.999
in the century before 1920.
So, you have more social dislocation than

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:45.760
before.
You have a vacuum where there is not much

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.269
meaning at all, in the sense that the Communist
ideology has gone, but people want something

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.060
new to structure their lives around.
And this comes through very, very firmly in

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.540
the house churches.
But it's also, I think, a question of supply.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.049
It's to do with the fact that the Internet
is providing ever new ways to reach it.

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:09.739
It's to do with the fact that US-style missionaries
are rushing around China trying to spur faith

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:14.889
forwards -- either Americans or else Koreans,
particularly, are pushing it.

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:19.560
It's also bizarrely -- and this, I think,
goes to the apex of our book, which is about

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.260
religion and politics -- it's also a lot to
do with government policy.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.540
Because the interesting thing about that room
is, I think, in that case there were 26 people

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.640
in the room.
But there is a policy in China -- a rule -- which

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:36.290
says that whenever any meeting gets to 25
people, beyond that you need government permission.

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:41.170
And what the Chinese government has done,
almost single handedly -- the only previous

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.760
people who I think have done this were actually
the Roman emperors -- was by setting a limit

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.380
on how many people can gather together, they
have hit the most explosive means of growing

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.760
religion yet known.
Because the moment they get to about 24, 25,

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.820
26, neighbors begin to complain, people go
for the car spaces outside.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.780
It's more routine things like that, rather
than people actually getting really angry

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.160
about it.
And the house church automatically splits.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.880
And so, the one I went to, within a couple
of weeks, it split up into two.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:16.370
One of them was sited -- went back to the
American company where -- meets in the American

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:21.000
company where Wang works.
And each time it splits, it grows.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.730
And that is what is pushing it ahead.
More generally I think -- what's interesting

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:30.750
 -- and the reason we begin with Wang, is
not just because it's fascinating that religion

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.790
is growing so rapidly in a place that was
thought to have got rid of it completely.

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:39.000
And it's not just Protestantism, but it is
mostly that.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.180
It's also to do with the fact that this is
beginning to impact politics.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:50.000
Because, if you talk to the Chinese leadership,
they are in a deeply-divided position over

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.780
this amazing phenomenon, which is happening
within their borders.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:59.560
One part of them, is very -- I suppose -- pleased
about the idea that there is a sort of social

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.750
glue developing.
There's something that they can use to bond

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.680
their country together.
They're conscious of the fact that religion

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.919
is useful to that extent.
Indeed, if you look at the official pronouncements

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:15.660
 -- people like Hu Jintao -- they've gone
from Mao, despising, cursing religion, driving

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:20.300
people out, killing priests, killing anyone
who came towards them -- towards an official

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.490
policy at least of welcoming them, of having
established churches, which are still relatively

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.490
small.
There's around 20 million people.

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:32.390
The official statistics show in China that
around -- I think it's 25 million -- now go

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.140
to church each week.
Those are the people going to the established

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:39.010
churches.
By any guess, the people going to house churches

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:42.410
are three or four times as big.
So, it's purely a matter of how much you measure

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.230
it.
But there are official churches.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.930
They separate Christians from Catholics, which
is an interesting division.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.970
That is the way in which they choose to do
it.

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:55.740
One half of official China is welcoming religion.
The other half is deeply frightened by it.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:00.020
Why?
Because in Chinese history, religion -- particularly

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.000
Christian religions -- have always been created
with difficulty.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.060
You have the Taiping Rebellion back in the
19th century.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:13.620
They also strangely, I think, give the pope
 -- perhaps Pope John Paul II, slightly greater

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:18.280
credit than many outsiders would do for his
role in bringing down the Soviet Empire.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.800
Above all though, it's a question of a big,
social organization.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.470
Already, as I said, the Chinese church is
bigger than the Communist Party.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:29.450
It's also already pretty close to being the
largest NGO in the country.

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.610
These people are beginning to set up schools,
they're doing some health care.

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:36.250
They're already a force within the country.
And, if the Chinese government was already

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:40.910
worried about Falun Gong, the idea of a group
of people with such a clear connection to

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:46.889
the West -- is, I think, difficult for them.
And so, they split between those two feelings.

00:07:46.889 --> 00:07:52.700
One half of them desperate to kind of cling
on -- to use religion for social purposes.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.780
The other bit deeply upset about what it could
do.

00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:00.669
And that is very much what this book is about.
This book is about, on the one hand, saying,

00:08:00.669 --> 00:08:05.860
"Wake up," if you're in Western Europe.
Because basically, whether we like it or not

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:11.730
 -- and this is not a book written to either
propagate or denounce religion -- wake up,

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:14.700
because around the rest of the world, religion
is doing extremely well.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:20.540
But that brings with it political consequences,
both good and bad.

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:26.600
If in ten years time you read about Chinese
Christians helping usher in a new thing of

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.150
democracy in China, well, that would be good.
If, on the other hand, you see very fierce

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:34.800
clamp-downs and difficulties, well, that is
perhaps less persuasive.

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:40.529
I should stress that the title of this book
is very much a conclusion, not a thesis that

00:08:40.529 --> 00:08:44.219
we took into it.
It's basically, at its core, a work of journalism.

00:08:44.219 --> 00:08:48.920
It was two people who originally thought about
writing a book about religion in America.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:53.089
And then we started from the presumption that
America looked something of an exception.

00:08:53.089 --> 00:08:58.309
But then, when you actually look at the numbers.
Actually the whole question, the whole ideology,

00:08:58.309 --> 00:09:04.020
which I deny it being -- it had been brought
up by one atheist, the other was Catholic

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:10.300
 -- the ideology in which we've been brought
up in was the idea that religion was bound

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:13.110
to disappear.
And yet, you look around the world, and that

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:16.300
just isn't true.
It's true of Western Europe; it's not true

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.899
of everywhere else.
Indeed, religion on the whole, is doing -- if

00:09:18.899 --> 00:09:22.910
anything -- rather better.
The proportion of people belonging to the

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:28.180
main religions has risen from roughly 60 percent
to 70 percent even in the conditions when

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:31.290
people thought it was going backwards.
You look at Asia, you look at Latin America,

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:37.350
you look at Africa, and this book essentially
is a journalistic foray going around the world

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:42.310
and reporting back what exactly we saw.
And, in fact, it gets more difficult than

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:46.430
that for the tradition in which we were brought
up in -- this idea that, whether we liked

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:50.649
it or not, religion was bound to go down.
There are two other very strange things which

00:09:50.649 --> 00:09:54.949
are happening around the world.
Firstly, the wrong sorts of religion are the

00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:58.579
ones doing well.
In the 60's and 70's -- certainly when I was

00:09:58.579 --> 00:10:02.100
being taught -- the general assumption was
that any kind of religions which would survive,

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:06.279
would be the sort of -- the cleverest sort.
They'd be ones where you'd have sort of Graham

00:10:06.279 --> 00:10:12.199
Greene-ish doubting Catholicism.
You would have very clever Anglicanism, which

00:10:12.199 --> 00:10:15.449
managed to accommodate to all the new sort
of fluxes of society.

00:10:15.449 --> 00:10:20.180
In fact, on the whole, it tends to be the
most emotional ones -- Islam to some extent.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:26.480
But you've also got the push of Pentacostalism.
Pentacostalism -- Wang was one of them -- is

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:31.459
the most successful religion of the past century.
It started in the back streets of Los Angeles

00:10:31.459 --> 00:10:34.369
in 1908.
There are now as many as 600 million, 700

00:10:34.369 --> 00:10:37.480
million Charismatics or Renewalists around
the world.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:43.220
This is the most emotional form of religion.
I've been to an exorcism in Brazil, which

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:47.940
I'm happy to describe.
It is not necessarily something based around

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:51.399
the mind.
And to make it even more difficult for those

00:10:51.399 --> 00:10:56.480
apostles of secularism -- the whole idea in
which we were brought up in -- is the wrong

00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:03.129
sort of people are flooding towards religion.
It's not -- as is often depicted even occasionally

00:11:03.129 --> 00:11:08.930
on, or used to even occasionally be on organizations
like the BBC -- if you go to America, megachurchs

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:17.939
are not being set up in the middle of nowhere,
run by useless hicks in the deeper, darker

00:11:17.939 --> 00:11:22.089
bits of North America.
They are in the gleaming suburbs beside malls

00:11:22.089 --> 00:11:25.889
with Tiffanies and whatever.
And it's the same pretty much around the world.

00:11:25.889 --> 00:11:30.660
The people in Wang's church were not the people
who are at the bottom of Chinese society.

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.779
They were the people struggling to go to the
top.

00:11:32.779 --> 00:11:37.319
If you look at Hindu, if you look at the rise
of the BJP in India, you look at the growth

00:11:37.319 --> 00:11:44.930
of the AK party in Turkey, again you see exactly
the sort of prosperous bourgeoisie -- which

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:51.100
the very secular founders of India and Turkey,
Ataturk and Naru -- exactly the people they

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:54.559
wanted to create.
It would cast aside all the suspicion.

00:11:54.559 --> 00:11:58.269
They are exactly the people who are rushing
towards religion.

00:11:58.269 --> 00:12:03.529
So, what is going on?
And we argue really, it's a tale of two revolutions.

00:12:03.529 --> 00:12:07.720
The first one is the French.
And that was a revolution against the Ancien

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.870
regime.
And it was a revolution very much against

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:14.610
the church as well.
And that European tradition -- of seeing progress

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:19.140
heading in one direction and religion heading
in another -- was being, I think, carried

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:22.889
forward, by the intellectuals who've dominated
this debate ever since.

00:12:22.889 --> 00:12:28.730
If you think of the tradition I was brought
up in of Freud, Marx, Darwin, Nietzsche.

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:35.700
All these people repeatedly push forward the
idea that religion was to move to the side.

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:38.690
And the interesting thing is that -- almost
exactly the same time as you have the French

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:43.499
Revolution, you had the American Revolution,
which whatever it was, was not remotely against

00:12:43.499 --> 00:12:48.879
religion.
The interesting point about American religiosity

00:12:48.879 --> 00:12:54.579
 -- and really what we're saying is that American
religion, which is going to be the dominant

00:12:54.579 --> 00:12:58.009
form, not necessarily, I'm not saying the
world is going to go universally Christian

00:12:58.009 --> 00:13:04.879
or universally evangelical -- the equivalent
if you want, of Google, in -- I don't believe

00:13:04.879 --> 00:13:10.220
I'm saying this -- the equivalent of a leading,
software company dominating its particular

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:13.311
niche, is actually American religiosity.
That is the one.

00:13:13.311 --> 00:13:17.209
That is the model which the Chinese are copying.
It's the model which is pushing through Latin

00:13:17.209 --> 00:13:18.569
America.
It's the model which is pushing through Africa.

00:13:18.569 --> 00:13:22.019
And it's the model which, I think, will probably
have some run in Europe.

00:13:22.019 --> 00:13:27.240
And if you look at where that came from, it
didn't really exist before the American Revolution.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:31.619
If you go before the American Revolution,
America is basically just as useless as Europe

00:13:31.619 --> 00:13:36.279
when it comes to revolution.
So it comes to religion.

00:13:36.279 --> 00:13:40.319
There was an established church.
Things weren't going particularly well.

00:13:40.319 --> 00:13:45.029
Even Salem, the place which Miller used for
"The Crucible".

00:13:45.029 --> 00:13:50.610
There, 83 percent of households had no religious
identification.

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:53.871
And the reason why is that, we always have
this vision of America as this place set up

00:13:53.871 --> 00:13:57.749
by puritanical starters.
By the founding fathers -- not by the founding

00:13:57.749 --> 00:14:01.879
fathers -- by the original kind of Mayflower
lord.

00:14:01.879 --> 00:14:05.179
Well, that's true.
The original lot were kind of these die-hard,

00:14:05.179 --> 00:14:08.660
religious fanatics.
The people who came straight afterwards were

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:12.889
often people who went there -- some of them,
many of them were sent there against their

00:14:12.889 --> 00:14:16.180
will.
There was a vast amount of young men who would

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:22.009
have gone to prison or perhaps, even to Australia
in later times, but were then sent to America.

00:14:22.009 --> 00:14:24.189
These were not people who were remotely interested
in religion.

00:14:24.189 --> 00:14:29.199
The American religion, all the bishop's letters.
There were one or two "Great Awakenings,"

00:14:29.199 --> 00:14:33.639
as they were called, but by and large, America
didn't seem that different to Europe.

00:14:33.639 --> 00:14:38.660
And why did it change?
It changed, I think, because of two documents.

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:43.480
If you need to understand why religion can
spread, why it does work, you really only

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:48.699
need two documents to understand it.
The first is the U.S. Constitution, because

00:14:48.699 --> 00:14:52.179
the U.S.
Constitution had that brilliant idea of "separating

00:14:52.179 --> 00:14:55.380
church from state.”
And what happened in America was, before they

00:14:55.380 --> 00:15:01.019
did that, there wasn't competition.
Once they did do that, it changed dramatically.

00:15:01.019 --> 00:15:06.360
The Methodists, for instance, converted around
an eighth of the country within a generation,

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:10.360
because they were able to get out there.
Their people who were Methodist ministers

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:16.989
were not pushed to -- they didn't rely on
establishment to keep pushing them up.

00:15:16.989 --> 00:15:21.019
On this side of the Atlantic, in Britain,
the Methodists were always in a bit of difficulty

00:15:21.019 --> 00:15:24.000
about how they dealt with an established church
 -- whether they were on the inside of the

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.839
political system, whether they were outside.
And in America, they were just another faith

00:15:26.839 --> 00:15:31.360
competing against others.
And that brings me to the second document,

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:36.189
which I think explains an enormous amount,
which is Adam Smith's "Wealth of Nations.”

00:15:36.189 --> 00:15:38.760
People forget that there is part of that which
deals with this.

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:44.189
There's a brilliant discussion between Adam
Smith who looked and said, "Wherever you have

00:15:44.189 --> 00:15:48.239
an established clergy, you're not going to
have religion doing particularly well.”

00:15:48.239 --> 00:15:53.009
And David Hume, who read this, and was utterly
horrified by this, because he loathed religion,

00:15:53.009 --> 00:15:57.749
very much came from that early tradition.
And he begged Smith not to include it, because

00:15:57.749 --> 00:16:01.879
he said, "Once people at the Church of England
read this, they'll realize how stupid they

00:16:01.879 --> 00:16:04.429
are, and they'll start having the American
system of competing religions.”

00:16:04.429 --> 00:16:11.411
But Smith persevered, not for the last time.
And, if you look at what's happened in America,

00:16:11.411 --> 00:16:15.430
you see a relentless succession of waves.
You have the Methodists first, but then you

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:18.910
have the Baptists.
Catholics, actually, in America competed amazingly

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:21.639
successfully, because they weren't really
an established church.

00:16:21.639 --> 00:16:23.430
And you see that all the way through to the
Pentecostals now.

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:28.139
And what you're now seeing around the world
is that phenomenon has gone global like so

00:16:28.139 --> 00:16:31.660
many other ones.
Pentacostalism, as I mentioned, you can go

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:35.029
to all sorts of places and see amazing things
going on.

00:16:35.029 --> 00:16:39.569
If you want to look at big mega-churches,
five out of the ten biggest ones in the world

00:16:39.569 --> 00:16:42.630
are in Korea.
I went to one where there's about 800,000

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:44.649
people.
They're members of one church.

00:16:44.649 --> 00:16:48.890
It's almost like attending a massive football
match, several times over, on a Sunday of

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:52.829
legions of ushers taking you to different
bits.

00:16:52.829 --> 00:16:57.019
And it is approached -- and one has to be
rather crude about saying this -- with just

00:16:57.019 --> 00:17:02.019
as relentless a devotion to marketing and
just as relentless a devotion to customer

00:17:02.019 --> 00:17:06.910
segmentation as you'd find in many parts of
any other sort of business.

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:10.350
There are churches for bikers.
There are churches for gays.

00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:14.270
There are churches for dropouts.
There's a "Scum of the Earth Church" in Colorado.

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:21.860
There are Bibles for soldiers, Bibles for
teens, Bibles for tweens, Bibles for people

00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:26.480
in one form of emotional distress, Bibles
for rappers.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:30.850
"Even though I walk through the hood of death,
I don't back down, for you have my back,"

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:34.740
is one selection.
[laughter] You can go to Golgotha Fun Park.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:38.510
And these, as I say, it's not just American
and Christian.

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:43.480
But that is the dominant, I think, gene in
terms of the way the religious market around

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:47.560
the world is being steered.
You can see the same thing in terms of, Islamic

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:51.710
mega-preachers are beginning to pick up the
same habits the Christian ones do.

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:57.330
If you go to Hindu temples in India, you will
actually discover a sort of high-tech efficiency

00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:04.320
of a level I would argue that's even greater
than you see in the rest of religion.

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:08.560
So, to some extent, that's the supply side
of what's happening.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:13.451
The demand side -- I think, a lot of it comes
from the big, economic movement of our time,

00:18:13.451 --> 00:18:17.520
which remains I think globalization.
Globalization creates demand for religion

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:21.100
in two senses.
One is the one, which most critics are only

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:26.000
too keen to point out is, it creates demand
for storm shelter against change.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.990
And I think that is true.
I'm not remotely denying that.

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:33.630
You go to places, you go to Arkansas, but
you can also go to the suburbs of Cairo, and

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:39.260
you can find a lot of people who are clinging
to religion, because they see that as a protection

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:43.060
against the on-rush of the modern -- in some
cases -- very American world.

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:48.640
But at the same time, I think for many, many
more people, it's -- at least the modern versions

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:51.090
of religion are being seen as a way to get
ahead.

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:55.410
I don't think it's any accident that the best-selling
book about religion in America, by miles,

00:18:55.410 --> 00:19:00.950
best-selling book of any sort pretty much
in modern times, is a book called "The Purpose

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:05.210
Driven Life," by Rick Warren.
It's about people looking for meaning.

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:10.110
It's about people who sit there and think
that their life has reached a certain point

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:13.450
that they want some kind of framework to understand
it.

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:19.040
And the reason why -- and again, this is looked
at from outside objectively -- is that man,

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:22.820
whether we like it or not -- and this is really
what we have to confront, particularly people

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:27.110
who just assume that religion was going to
fade away -- was that man is fundamentally

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:31.840
a thixotropic creature.
It's something which man generally will be

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:35.300
brought back to religion.
And it is also -- again, whether we like it

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:38.991
or not -- a rational thing to do, because
religious people -- and again, the numbers

00:19:38.991 --> 00:19:43.090
in America are pretty convincing about this.
Religious people tend to be healthier; they

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:45.140
live longer.
They tend to be wealthier; they're better

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:47.460
off than other people.
And they tend to be wiser.

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:50.930
They tend to be better educated.
And what's interesting about science for the

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:55.170
moment, is while you have one group of scientists
who are going out producing ever-more, elaborate

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:59.940
evidence as to why God didn't exist at all,
and differences, and stuff like black holes

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:03.300
and so on.
You have a whole other bevy of social scientists

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:07.910
who are going out looking at the reasons why
religion actually seems to work or does quite

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:10.680
well.
And you have weird experiments where you put

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:16.340
nuns and Buddhist monks into MRI machines
 -- not at the same time --

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:17.340
&gt;&gt; [Laughter]

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:21.740
John Micklethwait: -- to measure what their
brains are doing when they listen, when they're

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:23.890
praying.
You have people looking at -- vast number

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:29.170
of economists looking at -- why religious
communities seem to work as an organization,

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:33.840
and so on, and so on.
So this, in a sense, is the world in which

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:37.860
I think we now have to live in.
And understanding that world, and suddenly

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:41.800
taking into account that there is a different
sort of form of reality in most of the world,

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:45.420
particularly for people in Western Europe
where things are not going that direction,

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:47.670
I think, is something that we have to deal
with.

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:50.880
Is it a good world?
Well, I'd argue to one extent, from the point

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:56.550
of view of a liberal editing a liberal paper,
it is -- although a bit of a deeply secular

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:59.950
one -- I would say it is a good one, because
it's fundamentally based around choice.

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:04.830
Modernity.
And this, I think, is the big category mistake.

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:09.610
This is the huge mistake which most of the
apostles of secularization made.

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:13.690
They identified modernity with secularism.
And it isn't.

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:17.680
Modernity is really about pluralism.
It's about the ability to sit there and decide

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:21.270
and choose, "I'm going to be this," "I'm going
to be that," or "I'm going to be whatever.”

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:26.670
And that I think is the core liberal thing
to do it.

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:31.280
But if you have a choice -- and this comes
on to the political part of the book -- choice

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:36.200
has consequences.
In some cases, the consequences are good;

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:43.010
in other cases, they're less good.
If you decide, if you look at America, one

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:48.730
out of every four people changes their faith
during their life.

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:55.640
Close to one out of two, if you divide different
forms of Protestantisms into different sorts.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.270
America is a place where people are changing
their religion all the time.

00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:01.280
They're choosing to do things.
They're not necessarily just walking into

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:06.050
the same church their parents did, and starting
from six and going all the way up to 70.

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:10.130
If you start choosing -- as an increasing
number of people are around the world -- what

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:15.240
kind of religion you're going to do, you are,
I would maintain, much less likely to leave

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:20.230
that set of beliefs behind when you enter
the ballot box, whether you go to the workplace,

00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:23.780
whether you go anywhere outside.
It's becoming an act of choice, rather than

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:27.570
one of inheritance.
And that, I think, does have big consequences.

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:32.190
It's plainly good in some cases, in terms
of the effects of what religion can do.

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:37.630
If you go to a town like Philadelphia, for
instance, you see actually if you took away

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:42.060
all the social services that religious people
provide, you'd effectively have to find about

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:47.110
$500 million a year more money from the state
in order to provide things.

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:50.880
One reason why religion has not done so well
in Europe is partly because the state does

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:57.540
do more things than it does in America.
I think the world where -- ____ I think I've

00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:02.560
used in this respect, is it a fair example
 -- the world where religion poisons everything,

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:06.490
I think does not stand up to consequences.
Certainly, I'm one who's wandered around the

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:10.750
world and looked at all the horrors and good
things that religion does.

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:13.850
It's patently obvious that a huge amount of
good work gets done which otherwise would

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:22.450
not be done because of people who are religious.
But there is also equally obviously bad consequences

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:27.730
of the spread of religion.
I think, particularly, this was the area that

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:30.890
Europeans -- unlike the Americans -- were
right to be worried about.

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:34.330
One reason why Europeans turned against religion
is because they associate it with wars of

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:36.770
religion.
I think there are two particular areas which

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:40.760
stand out and which are likely, I think, to
haunt politics for the future.

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:44.150
The first is "wars of religion" and the second
are "culture wars.”

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:50.360
What do I mean by "wars of religion?”
I thought I would read out a speech by Mahmoud

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:57.600
Ahmadinejad to Iran's Parliament quite recently.
He asked, "Who are our enemies, and why do

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:01.660
they hate us?”
And his answer was that Iran faced an axis

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:06.060
of evil with its enemies being, I quote, "All
the wicked men of the world, whether abroad

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:08.710
or at home.
And the root cause of their hatred," he told

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:13.480
the Iranians, "was their loathing.
The root cause of the opponent's hatred was

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:16.610
a loathing of whomsoever should serve the
glory of God.”

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:21.420
And he goes through all George Bush's atrocities.
And then he tells the cheering MPs, "Truly,

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:25.400
your great enemy is the American.
Through that enmity that is in him against

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.970
all that is of God in you.
Fortunately," he said, "Iran wouldn't fight

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:31.311
alone.”
It had the support of Muslims around the world.

00:24:31.311 --> 00:24:35.500
"Be bold," he advised, "and you will find
that you act for a very great many people

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:39.060
that are God's own.”
Now, the interesting thing about that speech

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:44.280
was, it wasn't actually given by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
It was given by Oliver Cromwell in 1656.

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:47.900
And he was reaching out to English Puritans,
rather than Iranian Muslims.

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:52.290
In that case, the Great Satan was not George
Bush, but Catholic Spain.

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:56.871
That was the time of the 30 Years War Retirement,
incidentally, when more people died in that

00:24:56.871 --> 00:25:00.170
religious conflict than they did in the Great
Plague.

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:04.620
I think now, if you are going to be worried
about what religion could do to the world,

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:07.011
I think there are similar worries to some
extent.

00:25:07.011 --> 00:25:12.090
The most obvious one is, you have to look
at the big conflicts that could rip apart

00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:15.650
our world.
I think you could say three out of the four

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:18.760
are actually -- got a very, very strong religious
component.

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:28.420
And those four, I would say, were Israel/Palestine,
India/Pakistan, America/Iran, and North Korea.

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:32.520
Only North Korea, I think, strikes me as a
totally secular one.

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:37.570
If you look at terrorism, once again, we're
living in a world which Cromwell, I think,

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:40.310
would have found distinctly worrying and indeed
familiar.

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:44.130
One of the most interesting things to me is,
if you look at that videotape of Mohammad

00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:50.830
Sidique Khan talking about prior to going
off to go bomb on 7-7, the parallels between

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:57.360
that and Guy Fawkes back in 1604 are actually
terrifying even down to the fact they both

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:05.780
speak in the same Yorkshire accent.
One of them is the fact -- it's the essence

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:11.130
of the man who went overseas to get even more
radicalized than he was when he left and then

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:14.670
came back with the aim of committing a huge
act of terrorism.

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:19.040
At the same time, other cynics would point
out that the other problem we have, which

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:23.960
is the same as Cromwell, is we have a great
religion and schism or in crisis.

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:29.030
We have the split between Sunni and Shia in
Islam, and we have the ramifications of that

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:33.270
just as we have the ramifications of Christianity
back in the 16th century.

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:37.000
I would still say it's not remotely as bad
as that, because we no longer have leaders

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.130
who are pulling us towards this.
It tends to be much more a bottom-up dispute.

00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:46.840
It tends to be much more an issue of people
coming from down below pushing things up,

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:51.850
whereas back then, you had a question of princes
actually leading people into army under religious

00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:56.290
banners.
But, what is clear and what is identical is

00:26:56.290 --> 00:27:03.360
that once you get religion into a dispute,
it is much, much harder to solve.

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:06.660
If you want a perfect example of that, look
at Israel/Palestine.

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:11.250
You go back to the beginning of the Israeli/Palestinian
dispute, you have Israel set up by pretty

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:15.881
secular Jews, particularly David Ben-Gurion
who gave the sort of religious lot something

00:27:15.881 --> 00:27:21.410
to hang onto, but basically the tone of the
original Israel was very secular.

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:26.840
The Palestine Liberation Organization for
a long time was headed or led by Christians

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:31.810
in fairly prominent positions.
Now, you have two sides who are at their most

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:34.280
radical.
Both believe that God gave them a particular

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:38.380
area of the world, and that makes compromise
much, much more difficult.

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:40.141
And the same, I think, applies to culture
wars.

00:27:40.141 --> 00:27:43.580
Most places have managed to reach a sort of
fuzzy compromise.

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:48.410
They have issues like abortion.
If you believe either that abortion is murder

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:52.630
 -- or for that matter, on the other side,
I suppose if you believe it is a fundamental

00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:57.110
right of every single person -- it's much,
much more difficult to compromise.

00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:00.890
And that brings me to the second sort of wars
which I think are coming up which are these

00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:03.760
culture wars.
I think exactly the same thing that we saw

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:08.600
in America is going to some extent come here.
I don't necessarily mean abortion, but I do

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:14.030
think technology is pushing us towards issues
like stem cells, like cloning, which are going

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:18.410
to have an effect in Europe.
I think also we see the growth of Islam here

00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:22.740
is causing many of the same arguments that
we thought have been dispatched two centuries

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:27.890
ago to rearrange.
What exactly is the role of particular services?

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:30.260
Do people need different forms of justice
systems?

00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:33.510
You have the issue of sharia.
You have the issue of whether the country

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:36.950
can tell you what to wear through head scarves,
and so on.

00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:41.880
And again, I think, what's interesting about
this is that it has crept up on us.

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:46.081
Because, even in America, what is interesting
is, the politicians who have to deal with

00:28:46.081 --> 00:28:52.100
this, even bizarrely, quite religious politicians
themselves, never actually really saw this

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:56.350
element of foreign policy coming up.
Religion was a bit of foreign policy that

00:28:56.350 --> 00:29:01.230
everybody ignored, that nobody really saw.
There's a wonderful Madeline Albright anecdote

00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:06.200
about a Clinton cabinet meeting where one
of them suddenly says, "Isn't it amazing.

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:09.260
It's incredible.
It's the end of the 20th century, and we're

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:12.130
still discussing a religious dispute in Northern
Ireland.”

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:17.529
And the general assumption is this was the
last possible version of this before finally

00:29:17.529 --> 00:29:24.250
that episode of diplomacy was thrown away.
That was only two years before September 11th.

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:27.980
I think what's interesting to me is that,
if you look at those two issues.

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:31.871
One, the culture wars at home.
Secondly, these possible wars of religion

00:29:31.871 --> 00:29:35.550
between places.
I think both, to some extent, lead back to

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:38.470
America.
They lead back to America, because first,

00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:44.400
in terms of foreign policy, I think it is
America which is the one which has to do most.

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:51.030
I think, fundamentally, you are never going
to have a settlement of the sort of disputes,

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:54.600
which I mentioned earlier, if you don't involve
religious people in it.

00:29:54.600 --> 00:30:00.140
If you look at Northern Ireland, what's interesting
is, they actually did bring priests and vicars

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.850
into the discussion.
What happened on British television -- for

00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:07.930
those of you old enough to remember -- was,
whenever any atrocity happened, you saw both

00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:13.220
a Catholic priest and a Protestant rector
condemning the same atrocity regardless of

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:16.860
which side it was.
You go to Jerusalem, you do not see that.

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:23.090
You don't see when Israeli bombs fall on Palestinians,
you don't see rabbis standing alongside mullahs

00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:25.530
to condemn it.
And when suicide bombers coming the other

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:28.050
way, you don't see the same thing in the other
direction.

00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:33.780
Until that happens, I think people will find
it very difficult to start to resolve these

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:37.690
sort of debates.
And it strikes me that again and again and

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:41.720
again people have not thought of the religious
connotation within it.

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:46.980
One of the great ironies of George Bush in
Iraq was, you had one of the most God-Squadding

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:50.670
presidencies ever.
And yet, they fundamentally sent people into

00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:54.740
Iraq without really understanding the difference
between Sunnis and Shias.

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:58.470
There is an element of diplomacy which repeatedly
 -- and that in America somewhat quite honorably

00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:03.370
wants to push this to one side, but it is
actually a cohesive and big part of modern

00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:07.900
politics, I think.
In terms of the divisions at home, in terms

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:11.460
of those culture wars, I think there actually
America is much more useful as an example

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:14.880
to us in Britain.
I think the fundamental division between church

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:19.630
and state in America is incredibly healthy,
and it's something that we should have much

00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:21.120
firmer here.
I think U.S.

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:25.660
was right, that what is good for religion
 -- in the sense of that split between church

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:30.520
and state -- would be also good for here.
I think the Church of England has nothing

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:36.800
to lose at all by giving up the establishment
cause.

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:40.230
So it is, from my perspective, sort of a difficult
world out there.

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:45.190
I thought at the end, as I said, I would employ
a second cheap trick, which I didn't do at

00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:47.559
the beginning.
The second cheap trick is, If you want to

00:31:47.559 --> 00:31:52.309
think about the world we're heading towards.
My second cheap trick is to bring in Barack

00:31:52.309 --> 00:31:56.640
Obama -- which is the other refuge of every
politician in trouble at the moment, beyond

00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:01.330
saying they want to start a conversation.
I think if you want to think about what sort

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:05.680
of religion is the sort of religion which
I think he's going to spread pretty quickly

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:12.360
 -- not as much in Europe as it does in America
 -- but still with a potency here.

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:17.630
I think, when you think of American Christianity,
you are much, much better thinking of Barack

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:21.820
Obama than you are of George Bush.
Because people, I think, when they had that

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:25.850
idea of American religiosity, they tend to
think of a man who had deep troubles with

00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:32.920
drink, and then turned to sort of a vengeful,
difficult, hard executioning version of Texan

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:38.520
religion, and that was what motivated him.
I think actually the Obama story, which is

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:44.470
one of the clever, recently successful, young
 -- I forgot what the word is -- metropolitan,

00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:51.950
metrosexual, person in Chicago, who thought
that his life was okay but lacking a certain

00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:54.120
something.
It lacked a certain sort of meaning, and he

00:32:54.120 --> 00:33:01.240
found that in a Chicago church.
That strikes me as a much more plausible,

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:06.160
likely version, of why religion might indeed
grow again in Europe.

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:13.740
Because I don't think believe, to that extent,
that the suburbs of Paris are that different

00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:18.510
really to the same suburbs where Obama found
that particular experience.

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:22.470
Anyway, I've employed both my cheap tricks
and talked for just over half an hour, which

00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:26.360
is longer than I said.
So I will now open it up to questions.

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:27.360
Thank you.

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:30.100
&gt;&gt; [Clapping] [inaudible]

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:53.910
Q Why do you think that Europe, and certainly
Britain and France, the Nordics, are much

00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:57.370
less religious than the rest of the world?

00:33:57.370 --> 00:34:01.230
John Micklethwait: I do generally -- I don't
want to sound like a free market fundamentalist

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:06.260
 -- but I do think it a lot of it had to do
with that basic idea there is an established

00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:09.429
church.
There is one -- if you sit and read Trollop,

00:34:09.429 --> 00:34:15.740
and you just see a church which was obsessed
by trying to climb up the different levels.

00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:19.570
You know, if you were the vicar of Barchester,
it didn't matter how many people you got in

00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:22.830
through the door, that wasn't even remotely
part of your -- all that mattered was you

00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:26.570
got on with the deacon of Barchester.
And the same, I think, is true of quite a

00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:30.860
lot of the Catholic countries.
It's obviously not just that, because you

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:37.350
could argue there's been a more competitive
market in most European countries since the

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:41.520
beginning of this century.
But I think, by then, the share level to which

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:49.389
religion had been taken out of many of the
areas of kind of competitive society, I think

00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:51.659
that did make a difference.
I mean, I think that's the main thing.

00:34:51.659 --> 00:34:54.290
It's not the only thing.
You could argue that in general, the general

00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:59.270
culture of Europe is now so kind of completely
unreligious, that it's actually quite difficult

00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:03.620
for anything to take flower.
But what's interesting is that actually -- there

00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:07.970
are bits -- I mean if you go to France, Pentacostalism
is the fastest growing religion.

00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:11.040
Like, I don't know the exact statistics.
But from a very small base.

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:18.390
Two million Britons have been on the Alpha
Course, which makes me think -- which is the

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:22.230
one where you see, Is there a meaning to life?
 -- and which seems the Alpha Course is sort

00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:25.850
of like a kind of Purpose Driven Life for
English people, I suppose is a way of describing

00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:29.440
it.
That seems to indicate to me something is

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:31.601
going on.
And if you are very optimistic, from a religious

00:35:31.601 --> 00:35:36.290
point of view, you actually look at things
like adult confirmations.

00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:43.520
So childhood confirmations have gone down.
Adult confirmations in the Church of England

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:46.190
have gone up.
And you can also look at odd things like pilgrimages.

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:53.850
These are all straws in the wind.
I would personally expect religion in Europe

00:35:53.850 --> 00:36:00.030
to go down a bit.
But then, what I describe is the Obama effect

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:04.470
beginning to work -- that people will start
looking for bits of identity and meaning.

00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:10.260
The interesting thing to me is that, we don't
make any claim in this book that religion

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:12.830
like that is going to come back in Europe
immediately.

00:36:12.830 --> 00:36:19.119
What is interesting is, over the past decade,
I think religion has come back into European

00:36:19.119 --> 00:36:23.210
politics in a way that people utterly assumed
it would go away.

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:25.980
The famous Blair quote about, "I don't do
God.”

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:30.520
Or, no, it wasn't Blair, it was Campbell.
"We don't do God on this side of the Atlantic.”

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:33.630
I think that's changed.
Blair himself spends nothing else other than

00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:37.540
doing God at the moment.
I think you have Brown, you have -- Sarkozy's

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:40.810
written about religion.
You see the introductions on the East European

00:36:40.810 --> 00:36:47.330
ones -- the somewhat crazy Polish brothers
being a good example -- into European politics.

00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:52.420
And above all, actually, you see Islam.
Islam is -- I don't buy any of those sort

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:59.940
of Eurabia theories from the neocons -- but
the basic idea is, Islam is posing questions,

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:04.370
putting questions, back into European politics
which people thought had gone.

00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:09.090
So for all those reasons, if you were to again
look at ________ articles about politics and

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:12.980
religion ten years ago, and you look at them
now, there's much more stuff going on.

00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:17.010
So religion coming back into Europe will take
time.

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:23.440
Religious politics is already there, I think.

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:25.080
[pause]

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:33.920
Q Hi.
You

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:36.220
mentioned the link between foreign policy
and religion.

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:43.140
And the Chinese increasingly becoming confluence
of religions events, from Xinjiang in the

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:48.390
East all the way through to Burma and Nepal.
How do you think this will shape China's foreign

00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:49.390
policy?

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:55.780
John Micklethwait: I wouldn't agree.
There was some American conservative meeting

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:58.940
the other night in London where people seemed
to think this was a great hope for China.

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:04.020
I think that would be going too far.
What interests me -- or rather the reason

00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:07.320
why it was on my mind was because there was
a well-known American conservative thinker

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:12.530
I came across here.
One of his arguments was that the more -- because

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:18.080
the right wing Americans suddenly got onto
this idea that Christianity is a big thing

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:22.050
in China in a way that Europeans haven't.
Not least because they pour so much money

00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:25.350
in there.
The theory he was adopting was, the more Christian

00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:30.990
they became, the less sort of bellicose China
would get, which struck me as unlikely, to

00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:35.580
the extent that, when you talk to people like
Wang, one of his reasons why he wants China

00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:40.660
to adopt Christianity or more Christianity,
he said that China can be even stronger.

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:47.720
He thinks that Christianity was key to America's
success, so therefore make China ever more

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:50.860
powerful.
I think it must make a difference in the following

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:53.780
sense that, if you suddenly have groups of
Christians gathered around places, you've

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:58.619
also got -- it must make some difference to
bits of the foreign policy.

00:38:58.619 --> 00:39:01.290
How much I don't know.
I still think that foreign policy tends to

00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:05.380
be, nowadays, more driven by nationalism than
it is by religion.

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:10.810
But within China, it could make a big difference.
I didn't talk about it, but I think China

00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:14.730
will certainly become the world's biggest
Christian country really, quite quickly.

00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:19.710
I think most people reckon it will also become
the world's biggest Muslim country relatively

00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:22.619
quickly, because Islam is also doing quite
well there.

00:39:22.619 --> 00:39:25.170
So that's another source of joyful conflict.

00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:26.170
[pause]

00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:36.950
Q Hi. I had two questions.
One was to elaborate on your statement about

00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:46.870
the wealthy or the educated comprising a lot
of religious people.

00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:51.232
Did you mean in terms of the percentage of
people who are wealthy or educated whereas

00:39:51.232 --> 00:39:52.232
poor or uneducated, or actually in numbers?

00:39:52.232 --> 00:39:56.020
John Micklethwait: In terms of -- the stuff
to do in terms of Turkey and India was just

00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:59.450
sort of anecdotal.
If you look at the people, it's the bureaucratic

00:39:59.450 --> 00:40:07.230
bourgeoisie who are moving toward those papers.
In America, my memory is it's both.

00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:13.320
If you look at the people who claim to be
evangelicals, they tend to be better educated

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:16.210
than the norm.
If you take a certain norm from American education,

00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:20.050
more of them have a college education.
More of them have Ph.D.s, and all that type

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:25.900
of stuff.
I still think within America there is an element

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:33.040
of -- there is one way in which you can query
that figure -- I don't think I'll get too

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:36.890
technical on that.
Basically some of the very conservative, religious

00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:40.840
colleges aren't necessarily of the same caliber
as the other ones.

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:45.530
But still, I think, I'll be honest to say,
I've seen a tiny bit in the reception to this

00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:49.580
book amongst evangelicals.
Basic American evangelicals are not always

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:53.940
pleased by -- the degree of deliberative criticism
is not always something they terribly like.

00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:58.830
Q Do you think it's the same in Islam?

00:40:58.830 --> 00:41:00.860
John Micklethwait: Islam, I think the numbers
are more questionable.

00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:07.340
Turkey, there's no doubt that what, exactly
the people, you talk to the army people and

00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:12.360
the secular heirs of Ataturk.
They are horrified by the idea that exactly

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:21.460
the people they wanted to be profoundly secular
and to steer Turkey away from Ataturk was

00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:28.380
very rude about all forms of religious clothing.
Ataturk would have had a nightmare seeing

00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:35.210
the leader -- one of his heirs -- standing,
welcoming Obama with his wife wearing a headscarf.

00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:37.869
All that stuff was exactly what they didn't
want.

00:41:37.869 --> 00:41:40.440
I think in the rest of the Muslim world, it's
more generic.

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:49.630
In Indonesia, there's some evidence that there's
a sort of clever young move back towards it.

00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:53.640
Islam is much more difficult to get any kind
of decent polling numbers, because people

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:57.580
are extremely reluctant to say they don't
believe in God.

00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:01.000
And I should add, that's true of pretty much
all statistics dealing with religion.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.690
So I try to take it in broad brushes rather
than claiming particular bits.

00:42:04.690 --> 00:42:10.210
Q One last question was about corruption.
Do you have any observations on corruption

00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:11.210
and religion?

00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:16.619
John Micklethwait: Well, I suppose, yeah.
I do have one observation which has to do

00:42:16.619 --> 00:42:21.650
with foreign policies.
I think, I am personally always keen on religious,

00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:25.680
particularly religious parties, getting -- I'm
not saying I'm keen on saying religious parties

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:29.590
getting into power, it could be misinterpreted
 -- but an advantage of religious parties

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:34.590
getting into party and I think a lesson for
the West is, if you have a party like the

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:38.140
AK party, let them get into power.
They should have done the same in Algeria.

00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:42.781
Whenever you let a religious party come in
 -- and you could argue this is probably true

00:42:42.781 --> 00:42:49.600
also of things like with the Muslim Brotherhood
in Egypt -- it's true of arguably of Hamas

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:54.180
in Palestine.
If you let these people get power, they end

00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:58.800
up being more like other politicians than
they certainly ever intended to be.

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:02.359
They have to cut deals.
They do -- things like corruption increase.

00:43:02.359 --> 00:43:07.390
To some extent, that special degree of moral
superiority, which religious parties can bring

00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:11.609
only when they're in opposition.
For the moment, Egypt would be a classic example.

00:43:11.609 --> 00:43:15.940
You have the deeply corrupt and not altogether
pleasant Barack regime.

00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:20.380
You have the Muslim Brotherhood, which has
some pretty weird ideas, but basically if

00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:25.890
you're going to meet them, they do evince
a type of honesty and straightforwardness

00:43:25.890 --> 00:43:32.400
which you don't always get from the regime.
______ The Egyptians won't in any way allow

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:35.700
the Muslim Brotherhood to do anything.
The Americans are paranoid about it, because

00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:41.380
they sort of see senses a cousin of his brother
in Hamas actually letting them into power.

00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:45.369
I think the more power they have, the more
people will begin to see how realistic it

00:43:45.369 --> 00:43:48.270
is.
Ahmadinejad's another example of somebody

00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:55.430
who claimed to be a religious zealot, but
actually remains there, because he stuffed

00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:57.510
ballot boxes.

00:43:57.510 --> 00:44:03.520
Q There is talk that the _________ works of
which Dawkins and Sam Harris and everybody

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:08.860
who think along those lines are actually doing
the cause of secularism damage, because it's

00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:10.900
drawing people towards religion.
I just wondered if you wanted to comment on

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:11.900
that?

00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:16.790
John Micklethwait: I think Dawkins is interesting.
Any time I talk to Dawkins about it, he's

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:24.860
obsessed by the big, scientific pictures.
But actually, he's -- the idea that the sort

00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:26.340
of facts.
I said to him, "Look, it's actually interesting.

00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:28.190
Religion seems to be doing very well despite
you.”

00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:32.020
[laughter] He didn't seem too obsessed by
that.

00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:37.700
I think Hitchens is probably more angry about
it than Sam Harris is.

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:42.850
There is an element whereby what always tends
to happen is, once one side exaggerates its

00:44:42.850 --> 00:44:45.180
case.
Particularly American politics -- the recent

00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:49.369
history of American politics -- has been one
of overreach by one side followed by the other.

00:44:49.369 --> 00:44:56.480
You have the 60's, with a profound, liberal,
idiotic term for them, but you have a "leftish"

00:44:56.480 --> 00:45:01.160
overreach in the 60's followed by 30, 40 years
of conservatives.

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:05.650
You could argue, with Bush, you then have
a pretty big overreach by the right.

00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:09.420
And then, it's now balancing again.
So I would expect something.

00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:24.070
Q I have a question about your positive evaluation
of phenomenon and justifying it because people

00:45:24.070 --> 00:45:29.810
obviously have more choice.
And I would just say the negative aspect of

00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:35.380
it is that, not only there's a choice in what
I spiritually choose to believe, but also

00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:42.740
it presents itself as it creeps into the daily
life by, for example, that creationism presents

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:49.650
itself as a choice and alternative to evolution.
And I would argue thus that the tapestry of

00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:55.440
different religions that you have and you
can choose between them, somehow also leads

00:45:55.440 --> 00:46:04.570
us to believe that basically scientific facts
are being disregarded for the sake of pluralism.

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:14.000
Hence I would still argue in favor of modernity
being understood as secularism in terms of

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.480
that religion simply is often challenged by
science and that scientific arguments are

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:24.240
not being taken enough into account by religious
people.

00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:27.510
John Micklethwait: I think that's a choice
you have to make.

00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:31.330
For my book, pluralism is the greater good
out of those two.

00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:37.600
There will be some elements of creationism.
They tend to get pushed back.

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:41.700
You could argue it's worse you say from some
perspectives.

00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:44.250
A, you've got the antiscientific lot.
You've also got, as I said earlier -- one

00:46:44.250 --> 00:46:50.600
interesting thing about the free market is,
it seems to encourage people with very strong

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:52.130
brands.
I mean, the Pentecostals are probably the

00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:55.950
least scientific out of all the Christian
ones, and they're the ones who are doing best.

00:46:55.950 --> 00:47:02.910
So there is that risk.
That I'm either -- the one religion that I'm

00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:05.681
fundamentalist on the market, but I think
that you have to open up.

00:47:05.681 --> 00:47:07.661
But then, I think it's the fundamentally liberal
thing to do.

00:47:07.661 --> 00:47:12.410
You give people the chance to understand how
it works.

00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:18.160
For me, there's no better thing to lose faith
in Creationism than to visit, I think it's

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:22.720
the Creation Museum in Kentucky, where very
nice people try to explain to you -- and they're

00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:26.359
extremely earnest, and some of them even have
rather strange doctrines.

00:47:26.359 --> 00:47:31.099
But try to explain to you how, because they
have cram the whole of human history into

00:47:31.099 --> 00:47:35.290
2000 years -- you literally go from Adam and
Eve.

00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:40.120
And so, like 53 years later, there's dinosaurs
running around really quickly, 'cause I know

00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:42.460
those existed.
And then, suddenly we're into Abraham.

00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:49.450
And it's patently wrong, and I think anyone
who goes to see it, gets that quite quickly.

00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:56.490
Just intellectually, I'm inherently -- I'm
on the, "I feel lucky" part of the thing.

00:47:56.490 --> 00:48:01.550
Sorry, Peter, yeah.

00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:04.930
Q [inaudible]

00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:15.730
John Micklethwait: Google as a religion is
interesting.

00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:21.340
I think technology is part of the -- what's
interesting about these people -- what's interesting

00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:25.900
about religious people is that, I mean, at
one point we thought about putting this, but

00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:29.480
it became difficult to maintain.
You could argue two of the earliest of doctors

00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:36.830
of any technology tended to be pornographers.
Churches are remarkably quick in terms of

00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:41.910
the way they grab new forms of technology
and push it.

00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:48.240
Amongst -- certainly amongst the American
 -- if the American Christian thing is the

00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:52.450
general dynamic, those are about as protechnology
as it's possible to be.

00:48:52.450 --> 00:48:55.359
They're endlessly looking at new ways in order
to get things through.

00:48:55.359 --> 00:49:01.350
They're very, very quick on to things like
_________ all those things.

00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:04.440
So it's pretty technophile.
Against that, you're right.

00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:09.410
There are some elements which are inherently
suspicious of it.

00:49:09.410 --> 00:49:13.760
The bit where they get into trouble has more
to do with biology than information technology,

00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:16.190
I think.
It's quite interesting actually, but in Africa,

00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:21.359
you can argue out of all the dominant religions
there -- and religions grow very quickly in

00:49:21.359 --> 00:49:27.109
Africa -- the only religion that now accepts
evolution, the big one is Catholicism, which

00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:41.119
is an interesting switch from where it was
around the time of Galileo.

00:49:41.119 --> 00:49:42.119
[pause]

00:49:42.119 --> 00:49:44.359
Q I was just wondering.
In all the different religious meetings that

00:49:44.359 --> 00:49:49.099
you've kind of visited through your research
for the book, what was one experience that

00:49:49.099 --> 00:49:51.651
really affected you or kind of stayed with
you?

00:49:51.651 --> 00:49:58.349
John Micklethwait: There's two.
I think the exorcism in Brazil was fairly

00:49:58.349 --> 00:50:03.970
nonBrazilian -- was a fairly extraordinary
experience.

00:50:03.970 --> 00:50:11.020
You go to a sort of normal middleclass -- kind
of middle to working class -- suburb of Sao

00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:14.401
Paolo.
You sit there in one of those large churches

00:50:14.401 --> 00:50:18.310
that don't have much of an altar.
And then, you think you imagine you got the

00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:22.330
wrong time, because there's three exorcisms
a week and it's -- I think it was -- three

00:50:22.330 --> 00:50:26.740
o'clock on Wednesday.
I compounded the error by having -- we had

00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:33.150
a meeting of all the Latin American correspondents
of The Economist in Sao Paolo that day, and

00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:36.599
it ended at lunchtime.
And I foolishly said I was going off to an

00:50:36.599 --> 00:50:38.950
exorcism afterwards.
And that sort of, two of them and their girlfriends

00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:41.800
said they want to come too.
And you sort of arrive -- It's a bit like

00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:44.750
a sort of bad house party arrives in the middle
of this church and you're sitting there in

00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:48.840
this large place, and everyone's filing in.
And then, a huge number of housewives come

00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:53.130
in with their shopping, children -- you get
the general impression they just dropped off

00:50:53.130 --> 00:50:55.330
their laundry, they're picking up their children
from school.

00:50:55.330 --> 00:50:58.270
And again, everyone's just sort of sitting
around quite normally.

00:50:58.270 --> 00:51:05.609
And then, by within the next barely takes
an hour they're reduced to these quivering

00:51:05.609 --> 00:51:11.480
wrecks where you see the same woman who just
walked in beside you with her children is

00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:14.831
lying on the floor with people cursing spirits
out of them.

00:51:14.831 --> 00:51:19.190
It's a very strong thing -- exorcism -- in
Brazil, because a of people -- a lot of families

00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:26.960
who originally came from Africa to some extent
believe that when they left Africa, old tribal

00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:33.060
religions cursed them for the fact that they
were being stripped away as slaves to Brazil.

00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:38.180
And you see this thing where people are reduced
to this strange shape.

00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:42.380
And then what happened, almost the strange
thing were the children sit there play around

00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:47.220
in the back, watch their mothers descend to
the floor in this kind of profound emotional

00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:53.420
state, and then when the guy brings them back
out of it again, everyone picks up their shopping,

00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:59.599
the children all go running around to gather
around their mothers and walk out again.

00:51:59.599 --> 00:52:04.980
That extreme of emotion within an hour.
And the odd thing was talking to the pastor

00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:08.070
who did it.
Was sort of -- It's almost like talking to

00:52:08.070 --> 00:52:12.690
sort of like a surgeon after an operation.
Well, today was quite good.

00:52:12.690 --> 00:52:16.320
Five women I think we solved.
It was very kind of it's almost like he's

00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:21.070
sitting there making a cigarette.
That was profound.

00:52:21.070 --> 00:52:26.400
I also thought that on the less -- other side
of it -- you got a place like Nigeria.

00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:31.020
You actually see the religious war is most
intense.

00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:37.930
You see Christians, funded by American collection
plate money pushing northwards.

00:52:37.930 --> 00:52:42.300
And you see Islam funded by Saudi petrol dollars
coming southwards.

00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:46.680
And you just see this smashing together.
And you can go to a place then, a couple of

00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:50.560
weeks later, there's a fairly, large-size
massacre.

00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:53.960
So there's two.

00:52:53.960 --> 00:53:00.700
Q So you talked a lot about the rise of mainstream
religion, and I just wanted to see if you

00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:07.950
had any thoughts on the phenomenon behind
like, rising affiliation to sects.

00:53:07.950 --> 00:53:17.570
So like, maybe scientology, which has been
a huge uptake in the past few years, and I'm

00:53:17.570 --> 00:53:20.660
sure there are quite a few big ones?

00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:26.270
John Micklethwait: Well, the truth is, some
of them are sects to the extent that they

00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:28.650
drag you in and they never really allow you
out.

00:53:28.650 --> 00:53:34.060
I didn't really go into Scientology in perhaps
the level it deserves, not least because they

00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:40.640
seem to be the most litigious group of religious
people in the history of the world.

00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:45.330
I think what you really -- I mean what de
Tocqueville said when he went to America was,

00:53:45.330 --> 00:53:49.820
he said the reason why America does so well
is multiplicity of sects.

00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:54.930
This is because what happened at the time
Methodism seems like a sect.

00:53:54.930 --> 00:54:00.109
It's the ability without trying desperately
to drag you back to your homeland.

00:54:00.109 --> 00:54:06.330
It's the Silicon Valley aspect of American
religion, which you see totally being mimicked

00:54:06.330 --> 00:54:11.770
in Asia, in Africa, and in Latin America,
actually, to a large extent, whereby people

00:54:11.770 --> 00:54:13.751
come and they set up.
And you can say a bit of East London's East

00:54:13.751 --> 00:54:18.340
End as well.
People come, people join one church, and then

00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:21.420
they don't really like this bit and so they'd
start a new one.

00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:26.000
And if you want a figure who, to me, sort
of symbolizes that form of modern religion

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:30.460
more than anyone else is Thomas Jefferson,
who -- Jefferson went through the Bible and

00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:37.119
cut out all the bits he did like and the bits
he didn't and threw out all the others away.

00:54:37.119 --> 00:54:40.790
And that was sort of his version of religion.
Well, I'll take this, this, this, this.

00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:47.700
And that tends to be how most new sects develop.
The established religions have generally done

00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:49.160
quite badly.
It's the newer ones which have kept pushing

00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:50.160
forward.

00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:51.210
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:54:51.210 --> 00:54:55.010
John Micklethwait: Thank you.

00:54:55.010 --> 00:54:55.950
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]
