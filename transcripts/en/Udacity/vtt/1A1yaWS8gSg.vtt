Maybe somewhat surprisingly, the left model that of Ptolemy has so many knobs to turn

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that it allows more flexible calibration and that it even allows

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
more accurate prediction of the apparent motion.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Footnote--in a modern perspective, this stack of epicycles actually is a Fourier series.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Historically, it turned out that circles around the sun are not good enough.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Kepler noticed that you have to use ellipses to make this really work and then we get a high accuracy.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The lesson to be learned from that is you may want to replace a sophisticated model

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
with accurate predictions by a far simpler model, less accurate predictions,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
just for the sake of understanding.

00:00:42.000 --> 99:59:59.000
This is Occam's Razor in action, trying to find the most simple explanation that does the job.
