Normally, we'd think of using water to put
out a fire, but in this video, you'll learn

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.380
how to use water water to start them.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.949
If you're ever lost in a survival situation,
here's a little trick you're gonna be so

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:39.079
glad to know. To practice this technique we'll
use 3 sheets of paper, and a water bottle.

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.239
A paper with black ink is easy to practice
with, so let's get started making this top

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.219
sheet into a platform by folding it in half
3 different ways. The black ink is showing,

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.039
and that's a good thing, so now we can prepare
these other 2 sheets by cutting or ripping

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.269
them in half. This gives us 4 pieces, and
we can fold each of them in half so that they're

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:00.190
creased down the middle. Alright, time for
the action. We'll need to remove the label

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.820
from this little bottle and use the convex
edge as a makeshift magnifying glass to focus

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.390
the sunlight. It only takes a few seconds
to get this paper smoking, and pretty soon

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.170
we've got it smoldering. When the hole is
about the size of a quarter, we'll need to

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.659
slowly add multiple layers of papers. Swinging
it around gently will help the air get to

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.560
the embers, and when they get hot enough .. a
flame appears! That's it in a nutshell, but

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.189
in practice you'll probably find that it's
not quite as easy as it looks. So here are

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.579
a few tips and tricks to help you master your
technique . First of all, use a bottle with

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:35.450
clear plastic and remove the label. The top
should be smooth and rounded so that it magnifies

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.500
the image on the other side. I've been successful
with colored bottles like this green 2 liter

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.100
and this little blue 8oz bottle, but the color
absorbs some of the suns energy and makes

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.280
it a lot more difficult to get a coal. The
color of the liquid also needs to be as clear

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.119
as possible, but in desperate situations,
it is possible to light a fire with your pee.

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.439
Look for how to do that in a different project.
If you're using paper for tinder, use something

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.619
with big black letters or pictures, or rub
some dirt on it because the black absorbs

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.990
the heat. Trying to do this on a white piece
of paper is just going to frustrate you. When

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.510
focusing the light, hold the bottle close
to the paper and slowly back it away, shifting

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.620
the bottle around to find the area where the
majority of light is concentrated. It should

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.099
be very bright, and start smoking within a
few seconds. Keep the light focused until

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.690
a hole begins to burn, and grows to the size
of a quarter. At this point, you can gently

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.310
set the embers in the creased part of another
paper, and hold it loosely at the corner.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.340
Tight enough so that the embers are in contact,
but loose enough to allow plenty of air to

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.170
flow. When the embers have burned a hole through
the sheet, add another one in the same way,

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.730
pinching the corner and holding loosely. As
the heat builds, and the process is repeated

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.030
2 more times, you should have a billowing
bundle of smoke. It's at this point you can

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.080
blow forcefully into the embers, and voila
.. a healthy flame. This is a technique that

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.670
I've had the most success with. It should
work for you, but might take a little practice.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.319
If you try this at home, you may be surprised
to learn that you can rub the ashes into your

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:04.330
lawn. The potassium, phosphorus and calcium
in the ashes make great lawn fertilizer, so

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.489
long as it's in small quantities. For another
challenge, try this with water and a plastic

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.909
sandwich bag. I found those can work as well!
Well now you know how to start a fire with

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:17.170
your water bottle. If you liked this project,
perhaps you'll like some of my others. Check
