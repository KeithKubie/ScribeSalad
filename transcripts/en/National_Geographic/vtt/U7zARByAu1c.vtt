[forest noises]

00:00:12.967 --> 00:00:15.633
NARRATOR: In rainforests
across the equator,

00:00:15.633 --> 00:00:17.967
most frogs lay their
eggs and abandon them.

00:00:23.433 --> 00:00:28.400
But one determined frog
stands by his young,

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.866
the reticulated glass frog.

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:34.233
It's named for its
transparent skin.

00:00:38.834 --> 00:00:42.667
His organs hard at work,
he's got nothing to hide.

00:00:50.767 --> 00:00:54.000
Mom is nowhere to be found.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Dad alone guards the clutch 24/7
until the eggs become tadpoles.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.033
Sometimes this means
defending his brood

00:01:04.033 --> 00:01:05.132
from their worst enemy.

00:01:11.367 --> 00:01:14.700
Squadrons of carnivorous
rainforest wasps

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.367
take to the air, a
deadly threat for a frog.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:30.032
They're aggressive, persistent,
venomous, and nearly as big

00:01:30.033 --> 00:01:31.200
as the glass frog himself.

00:01:35.767 --> 00:01:39.433
They're not interested in him.

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:42.967
They want his eggs.

00:01:42.967 --> 00:01:46.500
But dad is not willing to
give them up without a fight.

00:01:52.467 --> 00:01:53.834
He was built for this.

00:01:53.834 --> 00:01:56.467
