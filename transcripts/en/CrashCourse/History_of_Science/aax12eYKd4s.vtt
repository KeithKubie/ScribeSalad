00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.720
By the end of World War Two and the beginning
of the Cold War, physics had been revolutionized—again.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.519
Much as Newton had done in 1666, Einstein
did in 1905.

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.480
But once again, biology was late to the paradigm-shifting
party.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.349
Remember how Darwin and Mendel lived around
the same time, but everyone forgot about Mendel

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:29.070
until 1900, and even then biologists saw Darwinism
and Mendelism as two competing grand theories

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.150
about how life works?

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.700
The Darwin and Wallace people thought traits
were blended, and they studied big populations

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.570
of different species, in the wild and in fossils.
While the Mendelians studied roses or flies

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:41.570
in labs.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.380
And they saw that some traits aren’t blended,
but jump around according to Mendel’s laws.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.820
And, meanwhile, the eugenicists studied variation
in human populations, for creepy reasons.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.340
Well, it’s time to bring these threads together
into a new paradigm for biology—one that

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.170
accounts for change over time in species through
exacting quantitative analysis on different

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.160
real-world populations.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:12.979
[Intro Music Plays]

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.270
Medicine changed a lot after 1900 due to the
discovery of different therapies like antibiotics.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.799
Likewise, biology changed a lot as scientists
combined different ideas, from natural selection

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:25.649
to statistics, in new ways.

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:30.549
The result is a framework called the Modern
Synthesis, or “neo-Darwinism.” And even

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.189
today, biologists mostly work within it.

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:38.130
Basically, the Modern Synthesis uses Mendelian
inheritance—Mendel’s rules—to explain

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.710
how Darwinian natural selection works in real
time.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.859
So Darwin and Wallace’s big ideas about
change over long epochs, across vast continents,

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:51.460
provided a solid theory for different researchers
to use when designing studies in quantitative

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.530
and population genetics, and when trying to
make sense of their results.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.420
What did the Modern Synthesis look like as
it happened? From 1928 to 1942, different

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.889
people applied one theory across a bunch of
forms of empirical science, gluing them together.

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:06.929
Hence, “synthesis!”

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.410
They also published influential books that
knit together Darwinism with Mendelism—such

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.780
as English ecological geneticist E. B. Ford’s
1931 classic, Mendelism and Evolution.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.460
Now, there were too many Modern Synthesizers
to shout out in one episode.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.080
But you’ve met a couple of them before.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.400
American geneticist and embryologist Thomas
Hunt Morgan, for example, directed the Fly

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.600
Room at Columbia from 1911 to 1928—which
we visited in Episode Twenty-Five.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.390
Morgan trained a lot of biologists who contributed
to the Modern Synthesis by exploring where

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.520
genes are physically located on the chromosomes
of fruit flies—

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.020
members of the species Drosophila melanogaster.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.050
They Fly Boys also created databases of different
alleles, or versions of a gene.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.770
For example, they figured out that the dominant
allele controlling the color of a fly’s

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.270
eyes makes it red, but recessive alleles exist
for brown or white eyes.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.380
In fact, the Fly Room scientists could inbreed
flies with specific traits until these mutants

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.450
were pretty much new species.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.880
But this didn’t prove how species were created
in the wild.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.010
Maybe, using artificial selection, the scientists
were doing something that Darwin and Wallace’s

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.120
proposed mechanism, natural selection didn’t
do, or did a different way.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.210
One of Morgan’s students, Ukrainian-American
geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky, resolved

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.090
this frustration by studying flies similar
to the lab’s Drosophila.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.180
Traveling from Canada to Mexico, Dobzhansky
demonstrated that natural groups of flies

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.550
have the same levels of genetic variation
as mutants in labs.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:38.021
In fact, Dobzhansky showed that, in the wild,
variations are inherited pretty much as Darwin

00:03:38.021 --> 00:03:39.620
would have predicted.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.620
And most mutations aren’t good or bad, which
is why variation is so high! He joined the

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:51.460
worlds laboratory genetics, the realm of experimentation,
and field naturalism, the realm of observation.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:57.630
Dobzhansky published his landmark book, Genetics
and the Origin of Species in 1937, which established

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.860
evolutionary genetics as a discipline.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:06.030
In his book, Dobzhansky defined evolution
as the “change in the frequency of an allele

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.950
within a gene pool.” Which is pretty much
how we teach it today.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.080
Darwin’s natural selection, culling certain
alleles from a population and allowing others

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.400
to reproduce, is one of the main drivers of
the evolution of species—along with completely

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.379
random mutation and some other forces called
gene flow and gene drift.

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:29.729
Dobzhansky also spent much of his career trying
to convince people not to think of humans

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:35.380
like inbred mutant flies: human “races”
are not genetically defined, but socially

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.380
constructed.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.610
The biological features that people have associated
with different races have changed over time,

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.090
and the boundaries between those races have
been redrawn.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.789
Dobzhansky was one of many scientists who
hoped that people would read about human genetics

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:53.490
and suddenly change their views on human difference.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.699
Turns out, we need more than just science.

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:00.139
Dobzhansky was not the only biologist to turn
to statistics as a tool for describing variation

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:01.240
in living things.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.650
Starting around 1918, English statistician
Ronald A. Fisher made numerous contributions

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.450
to statistics and genetics, culminating in
his banger, The Genetical Theory of Natural

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.050
Selection, in 1930.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.370
He showed statistically that what looks like
continuous natural selection is actually the

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.680
result of combined changes to many different
genes.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.810
Fisher’s work provided much of the foundation
for biostatistics, or how to apply statistics

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.930
to biology, including using statistical concepts
to understand the results of experiments.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:35.069
Unfortunately, Fisher was also a massive eugenicist
who insisted that racial differences in humans

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:37.229
mattered scientifically.

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:38.840
Sort of the opposite of Dobzhansky.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.710
English scientist, socialist organizer, and
consummate natty dresser J. B. S. Haldane

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.620
also helped pioneer biostatistics, and a bunch
of other stuff.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:53.439
In a 1915 paper, Haldane published the first
genetic linkage maps for mammals—showing

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:58.020
the order and relative distances of genes
in guinea pigs and mice, and later chickens.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.900
This was a big step, moving from flies to
mice!

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:06.660
Haldane’s work, like his 1932 book The Causes
of Evolution, helped establish—with Fisher

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.749
and American geneticist Sewall Wright—population
genetics.

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:15.840
This is the study of how genes vary in populations,
including models of how different alleles

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.069
will change in a population over time.

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:23.699
Other scientists focused not on gene-by-gene
change, but on whole species. German ornithologist

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:27.879
Ernst Mayr came up with the modern biological
definition of a species:

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:32.729
not just a bunch of similar organisms, but
a group that can only breed with each other.

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:36.779
Mayr published Systematics and the Origin
of Species from the Viewpoint of a Zoologist

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:43.279
in 1942, helping establish evolutionary biology
as distinct from genetics and the other life

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:44.279
sciences.

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:49.029
Finally, British evolutionary biologist and
eugenicist Julian Huxley published Evolution:

00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:51.909
The Modern Synthesis in 1942.

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:56.500
This one was kind of the capstone to the whole
Modern Synthesis: it summarized the research

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.680
uniting evolution and genetics up to World
War Two.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:05.589
And Julian Huxley coined many terms still
used by evolutionary biologists, such as cline,

00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:10.819
or the gradient of some trait—say, some
gene—within a population across a geographical

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:11.819
range.

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:16.180
Fun fact: Julian’s little brother, Aldous
Huxley wrote the dystopia Brave New World

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:21.779
in 1932, which argued that technology might
not only not be the solution to the world’s

00:07:21.779 --> 00:07:23.639
problems—it might be a major source of them.

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:28.539
And we have to shout-out their grandpa, Thomas
Henry Huxley, AKA “Darwin’s Bulldog,”

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:32.220
who helped make Darwin the most famous scientist
of the nineteenth century.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.669
Just… a lot going on with the Huxley family.

00:07:34.669 --> 00:07:38.599
So the Modern Synthesizers had links back
to Darwin himself.

00:07:38.599 --> 00:07:43.979
And with Julian Huxley’s book, the work
of figuring out the how of evolution was publicly

00:07:43.979 --> 00:07:47.250
announced, a little less than a century after
the Origin of Species.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:52.749
In the public eye, biology gained credibility.
After striving for decades to make their field

00:07:52.749 --> 00:07:58.969
better resemble physics, biologists were finally
using mathematics and massive data sets regularly

00:07:58.969 --> 00:08:00.080
and convincingly.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:04.460
It’s important to note that the Synthesizers
weren’t really a clearly defined group,

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.990
and they didn’t always agree with each other.

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:10.970
And while their work was transformative and
still provides a basis for some of the day-to-day

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:15.839
work for biologists, not everyone was down
with the Synthesis in the Forties, and new

00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:18.389
ideas continue to reshape it today.

00:08:18.389 --> 00:08:22.529
But still, by 1942, biology had become, by
its own account, “modern.”

00:08:22.529 --> 00:08:27.830
Notice, the Synthesizers were mostly English
and American dudes. Dobzhansky was born in

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:31.939
the Ukraine, but he immigrated to the United
States at age twenty seven.

00:08:31.939 --> 00:08:36.579
While they were meticulously using Mendelian
genetics to explain natural selection, their

00:08:36.579 --> 00:08:41.919
counterparts in the newly powerful Soviet
Union faced a different intellectual landscape.

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:45.410
Science and technology were strongly prized
in the Soviet Union.

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:50.550
After all, the country had been founded on
Marxist principles: there is only one, material

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:56.009
world, and whoever controls the means of production—capital
and technology—controls that world.

00:08:56.009 --> 00:09:01.300
After the World War Two, elite schools pumped
out many highly skilled engineers every year,

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:04.260
and Soviet scientists began to win Nobel Prizes.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.490
They had to catch up on the whole atomic bomb
fad, for one.

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:11.490
But in the life sciences, instead of competing
with the Modern Synthesizers, the Soviets

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:14.190
focused on applications— agriculture.

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:19.570
The question facing Soviet geneticists was,
how to improve varieties of wheat and other

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:24.100
staples so that they could grow longer, even
in the harsh environments that made up a lot

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.310
of the Soviet Union?

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:30.800
ThoughtBubble, show us what happened next:
Soviet agronomist Trofim Lysenko rose from

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:37.730
obscurity to become the director of the Soviet Union's Lenin All Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:43.519
all because he claimed that wheat subjected
to cold would produce a next generation better

00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:46.160
able to withstand even more cold.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:51.050
This process was call vernalization, and it
caught on, along with Lysenko’s other ideas

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:55.779
for farming, faster than scientists could
investigate whether they actually worked.

00:09:55.779 --> 00:10:00.660
So now, promoted up to science boss, Lysenko
focused on developing ideas similar to those

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.160
of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck,

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.670
the French evolutionary theorist who thought
that organisms could inherit characteristics

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:08.570
based on their individual experiences.

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:14.100
This theory, in which experience mattered
more than a competition among inherited genes,

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.910
was a better fit with Marxism.

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:21.570
Lysenko and his yes-men also made lots of
unscientific claims about agriculture, including

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:24.220
that rye could transform into wheat.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:29.110
He also used his power to destroy the careers
of geneticists in the Soviet Union—all of

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:30.110
them.

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:33.350
He had the real scientists fired and replaced
with his lackeys.

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:37.880
This system of science-purely-for-politics’-sake
became known as Lysenkoism.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:42.800
Now, all systems of science are political—saying
you’re “apolitical” just means you’re

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:47.120
for the status quo—but Lysenkoism wasn’t
even science any more.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.470
It was a pure power play.

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:52.649
So in 1940, the leading Soviet geneticist,
Nikolai Vavilov , was arrested.

00:10:52.649 --> 00:10:56.470
Lysenko took up his post as director of the
Institute of Genetics.

00:10:56.470 --> 00:11:02.709
In 1941, Vavilov was put through a sham trial
and found guilty of sabotage. Imprisoned,

00:11:02.709 --> 00:11:05.459
he died of malnutrition in 1943.

00:11:05.459 --> 00:11:06.530
Thanks Thoughtbubble.

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:12.540
And then, in 1948, Lysenko talked Joseph Stalin
into banning population genetics and other

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.639
types of “bourgeois” biology entirely.

00:11:15.639 --> 00:11:20.649
This meant no more artificial selection of
crop varietals based on neo-Darwinian science.

00:11:20.649 --> 00:11:25.759
The Soviet Union, already facing serious food
shortages, lost an important tool for fighting

00:11:25.759 --> 00:11:26.759
famine.

00:11:26.759 --> 00:11:31.540
Lysenkoism only ended in the 1960s, after
Lysenko’s Stalin died, and three prominent

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:35.910
Soviet physicists spoke out against his pseudoscience
and political manipulations.

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:40.949
But at least, thanks to scientists including
Julian Huxley, Nikolai Vavilov’s reputation

00:11:40.949 --> 00:11:43.910
as a great geneticist was finally restored.

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:48.459
Next time—another bridge from World War
Two to the Cold War: it’s time to meet Alan

00:11:48.459 --> 00:11:50.910
Turing and invent the computer.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:55.089
Crash Course History of Science is filmed
in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney studio in Missoula,
