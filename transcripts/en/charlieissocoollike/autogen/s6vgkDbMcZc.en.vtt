at least probably have done at some
 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.539
at least probably have done at some

worst crime stealing Mars bars or
illegal file sharing I would probably

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380
illegal file sharing I would probably
 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.410
illegal file sharing I would probably
say that stealing Mars bars is the worst

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420
say that stealing Mars bars is the worst
 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.940
say that stealing Mars bars is the worst

take a Mars bar but in the spots where
 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.100
take a Mars bar but in the spots where
your Mars bar would slay a brand new

is almost the same as getting a free
sample take this for example if you get

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369

that free Mars bar and you've never had

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930
that free Mars bar and you've never had
 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.630
that free Mars bar and you've never had
a Mars bar before and you try this Mars

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640

if you genuinely like the Mars bar then
the logical conclusion is that if you
