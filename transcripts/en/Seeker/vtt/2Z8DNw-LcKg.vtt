00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.740
DINOSAUR SEX.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.579
Now that I have your attention, how did dinosaur
sex even work?

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:22.740
Like, did they… you know… because they're
kind of … … Yeah, it's awkward.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.250
Dinosaurs were big and now they're small,
some had feathers and some didn't, they ran

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.910
the world for 130 million years, and needed
to keep their species going -- but for a LONG

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.659
time scientists were pretty clueless about
dinosaur sex.

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:39.890
There have been writings on dinosaur sex for
over 100 years, but it's all speculative,

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.050
because we've never caught two dinosaurs in
the act!

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.030
Robert Krulwich from NPR writes about 47-million
year old turtles who were trapped in mud DURING

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.500
sex, but we've never found a fornicating fossil…
like… a Fukuiraptor.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.500
THAT'S A REAL DINOSAUR.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.319
I DIDN'T EVEN NEED TO MAKE THE JOKE.

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:01.139
Firstly, scientists believe dinosaurs had
cloaca.

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:06.940
The cloaca is essentially a hole at the end
of the intestinal tract, but inside the cloaca

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.680
are hidden sex organs!

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.630
A lot of birds reproduce by touching their
cloaca together, called a "cloacal kiss."

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.080
A little squirt of sperm from the male and
the act of mating is complete!

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.080
BOOM!

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.710
This answers the long-held question around
the DNewsroom, did dinosaurs have testicles?

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:30.350
YES, the male ones did, anyway, but like many
animals, they live INSIDE the body, not outside.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.890
But there were probably some penile dinos
too, just like modern animals, their sex organs

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.390
probably ran the gamut.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:43.410
Which means some dino may have had a duck-like,
spiked, spiraled, crazy murder-penis! *shudder*

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.360
Outside of the physical structures though,
a mating display is important for most animals.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.620
We can assume that many of the prominent structures
were party to dino mating displays.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.430
When it comes to the smooth male and females…
[[dinosaurs with sexy music]] [a]like, the

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.200
ones WITHOUT spikes… it was pretty straightforward.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.780
The long neck of the apatosaurus, might have
been used used to defend, as well as show

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.780
sexual power.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.310
[b] Perhaps, they intertwined the necks during
courting, or would show off how long or powerful

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.640
their necks were.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:21.010
Scientists are still working on the mechanics
of stegosaurus sex.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.190
Perhaps the female lay down to keep the male
from getting stabbed?

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.290
Maybe they carefully backed into each other?

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.010
They're not entirely sure…

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.260
Which actually makes a lot of sense!

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.319
This REALLY is a bunch of dino-nerds guessing
about how species which died 70 millions years

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.310
ago communicate their sexual interest.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.480
[[pause to think]] Yeah, it's a lot of guesswork.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.150
Someone get their 3D computer models ready,
we need to make some dino magic!

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.990
The part of the mating display we DO know,
is trapped in fossilized melanosomes.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.750
Melanosomes are the structures inside a feather
that gives it color.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.620
A study from July put the final flourish on
our feathered friends.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:04.120
Many scientists believe most species of dinosaurs
had feathers, and thanks to fossilized melanosomes,

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.390
many are confirmed to have sported the fluffy
stuff!

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.070
Just like their bird ancestors, dinosaurs
probably had feathers for camouflage AND mating

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.070
ornamentation!

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:18.290
In the end, problem with KNOWING about dinosex
is the soft tissues.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.160
That's not a sexy pun.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.540
See, some animals, like mice or elephants,
have penis bones; literally bones inside the

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.540
penis.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.630
So a fossilized elephant would have a pretty
obvious sex organ there…

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.540
Dinosaurs had only soft tissues for sex organs
which means they didn't fossilize.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.390
Our best guess is to use modern birds and
crocodiles to approximate dino-sex, because

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.010
they are both dinosaur ancestors.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.739
Chances are, with thousands of dino species,
they had a variety of different ways to breed!

00:03:49.739 --> 00:04:03.890
Like Ian Malcolm said, "Life… finds 
a way."

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.440
