00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.630
With a billion new users
expected online by 2017,

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.260
there's a huge opportunity
to grow your business.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.880
Most of these users will
be in emerging markets,

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.630
so you should consider
how they may differ

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.370
from your current audience.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.640
Here are 10 tips to
help you get ready.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.650
Speak your user's language, in
your app and on the Play Store.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.930
Make sure your users
understand your content

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.540
by localizing your app.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.870
First, dates and time should be
internationalized and displayed

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.700
according to their
phone settings.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.390
For many markets, numeracy
is higher than literacy.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.840
Use fewer words and
provide graphical cues

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.910
with audio and voice support.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.560
Keep interaction simple.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.220
Avoid scrolling menus and use
tappable, browsable interfaces.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.000
For example, Auto
Complete and curated lists

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.690
can be better than
searching and filtering.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.910
Design your app for
different languages,

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.890
allowing for different sentence
lengths and structures.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.460
The app translation service,
available from the Developer

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.020
Console, can help.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.609
And remember to test everything
with native speakers.

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:08.230
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.240
Deliver the right
content and features.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.930
Research new markets
thoroughly and build features

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.630
on local trends and preferences.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.720
For instance,
think mobile first.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.970
Don't rely on familiarity
with email and web passwords.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.730
Offer phone number-based
registration.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.870
Multi-SIM phones
are also popular,

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.450
which you can detect
since Android 5.1,

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.200
in order to, for example, adapt
your apps data usage by SIM.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.040
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.350
Allow for slow and
intermittent data connections.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.760
Many users will not have access
to reliable data connections.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.500
It's important to adapt
your app to use less data

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.910
and, if possible, to
also work offline.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.670
Try to separate UI from
network activities,

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.980
so users can precache
content over Wi-Fi.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.250
Optimize all images and
consider using webP.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.190
It's smaller in file size than
alternatives for the same image

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.210
quality.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.030
You can also give
users control over

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.790
when and what connection
they use, particularly

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.500
for large downloads or syncing.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.600
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.640
Accommodate low end devices
and smaller screens.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.460
In emerging markets,
many devices

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.370
tend to have small
screens, so make

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.270
sure you optimize your UI by
testing on multiple screen

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.240
sizes.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.940
You should also adapt your
app to low end devices, which

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.710
may have low memory,
low processing

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.010
power, and low resolution.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.940
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.430
Ensure your apps will run on
older versions of Android.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.140
To reach the next billion
users in emerging markets,

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.840
consider backward
compatibility to Jelly Bean,

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.016
and where practical, back
to Ice Cream Sandwich.

00:02:40.016 --> 00:02:43.420
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.190
Optimize for less phone memory
and shorter battery life.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.080
Your user's phone may
have 512 megabytes

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.190
of internal memory
or less, so apps

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.880
need to be efficient
with memory usage.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.310
Also disk space is lower
than developed markets,

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.440
so keep your APK size
under 10 megabytes.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.680
Optimize the
contents of your APK

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.500
by using highly targeted images,
mobile optimized libraries,

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.420
remove redundant content,
and enable ProGuard to

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.850
out unused code.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.005
Also, make sure your app can
run from SD card storage.

00:03:15.005 --> 00:03:17.980
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.620
Consume only the
data you need to.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.370
In most emerging markets,
users will pay for data

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.690
as they use it.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.230
Your app's initial
download, each update,

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.500
and foreground and
background data all add cost.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.010
Balance the benefits of
an update with the cost

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.950
to your user of installing it.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.550
Consider less frequent
releases and balance

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.190
the cost of installing an update
with the benefits to your user.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.070
Avoid background
services where possible.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.600
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.180
Reflect local buying
habits and cycles.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.890
Localize your prices and
remember a simple exchange rate

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.020
conversion may not be right.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.110
A good onboarding flow is
vital to ensure maximum buyer

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.140
conversion, provide app
and subscription trials,

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.850
so the user can try
before they buy.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.190
And when planning promotions,
understand local buying cycles.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.710
Link promotional activity
with holidays, events,

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.740
and monthly data
plan refresh dates.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.670

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.950
Grow your audience
with app promotion.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.250
When you're ready to
launch, app install

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.370
ads can help you
grow an audience,

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.150
and universal app campaigns
that you set up straight

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.370
from the Developer
Console make it easy.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.480
Your campaign is
automatically optimized

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.390
to meet your CPA targets by
finding the right balance

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.910
on Google Search, Google

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.940
Network, and YouTube.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.060
Research the best local
marketing channels

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.730
you can promote your app
on and leverage YouTube

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.160
and other popular social media
sites in target countries.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.760
Engage and support
your users locally.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.860
Don't leave your users to work
things out for themselves.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.620
Start by reading and
responding to app reviews.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.670
Then go local by
creating user groups

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:09.050
for countries or languages
through social media channels.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.910
Build a core of power
users and encourage them

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.730
with involvement in beta
tests and update plans.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.400
And look for ways to help
them share their findings

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.450
by offering them access to your
support team or developers.
