00:00:06.762 --> 00:00:09.695
On July 4, 2015,

00:00:09.695 --> 00:00:16.526
a NASA spacecraft called New Horizons 
was 5 billion kilometers away from Earth.

00:00:16.526 --> 00:00:21.925
It was only 10 days away from Pluto, 
after flying for 9.5 years,

00:00:21.925 --> 00:00:25.747
when it suddenly dropped out of contact.

00:00:25.747 --> 00:00:27.456
But let’s back up a little.

00:00:27.456 --> 00:00:29.295
As of 1989,

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:34.416
mankind had successfully sent craft 
to every known planet in the solar system

00:00:34.416 --> 00:00:36.812
except one—Pluto.

00:00:36.812 --> 00:00:39.917
You may have heard that astronomers 
don’t consider Pluto

00:00:39.917 --> 00:00:42.402
or its brethren to be planets.

00:00:42.402 --> 00:00:46.433
However, most planetary 
scientists still do,

00:00:46.433 --> 00:00:49.423
which is why we're using 
that terminology here.

00:00:49.423 --> 00:00:52.708
There’s a limited amount 
we can learn about Pluto from Earth

00:00:52.708 --> 00:00:54.696
because it’s so far from us.

00:00:54.696 --> 00:00:57.773
Pluto, however, is a scientific goldmine.

00:00:57.773 --> 00:01:00.646
It’s located in a region 
called the Kuiper Belt,

00:01:00.646 --> 00:01:02.617
home to many small planets,

00:01:02.617 --> 00:01:06.035
hundreds of thousands 
of ancient icy objects,

00:01:06.035 --> 00:01:08.537
and trillions of comets.

00:01:08.537 --> 00:01:12.758
This mysterious region holds clues 
to the formation of our solar system,

00:01:12.758 --> 00:01:16.825
and it was long, 
tantalizingly beyond our reach.

00:01:16.825 --> 00:01:18.776
Until New Horizons.

00:01:18.776 --> 00:01:20.917
Its objectives: explore Pluto,

00:01:20.917 --> 00:01:23.965
collect as much scientific 
data as possible,

00:01:23.965 --> 00:01:25.635
transmit it back to Earth,

00:01:25.635 --> 00:01:29.498
then explore farther out 
in the Kuiper Belt.

00:01:29.498 --> 00:01:33.048
To achieve this, the New Horizons team 
outfitted their craft

00:01:33.048 --> 00:01:36.056
with seven state-of-the-art 
scientific instruments.

00:01:36.056 --> 00:01:37.966
Those included Ralph,

00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:39.933
a set of cameras powerful enough

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:43.506
to capture features the size 
of city blocks in Manhattan

00:01:43.506 --> 00:01:46.967
from tens of thousands of kilometers away.

00:01:46.967 --> 00:01:49.867
And REX, designed to use radio waves

00:01:49.867 --> 00:01:53.766
to measure Pluto’s atmospheric pressure 
and temperature.

00:01:53.766 --> 00:01:59.106
All of the onboard equipment had to be
built to be both reliable and lightweight

00:01:59.106 --> 00:02:02.537
because New Horizons had an
additional challenge;

00:02:02.537 --> 00:02:06.638
it had to reach its target 
as fast as possible.

00:02:06.638 --> 00:02:07.836
Why?

00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:11.567
Around 2020, Pluto will reach 
a point in its orbit

00:02:11.567 --> 00:02:14.367
where its atmosphere could freeze.

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:16.240
And due to the tilt of its axis,

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.595
more and more of Pluto’s surface 
is shrouded in darkness every year.

00:02:21.595 --> 00:02:27.317
Pluto completes a full orbit
once every 248 Earth years,

00:02:27.317 --> 00:02:32.076
so it would be a long wait 
for the next prime opportunity to visit.

00:02:32.076 --> 00:02:35.156
To see how New Horizons 
got to Pluto in time,

00:02:35.156 --> 00:02:37.286
let’s jump to its launch.

00:02:37.286 --> 00:02:42.206
Its three rocket stages accelerated 
New Horizons to such great speeds

00:02:42.206 --> 00:02:47.835
that it crossed the 400,000 kilometers 
to the moon in just nine hours.

00:02:47.835 --> 00:02:51.025
About a year later, 
the craft reached Jupiter

00:02:51.025 --> 00:02:54.029
and got what’s called a gravity assist.

00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:56.896
That’s where it flies close enough
to the gas giant

00:02:56.896 --> 00:03:00.236
to receive a gravitational
slingshot effect.

00:03:00.236 --> 00:03:05.736
New Horizons was then flying 
at around 50,000 kilometers per hour,

00:03:05.736 --> 00:03:10.935
as it would for the next eight years 
to cross the remaining gulf to Pluto.

00:03:10.935 --> 00:03:13.536
Going at such an astonishing speed

00:03:13.536 --> 00:03:17.225
meant that slowing down 
to get into orbit or land

00:03:17.225 --> 00:03:19.376
would’ve been impossible.

00:03:19.376 --> 00:03:22.086
That’s why New Horizons was on 
a flyby mission,

00:03:22.086 --> 00:03:27.433
where it would get just one chance to
scream by Pluto and make its observations.

00:03:27.433 --> 00:03:29.596
The flyby would have 
to be fully automated,

00:03:29.596 --> 00:03:33.396
since at that distance, any signals 
to guide it from Earth

00:03:33.396 --> 00:03:36.096
would take 4.5 hours to reach it.

00:03:36.096 --> 00:03:40.809
So the team loaded the ship’s computer 
with a series of thousands of commands,

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:42.636
called the core load,

00:03:42.636 --> 00:03:47.467
that would begin to execute 
when the craft was 6.5 days from Pluto.

00:03:47.467 --> 00:03:50.497
But when New Horizons 
was just ten days out,

00:03:50.497 --> 00:03:53.075
disaster almost struck.

00:03:53.075 --> 00:03:55.945
Ground control lost contact 
with the spacecraft.

00:03:55.945 --> 00:04:00.577
After two nerve-wracking hours,
New Horizons came back online,

00:04:00.577 --> 00:04:04.896
but mission control discovered 
that its main computer had rebooted,

00:04:04.896 --> 00:04:09.185
losing the entire core load 
and other critical data.

00:04:09.185 --> 00:04:12.147
Without that, it would soon 
whizz by Pluto

00:04:12.147 --> 00:04:14.977
with virtually nothing 
to show for the mission.

00:04:14.977 --> 00:04:18.446
Alice Bowman, 
the mission’s Operations Manager,

00:04:18.446 --> 00:04:23.098
led a team for 72 sleepless hours 
to get the instructions

00:04:23.098 --> 00:04:26.696
loaded back into New Horizons in time.

00:04:26.696 --> 00:04:31.087
Without room for a single error,
she and her team pulled it off,

00:04:31.087 --> 00:04:35.725
and New Horizons began taking 
and broadcasting breathtaking images.

00:04:35.725 --> 00:04:39.656
Those observations have revealed 
a delightfully varied world,

00:04:39.656 --> 00:04:41.136
with ground fogs,

00:04:41.136 --> 00:04:42.767
high altitude hazes,

00:04:42.767 --> 00:04:44.072
possible clouds,

00:04:44.072 --> 00:04:45.056
canyons,

00:04:45.056 --> 00:04:46.396
towering mountains,

00:04:46.396 --> 00:04:47.517
faults,

00:04:47.517 --> 00:04:48.428
craters,

00:04:48.428 --> 00:04:49.696
polar caps,

00:04:49.696 --> 00:04:50.887
glaciers,

00:04:50.887 --> 00:04:52.476
apparent dune fields,

00:04:52.476 --> 00:04:54.696
suspected ice volcanoes,

00:04:54.696 --> 00:04:57.266
evidence for past flowing liquids,

00:04:57.266 --> 00:04:59.091
and more.

00:04:59.091 --> 00:05:00.942
One of the most exciting discoveries

00:05:00.942 --> 00:05:05.687
is the 1000-kilometer-wide
Sputnik Planitia glacier.

00:05:05.687 --> 00:05:11.657
Sputnik Planitia is mainly composed 
of slowly churning frozen nitrogen,

00:05:11.657 --> 00:05:16.126
and we’ve never seen anything 
like it in our solar system.

00:05:16.126 --> 00:05:18.886
The exploration of Pluto 
was a great success,

00:05:18.886 --> 00:05:21.446
but New Horizons isn’t done yet.

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:24.398
On January 1, 2019,

00:05:24.398 --> 00:05:28.280
it’ll break its own record for 
furthest explored object

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:34.356
when it visits a Kuiper Belt Object 
called 2014 MU69,

00:05:34.356 --> 00:05:39.977
which is orbiting the sun another billion
kilometers farther away than Pluto.

00:05:39.977 --> 00:05:43.566
The world is holding its breath 
to see what it’ll find there.
