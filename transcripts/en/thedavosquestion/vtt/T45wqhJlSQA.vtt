00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:08.580
&gt;&gt; So I'm off to Davos.
What do I want from world leaders at Davos?

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.300
Well, I think first of all getting this issue
on people's agendas is so

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.160
important.
We need to break the taboo.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.820
We need to move FGM out of the silent margins
where it's been and

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.980
really into the mainstream.
I want everyone who is working on women empowerment

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.930
and girls education
to ensure that FGM is on their agenda.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.359
I want people to realize the enormity of what's
happening to 3 million

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:48.039
girls a year.
I want people to believe that this is our

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:50.860
problem.
It's not just happening elsewhere.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.629
It's happening within our communities.
And we are a global community.

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.390
Things like this shouldn't be, oh, it's Africa,
oh, it's Indonesia, oh,

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.909
it's Islam.
It's not.

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:10.780
It's up to all of us to play a part in this.
I want to see if we can coalesce and get more

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.720
funding and more
resources to this issue.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.440
Yes, times are tough and there are humanitarian
disasters, everything

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.540
in the globe that's happening.
And yet, still, when I go to sleep every night

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.440
I can still hear that
little girl and what's she's saying is why

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.490
won't people help me?
I want to make sure that we can all wake up

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.240
and say that we've done
what we can.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.300
And no one more than global leaders who are
taking us through, who are

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:51.300
steering our planet into the next decade.
I want them to be thinking we can do something

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.860
about this.
This shouldn't happen on our watch.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.350
Let's wake up and let's end FGM now.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.560
