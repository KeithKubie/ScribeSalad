1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,940
[inaudible].

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,180
We're continuing our partnership with
learn liberty this week and joining me

3
00:00:08,181 --> 00:00:12,140
today as a senior fellow at the Mercatus
Center at George Mason University,

4
00:00:12,141 --> 00:00:16,130
as well as a professor of economics
at George Mason. Don Boudreaux,

5
00:00:16,131 --> 00:00:19,430
welcome to the Rubin report. Happy
to be here. I am glad you are here.

6
00:00:19,431 --> 00:00:22,190
I saw you speak about
a year ago in Dallas.

7
00:00:22,191 --> 00:00:26,180
I want to get the exact title of
the speech right. Uh, it was called,

8
00:00:26,181 --> 00:00:31,100
can we bring sound economic thinking
to Washington? That's a tough task.

9
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,620
That was a year ago and,
uh,

10
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,950
I don't think there's much sound
economic thinking or sound thinking in

11
00:00:36,951 --> 00:00:38,900
Washington.
Forget economics for a second.

12
00:00:38,901 --> 00:00:41,600
These things don't seem to
go together these days. Uh,

13
00:00:41,601 --> 00:00:45,110
Washington seems to repel sound
thinking. It's, it's, uh, it's a,

14
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:47,830
it attracts on sound thinking. Yeah. Well,

15
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,990
you think it was always that
way or are we in unique times,

16
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,760
but we're definitely in unique talents,
unique times. So I was born in 1958,

17
00:00:55,761 --> 00:00:59,710
so I came of age right when
Ronald Reagan. Right. You know,

18
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,550
at the end of the Carter administration,

19
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,450
when even Carter's
pushing for deregulation,

20
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,830
at least accepting deregulation
taxes were being cut airline to being

21
00:01:06,831 --> 00:01:09,350
deregulated surface transportation
is being deregulated.

22
00:01:09,351 --> 00:01:10,940
Reagan gets elected in 1980.

23
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,770
Milton Friedman has as popular
show on PBS called free to choose.

24
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:20,800
Uh, you know, Thomas, I'll learn about
Thomas soul. Everything seems very, oh,

25
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,760
this world's fine. Yeah. And
so in my life, in my life,

26
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:30,560
uh, there was a period in the past
when I was thinking was more sound,

27
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:35,330
I could quibble with it. Yeah.
But compared to today, it was,

28
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:40,160
it was outstanding because it's
definitely, it's definitely declined.

29
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,510
Yeah. It's hard to imagine even that
around the time of Jimmy Carter that

30
00:01:44,511 --> 00:01:48,470
deregulation, I mean that, that Democrats
could have had anything to do with that.

31
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:53,420
And yet the Ted Kennedy was a major
force behind airline deregulation.

32
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,570
So there was, there was something,
I'm not sure what it was exactly.

33
00:01:56,571 --> 00:02:00,860
It was something in the air, uh, starting
in the late seventies. And so, you know,

34
00:02:00,861 --> 00:02:03,740
I was a young man then I just took it for
granted. Oh Wow. All right. This is fine.

35
00:02:03,741 --> 00:02:08,600
You know, we're, we're
winning. It culminates in 1989
with the collapse of the,

36
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:12,680
of the, of the Iron Curtain in
1991, the collapse of Soviet Union.

37
00:02:12,681 --> 00:02:14,000
And then here we are,

38
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:18,320
2018 and a lot of nonsense
is back on the front burner.

39
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,790
Nonsense is back.

40
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:22,670
So let's jump back though to the seventies
for a second because I watched an

41
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:24,050
interview with you this morning.

42
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:28,940
Something happened to you I believe
in 1977 that that woke you up.

43
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:32,840
And I think it sort of is a nice entry
into everything else that, you know,

44
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,030
I know said, yeah, I just
the most important day.

45
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,440
What happened to you in 1977 you can come
up with a couple of options. Yeah, no,

46
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:42,910
I know it was, the date was, was,
was, was was January 24th, 1977.

47
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:47,900
I remember there was a, um, I was in
college. I went to please my mother.

48
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:52,880
My plan was to drink beer, chase
girls. I did a lot of the former,

49
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,310
I wasn't successful at the ladder,
but I was going,

50
00:02:55,311 --> 00:02:58,100
I was going to drop out of college and
work at the ship yard where my parents

51
00:02:58,101 --> 00:03:02,980
worked. So I needed a class to fit my
schedule. I needed a Monday, Wednesday,

52
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,410
Friday class. I take this class called
economics, didn't know what it was,

53
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,200
took it and uh,
uh,

54
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,770
I had a great teacher and so she drew
supply and demand curves on the board and

55
00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:11,981
she said,

56
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:14,860
look what happens when the government
prevents the price of something from

57
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,310
rising to its market level. It
creates a shortage. She says,

58
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,460
you remember the gasoline
shortages of 1973 or so? Yeah,

59
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:26,700
I was in those and I just thought the
beauty of this economic explanation for

60
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,420
the gasoline shortage was so spectacular.

61
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:34,270
I wanted to learn more about the subject.
And so in very short order,

62
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,390
I just fell in love with economics. I'm
still in love with it to this day. Yeah.

63
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:42,220
So tell me what happened after that. So
now you have your spark and what sort of,

64
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,370
what academic proceeds did you have
that got you to where you are in a very

65
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:46,031
lucky,
again,

66
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:49,270
she was a really good teacher and
it wasn't a famous economist at all.

67
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,390
She was a very good teacher.
She took a great interest in her students.

68
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,630
She taught economics as if
it was something relevant
to the real world rather

69
00:03:55,631 --> 00:04:00,460
than just a mathematical, a puzzle.
Uh, and there was another guy at my,

70
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:00,891
I want to put,

71
00:04:00,891 --> 00:04:04,340
it's called Nicholls State University
and Tibideau Louisiana that says it's a

72
00:04:04,341 --> 00:04:05,174
very small school.

73
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:10,290
But I had another professor there who
was into Milton Friedman into higher,

74
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,440
uh,
into Ludwig von Mises into James Buchanan,

75
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:17,500
who later became my colleague at George
Mason. So I would go to his office,

76
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:20,350
his name is bill field,
and he would give me these books.

77
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,920
And so I remember just just
tearing through these books
and it just made so much

78
00:04:23,921 --> 00:04:28,090
sense to me. I realized in reading
these books that all my life,

79
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,050
I didn't give much thought to politics,
not much conscious thought, uh,

80
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,610
but all my life,
uh,

81
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,930
I think somewhere deep inside of me
was a classical liberal or libertarian,

82
00:04:37,931 --> 00:04:42,310
someone who believed that is basically
impolite to button to other people's

83
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:47,050
business. Uh, and, and, and, and,
and not only in polite, I mean it's,

84
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,940
it's downright, it's downright
offensive to do so. Yeah.

85
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:55,330
You just said to him may buzz phrases.
So classical, liberal and Libertarian.

86
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:58,510
Now one of the questions I
get most because I define,

87
00:04:58,511 --> 00:05:02,530
I say that I am a classical liberal
if I need, if I need a label on it,

88
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:04,450
that's what I am.
And people will always say to me,

89
00:05:04,451 --> 00:05:06,790
because I talk about many of
the things that you teach about,

90
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,170
about free markets and all that stuff,

91
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,770
and I believe that freedom is the
best way for humans to flourish.

92
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,910
People will say, Dave,
you're really a libertarian.

93
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:18,340
You're just holding onto this definition
of liberalism from 18, whatever.

94
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,170
Do you see a meaningful,

95
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,690
how would you define each one and
do you see a meaningful distinction?

96
00:05:22,691 --> 00:05:25,360
I don't see much of a distinction. Depends
on who you talk to. Some people see,

97
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,010
see distinctions.
I think where they both have in common.

98
00:05:28,011 --> 00:05:29,590
It may be distinctions at the margin.

99
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:34,450
Libertarians maybe tend to be a little
bit more radical. Uh, uh, but, uh, uh,

100
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:39,490
a what distinguishes classical liberals
and Libertarians as I'd have broadly

101
00:05:39,701 --> 00:05:44,080
from almost any other political group,
a is the consistent,

102
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,333
uh,
uh,

103
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:50,390
believe that any exercise of power by
the state must meet a huge burden of

104
00:05:51,371 --> 00:05:53,800
proof. Uh, the, the, the,

105
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:57,950
the burden of proof is not upon the
individual to make the case for his or her

106
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,280
freedom. It's upon the state
to make the case, to Intro,

107
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,950
to override that freedom.

108
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,360
I believe in libertarian
classical liberals as I think
of them believe that that

109
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:12,440
burden is a real one and it's a heavy one.
Sometimes it can be met,

110
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,580
but too often the reverse is in place.

111
00:06:16,581 --> 00:06:20,120
People believe that you have to,
that the burden is on those of us who,

112
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:24,200
who defend freedom to make the case for
freedom. And I think it's backwards.

113
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:27,730
So basically you view it as sort of a
bottom up way of looking at things, right?

114
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,510
It's about the individual first.

115
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:34,190
And the government is not giving you your
freedom. It can take it away. However,

116
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:38,570
by instituting all sorts of policies.
Yeah. I, I'm in this case, I am,

117
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,080
uh, I think John Locke was right and
John Locke wasn't the only person,

118
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:45,860
but John Locke most famously, you
know, made the argument in the, in,

119
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,880
in the second treatise on
government that, um, uh, you know,

120
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:55,150
human beings have rights and human
beings delegate to the government,

121
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,630
uh, powers that you, that,

122
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,140
that those who do the delegation believe
are appropriate for the government to

123
00:07:03,141 --> 00:07:05,960
defend those rights. Um, know we,

124
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,170
we can quibble about how historically
accurate that is, but I like, I,

125
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,710
I think that perspective is
philosophically correct. Uh,

126
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:20,050
no government gives me or you rights
governments are excellent at offending

127
00:07:20,421 --> 00:07:23,180
rights and taking them away. Uh, but,

128
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:27,290
but just because government is to protect
her of rights doesn't mean he gives us

129
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,300
rice just because farmers,
uh,

130
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:34,120
because we couldn't live without farmers
if no one grew food. And, and, and,

131
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,200
and did ranching,
we would all starve.

132
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:39,860
That doesn't mean that we
owe our lives to farmers. Uh,

133
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:43,060
one of the great things about the
society that we live in is that it's a,

134
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,430
it was bit higher called the great
society to be distinguished from Lyndon

135
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,910
Johnson's great society. And
that is, it is a society of many,

136
00:07:49,911 --> 00:07:53,330
many individuals each specialized
in doing various things.

137
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:57,190
We're all coordinated by the price
system and by the rule of law. Uh,

138
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,740
and so each of us makes a
contribution to the welfare of others,

139
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:05,320
but no one of us is utterly
essential. And that's, uh,

140
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,810
that's, that's uh, it's a really
good system, I believe. Yeah.

141
00:08:08,811 --> 00:08:11,870
So I want to talk more about hiking a
little bit because you do run the cafe

142
00:08:11,871 --> 00:08:13,150
high tech blog.
Uh,

143
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:18,190
you mentioned the burden of proof that
the government has to meet to say when

144
00:08:18,681 --> 00:08:22,730
it's right to actually infringe on some
of your rights or basically do things.

145
00:08:22,731 --> 00:08:24,530
Yeah.
So this is where I would say the,

146
00:08:24,531 --> 00:08:27,110
the classical liberal and the libertarian
position is there a little bit

147
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:27,381
different.

148
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:30,950
I see some utility for the state and
although I'd usually want it done at the,

149
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:33,680
at the state level, not the
federal level. And Libertarians,

150
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:35,900
it's sort of hard to
pin on when it's enough.

151
00:08:35,901 --> 00:08:38,690
And you alluded to that when
you talk to libertarians,

152
00:08:38,691 --> 00:08:42,830
how do you get to a place
where, where it's not, you
know, I always make the joke,

153
00:08:42,831 --> 00:08:45,860
it's like w eventually
you'll just be in mad max or,

154
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:49,230
or the true anarcho capitalists,
which I enjoy talking to,

155
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:53,260
but I view it as more of an intellectual
exercise than a practical. Yeah. I mean,

156
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:57,050
I, I'm very sympathetic to anarchical
philosophically I'm, yeah, but I'm not,

157
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,030
I'm not a, uh, uh,

158
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,610
a blow things up kind of guy and I'm
way too much of a hierarchy and to

159
00:09:02,611 --> 00:09:06,810
understand that you just can't, uh,
uh, replace social institutions,

160
00:09:06,811 --> 00:09:11,811
wholesale society has to evolve to
wherever it's going to be from being a

161
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:16,360
realist. I mean, you couldn't blow it
up. I fit well, yes you could, but, but,

162
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:21,000
but history has a lot of really telling
examples about attempts to blow up

163
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:25,530
society's wholesale. And those examples,
I've never turned out well in practice.

164
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:26,530
Uh,
let,

165
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:31,200
let me say among the people who will
call themselves classical liberals,

166
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:35,270
right?
None of them are ever at a w whatever,

167
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:39,090
express any sympathy for Anaco
capitalism among libertarians.

168
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:42,360
Some of them will say, oh no, I, I, I
believe there's a role for the government.

169
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,301
But you do it.

170
00:09:43,301 --> 00:09:45,840
If people who classify themselves
as Libertarians who say at least,

171
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,070
at least in principle,

172
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:52,260
I believe that it's society could
exist without any formal institution of

173
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:56,810
monopolized coercion. And I, I
am in that ladder ladder. Yeah.

174
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,420
I might be the one classical
liberal who will do it or it,

175
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:02,010
that maybe by that definition I'm a
little more libertarian. But again,

176
00:10:02,011 --> 00:10:03,310
these things all, yeah. You know,

177
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,840
it's really sort of the narcissism of
small differences that's exactly in this

178
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:11,280
little place. All right. So what
are some of the basic principles?

179
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,250
You're a professor.

180
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:16,140
What are the basic principles that
people should know about economics?

181
00:10:16,141 --> 00:10:19,470
I know I'm giving you a wide one there,
but for someone watching this, that,

182
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:23,630
that's waiting for their 19,
77 moment. Yeah. Uh, so, uh,

183
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:27,810
in no particular order, number
one, scarcity is unavoidable.

184
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:30,090
We live in a world of scarce resources,

185
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,510
which means that if you use some
resources to do this good thing,

186
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,470
you take resources away from the ability
to do other good things in both good

187
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:39,120
things.
But we have to choose,

188
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:41,400
do we want to do this good thing or
do we want to do that? Good thing.

189
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:45,120
Second thing to note in order
to make that decision, uh,

190
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:49,620
we want the people involved who are
going to be affected both by the loss of

191
00:10:49,621 --> 00:10:50,670
that which is not done.

192
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:55,420
And by the benefit of that which is done
to express their opinions. Honestly, how,

193
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,970
how valuable is this thing that we propose
to do and how valuable is this thing

194
00:10:59,971 --> 00:11:04,500
that we propose to give up in order to
do this first thing? And then to do that,

195
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,260
we,
you,

196
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,880
you need people on the ground who are
actually affected by these decisions to

197
00:11:08,881 --> 00:11:13,110
have a, a meaningful say. You don't
want a third party looking down,

198
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,140
making declarations. Oh, I
think you should have that.

199
00:11:16,141 --> 00:11:18,210
And I think you should not have had that.

200
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:23,210
So any social mechanism that gives each
of us as much of a say as possible in,

201
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:28,250
uh, how we use resources and, and,

202
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:33,280
and make the evaluations about what w
what will happen if we use resources in

203
00:11:34,981 --> 00:11:38,670
this way and what will give up if we
use resources in this way that that's

204
00:11:38,671 --> 00:11:39,420
important.

205
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:44,420
Unintended consequences is
another important concept.

206
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,970
You know,
Adam Smith in the wealth of nations,

207
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,020
which is rightly considered to be the
start starting point of modern scientific

208
00:11:52,021 --> 00:11:53,260
economics.
He,

209
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:57,820
he famously talked about the invisible
hand and this is a, this is this sort of,

210
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,850
uh, an unintended consequences
kind of explanations,

211
00:12:00,851 --> 00:12:02,260
not from the benevolence of the butcher,

212
00:12:02,261 --> 00:12:03,940
the brewer or the baker
that we expect our dinner.

213
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:08,500
But from their regard to
their own interests, uh,
they, they don't dislike you.

214
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,150
They value as a customer,

215
00:12:10,151 --> 00:12:14,260
but they are doing their jobs
not primarily to help you.

216
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:18,460
They're doing their jobs to help
themselves and you are buying from them,

217
00:12:18,461 --> 00:12:21,400
not primarily to help them but
primarily to help you and your family.

218
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,910
And in that way, everyone's either, so
this is a good unintended consequence,

219
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:28,150
but you have, you have bad
unintended consequences as well.

220
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,690
One of my favorite examples of
a bad unintended consequences
of the minimum wage

221
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,620
raise the minimum wage.

222
00:12:32,621 --> 00:12:36,280
It looks like you helping low skill
workers and you might have some of them,

223
00:12:36,281 --> 00:12:39,520
but in fact you're putting other low
skill workers out of jobs and you're

224
00:12:39,521 --> 00:12:43,270
keeping them out of the job market
for longer. And so economists,

225
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,490
I think what makes a good economist,

226
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:49,120
which distinguishes a good economy is from
a bad economist or a non economist is,

227
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:53,860
is a consistency and asking questions,
always asking as compared to what,

228
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:57,400
as compared to what, where did that come
from? How are we going to pay for that?

229
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,890
What did this cost, uh, uh,

230
00:12:59,891 --> 00:13:04,891
what will be the longterm consequences
down the road beyond the immediate ones

231
00:13:05,021 --> 00:13:08,060
that, that everyone can
see. So it's just a,

232
00:13:08,061 --> 00:13:10,840
it's just a consistency and asking
those questions. You know, it's funny,

233
00:13:10,841 --> 00:13:14,740
as you're answering the question,
it keeps making me think, well,

234
00:13:14,741 --> 00:13:18,730
this shows you why politics is so
screwed up because they get up,

235
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:22,330
they're all politicians on either side
and they either say $15 minimum wage,

236
00:13:22,331 --> 00:13:25,840
Bernie or Trump, I'm going to cut
taxes on you. Or they, you know,

237
00:13:25,841 --> 00:13:27,580
they love their bumper stickers stuff,

238
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:31,690
but nobody's ever said unintended
consequences in a presidential debate.

239
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:36,430
So how frustrating must that be as an
economist listening to people who are not

240
00:13:36,431 --> 00:13:38,950
economists, who really aren't
experts in much of anything.

241
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,130
I don't know that Bernie has ever
created a business or made anyone make a

242
00:13:42,131 --> 00:13:44,930
dollar off,
am not aware of it overnight.

243
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,250
But that must be incredibly
frustrating to hear.

244
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:53,330
Non Pros talk about the things that
you're a pro at. It is David and,

245
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,620
and you know, it's especially frustrating
about it. It's not rocket science.

246
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:59,590
I mean, I, I, I love economics.

247
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:04,120
I love my profession and I really
admire the best among my professional

248
00:14:04,121 --> 00:14:08,230
colleagues, Milton Freeman High Tech.
Uh, but it's not rocket science.

249
00:14:08,231 --> 00:14:13,231
It's just this consistency of always
understanding that there are consequences

250
00:14:14,171 --> 00:14:17,340
beyond the immediate, uh, that,

251
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:21,190
that there's always a cost to something,
uh,

252
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,410
that no matter how
beneficial something is,

253
00:14:23,411 --> 00:14:27,840
it has to be weighed against
that cost. So these simple, uh,

254
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,560
the simple understanding
and the consistency in
applying that understanding,

255
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:37,300
it's not difficult, but so few people
do it. So it is, it is frustrating.

256
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,300
Um, you know, years ago I stopped,

257
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:43,180
I joke that I stopped
watching the evening.

258
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:46,780
People my age used to watch the evening.
Even the news, right. I remember it.

259
00:14:46,781 --> 00:14:50,400
I have some recollection again, I had
to stop watching the news have always,

260
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:54,530
always threatened. Throw my shoes.
Yeah. Through the, through the screen.

261
00:14:54,531 --> 00:14:57,590
Because you know, the, the
reporters, they would very,

262
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:00,800
very much like the politicians. They
would report on the immediate effect, Oh,

263
00:15:00,801 --> 00:15:04,640
the minimum wage is going arise that that
means that workers will get a raise of,

264
00:15:04,641 --> 00:15:07,220
you know, whatever the amount is
as well. Well, no, it does it,

265
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,720
it means that for some workers,

266
00:15:08,721 --> 00:15:12,410
but it means also other workers are
going to lose their jobs. Some jobs,

267
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,240
the nature of those jobs
are going to change.

268
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:15,860
Employers aren't just
going to sit back and say,

269
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,800
oh well we've got to pay
higher minimum wages,

270
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:20,000
so let's just pay higher than minimum
wage. Where's that money coming from?

271
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:22,970
Where are those resources coming from?
They have to come from somewhere. Yeah.

272
00:15:22,971 --> 00:15:26,660
So basically your argument would be
that the government's only role in the

273
00:15:26,661 --> 00:15:30,590
economy is to make sure we're not killing
each other. They're pretty much right.

274
00:15:30,591 --> 00:15:34,550
Like it really it's a total
laissez faire at if, yes,

275
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,320
I am a very laissez faire guy.
If,

276
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,950
if property rights are
well defined and secure,

277
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:45,610
and there's a strong case that government
plays a role of Ken play a role in

278
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:50,480
helping to define and certainly
helping to secure property rights.

279
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,430
So that's where you're going.
Contract rights. Right?

280
00:15:52,431 --> 00:15:55,070
So that's where you're not in anarcho
capitalists. Right? Well, I'm going,

281
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:58,400
I'm close to being here. I
mean, I, I'm, I'm willing,

282
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,880
I'm willing to admit that grudgingly
giving that to the governor. I'm willing.

283
00:16:01,881 --> 00:16:06,530
Yes. I'm willing to admit
that anarcho capitalism, you
know, might not be, uh, uh,

284
00:16:06,531 --> 00:16:09,260
ultimately a defensible position.

285
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:14,350
I am not willing to admit that free
markets are an indefensible position.

286
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,730
However, property rights come to be,
however, they are defined, however,

287
00:16:19,731 --> 00:16:24,731
they are enforced when you have secure
private property rights and freedom of

288
00:16:25,701 --> 00:16:29,630
contract, which includes importantly
the freedom to say no. All right,

289
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,060
I the freedom to not contract.
Uh,

290
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:37,450
then people are led to pursue their
people in pursuing their own interest,

291
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:40,460
are obliged to help others out.

292
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:45,380
And that's how this great society that
we live in and it is great, uh, uh,

293
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,380
continues to grow and become
more prosperous. Yeah.

294
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:51,320
So I mentioned to you right
before we started that, you know,

295
00:16:51,321 --> 00:16:54,020
I've had a political awakening of
sorts and I always say to people,

296
00:16:54,021 --> 00:16:56,840
I didn't really move,
but the left went so bananas.

297
00:16:56,841 --> 00:17:00,110
I ended up being friends with all these
Libertarians and conservatives and

298
00:17:00,111 --> 00:17:02,750
whatever, whatever it is, even
for the differences we may have.

299
00:17:02,751 --> 00:17:07,250
But one place I have shifted is that I
am much more where you are economically

300
00:17:07,251 --> 00:17:07,460
now.

301
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:12,230
And partly that's because I now run my
own business and have employees and have

302
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,160
to deal with that.

303
00:17:13,161 --> 00:17:17,720
And I just wrote to obscene Lehigh
checks for taxes for the year. I mean,

304
00:17:17,721 --> 00:17:19,790
we are in California.
You don't want to know him like that one.

305
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:22,160
It wasn't the federal loans even
worse than it's like you're,

306
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:26,390
the more successful I get, the harder I
work, the more they want to take from you.

307
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,960
And I tweeted something about that on
tax day and a lot of people were angry at

308
00:17:29,961 --> 00:17:33,740
me and said, well it's, it's, this
is the price to pay for success.

309
00:17:33,741 --> 00:17:34,970
Would you rather be poor?

310
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,930
And I didn't want to go on
a major tweetstorm and you
wisely or not on Twitter,

311
00:17:38,931 --> 00:17:40,940
but could you,
could you give me something that,

312
00:17:40,941 --> 00:17:42,290
if I ever get in that fight again,

313
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:45,710
I can say to people why that's not the
right way to think. So let, let, let,

314
00:17:45,711 --> 00:17:46,940
let me start off though
with just asking you,

315
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:50,880
have you heard the story about George
Mcgovern when he retired from politics?

316
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:54,990
He a big snow please. So George
Mcgovern, when he retired from politics,

317
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:58,820
I think I have the details right. He
certainly had the, the major part of it,

318
00:17:58,821 --> 00:18:03,210
right? He started the B and B, uh,
you know, in, in, in his home state.

319
00:18:03,211 --> 00:18:05,950
You already like where this
is going. Yeah. And uh,

320
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:10,260
and then he encounters all these
regulations, you know, labor regulations,

321
00:18:10,261 --> 00:18:13,770
safety regulations. Uh, and he admits,

322
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,100
I can't remember now to whom he admitted
as a long time ago. Yeah. He admits,

323
00:18:17,101 --> 00:18:19,320
he says, you don't have to spend
all my, I'm not quoting him,

324
00:18:19,321 --> 00:18:24,060
I'm going from memory. So I spent all
my life pushing for these things. I was,

325
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:29,000
I wasn't sufficiently attentive
to the downside of, of, of,

326
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:33,720
of these taxes and these regulations.
Yeah. And so it's easy to, you know,

327
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:38,130
to sit here in Sacramento to sit
in Washington DC to sit in some,

328
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,400
you know, local government, uh,

329
00:18:40,401 --> 00:18:45,000
office building and tell other people
how to live and to tell other people how

330
00:18:45,001 --> 00:18:46,950
much money they have to give to you.

331
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,010
And you can be well intentioned
in the best sense of the term,

332
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,320
but you are not those other people.

333
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:56,230
And those other people are
bearing consequences and
they know of things that you

334
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,180
don't understand. And so on, on the,
on the, on the, on the tax thing.

335
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:05,790
Uh, I like what, uh, uh, my
friend Ed Crane said about, uh,

336
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:10,800
the famous quotation that is above the
door of the IRS building in Washington.

337
00:19:10,801 --> 00:19:15,180
It's a quotation from justice
Oliver Wendell Holmes who said,

338
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,560
I think there's an exact quotation.

339
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:19,950
Taxation is the price you pay for
civilization. And at crane says, no,

340
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,540
that's wrong. Taxation is the price we
pay for being insufficiently civil law.

341
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,570
Right?
That's a civilization is,

342
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:32,150
is when we cooperate peacefully to
help each other. And so even if we,

343
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,950
granted there is some role for government
and once you're granted some role for

344
00:19:34,951 --> 00:19:35,560
government,
it's hard.

345
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:39,990
It's very difficult to not see that
there's some appropriate level of taxation

346
00:19:39,991 --> 00:19:42,480
to fund that role for government.
Uh,

347
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,420
Ho Ho were much that may
be true that we need,

348
00:19:45,421 --> 00:19:50,160
that it represents a failure of us as
a society to become fully civilized.

349
00:19:50,161 --> 00:19:53,940
We've somehow not managed to figure
out how to cooperate peacefully and

350
00:19:53,941 --> 00:19:58,941
voluntarily in those matters in ways
that we have managed to discover how to

351
00:19:58,951 --> 00:20:01,800
cooperate peacefully in voluntarily and
doing what we're doing here today and

352
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:05,340
going to the supermarket
and the supermarket dealing
with the various, uh, uh,

353
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:09,790
suppliers that, that it has. None
of that is, is funded with taxation.

354
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:13,920
So all funded with voluntary voluntary
payments. That is civilization.

355
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:18,580
So I liked the notion that, uh,
uh, taxation is, uh, it's a,

356
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,560
it's sort of a measure of how little we
are civilized or how far we have to go

357
00:20:22,561 --> 00:20:25,670
to be completely civilized to make sure
we're not killing each other to make

358
00:20:25,671 --> 00:20:28,650
sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, all right.

359
00:20:28,651 --> 00:20:30,930
I want to get back to a couple of
things you said there. So first, okay.

360
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:33,600
I know the, I know that the minimum
wage is a, is a big one for you.

361
00:20:33,601 --> 00:20:34,640
And even just this morning,

362
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,680
I write another story about how
Bernie wants this $15 minimum wage.

363
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,280
The anecdote that I keep using or
anecdote that I keep using is that I keep

364
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:41,521
trying,

365
00:20:41,521 --> 00:20:45,810
I'm traveling all over the country right
now and in almost every airport you go

366
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:50,440
to fast food places and they don't have
people anymore. They have I iPads. Yes.

367
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:54,520
Now perhaps if you could pay people less,
people would have jobs.

368
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:56,170
It wouldn't be the
greatest job in the world,

369
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,730
but it would be the
way it's always worked.

370
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:01,960
Now we are literally replacing people
with robots that may be inevitable no

371
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:05,890
matter what. But to say that
you have to pay people again,

372
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,330
even from my own business here,

373
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,670
I get people offering to work
for me for free all the time.

374
00:21:09,671 --> 00:21:13,650
I want to pay people appropriately
and we do pay all our people. Um,

375
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:17,980
but the idea that the government would
force me to pay someone x amount,

376
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:22,360
it seems completely bananas.
So the minimum wage, uh,

377
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:26,290
puts low many low skill
workers out of jobs. If,

378
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:31,380
if a teenager is not worth
$7 and 25 cents per hour,

379
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,080
employers who are not in the charity
business are not going to hire that

380
00:21:35,081 --> 00:21:36,310
teenager at that price.

381
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:39,490
That teenager will go without a
job or go without a job in the,

382
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:42,520
in the above ground economy,
make find a job,

383
00:21:42,521 --> 00:21:47,240
paying more in the underground economy,
which is a different set of problems. Uh,

384
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:51,010
and so that is the major unintended
consequence of the minimum wage.

385
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:55,690
There are others, but that's
the big one. Um, and if,

386
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:58,070
uh, you know what, people
like Bernie Sanders, I mean,

387
00:21:58,071 --> 00:22:02,060
because I speak to proponents of
the minimum wage all the time, uh,

388
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:04,960
most of them, uh, do,

389
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:09,220
they just stopped the
analysis at the surface. Oh,

390
00:22:09,221 --> 00:22:12,520
wouldn't it be better to be paid $15
an hour and said simple? Of course.

391
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:16,720
So this is, they don't want to get to the
unintended consequences part, I think,

392
00:22:16,721 --> 00:22:21,640
because I think because most of them
believe that they just have this image of

393
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:25,720
employers as being a really rich,
uh,

394
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:30,670
highly profitable operations. And so if
you raise the minimum wage, oh, sure.

395
00:22:30,671 --> 00:22:34,060
It has a cost, but cost that's going
to be born exclusively by employers.

396
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:39,070
But it's a fact. Most low skilled workers
work in highly competitive industries.

397
00:22:39,071 --> 00:22:43,950
They work in food retail, they, they
work at lawn care. They, they, they,

398
00:22:43,951 --> 00:22:46,960
they work in, in, in, in
supermarkets, restaurants.

399
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:50,800
These are highly competitive industries.
So there's no big profit margin there.

400
00:22:50,801 --> 00:22:52,120
So when you raise the minimum wage,

401
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:54,280
it's not coming out of the
profits of the employers.

402
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:58,600
It has to come out of some change in
the way the employers do their business.

403
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,480
There's nothing wrong with automation
of course. Yeah. But there's a,

404
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,560
there's a proper amount of automation
and if you raise the minimum wage,

405
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:08,040
you get too much automation,
uh,

406
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:12,820
because you put a and too few
human workers. And here, here's,

407
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,260
I just want to make this clear.

408
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:17,020
Here's another unintended
consequences of the minimum wage.

409
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:22,250
And not only does it deny income to those
workers who will lose their jobs worse

410
00:23:22,481 --> 00:23:27,220
in most cases, it denies those
workers. W what's even more valuable,

411
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:31,150
namely the opportunity to get that
first piece of job experience.

412
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,660
And so the 16 year old who otherwise
would have gotten the job without the

413
00:23:34,661 --> 00:23:39,661
minimum wage becomes a 17 year old or
18 year old who's still a never employed

414
00:23:39,701 --> 00:23:43,960
person. Whereas otherwise they would have
had job experience. And so it, it, it,

415
00:23:43,961 --> 00:23:48,370
it swells artificially swells
the ranks of, of, of, uh,

416
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,280
unskilled workers.

417
00:23:49,281 --> 00:23:52,820
Would there be a direct correlation then
that once you have this whole set of

418
00:23:52,821 --> 00:23:54,980
people at this imaginary $15 minimum wage,

419
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,390
they are also going to raise prices
on basic things, right? I mean is,

420
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,870
is there a direct correlation that no
mean prices may rise a little bit cause

421
00:24:02,871 --> 00:24:03,500
you get it,
you know,

422
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,800
the economy's a little bit less efficient
so you get a little bit less output,

423
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:10,760
but the price increases aren't,
aren't the, the major problem.

424
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,760
The major problem is employers will
find ways to satisfy their customers,

425
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:18,920
uh,
at slightly higher cost to the employers,

426
00:24:18,921 --> 00:24:22,640
but at huge costs to those workers who,
who lose their jobs.

427
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:26,690
So when you've talked to kind of missed
on the left that disagree with you on

428
00:24:26,691 --> 00:24:29,150
this and I, I get what you're saying
that they're not taking that next step.

429
00:24:29,151 --> 00:24:32,600
I'm sure there's someone out there that
has made a sound argument that you just

430
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:34,370
disagree with you lay out.

431
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:38,810
So there is one sound argument,
one sound,

432
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:43,350
theoretically one theoretically coherent
argument for the minimum wage to

433
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:43,910
measure that one.

434
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:48,910
And that is if employers have
what's called monopsony power vent,

435
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,430
which I'm going to need to define
that one. Yes. Monopsony power is,

436
00:24:52,431 --> 00:24:55,890
it's like monopoly power,
except so monopolist is the
only seller. A monopsony.

437
00:24:55,891 --> 00:24:57,440
It's is the only buyer.
Okay?

438
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:02,350
So if you're the only buyer of low
skill workers in the market, right?

439
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:06,020
But you as an employer, you then
can, and it can be easily shown,

440
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:10,220
you can keep wages lower than
they would otherwise be too low.

441
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,110
And given that you,

442
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:15,230
it can be then shown that
if the government comes in
and sets a minimum wage,

443
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,660
right, then the, uh,

444
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,720
the employer will in fact pay the higher
minimum wage and no employees will be

445
00:25:23,601 --> 00:25:27,240
harmed. But it's a very, very, uh,

446
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:31,160
strict criteria for this are very,
very strict.

447
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:36,430
And the idea that that Walmart and
Mcdonald's and Burger King and KFC and all

448
00:25:37,521 --> 00:25:39,790
the mom and pop restaurants and,
and,

449
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,760
and made services and lawn care services
that we have throughout the United

450
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:43,820
States,

451
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:48,820
the idea that any one of these is a
month alone monopoly buyer of low skill

452
00:25:49,971 --> 00:25:51,350
workers is just absurd.
