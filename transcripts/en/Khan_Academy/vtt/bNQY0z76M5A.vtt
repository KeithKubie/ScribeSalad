00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.930
In this video, I'm going to show
you a technique called

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:09.310
completing the square.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:14.490
And what's neat about this is
that this will work for any

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.210
quadratic equation, and it's
actually the basis for the

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.750
quadratic formula.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.990
And in the next video or the
video after that I'll prove

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.630
the quadratic formula using
completing the square.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.450
But before we do that, we
need to understand even

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:29.470
what it's all about.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.070
And it really just builds off
of what we did in the last

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.880
video, where we solved
quadratics

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.130
using perfect squares.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.900
So let's say I have the
quadratic equation x squared

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.880
minus 4x is equal to 5.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.490
And I put this big space
here for a reason.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.680
In the last video, we saw
that these can be pretty

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.200
straightforward to solve if
the left-hand side is a

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.500
perfect square.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.050
You see, completing the square
is all about making the

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.900
quadratic equation into a
perfect square, engineering

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.190
it, adding and subtracting from
both sides so it becomes

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:05.970
a perfect square.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.710
So how can we do that?

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.130
Well, in order for this
left-hand side to be a perfect

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.990
square, there has to be
some number here.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.510
There has to be some number here
that if I have my number

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.910
squared I get that number, and
then if I have two times my

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.890
number I get negative 4.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.750
Remember that, and I
think it'll become

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.700
clear with a few examples.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:35.230
I want x squared minus 4x plus
something to be equal to x

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.740
minus a squared.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.010
We don't know what a
is just yet, but we

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.110
know a couple of things.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.180
When I square things-- so this
is going to be x squared minus

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.330
2a plus a squared.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.640
So if you look at this pattern
right here, that has to be--

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.880
sorry, x squared minus 2ax--
this right here has to be 2ax.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.530
And this right here would
have to be a squared.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.690
So this number, a is going to
be half of negative 4, a has

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.370
to be negative 2, right?

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.570
Because 2 times a is going
to be negative 4.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.330
a is negative 2, and if a is
negative 2, what is a squared?

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.550
Well, then a squared is going
to be positive 4.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.220
And this might look all
complicated to you right now,

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.910
but I'm showing you
the rationale.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.080
You literally just look at this
coefficient right here,

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.670
and you say, OK, well what's
half of that coefficient?

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.920
Well, half of that coefficient
is negative 2.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.230
So we could say a is equal to
negative 2-- same idea there--

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.720
and then you square it.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.100
You square a, you
get positive 4.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.540
So we add positive 4 here.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.630
Add a 4.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.990
Now, from the very first
equation we ever did, you

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.240
should know that you can never
do something to just one side

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.900
of the equation.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.700
You can't add 4 to just one
side of the equation.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.710
If x squared minus 4x was equal
to 5, then when I add 4

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.720
it's not going to be
equal to 5 anymore.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.950
It's going to be equal
to 5 plus 4.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.430
We added 4 on the left-hand side
because we wanted this to

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.435
be a perfect square.

00:03:12.435 --> 00:03:15.210
But if you add something to the
left-hand side, you've got

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.320
to add it to the right-hand
side.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.630
And now, we've gotten ourselves
to a problem that's

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.410
just like the problems we
did in the last video.

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.960
What is this left-hand side?

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.000
Let me rewrite the
whole thing.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.020
We have x squared minus 4x
plus 4 is equal to 9 now.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.380
All we did is add 4 to both
sides of the equation.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.070
But we added 4 on purpose so
that this left-hand side

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.080
becomes a perfect square.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.760
Now what is this?

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.340
What number when I multiply it
by itself is equal to 4 and

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.770
when I add it to itself I'm
equal to negative 2?

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.000
Well, we already answered
that question.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.040
It's negative 2.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.310
So we get x minus 2 times
x minus 2 is equal to 9.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.350
Or we could have skipped this
step and written x minus 2

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.990
squared is equal to 9.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.280
And then you take the square
root of both sides, you get x

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.840
minus 2 is equal to
plus or minus 3.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.870
Add 2 to both sides, you get x
is equal to 2 plus or minus 3.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.440
That tells us that x could be
equal to 2 plus 3, which is 5.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:28.960
Or x could be equal to 2 minus
3, which is negative 1.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.650
And we are done.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:31.840
Now I want to be very clear.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.300
You could have done this without
completing the square.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.640
We could've started off
with x squared minus

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.850
4x is equal to 5.

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.970
We could have subtracted 5 from
both sides and gotten x

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.160
squared minus 4x minus
5 is equal to 0.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.940
And you could say, hey, if I
have a negative 5 times a

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.190
positive 1, then their product
is negative 5 and their sum is

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.000
negative 4.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.800
So I could say this is x
minus 5 times x plus

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.480
1 is equal to 0.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.810
And then we would say that x is
equal to 5 or x is equal to

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:07.700
negative 1.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.350
And in this case, this actually
probably would have

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.450
been a faster way to
do the problem.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.140
But the neat thing about the
completing the square is it

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.770
will always work.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.580
It'll always work no matter what
the coefficients are or

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.385
no matter how crazy
the problem is.

00:05:23.385 --> 00:05:25.400
And let me prove it to you.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.440
Let's do one that traditionally
would have been

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.140
a pretty painful problem if
we just tried to do it by

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:36.200
factoring, especially if we
did it using grouping or

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.020
something like that.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:45.070
Let's say we had 10x squared
minus 30x minus

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.530
8 is equal to 0.

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.060
Now, right from the get-go, you
could say, hey look, we

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.280
could maybe divide
both sides by 2.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.800
That does simplify
a little bit.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.450
Let's divide both sides by 2.

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:02.150
So if you divide everything
by 2, what do you get?

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:11.990
We get 5x squared minus 15x
minus 4 is equal to 0.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.540
But once again, now we have this
crazy 5 in front of this

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.810
coefficent and we would have to
solve it by grouping which

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.410
is a reasonably painful
process.

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.410
But we can now go straight to
completing the square, and to

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.500
do that I'm now going to divide
by 5 to get a 1 leading

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.870
coefficient here.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.660
And you're going to see why this
is different than what

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.010
we've traditionally done.

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.730
So if I divide this whole thing
by 5, I could have just

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:38.050
divided by 10 from the get-go
but I wanted to go to this the

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.030
step first just to show
you that this really

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.800
didn't give us much.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.660
Let's divide everything by 5.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:52.693
So if you divide everything by
5, you get x squared minus 3x

00:06:52.693 --> 00:06:58.720
minus 4/5 is equal to 0.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.020
So, you might say, hey, why did
we ever do that factoring

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:02.630
by grouping?

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.140
If we can just always divide by
this leading coefficient,

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:07.220
we can get rid of that.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.840
We can always turn this into a 1
or a negative 1 if we divide

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:10.910
by the right number.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:14.410
But notice, by doing that we
got this crazy 4/5 here.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:17.630
So this is super hard to do
just using factoring.

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.500
You'd have to say, what two
numbers when I take the

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.100
product is equal to
negative 4/5?

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.210
It's a fraction and when I take
their sum, is equal to

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:26.140
negative 3?

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:29.310
This is a hard problem
with factoring.

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:36.860
This is hard using factoring.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:42.080
So, the best thing to do is to
use completing the square.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.720
So let's think a little bit
about how we can turn this

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.950
into a perfect square.

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:48.080
What I like to do-- and you'll
see this done some ways and

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.040
I'll show you both ways because
you'll see teachers do

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.880
it both ways-- I like to get
the 4/5 on the other side.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.900
So let's add 4/5 to both
sides of this equation.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.980
You don't have to do it this
way, but I like to get the 4/5

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.160
out of the way.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.010
And then what do we get
if we add 4/5 to both

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:05.250
sides of this equation?

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:08.350
The left-hand hand side of the
equation just becomes x

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:11.800
squared minus 3x,
no 4/5 there.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.660
I'm going to leave a little
bit of space.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.790
And that's going to
be equal to 4/5.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:19.990
Now, just like the last problem,
we want to turn this

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:23.350
left-hand side into the perfect
square of a binomial.

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:24.740
How do we do that?

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:28.360
Well, we say, well, what number
times 2 is equal to

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.110
negative 3?

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:32.309
So some number times
2 is negative 3.

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:35.330
Or we essentially just take
negative 3 and divide it by 2,

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.370
which is negative 3/2.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:39.554
And then we square
negative 3/2.

00:08:39.554 --> 00:08:44.840
So in the example, we'll
say a is negative 3/2.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.380
And if we square negative
3/2, what do we get?

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:54.100
We get positive 9/4.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.810
I just took half of this
coefficient, squared it, got

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:58.010
positive 9/4.

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:00.720
The whole purpose of doing that
is to turn this left-hand

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.920
side into a perfect square.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.530
Now, anything you do to one side
of the equation, you've

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:06.600
got to do to the other side.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:11.030
So we added a 9/4 here, let's
add a 9/4 over there.

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:13.850
And what does our
equation become?

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:22.530
We get x squared minus 3x plus
9/4 is equal to-- let's see if

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:24.460
we can get a common
denominator.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:29.120
So, 4/5 is the same
thing as 16/20.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.880
Just multiply the numerator
and denominator by 4.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.820
Plus over 20.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.960
9/4 is the same thing
if you multiply the

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:42.150
numerator by 5 as 45/20.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:44.970
And so what is 16 plus 45?

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:47.020
You see, this is kind of getting
kind of hairy, but

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.930
that's the fun, I guess, of

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:50.380
completing the square sometimes.

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.420
16 plus 45.

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:55.780
See that's 55, 61.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:59.750
So this is equal to 61/20.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:02.680
So let me just rewrite it.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:09.480
x squared minus 3x plus
9/4 is equal to 61/20.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.030
Crazy number.

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:13.630
Now this, at least on
the left hand side,

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:15.970
is a perfect square.

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:21.610
This is the same thing as
x minus 3/2 squared.

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:24.200
And it was by design.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:27.590
Negative 3/2 times negative
3/2 is positive 9/4.

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:32.790
Negative 3/2 plus negative 3/2
is equal to negative 3.

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:37.960
So this squared is
equal to 61/20.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:43.090
We can take the square root of
both sides and we get x minus

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:47.820
3/2 is equal to the positive
or the negative

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:53.320
square root of 61/20.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:57.640
And now, we can add 3/2 to both
sides of this equation

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:03.600
and you get x is equal to
positive 3/2 plus or minus the

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:07.300
square root of 61/20.

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.290
And this is a crazy number and
it's hopefully obvious you

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:11.430
would not have been able to-- at
least I would not have been

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:15.250
able to-- get to this number
just by factoring.

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:17.260
And if you want their actual
values, you can get your

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:18.510
calculator out.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.510
And then let me clear
all of this.

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:28.760
And 3/2-- let's do the plus
version first. So we want to

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:33.710
do 3 divided by 2 plus the
second square root.

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:35.050
We want to pick that little
yellow square root.

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:46.480
So the square root of 61 divided
by 20, which is 3.24.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:52.760
This crazy 3.2464, I'll
just write 3.246.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:12:02.230
So this is approximately equal
to 3.246, and that was just

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:03.110
the positive version.

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:06.710
Let's do the subtraction
version.

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:09.180
So we can actually put our
entry-- if you do second and

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:11.535
then entry, that we want that
little yellow entry, that's

00:12:11.535 --> 00:12:12.465
why I pressed the
second button.

00:12:12.465 --> 00:12:16.130
So I press enter, it puts in
what we just put, we can just

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:23.400
change the positive or the
addition to a subtraction and

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:27.970
you get negative 0.246.

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:33.800
So you get negative 0.246.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:38.200
And you can actually verify
that these satisfy our

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.360
original equation.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.050
Our original equation
was up here.

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:43.840
Let me just verify
for one of them.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.130
So the second answer on your
graphing calculator is the

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:51.760
last answer you use.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.160
So if you use a variable answer,
that's this number

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.160
right here.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:13:00.090
So if I have my answer squared--
I'm using answer

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:02.380
represents negative 0.24.

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:11.975
Answer squared minus 3 times
answer minus 4/5-- 4 divided

00:13:11.975 --> 00:13:16.030
by 5-- it equals--.

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:18.490
And this just a little
bit of explanation.

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:21.860
This doesn't store the entire
number, it goes up to some

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:22.880
level of precision.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.910
It stores some number
of digits.

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:28.930
So when it calculated it using
this stored number right here,

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:32.240
it got 1 times 10 to
the negative 14.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.980
So that is 0.0000.

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:37.100
So that's 13 zeroes
and then a 1.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:38.870
A decimal, then 13
zeroes and a 1.

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:41.060
So this is pretty much 0.

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.550
Or actually, if you got the
exact answer right here, if

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:46.480
you went through an infinite
level of precision here, or

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.050
maybe if you kept it in this
radical form, you would get

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:52.390
that it is indeed equal to 0.

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:55.300
So hopefully you found that
helpful, this whole notion of

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:56.160
completing the square.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.670
Now we're going to extend it
to the actual quadratic

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:01.510
formula that we can use, we
can essentially just plug

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:03.610
things into to solve any
quadratic equation.
