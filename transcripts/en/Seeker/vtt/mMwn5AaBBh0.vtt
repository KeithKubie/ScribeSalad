00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.359
Eat right, exercise, don't watch too much
TV, keep your brain healthy, don't smoke,

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:09.000
don't drink too much, don't drink too little…
advice for prolonging life is everywhere,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.860
but maybe you're not living wrong, you're
just living in the wrong place.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.300
Sup cotton-top wannabes, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.860
Getting older is inevitable and in some places
the drudgery of aging is as apparent as grey

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.630
clouds rolling over a sunny day, but that's
not always the case.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.590
In his 2011 book, "The Blue Zones" Dan Buettner
used census data to find the regions of the

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.710
world where people live the longest -- Okinawa,
Japan; Sardinia, Italy; Loma Linda, California;

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.449
the Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica… he called
these areas Blue Zones.

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:50.030
Living in each of these "zones" have mysterious
benefits: Okinawa boasts the longest disability-free

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.980
life-expectancy, and Nicoya Peninsula residents
have four-times the chance of reaching age

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.670
90 than the average American!

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.809
The research is a collection of case studies
on these areas, but according to an Indian

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.320
Journal of Community Medicine review, all
four of these geographically disparate "zones"

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.550
have common threads.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.300
The big takeaways: Low-intensity physical
activity; building good relationships; Eating

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.940
a diet lighter on meat and excess calories
and heavier on plants; and Finding a purpose

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.070
for and sense of meaning in your life.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.000
The lifestyles in each of the areas forced
senior citizens to live in such a way that

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.700
they got all these benefits.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.670
For example, Buettner told NPR, "Okinawans
sat on the floor; Sardinians lived in vertical

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.920
houses," et cetera, keeping them mildly-active
all the time.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.860
Okinawans eat 300 grams of vegetables a day
and practice hara hachi bu, they never eat

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.960
to more than 80 percent full.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.960
And each group keeps up their involvement
in their community!

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.580
The Sardinians value advice and regular communication
with their elders.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.270
And even the little things matter, like Costa
Ricans build a garden year after year…

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.580
giving structure, purpose and meaning to their
lives!

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.120
Not everyone in Blue Zones run marathons or
hits the gym every day, but they do maintain

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.100
this low-level healthy lifestyle with activity
and social involvement, and tons of scientific

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.060
studies support that strategy!

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.659
Honestly, it sounds lovely.

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:13.799
But c'mon, where's the HARD SCIENCE?

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:18.099
Firstly, diets with low levels of meat intake,
and high levels of vegetables are all supported

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.769
by tons of research as the healthiest choices,
but you should also eat nuts, berries, and

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.120
some complex carbs.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.069
The Mediterranean diet, practiced by the Sardinians,
is exactly that -- and studies show it decreases

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.319
instances of cardiovascular disease and cancer
and increases longevity.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.719
But it's not just diet.

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:40.129
According to a review in Science, study after
study finds people who are happier live longer,

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:41.629
and have better health.

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.940
In one, people who were happier lived almost
seven years longer -- and presumably, they

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.829
were happy to do so!

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.969
And staying happy is heavily connected to
our social well-being.

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:57.230
A meta-study in PLos Medicine of 308,000 people
found: relationships with friends help us

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.890
deal with stress, encourage healthy behaviors,
influence us to take better care of ourselves,

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.420
and provide meaning to our lives!

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.340
And that, the study found, had a measurable
effect on longevity.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.140
Separately, studies of the Okinawan specifically,
found a rare genetic phenotype exists there

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.360
at twice the rate of other populations.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.090
These genes may affect cardiovascular functions,
insulin signaling, immunoinflammatory response,

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.639
and stress resistance; dramatically increasing
their longevity.

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:28.939
Studies throughout scientific literature find
that living like these people can help all

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:31.249
humans create long, happy lives.

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:36.090
And they’ve shown that longevity is a combination
of genetic, social and environmental factors!

00:03:36.090 --> 00:04:09.920
Point being, you don't have to live in these
places to get these benefits.
