00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.650
So I have six
different expressions

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.630
here, and what I want you
to do is pause this video

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.850
and try to calculate the value
of each of these expressions.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:11.660
I'm assuming you've
given a go at it.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.132
Now let's work through them.

00:00:13.132 --> 00:00:14.590
So when we see
something like this,

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.423
we have to remember our
order of operations.

00:00:16.423 --> 00:00:18.460
We have 2 times
3 squared, and we

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.140
have to remember that the
first thing we would need

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.460
to think about are
the parentheses.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.030
I'll just write paren for short.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.366
Then we worry about exponents.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.290
Then we will worry about
multiplication and division,

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.975
and actually let me
write it this way.

00:00:36.975 --> 00:00:40.190
We worry about
multiplication and division.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.697
And then we worry about
addition and subtraction.

00:00:43.697 --> 00:00:45.280
So in this expression
right over here,

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.640
there are no parentheses, so
we do the exponents first.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.090
So we calculate
what 3 squared is.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.840
3 times 3 is 9, so
this becomes 2 times 9,

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.657
which is equal to 18.

00:00:59.657 --> 00:01:01.990
Now let's look at this one,
and this one is interesting,

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.879
because they have-- it looks
like the same expression,

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.610
but now there are parentheses.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.590
And because of
these parentheses,

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.090
we're going to do
the multiplication

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.540
before we take the exponent.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.200
So 2 times 3 is going
to be 6, and we're

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.440
going to take that
to the second power.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.350
So that's 6 times 6,
which is equal to 36.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.520
Now let's think about
this one right over here.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.630
Once again, we want to do our
multiplication and our division

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.310
first.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.110
So we have a division
right over here.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.240
81/9 is the same thing
as 81 divided by 9,

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.380
and that's going to be 9.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.950
And then we have-- so it
becomes 1 plus 5 times 9.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.140
Now we want to do the
multiplication before we

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.050
do the addition, so
we're going to do our 5

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.410
times 9, which is 45.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:59.940
So this becomes 1 plus 45,
which of course is equal to 46.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.020
Now let's tackle this
one right over here.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.150
So, we would want to
do the exponents first.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.230
So, 1 squared, well
that's just going--

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:10.729
let me do this in
a different color.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.930
1 squared is just
going to be equal to 1,

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.370
so that's just going
to be equal to 1.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.980
And so you have
2 times 4 plus 1.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:19.820
What should you do?

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.986
Should you add first or do
the multiplication first?

00:02:21.986 --> 00:02:25.240
Well multiplication takes
precedence over addition,

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.230
so you're going to do
the 2 times 4 first.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.950
2 times 4 is 8, so
you're going to have

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.850
8 plus 1, which of
course is equal to 9.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.760
Now you have a very
similar expression,

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.120
but you have parentheses.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.620
So that's going to force you
to do what's in the parentheses

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.909
before you take the exponent.

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:46.950
But within the parentheses
we have multiplication

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.320
and addition, and
we have to remember

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.990
that we do the
multiplication first.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.480
So we're going to
do the 2 times 4

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.880
first, so that's going to be
8 plus 1 to the second power.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.370
8 plus 1 is 9, so that's
9 to the second power.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.671
9 squared is the same thing as
9 times 9, which is equal to 81.

00:03:09.671 --> 00:03:11.170
Now we have one
more right over here

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.400
that looks very
similar to this one,

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.350
except, once again, we
have parentheses that's

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.855
making us do the addition first.

00:03:15.855 --> 00:03:17.980
Without parentheses, we
would do the multiplication

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.850
and the division first.

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.620
But here, we see
that 1 plus 5 is 6,

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.400
and then we have this
81/9, which is 9.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.100
So this simplifies to 6 times 9,
which of course is equal to 54.
