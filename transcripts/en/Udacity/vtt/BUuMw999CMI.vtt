00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.510
So far, we have been developing a StateChart to describe the behavior of,

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.110
of a clock radio.

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.950
Thus far, we have used seven concurrently executing machines to

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.200
model the radio's percepts.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.670
We have left some placeholders for

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.490
other machines we will need to complete the diagram.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.110
We have also left out the transitions for the time being.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.320
Let's begin to look at the events that can provide the impetus for

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.670
these transitions.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:28.490
Recall that an event is a spontaneous or instantaneous occurrence.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.590
That is, we're not concerned with its duration.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.810
It can communicate information such as if we

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.660
turned the dial what position are we turning the dial to.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.200
But that the state machines can be sensitive to those events taking place and

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.030
cause a change of state when they detect them.
