00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.740
Welcome back to Google
Developers Weekly

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.414
for February 18th, 2014.

00:00:10.414 --> 00:00:12.330
I'm Louis Gray, and this
is our highlight reel

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.579
of what's happening in the
world of Google Developers,

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:16.520
on the set and off.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.840
We start off our recap with
something really quick,

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.220
as in QUIC UDP
internet connections,

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.760
a next generation
transport which

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.930
aims to reduce
latency and much more.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.800
Web speed master
Ilya Grigorik helps

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.400
us learn how QUIC
works and tells

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.510
us what's around the corner
in this fast moving project.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.120
We then welcome back Jarek
Wilkiewicz to the studio

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.750
to talk Freebase, a free
and open knowledge graph

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.182
with millions of entities.

00:00:38.182 --> 00:00:39.640
Jarek and Dan
Brickley show you how

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.940
to experiment with
Freebase RDF data using

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.470
a prepackaged
distribution created

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.020
by Sindice Technologies.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.720
Watch the event
and grab the image

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.460
at sindicetech.com/freebase.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.510
We've entered Geotag with
a pair of Maps videos.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.434
The first comes from
Maps magician Mano Marks,

00:00:53.434 --> 00:00:55.600
who introduces two new
features found in Google Maps

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.300
SDK for iOS, gradient polylines
and reverse geocoding.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.790
Then we're joined by engineering
interns Emma Yeap and Iris

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.400
Uy, who talk about the
Heatmaps library, a great way

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.945
to visualize large amounts
of geospatial data.

00:01:06.945 --> 00:01:09.320
From New York, continuing his
crusade to bring all of you

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.940
coders a version 3 of
the YouTube data API,

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.709
Jeff Posnick is back, talking
about how quota is handled.

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:16.250
And should you want
to find out more,

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.870
you can always catch
up at youtube.com/dev.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.002
For the last five weeks,
we've hosted Chris Wilson,

00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:24.460
Sean Bennett, and Peter Lubbers
for the latest Office Hours

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.130
talking mobile web development
for the Udacity CS256 course.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.732
This week's event takes
on lessons 10 through 12.

00:01:30.732 --> 00:01:32.940
If you've missed it, we've
got more than CliffsNotes,

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.950
we've got everything for
your viewing pleasure.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.300
Felipe Hoffa from the
Cloud platform team hosted

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.782
Pearson's Director of Data
Science, Collin Sellman .

00:01:40.782 --> 00:01:42.990
The pair walked through how
Pearson uses data science

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.230
to improve education,
including Python and BigQuery.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.510
Peng Ying and Mihai Ionescu,
two of my favorite Walleteers,

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.460
then walk through the Wallet
Objects API C# Quickstart

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.440
sample.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.390
If you understood what that
meant, this show is for you.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.190
And we wrapped up our
studio work this week

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.815
with the latest from
the Cast team, who

00:01:59.815 --> 00:02:01.836
debuted the Cast
SDK for Android.

00:02:01.836 --> 00:02:03.460
This video gives an
introduction on how

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.770
to build Google Cast center
applications for Android

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.060
using the Google Cast SDK.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.930
There's lots of big news about
Google Cloud SQL this week.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.790
First, Cloud SQL graduated
to general availability

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.830
with databases up
to 500 gigabytes.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.920
Plus, data is now
automatically stored encrypted,

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.070
and there's a uptime
SLA of 99.95%.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.980
And finally, you know those
pages with infinite scroll?

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.880
Maybe your site even
has some of them.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.340
If so, you'll want
search engines

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.212
to crawl all that
infinite content.

00:02:30.212 --> 00:02:31.920
For the best technique
on how to do this,

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.560
check out this week's blog
post on Google Developers Blog
