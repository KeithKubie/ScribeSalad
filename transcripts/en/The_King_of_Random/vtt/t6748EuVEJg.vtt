00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.640
For this project I’m going to show you how
to make exploding tipped blow darts. Throw

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.530
them at a hard surface, and these little flyer
crackers explode on impact, making a startling

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.470
little bang as they do. You can throw them
by hand, or use them with the blowgun we made

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.570
in a previous project. But either way, these
quick and easy cap crackers, are sure to give

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.990
you a satisfying bang, for your buck.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.400
Let’s start this project with a pack of
ring caps, some paper snow-cone cups, and

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.089
#6 machine screws.

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:31.089
The screws I found are 2” long, and come
in a pack of 5 for about a dollar. And if

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:34.570
you got the same pack I did, you’ll find
5 hex nuts in there as well, which should

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.610
come in handy in just a minute.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.540
Ok let’s set a snow-cone on the table, pointy
side facing up, then tear off a small strip

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.450
of duct-tape. Stick the tape on the cone so
the edge is a little higher than the tip,

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.600
then wrap the ends around one at a time. I’m
using duct-tape because it will help reinforce

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.690
the paper, and make it a little more weather
resistant.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.060
Now if you don’t have paper snow-cones handy,
it’s no problem. You can always make your

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.250
own cones out of paper, or sticky notes, like
we did in the laser blowgun project.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.540
Ok, let’s push the tip of the cone into
a piece of 1/2” PVC tubing, and you’ll

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.570
see the edges mark a little indent at the
top of the cone, the same size as the tube.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.810
So if you flatten the cone and cut along the
inside markings at the tip, you’ll end up

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.259
with a little stabilizer cone the perfect
size for your darts.

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.960
While we’re here, let’s cut a small piece
off the very tip as well, because we’ll

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.789
need this small hole for the screw to fit
through in just a second.

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:24.130
I made 4 more stabilizer cones in just a couple
of minutes, and now that we have improvised

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.149
fletchings for each of the 5 screws, let’s
get busy putting these cap darts together.

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:31.770
To set the dart cones in place, simply pull
a screw through the hole at the tip, until

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.819
the head catches on the inside of the cone.

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:37.679
And to prep it for gluing, try threading a
nut onto the very tip of the screw. You’ll

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:41.219
see this way, the darts stand upright with
the open end facing upward. Which is really

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:45.389
cool, because now we can easily squirt a dab
of hot glue in the top, and seal the two together.

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:49.209
You’ll only need to fill the cones about
halfway with hot glue, then give them a couple

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:51.429
of minutes, to cool and set.

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:54.639
Now to finish the darts off, we need to add
a little weight to the tip so they’ll fly

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:58.389
straight. And you can see that shifting the
center of gravity as easy as threading a second

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:02.340
nut into position at the top. The nuts should
sit about 1/4” back from the tip, and if

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.490
you want to make sure they don’t move out
of place, try dripping a little thread lock,

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.869
or super glue in-between the threads.

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.370
If you’re in the mood to add a little style
to your darts, try picking up a pack of brass

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.569
#6 screw-nuts like these. By changing the
colors of your hex nuts, you can give your

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:16.870
darts a bit of class.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.700
Alright, our cap dart is finished and ready
for action. We just need to charge the

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.530
tip so it’ll explode on impact. And that’s
only as difficult as reaching for a pack of

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.730
ring caps. I found mine at a local super center,
and sometimes you can find them at the dollar store as well.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.590
Use a pair of scissors to slowly and carefully
cut the individual caps off the rings, making

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.970
sure you don’t accidentally cut through
them. And within seconds, you’ll have yourself

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.400
8 impact sensitive blast caps, ready to go.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.560
Just for fun, I went ahead and cut the caps
off every ring in the package and ended up

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.579
with 216 explosive charges, at an average
cost of a penny each. That works out to about

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:52.629
a hundred bangs for your buck, not bad.

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:55.890
Now looking around for a convenient place
to store these blast caps, I realized the

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.799
container for the Krazy Glue could be a really
great option. It’s pretty much garbage anyway,

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.650
but rather than throwing it away, let’s
put it to good use. Just like that, we’ve

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.909
got a pocket-sized storage container, filled
to the brim with extra ammo.

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:11.569
Now the reason I chose #6 machine screws for
these darts was because they’re the perfect

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.349
size for these particular ring caps. And to
load the detonator cap, all you need to do

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:20.909
is slowly and carefully, push the bolt straight
down inside the cup. That’s how easy it is to lock and load.

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:25.019
It’s impact sensitive, so to crack the caps,
try dangling the dart high above the sidewalk,

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.640
then simply let it go. You’ll see the darts
pop as soon as they make contact with a hard

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.659
surface, and they make a satisfying bang every
time they do. Which should be just loud enough

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:36.540
to startle anyone not paying close attention.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.090
Now I designed these darts to be used with
the laser blowgun we made in a previous project.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.719
And even though they’re a heavier kind of
ammunition, they’re still impressively accurate

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:48.030
at close range. When the darts hit a wooden
target, the force of the explosion actually

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.780
blasts little chunks of wood out of the center.
So even though ring caps are relatively safe

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.540
for the most part, it is important to use
caution, and be extra careful where you aim them.

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.620
If you don’t have a blowgun, just try throwing
them by hand. They throw the same way you’d

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.799
launch a dart, and if you lob one high into
the sky, it’ll plummet to the ground

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:04.590
and impact with a crack.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.760
By the way, you can pack more power into your
explosions by layering up the blast pads.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.650
I tried using a small precision screwdriver
to carefully pry the pads out of the cups

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.329
one at a time, then pack 4 of them into one
single cup. The modified caps get loaded the

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:23.089
exact same way, the only difference is that
this time, the explosion makes your ears ring a little bit longer.

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.889
Well now you know how to convert machine screws
and ring caps, into a handful of impact sensitive

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.949
cap darts. So whether you intend on making
a handful of exploding stun darts for your

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:35.199
blowgun quiver, or just making a simple toy
for your kids to explore science, a homemade

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:37.539
cap dart is sure to be a blast.

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:41.460
By the way, if you want an even cheaper option,
try using 2” finishing nails like these.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.940
They work perfectly well for blow darts, and
you can make 40 of them for around $2.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.640
Well that’s it for now. If you like this
project perhaps you’ll like some of my others.
