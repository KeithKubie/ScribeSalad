00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.339
would have gotten the point across so
much more if they actually showed a

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:10.349
much more if they actually showed a
 

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:12.199
much more if they actually showed a
little bit maybe you could open with

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:12.209
little bit maybe you could open with
 

00:06:12.209 --> 00:06:13.939
little bit maybe you could open with
that like the kid in the hospital and

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:13.949
that like the kid in the hospital and
 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:16.339
that like the kid in the hospital and
the sister feeling bad and then like you

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:16.349
the sister feeling bad and then like you
 

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:18.019
the sister feeling bad and then like you
see in that moment she had to grow up

00:06:18.019 --> 00:06:18.029
see in that moment she had to grow up
 

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:19.909
see in that moment she had to grow up
and he had to grow up just a little

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919
and he had to grow up just a little
 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:22.339

something but we get none of that here

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:22.349
something but we get none of that here
 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:23.899
something but we get none of that here
the only bits we do get it's an

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:23.909
the only bits we do get it's an
 

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:26.389
the only bits we do get it's an
occasional smart line for example I like

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:26.399
occasional smart line for example I like
 

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:27.829
occasional smart line for example I like
when they're in the garage and Francis

00:06:27.829 --> 00:06:27.839
when they're in the garage and Francis
 

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:29.149
when they're in the garage and Francis
said if the brother didn't believe in

00:06:29.149 --> 00:06:29.159
said if the brother didn't believe in
 

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:30.829
said if the brother didn't believe in
the imaginary friend anymore why did he

00:06:30.829 --> 00:06:30.839
the imaginary friend anymore why did he
 

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:33.109
the imaginary friend anymore why did he
stay - which Larry said he still needed

00:06:33.109 --> 00:06:33.119
stay - which Larry said he still needed
 

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:35.509
stay - which Larry said he still needed
me it's actually kind of interesting and

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:35.519
me it's actually kind of interesting and
 

00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:37.459
me it's actually kind of interesting and
can be taken a lot of ways one of the

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:37.469
can be taken a lot of ways one of the
 

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:39.409
can be taken a lot of ways one of the
final lines is also kind of brilliant I

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:39.419
final lines is also kind of brilliant I
 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:41.480
final lines is also kind of brilliant I
guess it takes a lot of

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:41.490
guess it takes a lot of
 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:45.510
guess it takes a lot of
becoming food again in a story like this

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:45.520
becoming food again in a story like this
 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.459
becoming food again in a story like this
that's surprisingly profound and it

00:06:47.459 --> 00:06:47.469
that's surprisingly profound and it
 

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:50.129
that's surprisingly profound and it
didn't mean much just a line or two but

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:50.139
didn't mean much just a line or two but
 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:51.869
didn't mean much just a line or two but
like I said everything is either over

00:06:51.869 --> 00:06:51.879
like I said everything is either over
 

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:53.820

talked or not talked about enough it's

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:53.830
talked or not talked about enough it's
 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.679
talked or not talked about enough it's
like the focus is always in the wrong

00:06:55.679 --> 00:06:55.689
like the focus is always in the wrong
 

00:06:55.689 --> 00:06:58.109
like the focus is always in the wrong
place if I was a kid I would probably

00:06:58.109 --> 00:06:58.119
place if I was a kid I would probably
 

00:06:58.119 --> 00:07:00.600
place if I was a kid I would probably
like chunks of it the darker stuff I'm

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:00.610
like chunks of it the darker stuff I'm
 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:01.980
like chunks of it the darker stuff I'm
sure Larry would probably get a laugh

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:01.990
sure Larry would probably get a laugh
 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:03.779
sure Larry would probably get a laugh
out of me too but I don't know if I

00:07:03.779 --> 00:07:03.789
out of me too but I don't know if I
 

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:05.609
out of me too but I don't know if I
would have watch it a lot as again I'd

00:07:05.609 --> 00:07:05.619
would have watch it a lot as again I'd
 

00:07:05.619 --> 00:07:07.469
would have watch it a lot as again I'd
had to wait for quite a bit to get to

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:07.479
had to wait for quite a bit to get to
 

00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:09.570
had to wait for quite a bit to get to
those moments if you grew up loving it

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:09.580
those moments if you grew up loving it
 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.999
those moments if you grew up loving it
fair enough I can see why I guess but

00:07:11.999 --> 00:07:12.009
fair enough I can see why I guess but
 

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:13.679
fair enough I can see why I guess but
for me this clutter under the bed is

00:07:13.679 --> 00:07:13.689
for me this clutter under the bed is
 

00:07:13.689 --> 00:07:20.870
for me this clutter under the bed is
just a little too messy
