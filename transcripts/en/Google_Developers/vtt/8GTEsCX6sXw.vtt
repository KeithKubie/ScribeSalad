00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:08.970
GUS CLASS: Hello world.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.160
And welcome to this week's
episode of "Google+ Developers

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.520
Live." I'm Gus Class,
a developer

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.350
programs engineer on Google+.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.210
And today joining me is a
special guest, Louis Gray.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.275
LOUIS GRAY: I don't know if
special's the right word.

00:00:22.275 --> 00:00:24.820
I'm here for "Google Developers
Live" all the time.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.230
It is always my pleasure
to join you.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.870
Especially about one of my
favorite products here at

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.910
Google, Google+.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:30.980
GUS CLASS: Well it's
great to have you.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.470
And you're always welcome
on a show.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.710
LOUIS GRAY: Thank you, sir.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:36.060
GUS CLASS: Yes.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.040
So this is going to be an
episode covering best

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.762
practices for Google+.

00:00:39.762 --> 00:00:41.970
And this is sort of
the third in a

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.690
series that we've started.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.530
And if you want to have a little
preview of what we're

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.170
going to be showing today,
we'll be talking about

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.125
interactive posts and targeting
them in unique ways.

00:00:55.125 --> 00:00:56.320
LOUIS GRAY: So interactive
posts.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.750
Now you mentioned a second ago,
you said "best practices

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.830
for Google+." But we're not
talking about best practices

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.490
on how to use Google+, or when
the post, or when to look at

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.260
your stream, or any of those
things from the consumer side.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.940
We're talking more on
the developer angle.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:09.920
Because we are a
developer show.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:10.960
That's what we do here.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.360
So you want to talk about
interactive posts.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.400
What are the things anyway?

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.990
They're kind of new.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.520
Tell me more.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.250
GUS CLASS: Yes they are.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.420
So interactive posts-- we like
to think of them as a new way

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.140
of sharing.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.280
So as opposed to the traditional
shares that we've

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.650
done on Google+, interactive
posts now have a call to

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.760
action, such as download,
or attack, or view

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.850
that allows you to--

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:31.290
LOUIS GRAY: Attack?

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.220
GUS CLASS: Attack is--
yes one of those.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.330
LOUIS GRAY: Not attach?

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.880
GUS CLASS: Attack.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.000
LOUIS GRAY: Attack
[INAUDIBLE].

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.390
GUS CLASS: So if you wanted to
have a call to action that

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.850
would cause users in each other
streams to attack each

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.850
other inside of your
application, this new way of

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.930
sharing allows you to directly
bring users in, and then

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.140
perform actions within
your applications.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.780
So this is kind of new.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.480
And we're very excited
about it.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.800
And it's been one of the key
launch features that we had.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.400
And it added a lot of stuff that
people were looking for.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.970
Like being able to pre-fill
text inside of

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.150
the interactive posts.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.550
So we're all really
excited about it.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.880
LOUIS GRAY: I just want to
hear more about attack.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.389
GUS CLASS: Attack, yes.

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:10.520
LOUIS GRAY: Hopefully
we'll get into that.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.670
GUS CLASS: Yes this was one of
our demos that we are going to

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.380
show for I/O. Anyways, if you
remember last week, we were

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:23.160
talking about ways to improve
the sign in experience by

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.940
dynamically rendering scopes.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.490
And if you take a look at the
site from last week, we can

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.030
show you that one more time.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.960
And so what we'd started with
was kind of like a real,

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.510
conventional Sign-In button.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.720
And we replaced it
instead with this

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.270
custom Sign-In button.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.360
And when that renders, you get
this pop-up that allows you to

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.790
choose the scopes that you're
going to be using for the app.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.800
So I'll turn on Google
Drive and Google+.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.580
And then here's a consent
dialogue that's real common,

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.900
if you've ever seen
an application

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.326
that's using Google+.

00:02:58.326 --> 00:03:00.910
And then the thing that
we'd done on the first

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.990
show happens now.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.890
And the user's profile
information is animated, and

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.520
they're drawn into the app to
kind of have that emotional

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.980
connection.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.200
So by rendering the scopes
dynamically inside of the

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.690
Sign-In button, you're able to
draw more users to sign in for

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.760
your app, because they're able
to trust this application, and

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.370
the things that they're
sharing with you.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.740
And then, by rendering that
profile in a unique way, and

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.050
drawing the user's eye to it,
and welcoming them once they

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.840
come back into your
applications, you're able to

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.390
build that emotional
connection.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.670
Which is something that
social is all about.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.500
LOUIS GRAY: Now you talked
pretty quick through that

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.430
concern dialogue.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.030
As fast as I've seen it
in here in a while.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.810
So what is it exactly that
Google+ is asking

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.020
for in terms of access?

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.780
And how does the user
determine what

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.700
they're willing to share?

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.360
Because in my mind, not every
application should have access

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.630
to everything that
I do on Google+.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:56.280
So how--

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.650
I know we've talked
about it before--

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.430
what is something that either
the developer has to look for,

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.010
or the user has to look for
when granting access

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.480
to an app like this?

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.350
GUS CLASS: Sure, so I'll bring
up the dialog again.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.320
And we'll look at two
different ones.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.930
So here is just the Google+
sign in dialogue.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.579
And if you look on here,
there's two fields.

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.060
There's the one on the top,
underneath of the "this app

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.130
would like to." The first bar is
the information that you're

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.970
sharing with Google+.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.620
And the information that the
application has access to, and

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.380
who has access to that
information.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:40.260
So then, the second set allows
you to control who can see the

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.210
information that this
app is creating.

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.960
So if we render it again, we're
going to show it with an

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.030
additional scope now.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.730
So here's Google Drive
and Google+.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.780
When I click the Sign-In button,
we'll get a different

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:54.640
consent dialogue.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.930
LOUIS GRAY: So now there's
three bars there.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:56.770
GUS CLASS: Now there's
three bars.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.090
So this additional bar is
requesting information to be

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.080
able to view files
and documents

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.440
in your Google Drive.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.500
So some people get scared
when they see this.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:13.630
And just by controlling how that
appears, you can allow

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.140
people to be comfortable
with sharing what

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.480
they like to share.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.950
LOUIS GRAY: Now I think what's
critical for the user in this

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.470
case is, because you're giving
it access to Google Drive, it

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:22.910
explicitly calls it out.

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.490
It's not obfuscated,
it's not vague.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.765
It says look, if you're going
to need access to Google

00:05:27.765 --> 00:05:30.340
Drive, well by gum, here's
access to Google Drive.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.640
And if you need access
to Google+,

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.010
here's access to Google+.

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.720
And because Google has this
shared backend of the two

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.540
systems working together,
we should

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:39.700
explicitly call that out.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.570
And not just vaguely
say, Google.

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.720
And then we should let the users
know always exactly what

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.680
the applications can do.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.610
And so while, as you mentioned,
it is more

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.270
messaging to read through, at
least the user knows exactly

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.530
what they're getting into when
they're giving an application

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.480
more accessibility.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.190
GUS CLASS: Exactly.

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.980
So you never want to surprise
someone with information that

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.560
they haven't seen, or that they
didn't know they were

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.880
sharing with you.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.770
Because yeah, if someone's
private information starts

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.100
getting surfaced inside of your
app, then that's going to

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.530
create all sorts of problems.

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.050
OK, so here's a consent
dialogue.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.220
And this time I'm showing it to
enable access to my Google

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.410
Drive files.

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.710
And then, the other thing that
we'd done before was we'd

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.360
brought in the user's photos.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.390
And now we have the photos, we
should allow them to share

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.050
those photos with people.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.750
So what we're going to do is
we're going to render an

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:37.090
interactive post when a user
clicks on a particular photo.

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.400
I don't know what's going on
with my resolution, but here's

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:40.970
the dialogue.

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.160
And here's the share dialogue
that I've created.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.440
So inside of here is just
this Share button.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.880
And that is just
an HTML button.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.950
You can take pretty much any
HTML container, and then can

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:56.860
render an interactive
post into that.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.420
And I'll show you the code
in just a second.

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.450
But yeah, so this is it.

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:06.930
And now when I click Share, the
last set of people that I

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.470
was sharing with will appear
inside of the To field.

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.300
So this is a really
good default.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.010
And a lot of people
start with it.

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.760
So this is a great starting
point for sharing.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:23.820
And this is a great way to allow
users to have more--

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:27.430
whatever their last default
settings were, they just get

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:28.610
brought in.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:29.000
LOUIS GRAY: Now, I noticed--

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.280
I'm taking a look
at this snippet.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.770
Now, you have "this is so cute,"
which is a pre-filled

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:33.960
text that's on there.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.400
And then you have a photo.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.900
And then it says doc slash
number, number et cetera.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.530
Now, maybe it makes sense
to a machine.

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:43.750
But since we're working with
social, working with humans,

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.440
how could a developer clean it
up so that that snippet is a

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.720
little bit better?

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.300
GUS CLASS: So what a developer
could do is, they can control

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.250
the way that content appears
within the stream.

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:56.390
And they can control the way
that app activities appear

00:07:56.390 --> 00:08:00.820
inside of their app activities
in their application settings

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:02.570
by writing a snippet.

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:06.460
So the snippet is just
microdata, which is kind of an

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:10.710
annotation that is added
to markup on your page.

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:13.790
And those annotations can then
be tied to elements.

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:18.320
And then what Google does is
they calculate the way that

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.640
this will render, the way that
this will appear, based on

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.730
that microdata that's
on your page.

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:26.840
So for example, the
microdata on this

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.330
page is just not there.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.930
So Google tries to do the
best that they can.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:32.929
And so they may be pulling
this in from the title.

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:35.159
They may be pulling this
in from metadata

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:37.480
on the content target.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.559
I'm not sure, specifically,
where this is coming from.

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:43.520
But this is a great topic,
perhaps, for a future best

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.350
practices episode.

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:47.080
Where we can look into improving
this experience even

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.490
more by using a snippet
and microdata.

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:51.490
LOUIS GRAY: Excellent, cool.

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:52.060
I'll let you continue.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:52.960
I don't want to get
in your way.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:53.080
GUS CLASS: Awesome.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.680
Yeah, no problem.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.990
So now the user can share.

00:08:56.990 --> 00:09:00.030
And let's see how that's done.

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:03.250
Here's a code that's rendering
the interactive post as I'm

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:04.550
doing it there.

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:07.660
And what you need for an
interactive post is a constant

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:13.040
URL, which contains the
content target.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:17.460
So this is what populates
the image, and so on.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.330
And then you have a call to
action URL, which is what

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:24.530
happens when the user clicks the
interactive share button.

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:28.630
So for example, this one says
"download." And this is the

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:31.930
content target that will be used
when the user clicks that

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:33.430
Download button.

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:35.380
And then the last thing
that we're passing

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:36.360
here is people IDs.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.900
And we'll get to that in
a second, because I'm

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.170
not using it yet.

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:43.240
But you can see that all of
these options are set inside

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.990
of a JSON structure.

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:49.060
And then they're passed to the
gapi.interactivepost.render

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:53.880
with the container that will
be used to contain that

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.510
interactive post.

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:59.050
Going back to our site, we
have this experience.

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:00.250
Let's make it better.

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:04.580
So now what I'm going to do,
is I'm going to change the

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:05.820
mode of the site.

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:07.480
And this is a live site.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:11.360
So if you want to check it
out, you're welcome to.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.060
LOUIS GRAY: And what's
the URL for this guy?

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:16.710
istoocute.com/#better.

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:18.390
That seems a little simple.

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:20.640
I could just do #better, and
your telling me my site

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:21.630
automatically gets better?

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:23.050
Is that what happens?

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:23.970
GUS CLASS: I think that
that would be a

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:25.800
pretty awesome feature.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.510
And I'm pretty sure someone's
requested it already.

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:28.930
LOUIS GRAY: We should talk to
the Chrome team about that.

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:31.130
GUS CLASS: Chrome team, yes.

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:33.610
All right, so now we have the
same site with an experience

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:34.770
that's slightly different.

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:38.480
Now let's say that what I want
to happen, when that user

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.435
performs an interactive share,
is that it lets me know.

00:10:42.435 --> 00:10:43.940
And it let's Louis know.

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:47.960
So that as curators of the site,
we can find this cute

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.540
thing, download it, and
add it to the site.

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:54.700
So in doing this, I think that
sharing publicly is not going

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:56.120
to be the right way to do it.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:00.390
And also, mandating that the
user find us on Google+, or

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:04.440
that they have to be in circles
in order to appear

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.150
immediately within that share
dialogue, it's not as good of

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:07.730
an experience for the user.

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:14.430
So instead, now when we share,
something magical happens.

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:16.410
The Share button gets
rendered again.

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:19.910
And now Louis and I are
pre-populated inside

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:20.620
of the Share box.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.910
So I'll show you how to
do this in a minute.

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:24.710
But let's see something
else that happens

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:26.900
when I click Share.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:30.200
Because the interactive post
was targeted to specific

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:34.110
people, those specific people
will receive notifications

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:38.700
across Google that somebody has
shared something with them

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.490
of great relevance.

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:43.910
When you share something
directly with someone, you get

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:47.170
higher engagement because each
of those individuals will

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:49.050
receive notifications.

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:50.630
So let's see what that
notification

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:53.050
looks like on my machine.

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:55.510
If everything went
as expected.

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:59.290
So now this interactive post
is shared with me.

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:03.530
And by clicking it, I get
this experience for that

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:07.200
interactive post directly from
within my Google Calendar.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:11.390
So this is a really powerful way
to bring users into your

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:14.150
app through organic
or viral growth.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.730
LOUIS GRAY: And that's
pretty cool.

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:16.460
I actually got the same
notification.

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:18.470
I mean you sent it to yourself,
you sent it to me.

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:20.810
And so I have the same
capability with the same

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:22.880
download feature over
on my computer.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.720
Now we're not sharing two
computers at once, just

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.440
believe it's there.

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.290
So that is pretty cool.

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:29.670
I mean, you basically know who
it's going to get targeted to.

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:32.550
You're getting a direct message,
essentially, saying

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:34.160
that they're getting a
notification on this post.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.250
And I can take an action.

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:37.530
In this case, it was to
download that image.

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:41.250
And so the cute puppy or the
gopher that you were showing

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:42.890
goes directly to me.

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:44.790
GUS CLASS: Awesome.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:47.610
So in doing that, we're able
to draw in more users.

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:50.970
And let's just take a look
and see how it's done.

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:54.620
So here is almost the
exact same code that

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:57.070
I showed you before.

00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:01.030
And you'll notice, if I just
flip between the two, that

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:05.310
this extra line, "recipients,"
is added to the JSON that is

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:09.370
passed to the
gapi.interactivepost.render.

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:13.690
And so what you need to put into
this field of people IDs

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:16.680
is going to be Google
user IDs.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:20.520
And these can be retrieved from
People.List, or you could

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.600
put in email addresses
directly.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:26.355
And so when you do this, you're
able to either draw in

00:13:26.355 --> 00:13:29.370
more users by email address, or
by the connections that a

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:32.660
user has on Google+, or directly
to an individual,

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:35.520
which is sort of the
non-conventional way that I've

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.840
shown it today.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.350
So this is good.

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:40.480
We're targeting interactive
posts now.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.790
And users are receiving
notifications, which is

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:47.690
drawing in higher engagement and
more users who are using

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:49.640
your app and being brought
into your app

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.200
from the Google+ stream.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.890
Now let's see, one more way
that we can get creative.

00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:58.500
LOUIS GRAY: How about
more awesome?

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.090
GUS CLASS: Or more awesomer.

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:03.160
OK, more awesome, sorry.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.600
So let's look at one more
thing that we can do.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:11.600
So again, the best practices
here are just really think

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.890
about creative ways that you
can create an experience

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:15.700
that's right for your site.

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.880
And for my site, let's say that
I want to have a feature

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.910
where someone can share things
that are cute with the people

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:25.130
who they are the most relevant
to share with.

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:27.820
The people that they care the
most about, or that they're

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:30.460
engaging with the most, or
that they're emailing the

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.510
most, and so on.

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:34.330
With Google+, you're
able to do this.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.770
So let's do this share
one more time.

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:41.330
And now I said "share." And now
what I can do is, I can

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:43.120
select some people,
some specific

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:43.990
people, to share with.

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:48.560
So now what I can do is, if I
select these 10 people, or

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:52.810
these 5 people, or these 10
people, and click Share,

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:55.020
instead of that share dialogue,
those people have

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:58.126
been dynamically added
to the share.

00:14:58.126 --> 00:14:59.550
LOUIS GRAY: Now That was
a pretty cool demo.

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:02.055
I mean, you've got avatars
of the people down below.

00:15:02.055 --> 00:15:03.270
It automatically
fills them in.

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:05.710
It's not just a list of
names by text, right?

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:06.300
GUS CLASS: Yup.

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:07.690
LOUIS GRAY: And I'm kind of used
to that scenario where

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:10.370
you have to know the user's
explicit username.

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:12.260
Or you have to know their
name and you pull it

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:13.500
from a bit of text.

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:14.510
This is much more personal.

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:16.970
I'm going to recognize your
avatar, maybe even more than I

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:18.010
recognize you in real life.

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:19.860
Because I see you online
all the time.

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:22.320
And this seems like a quick way
for the user to find their

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.470
friends rapidly and
hit the buttons.

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:25.280
Pretty cool.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:25.780
GUS CLASS: So yeah.

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:27.010
So you can pre-populate that.

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:31.270
And then up to 10 people will
receive notifications across

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:36.180
Google, telling them whatever
your call to action is, and

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:38.980
then rendering this within
their stream, and across

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:41.400
Google instead of that
notifications area.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.860
So we'll look at the
code one more time.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:48.120
And just to sort of see how much
I'm doing in addition to

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:51.240
what just the minimum is for
sharing in order to do this.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:54.410
So the first thing that we
need to do is, we need to

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:58.600
render a picker for the best
people to share it with.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.350
And so this is a special
feature of Google+.

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:05.380
And what it does is it
calculates who the best people

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:09.600
are across all of your friends,
and people who you've

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.410
circled and shared
with this app.

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:14.210
Or people who you've made
visible to this app.

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:17.790
And then it calculates just
who are the most relevant

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:20.840
people for this particular
user?

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:25.500
So I'm doing this API call
for Plus.People.List.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:29.820
And that magic field that I'm
adding is order by best.

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:32.780
And I'm doing something
else here that is a

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:33.580
good thing to do.

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:36.790
And I'm filtering the content
that comes back to just

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:42.010
contain a URL and the user's ID,
and then their image URL.

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:46.680
But that's probably a topic best
saved for another best

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.890
practices session, again.

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:51.840
And then what I'm doing is I'm
just rendering that HTML

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.310
inside of the picker.

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:57.690
Now, the next thing that happens
is the last piece,

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:02.770
where you need to do something
extra because of this

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:04.190
interaction that you're
building.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:11.089
And that is, you need to
re-render the Share button

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:12.300
inside of your page.

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:18.020
And so when you render that
Share button, Google will

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:21.400
change all the content within
there so that it's hooked up

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:22.359
to Google services.

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:28.600
So when you do that, it's
difficult to retrieve that

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:29.810
area again.

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:34.440
So what I do is, I have a
container outside of the

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:38.160
target container that
I then use to empty

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.870
that surrounding container.

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:46.470
And then I can use the same
target for that container that

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:48.200
I was using before.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:52.450
So that pretty much
sums it up.

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:57.170
To sort of recap real quickly,
by targeting interactive posts

00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:00.810
what you can do is you can
trigger those notifications

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:02.030
across Google.

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:05.790
And you can draw more users into
your apps, directly from

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:09.640
the Google+ stream, and directly
from the Google

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.270
notifications area.

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:12.340
LOUIS GRAY: Right
within your app.

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:13.650
And from your site.

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:14.230
GUS CLASS: Yes.

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.900
LOUIS GRAY: And so, one of the
questions I have as a user who

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.570
might be targeted by one of your
notifications, since I

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:22.440
expect I'm automatically in
your best, and we'll talk

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:23.690
about that soon.

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:25.810
But if I'm automatically
notified, do I get a

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:27.540
notification of which
app it was from?

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:31.080
Like, is this some sort of
enhanced visibility for the

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.970
developer who's application
uses this content?

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:38.200
Do I get to know if it came
from itstoocute.com or

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.610
whatever this project is?

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:42.640
GUS CLASS: Yes.

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.920
This is a great branding
opportunity when you're

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.290
rendering the interactive
post.

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:49.410
And you can control it through
pre-filled text.

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:56.630
And it'll also resurface within
other places inside of

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:58.480
that interactive post.

00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:59.040
So yes.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.900
LOUIS GRAY: So it's another way
to drive more installs,

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:03.970
more visibility, more access
to more people.

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:07.260
So it's not only better for
the application user, it's

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.570
better for the recipients of
content, and it's better for

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:11.240
the developers themselves.

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.030
So that's why this
is critical.

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:15.020
It's not just a new feature
because we could do it.

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:17.290
I think it's because it's
the right thing to do.

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:18.980
GUS CLASS: Yeah, it's the right
thing to do for users.

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:22.220
It's the right thing to
do for developers.

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:25.000
And so it's kind of a win-win
when we launched it.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.310
We were real excited about how
this is going to improve the

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:31.140
experience for all the people
who are developing and

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:34.180
consuming products that

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:36.130
incorporate the Google+ platform.

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:39.100
So yes, very exciting.

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:42.000
And do you have any other
questions, Louis?

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.080
LOUIS GRAY: No I think
we answered them

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:43.980
right the way through.

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.130
I've seen a number of
interactive posts as this has

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:47.470
just rolled out.

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:48.890
A few applications getting
that started.

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:50.860
And I think every single week
when we hear from the Google+

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:54.130
team here on Google+ Developers
Live, we get to

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:56.622
understand more of the assets
that are being used, more of

00:19:56.622 --> 00:19:58.360
the applications that are
getting into this.

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.170
And I think we're going to learn
more every single week.

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:00.640
GUS CLASS: Yes.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.390
Actually, that reminds me.

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:06.350
We're always keeping our eyes
open for sites in the wild

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:10.010
that are doing these kinds of
creative things with the

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:12.490
Google+ platform.

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:18.040
Please feel free to mention me
or to mention the Google

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:21.120
Developers page if you're doing
something that you think

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.400
stands out and is unique.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:28.200
Because I'm always delighted
when I visit a website, and

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:32.410
then I see them doing something
creative that really

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:36.285
will improve the experience for
users, and probably draw

00:20:36.285 --> 00:20:38.400
up engagement for that
particular website.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:38.530
LOUIS GRAY: Absolutely.

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:40.360
And I think just to piggyback
on that, I mean,

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:41.420
this is your show.

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:44.030
This is "Google+ Developers
Live." It's about you guys.

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:46.120
It's about making your
applications better and making

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:48.180
the experience better
for our users.

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:50.450
And so, as you find new
applications that take

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:53.000
advantage of Google+ Sign-In,
that take advantage of Google+

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.570
Interactive Posts, or any of the
features that are rolling

00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:58.250
out on Google+ platform, we
want to hear about it.

00:20:58.250 --> 00:20:59.790
And you'll probably be showcased
here on "Google+

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:01.070
Developers Live."

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:01.690
GUS CLASS: Yes.

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:03.720
All right well thanks
for coming in today.

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:06.060
And we'll be back in--

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:08.330
so next week we probably will
not have another "Best

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:09.360
Practices" episode.

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.150
I will be taking
a short break.

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:13.800
But the week after, or sometime
after that, I'll

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.350
probably be back with additional
best practices to

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:17.580
share with you guys.

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:21.420
So please feel free to ask
any questions in the

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:22.230
event and so on.

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:23.730
We'll try to follow
up afterwards.

00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:28.220
And enjoy developing with
Google+ platform, and using

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:29.860
products that incorporate us.

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:31.110
LOUIS GRAY: Thanks, Gus.
