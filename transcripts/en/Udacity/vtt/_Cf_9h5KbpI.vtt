00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In the last problem, we broke down Robin's pushing force.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We broke it into an x and y component, we had to do some trig but that was okay.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Speaking of breaking things down, what if Robin succeeds? What if she breaks this wall apart?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The force provided by the wall, well, of course, it has to go away.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And what do we have now? Now, we have unbalanced forces.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And when I say unbalance, what I mean is that this force doesn't have a companion force to the left.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We are now entering the world of acceleration.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Now, how do we solve the problem of what is this cart's acceleration going to be?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Well, we already know that these forces balance this force.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
There's not going to be any vertical acceleration, ay = 0,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
ax on the other hand will not equal zero.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It will equal something much more interesting and let's calculate.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Well, the simplest thing, F = ma, but now, the only force we're using

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
is the unbalanced force and that's equal to 86.6 N.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I know the mass is 10, and when I solve, I get a = 8.66 m/sÂ².

00:00:57.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Sorry, I did that one on my own. You have a chance to this next one.
