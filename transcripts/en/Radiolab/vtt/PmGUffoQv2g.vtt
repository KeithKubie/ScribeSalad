WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.770
Who, I mean I don't have a real good game plan for how we start to show.

2
00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:06.690
But in the, in the, in the spirit of the show,

3
00:00:06.691 --> 00:00:09.870
maybe we should just drop into the that Radiolab staff meeting that we had.

4
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.580
Yeah, I remember it. It was a very a, it was the people that are like, um, what

5
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.770
can you put this next to us? Okay. So set it up.

6
00:00:19.771 --> 00:00:23.880
Recently we came up with this challenge. Challenge. Yeah.

7
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.250
Two for the radio lab staff. We get everyone together

8
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.380
and an inappropriately stodgy conference room area.

9
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.630
Sort of dialing in from Wisconsin.

10
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.170
Alright, we're going to go the big reveal.

11
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.110
Everybody take a deep breath.

12
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.360
I had warned them ahead of time that something big was coming.

13
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.850
It's nothing obviously.

14
00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.920
[inaudible]. Anyway, after we got over that little bump in the road, I just,

15
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.150
I basically outlined this, this challenge.

16
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.670
<v 1>We came up with a little, a little plan to, which basically boils down to this.</v>

17
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.120
On September 27th,

18
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.550
we're gonna release a story or a set of stories. Really, um,

19
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.930
I'm depleted today and that date you will have to pitch, report,

20
00:01:21.931 --> 00:01:24.120
record produced said story,

21
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.450
you will have that much time to do it and we will be putting it up no matter

22
00:01:27.451 --> 00:01:28.284
what.

23
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.110
<v 0>We were giving them like a week to pitch this story and then a week to make it</v>

24
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.290
right.

25
00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.230
<v 1>And you will have to do a story either about breaking news,</v>

26
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.330
so something that just happened or you can do a story about pairs.

27
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.320
So I'm calling the whole thing, uh, bad news bears.

28
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.840
<v 0>Yeah, I remember we've had bears sort of in the,</v>

29
00:01:51.841 --> 00:01:54.640
in the room so long and you know, I remember the,

30
00:01:54.641 --> 00:01:57.820
I remember the tech in my memory store and tell me if I'm right,

31
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.780
it just happened over text was a text. Yeah. This is, this is one of those like,

32
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.550
uh, you know what you talking about princess and the Pea,

33
00:02:03.551 --> 00:02:06.910
like there's a p to 14 mattresses down that just bothers you.

34
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.320
Like one of the ps that's been bothering me is, um,

35
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.710
the length of time it takes us to make these stories.

36
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.800
Sometimes I can feel too burdensome and we want it to just, uh,

37
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.500
like do an experiment where we shortcut the hell out of that. Just try to put,

38
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.460
it was just the strange juxtaposition scene. All right.

39
00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.050
I want you guys to go out now and find something that is hot new and sudden and

40
00:02:29.051 --> 00:02:33.040
just breaking like a real reporter or bears.

41
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.650
Right. That's such a weird, that's exactly,

42
00:02:38.651 --> 00:02:40.420
it's like how are you going to cook that dish?

43
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.050
<v 1>Here's a here, let me explain how it's gonna go then.</v>

44
00:02:43.051 --> 00:02:45.720
So you're going to get carried up. I'll give you those pairings in a second.

45
00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.480
The story has to be under 10 minutes.

46
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.430
The story must at some point in it include audio from the movie, Bad news bears,

47
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.550
the original, the stories.

48
00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.460
We might lose some point for recording from outside the office. Uh,

49
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.410
any aeration has to be done in conversation and have to be staring at somebody

50
00:03:05.411 --> 00:03:10.210
across the glass and not going and tracks a little line. Uh,

51
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.280
before I do your teams, your parents, are there any questions?

52
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.510
How are we, how are we defining freaking news had a reasonable question.

53
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.260
I would give you a little bit like I would maybe be willing to accept something

54
00:03:23.261 --> 00:03:26.290
from last week. Otherwise today forward.

55
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.893
<v 2>Wow.</v>

56
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.360
<v 1>Yeah. Uh, why are we doing this?</v>

57
00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.990
<v 2>[inaudible] guilty can be fun.</v>

58
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.600
[inaudible] alright. Alright.

59
00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.230
I'm Jen. I am Robert. Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. Okay.

60
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:02.363
This is Radiolab

61
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.270
<v 0>today. Uh, we are breaking bad news bears.</v>

62
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.120
Okay. So everybody went out from that meeting and again, the task was a,

63
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.290
to reiterate the breaking news story,

64
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:19.990
break news story or bears or bears week when week to do everything. Yeah.

65
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.200
You got to go out, you've got to get the tape, you've got to come back,

66
00:04:22.201 --> 00:04:25.090
put it in the computer, cut it up at the music. Right. The thing,

67
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.870
we have eight producers for that Crepe, that check, check, check,

68
00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.080
check and fact sheet producers means four teams.

69
00:04:30.081 --> 00:04:34.680
So that means we end up in the grand total of four stories. Yes.

70
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.280
Starting who we started with. Yeah. How about Molly Webster and Simon out? Yeah.

71
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.373
<v 1>Okay.</v>

72
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.660
<v 3>Well I will say that we have checked both boxes here.</v>

73
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.880
We have a story that is both about bears and breaking news.

74
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.893
You're kidding.

75
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.190
<v 0>Extra. You do get extra points,</v>

76
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.090
<v 3>so, all right, you there Matt? I am great. Last week we gave this guy a call.</v>

77
00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.800
<v 4>Uh,</v>

78
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.180
my name is Matt [inaudible] and I am the director of public works for the city

79
00:05:04.181 --> 00:05:04.970
of Newburgh.

80
00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.010
<v 3>And you've got quite the task ahead of you, Huh?</v>

81
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:08.453
<v 4>Uh, yeah.</v>

82
00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.430
<v 5>[inaudible] I can do some destruction.</v>

83
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.370
<v 6>Hurricane Florence is making landfall the devastating flooding and damaging</v>

84
00:05:17.371 --> 00:05:21.120
winds. We've had hurricane, hurricane Florence come through last week.

85
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.830
One of the hardest hit areas is Newburn in new Bern, new Bern, North Carolina.

86
00:05:25.831 --> 00:05:29.880
This is a live look in Newburn as the water has really overtaken this.

87
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.510
There's relentless rain and wind. It's brought down trees.

88
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.960
If you've been watching the news at all over the past couple of weeks,

89
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.450
[inaudible]

90
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.430
<v 3>probably seen Newburn on TV.</v>

91
00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:40.910
<v 0>As you just heard,</v>

92
00:05:40.911 --> 00:05:45.230
it was one of the towns that was hardest hit by Hurricane Florence.

93
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.770
Homes were destroyed. Tens of millions of dollars of destruction.

94
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.030
Trees were knocked down

95
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.960
<v 6>and with those trees have come power lines with the power lines down.</v>

96
00:05:54.961 --> 00:05:58.010
The lights go out. Thousands of people are in the dark

97
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.660
<v 3>around here.</v>

98
00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:58.841
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

99
00:05:58.841 --> 00:06:02.950
we talk about the flooding of Newburgh and we've got historic camps that were

100
00:06:02.951 --> 00:06:05.800
built in the 70s that were pushed off the foundation.

101
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.590
<v 3>Oh Wow. And as director of public works, it's, Matt's job</v>

102
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.860
<v 4>department is a charged to the cleanup days, you know,</v>

103
00:06:12.861 --> 00:06:16.340
not only the leaf and live the breeze, the trees and the shrubs, but also the,

104
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.520
you know, the construction debris from the houses that are being gutted.

105
00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.730
And I'm actually at the disposal site right now,

106
00:06:22.731 --> 00:06:27.620
looking at a line of about 30 tractor trailer trucks that are lined up and

107
00:06:27.621 --> 00:06:29.720
getting ready to roll out. We'll start doing debris cleanup.

108
00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.460
<v 3>But, uh, well we called Matt about with the, uh,</v>

109
00:06:32.461 --> 00:06:35.700
the cleanup of something far smaller. Trust me, this,

110
00:06:35.701 --> 00:06:39.480
there is not supposed to be here far less vital right now,

111
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:42.240
but I'm sure they'll get them back where they need to be soon,

112
00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:45.360
but maybe just as important.

113
00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:48.730
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

114
00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.730
<v 4>let me, let me step back here and I'll give you a quick little history. Great.</v>

115
00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.180
Oh, so did he ever come in 1710.

116
00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.770
<v 7>Our downtown is a really beautiful six,</v>

117
00:06:58.771 --> 00:07:02.070
maybe eight square blocks where you see the beautiful porches.

118
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.350
<v 3>This is local restaurant owner,</v>

119
00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:08.170
<v 7>buddy Bengal, and our town was settled. I'm Swiss settlers.</v>

120
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:14.140
<v 4>And if you look up the meaning of Bern in Switzerland, earn means bear.</v>

121
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.310
<v 3>And so over the next 300 years they really ran with this</v>

122
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.460
high school mascots. The bear,

123
00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.520
they have the city flag that has a little black bear on it.

124
00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.540
It's like that nod to their past right where they came from. But it's also,

125
00:07:28.541 --> 00:07:30.670
they've got all these bears in the woods surrounding them.

126
00:07:30.671 --> 00:07:32.970
Simon found out a lot of bit bears in the woods. Okay.

127
00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:36.310
Largest black bear ever recorded from Craven County, North Carolina.

128
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.980
And the way this bear sort of obsession,

129
00:07:38.981 --> 00:07:43.900
one of the ways it's taken hold is that they have bare statues all over town,

130
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.590
<v 4>stay there, stand up on their hind legs.</v>

131
00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:48.530
There are about six foot tall or they're down on all fours that they're about

132
00:07:48.531 --> 00:07:53.130
three foot tall work, probably somewhere between 60 or 80 of [inaudible] out.

133
00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:54.510
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

134
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.240
<v 4>So that being said, you know, bears are everywhere,</v>

135
00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.990
<v 3>including the morning of September 14th, 2018</v>

136
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:06.110
<v 2>yeah,</v>

137
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:06.943
<v 7>hurricane,</v>

138
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.990
hurricane Florence came in and by fountain midday water started to seriously

139
00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:14.120
start rising again. Buddy Bangle.

140
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:17.540
We were up seven feet by Thursday night.

141
00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:21.200
I mean it happened in some places just extremely quick

142
00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:25.470
<v 3>and so buddy and a few other locals who get upon ourselves that we needed to go</v>

143
00:08:25.471 --> 00:08:29.880
out and help people and they would go to areas outside of the downtown and they

144
00:08:29.881 --> 00:08:31.500
were just banging on doors.

145
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:33.890
<v 7>Say, look guys, in the next six to eight hours,</v>

146
00:08:33.891 --> 00:08:36.920
this water is going to be over your head and flood your apartment.

147
00:08:36.921 --> 00:08:38.870
You need to get out now and get you a shelter.

148
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:43.130
<v 3>Meanwhile, back in the downtown with with the waters continuing to rise</v>

149
00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.210
<v 7>as close as we are to the river,</v>

150
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.790
we received a eight 10 feet in our downtown area. This

151
00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.190
<v 3>strange thing started to happen.</v>

152
00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:56.700
Those giant bear statues that had for just been looking out over the town,

153
00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.970
the rising floodwater actually managed to kick them up.

154
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.750
<v 7>Yeah, they all sit on concrete slabs. But you know,</v>

155
00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:09.580
with the amount of water we've received, a lot of them floated.

156
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:14.610
<v 3>Many of them were lifted cement and all, and we're just floating there,</v>

157
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.940
standing upright, bobbing gently along.

158
00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:23.770
<v 4>No, a lot of them, a lot of them, that foot, very just they, they moved</v>

159
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:27.670
<v 3>down the downtown through the alleyways.</v>

160
00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.440
<v 4>Um, some of us loaded just down the street.</v>

161
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:33.510
<v 3>Others floated on for blocks.</v>

162
00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.240
<v 2>Oh my God.</v>

163
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:39.830
Just closed your eyes here,

164
00:09:39.831 --> 00:09:44.600
the hurricane season. And then astonishing leap

165
00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.240
watched the parents go by

166
00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:09.610
<v 3>and then as the water recedes there gently set down and left there in these</v>

167
00:10:11.271 --> 00:10:14.720
still slightly flooded waters of the downtown.

168
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:21.030
<v 2>Wow. That's a whole new view for him.</v>

169
00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:25.060
<v 3>Photos of these bears started showing up sort of viral. Yeah,</v>

170
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:29.010
<v 2>yeah, yeah. He decided to travel.</v>

171
00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:35.560
<v 3>Local residents started posting to social media and then,</v>

172
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:36.533
<v 7>so it was</v>

173
00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:38.290
<v 3>Saturday morning.</v>

174
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:42.220
<v 7>It was the first day that the winds really had subsided and I was getting up to</v>

175
00:10:42.221 --> 00:10:44.950
just assess damage of everything that was outside. Yeah.

176
00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:46.770
<v 3>But he's at home. He wakes up in the morning,</v>

177
00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:49.320
he goes down the door of his apartment building,

178
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.390
he opens it up and it's just like

179
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:56.060
<v 7>my God, this town has just been destroyed. I've got branches everywhere.</v>

180
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:57.590
<v 3>The rain is still lashing</v>

181
00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.560
<v 7>and there was a lot of debris and stuff flying. And</v>

182
00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:04.760
<v 3>when he looks just right in front of him, right outside the doorway,</v>

183
00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:05.773
right there

184
00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:10.160
<v 7>on its side and kind of a little bit of a puddle of water is a bear.</v>

185
00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:16.180
<v 3>One of those floating bear statues had ended up at his apartment. Wow.</v>

186
00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:20.110
And he immediately recognizes it as the city hall.

187
00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:21.293
<v 7>Okay.</v>

188
00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:25.010
So you have on there a lot of the colors and scenes from the city of Newburn

189
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:26.180
that you have on their opposite. Yeah.

190
00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:29.810
<v 3>Back of the bear is painted yellow, like the new Bern flag.</v>

191
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:34.430
The middle of the bear is painted with the North Carolina state flag and then

192
00:11:34.431 --> 00:11:37.160
the shoulders and head of the bear are red, white and blue.

193
00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.650
<v 7>And that bear represents our entire city.</v>

194
00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:40.803
<v 3>And there it was</v>

195
00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.220
<v 7>right in front of my doors. Yup.</v>

196
00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.770
And a gentleman happened to just be walking by in the street.

197
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.310
Who was lived about a block block and a half away from me.

198
00:11:50.311 --> 00:11:52.350
And he helped me pick the bear up. He

199
00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:55.930
<v 3>grabs the back, the other guy grabbed the front legs front back,</v>

200
00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.330
whichever they grab, they march it across this,

201
00:11:58.331 --> 00:12:01.060
I'm presumed to be probably still six inches of water,

202
00:12:01.061 --> 00:12:02.720
sort of washing through the street and,

203
00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:07.000
and Florence is like not done right cause it's sat over the coast for a while.

204
00:12:07.001 --> 00:12:10.750
So the winds have gone down, but like the rains were still torrential.

205
00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:13.940
There was like, I mean, flood watches a week out. Yeah.

206
00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:15.360
We were trying to figure out what to do with it.

207
00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:20.580
<v 7>And there's a Bush right behind city hall with a little bit of an alleyway in</v>

208
00:12:20.581 --> 00:12:22.470
between the Bush and the building.

209
00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:26.850
So we put the bear in between there because we knew it would be hidden enough.

210
00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:31.620
<v 4>Yeah, buddy paid. Um, he took the bear back across city hall. It could,</v>

211
00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.540
could've been, had some bushes and then on, not

212
00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:38.680
<v 3>a few days later, they're actually getting ready for president Trump was going.</v>

213
00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:41.890
And so Matt Montaner, I was the director.

214
00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:47.020
Head of public works goes down to city hall to like prepare it.

215
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.230
<v 4>I was asked to go down there and make sure we had a flag on city hall and make</v>

216
00:12:50.231 --> 00:12:53.410
sure it was flying high. And why wouldn't remember we took a couple,

217
00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.960
<v 3>he and his team, they spot the bear, go over to it.</v>

218
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:58.300
<v 4>So two of us were, we'll pick it up very easily.</v>

219
00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:01.480
<v 3>They pick up the bear, they march it to the platform.</v>

220
00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:06.490
<v 4>Oh, set it back on the concrete pedestal like it was and then a bolter screw one</v>

221
00:13:06.491 --> 00:13:09.520
side of it into the bear's foot and then put the other side into the concrete

222
00:13:09.521 --> 00:13:12.260
slab. And we actually did that on all four of the legs

223
00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:16.050
<v 3>and they step back and take a,</v>

224
00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:17.680
take a breath for a moment.

225
00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:20.980
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

226
00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:25.390
<v 3>and then they raise a new American flag and they move on.</v>

227
00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:31.470
<v 9>Is he wiping a tear away? No, I'm just the GI.</v>

228
00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:35.170
But I know it's nice when you,

229
00:13:35.171 --> 00:13:39.220
when you have something that represents your heart,

230
00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:44.770
as odd as it may be to be a painted plasticine there image.

231
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:48.250
But still that's quilt. We're back. Oh,

232
00:13:48.251 --> 00:13:52.570
we aren't over to quote man, this guy g you're still there.

233
00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:54.653
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

234
00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:56.750
<v 4>when you look at the grand scheme of it, bears</v>

235
00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.800
know it's not that important, but you know,

236
00:14:00.801 --> 00:14:04.280
it kind of symbolizes that we're putting new bird back together.

237
00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:07.860
<v 7>We need, you need a symbol to get behind.</v>

238
00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:12.030
And our symbol in this city are the bears.

239
00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:16.373
<v 10>[inaudible]</v>

240
00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:20.733
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

241
00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:23.353
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

242
00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:29.030
<v 3>that's one burned down alone. The Gov</v>

243
00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:35.763
<v 10>[inaudible]</v>

244
00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:40.820
<v 3>wow. All right. So [inaudible] no bears. Bears.</v>

245
00:14:40.821 --> 00:14:44.200
Bears. So what's, uh,

246
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:47.750
that was number one [inaudible] story number. What's next? What's next? Oh,

247
00:14:47.751 --> 00:14:51.980
we have, well, who is Pat Walters and Bethel Hab. And

248
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.400
<v 11>what, uh, well remains remains to be seen. Let me do this. Should we,</v>

249
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:59.420
should we talk about this thing? Yes. Talk about the thing. Okay. Yeah.

250
00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:04.820
So this is a story about right park right here. Right behind it is Bob cat,

251
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:10.010
this guy named rob. Hi. Hello. Hey, really nice to meet you.

252
00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:12.310
That's somebody should call that. Hey Fat.

253
00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:16.100
And he's freaking rob is who exactly.

254
00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:20.300
<v 12>Uh, Rob Devin is a comedy writer. He worked in the city for a really long time,</v>

255
00:15:20.301 --> 00:15:23.540
like 10 years plus working for the Colbert report. Oh Wow.

256
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:26.420
Just basically like a high rise living city guy. Yeah.

257
00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.300
<v 11>But about a year and a half ago, he and his spouse, sandy moved upstate and,</v>

258
00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:33.890
great, I'll thank you. It's been rainy the last couple of days, but uh,

259
00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:35.660
stuff is happening. Yeah.

260
00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.140
<v 12>They bought a little White House with a big yard and the Beautiful Mountain</v>

261
00:15:39.141 --> 00:15:39.974
Ridge in the distance,

262
00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:42.760
<v 11>but when it gets really rainy it gets super foggy and then it sort of</v>

263
00:15:42.761 --> 00:15:46.660
disappears. Yeah. The way that sometimes like a building would in Manhattan.

264
00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:51.750
Yeah. You're relating things to building stone. That's all I got. Good does dog.

265
00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:55.180
And pretty quickly after they get there,

266
00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:58.120
they realize there's all this food growing in their yard.

267
00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:00.820
They have apple trees and then they find a pear tree,

268
00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.980
<v 12>squash and Kale and Pumpkin Tompkins.</v>

269
00:16:03.981 --> 00:16:06.270
And how's the garden of Eden? Yeah.

270
00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:11.370
Had you ever had trees that grew from fruit or food before? No.

271
00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:16.430
And right in the center of this yard is the peach tree

272
00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.400
<v 11>and we had so many pieces.</v>

273
00:16:19.401 --> 00:16:24.080
I think we pulled like 200 off this tree and made jam and Pie and saw Sandy's

274
00:16:24.081 --> 00:16:26.660
and amazing pie baker and so we had a ton of pie.

275
00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.450
<v 12>So the next,</v>

276
00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:32.590
the next year rolls around and Robin is like rubbing his hands together.

277
00:16:32.591 --> 00:16:35.310
Like yes it's peach time,

278
00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:38.540
<v 11>you know that they're ready because they come off when you're gently tug at them</v>

279
00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:40.520
and if they are not coming off yet, they're not ready yet.

280
00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:45.470
So it was in the part where we were like waiting and ready for it to start to

281
00:16:45.471 --> 00:16:45.980
happen.

282
00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:50.750
When he hears sandy yell from the back of the house,

283
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:54.040
Eh, it's a bear. So he jumps up,

284
00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:58.660
goes to the back window and sees it was a bear. It was a, it was a,

285
00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:03.690
I mean you can't mistaken sitting there sitting like Winnie the Pooh on its butt

286
00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:08.380
and it was just reaching up.

287
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:12.190
I'm all lazy to the tree and it was pulling off a peach and it would like look

288
00:17:12.191 --> 00:17:14.800
at it and we'll put it in its mouth.

289
00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:17.800
Then it would drop a pit and then would reach up for another one.

290
00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:22.270
It was just having the time of its life and I love that it's sitting.

291
00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:24.340
Not only was it sitting, it's backwards to me,

292
00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:28.870
which I found also very upsetting in ways that I couldn't totally articulate it

293
00:17:28.871 --> 00:17:30.070
at a time. I was like,

294
00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:35.100
you need to be more aware of the fact that you've come to someone's house taking

295
00:17:36.521 --> 00:17:37.190
their food

296
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:41.630
<v 12>and so he jumps up, he grabs this tambourine that he uses to punish his cat.</v>

297
00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:46.660
<v 11>So I grabbed it and I ran outside and I started shaking it like one of them took</v>

298
00:17:47.751 --> 00:17:50.250
a video of it and then Sandy,

299
00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:53.700
<v 12>who's fast is like by the house, we'll thing like a dog.</v>

300
00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:57.803
<v 13>Yeah</v>

301
00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:04.300
<v 12>and like, oh no, the bear totally freaked out,</v>

302
00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:06.750
booked it back into the woods.

303
00:18:06.751 --> 00:18:11.751
That way they walk up to the peach tree and the tree has been like massacred the

304
00:18:11.881 --> 00:18:14.220
parts of this tree that are six feet or below.

305
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:18.360
We're pretty much stripped of peaches and there's just all these peach pits and

306
00:18:18.361 --> 00:18:23.070
like half eaten peaches scattered around and every one of those is like a peach

307
00:18:23.071 --> 00:18:25.920
that they're not going to have like a pie crumble that they're not going to

308
00:18:25.921 --> 00:18:27.720
have. What was the feeling that you had

309
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:29.370
<v 11>just, hi,</v>

310
00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:34.650
it's loss and an end determination?

311
00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:39.120
I was like, no, I can't. I don't want this to keep happening at this point.

312
00:18:39.121 --> 00:18:42.960
I see the pieces that are left and I would like them to be ours.

313
00:18:42.961 --> 00:18:46.200
I think the bears had its fill and this has to stop now.

314
00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:49.190
<v 12>So they go back inside and rob immediately.</v>

315
00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:52.970
Google's like how to deter bears and then at some point they come across a

316
00:18:52.971 --> 00:18:57.971
website that says the one thing that bears are very afraid of is human voices.

317
00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:58.873
Yeah. So

318
00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:03.960
<v 11>like I think that what I need to do is make a giant playlist of podcasts and</v>

319
00:19:04.981 --> 00:19:05.510
play it.

320
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:06.920
<v 12>A podcast. Yeah.</v>

321
00:19:06.921 --> 00:19:11.921
And so he takes this old iPhone with a broken screen and he begins to build this

322
00:19:13.581 --> 00:19:17.150
spare deterring podcast device.

323
00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:18.330
<v 11>I have a telescope,</v>

324
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:21.480
has a mechanical mount that I had one of those little power banks that you can

325
00:19:21.481 --> 00:19:23.490
get to charge your phone when you travel and stuff.

326
00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:26.820
And then a Bluetooth speaker that I connected directly to the phone

327
00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:31.290
<v 12>and he covers that whole thing with a recycling bin on top of these logs.</v>

328
00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:36.560
So he hooks the whole thing up and he loads it with the entire catalog of reply

329
00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:38.370
all

330
00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:41.790
<v 14>from gimlet. Is there a bio and PJ Vogt and I'm Allen School.</v>

331
00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:48.860
<v 12>Oh, this is a show about the internet. Oh my goodness.</v>

332
00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:53.610
Like the two most citified Brooklyn kids reply all is this podcast by these two

333
00:19:53.611 --> 00:19:57.420
guys, PJ Vogt and Alex Goldman and a whole bunch of amazing producers.

334
00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.510
Absolutely. An entire team of incredible people who produced the show.

335
00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.630
But Anyway, yeah, rob just happens to like reply all.

336
00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:08.180
It was something that we were comfortable with. Yes,

337
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:13.010
you can take this week. I love imagining PJ now,

338
00:20:13.011 --> 00:20:16.620
Alex just talking to no guard.

339
00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.260
So, uh,

340
00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:24.660
mainly I'm just curious what you thought about your podcast being used as a

341
00:20:24.661 --> 00:20:27.780
scarecrow. How do you feel about that Alex?

342
00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:30.270
I thought like I thought it was great. Like I thought the only,

343
00:20:30.271 --> 00:20:33.700
I thought that they were very limited ranges of application for this show.

344
00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.800
I'd like for our show to be like the duct tape of podcasts.

345
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:39.540
You can do all kinds of stuff with it. Yeah.

346
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.490
So far we've only figured out the to listen to it scare barriers,

347
00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:48.820
but you also start like there's one aspect of reply all that might be

348
00:20:48.821 --> 00:20:52.450
particularly effective at scaring away a bear.

349
00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:56.870
Just the last, the last one,

350
00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:01.030
<v 11>PJ's laugh. Just imagining a bear that was like,</v>

351
00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:04.410
I don't think it's people and I'm going to walk a little close to her.

352
00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:05.890
I'm going to approach this tree. And then it was like,

353
00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:09.220
oh that might be a little extra pop.

354
00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:16.630
<v 12>I do have the like I do mostly feel like I feel like I'm supposed to feel bad</v>

355
00:21:16.631 --> 00:21:17.860
about, but I mostly feel good about it.

356
00:21:17.861 --> 00:21:20.080
Like I mostly feel good that it's just like useful.

357
00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.880
It's useful in a very stupid way. Right. I'd like for her.

358
00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:27.550
Well the terrible irony is here's the city boy who escaped the city Lynch,

359
00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:31.170
the live with the peace and quiet and then as his peace and quiet invaded and

360
00:21:31.171 --> 00:21:33.720
turns it back into a city. It's, yeah, I mean there, there,

361
00:21:33.721 --> 00:21:36.450
there it's like Brooklyn just to kind of followed him up there.

362
00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:40.740
Guy With the radio going on too loud. It was convertible.

363
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:45.110
I'm sure though it kind of felt reassuring to have that like going in the

364
00:21:45.111 --> 00:21:49.070
background, you know that your bear deterring machine is doing its job.

365
00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:53.800
<v 11>It was an instinctual choice that I felt like continually revealed itself to be</v>

366
00:21:53.801 --> 00:21:56.740
the right one. Yeah, so he goes out, he checks that first morning,

367
00:21:57.130 --> 00:22:00.550
the peaches are all safe, goes out in the evening, reply all,

368
00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:01.960
continuing to play.

369
00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.150
<v 12>Hey Jean, Jean, how are you?</v>

370
00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:09.160
Next day he goes out and there's no sign of any bears and he gets like 10

371
00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:12.430
peaches off the tree and then the next day no bears again.

372
00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:16.030
But I don't feel the treat in my bones. The way you,

373
00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:20.500
TJ and Alex are still talking about the Internet and there's like 20 peaches off

374
00:22:20.501 --> 00:22:22.030
the tree. So over the days,

375
00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:25.960
how many peaches did he capture from the Bayer? Well,

376
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:31.070
he had counted that the bear had eaten about 40 peaches based on the piss.

377
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:35.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we had kind of counted in his rage, you know,

378
00:22:35.081 --> 00:22:37.020
as he was cleaning up this, the mess,

379
00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:39.160
how many peaches the bear had taken from him.

380
00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:43.270
<v 11>The way it shook out I got, we got about as many peaches as the bear did.</v>

381
00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:47.970
<v 12>He thinks that he and sandy got like 40 pitches too. So like five,</v>

382
00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:52.870
10 Pepsi. Then he's thinking I win or at least I didn't lose. We tied.

383
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.870
And so anyway, he, he ends up writing this entire story on Twitter,

384
00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:00.150
<v 11>on Twitter. And I was like, this is a story of how,</v>

385
00:23:00.151 --> 00:23:04.110
what's happening in my yard right now. And if it got a big response,

386
00:23:04.111 --> 00:23:05.820
and I was a little surprised,

387
00:23:05.821 --> 00:23:09.300
I think at the number of people who took the bear side.

388
00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:12.810
But I was like, well that's the problem.

389
00:23:12.811 --> 00:23:15.780
Why can't the bear have some not enough pages for you? Like

390
00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:18.730
bear apologists? Yeah.

391
00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:23.880
<v 12>Do they understand that there are other food sources then the one peach tree and</v>

392
00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:28.480
rob Dublin's yard like I clearly, no, no. Yeah.

393
00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:35.760
The way I see it as like if rob had domesticated the bear raised it to only

394
00:23:36.101 --> 00:23:38.890
understand that food gave from that tree and then sent it out into the woods,

395
00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:42.040
they would be justified. But other than that, that's ridiculous.

396
00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:46.610
I am not taking the bear [inaudible]. I am about like the morality

397
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:50.580
<v 0>of it. It's just the bare doesn't like reply off broad does like reply all.</v>

398
00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:54.110
That's like very straight forward for me. Rob gets the peaches.

399
00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:58.370
Do you think on any level the bear like got something out of listening to the

400
00:23:58.371 --> 00:24:01.970
show? No. No.

401
00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:08.390
I don't know. We just don't design it with bears in mind.

402
00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:11.540
What would a show designed with bears in mind? Sound like

403
00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:14.013
[inaudible] radio lab.

404
00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:21.980
Oh my God.

405
00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:26.740
Is that spin off radio lab for bears or bears? Yes.

406
00:24:26.741 --> 00:24:29.890
We've been under sort of estimating the size of my bear audience.

407
00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:33.820
Listen real talk here. Okay. Do we like bears? We like we, we,

408
00:24:33.821 --> 00:24:36.820
we could do many more episodes. I go in particular,

409
00:24:36.821 --> 00:24:40.510
we've run across so many in and they are staff is run across so many things

410
00:24:40.511 --> 00:24:43.150
about bears that we've got. We've got a whole bear season.

411
00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:45.520
We could do [inaudible] or we could lead to that.

412
00:24:45.521 --> 00:24:50.170
We could just decide that right now. We could, we can make, could try again.

413
00:24:50.171 --> 00:24:53.500
See if with anybody in the house who's going to do a non, yes, we are still,

414
00:24:53.501 --> 00:24:56.210
we have two more. Okay. So next up, um,

415
00:24:56.470 --> 00:25:01.180
is Matt Kielty and Rachel Q sick with breaking news. I hope we'll see.

416
00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:05.710
Right. You just want us to go barreling men to this or something. Yeah, yeah.

417
00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:09.670
Go. Okay. Well if we start all the way at the tip top,

418
00:25:09.671 --> 00:25:14.550
we drove out to um, Oak Ridge, New Jersey. Yep.

419
00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:18.990
Which is about an hour and a half west of the city here. Okay.

420
00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:24.270
Drove out for a story about a bear. Surprisingly. Who would have thought good.

421
00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:27.780
I've definitely heard dogs barking in the video. Oh. Oh, that's a dog.

422
00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:31.570
But not just any bear. A famous bear. The most famous bear you could say. Yeah.

423
00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:36.960
Hi. How's it going? My Name's Matt. I'm Rachel. We're reporters. Uh,

424
00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:40.410
so we, um, we showed up totally unannounced at this house.

425
00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:45.300
A woman answers the door. A little suspicious. We explain who we are. Hi Matt.

426
00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:50.120
I'm Marissa. Then should we get her name? It's a Marissa. Marissa McCowen. Hi.

427
00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:54.090
We need her husband Greg, who just gotten home from work. Rachel? Yes. Hi.

428
00:25:54.091 --> 00:25:57.270
Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you as well. Nice to meet Ya.

429
00:25:57.330 --> 00:26:00.030
So Greg walked us around in the backyard. It was really beautiful.

430
00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:04.530
Where there's this huge forest. Yeah, this is gorgeous. And then

431
00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:09.840
we try this. The kids are playing. Thanks so much. Let us into his basement.

432
00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:14.730
Let's go in there. Oh, shut your door. Try to keep it more, somewhat isolated.

433
00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:19.060
Okay, sure, sure. Okay. Oh, that sounds great. Church giving me two minutes. So,

434
00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:24.370
um, yeah, I guess a, we were just curiously, I mean,

435
00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.160
Marisa was telling us a little bit about the first time she saw the bear.

436
00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:30.520
Like when, when did you, did she tell you about that? When did you first, yeah,

437
00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:34.750
my wife saw him the first time I'd caught up just a glimpse of him. But uh,

438
00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:37.150
at the time I videotaped it was actually the third time I saw him.

439
00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:41.740
So it's the summer of 2014 it was a, it was a weekday. It was nighttime.

440
00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:46.420
It was about six o'clock at night. So, and I was hanging out on my deck when,

441
00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:47.823
<v 2>Nope,</v>

442
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.290
<v 0>he sees this bear coming from the woods up towards the street, a black bear.</v>

443
00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:56.990
So I ran out, I grabbed my cell phone and just started videotaping with an old,

444
00:26:56.991 --> 00:27:00.400
a Samsung note three. It's like a shaky video.

445
00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:04.720
Greg started just like painting the phone all over the place to try to find it

446
00:27:04.721 --> 00:27:04.930
with the [inaudible]

447
00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:08.860
<v 2>phone. Marissa's outside? Yeah,</v>

448
00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:12.940
<v 0>it's another video. Oh, so she's taking the video too.</v>

449
00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:15.510
She's got a video of me taking a video of the bear. I don't see it.

450
00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:20.340
<v 2>So if you started</v>

451
00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:24.480
<v 0>walking up his front yard, he's going down his driveway and he's looking,</v>

452
00:27:24.481 --> 00:27:27.990
he's still looking for this bear and really like you just see a little picture s

453
00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:30.660
like slice of suburban America. It's just like some,

454
00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:35.730
you see some trees of road green grass everywhere and then there it is.

455
00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:36.683
There it is.

456
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:42.350
All of a sudden Gregg zooms in on this like Hillary blob that is moving across

457
00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:48.720
his neighbor's driveway and at in screening.

458
00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:53.810
But what you see is this black bear that is a bipedal bear walking on its hind

459
00:27:55.291 --> 00:27:59.460
legs walking across the street like a human. Oh my God.

460
00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:02.850
Wait, that's the bear. That's the bear.

461
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:07.050
So the bear is just straight up walking on two feet.

462
00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:10.410
You could totally be like a kid in a bear suit. Like it's like, yeah.

463
00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:12.600
Actually the first time I saw it I was like,

464
00:28:12.601 --> 00:28:16.530
that is what my dad looks like when he stumbles out of the hallway in the middle

465
00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:19.860
of the night without his glasses on. But still motoring. Yeah,

466
00:28:19.861 --> 00:28:24.510
it's motoring and also sort of puttering. Puttering with purpose. Okay,

467
00:28:24.511 --> 00:28:29.230
so gray, gray, gray, gray, gray, gray, gray. [inaudible]. Yeah.

468
00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:31.670
Okay, so Greg's filming this whole thing. Yeah.

469
00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:36.200
I'm over in the front yard of my house watching this walking bear,

470
00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:40.110
but that's when I see him walk up my neighbor's driveway into the street walking

471
00:28:40.111 --> 00:28:40.800
towards me.

472
00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:45.450
I am walking backwards and the bears to the parents of crossing the street over

473
00:28:45.451 --> 00:28:47.880
into another neighbor's front yard,

474
00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:52.920
walk into the front yard right now and I'm somewhere off campus.

475
00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:54.253
<v 2>Marilyn</v>

476
00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:57.780
<v 0>here, their neighbor.</v>

477
00:28:58.100 --> 00:28:59.380
<v 2>Does she know that you're there?</v>

478
00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:01.370
<v 0>You know that the bear, right?</v>

479
00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:07.110
<v 2>Just look out man.</v>

480
00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:16.613
Yes. Okay.

481
00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:23.953
[inaudible]

482
00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:27.990
<v 0>the video lasts for about three minutes and then</v>

483
00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:31.020
Greg stops recording.

484
00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:37.790
So we got the video, we watched it go through the woods and stuff. I go inside,

485
00:29:37.791 --> 00:29:40.430
I start giving the kids baths and stuff and I just take it and I want to share

486
00:29:40.431 --> 00:29:42.760
it with some people. I throw it on Youtube, you know,

487
00:29:42.761 --> 00:29:44.260
and a half hour later after an uploads,

488
00:29:44.261 --> 00:29:47.110
I go and send out a couple of emails to like some friends and family.

489
00:29:47.111 --> 00:29:50.710
Just be like, Hey, I saw this weird wild Beyer walking. I'm like,

490
00:29:50.711 --> 00:29:53.410
check it out and that's it. Go to bed.

491
00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:55.780
And then the next day

492
00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:57.700
<v 10>Greg</v>

493
00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:01.900
<v 0>checks his phone and I start seeing my emails popping up again and again and</v>

494
00:30:01.901 --> 00:30:04.660
again and again. And it's people from viral media companies,

495
00:30:04.661 --> 00:30:05.680
it's family members.

496
00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:08.850
Somebody put it on Facebook and it was spreading on Facebook and yeah

497
00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.260
<v 10>know I was blown away.</v>

498
00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:16.250
<v 3>But then all these other people start putting up videos because this bear is</v>

499
00:30:16.251 --> 00:30:20.960
being spotted all over town. Some of the videos are like of the bear,

500
00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:23.450
awesome. Coming out at like nighttime or like dinnertime,

501
00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:26.840
like walking in and out of the woods. Biggie walks back to the new dawn,

502
00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:29.690
but there's also videos of this bear just like strolling down neighborhood

503
00:30:29.691 --> 00:30:33.850
streets pop in his head into garbage cans, going through people's back yards.

504
00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:37.610
It was like underneath this woman's deck. It was amazing.

505
00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:41.320
He would come like right there, you know right there.

506
00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:44.240
And the two of them were like 20 feet away. He looked up at me,

507
00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:48.200
they made eye contact. Then the bear gets stolen.

508
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:51.770
There's a Piertri over there showed up across the street from this woman's

509
00:30:51.771 --> 00:30:56.000
house. And we saw him one time, they're getting the pears out of the tree.

510
00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:00.350
It was great to see him, you know, because he's so famous.

511
00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:05.690
This spear is amazing. Everyone, he walks on two legs, eventually folks in town,

512
00:31:05.691 --> 00:31:09.200
give him the name pedals, pedals from the word bike pedal.

513
00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:10.580
He hit like Good Morning America,

514
00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:13.400
Bonnie today walking tall and like all the national news,

515
00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:17.350
a black bear walking on his leg. He walks on his hind leg.

516
00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:21.740
[inaudible] agility and ease. Any human, completely upright like a human.

517
00:31:21.741 --> 00:31:24.740
And everybody's just kinda like, oh my gosh. Like what a fun, cute,

518
00:31:24.741 --> 00:31:27.500
adorable animal doing something that looks like a human. That's so fun.

519
00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:32.650
<v 10>Well, sort of everyone. No,</v>

520
00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:37.700
<v 3>which is where we get to Lisa. Hi, I'm Maiko.</v>

521
00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.270
So basically we heard about Lisa,

522
00:31:43.271 --> 00:31:47.650
she was like a big player in this whole like love affair with pedals.

523
00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:52.720
So we go, we go inside, we sit down under dining room table. Okay. Like, wait,

524
00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:56.650
when did you first learn of the bear? Um,

525
00:31:56.710 --> 00:32:00.040
I don't remember the exact date. I know I even have a hard time with years,

526
00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:04.450
but I think it was in 2014 that she was on Facebook.

527
00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:09.480
I saw a post about this bear and he was in a video walking by and I was like,

528
00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:14.080
oh my God, this is so sad. Like you didn't think it was like funnier. No,

529
00:32:14.081 --> 00:32:17.350
I thought it was sad. Why does the video make her sad? Well,

530
00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:21.730
so Lisa actually works in animal rescue and she explained that, you know,

531
00:32:21.731 --> 00:32:26.140
so rather than being like, just in awe of it, like whoa. For her,

532
00:32:26.141 --> 00:32:30.490
when she watched the video, what she saw was a bear that was injured. Yeah.

533
00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:34.300
So the thing is that if you look at some screenshots of pedals close up,

534
00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:39.100
you'll see he really had no hands. One was like amputated.

535
00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:41.360
I was like a stub. It was like pretty much missing.

536
00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:44.570
And the other one was just broken, mangled.

537
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:49.640
And Lisa said that's why he walked on his hind legs. I mean,

538
00:32:49.641 --> 00:32:52.760
I'm sure he ate whatever berries or whatever he could get.

539
00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:56.450
But Lisa said it was probably because he couldn't use his paws is why he was

540
00:32:56.451 --> 00:32:59.210
walking around these neighborhoods because he was starving and he couldn't feed

541
00:32:59.211 --> 00:33:02.510
himself. And so her first thought was, we have to help this bear.

542
00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:07.820
So she gets in touch with a couple of women, they start a go fund me campaign,

543
00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:09.163
Help Save pedals,

544
00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:13.580
raised $25,000 in like four days to basically dart him,

545
00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:17.000
transport them and house them at this place called the wildlife orphanage.

546
00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:19.100
There's a couple other wild bears there,

547
00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:23.510
couple of team like retired circus bears, if you will. There's a pond,

548
00:33:23.511 --> 00:33:26.600
a lot of trees and it's private, you know, it's not a zoo.

549
00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:30.860
So the very last thing they had to do was petition the state of New Jersey to

550
00:33:30.861 --> 00:33:31.371
just, you know,

551
00:33:31.371 --> 00:33:35.540
like do it because that's against the law for us to just start a bear and put

552
00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:36.800
him in a truck and take them.

553
00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:40.070
So they get this petition going and ends up going like around the world,

554
00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:45.080
like 400,000 signatures. Yeah, they send it off to the state.

555
00:33:45.081 --> 00:33:49.310
We're all ready to go. Everything was in place. And the state says,

556
00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:55.350
<v 12>no, we're not doing that really well.</v>

557
00:33:55.351 --> 00:33:58.260
So I got in touch with the press people at j d, e p,

558
00:33:58.261 --> 00:34:01.650
which is like the Environmental Department of New Jersey.

559
00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:05.790
And basically they said, we have no interest in commenting on this.

560
00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:08.520
Why would they not even comment?

561
00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:13.260
Well I think you can understand that if you know the rest of the story of

562
00:34:13.261 --> 00:34:17.970
pedals. Yeah, there's a lot more to this story that you don't know. All right,

563
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.820
let's hear the rest then. Um,

564
00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:20.321
<v 15>okay. Well,</v>

565
00:34:20.321 --> 00:34:24.580
so what you basically have is you have a collision of two ideas about black

566
00:34:24.581 --> 00:34:26.440
bears and what they are and what they need.

567
00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:31.030
<v 12>Okay. So that's John Wellum at large with the New York Times magazine.</v>

568
00:34:31.450 --> 00:34:32.060
Longtime pedals fan.

569
00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:36.230
<v 15>Yeah. More. Um, I knew more about as earlier work, like before he got famous,</v>

570
00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:38.520
<v 12>he's written a lot about animals, including petals and,</v>

571
00:34:38.521 --> 00:34:43.220
and John explained to us that what you had was this divide where on the one side

572
00:34:43.221 --> 00:34:46.010
you had people like Lisa, who when they looked at the bear,

573
00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:50.180
they thought that their needed help. It's injured, seems to be struggling.

574
00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:53.360
We got to get it out there. But on the other side,

575
00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:54.980
you have the state of New Jersey.

576
00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:59.960
<v 15>And they came at it from a completely different viewpoint where they,</v>

577
00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:01.640
uh, you know,

578
00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:05.960
were just as interested in quote unquote helping the bear and making sure that

579
00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:10.940
the bear could, you know, uh, live, it's, I don't know,

580
00:35:10.941 --> 00:35:13.040
best life I suppose you'd say. And uh,

581
00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:15.800
but they wanted to go about it in a very different way as far as they were

582
00:35:15.801 --> 00:35:19.330
concerned. It wasn't, it was a wild animal. Uh, and you,

583
00:35:19.331 --> 00:35:23.750
you don't take a wild animal out of the wild unless absolutely necessary.

584
00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:26.490
<v 12>And the fact that you saw this, Bayer walking on two legs,</v>

585
00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:30.450
<v 15>they basically saw the bipedal bear is a real survivor.</v>

586
00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:33.910
<v 12>This is like a feat of evolution. Like this bear evolved to survive.</v>

587
00:35:33.911 --> 00:35:36.700
We should just let him do his thing. He was still out there being a bear.

588
00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:37.830
So we're to leave the bear there.

589
00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:42.090
<v 3>Hmm. It's the right thing to do. So this is, uh,</v>

590
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:46.820
this is the part of the story about pedals that we, we haven't told you yet. Um,

591
00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:50.600
so pedals was first found in 2014 for showed up,

592
00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:54.140
showed up again the next summer, and then showed up even 16. Yeah,

593
00:35:54.141 --> 00:35:56.990
even early 2016 there are videos of pedals and then nothing,

594
00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:02.190
and then a bear that had become a national sensation is dead.

595
00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:06.450
The bear known as pedals. So in October of 2016,

596
00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:09.210
news broke that pedals had been killed.

597
00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:13.320
Kale during a bear hunt on Monday we told you about in the annual bear hunt that

598
00:36:13.321 --> 00:36:17.310
takes place in New Jersey in pretty quick a familiar story.

599
00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:20.760
<v 16>It's played out growing outrageous mourning over the apparent killing of a</v>

600
00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:23.880
famous black bear. There was anger, protest,

601
00:36:23.881 --> 00:36:28.260
death threats against whoever may have killed the bear hit piece of shit.

602
00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:32.280
Death threats against an innocent hunter against himself. His family,

603
00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:36.120
people have actually threatened to burn down his business there people posted

604
00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:40.440
photos of his home, his wife's name. In the midst of all of this,

605
00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:44.280
I think everybody out there should be going after the state of New Jersey.

606
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:46.500
People were angry at the state,

607
00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:51.260
state in New Jersey did nothing about the bear. Where were the DPA? When people,

608
00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:55.460
<v 3>where did this therapy injured for years that this is their fault?</v>

609
00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:56.360
Where were they then?

610
00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:07.430
That was so rough.

611
00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:10.530
<v 13>Yeah. Yeah.</v>

612
00:37:11.890 --> 00:37:13.570
<v 3>I had my moment, you know,</v>

613
00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:18.800
but people sent me bear things, you know, like I have,

614
00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:22.130
I have like the little sea, the bear on top of the radio.

615
00:37:22.131 --> 00:37:27.131
And Sabrina got me a picture that looked just like pedals from UN beautiful,

616
00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:29.870
um, artists that doesn't even know pedals,

617
00:37:29.871 --> 00:37:34.430
but made this picture of a bear that looks just like I'm and just cool.

618
00:37:34.431 --> 00:37:38.090
And so she gave me one of though, you know, it's just nice. People thought,

619
00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:40.340
you know, they saw how hard we fought.

620
00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:42.040
<v 13>Yeah.</v>

621
00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:46.810
<v 3>Yeah. But the book is the best. It really is. And what's the writer's name?</v>

622
00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:51.490
John Malala. Yeah, I talked to him. He was nice. Nice guy. Yeah,

623
00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:53.970
I remember being like, you want to what?

624
00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:58.390
So John Actually wrote an obituary for pedals.

625
00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:01.150
You have a copy of the magazine, but yeah. That's cool.

626
00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:02.350
That's just look really quick.

627
00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:06.010
And then you guys can use for the New York Times magazine's annual lives.

628
00:38:06.011 --> 00:38:09.280
They lived issue. Yeah. Got It.

629
00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:12.880
<v 15>I just, I just thought, you know, the way I've always, you know, I,</v>

630
00:38:12.881 --> 00:38:16.580
I've always thought of like the lies they lived, the Bowie picture, you know,

631
00:38:16.581 --> 00:38:21.350
it's about these people's lives. So many people, but it's also just,

632
00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:24.770
um, and you're just thing where you talk about the world that we live in.

633
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:28.710
<v 3>Janet Reno pedals the man there's pedals.</v>

634
00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:33.900
<v 15>One reason why I find conversations about animals so interesting is because the</v>

635
00:38:33.901 --> 00:38:38.620
animals always have no right that there you basically have groups of human

636
00:38:38.621 --> 00:38:39.454
beings

637
00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:45.620
<v 0>[inaudible] standing around this like a little screenshot object at pedal</v>

638
00:38:46.041 --> 00:38:47.370
standing. Yeah.

639
00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:51.130
<v 15>Uh, trying to, uh, figure out what to do with it,</v>

640
00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:54.390
<v 0>walking towards a mailbox, just fetching the mail. Yeah.</v>

641
00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:57.450
And this is actually the picture that I used on his,

642
00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:03.030
our version of like rest in peace pedals for like a memorial page. Yeah.

643
00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:05.073
<v 10>Yeah.</v>

644
00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:07.540
<v 15>Um, yeah. I don't know. I mean, do you want me to, I felt like, uh,</v>

645
00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:09.960
do you want me just to read the end of the pieces, but yeah. Yeah,

646
00:39:09.961 --> 00:39:13.590
that'd be great. Okay. You guys impossible to know the circumstances,

647
00:39:13.591 --> 00:39:17.750
whether the hunter knew the bears identity before he or she fired whether pedals

648
00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:21.570
who did spend some time on all fours had been distinguishable from an ordinary

649
00:39:21.571 --> 00:39:22.230
bear,

650
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:25.560
whether he had been standing upright in the wilderness looking preposterous and

651
00:39:25.561 --> 00:39:29.700
conspicuous and conspicuously like himself. That is the bear's posture.

652
00:39:29.701 --> 00:39:32.910
The very proof of his resilience might've marked him for death.

653
00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:35.520
It was never clear what we owed. Pedals. Exactly.

654
00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:39.630
You could argue that allowing pedals to live in the woods and be hunted like any

655
00:39:39.631 --> 00:39:43.500
other bear with an active respect of validation of his wildness.

656
00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:48.550
You could also argue that it was a cruise in laps of human compassion pedals

657
00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:51.840
stood for something. We may never agree what it was.

658
00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:00.780
<v 10>[inaudible]</v>

659
00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:05.580
<v 0>so wait, do you guys even have, did you, there wasn't a clip in there,</v>

660
00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:08.280
you didn't use a clip from the movie. Do you have a clip from the movie? Well,

661
00:40:08.281 --> 00:40:11.820
a matter of fact, we do a, yeah,

662
00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:14.460
we got a clip or does this, where did you send that thing again?

663
00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:18.720
It's in the selects. Alright. Okay, fine. Uh, he, um,

664
00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:23.700
we call a full shit on your stupid rules.

665
00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:33.130
Play it again, Bull Shit. And yet in doing so,

666
00:40:33.131 --> 00:40:37.210
you followed it. That's right. That's the beauty of it. Yeah.

667
00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:39.190
All right. You know what we're going to do?

668
00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:41.770
We're going to take a little break or we're going to clear the air.

669
00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:43.930
We're going to come back with a couple of producers who, uh,

670
00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:48.850
who have a little bit more respect for the rules more in a moment.

683
00:41:39.310 --> 00:41:43.690
Jad, Robert Radiolab breaking bad news bears. And uh,

684
00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:46.300
we've had three bear stories so far and maybe I, you know,

685
00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:50.350
maybe this is the moment when I should admit that everybody broke for bears.

686
00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:54.680
Yeah. That was, I could see that coming choice,

687
00:41:55.870 --> 00:41:59.110
you know, and you woke up in the morning full of vim and vigor and excitement.

688
00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:02.500
What did you do the hard news or would you right away these days,

689
00:42:02.501 --> 00:42:05.330
would you do the bad news or really true like, well,

690
00:42:05.331 --> 00:42:07.710
what I was hoping actually and I was that,

691
00:42:07.810 --> 00:42:10.750
I mean admittedly Molly and Simon's had a little bit of like the hurricane and

692
00:42:10.751 --> 00:42:11.201
just come in.

693
00:42:11.201 --> 00:42:14.440
But what I was really hoping was that somebody was going to get a solid rock

694
00:42:14.441 --> 00:42:17.140
solid breaking news about bears kind of thing.

695
00:42:17.141 --> 00:42:20.710
And I actually had one in my sights that I was just sitting on waiting to see if

696
00:42:20.711 --> 00:42:25.000
anybody got it. So a, something that the Trump administration did though, uh,

697
00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:25.691
most people don't know,

698
00:42:25.691 --> 00:42:28.630
actually the seeds of it were planted during the Obama administration was that

699
00:42:28.631 --> 00:42:32.130
the grizzly bears came off the endangered species that they were do list.

700
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:33.191
And in the wake of that,

701
00:42:33.191 --> 00:42:36.100
there was about to be for the first time in almost 50 years,

702
00:42:36.101 --> 00:42:41.101
a hunt around Yellowstone because the grizzlies have gone from like,

703
00:42:41.111 --> 00:42:45.010
you know, whatever it was a hundred left to now around 700.

704
00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:49.900
They've also started encroaching on hikers, campers, hunters and ranchers.

705
00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:53.470
And so the idea is that once you do list them, which should be a success, hey,

706
00:42:53.471 --> 00:42:55.750
they came back, we can to list them now, but also at the same time,

707
00:42:55.751 --> 00:42:58.660
that means that we can start and call them or shoot them. Yeah.

708
00:42:58.661 --> 00:43:01.930
So the ranchers are geared up to get their licenses and head out there and have

709
00:43:01.931 --> 00:43:06.100
this hunt. And at the last moment, uh, there was a court case and a judge said,

710
00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:09.550
no, no, not time to do the hunt. And that happened a couple of weeks ago.

711
00:43:09.551 --> 00:43:13.870
And then that just add hunting season five days before the hunt or whatever it

712
00:43:13.871 --> 00:43:16.420
was. And what was the reasoning from the judge? It was a, I mean,

713
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:19.630
I think clearly like some activists had come to them and said,

714
00:43:20.350 --> 00:43:23.410
they're not yet ready. This will damage the population. And so, yeah,

715
00:43:23.411 --> 00:43:26.830
the judge had kind of like that maybe that the administration hadn't shown

716
00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:31.210
enough recovery to warrant hunting and,

717
00:43:31.211 --> 00:43:34.930
but that then just two days ago that that ruling got sort of like either

718
00:43:34.931 --> 00:43:36.670
confirmed or upheld or whatever it is.

719
00:43:36.671 --> 00:43:41.320
And now that functionally actually means that the grizzly is not delisted, um,

720
00:43:41.321 --> 00:43:43.360
that it is still on the endangered species list.

721
00:43:43.361 --> 00:43:47.860
And there's even some among bear concerned folk you talked to their,

722
00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:50.980
they're not quite sure what to think because if you're going to have an

723
00:43:50.981 --> 00:43:54.640
endangered species list, you need to occasionally have an animal come off of it.

724
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:56.260
Hey, you need a win, you need a win.

725
00:43:56.290 --> 00:44:00.340
Otherwise you just lose the political will to even, yeah, totally do it. Or,

726
00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:03.790
or you just show that doing it is pointless and you're going to lose them

727
00:44:03.791 --> 00:44:05.920
eventually. So you don't even never get off. Right.

728
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.200
Know that you need someone to get off. And I guess, you know,

729
00:44:08.290 --> 00:44:11.380
you could probably go back and forth for a lot about whether it's time for the

730
00:44:11.590 --> 00:44:16.210
Yellowstone grizzlies to be off or not, but um, yeah, so nobody got to that.

731
00:44:16.211 --> 00:44:16.750
But, um,

732
00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:21.750
but still we have one more story and it comes from any Macewan and lots of

733
00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:27.110
Nasser. Of course. It's about bears. I think in some ways, both really.

734
00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:28.700
This is another, it's another,

735
00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:32.130
it's not breaking news in the sense that it's recent, but it's breaking news

736
00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:36.090
<v 17>and that we're saying stuff that is true about the world that has not been</v>

737
00:44:36.091 --> 00:44:40.800
reported before. Oh, so it's breaking news about there's,

738
00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:43.530
yeah, I think so. Okay. Where, where do you start?

739
00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:50.050
<v 18>We start in the far north in the Arctic islands in Canada.</v>

740
00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:54.420
Cold this winter. You have to place, you can imagine

741
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:58.670
<v 17>with an Inu and hunter. Oh, right. Named David Qube Tanner.</v>

742
00:44:58.690 --> 00:45:03.640
<v 19>I was born in new Cocteau in Igloo in April, 1359.</v>

743
00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:09.420
And I live in a small community of 470 people and everybody knows everybody

744
00:45:10.541 --> 00:45:11.560
pretty well related.

745
00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:11.961
<v 17>Anyway,</v>

746
00:45:11.961 --> 00:45:16.460
he told us this story of a hunt that he was on that was unlike any hunt he had

747
00:45:16.461 --> 00:45:17.660
ever been on before,

748
00:45:17.810 --> 00:45:22.460
where he caught a bear that was unlike any bear he had ever seen before. Wow.

749
00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:25.730
What happened? What? April, 2010

750
00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:30.900
<v 19>me and [inaudible] hunting Burgers, a nice morning shaft. No on top.</v>

751
00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:31.830
Nice weather.

752
00:45:31.830 --> 00:45:36.210
<v 20>He and his wife set out on their skidoos I'm into is a snowmobile.</v>

753
00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:37.500
It's just what they're called up there. Yeah.

754
00:45:37.501 --> 00:45:40.110
Just sort of like the snow machines that you can, just a mechanical device.

755
00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:44.760
Yeah. Um, they hop in their skidoos they head out across the sea ice.

756
00:45:45.330 --> 00:45:47.130
Um, and they're heading towards this island that,

757
00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:49.320
that are playing in camping in this empty cabin.

758
00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:52.770
<v 19>And we got to the cabin and we're going to camp there.</v>

759
00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:55.480
But the cabin was damaged by some bears.

760
00:45:55.890 --> 00:45:57.140
<v 20>Wow. They knew that immediately. Yeah.</v>

761
00:45:57.330 --> 00:45:59.370
And then they decided let's go back to another cabin. Okay.

762
00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:03.640
<v 19>[inaudible] t and fueled up and everything was third heading back or four</v>

763
00:46:03.641 --> 00:46:07.380
o'clock in the afternoon. And as we're following the court,

764
00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:10.960
getting court to a cabin, there was a hill, um,

765
00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:14.730
equities of tracks coming down, down truck cabins,

766
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:19.560
fresh bear tracks around this cabin. It will not take the 400 going forward.

767
00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:22.290
And Honeywell coming back there. We're there. And as they approach it,

768
00:46:22.291 --> 00:46:24.810
they see that this cabin is also been ransack.

769
00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:29.220
The bear has gone in a mattress. He broke the window. K ,

770
00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:32.730
well we'll continue on and you run into another cabin.

771
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:37.740
So this is a third cabin they pass. Wow. Roped the door open later message said,

772
00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:42.530
is it normal for a polar bear to go into cabinets and throw mattresses out?

773
00:46:44.130 --> 00:46:47.970
Not Oliver. Don't really do that. So we start tracking it again.

774
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.560
We could shoot a truck, Holloway.

775
00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:54.000
And at this point they start getting a little worried because these tracks are

776
00:46:54.001 --> 00:46:58.890
coming toward the community, to your tech going fast.

777
00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:04.120
<v 20>A fourth cabin ransacked and a fifth Jesus also been through and right next to</v>

778
00:47:04.121 --> 00:47:05.860
the fifth there is a six cabin.

779
00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:10.460
<v 19>I noticed it wasn't that open. So I brought it to cartridge cap. Yeah.</v>

780
00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:14.740
<v 20>Oh, so the, this is this presumably the next destination for the bear. Right.</v>

781
00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:18.740
<v 19>So I went a little further that going around it and sure enough,</v>

782
00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:23.730
this bear was hiding. It has a cabin. He had his hedge out,

783
00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:26.770
his troop, just body and his

784
00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:30.113
so

785
00:47:31.290 --> 00:47:32.123
<v 20>chasing it</v>

786
00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:35.700
<v 19>that got kind of coated establish you.</v>

787
00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:40.710
I earn from my rifle on the sleds back on my hair or just leg standing up,

788
00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:42.060
you know?

789
00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:44.940
<v 20>And why were, why were you afraid? I don't know.</v>

790
00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:48.720
I just never run into that 10 of bed before she was used to polar Paris.

791
00:47:48.721 --> 00:47:51.930
But this bear, he just had this feeling that it was different.

792
00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:54.680
Something was off. But I take a shot at it,

793
00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:57.473
<v 19>I hit it.</v>

794
00:47:58.100 --> 00:47:59.840
<v 20>He kills the bear. He does. Okay.</v>

795
00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:05.060
[inaudible] they approach it on their skidoos they get off.

796
00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:08.960
This bear looks strange. Hmm.

797
00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:11.350
<v 19>It's a blonde bear.</v>

798
00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:14.350
I just thought your Tisha ordinary grizzly bear,

799
00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:18.850
cause I never once you catch a grizzly bear before and that was my first time

800
00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:23.640
and the legs are dark shirt, just let it got boots, shiny drawers,

801
00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:24.953
socks or whatever.

802
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.590
<v 17>He also has dark circles around his eyes. Wow. Interesting.</v>

803
00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:33.620
So he takes it back to town and he checks in with this government officer and

804
00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:35.670
this guy takes a look at it and he's like, yeah,

805
00:48:35.690 --> 00:48:40.250
<v 19>David, I think this might not be a polar bear. It might not be a grizzly bear.</v>

806
00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:42.170
It might be a hybrid bear.

807
00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:46.530
<v 17>A hybrid bear. Yeah. Like bow a little bit of both. Little bit of both.</v>

808
00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:48.630
And David had never even heard of that before.

809
00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:51.570
I have never actually heard of that. It's not a common thing that happens.

810
00:48:52.050 --> 00:48:54.090
But a few years before David's bare, right?

811
00:48:54.130 --> 00:48:57.520
<v 20>Extremely rare creature is shot and killed in the Canadian Arctic.</v>

812
00:48:57.590 --> 00:48:59.610
<v 17>First one ever was caught in [inaudible].</v>

813
00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:02.950
<v 20>Have you ever heard of a grower, a grizzly, polar bear hybrid,</v>

814
00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:04.770
<v 17>and the media is the best.</v>

815
00:49:05.130 --> 00:49:09.510
David Attenborough included two polar bears and brown bears into breeding.

816
00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:11.040
Got Really excited about it.

817
00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:15.510
So we've known for a while that it's happening out there. Wow.

818
00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:18.360
And even David has encountered a few more out there in the wild.

819
00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:23.430
<v 19>I run into a mother polar bear with two little teddy bear cup Caprisa hybrid.</v>

820
00:49:23.890 --> 00:49:24.710
So cute.

821
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:28.330
<v 17>So this is some kind of crossbreeding between these two species. But the,</v>

822
00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:33.120
the crazy twist was when, when this Guy David Coop Tonah uh, shot this thing,

823
00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:37.640
it w uh, this particular Paisley Barry sent it off for genetic testing.

824
00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:41.370
<v 19>They told me it's called the first second generation bear.</v>

825
00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:44.550
Their mother was half Oliver,

826
00:49:44.551 --> 00:49:48.090
half grizzly and the father was a full gross to me

827
00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:53.550
<v 20>bare the David shot is the first indication that these bears are fertile.</v>

828
00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:54.413
No Way.

829
00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:58.860
Which is something that you wouldn't think of a horse and a donkey say wood

830
00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:00.720
would breed together, make a mule.

831
00:50:00.721 --> 00:50:04.980
Those mules can't then have offspring will be, I thought that too

832
00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:06.950
<v 17>different speeds. Cause you're different species, right.</v>

833
00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:08.510
These are different species.

834
00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:11.540
They branch off evolutionarily like hundreds of thousands of years.

835
00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:15.340
<v 20>Pretty much the same time that we broke off from the neanderthals.</v>

836
00:50:15.341 --> 00:50:19.240
And so it'd be like us meeting in the Anatole out in the, you know,

837
00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:24.420
the crown heights bar or something and going home with that person and creating,

838
00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:26.270
creating an awesome, this

839
00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:28.070
<v 17>is a really specific, it sounds like you've had</v>

840
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:34.220
<v 4>Franklin f April 10 call me.</v>

841
00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:39.171
Wow.

842
00:50:39.171 --> 00:50:43.490
That's so they branch to the Polos and the grizzlies branch at the same time as

843
00:50:43.491 --> 00:50:47.310
us in the neanderthals or around a ballpark. I mean, all these are ranges.

844
00:50:47.311 --> 00:50:50.450
So just goes to show how far apart they actually out. So, okay.

845
00:50:50.451 --> 00:50:54.230
So I thought that that's not, that doesn't work. Well,

846
00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:58.460
it kind of shouldn't work. But wildlife manager,

847
00:50:59.150 --> 00:51:01.250
Marcia Branigan says, oh, it sorta does.

848
00:51:01.310 --> 00:51:05.270
That's kind of against the biological terminology that we use for species.

849
00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:10.350
<v 17>Oh, they're breaking the rules, breaking the rules, the rules we made, right?</v>

850
00:51:10.351 --> 00:51:13.860
The number of polar and grizzly bear hybrids has been growing over the last few

851
00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:17.320
years. It's evolution in action. We're seeing it take place before our eyes.

852
00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:20.430
Bear might not be considered a rare creature for too long.

853
00:51:20.431 --> 00:51:24.180
And this sort of general idea about this whole new species is it is linked to

854
00:51:24.181 --> 00:51:28.500
the changing climate because now these two species are overlapping.

855
00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:32.040
Hotter temperatures are moving Alaska and Canada's grizzly bears north of all

856
00:51:32.041 --> 00:51:35.640
polar bears are losing much of their ice and spending more time on land.

857
00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:40.380
So for instance, the polar bears have hair covering the bottom of their feet.

858
00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:45.330
Grizzly bears do not. Um, but then heads, they have pads. Yeah. But then the,

859
00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:48.150
or bears has like partial hair covering.

860
00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:51.750
So like maybe you get the best of both worlds, you know, grip or whatever.

861
00:51:51.751 --> 00:51:54.480
But also you're, you're warm. Oh.

862
00:51:54.481 --> 00:51:58.290
So it's a good thing to be one of these half, right. Hybrid Vigor,

863
00:51:58.291 --> 00:52:01.220
best of both worlds kind of thing. This is the new bearings.

864
00:52:01.590 --> 00:52:02.423
<v 8>Oh yeah.</v>

865
00:52:03.150 --> 00:52:08.150
So this isn't it bells on knocked bizarre Frankenstein night creatures.

866
00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:12.420
They are valuable new hybrids there may become increasingly common.

867
00:52:17.290 --> 00:52:18.820
<v 17>So that's, that's kind of like an,</v>

868
00:52:18.850 --> 00:52:22.810
and that's the story we got interested in and that's the story that has been

869
00:52:22.811 --> 00:52:23.644
reported.

870
00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:28.420
But then last year this paper came out and it kind of completely changes the

871
00:52:28.421 --> 00:52:32.460
story. And are we at the place where you're, where the um,

872
00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:35.000
the bear's become breaking news? Yeah,

873
00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:40.330
I actually think it's even more interesting than that first story. It's way,

874
00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:44.320
way weirder. It could more dramatically play out like on an HBO miniseries.

875
00:52:45.250 --> 00:52:49.020
Okay. Lay It on me. So last year a paper came out and that scientists,

876
00:52:49.021 --> 00:52:49.854
we talked to you,

877
00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:54.060
Marcia Branigan is one of his coauthors and what they did is they basically made

878
00:52:54.061 --> 00:52:59.061
a big giant list of every citing of a hybrid bear and of all the genetic

879
00:52:59.851 --> 00:53:03.840
analysis of like every time we've seen this happen in the wild and all the

880
00:53:03.841 --> 00:53:05.970
information we could possibly glean from that.

881
00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:11.100
And what you found was that every single one of these hybrids can be traced back

882
00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:12.070
to

883
00:53:12.070 --> 00:53:14.110
<v 4>one female polar bear,</v>

884
00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:19.750
<v 17>one single bear named bear,</v>

885
00:53:19.751 --> 00:53:21.550
one zero nine six zero

886
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:28.410
will be a scientist with the of her that she is,

887
00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:32.580
she is literally the mother of all hybrid bears in the wild. Wow.

888
00:53:32.610 --> 00:53:35.970
So there's something about this polar bear that seemed to attract grizzly

889
00:53:36.570 --> 00:53:36.870
gentleman

890
00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:40.680
<v 21>or she was just interested in Grizzly gentlemen. Wow.</v>

891
00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:44.250
We mostly just have kind of guesses of how it went down since there were no

892
00:53:44.251 --> 00:53:44.810
witness.

893
00:53:44.810 --> 00:53:48.830
<v 17>This is Elisa McCall, she's a staff scientist at polar bears international.</v>

894
00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:52.550
<v 21>But what we think could have happened is that there was this female polar bear,</v>

895
00:53:52.551 --> 00:53:54.710
and maybe she did have some, you know,

896
00:53:54.711 --> 00:53:58.730
interesting personal preference for Brown bears or maybe it was simply that she

897
00:53:58.731 --> 00:54:03.680
was an estrus and a male. She was there, she was basically in heat.

898
00:54:03.681 --> 00:54:05.770
So she's giving off a sense that she wants to mate. Okay.

899
00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:09.380
They leave these stinky foot trails and so males will follow them on the ice.

900
00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:12.290
What are those smell like? Oh my gosh. You know, I've never smelled that,

901
00:54:12.770 --> 00:54:17.320
but I know to a male polar bear, they smelled good. That's all I know. Um,

902
00:54:17.330 --> 00:54:21.380
but as the female puts down the smelly footprints, the males are like, oh yeah.

903
00:54:21.381 --> 00:54:24.560
And they'll follow her for you know, days and it's cute.

904
00:54:24.561 --> 00:54:28.530
They'll actually put their feet right in the footprints. They follow her way.

905
00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:33.500
Yeah. So maybe there was just this really aggressive brown bear,

906
00:54:33.501 --> 00:54:38.501
grizzly bear male who followed the female tracks and could have fought off other

907
00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:41.030
polar bear males.

908
00:54:41.050 --> 00:54:44.800
<v 17>Maybe this is a case of, of like, like nonconsensual,</v>

909
00:54:44.830 --> 00:54:48.300
but if you look at sort of like the genetic analysis, it looks like

910
00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:50.490
<v 7>Maynard with two different grizzly bears.</v>

911
00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:55.050
<v 17>She had babies with two different grizzly bears and with one of them she had</v>

912
00:54:55.051 --> 00:54:59.810
babies years apart. Oh. So she's had three litters with, with, with,

913
00:54:59.811 --> 00:55:02.130
with two different grizzly bears. Interesting.

914
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:05.070
<v 7>And all the offspring are from those three non hybrid barriers.</v>

915
00:55:05.170 --> 00:55:08.830
<v 21>So this is narrowing in scope really quickly.</v>

916
00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:13.610
<v 17>Yeah. It's not like, oh this is this. Yeah. This like species wide,</v>

917
00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:16.100
you know, new adaptation. It's just like,

918
00:55:16.130 --> 00:55:18.890
here's this one lady who has this one kink,

919
00:55:20.310 --> 00:55:21.870
<v 7>strange place. And then I guess, but</v>

920
00:55:22.770 --> 00:55:23.581
<v 17>right. It also,</v>

921
00:55:23.581 --> 00:55:27.030
there is a possibility that it's like those were just the only dudes around.

922
00:55:27.130 --> 00:55:27.190
Yeah. But

923
00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:31.150
<v 21>I was thinking like, oh my God, maybe this bear is a genius.</v>

924
00:55:31.310 --> 00:55:34.360
And she's seeing this like ice change around her and she's saying like,

925
00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:36.670
I need to save my DNA.

926
00:55:36.671 --> 00:55:39.610
And the best way to do it is to put it with a grizzly cause they're doing better

927
00:55:39.611 --> 00:55:42.700
than I am. That's hilarious. I mean, yeah.

928
00:55:42.701 --> 00:55:46.480
Imagine that there's thought, hey, that would be pretty good.

929
00:55:46.630 --> 00:55:50.080
Unfortunately, the hybrids were kind of a mess, to be honest.

930
00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:52.750
They weren't really well suited for land or for ice.

931
00:55:52.751 --> 00:55:55.210
They were such an in between bear, um,

932
00:55:55.510 --> 00:55:58.010
that they really just weren't that fit.

933
00:55:58.060 --> 00:56:02.590
And really grizzly bears are so well adapted to life on land and finding food.

934
00:56:02.770 --> 00:56:04.570
You've got the big comp, they've got the big wide head.

935
00:56:04.571 --> 00:56:06.940
They've got these long claws for digging.

936
00:56:06.941 --> 00:56:10.070
They don't have for on the pads of their feet because they don't need it. Right.

937
00:56:10.090 --> 00:56:14.080
Polar bears are so well adapted for the ice. They've got a much smoother,

938
00:56:14.081 --> 00:56:17.500
sleeker head that helps them get in and out of seal holes. They've got thicker,

939
00:56:17.501 --> 00:56:20.470
sharper claws to grab seals and help them walk on the ice.

940
00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:25.920
There for is hollow a which helps trap warm air against their bodies in the

941
00:56:26.051 --> 00:56:29.830
hybrid. They're like this weird in between. So their head is kind of like,

942
00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:33.250
not really sleek, but not really boxy. Kind of this weird in between.

943
00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:35.980
They don't really blend in that well with the ice or with the land,

944
00:56:35.981 --> 00:56:39.430
cause they're kind of this creamy color. Right. And then there for itself,

945
00:56:39.790 --> 00:56:44.790
depending on where the is on the body is like a mix of hollow but not hollow

946
00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:50.160
like, so yeah, it backfired on her if that was her marathon.

947
00:56:51.010 --> 00:56:51.970
But I like that idea.

948
00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:57.040
<v 20>So these Peasley bears are just probably not the new horizon of the bear that</v>

949
00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:01.610
will be a, and actually on top of that.

950
00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:04.760
<v 17>So, so, okay. So if you're imagining the family tree, right?</v>

951
00:57:04.761 --> 00:57:06.450
So there's a mama polar bear, uh,

952
00:57:06.590 --> 00:57:09.860
with these two grizzly bears at different times. Right. Okay. So there's the,

953
00:57:09.890 --> 00:57:14.150
let's say the dad and the Stepdad, one of the kids, a daughter,

954
00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:16.880
and she's the only one who's had kids herself.

955
00:57:16.881 --> 00:57:18.620
So the third generation came from her,

956
00:57:18.770 --> 00:57:22.130
but it turns out that all those third generation bears, including the bear,

957
00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:25.980
the David Katana shot, um, that bear, the,

958
00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:28.580
the daughter bear he made with her father.

959
00:57:28.790 --> 00:57:32.150
<v 20>Wait, there's some sort of incest part to this.</v>

960
00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:33.813
<v 7>Okay. Yeah.</v>

961
00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:35.280
<v 20>Oh, that's so weird.</v>

962
00:57:37.260 --> 00:57:38.410
<v 7>[inaudible] with the other barrier that</v>

963
00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:42.620
<v 17>Kinda like dated the Stepdad sort of thing? Yeah. Sort of. Yeah.</v>

964
00:57:42.730 --> 00:57:46.510
<v 20>She slept with the same two dudes that are, mom did. Oh my gosh.</v>

965
00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:50.920
Now we're going from HBO to like Shakespeare. Yeah.

966
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:53.380
Or like Greek tragedy or something.

967
00:57:53.450 --> 00:57:55.300
<v 17>That's a weird family tree. It's healed.</v>

968
00:57:55.310 --> 00:57:59.240
Now all of a sudden it looks less like a species wide movement for life.

969
00:57:59.330 --> 00:58:02.600
We'll find a way and it looks a little more like this is one crazy interbred.

970
00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:06.330
<v 20>Wow. So what do you make of that?</v>

971
00:58:06.510 --> 00:58:10.890
Maybe this one like crazy inbred family is the first, you know,

972
00:58:10.891 --> 00:58:15.300
quite awkward attempt at what may become like, you know,

973
00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:20.360
might be like evolution striving forward and making shaky step after shaky

974
00:58:20.371 --> 00:58:21.730
steps. Nature is run

975
00:58:21.930 --> 00:58:25.780
<v 17>cheat. It's not like pretty the way you expected. It's Rhonchi because sex like,</v>

976
00:58:25.810 --> 00:58:30.640
like animals try things. It's like this could,

977
00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:34.450
maybe this is gonna keep going, but, but only time will tell.

978
00:58:34.451 --> 00:58:35.470
There's no way for us to know.

979
00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:50.770
<v 20>And one last thing, uh, which is kind of an afterthought, but, but maybe not.</v>

980
00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:55.120
Uh, because while it's not clear whether our polar bear family is,

981
00:58:55.300 --> 00:59:00.220
is an awkward evolutionary step forward or just just playing freaky,

982
00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:00.880
uh,

983
00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:05.880
what we do know is that nature is not exactly shy when it comes to being

984
00:59:06.641 --> 00:59:10.750
sexually creative. Is this seven path. Yes.

985
00:59:10.990 --> 00:59:12.970
So it turns out at the Museum of sex,

986
00:59:12.971 --> 00:59:15.340
they have this exhibit called the the sex lives of animals.

987
00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:17.240
And my brother was coming into [inaudible].

988
00:59:17.530 --> 00:59:21.630
<v 17>People aren't shy with the horns and we thought incest is themes.</v>

989
00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:23.150
<v 20>Send both of them.</v>

990
00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:25.910
I'm glad you went there because my mind went there and I was like, whoa.

991
00:59:26.690 --> 00:59:29.930
I sort of organized this before I learned about the incest thing,

992
00:59:29.931 --> 00:59:31.100
but it's just this or you know.

993
00:59:31.101 --> 00:59:35.330
But then it just made it all that more uncomfortable. But anyway. Okay,

994
00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:40.190
let's go. You also didn't know about any of this going in, so he poor guy. Yeah.

995
00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:44.460
Are we here? Really? But we,

996
00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:47.780
we got got into that room and a very nice woman named Stephanie Spicer showed us

997
00:59:47.781 --> 00:59:52.781
around and we learned just like nature is trying some crazy stuff.

998
00:59:53.330 --> 00:59:57.620
Give me a, give me like a, like a listicle. Have sex through there.

999
00:59:57.621 --> 01:00:02.360
Blow holes. Whoa. I guess why not? I'm tortoises have a crazy tongue.

1000
01:00:02.361 --> 01:00:04.800
Penis. Whoa. That comes out of nowhere.

1001
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.880
That's like somebody from alien ducks have sex with each other while they're

1002
01:00:07.881 --> 01:00:12.410
dead somehow. Oh dear. Have threesomes. Um,

1003
01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:16.210
there's all kinds of butts stuff. What is that? Is that, I don't know.

1004
01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:21.140
And actually at one point we were sort of surrounded by clitorises and other

1005
01:00:21.141 --> 01:00:21.410
things.

1006
01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:24.710
I am starting to feel like I've been in a row and I'm feeling a little queasy

1007
01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:28.970
and then we're like, they need like an obstinance room for brothers, sisters,

1008
01:00:28.971 --> 01:00:32.930
just like, we just need a minute. Can we have a minute?

1009
01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:34.790
Where's the celibate space?

1010
01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:38.540
And then we got free passes to the booby bouncy castle. And I was like,

1011
01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:42.760
Jimmy got into it. And so we do. And he's like, Oh God,

1012
01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:45.400
I've just sent pictures to my parents and they're just like

1013
01:00:48.070 --> 01:00:48.903
Canada

1014
01:00:54.270 --> 01:00:55.103
<v 8>left.</v>

1015
01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:05.470
<v 0>That's wonderful. That's how you end up bear show right there. Yes.</v>
