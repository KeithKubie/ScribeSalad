00:00:00.031 --> 00:00:01.088
- [Instructor] The graph of y

00:00:01.088 --> 00:00:03.003
is equal to absolute value of x

00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:04.812
is reflected across the x-axis

00:00:04.812 --> 00:00:07.726
and then scaled vertically
by a factor of seven.

00:00:07.726 --> 00:00:10.603
What is the equation of the new graph?

00:00:10.603 --> 00:00:13.068
So pause the video and see
if you can figure that out.

00:00:13.068 --> 00:00:15.254
Alright, let's work
through it together now.

00:00:15.254 --> 00:00:17.508
Now, you might not need
to draw it visually

00:00:17.508 --> 00:00:19.883
but I will just so that
we can all together

00:00:19.883 --> 00:00:22.378
visualize what is going on.

00:00:22.378 --> 00:00:24.879
So let's say that's my x-axis

00:00:24.879 --> 00:00:26.712
and that is my y-axis.

00:00:29.837 --> 00:00:32.253
y equals the absolute value of x.

00:00:32.253 --> 00:00:35.032
So for non-negative values of x,

00:00:35.032 --> 00:00:36.547
y is going to be equal to x.

00:00:36.547 --> 00:00:37.858
Absolute value of zero is zero.

00:00:37.858 --> 00:00:39.017
Absolute value of one is one.

00:00:39.017 --> 00:00:40.730
Absolute value of two is two.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.462
So it's gonna look like this.

00:00:42.462 --> 00:00:44.923
It's gonna have a slope of one

00:00:44.923 --> 00:00:46.328
and then for negative values,

00:00:46.328 --> 00:00:47.684
when you take the absolute value,

00:00:47.684 --> 00:00:48.583
you're gonna take the opposite.

00:00:48.583 --> 00:00:50.062
You're gonna get the positive.

00:00:50.062 --> 00:00:52.175
So it's gonna look like this.

00:00:52.175 --> 00:00:55.012
Let me see if I can draw
that a little bit cleaner.

00:00:55.012 --> 00:00:58.032
This is a hand drawn
sketch so bear with me

00:00:58.032 --> 00:00:59.078
but hopefully this is familiar.

00:00:59.078 --> 00:00:59.911
You've seen the graph

00:00:59.911 --> 00:01:04.296
of y is equal to absolute
value of x before.

00:01:04.296 --> 00:01:06.708
Now, let's think about the
different transformations.

00:01:06.708 --> 00:01:10.875
So first, they say is
reflected across the x-axis.

00:01:12.349 --> 00:01:13.599
So for example,

00:01:14.558 --> 00:01:18.315
if I have some x value right over here,

00:01:18.315 --> 00:01:20.242
before, I would take
the absolute value of x

00:01:20.242 --> 00:01:21.878
and I would end up there

00:01:21.878 --> 00:01:25.131
but now we wanna reflect across the x-axis

00:01:25.131 --> 00:01:28.748
so we wanna essentially get
the negative of that value

00:01:28.748 --> 00:01:32.192
associated with that corresponding x

00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:33.705
and so for example, this x,

00:01:33.705 --> 00:01:35.921
before, we would get
the absolute value of x

00:01:35.921 --> 00:01:37.969
but now we wanna flip across the x-axis

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:40.512
and we wanna get the negative of it.

00:01:40.512 --> 00:01:42.838
So in general, what we are doing

00:01:42.838 --> 00:01:47.005
is we are getting the negative
of the absolute value of x.

00:01:48.843 --> 00:01:51.743
In general, if you're
flipping over the x-axis,

00:01:51.743 --> 00:01:53.093
you're getting the negative.

00:01:53.093 --> 00:01:57.791
You're scaling the expression
or the function by a negative.

00:01:57.791 --> 00:02:00.240
So this is going to be y
is equal to the negative

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.200
of the absolute value of x.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.919
Once again, whatever absolute value of x

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:05.881
was giving you before for given x,

00:02:05.881 --> 00:02:08.062
we now wanna get the negative of it.

00:02:08.062 --> 00:02:11.334
We now wanna get the negative of it.

00:02:11.334 --> 00:02:16.212
So that's what reflecting
across the x-axis does for us

00:02:16.212 --> 00:02:20.379
but then they say scaled
vertically by a factor of seven

00:02:22.915 --> 00:02:26.028
and the way I view that is if
you're scaling it vertically

00:02:26.028 --> 00:02:27.417
by a factor of seven,

00:02:27.417 --> 00:02:30.167
whatever y value you got for given x,

00:02:30.167 --> 00:02:33.358
you now wanna get seven times the y value,

00:02:33.358 --> 00:02:35.275
seven times the y value

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.617
for a given x.

00:02:43.655 --> 00:02:45.781
And so if you think
about that algebraically,

00:02:45.781 --> 00:02:48.407
well, if I want seven times the y value,

00:02:48.407 --> 00:02:51.514
I'd have to multiply this thing by seven.

00:02:51.514 --> 00:02:55.516
So I would get y is
equal to negative seven

00:02:55.516 --> 00:02:58.292
times the absolute value of x

00:02:58.292 --> 00:02:59.984
and that's essentially
what they're asking,

00:02:59.984 --> 00:03:01.742
what is the equation of the new graph,

00:03:01.742 --> 00:03:03.175
and so that's what it would be.

00:03:03.175 --> 00:03:05.795
The negative flips us over the x-axis

00:03:05.795 --> 00:03:09.027
and then the seven scales
vertically by a factor of seven

00:03:09.027 --> 00:03:11.516
but just to understand
what this would look like,

00:03:11.516 --> 00:03:13.695
well, you multiply zero times seven,

00:03:13.695 --> 00:03:15.263
it doesn't change anything

00:03:15.263 --> 00:03:17.843
but whatever x this is,

00:03:17.843 --> 00:03:20.049
this was equal to negative x

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.079
but now we're gonna get
to negative seven x.

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.760
So let's see, two, three,
four, five, six, seven

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.972
so it'd put it something around that.

00:03:29.972 --> 00:03:32.545
So our graph is now going to look,

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:34.623
is now going to look like this.

00:03:34.623 --> 00:03:39.334
It's going to be stretched
along the vertical axis.

00:03:39.334 --> 00:03:41.701
If we were scaling vertically

00:03:41.701 --> 00:03:44.654
by something that had an
absolute value less than one

00:03:44.654 --> 00:03:46.697
then it would make the graph less tall.

00:03:46.697 --> 00:03:47.798
It would make it look,

00:03:47.798 --> 00:03:49.552
it would make it look wider.

00:03:49.552 --> 00:03:52.245
Let me make it at least look
a little bit more symmetric.

00:03:52.245 --> 00:03:54.670
So it's gonna look something,

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.047
something like that but the key issue

00:03:57.047 --> 00:03:58.876
and the reason why I'm
drawing is so you can see

00:03:58.876 --> 00:04:00.707
that it looks like it's
being scaled vertically.

00:04:00.707 --> 00:04:02.668
It's being stretched in
the vertical direction

00:04:02.668 --> 00:04:06.232
by a factor of seven and the
way we do that algebraically

00:04:06.232 --> 00:04:07.418
is we multiply by seven

00:04:07.418 --> 00:04:11.585
and the negative here is what
flipped us over the x-axis.
