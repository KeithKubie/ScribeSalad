bipedal, naked, large brain. Long the

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:37.140
master of fire, tools, and language, but
still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:48.620
Aware that death is inevitable, yet filled
with optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:56.130
down knowledge. We empathize and deceive.
We shape the future from our shared

understanding of the past.
CARTA brings together experts from diverse

- [James Cleaver] I'd like to thank very
much to the organizers of this conference

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:10.180
for inviting me. I just want to, as I
frequently speak to clinical audiences, I

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:23.000
have to make my declaration of disclaim. I
essentially work in borrowed space, use

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:31.780
borrowed money, and I'm living on borrowed
time. Hence, I like as my theme Thomas

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.720
Huxley's remark that, "Scientists over 60
do more harm than good."

00:02:38.121 --> 00:02:47.090
Now I want to direct you to a traveling
story. Skin is our major defense against

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.390
an onslaught of one of the strongest
carcinogens that we experience,

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:59.230
ultraviolet light. And some years ago I
was directed to this village in Northern

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.140
Guatemala were the missionary's orders
that the children had enormous amount of

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.350
skin cancer, and they were dying at 10
years of age.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:13.390
Now, commonly, you would think skin cancer
as an older person's problem. These are

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:20.230
dramatic examples of how, if we lose the
genetic defense against sun exposure,

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.780
cancer can be an enormously disastrous
problem at the skin level. So they

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.550
directed me to this village and it had the
phenotype of a disease that I'd work for

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.620
many years, xeroderma pigmentosum.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.560
That's normally a recessive disease. In
then U.. S population, it occurs about one

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.860
to four per million of the population.
Twenty-five percent of the children had

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.950
this disease. They lived under extreme
poverty. When we had a look at the

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.790
patients, you could see the enormous sun
damage of their face, and the painful

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:01.150
sunburns. When we brought cells back, you
can see here and exposed these cells to

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:07.440
ultraviolet in the lab where the normal
skin has excellent survival, their cells

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.790
were killed at very, very low doses of UV.
So they had a genetic predisposition in

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:21.560
which they could not handle sun exposure,
solar exposure. We sequenced, and we found

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:28.270
that they lacked what you call now the
global genome repair pathway. The founder

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:34.170
effect in this village was a mutation
which caused...which removed one cytosine

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:40.570
from a gene we call XPC which is one of
the main damage recognition proteins in

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:41.580
the skin.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:48.260
When we did...even a staining of a section
of the skin, the black staining here,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:54.100
indications of high expression of the XPC
protein in the epidermis of normal skin.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.760
From the Guatemalan village, there is no
expression of this gene. As a result,

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.870
their cells fail to recognize DNA damage
and it goes on to develop into cancer.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:12.610
I will show you some of the ramifications
of this. Now, xeroderma pigmentosum, XP,

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:18.510
is one of a family of some sensitive
diseases involving different components of

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:25.270
the nucleotide excision repair pathway. As
an aside, I'd just like to mention that

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:31.290
you may have seen that the Nobel prize for
chemistry this year was given to Tom

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:44.923
Lindahl, Z. Sancar, and the mismatch
repair pathway for unraveling the

00:05:44.923 --> 00:05:47.584
biochemistry of this pathway.

00:05:47.584 --> 00:05:55.018
Now, xeroderma pigmentosum is unique from
among the repair systems for solar UV in

00:05:55.018 --> 00:06:02.420
that they have very high cancer. These
other diseases are also components of the

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:07.730
same repair pathway, but they essentially
are photosensitive but without skin

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.290
cancer.
And especially a disease here known as the

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:18.940
UVS syndrome has acute sunburn, but no
neurological disorders, none of the

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:25.210
developmental disorders or the current
Cockayne syndrome, and a very mild

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:31.240
version. So there's an extremely wide
variation in the genetic response to sun

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.200
exposure.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:37.940
Now the main photoproducts caused by UV
occur between two adjacent pyrimidines in

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:43.910
the DNA. The major photoproduct is the
dimer in which two covalent bonds are

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:51.180
formed. An alternative photoproduct, the
6-4 photoproduct. Now if you do not remove

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:56.980
these photoproducts, either of these, if
you don't remove them bio-chemically from

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:03.097
the DNA, they can go on to interfere with
DNA replication. And a cytosine and a TC

00:07:03.097 --> 00:07:09.390
photoproduct can deaminate, code as an A,
you know, codes as a T and then opposite

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:16.520
an A is placed. After two cycles of
replication, a TC sequence becomes a TT.

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:23.510
So, a C to a T transition mutation in a TC
sequence is an absolute fingerprint for UV

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:30.040
exposure and a UV-induced mutation. Now,
the excision repair pathway for UV damage

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:38.650
has two major routes. If the DNA is
unexpressed, which is a large majority of

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:45.030
our DNA, damage is recognized by a
dedicated damage recognition protein of

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:51.180
which XPC, the Guatemalan population, has
a mutation. So they failed to recognize.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:57.160
An alternative mechanism by which damage
is recognize is an arrested transcription.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:03.000
If cells cannot recover from this, they
have the disease called Cockayne syndrome.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.700
And then, these two pathways converge on
an extensive remodeling system to repair

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:12.410
the DNA. If we look more closely at the
transcription process, there are two

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:16.770
strands, the coding strands and a template
strand. The template strand is the one

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:23.890
which is transcribed into RNA. The repair
of these two strands is different. The XPC

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:29.050
system repairs this strand. The
transcribed strand is repaired by a

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:32.960
complex of proteins that are associated
with a transcription complex. The

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:38.080
difference between these two strands have
a major impact on carcinogenesis.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:43.350
First, if you look at repair in terms of
the removal of a number of photoproducts,

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:51.590
with time, in a highly expressed gene like
P53 or Dhfr, the photoproducts were remove

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:56.870
rapidly. In unexpressed or lower expressed
genes, the photoproducts were removed to a

00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:02.400
much lower extent. So the rate of repair
depends upon which strand the damage lies.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:08.000
We then collaborated recently with a group
in Seattle, Laura Loeb and Kev Bayliss, in

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.480
which they use a high throughput
sequencing method to determine exactly

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.540
what are the sequence changes in a
UV-rated population.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:18.930
Now, those of you...those of us who have
worked in a million [sp] cell biology and

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:24.050
tissue culture immunogenesis realize that
over the years, we've only had one or two

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:29.000
genes that are capable of studying
mutagenesis in culture because of the

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.900
number...the rarity of having a
drug-selectable locus. With high

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:38.570
throughput sequencing, we can get by that
completely. And so, here is the result of

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:43.600
measuring the mutation frequency in
nucleotide changes per 10 to the 7th

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:48.440
nucleotides. High resolution sequencing
averaged over a large number of genes that

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:54.420
are relevant for skin cancer. And you can
see that a wild-type normal cell has a low

00:09:54.420 --> 00:10:02.080
increase in mutations or function of dose,
but in a XPC such as we see in Guatemala

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.580
village, enormous increase in mutation
rates.

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:11.520
Going up from 0.5 up to 5. A tenfold or
more increase in mutation rates.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:17.690
We then decided once we had that system
working, we went back to Guatemala and

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:22.320
with some help of a clinical service team
that goes there from San Diego regularly

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:27.730
to treat the patients and give them some
clinical help, we brought back five

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:33.370
squamous carcinomas from this population.
Sequenced three million single nucleotide

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:38.950
mutations by exome sequencing. Transition
mutations were a majority in XPC.

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:44.050
Now since it was a small population size,
we didn't concentrate on which genes were

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:49.480
mutated, but we asked, "What is the
frequency of mutations per kilobase across

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:54.510
the whole genome?” and asked, “What's the
mutation density?" When we do that...this

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:59.850
is a very interesting situation to
illustrate how the genome structure and

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:04.720
function have a major impact on mutation
rates.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:09.160
In a normal population...see in here,
normal squamous carcinomas from a normal

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:15.380
population. There is a protein in the
histone that methylates a region and

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:22.790
suppresses access for other enzymes. As a
result, the mutation density goes up

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:29.710
because those regions of the chromatin are
inaccessible to repair. As transcription

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:36.590
increases across the genome, we find that
this is...removes the repression, and as a

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:41.630
result mutation frequency declines. But
still, if you compare the non-transcribed

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:46.240
strand to the transcribed strand in the
tumor, there are more mutations in the

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:51.970
non-transcribed strand. When we move to
the XPC tumors from the Guatemalan

00:11:51.970 --> 00:12:00.110
patients, we find no removal on mutagenic
lesions right across the genome

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:05.270
irrespective of transcription level, but
in the transcribed strand, very efficient

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:08.290
removal.
Now these are striking illustration of the

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:14.950
fact that it depends critically which
strand of the DNA is damaged, which one

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:21.500
gets repaired. If the cells fail to repair
the non-transcribed strand, mutation rate

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:25.770
is very high when replication comes along
there. On the other strand, the

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:31.360
transcribed strand, it doesn't matter how
well that's repaired in the Guatemalan

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:36.900
population. Because they can't repair the
other strand, cancer is high. So that the

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:42.390
repair of these transcribed strand could
be very efficient, but if confers

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:47.990
absolutely no protection against
UV-induced mutations and carcinogenesis.

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:54.820
Now, if we can turn to another response of
the skin to ultraviolet exposure, sunburn.

00:12:54.820 --> 00:13:02.530
We often think and it's established more
or less that the risk for melanoma from

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:08.130
the sun is related to how many sunburns
you get. Well in squamous carcinoma

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:13.210
there's a very different situation. This
is the spectrum of xeroderma pigmentosum

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:17.220
patients from sun exposure, you can have a
patient with very high erythema and

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:22.330
sunburn. You can have patients with
freckling. Patients that develop severe

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:28.370
skin cancer. So you're going to have this
range, and this is under genetic control.

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:32.770
If you look, and this is data published
recently from England where they

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:37.870
have...bring in all the XPC patients from
the country, and treat them and follow

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:43.120
them in one single location. And this was
reported a couple of years ago. If you

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:52.170
look at sunburn versus which gene in the
XP repair pathway is mutated. If you look

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:59.420
at the patients with mutations in XPC,
XPE, or XPV which are genes that code for

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:05.820
proteins involved in the processing of DNA
damage in the non-expressed regions of the

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:11.590
genome.
They get cancer but they get no sunburn.

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:18.410
However, if the genes are involved in
repair and in transcription, sunburn is

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:24.320
very high. If you now look at the
probability of cancer, and then look at

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:31.130
patients that are involved...in which the
genes involved in transcription, cancer

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:40.260
appears slowly over time. And the 50%
onset is out...almost out as late as the

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:46.410
normal population. If we look at XPC and E
patients which are involved in the repair

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:51.810
of the non-transcribed regions and they
don't get sunburn, the cancers are

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:59.020
appearing more rapidly. Their 50% onset is
about the age of 20. So an acute sunburn

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:05.420
in this disease is actually delays
squamous carcinoma. It's the converse of

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:11.690
what you get with melanoma. As an aside,
it's interesting for me to note that the

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:18.920
50% onset here is in the early 20s. In
American xeroderma patients, it occurs

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:24.910
below the age of 10 which is reminiscent
for my childhood that England is a pretty

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:29.600
cloudy, damp, rainy place.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:35.920
So let me just summarize. Xeroderma
pigmentosum and related nucleotide repair

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:41.850
diseases highlight mechanisms of sunburn
and cancer. Repair is more rapid in more

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:47.650
highly expressed genes. Presumably because
an expressed gene has to open up the

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:54.250
chromatin to allow transcription to work
whereupon repair can work. Now deficient

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:58.260
repair of solar UV products in the
non-transcribed strands, and in

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:04.011
unexpressed DNA results in a high mutation
rate and cancer, but deficient repair in

00:16:04.011 --> 00:16:06.795
the transcribed strand results in
increased sunburn.

00:16:06.795 --> 00:16:12.624
Cancer is delayed or not increased. And in
fact, in Cockayne Syndrome which is

00:16:12.624 --> 00:16:18.026
uniquely involved in the repair of the
transcribed strands, those patients with

00:16:18.026 --> 00:16:22.100
Cockayne Syndrome have severe
developmental disorders, but as far as we

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:24.497
know they never get cancer.

00:16:24.497 --> 00:16:32.238
So, my question that I leave you with is,
"Can we increase repair in otherwise

00:16:32.238 --> 00:16:36.059
healthy persons to protect against skin
cancer including melanoma and other

00:16:36.059 --> 00:16:42.119
cancers?" And alternatively, since the
nucleotide excision repair pathway repairs

00:16:42.119 --> 00:16:47.663
UV-type damage which is large
modifications of DNA very similar to what

00:16:47.663 --> 00:16:53.068
occurs when you use chemotherapy like
cisplatins. Since it's the same repair

00:16:53.068 --> 00:16:59.955
pathway, "Can we inhibit repair, and then
sensitize cancers to chemotherapy with

00:16:59.955 --> 00:17:04.730
very few side effects?" So I leave you
with that. Thank you.
