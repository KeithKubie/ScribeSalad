00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:05.080
You are listening to Tu Tu Tu Tu Tu

2
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.660
for radio lab. This is radio lab. I'm Jad Abumrad.

3
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.530
We're going to start today's program with a brief diversion to midtown Manhattan

4
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.540
at the office of a neuropsychologist.

5
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.690
Cameron Fallon bore a well dressed man with a calm voice,

6
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.430
calming presence and uncanny ability to comm others, which is why we're here.

7
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.780
Are you going to be the volunteer? Uh, yeah. I should actually check it. Yeah.

8
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.050
He walks me over to a small machine and asks for my left hand.

9
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.400
Have you ever left? Okay.

10
00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:42.900
What we're doing right now,

11
00:00:42.901 --> 00:00:47.901
we're just putting a couple of sensors that measure basically the flow of

12
00:00:48.151 --> 00:00:53.070
electrons between two fingers here. That would be my index and middle fingers.

13
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.650
There are electrons going between my fingers. Oh absolutely.

14
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.520
There are salts and minerals that are going to enable a very tiny electrical

15
00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:04.680
charge to travel from one finger to the other one.

16
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.570
And he explained to the more anxious I am,

17
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.250
the more sparks fly between my fingers. In other words, this is a stress test.

18
00:01:11.251 --> 00:01:14.010
Okay, so I'm going to start at Miami or something.

19
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.590
You're not going to find anything,

20
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.550
but I will hear something that wine in the background. So if this goes up,

21
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.860
it means that you are more stressed.

22
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.690
So let me just make a couple of sounds here. You see,

23
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.760
stress me out man. Okay. Did you see that? Yeah.

24
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.970
Only with a couple of snaps near your ear. I got all the way to the top.

25
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.590
Yes, that's not good.

26
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.580
Well that means that you need to relax and break it down.

27
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.190
Techniques to bring stress down.

28
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.800
That is what Cameron Fallon poorer has promised us.

29
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.180
His theory is if you can hear your stress, you can control it. Okay,

30
00:01:51.181 --> 00:01:53.910
so what I'd like you to do is just to sit back

31
00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.350
and when you're ready, just go ahead and close your eyes.

32
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.430
And for now I'm going to actually get rid of the tone here for you.

33
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.860
You can monitor from here and I want you to just get as comfortable as you can

34
00:02:11.531 --> 00:02:12.364
get right now

35
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.190
and gradually starting to take the slow breaths.

36
00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.013
Will you ask them then?

37
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.500
Slow slowly

38
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.480
perhaps make your installation yes.

39
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.250
And more sustain.

40
00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.070
Perhaps you can notice as you continue to breed slowly

41
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.130
<v 1>that perhaps with each breath you feel a little bit more relaxed.</v>

42
00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:09.650
That bit more constant

43
00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.670
[inaudible] for now there is nothing.

44
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.440
<v 2>The phone rings now I'm all the way. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

45
00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.920
Isn't that appropriate? While you're trying to distress,

46
00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.000
make your life a little better,

47
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.200
the phone rings runes it all one fell swoop like life. Really.

48
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.090
At any moment a dirty bomb could go off. You know this, you could get downsized,

49
00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.170
dumped, dented by a med stroller pusher as you cross the street,

50
00:03:45.171 --> 00:03:49.280
a street already swimming with naked hostility and fist sized avian flu bucks.

51
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.760
The point is the phone could ring at any time

52
00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.600
<v 3>getting more stressed. It's like</v>

53
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.070
<v 0>we can't control stress, but what we can do is understand it. Now,</v>

54
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.190
if we lower the, uh,

55
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.890
<v 2>lights today on radio lab conversations and stories about stress from many</v>

56
00:04:14.891 --> 00:04:18.940
different perspectives, starting with the science, when you are stressed out,

57
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.130
these things inside your digestion,

58
00:04:21.131 --> 00:04:25.600
reproduction row with your heart rate change drastically and a leading

59
00:04:25.601 --> 00:04:28.780
researcher will explain exactly how and later in the program,

60
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.140
very famous and perplexing case of stage fright.

61
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.350
It feels like somebody's you know, strangling you from the inside.

62
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.910
I'm Jad Abumrad riding shotgun with me is Mr Robert Krulwich. Oh,

63
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:40.900
who by the way,

64
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.830
immediately say that I think we should correct the prejudice here.

65
00:04:44.831 --> 00:04:48.520
You seem to be anxious about stress. Well,

66
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.190
maybe a little bit stress is your friend.

67
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.290
We need it in midterms in eighth grade. If you didn't have a stress,

68
00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.970
you wouldn't have gotten to ninth grade. You shouldn't just say, Oh God,

69
00:05:00.971 --> 00:05:05.350
let's have less of it. Sometimes you want it to kick you in the button.

70
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.790
<v 0>All right. I think our first story gets it. What you're saying.</v>

71
00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.640
It comes from a guy named Colby Hall. Colby,

72
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.950
tell me what you had for breakfast so I can set the levels. All right.

73
00:05:13.951 --> 00:05:18.630
This morning I had a two hard boiled eggs and that Colby hall at a party

74
00:05:18.631 --> 00:05:21.330
actually overheard him telling the story you're about to hear.

75
00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.410
It's amazing story. So asked him to come in and tell to us in the studio. Now,

76
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:26.760
if you are squeamish,

77
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.080
you may want to consider turning the radio down for about seven minutes.

78
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.450
Does that sound sounds good to me and in your headphones. Good. All right, cool.

79
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.130
All right, Colby, let me start by asking you,

80
00:05:35.131 --> 00:05:39.690
at what point in the story did you realize you were in big trouble that your

81
00:05:39.691 --> 00:05:43.560
life was changing? When someone said get a tourniquet

82
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.500
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

83
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.440
<v 0>4th of July weekend up in Vermont, doubles tennis,</v>

84
00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.040
foothills of the green mountains, barbecues, beer lake.

85
00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.900
It was perfect in every single,

86
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.370
<v 5>and uh, we just said, let's, let's go water skiing.</v>

87
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.650
So we load up the boat with towels and uh, you know,

88
00:06:06.651 --> 00:06:08.600
we all get on there sort of excited to, you know,

89
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.110
kill an hour and a half on a beautiful lake on just a gorgeous, gorgeous day.

90
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.240
And just as we're sort of loading up the boat,

91
00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:18.080
a canoe comes up to the dock and the in the canoe is this family,

92
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.510
this mother and father and their two little children and they were staying in a

93
00:06:20.511 --> 00:06:22.730
house. And so we said, well, do you guys want to join us? Sure.

94
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.790
So the two little kids get in the boat and the father gets in the boat and we,

95
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
we pulled out from the dock and we get about 30 yards away from the dock and the

96
00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:32.240
boat driver stops.

97
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.500
I have my little Waterski such devices belt on and it's kind of old school type.

98
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.333
And uh,

99
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.120
I jump off the side of the boat and the force of me getting in the water that

100
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.010
the Waterski belt falls off of me. No big deal. I'm just going to swim over.

101
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:49.700
And uh, I look up and the boat is closer to me than I had thought.

102
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:52.190
And it was actually moving towards me.

103
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:55.940
I guess with the driver had done is he may have thought he would put it in

104
00:06:55.941 --> 00:06:56.271
neutral,

105
00:06:56.271 --> 00:06:59.030
but in fact you put it in very slight reverse and he didn't know that I was

106
00:06:59.031 --> 00:07:01.640
behind it. He was dealing with the, uh, the rope.

107
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:07.090
And so I'm in the water buckling the water belt and I look up and I notice,

108
00:07:07.221 --> 00:07:11.690
and it's about 10 feet away from me. So I yell, Hey,

109
00:07:11.691 --> 00:07:15.670
stop the boat. But it's a big boat. And you know, the wind is blowing and uh,

110
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.410
you know, your head is like sort of w level of the waters.

111
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.340
No one really heard me.

112
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.320
I couldn't move out of the way and it literally just came right up to me.

113
00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:28.830
So I put my hands out to protect myself and uh,

114
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:33.890
immediately like I feel like these punches on my legs,

115
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:37.750
which was the boat propeller.

116
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:40.850
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

117
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:42.740
<v 5>people say living in the moment like you</v>

118
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:44.860
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

119
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:49.390
<v 5>it's amazing to me how many complex thoughts you have in a split second.</v>

120
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.710
Wait, is this happening? Oh my God, it's happening. Wow.

121
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:58.360
This is cutting my legs. I'm trapped. I need to get out of this situation.

122
00:07:58.361 --> 00:08:02.110
I'm going to push up, I'm going to go under the boat and let it go over me.

123
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.030
Like that all happened in a split second.

124
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.490
And at the same time you're thinking like,

125
00:08:06.491 --> 00:08:11.491
maybe this will just be a bad injury or maybe I'll lose the use of one leg.

126
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.430
Here's all these sort of weird deals that you make in your head. Like,

127
00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.620
I don't want to die so I'll just, you know,

128
00:08:17.621 --> 00:08:19.420
be in a wheelchair or maybe I'll just be really,

129
00:08:19.421 --> 00:08:21.850
really injured or maybe I'll never be at play basketball again.

130
00:08:21.851 --> 00:08:24.660
Maybe I'll just always walk with a limp. You know, the other side of this,

131
00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:28.840
this all happened one month to the day of my wedding.

132
00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.860
He had planned this really,

133
00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:36.460
I mean it was small but beautiful wedding upstate and uh, you know,

134
00:08:36.461 --> 00:08:38.980
I want it to walk down the aisle. I want it to have the first answer.

135
00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:44.320
And it sounds odd to explain that you're having all those thoughts and that time

136
00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:45.243
that you are.

137
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:51.500
So I come up on the other side of the boat and a sort of gassed fare and I say

138
00:08:51.501 --> 00:08:51.900
I'm hurt.

139
00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.150
<v 6>Okay.</v>

140
00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:57.300
<v 5>It doesn't really hurt like you would, that was the weird thing.</v>

141
00:08:57.301 --> 00:08:59.910
Like it didn't hurt it just a,

142
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:04.800
I mean I feel it treading water and my legs are kind of numb.

143
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:08.850
I look up and my fiance is on the boat and she gets up and she sees me and she

144
00:09:08.851 --> 00:09:12.900
can see that ring of blood surrounding me and the water up there is so clear

145
00:09:12.901 --> 00:09:14.310
that she could see through the water.

146
00:09:14.311 --> 00:09:19.311
She could see deep red tissue on my legs and big flaps of skin sort of hanging

147
00:09:20.581 --> 00:09:23.400
off my legs floating with the motion of the water.

148
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:28.740
And it was at that point that cheat, you know the look on her face.

149
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:34.200
And it's funny like sometimes you don't recognize like how bad something is

150
00:09:34.201 --> 00:09:35.790
until you see it in the eyes of someone next to you.

151
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.620
And so when she freaked out and had the look of absolute terror in her eyes,

152
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:45.540
I kind of just took over the situation because I was 10 seconds ahead of

153
00:09:45.541 --> 00:09:48.960
everyone else. So I yelled to the wife of the boat operator,

154
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:53.130
whose name is Maria. And I said in a very stern, serious, calm voice,

155
00:09:53.131 --> 00:09:55.860
like marine turn off the boat.

156
00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:00.450
She turned the boat off and I realized that there were two little kids on the

157
00:10:00.451 --> 00:10:02.730
boat. And then the first thought that came to my mind was,

158
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:08.490
this is something that those kids shouldn't see. Before I came up,

159
00:10:08.491 --> 00:10:11.940
I said, marine, these kids should not see this. You should hide their eyes.

160
00:10:11.941 --> 00:10:15.600
You should distract them. So she took the kids to the front of the boat and uh,

161
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.270
I'm not a real strong person.

162
00:10:18.271 --> 00:10:20.550
I don't know how I got like sudden upper body strength,

163
00:10:20.551 --> 00:10:22.350
but I was able to just pull my full body weight.

164
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:26.000
I'm thinking I weigh like 210 15 pounds and I just pulled myself up into the

165
00:10:26.001 --> 00:10:29.550
back of the boat and there were my legs.

166
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:34.720
Layers of fat. I see muscle tissue I'm in.

167
00:10:34.721 --> 00:10:37.730
It's hard to sort of describe like my legs were wide open.

168
00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:41.810
There were big hunks of flesh that have hanging off my leg and the muscles just

169
00:10:41.811 --> 00:10:45.590
sort of, they're exposed to the air. The cuts went down to my bone.

170
00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:48.290
It's like you're at a fish market and you see someone cut into a fish.

171
00:10:48.291 --> 00:10:50.450
You just see the insides like very, very clearly.

172
00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:52.940
And that's when John says like,

173
00:10:52.941 --> 00:10:57.020
get a tourniquet because th the injuries on my legs really looked like it

174
00:10:57.021 --> 00:11:01.650
warranted a tourniquet. And uh, you know,

175
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:05.300
if I were to ask you to make a tourniquet right now, what would you do?

176
00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:08.120
Like I have no idea who knows how to make a tourniquet right there,

177
00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:09.710
good boy scouts on the boat. So, um,

178
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:12.090
somebody taking their shirt off and wrapped it around my leg and I said,

179
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:16.430
look at those towels. And so they wrapped the tiles around my leg and I'm,

180
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:21.380
what's happening between you and your fiance at that point? Um,

181
00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:23.120
my fiance

182
00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:29.210
thought that I was about to die and she was, you know,

183
00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:31.610
doing all that she could to kind of keep it together.

184
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:35.600
And I remember looking to her and rubbing her arm and saying,

185
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:40.670
this is going to be okay. Now is the time for us to be really brave.

186
00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:44.170
This will be okay if for nothing else.

187
00:11:44.171 --> 00:11:46.750
I just wanted to pretend that that was the case cause I didn't really know.

188
00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:51.873
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

189
00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:59.530
<v 5>my name is Colby hall and I survived a fight with a boat propeller,</v>

190
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:03.820
so he survived.

191
00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:08.500
Turns out the cuts he got was so clean and so deep that it allowed him to heal

192
00:12:08.501 --> 00:12:10.960
more quickly and as an aside,

193
00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:14.110
driving up to Vermont that weekend,

194
00:12:14.111 --> 00:12:17.530
we had stopped at the florist and had this big debate. My wife and I were mind,

195
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:21.010
she was my fiance at the time, about the color of tablecloths.

196
00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:23.560
You would have thought on the drive up that the single biggest issue in our

197
00:12:23.561 --> 00:12:25.300
lives was the color of tablecloths at the wedding.

198
00:12:25.301 --> 00:12:29.200
It was that the drive back from Vermont after this accident,

199
00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.950
you know, we felt so lucky.

200
00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:38.570
<v 8>Coby hall is a video producer for MTV and this is radio lab.</v>

201
00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.620
Today's topic is stress.

202
00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:49.120
What a story it happens that inside that story you've got a classic example of

203
00:12:50.091 --> 00:12:53.180
what always happens in a traumatic situation.

204
00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:56.780
I learned this from one of the leading experts on stretch. Robert Sapolsky.

205
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:59.300
Do you want me to incorporate your questions,

206
00:12:59.301 --> 00:13:02.540
my answer or just this Roman regular conversation so you can do whatever you

207
00:13:02.541 --> 00:13:03.260
want. Who,

208
00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:08.030
who teaches at Stanford University who pointed out to me that in these

209
00:13:08.031 --> 00:13:08.870
situations,

210
00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:13.430
your body is taken over really by stress hormones.

211
00:13:13.431 --> 00:13:17.030
That's that sort of alert tunnel, vision, time,

212
00:13:17.031 --> 00:13:18.620
passage fields different.

213
00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:22.790
The the eight seconds feel like it took for hours afterward.

214
00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:23.630
Is that what that's about?

215
00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:26.800
It's the stress hormones and that's mostly adrenaline. Doing that you're,

216
00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:27.643
you know,

217
00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:32.730
flailing in the water and hit by an propeller from the boat and your leg is to

218
00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:36.670
severed my imagination. There's two

219
00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:38.610
<v 9>people in the Dakota, oh my God. Oh my God.</v>

220
00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:42.830
<v 8>But you say, all right, let's call the police that you somehow are the calm one.</v>

221
00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.030
Is that part of this thing?

222
00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:47.030
Often that's the case and that's another piece of the stress response.

223
00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.080
You shut down payment

224
00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:50.330
<v 9>perception. It doesn't really hurt.</v>

225
00:13:50.331 --> 00:13:54.410
Like you would think that was the weird thing. Like it didn't hurt.

226
00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:57.190
<v 8>Pain is a very subjective state and if it's the right setting,</v>

227
00:13:57.191 --> 00:14:01.720
you blunt a and it's not just guys and battle who've been grievously injured and

228
00:14:01.721 --> 00:14:04.930
they think the blood has been spattered on them from the Gyne and the stump is

229
00:14:04.931 --> 00:14:07.240
just kind of tingling and then they suddenly discover it.

230
00:14:07.241 --> 00:14:10.180
But that's exactly what you do with pain perception.

231
00:14:10.181 --> 00:14:14.290
When you twist your ankle in the company softball game and you hardly even

232
00:14:14.291 --> 00:14:17.650
notice it. So in the face of a major physical stressor,

233
00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:22.180
not only is there this tunnel clarity and sensory, whatever,

234
00:14:22.181 --> 00:14:25.510
there's also blocking of pain. This in the moment,

235
00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:29.080
newness and you know, we all experienced at some point or other.

236
00:14:29.081 --> 00:14:33.310
Where were you when you heard that? When, if Paltrow would named her child,

237
00:14:33.311 --> 00:14:34.510
apple, that sort of thing.

238
00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:39.720
You know those moments that just define our lives and there's a physiology of

239
00:14:40.001 --> 00:14:44.110
it. I know exactly where I was. Where were you?

240
00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:49.240
Um, does he have any idea where that physiology came from? I think he does.

241
00:14:49.241 --> 00:14:49.481
Yeah.

242
00:14:49.481 --> 00:14:54.481
He thinks all mammals have these things in us that we'd gotten from evolution.

243
00:14:54.711 --> 00:14:58.550
So imagine say, Oh, you're a, an impala.

244
00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:03.650
What's an impala? So Antelope Kinda, yeah. So you're,

245
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:06.110
you're bounding across the sedan. It

246
00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:11.990
[inaudible]. You don't want this tiger to get anywhere near you.

247
00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:15.830
So your insights have to work hard to keep your outsides alive.

248
00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:19.520
You're running for your life, the predators coming after you.

249
00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:23.270
Certain stuff happens. First thing. You need energy,

250
00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:26.900
not energy tucked away in your fat cells for some building project.

251
00:15:26.901 --> 00:15:30.830
Next spring energy right now to go to whichever muscles are going to save your

252
00:15:30.831 --> 00:15:34.640
life, your adrenaline, other hormones. Go to your fat cells.

253
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:37.840
Pour out all this stored energy, feed it to your thymus.

254
00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:41.773
In addition,

255
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:45.650
you want to deliver this stuff as fast as possible so you increase your heart

256
00:15:45.651 --> 00:15:46.484
rate.

257
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:55.580
Another thing you do is you shut down everything.

258
00:15:55.581 --> 00:16:00.170
That's not essential right now. This is no time to worry about hobby collating.

259
00:16:00.171 --> 00:16:02.060
This is no time to worry about growing antlers.

260
00:16:02.061 --> 00:16:05.420
This is no time to digest breakfast. You shut down digestion.

261
00:16:05.421 --> 00:16:09.830
You shut down growth, you shut down reproduction. We all know, for example,

262
00:16:09.831 --> 00:16:12.380
if the digestive and the first step of that and you get nervous,

263
00:16:12.381 --> 00:16:17.300
your mouth gets dry. Everyone has this experience. You go to a,

264
00:16:17.301 --> 00:16:19.580
you have to make a presentation in front of a large number of people.

265
00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.450
Maybe just standing there and you're going, there's a burger.

266
00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.280
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,

267
00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:31.790
you know that just you can't, if you say the word dog,

268
00:16:31.791 --> 00:16:34.640
your tongue would get stuck at the top of your mouth cause you got nothing going

269
00:16:34.641 --> 00:16:39.140
on wet in your mouth. Your digestive system is shutting down.

270
00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.620
And the first step is those fluids that would help you digest upstream beam

271
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:47.590
aren't there anymore. This is like the antelope. In addition you,

272
00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:51.040
before you do your bowels, you void your bladder as well.

273
00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:54.420
Get rid of the dead weight. That's why people are executed in diapers.

274
00:16:54.421 --> 00:16:56.910
Typically you shut down all these unessentials.

275
00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:00.240
So if you add up all this stuff, if you say, okay,

276
00:17:00.241 --> 00:17:05.241
I'm not growing and I'm thinking faster and my heart is pacing so I can get all

277
00:17:05.521 --> 00:17:07.500
this stuff and I'm, all these things are going on simultaneously.

278
00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:12.090
This is not a bad thing at all. This is a great thing.

279
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:14.430
It's a great thing if you're stressed like a normal mammal.

280
00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:19.520
So when people talk about stress or stress diseases or being overstressed or the

281
00:17:20.851 --> 00:17:24.840
stressfulness of modern life, what does that mean?

282
00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:29.520
Well almost certainly it means it's got absolutely nothing to do with it.

283
00:17:29.521 --> 00:17:31.560
And with the impala running for its life.

284
00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:38.170
Very few parking spot fights are settled with axes. We don't have to, you know,

285
00:17:38.171 --> 00:17:42.930
wrestle people for canned food items and bombed out supermarkets, our boss. No,

286
00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:46.460
you haven't been to certain sections of New York lately. I know. Rah.

287
00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.720
I love people anyway.

288
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.280
When you're actually getting stressed in the way that we talk about in everyday

289
00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:55.020
sense, we're not being physically menaced.

290
00:17:55.021 --> 00:17:59.070
What we're doing is turning on the stress response in anticipation of a

291
00:17:59.071 --> 00:18:03.090
stressor. You mean this literally like you're sitting there in the bed thinking,

292
00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:04.770
Oh God, Oh God, Oh God,

293
00:18:04.771 --> 00:18:08.340
I had this sales meeting tomorrow and you're flushing to your body the same

294
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.220
stress hormones and everything else that will be flooding into the impala.

295
00:18:11.221 --> 00:18:15.330
Dashing being chased by a lion or you mean sorta like that? Yeah, actually,

296
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:19.320
you know, here's one of these, try it at home exercises, line bed.

297
00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:23.880
When you're nice and sleepy and relaxed and your heart's beating nice and slow,

298
00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:28.260
very carefully. Think you know that heart isn't going to beat forever

299
00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:34.260
and most likely you're going to turn on the exact same stress responses.

300
00:18:34.261 --> 00:18:37.980
If you were running for your life, same hormone, same physiological changes,

301
00:18:37.981 --> 00:18:41.370
same, all of that. Just that, oh my God, one day I'm going to die.

302
00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:43.590
If it really has the right impact on you.

303
00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:48.440
And the punchline of the entire field is that's not what the system evolved for.

304
00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:53.090
<v 10>[inaudible].</v>

305
00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:57.440
<v 8>So if you're a human being and you're nervous one and you forget,</v>

306
00:18:57.441 --> 00:19:00.560
scared in the nights in your body,

307
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:05.300
what's going on that will eventually make you sick. Exactly the same thing.

308
00:19:05.301 --> 00:19:09.980
And all you have to do is that sprint across the savanna kind of writ large and

309
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:12.110
out of it pops a whole bunch of diseases.

310
00:19:12.111 --> 00:19:15.650
If you're constantly mobilizing energy for those thigh muscles that are

311
00:19:15.651 --> 00:19:18.140
preparing to run you across the Savanna, as you wonder,

312
00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:22.400
is Social Security gonna be there in 30 years if you're constantly doing that

313
00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:26.120
really nervous prison. Yes. Well,

314
00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:29.420
I studied this subject. It's not by chance.

315
00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:32.660
What do you think this was a coin toss? Um,

316
00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:37.910
I worry about being ethnically cleansed by Serbian, you know, roads,

317
00:19:37.911 --> 00:19:41.590
that sort of thing. And I'm sitting here in Palo Alto. Um, you know,

318
00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.990
if you constantly mobilize energy, you don't store it.

319
00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:48.560
And for really complex reasons, you're more at risk for this disease.

320
00:19:48.561 --> 00:19:52.820
Adult onset diabetes. This is one of those great diseases that our great,

321
00:19:52.821 --> 00:19:56.720
great grandparents never heard of. A much more accessible versions, you know,

322
00:19:56.721 --> 00:19:59.480
increase your blood pressure out the Wazoo to run for your life.

323
00:19:59.481 --> 00:20:02.720
This is not a big deal for three minutes. Increase it chronically.

324
00:20:02.721 --> 00:20:06.230
Every time you come to work and stress induced hypertension,

325
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:08.360
you're going to damage the walls of your blood vessels.

326
00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:09.940
<v 0>No,</v>

327
00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:14.940
not everybody in the world reacts to everything as though they were an antelope

328
00:20:15.191 --> 00:20:16.780
being chased across the Savannah. I mean,

329
00:20:16.781 --> 00:20:21.610
some people can handle all kinds of stress and get through the day and other

330
00:20:21.611 --> 00:20:26.170
people succumb and that's where we ought to go. Next thing coming up,

331
00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:31.250
a particular piece of furniture and its remarkable impact on public health in a

332
00:20:32.351 --> 00:20:36.460
heartwarming tale of a baboon who changed his ways and in the process discovered

333
00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:40.490
the secret to longer life and lower stress. This is Radiolab.

334
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.590
I'm Jad at Boom Rod, Robert Krulwich and I will continue in among.
