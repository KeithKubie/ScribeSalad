00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.390
What’s actually inside that resupply capsule
going up to the ISS anyway?

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:05.640
Ice cream and snacks?

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.689
Or actual science?

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:08.220
Personal effects?

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.980
Why not all three?

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:23.480
On June 28th, CRS-7, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket
exploded on the way to resupply the International

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.560
Space Station.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.680
As of this writing the cause of the explosion
is still unknown; though it might be an overpressure

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.739
event in one of the liquid oxygen tanks...
hopefully we'll learn more soon, keep an eye

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:33.739
on DiscoveryNews.com.

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:39.309
But this comes just a few months after Russia's
Progress 59 also failed on the way to the

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:40.309
ISS.

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.789
I mean, Scott Kelly is slated to spend a full
year in space, would this mess up those plans?

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:46.989
How long can they last?

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:48.670
I HAVE QUESTIONS.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.980
Firstly, according to NASA administrator Charlie
Bolden, the ISS has enough supplies to last

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.780
QUOTE, "several months," with an April presentation
saying they could survive until September

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.159
5th with current supplies.

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:03.780
Plus, there is a Russian-flown cargo mission
slated for this Friday, July 3, and a Japanese

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.409
flight slated for August, and another SpaceX
flight in September -- so don't get your MAGs

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:09.750
in a bunch about the crew.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.259
The ISS isn't COMPLETELY dependent on us down
here!

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:21.170
The ISS uses Water Reclamation and Oxygen
Generation systems pioneered for submarines.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.719
Water is reclaimed from washing, humidity
condensation, urination and so on, anywhere

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:27.730
they can capture water it's done.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.340
Then they purify it to super-high standards
before recycling it for showers, drinking

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.329
water and oxygen generation.

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:39.260
To create oxygen, they run electricity through
the H2O, splitting the hydrogen from the oxygen

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.070
molecules and creating O2 in a process called
electrolysis -- boom!

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.409
Oxygen (and hydrogen)!

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:51.170
But before you ask those H's are then fed
into the Sabatier System -- which uses a catalyst

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.490
to combine the hydrogen and exhaled carbon
dioxide to create H2O and CH4 -- methane.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.020
The water is recycled and the methane is vented
into space.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.240
This can produce about 2 kilos of oxygen per
day, enough for about 2 people with a little

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.000
extra -- when more people are up there, they
have pressurized tanks from Earth too…

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.380
Of course, that brings us back to the failed
cargo missions.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.560
A Dragon capsule can hold 4000 pounds of cargo
(1800 kg), in the 883 cubic feet of space

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.200
(11 m3) -- the cargo capacity of about 6 minivans.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.860
The CRS-7 that exploded contained "materials
to support more than 30 student research investigations

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.570
and more than 35 of approximately 250 science
and research

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.730
investigations that will occur during Expeditions
44 and 45."

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.980
They were sending equipment to examine meteors
entering the atmosphere, Microsoft HoloLenses,

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.520
and equipment to prep for deep space exploration
by testing the effects of microgravity on

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:46.590
astronaut Scott Kelly, and the ability to
grow food in space.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.810
The CRS-7 also contained new docking attachments
to expand commercial docking with the ISS,

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.160
plus food and other standard resupply mission
materials.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.210
According to government contractor, Lockheed-Martin,
ISS resupply contains hardware, experiments,

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.040
food, toothpaste, cleaning supplies, laptops,
printers, you name it.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.890
It's essential to pack these items securely
and with a plan, in case of leakage or failure.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:16.150
For example, bleach is never packed with cleaner,
because if they leak, the fumes are poisonous.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.000
The Dragon's interior is pressurized and can
hold a variety of NASA cargo bags and freezers

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.460
for carrying materials such as biological
samples!

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.940
They even shipped Bluebell ice cream up once!

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.480
Obviously, in this case, it was a total loss.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.480
Sure, the explosion is a pretty serious situation,
and all SpaceX flights are grounded until

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.980
they find the exact cause, but at least no
lives were lost.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.030
As sad as it is; experiments, food, and materials
can be replaced.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.960
The ISS flies at an average altitude of 248
miles (400 kilometers), and it's one of the

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.480
most challenging and dangerous road trips
humans regularly undertake.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.480
As Charlie Bolden said in a NASA release on
the CRS-7, "This is a reminder that spaceflight

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.010
is an incredible challenge, but we learn from
each success and each setback."

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.010
What do you think of all this?

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.870
Should we put more money into the space program?

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:30.880
Or are we wasting our time?
