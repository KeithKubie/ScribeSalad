STEVE JAMISON: Brad,
this is your kind

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.724
of place-- Google, informal.

00:00:05.724 --> 00:00:06.890
BRAD GILBERT: Very informal.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.620
You know, I learned
to work in my shorts.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.710
I like to see that everybody--
there's bright people here,

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.460
but it's not about
wearing a suit and tie.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.780
STEVE JAMISON: It's
very good, yeah.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.149
This is informal
Friday, but I've

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.273
got a feeling the rest of
the week's about the same

00:00:18.273 --> 00:00:19.840
as far as dress.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.620
Now, that first clip
we saw before Agassi,

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.336
you tell me that was you?

00:00:25.336 --> 00:00:26.680
BRAD GILBERT: That was me, yeah.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.590
You know, what's funny
is back in the mid '80s,

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.990
you think you're hip when
you're wearing tight shorts,

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.500
you're wearing high socks.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.570
I had the bad kind of
fro-mullet type thing.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.590
But as I've gotten older,
now it's like long shorts,

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.280
it's like no socks,
and the hair is tight.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.894
It's funny when you
see those old clips.

00:00:49.894 --> 00:00:52.560
What's funny is, many, the older
I get, the better I used to be.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.970
STEVE JAMISON: Yeah.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.053
Well, you look pretty good,
but you made a comment

00:00:55.053 --> 00:00:57.694
about the speed of the
game back then and now.

00:00:57.694 --> 00:01:01.390
BRAD GILBERT: Well, do you
remember about the first time

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.680
that you used the internet?

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.410
It was like a dial-up, and
you had to use the phone,

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.282
and it would kill
the line or whatever.

00:01:08.282 --> 00:01:10.240
That's kind of how it
looks when you see tennis

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.720
from the '80s, amazing how
much faster they're playing

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.110
and how much more athletic
the game has become.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.460
STEVE JAMISON: Well, I want
to ask you some questions,

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.959
and we're going to take a lot
of questions from the audience

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:21.910
here and watching.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.590
But when you were playing,
some amazing things happened.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.970
You rose to number four
in the world at one point.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.010
You were ranked number four.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.390
The reason I say "amazing"
is because nobody

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.194
expected you to really be
an outstanding, great pro.

00:01:39.194 --> 00:01:40.860
Your mother told me
when we were working

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.340
on "Winning Ugly,"
I said, what did

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.880
you think Brad's prospects were
when he got out of high school?

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.490
And she said, we thought he'd
get a job flipping burgers.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.482
She was being a
little facetious,

00:01:52.482 --> 00:01:54.940
but she didn't think you'd get
to number four in the world.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.600
How high in the rankings-- what
was your own self-- evaluation?

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.046
BRAD GILBERT: When
I was a little kid,

00:02:02.046 --> 00:02:04.500
my dad took me to
a Davis Cup match

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.917
when I was like nine years old
at Round Hill Country Club,

00:02:06.917 --> 00:02:08.500
and he said, you're
playing Davis Cup,

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.291
and you're going to be
a pro tennis player.

00:02:10.291 --> 00:02:12.804
So I kind of always
thought, OK, he must know.

00:02:12.804 --> 00:02:14.380
That's what I'm going to do.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.680
For me, my entire tennis
career changed just

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.440
in a short period of time
in early January of 1980

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.410
when I went to Foothill
Junior College, which

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.590
is very close to here,
and I met a coach named

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:36.260
Tom Chivington, who explained
things very simplistically,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.170
made the approach to
the game a lot more fun.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.820
And I felt like in that
short period of time--

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.670
also, for some reason, I grew
six inches in about six weeks,

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:45.540
which really helped.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.380
But that's where things
really clicked in for me.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.520
I never really thought about
where I was going to go.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.200
Just for me, the whole thing was
about the journey to get better

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.557
and just to see
where I could go.

00:02:58.557 --> 00:03:00.140
I think part of it
is just never being

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.790
satisfied with where you are.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.110
STEVE JAMISON: When we were
working on "Winning Ugly,"

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.030
I interviewed Coach Chivington.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.030
I said, what did
you see in Brad that

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.366
was good enough to get him to
your college and your coaching?

00:03:13.366 --> 00:03:14.990
And he said, it was
a very funny thing.

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.780
I scouted him in
three or four matches.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.557
He said, there's
a check-off list

00:03:18.557 --> 00:03:20.640
that you go through when
you're watching a player.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.600
I'd watch Brad, and there's
a check-off for forehand.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.030
No forehand.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.870
No back hand.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:27.500
Overhead?

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.160
Shaky.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.090
Second serve?

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.880
None.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.520
And he said at the bottom of the
page, he wrote, but Brad wins.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.050
And that goes to the whole
secret of your success,

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.200
in a sense, and it's what
the book is all about.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.840
There's not a single
stroke tip here.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.130
It's all about the secret of
winning ugly, which is mental.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.910
It's the mental
skill that you had

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.401
that was, in my view, your
strongest weapon and stronger

00:03:53.401 --> 00:03:55.650
than any of the others out
there at the time, the guys

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:56.410
you were playing.

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.930
Lendl had the big
forehand, the big backhand.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.420
You had it up here.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.042
Can you expand on that a little?

00:04:02.042 --> 00:04:03.530
BRAD GILBERT: Well,
to me, I always

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.024
feel like as a tennis
player and in my coaching,

00:04:06.024 --> 00:04:08.690
you've got to learn to be honest
with yourself what you do well,

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.790
what you don't do well,
and try to maximize

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.160
what you're doing out there.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.450
You know, I think a lot
about what I'm trying to do,

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:25.270
but I try not to completely
kill myself when it's over.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.140
I feel like the most important
thing is that you give 100%.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.220
You compete, you love
what you're doing,

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.480
and you try to
figure out how you

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.200
can maximize what you're doing.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.520
And basically, to be
honest with you, that's

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.060
all I was thinking I was doing.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.320
People would say that I'm
overachieving all the time,

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.040
and I'd kind of
look at them, why?

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.710
That's what your expectation
is because I'm overachieving.

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:45.910
I actually don't think I am.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.944
I think I can do better.

00:04:47.944 --> 00:04:49.610
STEVE JAMISON: The
whole book is nothing

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.239
but golden nuggets of
how to maximize yourself

00:04:53.239 --> 00:04:54.030
as a tennis player.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.800
One of the things you
said in our conversations

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.030
was my whole goal is to
make the opponent beat me

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.955
with his weakest shots.

00:05:02.955 --> 00:05:05.080
And figuring that out, of
course, is the challenge,

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.240
and then making him hit those
shots is what you did so well.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.690
BRAD GILBERT: You know,
what's funny is the difference

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.930
between playing and coaching.

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.310
I had my thoughts and
styles how I played.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.240
When I started
coaching Andre, it's

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.890
amazing how, when you look
through someone else's lens,

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.000
that things can be a
little bit different.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.430
Immediately, if I thought a
guy had a really good weapon,

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.810
I was like, oh man, I'm
going to stay away from that.

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.700
And then when I would tell
Andre about a weakness,

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.200
he'd want to know
about the strength

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.110
because he goes, I want to go
right through their strength,

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.870
because he goes, you
break down their strength,

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.270
man, you just break
everything down.

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.240
Mentally, they're gone.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.910
I'm like, man, I'm
just not good enough

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.860
to be thinking about doing that.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.770
But it's amazing
how you can take

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.590
two guys, two different
lenses, and get

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.550
completely different views.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.765
STEVE JAMISON: You obviously
got him to your way of thinking.

00:05:53.765 --> 00:05:55.640
He won seven Grand Slams
with you, didn't he?

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.560
BRAD GILBERT: He did, yeah.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.935
STEVE JAMISON:
And so did you get

00:05:57.935 --> 00:06:02.120
him to exploit weakness more
and more as you guys went along?

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.350
BRAD GILBERT: The
biggest thing that I

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.840
thought when I
started with Andre,

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.620
I just told him very simply
that no matter what he did,

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:12.940
it could always be better.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.640
And his dad always
said no matter

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.840
what it was, it could
always be better.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.330
And I told him the pursuit
of perfection doesn't exist.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.590
It only makes you miserable
trying to chase it.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.020
And I said, you've just got
to learn to be good enough.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.780
You are so talented,
but yet you're

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.980
always trying to be perfect,
which is costing you

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.107
a lot of matches.

00:06:31.107 --> 00:06:32.815
I just told him, a
lot of times, you just

00:06:32.815 --> 00:06:33.773
need meat and potatoes.

00:06:33.773 --> 00:06:37.810
You just need to be at 60%
and not hitting for the lines,

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.705
not thinking about
winning one and love.

00:06:40.705 --> 00:06:43.080
STEVE JAMISON: Where was he
in the rankings when you guys

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.280
teamed up as coach and player?

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.970
BRAD GILBERT: In
1994 when we started,

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:51.140
we were playing a tournament
together in Miami,

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:56.590
and I was, I want to think,
about 22, 23 in the rankings,

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:58.690
and he was about
28 in the rankings,

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:00.955
so he was about
five spots below me.

00:07:00.955 --> 00:07:02.580
STEVE JAMISON: That's
ironic, isn't it,

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.740
because this is one of the
greatest tennis players ever.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.735
Would you rank him in
the top five, Andre?

00:07:07.735 --> 00:07:09.500
BRAD GILBERT: In the
open air, I probably

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.580
would put him right about there.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.130
A year from the day when
I started coaching him,

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:18.580
he went from 28 to 1.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.700
And once again, on
that, when I coach,

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.340
I don't think about numbers.

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.190
I just think about the journey,
the process of getting better.

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:32.690
I remember when I was coaching
Kei Nishikori in 2011,

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.860
and the Japanese
media kept asking,

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:35.290
when is he going to be this?

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:36.456
When is he going to be that?

00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:38.080
It's like any time
that you think

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.580
that you have do something,
it puts more pressure on you,

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.921
and the journey is in a player.

00:07:43.921 --> 00:07:45.170
We're going to try to improve.

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:46.545
We're going to
try to get better.

00:07:46.545 --> 00:07:48.150
We're going to work
hard, and we're

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:49.608
going to try to
make things happen.

00:07:49.608 --> 00:07:53.450
But if you put some undue number
and time frame on something,

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:55.750
it's going to make you
more conscious of it,

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:57.790
and then that's going
to become the focus.

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:00.039
STEVE JAMISON: We're going
to take some questions here

00:08:00.039 --> 00:08:02.280
in just a second, but
as you probably know,

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.050
Brad is, in the
opinion of most people,

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:08.215
the top analyst on
television today.

00:08:08.215 --> 00:08:10.580
At ESPN, he does all
of the Grand Slams

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.050
and a bunch of
other tournaments.

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:16.630
And so you know modern tennis
as well as anyone out there.

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:20.520
On the men's side, who
out there in the top 10

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:24.160
do you think you could
help the most as a coach?

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.617
Or don't you want the answer
getting back to the player?

00:08:26.617 --> 00:08:28.700
BRAD GILBERT: I mean, life
would be easy right now

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.400
if you just rocked up and then
you were coaching Djokovic.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.669
He's on auto-pilot.

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:35.840
I mean, how good would
it have been the last 10

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.020
years to be Fed's coach?

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:42.110
To me, right now,
we're in an era

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:48.640
of seeing so quickly after
the Andre/Pete thing,

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.690
that you would think, OK, maybe
there would be a little time

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:53.510
frame there would have
been some jockeying,

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:56.230
but it's amazing how
quickly we got Fed, and then

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:58.700
Nadal, now Djokovic, Murray.

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:01.300
To me, I've never seen
better athleticism

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:04.330
in the game, better
all-around movement.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:08.140
And the skill set-- I was
sitting courtside in Miami

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:12.860
and watching the way
that Djokovic moves.

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:16.540
I couldn't believe
what he was able to do,

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:19.810
his ability to stop on
a dime, be able to go,

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:23.790
to be able to find angles
and movements in his body.

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:24.520
It's incredible.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:28.250
And I'm one of
these people that I

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:30.750
feel like the modern
game is like a moving

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:31.860
escalator at the airport.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:33.830
You get off of it,
it keeps going.

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:36.610
And I think 20 years from
now, we'll continue to grow.

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:41.020
And I'm not one of these people
that we want to go backwards.

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.470
I just was in an
event in Houston,

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:46.284
and I saw an older player.

00:09:46.284 --> 00:09:47.200
He was a great player.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.050
He's in his late 70s.

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:52.140
He just was harping on me
about the volley's dead,

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:55.090
and why don't we do this,
and he hates the modern game.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:57.810
And the first thing I said to
him was-- he could barely walk.

00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:58.990
His knees were shot.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:09:59.887
His hips were gone.

00:09:59.887 --> 00:10:02.470
It's like, all the serving and
volleying has ruined your body.

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:04.500
And I was like, I really
enjoy this modern game.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.260
He goes, I hear you talk about
that crap all the time on TV.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:08.992
Go back to like we
played in the '50s.

00:10:08.992 --> 00:10:11.200
I was like, no, I don't want
to go back to that time.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.960
And I think that we're
constantly evolving and getting

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.100
better.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.210
That's what you guys are
doing here every day.

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:20.293
STEVE JAMISON: Is Serena
the best ever in women's?

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:24.990
BRAD GILBERT: She's
right there now.

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:26.710
I think the two
best female athletes

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:29.340
I've seen in my lifetime are
both female tennis players,

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.910
are Steffi Graf and
Serena Williams.

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:32.201
STEVE JAMISON: You like Steffi?

00:10:32.201 --> 00:10:35.150
BRAD GILBERT: And I think that
Serena is right on the edge,

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:37.600
and she's probably
the best tennis

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.960
player in the
history of the game,

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:44.220
male or female, at her
age, at 33, almost 34.

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.090
She's had the three
most dominant years,

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:48.890
and she's become a
great player in her 30s.

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:51.230
Her longevity is
amazing, considering she

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:55.560
won her first slam
at 17, and she's now

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.310
half that older,
almost 34, and still

00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:59.990
playing maybe better than ever.

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:05.540
I asked her a question in Miami,
and she actually got stumped.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:09.780
I said, is Serena
Williams better

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:12.440
now than she was 10 years ago?

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.550
Who would win?

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:16.720
And then she said immediately,
oh no, Serena 10 years ago

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.620
would win.

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.320
She got a little bit rattled.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.319
Then that night, I
happened to see her,

00:11:21.319 --> 00:11:22.860
and she told me she
had been thinking

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:25.460
about it for a few hours after
she just blurted it out on TV.

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:29.490
And she said that she was a lot
better, she felt like, at 33

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:33.910
than she was at 23 because a
33-year-old Serena, she said,

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:36.160
was a lot more adaptable.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.870
She'd studied the
game a lot more

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:40.560
and didn't rely as much
on her athleticism,

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.910
and she was embracing technology
that she never did then.

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:45.670
She didn't scout her opponents.

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:47.760
So she said that maybe
athletically, she

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.614
wasn't quite as good, but
she was a way smarter player.

00:11:50.614 --> 00:11:52.280
STEVE JAMISON: If you
were playing today

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:56.430
as a young Brad Gilbert, you're
24, 25 years old, how would

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:58.617
you do?

00:11:58.617 --> 00:12:00.700
BRAD GILBERT: I mean, we're
all brassed into think

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:01.800
that we'd be good.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.220
I mean, obviously, I would
have to make some changes,

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.490
but I still think I could be OK.

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:11.860
I don't know what level,
but I'm sure that I

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.012
could get a paycheck.

00:12:13.012 --> 00:12:15.220
STEVE JAMISON: Yes, I think
you could get a paycheck.

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:16.595
BRAD GILBERT: I
don't know that I

00:12:16.595 --> 00:12:18.980
would have got to four
with as good as they are,

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:21.990
but I would sure
as heck be trying.

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:23.430
I know that the
biggest difference

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:26.190
between now and
when I was playing

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:28.740
is that athletes
are living 24/7.

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:33.010
There's no off season--
the diet, the training.

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:35.680
I didn't exactly do the hard
core training that these guys--

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:36.210
STEVE JAMISON: No, you were not.

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:36.876
I knew you then.

00:12:36.876 --> 00:12:40.680
You were not the hard core
trainer that you later became.

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:43.870
BRAD GILBERT: I eat kale now
all the time, and I eat lentils.

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:45.060
I had beans for lunch.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:46.490
I don't eat anything fried.

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:47.760
My diet's 50 times better.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.134
I wish I was reborn and
had a better diet then.

00:12:51.134 --> 00:12:53.300
STEVE JAMISON: Skill-wise,
you would have done good.

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.091
BRAD GILBERT: I think
I would have been OK.

00:12:55.091 --> 00:12:56.880
I don't know how good,
but maybe coaching

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:57.964
is a better thing for me.

00:12:57.964 --> 00:12:58.880
STEVE JAMISON: Listen.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.338
I'll tell you
something about Brad,

00:13:00.338 --> 00:13:03.420
and I've said this in
front of him before.

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.930
He hit the trifecta of skills.

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:08.810
As a tennis player,
he got to number four.

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:11.673
As a coach, they
said on the air when

00:13:11.673 --> 00:13:14.580
he was coaching Andre and
this tremendous ascent,

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.980
Brad is the best tennis
coach in the world.

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:18.570
That's what many thought.

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:21.290
And now on ESPN, number one.

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:24.220
It's tremendous how you've
gone from one to the other

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:25.230
and succeeded.

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:27.110
Before we take a
question, for anybody

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:29.320
that doesn't know
what "winning ugly"

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:33.000
means in the context of
sports particularly, but life,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.610
can you give it your
definition, how it applies?

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:40.630
BRAD GILBERT: For me, it's all
about finding a way to compete

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:45.030
and not thinking it
has to be done one way.

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:50.960
To me, speaking of
winning ugly, you

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.120
know that we've gone
to another level.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:57.550
About two weeks ago, the
"Evening Standard" newspaper

00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:59.510
in London-- you ever
heard of this paper?

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:02.140
They have a politician
now in London.

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:04.196
They were calling--
Kimmie, what was his name?

00:14:04.196 --> 00:14:05.570
My wife will maybe
know his name,

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:08.660
but they were calling
this politician,

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:12.610
"he is winning ugly in
politics in London."

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:16.890
There was a giant article
comparing him to me.

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:17.640
STEVE JAMISON: No.

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:18.680
BRAD GILBERT: Honest
to God that they

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:21.079
were saying that he has
no skills of a politician,

00:14:21.079 --> 00:14:22.370
he has no this, he has no that.

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:24.530
And the entire time,
they kept comparing him

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:27.202
like 20 different times, but
yet he wins the election.

00:14:27.202 --> 00:14:28.910
STEVE JAMISON: There
you are-- no skills,

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.190
no forehand, no backhand.

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:31.481
He's going to win the election.

00:14:31.481 --> 00:14:35.240
Well, quickly, we were talking
about the Mayweather fight,

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.790
and you said about
Floyd, he's what?

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:40.860
BRAD GILBERT: To me,
I'm a huge boxing fan

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:44.500
because there are quite a few
parallels in a one-on-one sport

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:47.840
that there are in tennis,
and I like the strategy

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.320
that one person's trying
to implement to the other.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.976
And when I watch
Floyd Mayweather,

00:14:51.976 --> 00:14:53.600
because everyone
thinks about the money

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:58.244
and his incredible persona,
he's the all time winning ugly.

00:14:58.244 --> 00:14:59.410
STEVE JAMISON: Explain that.

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:02.216
BRAD GILBERT: To me, because
when you as a boxing fan

00:15:02.216 --> 00:15:04.960
or you watch boxing, you're
thinking, where's the knockout?

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.480
Where's the pizazz?

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.530
He never gets hit.

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:08.840
He's a defensive genius.

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.360
He doesn't knock guys out.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.422
He outpoints you.

00:15:11.422 --> 00:15:13.880
And a lot of times, you hear
the pundits talking about him.

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:17.100
His fights are ugly to
watch because he's boring.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:18.140
He wins.

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:20.570
He doesn't hit you that
much and doesn't get hit.

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:22.840
I'm thinking, man, he's
figured something out.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.270
He's not getting hit.

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:27.510
He's pointing you to death,
and he's boring everybody.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:29.776
So that means he must be
doing something genius-like

00:15:29.776 --> 00:15:31.650
because you can't figure
out what he's doing.

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:32.830
STEVE JAMISON: So your pick?

00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:35.415
BRAD GILBERT: Mayweather,
an easy, unanimous decision.

00:15:35.415 --> 00:15:36.540
STEVE JAMISON: No knockout?

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:36.780
BRAD GILBERT: No.

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:37.990
It'll be, like,
10 rounds to two.

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:39.510
He doesn't want to knock
him out because then he can

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:40.500
have another rematch with him.

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:41.520
STEVE JAMISON: The
whole back section just

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.103
left to place bets
with their bookies,

00:15:43.103 --> 00:15:45.790
so let's take some questions.

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:46.332
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:15:46.332 --> 00:15:47.706
STEVE JAMISON:
What is your name?

00:15:47.706 --> 00:15:49.530
AUDIENCE: My name is
Salim, and I really

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:51.110
love talking about coaching.

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:53.700
So with my son, I
don't think he'll

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:55.790
be playing in the
professional leagues,

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:58.040
but I'm trying to get him
to think about-- I love when

00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.600
he's at bat, he gets a strike.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:04.110
He just lets it go, gets
back in, and hits the ball.

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:06.340
But I'm trying to translate
this onto his schoolwork,

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:09.360
and sometimes he
does bad on a test.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.230
I'm trying to go,
think about how do you

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:12.490
do it when you get a strike?

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:14.160
You get back in there,
you hit the ball

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.690
without-- I watched him
play and I was like,

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:18.719
wow, how do you do that?

00:16:18.719 --> 00:16:20.760
I can't get him to translate
into his other work.

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.730
For me, like many other
parents, his schoolwork

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:25.920
is much more which
I'm focusing on.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:26.809
Any tips?

00:16:26.809 --> 00:16:28.600
BRAD GILBERT: It's an
interesting question.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:32.130
I was probably like your son
that I was really focused.

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:37.400
Back in the day, when we
didn't have no cable TV,

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.820
everything was about
playing sports.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.710
But obviously,
there's a balance.

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:44.310
Education is a huge thing.

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:47.230
We all wish we could be great
athletes and be pro athletes,

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:49.721
but having knowledge
is a great thing.

00:16:49.721 --> 00:16:52.095
And unfortunately, at school,
you are judged by a number.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:58.474
But to me, I think a lot of
our coaches here in the States,

00:16:58.474 --> 00:17:00.390
and I'm sure a lot of
places around the world,

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:03.230
we're obsessed in every sport
when somebody comes through,

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:05.530
you have to do it this
way to become a pro.

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:09.730
And I'm about, let's
learn to enjoy it.

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:11.994
Use the life skills,
especially like tennis.

00:17:11.994 --> 00:17:14.160
It's something you can do
for the rest of your life.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.900
It can help you.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.400
Just because you
don't become a pro,

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.358
but maybe it will help
you in your life skills,

00:17:19.358 --> 00:17:22.170
or it will help you in your job.

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:27.030
Try to do fun little games
with your kid about schoolwork.

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:29.100
We're not going
to go from, let's

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:31.350
say, if he's getting
30% to 90%, but let's

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:34.050
do games or do something
to make it fun,

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:36.660
and don't stress him about
if he's not doing great,

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:37.899
but we can do better.

00:17:37.899 --> 00:17:39.440
AUDIENCE: We have
several initiatives

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.710
around meditation, mindfulness.

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:45.780
There's lots of stories
of Phil Jackson applying

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:48.110
that kind of thing to the
MBA teams he worked with,

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:50.380
the flow state,
being in the zone.

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.725
I'm curious did you do
any of those practices?

00:17:52.725 --> 00:17:54.900
Did you and Andre work on that?

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:56.625
What advice do you have?

00:17:56.625 --> 00:17:58.800
BRAD GILBERT: It's
a good question.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.820
Myself, I didn't do anything.

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:06.510
I think I was my
own sports shrink.

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:09.290
But I just thought
about a lot myself,

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:12.300
the plan, what I was going to
do, and if it didn't go well.

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:17.850
And so I was always thinking
about just game plan.

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:20.700
I remember one time, one
of the craziest things

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:23.490
I did in my entire life,
I completely panicked.

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:26.730
There was an older tennis player
whose name was Brian Teacher,

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:29.830
and he was way into
meditation and all sorts

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:33.510
of things like yoga and all
sorts of things in the '80s I

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:34.810
didn't know about.

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:38.680
And he had at his place
called a salt tank,

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.900
and it was like this
coffin that was in water,

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:43.610
and you floated, and
they locked you in.

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:46.050
And he said, you go in
there for about 20 minutes,

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:48.490
and you just get into
deep meditation and think.

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:51.580
I think 20 seconds afterwards,
I was pounding on the door

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:53.584
that I have got to get out.

00:18:53.584 --> 00:18:54.250
I was panicking.

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:57.440
It just was not for me.

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:03.610
And then when I started coaching
Andre, I didn't really think.

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:06.220
I translated to the
things that I understood,

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:08.807
but I did understand
the one thing is now

00:19:08.807 --> 00:19:10.640
you're looking through
somebody else's lens.

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:16.950
I'm probably positive
beyond belief.

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:19.030
I'm probably annoying
about how positive we're

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:20.404
going to find
something positive,

00:19:20.404 --> 00:19:22.330
so I probably have
a little sports

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:25.290
psychology in my coaching
without having any training.

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:30.730
But no, I've never done any
meditation or visualized.

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:33.790
Sometimes people think,
visualize winning.

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:36.430
No, you've got to let
it flow a little bit.

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:39.280
And I'll give you a
question about Phil Jackson.

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:43.970
I saw him in Australia one time,
and I had a little conversation

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:46.400
with him.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.020
And I asked him,
I said, how often

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:51.990
do you go to dinner
with Kobe and Jack?

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:55.240
And he looked at me,
he said straight up,

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.720
he goes, excuse me?

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.740
And I said, how often,
away from practice,

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:02.150
do you go to dinner with
these guys, the two of them

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:02.769
or separately?

00:20:02.769 --> 00:20:04.560
Or how often do you go
with Michael Jordan?

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:05.792
He's like, never.

00:20:05.792 --> 00:20:07.250
And I said, what
do you mean never?

00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:10.432
He goes, team function,
practice, then we

00:20:10.432 --> 00:20:12.765
go our separate ways, or I
give them a book or something

00:20:12.765 --> 00:20:13.170
to read.

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:13.961
I was like, really?

00:20:13.961 --> 00:20:15.970
I said, when I was
coaching Andre,

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:18.890
we probably went to
dinner six nights a week,

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:21.550
and I said, probably the
best coaching that I did

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:24.800
was at dinner in a relaxed
setting going over strategy.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.810
And I said, sometimes that's
where you can throw out a hook

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:30.320
and find out where you're
going to go with it.

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.200
If he doesn't give
you something,

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.480
you know to back off,
and then all of a sudden,

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.440
if he is biting on
it a little bit,

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:37.880
you know which area you can go.

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:41.310
But I feel like that's the most
relaxed, easy time to coach,

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:44.147
and he wasn't buying it at all.

00:20:44.147 --> 00:20:45.980
STEVE JAMISON: How do
you like the Warriors?

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:48.660
How deep will the Warriors
go in the playoffs?

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:53.095
BRAD GILBERT: Well,
it's been since 1976,

00:20:53.095 --> 00:20:56.420
the '75-76 season since we
got to the conference finals,

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:57.860
so I'm very patient.

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:00.330
It's been 40 years.

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:02.190
I think that we've
got a very good draw.

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:04.240
I like our chances
against Memphis.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:08.050
I'm saying that we will beat
Memphis four games to one,

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:09.050
and let's go from there.

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:10.300
That will get us
in the semifinals.

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:11.310
STEVE JAMISON: OK, good.

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:14.874
BRAD GILBERT: But I won't wear a
yellow T-shirt that we believe.

00:21:14.874 --> 00:21:17.290
I'll be there Sunday, and I'll
be wearing a black T-shirt.

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:20.025
STEVE JAMISON: And you're
doing some profiles

00:21:20.025 --> 00:21:21.940
in broadcast form, right?

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:24.190
BRAD GILBERT: Well, I did a
little bit of SportsCenter

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:27.450
for them, and I did
quite a bit of radio

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:30.085
in December, branching out,
doing a little football

00:21:30.085 --> 00:21:30.711
and basketball.

00:21:30.711 --> 00:21:32.085
And so hopefully,
I'm going to be

00:21:32.085 --> 00:21:34.300
doing a couple spots
next week on SportsCenter

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:36.510
about the Doves.

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:38.590
But hopefully I can do a
little bit of bluffing,

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:40.048
but I do know the
team pretty well.

00:21:40.048 --> 00:21:41.400
STEVE JAMISON: You're good.

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.990
AUDIENCE: My name is Mike.

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:46.020
Being a Canadian, I want to
ask about two fellow Canadians,

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:47.670
Milos and Genie.

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:52.150
On Milos's front, do you think
he can evolve from where he is?

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:53.610
Can his movement improve?

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:55.570
Can he improve or is
his serve just the thing

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:56.944
and that's what
he's going to do?

00:21:56.944 --> 00:21:59.160
And on the Genie
front, is she done?

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:02.670
Has her attitude
gotten the best of her?

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:05.010
She's dropping, and
she can't seem to win.

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:07.399
What would you do with her?

00:22:07.399 --> 00:22:08.940
BRAD GILBERT: Let's
start with Milos.

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:14.080
Let's start with the upside
first of your question.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:18.020
I like to think sometimes in
tennis there's simple numbers,

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:20.250
and numbers can
tell a big story.

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:27.397
To me, Milos is at sixth in the
world, and he's kind of-- I'm

00:22:27.397 --> 00:22:28.980
not going to say in
a holding pattern,

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:33.700
but if you look at his numbers,
he's got an amazing serve,

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:36.590
but his return game,
his numbers are low.

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:38.560
And to be able to
knock on the door

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:42.190
where he's going to be able to
beat a Djokovic or beat a Fed

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:44.200
or beat a Nadal and win
one of these things,

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.490
he's got to improve.

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:50.180
He's breaking it
like 11% of the time,

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:52.280
and it's actually down
from a couple years ago

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:53.350
when it was 13, 14.

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:56.270
He holds 94% of the time.

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:58.670
But when he plays those
top three or four guys,

00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:00.700
he doesn't hold at
94% of the time.

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:03.430
Maybe it's a little less, and
actually, his break numbers

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:04.290
come down.

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:06.700
But he's going to have
to improve his break

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:09.470
number to where he can be
able to break at least 20%

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:13.000
of the time to win majors.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.630
There's a potential.

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:19.402
He's almost 24, so
his time frame is now.

00:23:19.402 --> 00:23:20.860
Obviously, Federer's
getting older,

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:24.660
Nadal is getting older,
Djokovic in his prime.

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:29.520
But he's been in that same
area for about 18 months.

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.460
I think it's potential,
but like I said,

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:34.510
I'll harp back on the return
game more than the movement,

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:37.820
more than anything else,
that he has to improve that.

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:39.580
The second part, the Genie army.

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:43.620
Genie Bouchard had an
amazing year last year,

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:46.230
an incredible year.

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:48.090
And sometimes in any
field that you're

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:51.320
in, besides tennis, beyond
business, beyond life, when

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:55.580
you have incredible
success, the expectation

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:57.800
then goes up even more.

00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:00.730
And she signed a lot of
contracts, a lot of deals,

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:03.240
and then the expectation
went up even more.

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.550
And I think more than
anything, the thing

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:09.030
that I've noticed from her
is that she's beaten herself

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:09.700
up a little bit.

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:13.130
She's playing not relaxed.

00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:16.730
She's playing with the pressure
that the expectation is there

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:18.150
for her to go to
that next level.

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:20.541
She signed all these big
deals, and you kind of

00:24:20.541 --> 00:24:22.290
see it in her face a
little bit that she's

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:25.850
struggling with that same
enjoyment and passion.

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:27.360
I think she's
incredibly talented,

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.070
she's an incredible
fighter, and I think

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:32.120
that she will figure this out.

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:35.760
She needs to get back to not
worrying about-- I always say

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:39.610
in sports, don't worry about
what some writer's going to do.

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:43.580
The one thing you can control
is what happens in front of you.

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:44.930
Now it's a blogger, anyways.

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:47.070
It's not even like
a real writer.

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:50.970
So I think to me, for her,
she's incredibly talented,

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:53.590
and she has to get back
to what she was doing.

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:55.790
I'd go back to maybe,
if I was her coach--

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:58.070
she switched coaches.

00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:00.040
Not sure that that
was a great move,

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.360
but now that's not coming back.

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:04.520
I'd maybe go back to
watching some of the videos

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:06.895
to see what she was doing when
she was playing incredibly

00:25:06.895 --> 00:25:10.080
well to what she's doing
now and try to find out

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:12.680
that balance a little bit.

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:15.490
But for me, if she
was a stock, there's

00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:18.280
no way I'm putting a sell
rating on a 9-- what, is she 20?

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.719
I mean, she's got time.

00:25:20.719 --> 00:25:21.760
She's going to come back.

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.440
STEVE JAMISON: Speaking
of time, does Federer

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:29.450
have time to win another
Grand Slam or two,

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:33.140
or is he on a descent that he
can't do that at the top level?

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:36.420
BRAD GILBERT: It's probably the
question that I'm asked most,

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:40.180
and he has most hardcore
fans that I've ever

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:41.300
seen in all of the world.

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:44.810
They take everything
literally and so serious,

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:46.560
and if you say
something about it,

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.610
I'm telling you-- on
Twitter, I call Roger,

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:52.370
I call him FedFan because he and
his fans are joined at the hip.

00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:53.600
They're so serious
about everything

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:54.516
that's said about him.

00:25:54.516 --> 00:26:01.200
But he, at 33 years old,
whatever his team has done,

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.940
he never gets hurt.

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:05.120
He's unbelievably fit.

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.890
He's so relaxed.

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:09.270
I watch him play next
month at the French.

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:11.353
He's the only guy I've
ever seen-- he doesn't even

00:26:11.353 --> 00:26:12.580
get any clay on his socks.

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:14.840
I mean, why would he
get clay on his socks?

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.030
His hair never moves.

00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:16.947
He barely ever sweats.

00:26:16.947 --> 00:26:18.571
STEVE JAMISON: I
never thought of that.

00:26:18.571 --> 00:26:19.240
Yeah.

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:23.380
BRAD GILBERT: His RF logo
is absolutely immaculate.

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:26.002
Everything about him is perfect.

00:26:26.002 --> 00:26:27.460
STEVE JAMISON: Is
the answer, then,

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:30.624
that he will win
one or two more?

00:26:30.624 --> 00:26:31.790
BRAD GILBERT: You know what?

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:34.280
I say this, and I've
said this a lot on TV.

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:36.290
It irks the Fed
fans a little bit,

00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:41.040
but I think that
he is still playing

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:45.510
amazing at number two in the
world, but in best of three,

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:47.440
he seems to play a
little better now.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:52.030
But in women's tennis, take
Serena at the same age.

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:54.120
Women's tournaments
are best of three,

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:56.750
and then majors
are best of three.

00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:59.170
In men's, the only
thing is that now you

00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:01.320
add in it's best of five.

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:05.710
So the physical part can
be a little bit tougher,

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:08.330
and I do think that
to win a major,

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:13.570
he needs a little bit of help,
meaning that I'm not sure

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:17.430
that he can go through a Djoc or
Murray, or go through a Djoc--

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:21.700
beat two of those guys in
consecutive matches to win one.

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:25.960
So I think that
maybe to win one now,

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:28.890
he'd have to have
one of them lose.

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:32.900
I thought he would win the Open
last year when they all lost,

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:35.590
and surprisingly, he
lost to Cilic there,

00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:36.900
who he had never lost to.

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:40.370
But that's what I think
he needs to have happen.

00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:46.240
But he still is remarkably
in amazing shape for his age,

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:50.290
and I think that for 33,
is more like a 28-year-old.

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:53.530
AUDIENCE: There's no
American in the ATP Top 10.

00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:56.480
What is the outlook
for the next generation

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:59.570
and what may be missing
that the US has not produced

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:01.144
a star in the last 10 years?

00:28:01.144 --> 00:28:02.560
BRAD GILBERT: It's
a good question

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.660
that we get tired of answering.

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:08.480
And obviously, in the States,
we have absolutely amazing

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:09.250
athletes.

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:11.580
I mean, look at football,
basketball, and baseball,

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:14.690
but let's take basketball, a
guy like LeBron James or Kobe

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:17.260
Bryant, who I think would have
been an amazing tennis player.

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:20.030
But those three sports are
subsidized by the government.

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:21.740
They're in schools,
and a lot of times,

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:23.590
you don't have to leave
your area code to be

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:25.230
great in one of those sports.

00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:29.140
In tennis, unfortunately, to
be great from a young age,

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:32.650
it takes a lot of traveling,
it takes a lot of money

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:35.250
to produce a great champion.

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:37.940
Right now on the
female side, there's

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:42.180
no doubt that we are getting
the best athletes in the world

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:45.050
on the American side to play
women's tennis because there's

00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:47.831
not a sport in the world that's
even comparable to women's

00:28:47.831 --> 00:28:48.330
tennis.

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:52.230
It's by far the biggest
sport in the world anywhere.

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:55.690
I believe eight of the
top nine highest grossing

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:58.680
female athletes in the
world are tennis players.

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:00.400
And obviously, in
tennis, we compete

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:03.520
with so many other sports.

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.824
I just did an event
yesterday for Har-Tru,

00:29:05.824 --> 00:29:07.990
and I've been saying this
for about three years now.

00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:11.140
For the United States
to get a lot better,

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:14.220
we need a lot more
kids playing on clay,

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:15.590
learning to play on clay.

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:17.820
It teaches you a
lot more discipline

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:19.400
and teaches you how
to build a point.

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.250
All the great Europeans
that are great

00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:24.660
now all learned to play on
clay, and the biggest change

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:28.200
in my lifetime is that the
grass is way slower now.

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.950
Indoors are slower, hard courts.

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:32.860
So if you learn to
play on clay, it

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:35.820
transitions you into playing
on all other surfaces.

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:39.690
When I learned to play as a
kid, I played in two parks,

00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:41.550
one called Golden
Gate Park and one

00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:43.100
called Davie Tennis Stadium.

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:45.590
Golden Gate Park, you could
literally look down the court

00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:48.075
and see a reflection of yourself
because the courts hadn't

00:29:48.075 --> 00:29:49.380
been resurfaced in 30 years.

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:51.970
They're so fast, and so a
lot of the American players

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:53.990
learned to play on
fast courts and so many

00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:57.050
of the courts we played on
tour were on fast courts.

00:29:57.050 --> 00:29:59.390
That's all changed,
so I think we really

00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:04.570
do need to embrace clay and get
it in a lot more tournaments.

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:05.970
I'm going to be patient.

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:07.530
I'm going to be hopeful.

00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:12.590
But we do at the moment have
a great crop of about half

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:15.390
a dozen 17-year-old
male players,

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:18.360
and I'm hoping a
couple of these guys

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:23.360
are going to break through,
that maybe in five years,

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:25.912
we're going to put a buy
rating on a few of these stocks

00:30:25.912 --> 00:30:27.370
and they're going
to be our answer.

00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:28.930
Or five years from
now, I'll still

00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:32.430
be talking about
on TV, god, it's

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:35.760
been since 2003 that
Roddick's won the Open.

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:36.820
It is what is.

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:38.960
I'm going to be
patient, but I'll

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.460
go back to that clay thing.

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:43.410
We need to embrace clay
a lot more in the States.

00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:45.671
STEVE JAMISON: Give us two
names of that young group

00:30:45.671 --> 00:30:47.420
that you're talking
about so I can go home

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:50.280
and google them tonight and
see a little more about them.

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:52.400
BRAD GILBERT:
Francis Tiafoe, who's

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.765
from College Park,
Maryland, who's 17.

00:30:54.765 --> 00:30:58.060
He turned pro, and he signed.

00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:00.444
He's the first tennis
client from Roc Nation.

00:31:00.444 --> 00:31:01.360
You know what that is?

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:06.544
It's the new sports agency
from-- what's the rapper?

00:31:06.544 --> 00:31:07.210
AUDIENCE: Jay-Z.

00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:08.290
BRAD GILBERT: Jay-Z.
OK, there you go.

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:08.490
See?

00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:09.240
That's above us.

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.000
STEVE JAMISON: Does
Jay-Z know Dory?

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.450
BRAD GILBERT: I'm sure he does.

00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:15.214
But Francis Tiafoe has a
chance to be very good.

00:31:15.214 --> 00:31:16.380
STEVE JAMISON: OK, one more.

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:18.057
BRAD GILBERT: Reilly Opelka.

00:31:18.057 --> 00:31:19.140
STEVE JAMISON: From where?

00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:24.260
BRAD GILBERT: He is from--
it's near Jacksonville

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:29.230
and he trains in Boca, and he's
six foot 11 as a 17-year-old,

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:30.880
so he's going to
be another Isner.

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:31.750
STEVE JAMISON: Yeah.

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:33.400
Can Isner win a Grand Slam?

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.450
BRAD GILBERT: Not at 30, no.

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:37.280
STEVE JAMISON: Can this
guy at that height?

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:38.446
BRAD GILBERT: You know what?

00:31:38.446 --> 00:31:40.530
He's incredibly skillful.

00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:45.070
He's more skillful than Isner,
way more at the same age.

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:47.970
But Francis Tiafoe
is more of a modern,

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:50.470
6'1, moves like Djokovic.

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:53.169
So I believe that he's our most
talented guy in a long time.

00:31:53.169 --> 00:31:54.960
STEVE JAMISON: If they
called you and said,

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.876
we'll give you $1 million
a year to coach him,

00:31:56.876 --> 00:31:59.010
would you quit everything
else and go to Florida?

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:01.090
BRAD GILBERT: That's a
big if, but you know.

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:02.090
STEVE JAMISON: Question.

00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:02.960
BRAD GILBERT: Yeah,
you've been freezing him

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:03.876
out in the back there.

00:32:03.876 --> 00:32:05.480
STEVE JAMISON: Yes, go ahead.

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:08.290
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
about the training changing

00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:09.560
since when you played.

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:11.809
Can you describe a
little bit about how much

00:32:11.809 --> 00:32:13.850
time people spend off the
court and what they do?

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:16.420
We heard the
stories about Agassi

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:19.790
running hills in Vegas
in triple digit heat,

00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:21.300
so if you can talk
a little bit more

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:24.270
in detail about how much time
the top players are spending

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:25.501
off the court in training.

00:32:25.501 --> 00:32:27.000
BRAD GILBERT: It's
a great question.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.416
The biggest thing
that's obviously

00:32:28.416 --> 00:32:31.030
changed since I've been
a kid and in my lifetime,

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:34.380
when I was 12, if
I wasn't playing

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:35.990
tennis, which I
played a lot, I was

00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:37.590
playing basketball every day.

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:38.990
I was playing other sports.

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:41.550
I was doing everything I could
to avoid going to school,

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:43.300
but I was playing sports.

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:48.930
When I was in high
school, if a guy

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:52.630
was the quarterback on
the team, he probably

00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:54.330
played umpteen positions.

00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:55.590
He was on the basketball team.

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:56.756
He was on the baseball team.

00:32:56.756 --> 00:32:58.380
Everybody played
multiple sports.

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:02.390
But now, at 10 years old,
if somebody's playing

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:04.470
and they're good in
lacrosse, they play lacrosse.

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:06.430
If they play tennis,
they play tennis.

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:09.430
So many families, when
they have a kid that's

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:13.330
decent in one thing, they go
all in in playing one sport,

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:16.330
and they're training a lot more.

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:18.940
I mean, you go down to
Bolliterri's, and 10,

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:22.440
11-year-olds are in the gym
doing specific workouts.

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:25.320
They're on unbelievable diets.

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:28.740
And I'm like, man, it's
incredible the technology

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:30.970
that we're building.

00:33:30.970 --> 00:33:35.260
And my first thought
is at that age

00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:38.090
that we shouldn't be thinking
about them being pros.

00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:43.200
Let's think about them enjoying
this journey for a lifetime,

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:45.210
becoming a better person,
getting education,

00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:48.780
and then we can think about
as we get a little more

00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:50.340
advanced to thinking about it.

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:54.380
But for sure, even the
kid that's really good

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:56.710
now in basketball
when he's 12, he's

00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:58.020
not playing three other sports.

00:33:58.020 --> 00:33:59.550
He's just playing basketball.

00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:03.730
So that's the biggest thing I've
seen in the States by far is

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:10.190
specializing in one sport
and doing it all year round.

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:13.360
To your question about
Andre, as you get older,

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:16.320
I think you need less
time on the court and more

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:18.510
time in the gym.

00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:22.360
So when Andre was probably
30, he spent a lot less time

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:26.300
on the court and more time
probably working on his body.

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:28.449
And I think when
you're 15, you need

00:34:28.449 --> 00:34:31.840
a lot more time on the court
and probably less on the gym.

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:35.360
So it's specific
to what you are,

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:39.840
but I think you need
anything, more hours of it,

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:41.520
when you're a kid.

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:42.110
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:42.984
My name is Lazlo.

00:34:42.984 --> 00:34:47.560
So I quite recently read "The
Open" by Andre, his biography.

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:49.060
BRAD GILBERT: It's
a good book, huh?

00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:49.850
AUDIENCE: It's a
great book, actually.

00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:50.849
It's very inspirational.

00:34:50.849 --> 00:34:52.840
And I think he quite
clearly credits you

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:56.339
with shifting his whole
perception of what

00:34:56.339 --> 00:34:57.640
a challenge is in life.

00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:01.590
So when he speaks about being
defeated by Pete Sampras

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:03.820
and what that does to
him psychologically,

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:06.040
and when you come into
the picture in the book,

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:09.376
suddenly anything that
gets thrown at him,

00:35:09.376 --> 00:35:11.250
he takes it with a
totally different attitude

00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:14.540
to say whatever doesn't
kill you makes you stronger.

00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:18.080
So you already talked about
your innate, natural, boundless

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:18.790
optimism.

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:20.930
Besides that, did you
have any other, let's say,

00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:26.350
life experiences or big losses
that helped frame that mindset

00:35:26.350 --> 00:35:28.410
that you brought into
his life and made

00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:31.380
him that kind of champion?

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:33.950
BRAD GILBERT: I'll tell you,
I am the beer drinking guy

00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:35.940
who loves doing what I'm doing.

00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:39.360
And at least in my tennis
career and my beliefs,

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:41.490
I had short-term memory loss.

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:43.990
I could get waxed.

00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:46.300
And you know, I could be
pissed for 15 minutes,

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:49.010
but then I'm going to wake
up tomorrow, and it's gone.

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:55.850
The most important thing as
a tennis player and in life,

00:35:55.850 --> 00:35:58.230
yesterday ain't coming back.

00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:00.350
The only thing that
matters is tomorrow.

00:36:00.350 --> 00:36:02.610
That's what we can
change the approach to.

00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:06.910
And to Andre, tomorrow was--
he could beat himself up

00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:09.820
for six months over something
that happened yesterday.

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:12.740
He could bite his fingers
to the bone, bite the nails.

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:15.820
I didn't quite understand
that whole process

00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:19.980
how he could grind himself down
when we can learn something

00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:22.230
from this loss and get better.

00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:25.120
I told Andre if I
had his backhand,

00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:26.890
that I wouldn't sleep at night.

00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:29.270
I'd just be cashing checks.

00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:32.934
He goes, if I had your shitty
backhand, I wouldn't sleep.

00:36:32.934 --> 00:36:34.600
I don't think I could
make the pro tour.

00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:45.130
But to me, I got Andre
thinking more about percentage,

00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:47.682
because I felt like
as talented as he was,

00:36:47.682 --> 00:36:52.820
he was trying to be too perfect
or trying to make everything

00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:56.429
about just being at the
bar that was too high,

00:36:56.429 --> 00:36:58.470
and sometimes, you don't
know how high the bar is

00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:00.750
going to be.

00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:03.090
In tennis, the
simplistic thing is

00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:05.090
that you've just got
to be good enough

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:07.360
to beat the guy on the
other side of the net.

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:11.100
In the entire, huge
tournament, as two men enter,

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:12.460
one man leaves.

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:13.920
And you don't play
the whole draw.

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:15.503
You just play somebody
every other day

00:37:15.503 --> 00:37:17.540
in a major or every
day in a tournament,

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:20.790
and you've got to figure out
specifically how to strategize,

00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:23.330
how to get past that person.

00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:26.490
And then when it's
over, what we can learn

00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:29.720
and what we can figure out, and
the whole journey and process

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:32.480
opposed to having
this pre-thought.

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:35.940
Sometimes he could
literally work his way

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:38.670
into thinking that there
was no chance today

00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:40.420
based upon how he practiced.

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:42.910
And I was like, how
could you work a thought

00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:45.380
into what's going to
happen before it's even

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:46.577
started to happen?

00:37:46.577 --> 00:37:47.660
But he was so intelligent.

00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:49.920
He also blew me away.

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:52.630
The most incredible thing
that I was shocked about Andre

00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:56.640
was he only went to school
until he was about 13,

00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:00.620
and the guy is one of
the brightest people

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:01.930
I've ever met in my life.

00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:06.420
He has an absolutely
photographic memory,

00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:07.470
like scary.

00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:10.340
He could remember every
name in the phone book.

00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:13.744
So we started talking after the
first match that I coached him,

00:38:13.744 --> 00:38:15.910
and I was kind of assuming
that he'd be a little bit

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:19.880
aloof about tennis because
of the hair and the clothes

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:23.450
and how he was, and
he started telling me.

00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:26.600
When I would tell them about the
point at 4-3, how he played it,

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:30.825
he could remember every
single point of every rally.

00:38:30.825 --> 00:38:34.030
He'd tell me the 17 ball rally.

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:35.530
This was when we
didn't have videos,

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:37.369
and there was no
going to YouTube,

00:38:37.369 --> 00:38:38.410
and he could remember it.

00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:41.400
So he challenged me
incredibly that way.

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:44.550
And so I think from that moment
on, I was like, you know what?

00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:46.300
You cannot judge a
book by its cover.

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:50.146
But I think, to your point,
the biggest thing was I just

00:38:50.146 --> 00:38:52.520
tried to get a little more
meat and potatoes in his game,

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:56.270
a little more
simplistic, and just

00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:58.330
your talent is way good enough.

00:38:58.330 --> 00:39:01.560
You don't have to be any
better than what you are.

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:04.330
STEVE JAMISON: Here's a quick
story about Andre and Brad

00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:06.410
at the tournament at
Indian Wells right

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:08.830
at the height of your
collaboration on coaching

00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:09.800
with him.

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:12.170
You guys were having dinner
at Ruth Chris one night

00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:14.440
at Palm Desert, and I was
there with my parents.

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:15.720
They were quite old.

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:18.880
And I saw you over
there and I said, Dad,

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:20.950
I want you to meet somebody.

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:23.270
You were having dinner with
Andre, just the two of you.

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:25.230
So we come around, and
my dad had his cane

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:27.034
and he's walking up,
and I come around,

00:39:27.034 --> 00:39:29.200
and you're in this big
booth, and I said, hey, Brad.

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.510
Oh, hey, Steve, how you doing?

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:33.750
I said, I've got somebody
that wants to meet you,

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:35.020
and it's my dad.

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:37.219
He talks to you, tells you
what a great book it is,

00:39:37.219 --> 00:39:39.260
what a great coach you
are, turns and walks away,

00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:42.035
and Andre's waiting, never
said a word to Andre.

00:39:42.035 --> 00:39:43.410
Andre was good
about it, but it's

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:45.409
the only time that ever
happened to him where

00:39:45.409 --> 00:39:46.450
they want to talk to you.

00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:47.980
BRAD GILBERT: That's for sure.

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:48.730
STEVE JAMISON: OK.

00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:49.887
Another question.

00:39:49.887 --> 00:39:51.970
AUDIENCE: "Winning Ugly"
was one of the best books

00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:53.359
on fencing that I've ever read.

00:39:53.359 --> 00:39:54.400
BRAD GILBERT: On fencing?

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:54.600
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:55.990
BRAD GILBERT: OK, I like that.

00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:56.730
It's one on one.

00:39:56.730 --> 00:39:57.540
See?

00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:59.810
AUDIENCE: Yeah, exactly,
and it changed the way

00:39:59.810 --> 00:40:01.760
like pack your bag,
bring an extra pair

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:06.010
of shoes, All of the
nuggets of practical things

00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:09.090
that you can do to
compete and get better.

00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:11.790
What other sports do you
think "Winning Ugly" would

00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:13.950
transfer to aside from tennis?

00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:20.280
BRAD GILBERT: The way I think,
honestly, obviously, anything

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:24.499
that I see in sports,
immediately, I sometimes

00:40:24.499 --> 00:40:26.540
look through the lens of
the player or the coach,

00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:30.700
and I always think about--
in anything that I'm seeing.

00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:32.500
And I'm one of the
only Americans,

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:34.710
early on in my career,
that I took the time

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:36.090
to actually understand cricket.

00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:36.900
I like cricket.

00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:38.100
I like soccer.

00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:41.280
I'll watch and try to
understand any sport,

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:44.180
and I'm trying to think about
how, in anything that you do,

00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:46.172
that you can maximize
your potential.

00:40:46.172 --> 00:40:47.630
How are you going
to do what you're

00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:49.020
going to do and do it better?

00:40:52.036 --> 00:40:56.020
I want to know not
just on your skill set.

00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:58.230
One of my most
frustrating things

00:40:58.230 --> 00:41:01.766
is somebody be
amazingly athletic,

00:41:01.766 --> 00:41:03.140
and you hear the
commentator say,

00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:05.610
but he doesn't get
anything out of his talent.

00:41:05.610 --> 00:41:08.880
I want the guy that's
unbelievably athletic

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:10.700
but gets more out of his talent.

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:12.160
And so that's what
I would always

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:16.210
think about when
somebody's doing something.

00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:19.420
What's that little 2% or
4% that can be better?

00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:21.540
And I imagine in
fencing and wrestling

00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:23.950
and boxing, anything
that's one on one,

00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:25.315
it gets my mind thinking more.

00:41:25.315 --> 00:41:26.690
But I promise you,
whether or not

00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:28.190
it's football,
basketball, baseball,

00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:30.470
I'm always thinking the
same thing as the player,

00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:31.280
as the coach.

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:33.400
I probably drive my
wife crazy with that

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:38.689
about thinking about the
strategy because I always do.

00:41:38.689 --> 00:41:39.980
You're thinking about your bag.

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:41.313
I was a little crazy about that.

00:41:41.313 --> 00:41:44.019
I would check my bag five
times just to make sure.

00:41:44.019 --> 00:41:45.810
When you're not quite
as good as everybody,

00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:47.226
you've got to make
sure you've got

00:41:47.226 --> 00:41:48.660
the kitchen sink in your bag.

00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:51.110
AUDIENCE: Here's a direct
question from Jim Young.

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:55.301
What pros, either on
the ATP or the WPA tour,

00:41:55.301 --> 00:41:56.300
would you like to coach?

00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:01.020
BRAD GILBERT: Well, life
would be really easy

00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:02.350
if I was coaching Djokovic.

00:42:02.350 --> 00:42:04.560
I mean, he's at amazing level.

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:09.050
But if I was to coach--
and I say never say never

00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:14.960
about anything; I know ESPN
could be on this story--

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:18.800
I actually feel like
whoever it is, man or woman,

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:23.750
that I want to start with
them younger because you have

00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:30.160
a chance to build,
younger meaning under 25,

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:33.240
and preferably in
their early 20s

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:34.980
that we have a chance
to grow together,

00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:37.130
and you have a
chance to maybe make

00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:40.940
a few subtle changes that
when they're older maybe not.

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:43.570
But I promise you, if I was
coaching Djokovic right now,

00:42:43.570 --> 00:42:44.729
I'd just be kicking back.

00:42:44.729 --> 00:42:45.520
Life would be good.

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:48.050
You'd just rock up every
day, probably say as little

00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:52.870
as possible, not
screw things up.

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:54.290
Same like Serena.

00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:55.060
Life is good.

00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:56.780
She never loses.

00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:59.720
But it would be
a player younger.

00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:02.930
There's a couple of
incredible young-- right

00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:04.670
now is an exciting
time in the men's game

00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:06.753
because obviously we have
the established players,

00:43:06.753 --> 00:43:09.500
but we got some
incredible young players.

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:10.680
I like to do the nicknames.

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:12.096
There's one guy
named Borna Coric.

00:43:12.096 --> 00:43:15.340
I call him Borna Identity
Coric, a young Croatian

00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:16.690
kid that's going to be great.

00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:20.580
Kyrgios from Australia,
Zverev from Germany.

00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:22.930
So there's an exciting
time with teenagers

00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:25.680
that I believe the next few
years, one of these teenagers

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:27.620
is going to be the next guy.

00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:31.399
And I think the same thing that
Serena is probably-- things

00:43:31.399 --> 00:43:32.440
are going to change over.

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:34.850
But it would
definitely be somebody

00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:39.220
that's late teens, early 20s.

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:42.370
AUDIENCE: As you were talking,
I was thinking a little bit

00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:48.020
about maximizing opportunity,
maximizing time, particularly.

00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:50.840
I played tennis growing
up and in college,

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:53.230
and the warm-up
always seemed to me

00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:57.510
like this is my time to
scout out my opponent,

00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:59.370
especially I didn't
have the option

00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:02.790
to really know what's
their weakness, what's

00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:05.930
their strength, can they move,
can they hit an overhead,

00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:08.090
whatever it was.

00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:12.160
And I'm just curious-- did you
have any strategies, especially

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:17.390
now as an amateur and not
having that option anymore,

00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:21.290
when you have the 5-minute,
maybe 10-minute warm-up

00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:28.950
things to do to start moving
and have one step in front

00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:30.642
of your opponent?

00:44:30.642 --> 00:44:31.600
STEVE JAMISON: Page 43.

00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:33.183
BRAD GILBERT: I'm
going to promise you

00:44:33.183 --> 00:44:35.860
I'm going to just
give you a golf clap.

00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:38.680
I happened to be doing
a Skype the other day

00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:40.460
with a girl that
I'm working with,

00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:41.855
this very talented 14-year-old.

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:50.490
When I first hit the road
when I was 19 playing in Asia,

00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:53.730
beyond a cellphone,
a computer, if you

00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:57.370
got a fax that had
the "Herald Tribune,"

00:44:57.370 --> 00:44:59.240
that was three days of reading.

00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:01.890
So you literally had to do
all your scouting yourself,

00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:03.360
and I would write
and make notes.

00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:07.890
But now, you can go to YouTube
and get a little clip almost

00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:09.690
on anybody.

00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:11.652
So she was asking
me about, OK, I

00:45:11.652 --> 00:45:13.110
don't know anything
about my player

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:14.720
that I'm playing against.

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:17.065
And I brought up, then
your match completely

00:45:17.065 --> 00:45:19.130
starts in the warm-up.

00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:22.350
Hit every ball to one
side in the warm-up

00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:24.590
to see if all of a
sudden she runs around,

00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:26.980
if she prefers the
forehand, the backhand.

00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:30.190
Kind of screw your warm-up a
little bit to find out what she

00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:31.300
likes, what she doesn't.

00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:33.960
It's kind of like, OK, that's
your quick way to scout.

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:34.960
If you hit the ball
down the middle,

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:35.920
does she take it
on the forehand,

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:37.294
does she take it
on the backhand?

00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:44.080
I really think that knowledge,
because so many players

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:45.061
are talented.

00:45:45.061 --> 00:45:45.560
It's funny.

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:49.840
I've worked with some players
that they absorb knowledge

00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:51.510
or they're afraid of knowledge.

00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:55.610
And sometimes, to me, when
you're afraid of knowledge,

00:45:55.610 --> 00:45:57.610
you don't want to know
your opponent's strengths

00:45:57.610 --> 00:45:58.690
and weaknesses.

00:45:58.690 --> 00:46:00.859
I kind of cringe
and I'm like, why?

00:46:00.859 --> 00:46:03.150
Why wouldn't you want to know
your opponent's strengths

00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:08.170
and weaknesses, that maybe now
what you can do can maximize?

00:46:08.170 --> 00:46:11.280
And obviously, sometimes
at the highest level,

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:12.760
and even at lower
levels, somebody

00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:15.010
does something that you
don't think they do.

00:46:15.010 --> 00:46:18.530
They might have that one day
where they hit a purple patch.

00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:21.790
But in general, if
you have a thought

00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:23.660
that they don't do
something that well,

00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:26.770
it probably will
come to fruition.

00:46:26.770 --> 00:46:28.730
So in a five-minute
warm-up, I even

00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:32.560
told a lady not too long ago
in a-- she's a 4.0 player.

00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:35.675
You know what 4.0 player is?

00:46:35.675 --> 00:46:37.300
Because she was
telling me how much she

00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:38.900
gets nervous all the time.

00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:40.860
And I say, believe
it or not, your feet

00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:42.850
are completely
connected to your brain,

00:46:42.850 --> 00:46:45.410
and the first thing when
you get nervous is your feet

00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:47.750
start to go, and you
make bad decisions.

00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:50.750
So you get the happy
feet, get on your feet,

00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:53.270
and just think about-- maybe
hum a song in your head,

00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:55.940
but just tell yourself what
you think their weakness is

00:46:55.940 --> 00:46:57.611
and find that.

00:46:57.611 --> 00:47:01.574
Find the weakness, whatever
it is that you think it is.

00:47:01.574 --> 00:47:02.990
And in the warm-up,
like you said,

00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:05.560
if you don't know a player,
hit every ball to one side

00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:07.989
to find out what side and
how do they react to that?

00:47:07.989 --> 00:47:09.530
STEVE JAMISON: What's
a purple patch?

00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:10.490
BRAD GILBERT: A purple patch?

00:47:10.490 --> 00:47:11.270
You don't know what
a purple patch is?

00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:12.425
STEVE JAMISON: I have
not heard that phrase.

00:47:12.425 --> 00:47:14.339
Do you know what
a purple patch is?

00:47:14.339 --> 00:47:14.880
AUDIENCE: No.

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:15.740
STEVE JAMISON: What
is a purple patch?

00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:17.070
You said "hit a purple patch."

00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:18.100
AUDIENCE: It sounds
like a bruise.

00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:18.975
BRAD GILBERT: No, no.

00:47:18.975 --> 00:47:23.250
Actually, it's an English
term when you're in fuego.

00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:24.080
You're on fire.

00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:25.399
You can't miss.

00:47:25.399 --> 00:47:26.440
STEVE JAMISON: All right.

00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:28.231
BRAD GILBERT: I didn't
get that that often,

00:47:28.231 --> 00:47:31.324
but I've heard it
in cricket, too.

00:47:31.324 --> 00:47:32.990
STEVE JAMISON: So
it's like in the zone.

00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:34.030
You get in the zone.

00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:36.091
Purple patch.

00:47:36.091 --> 00:47:38.340
AUDIENCE: I believe you
coached Roddick at some point.

00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:39.000
Is that correct?

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:39.750
BRAD GILBERT: I did, yes.

00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:40.291
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:47:40.291 --> 00:47:42.090
So this question's
about Roddick.

00:47:42.090 --> 00:47:44.940
So number one, I wanted to know
what your favorite coaching

00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:47.030
moment was for with Roddick.

00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:50.840
And number two, I wanted
to ask you your opinion why

00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:52.790
that second Grand
Slam for Roddick

00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:59.160
was so elusive outside of
Federer competing with him?

00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:01.190
BRAD GILBERT: My
favorite Roddick moment,

00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:09.490
believe it or not, was
the first day on the job.

00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:14.330
Well, first, when
he called the house,

00:48:14.330 --> 00:48:17.890
Zoe wa-- so this was the-- god,
I'm getting old-- 12 years ago.

00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:19.750
Zoe was seven.

00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:21.500
No, five.

00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:22.600
Zoe was five.

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:24.910
He called the house, and
this is Andy Roddick.

00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:26.970
Can I speak to your dad?

00:48:26.970 --> 00:48:28.680
And she goes, he's
in the garden,

00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:31.960
and she just hung up on him.

00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:36.120
Zoe hung up on him
twice until she actually

00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:39.512
went outside and told Kim that
some guy called a couple times,

00:48:39.512 --> 00:48:41.720
and I was like, yeah, maybe
I want to take that call.

00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:45.160
So I got on a plane
literally the next day

00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:49.010
to start coaching Andy
at Queens in 2003.

00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:54.530
And to that point, he had
never won a match on grass.

00:48:54.530 --> 00:49:01.730
And he told me that Queens
and Wimbledon was a throwaway,

00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:05.810
that when we get to the hard
court in the States, then

00:49:05.810 --> 00:49:07.110
you could see what I can do.

00:49:07.110 --> 00:49:08.870
I was kind of
scratching my head.

00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:10.370
I was like, I don't understand.

00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:12.706
You serve huge.

00:49:12.706 --> 00:49:14.080
You're going to
be fine on grass.

00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:14.580
He goes, no.

00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:17.420
I've never won a match on grass.

00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:19.510
We'll wait until we
get to-- he was already

00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:23.040
talking about Indianapolis,
which was seven weeks away,

00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:25.980
and I'm really struggling
to understand this concept

00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:27.470
that you're focusing
on seven weeks

00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:30.880
away when we're three days
away from the start of Queens.

00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:33.101
And I'm like, you know what?

00:49:33.101 --> 00:49:34.600
You're going to win
this tournament,

00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:36.260
and you're going
to show yourself

00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:37.840
that you can play on grass.

00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:38.840
He says, no, no, no.

00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:41.230
I don't win matches on grass.

00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:45.403
So sure enough, that
tournament, he beat three guys

00:49:45.403 --> 00:49:48.710
that he had never beaten before,
and he won that tournament

00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:49.270
at Queens.

00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:51.440
And then at the end
of the tournament,

00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:56.770
he says, well, Indianapolis
can wait now a little bit.

00:49:56.770 --> 00:49:59.320
So that was actually my
favorite Roddick moment

00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:03.800
that I got him believing that
if you're a tennis player,

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:05.300
you're going to be
good on anything,

00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:07.220
but if you believe
that you're not,

00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:09.262
it will affect you incredibly.

00:50:09.262 --> 00:50:11.470
STEVE JAMISON: You played
tennis, you coached tennis,

00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:13.930
you do great coverage on tennis.

00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:16.940
Which do you like best?

00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:20.050
BRAD GILBERT: I'd like
to think of-- I'm 53.

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:22.420
I'm almost 54 years old.

00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:25.850
I'm still a long ways
from figuring it out.

00:50:25.850 --> 00:50:28.490
I enjoy that in my
entire adult life,

00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:31.520
that I've got to do tennis,
and I'm still learning.

00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:33.110
I love all aspects.

00:50:33.110 --> 00:50:35.050
I can't go back to playing.

00:50:35.050 --> 00:50:38.340
I play all the time, but
I'm not the same guy.

00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:41.390
So obviously, now I love
coaching, I love doing TV,

00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:44.530
but more than anything, I
just enjoy the chance to do

00:50:44.530 --> 00:50:46.190
something that I really enjoy.

00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:47.856
STEVE JAMISON: Who
are you coaching now?

00:50:47.856 --> 00:50:50.874
Do you do it on an ad hoc basis?

00:50:50.874 --> 00:50:53.040
BRAD GILBERT: Mrs. G over
there, Kim Gilbert, people

00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:56.829
email her all the time, and I
work with different players.

00:50:56.829 --> 00:50:58.870
STEVE JAMISON: Would you
work with a hacker, just

00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:59.770
a 4.0 player?

00:50:59.770 --> 00:51:04.300
If they said I'd like a
lesson, what would you charge?

00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:08.050
BRAD GILBERT: Believe it
or not, I do it a lot.

00:51:08.050 --> 00:51:13.110
So often, people will
write back a letter to Kim

00:51:13.110 --> 00:51:15.620
because she makes it
all happen, and they

00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:18.072
can't believe that
when I'm on the court

00:51:18.072 --> 00:51:19.780
that I'm going to give
them the same love

00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:22.290
and intensity as anybody.

00:51:22.290 --> 00:51:25.000
And my whole goal is
if I'm on the court--

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.082
a lot of people,
husbands or wives,

00:51:27.082 --> 00:51:28.415
they get gifts for their spouse.

00:51:31.690 --> 00:51:32.440
The coolest thing.

00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:33.620
I just was on the court.

00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:38.830
A guy works-- Dan Simon, he's
the CNN guy for San Francisco,

00:51:38.830 --> 00:51:41.170
and his wife got him
the birthday gift.

00:51:41.170 --> 00:51:42.810
I'm on the court,
and he can't believe

00:51:42.810 --> 00:51:46.900
that I'm actually working on
his game and spending the time.

00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:49.130
And it's like I'm on
the court with somebody,

00:51:49.130 --> 00:51:54.090
I'm going to try to help you
and try to understand your game.

00:51:54.090 --> 00:51:57.990
The one thing that I
learned from coaching,

00:51:57.990 --> 00:52:01.290
when I was coaching Roddick,
I'm not coaching Agassi.

00:52:01.290 --> 00:52:04.016
When I'm coaching Andy Murray,
I'm coaching Andy Murray.

00:52:04.016 --> 00:52:05.640
So when I'm on the
court with somebody,

00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:07.200
I'm not thinking
about somebody else.

00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:10.120
I'm thinking about what we
can do to look at their game

00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:11.000
to improve.

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.160
So I did this thing
yesterday for Har-Tru

00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:18.600
and a lady named Kim, and
she was holding a racket down

00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:19.517
at her waist.

00:52:19.517 --> 00:52:21.850
And I'm like, you've got to
protect your Will and Grace.

00:52:21.850 --> 00:52:23.020
You've got to put
the racket in front

00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:24.410
of your nose a
little bit, and so we

00:52:24.410 --> 00:52:25.535
were working on her volley.

00:52:25.535 --> 00:52:26.780
She had never been told that.

00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:29.840
So we did a little thing
working on holding a racket.

00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:32.190
Sp I always feel like
there's something

00:52:32.190 --> 00:52:35.090
we can work on, something that
we can help them get better.

00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:37.590
And I enjoy that process
as much as anything,

00:52:37.590 --> 00:52:39.780
trying to help
people get better.

00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:42.410
STEVE JAMISON: I know you like
to teach, which is coaching,

00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:46.850
but you have this
amazing fascination

00:52:46.850 --> 00:52:48.529
with how the game works.

00:52:48.529 --> 00:52:51.070
That's why you were saying-- I
didn't know you liked cricket.

00:52:51.070 --> 00:52:52.240
BRAD GILBERT: I love cricket.

00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:53.823
STEVE JAMISON: But
whatever the sport,

00:52:53.823 --> 00:52:55.690
you view it like a
watchmaker views a watch.

00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:59.250
You just love the dynamics
of it and the mechanics of it

00:52:59.250 --> 00:53:00.630
and everything about it.

00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:03.320
BRAD GILBERT: I'm
not pseudotechnical.

00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:05.009
There are some
coaches in some sports

00:53:05.009 --> 00:53:06.050
that are super technical.

00:53:06.050 --> 00:53:08.880
And one of my all
time pet peeves

00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:12.280
is hearing a coach that
has one philosophy--

00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:14.990
it's my way or the highway--
and he's not adaptable.

00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:18.389
To me, I'm adaptable
to the player.

00:53:18.389 --> 00:53:19.930
I mean, if you have
a system, but you

00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:22.800
don't have any players
that can play the system,

00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:24.810
you're in a lot of trouble.

00:53:24.810 --> 00:53:28.750
So I like to think
of whatever sport

00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:31.410
it is, I start thinking to
myself, if I was playing

00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:32.660
that sport, how would I do it?

00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:35.170
What would be my niche in it?

00:53:35.170 --> 00:53:37.480
I like that facet of sports.

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:39.070
STEVE JAMISON: I know that.

00:53:39.070 --> 00:53:41.110
AUDIENCE: At the end
of Agassi's career,

00:53:41.110 --> 00:53:43.750
his knees were a
little shot, I think.

00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:45.330
BRAD GILBERT: No, his hips.

00:53:45.330 --> 00:53:47.320
AUDIENCE: Was it his hips?

00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:48.914
Well, you hear about
Nadal and people

00:53:48.914 --> 00:53:50.330
with all kinds of
health problems.

00:53:50.330 --> 00:53:54.399
Federer on the other hand,
like you said, amazing health.

00:53:54.399 --> 00:53:55.940
He's obviously doing
something right.

00:53:58.630 --> 00:54:00.380
Are people learning
lessons from Federer

00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:04.280
or learning how to keep
themselves healthy better

00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:05.640
as time goes on?

00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:08.680
BRAD GILBERT: It's a
great question in sports.

00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:12.580
There's more done now on
research and everything.

00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:16.950
But there's no
foolproof way that you

00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:19.790
can keep yourself healthy
when you're pushing yourself

00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:21.330
to the limit.

00:54:21.330 --> 00:54:26.610
I do think for some
reason with Roger,

00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:30.489
I told you his socks don't get
dirty, but believe it or not,

00:54:30.489 --> 00:54:32.530
I had a pair of his shoes
last year at Wimbledon.

00:54:32.530 --> 00:54:35.110
We had them on set,
and me being crazy,

00:54:35.110 --> 00:54:37.460
I started looking
at his shoes, and I

00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:39.620
noticed something incredible.

00:54:39.620 --> 00:54:44.300
He has all-time Fred
Flintstone feet.

00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:45.540
STEVE JAMISON: Which is what?

00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:47.326
BRAD GILBERT: His
shoe size-- well, he's

00:54:47.326 --> 00:54:52.570
got a 12 for his size,
but he had a quadruple E.

00:54:52.570 --> 00:54:55.645
He's got the widest, thickest
feet you've ever seen,

00:54:55.645 --> 00:54:56.520
like Fred Flintstone.

00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:58.376
Maybe that's why he's got this--

00:54:58.376 --> 00:54:59.500
STEVE JAMISON: It's a base.

00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:01.125
BRAD GILBERT: Nothing
else is that big,

00:55:01.125 --> 00:55:04.119
but he's got these
massive, wide, thick feet.

00:55:04.119 --> 00:55:05.910
So maybe that's why
he's got the good base.

00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:09.670
But there is no
foolproof science.

00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:11.420
You're hearing these
football players that

00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:16.360
sleep in hyperbaric chambers,
and you do all this stuff

00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:17.570
to prevent injuries.

00:55:17.570 --> 00:55:20.455
Some of it is luck,
some of it's your DNA.

00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:26.110
Roger, the one thing that he
does maybe an amazing job,

00:55:26.110 --> 00:55:29.650
he paces his schedule.

00:55:29.650 --> 00:55:31.400
When he thinks he's
going to play a block,

00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:34.020
he plays that block,
doesn't change from it,

00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:37.430
and then goes from when
it's time to train.

00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:42.650
Nadal's style, it's
like a running back.

00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:44.640
It's like you see
him and you think,

00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:47.550
it takes more physical
exertion the way he plays.

00:55:47.550 --> 00:55:49.540
You see Nadal when he's playing.

00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:55.140
He's in a full lather
sweat five minutes in.

00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:59.470
So part of it's your
DNA, too, but to tell you

00:55:59.470 --> 00:56:03.840
that somebody has some
magic formula how you're not

00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:06.260
going to get hurt, a lot
of football teams who spend

00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:08.010
zillions, basketball
teams, baseball teams

00:56:08.010 --> 00:56:10.120
spend zillions to keep
their guys healthy,

00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:11.680
and they want to know why.

00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:15.130
Sometimes it really is, I swear
to god, this ugly word to say,

00:56:15.130 --> 00:56:16.157
it's luck.

00:56:16.157 --> 00:56:17.990
STEVE JAMISON: You
mentioned football teams.

00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:20.930
Is it true the 49ers are
doomed this coming season?

00:56:23.285 --> 00:56:24.910
Or would you rather
talk about Oakland?

00:56:27.746 --> 00:56:29.496
BRAD GILBERT: We are
in 49er country here.

00:56:29.496 --> 00:56:30.670
STEVE JAMISON: I know it.

00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:32.182
Give us some good news.

00:56:32.182 --> 00:56:33.390
BRAD GILBERT: Some good news.

00:56:33.390 --> 00:56:36.450
OK, I'll be the eternal
optimist that they got rid

00:56:36.450 --> 00:56:40.770
of a coach that was an
unbelievable gift for them,

00:56:40.770 --> 00:56:43.500
and they replaced
him with an unknown.

00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:45.970
But you know what?

00:56:45.970 --> 00:56:48.980
Now it's time for the players
and time for everybody

00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:51.710
to figure out that
you know what?

00:56:51.710 --> 00:56:53.620
Everybody's selling us short.

00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:55.910
No one thinks we
can do anything.

00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:57.760
So instead of
having that attitude

00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:00.622
that we're going down--
they call it in Australia

00:57:00.622 --> 00:57:01.330
down the gurgler.

00:57:01.330 --> 00:57:02.370
You're going down the tubes.

00:57:02.370 --> 00:57:03.161
That you know what?

00:57:03.161 --> 00:57:06.390
We have a chance to make
things happen and get better.

00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:09.780
And so don't buy into that
we're going down the gurgler.

00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:12.510
STEVE JAMISON: That's not a
very optimistic message, Brad.

00:57:12.510 --> 00:57:14.510
BRAD GILBERT: Vegas has
it that their over/under

00:57:14.510 --> 00:57:16.351
win total is about six.

00:57:16.351 --> 00:57:17.100
STEVE JAMISON: OK.

00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:19.110
I don't know what that
means, but is that good?

00:57:19.110 --> 00:57:20.610
BRAD GILBERT: You
know what that is?

00:57:20.610 --> 00:57:22.190
That's at 6 and 10.

00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:22.940
STEVE JAMISON: OK.

00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:25.554
That's our optimistic
message about the 49ers.

00:57:25.554 --> 00:57:27.970
BRAD GILBERT: That's better
than they have for the Raiders

00:57:27.970 --> 00:57:28.640
at four and a half.

00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:29.330
STEVE JAMISON: OK.

00:57:29.330 --> 00:57:30.020
BRAD GILBERT: Right here.

00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:30.480
AUDIENCE: Hi, Brad.

00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:31.979
My name is Kishore
and this question

00:57:31.979 --> 00:57:34.580
is from my brother's
son, who is 13 and 1/2

00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:38.040
and is playing under 14 within
the top 100 in the country

00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:38.640
right now.

00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:42.110
So his question is I think
he's at a crossroads.

00:57:42.110 --> 00:57:43.880
He feels he's at a
crossroads because he's

00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:46.520
getting into high
school and spending

00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:49.620
I think around four days
a week practicing tennis

00:57:49.620 --> 00:57:51.860
in the evenings and
paying tournaments

00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:54.702
in weekends at the same time the
academic pressure is coming in.

00:57:54.702 --> 00:57:56.410
And if he doesn't play
those tournaments,

00:57:56.410 --> 00:57:59.100
he's going to fall behind in
rankings, and the pressure

00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:01.090
of having to come back up.

00:58:01.090 --> 00:58:04.340
So the question
is, I'm sure this

00:58:04.340 --> 00:58:07.760
is common for a lot of people,
and you kind of touched upon

00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:09.450
that earlier.

00:58:09.450 --> 00:58:11.805
So what is your advice
to somebody like this?

00:58:11.805 --> 00:58:13.930
BRAD GILBERT: First of all,
I thought at about nine

00:58:13.930 --> 00:58:17.100
we end the halves because it
was always like the 7 and 1/2,

00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:20.110
8 and 1/2, but 13
and 1/2, I like that.

00:58:20.110 --> 00:58:27.500
There is no such thing in life
at 13 and 1/2 as a crossroads.

00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:30.920
Honest to god, I would tell
you that's alarming in itself

00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:33.570
to hear the stress
of somebody saying

00:58:33.570 --> 00:58:35.840
that I'm at a crossroads.

00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:40.540
Tennis is a game that you can
play for the rest of your life.

00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:41.950
And you know what?

00:58:41.950 --> 00:58:45.040
It's a vehicle that can
help you in everything.

00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:47.210
But that's the very first
thing that I would say.

00:58:47.210 --> 00:58:48.960
You're not at a crossroads.

00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:50.520
Don't think of it
as a crossroads.

00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:52.480
What do you want to accomplish?

00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:54.770
What do we want to
do and get better at?

00:58:54.770 --> 00:58:56.530
What's our goal for high school?

00:58:56.530 --> 00:59:01.670
Maybe if I'm stressing
playing the tournaments

00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:04.160
on the weekends, maybe we
can invest a little more time

00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:07.380
and maybe less time
playing tournaments,

00:59:07.380 --> 00:59:09.640
or figure out a
different schedule,

00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:11.460
but take out that crossroads.

00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:14.285
That's a bullshit
word for a 13 and 1/2

00:59:14.285 --> 00:59:17.940
year old because that's
only putting more pressure,

00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:22.740
and it's setting
himself up for a fall.

00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:26.330
At 13 and 1/2, there's no
reason to have any type of fall.

00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:27.490
Life is fun.

00:59:27.490 --> 00:59:31.390
It gets hard when you're an
adult, but at 13 and 1/2,

00:59:31.390 --> 00:59:32.220
life is fun.

00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:35.070
You shouldn't feel any
stress or pressure.

00:59:35.070 --> 00:59:37.930
And I do see it
more now than ever,

00:59:37.930 --> 00:59:40.700
and I see it more now from
parents stressing kids

00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:44.770
that they have to be at
this level of expectations

00:59:44.770 --> 00:59:45.960
that they want.

00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:49.880
The first thing when I do coach
a kid, I always want to know,

00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:51.810
does he want to be good
because he wants it,

00:59:51.810 --> 00:59:54.018
not because his parents or
not because somebody else.

00:59:54.018 --> 00:59:56.230
So I want to know that the
passion comes from him,

00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:57.710
and we work with that.

00:59:57.710 --> 01:00:00.520
That's the most important
thing is finding out

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:03.890
how passionate he is and
where is it coming from,

01:00:03.890 --> 01:00:07.520
and talk about the
positives, and no crossroads.

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:10.800
That's not a word
for a kid whatsoever.

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:16.050
STEVE JAMISON: When you're doing
worldwide ESPN coverage live,

01:00:16.050 --> 01:00:19.375
have you ever slipped like
that and used a bad word?

01:00:19.375 --> 01:00:24.430
A curse word like you just did?

01:00:24.430 --> 01:00:25.070
No?

01:00:25.070 --> 01:00:25.890
BRAD GILBERT: I
have not got called

01:00:25.890 --> 01:00:26.830
in the principal's office.

01:00:26.830 --> 01:00:27.910
STEVE JAMISON: That's
all we need to know.

01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:29.080
That's all we need to know.

01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:32.810
BRAD GILBERT: I think,
though, in December

01:00:32.810 --> 01:00:37.160
when I did seven
weeks of radio, they

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:39.720
have a 3-second
delay for the live.

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:45.170
I think I popped a 3-second
delay, but I'm pretty good.

01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:47.810
I sometimes bite
my tongue if I'm

01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:49.060
going to say something stupid.

01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:49.870
STEVE JAMISON:
Didn't you tell me

01:00:49.870 --> 01:00:51.810
that they want you to
stay just basically

01:00:51.810 --> 01:00:53.184
like you are, and
they don't even

01:00:53.184 --> 01:00:55.340
call you in for the
precoverage meetings

01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:56.999
and say, do this,
do this, do this.

01:00:56.999 --> 01:00:58.290
BRAD GILBERT: I go to meetings.

01:00:58.290 --> 01:00:59.290
STEVE JAMISON: Do you?

01:00:59.290 --> 01:01:00.990
BRAD GILBERT: One
thing about TV--

01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:01.470
STEVE JAMISON: You
go to meetings.

01:01:01.470 --> 01:01:02.530
BRAD GILBERT: --there's
a lot of meetings.

01:01:02.530 --> 01:01:03.371
STEVE JAMISON: OK.

01:01:03.371 --> 01:01:05.870
BRAD GILBERT: There's a lot
more meetings and stuff going on

01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:07.190
than you'd ever think.

01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:09.530
But I've never studied
myself, I never

01:01:09.530 --> 01:01:11.200
went to seminars or
whatever, and they

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:14.600
do want me to be myself and
not try to overthink it.

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:18.020
I think about when I'm
on air, the one thing

01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:20.950
is it's like talking
on a telephone.

01:01:20.950 --> 01:01:22.870
I tell you what, speak
of the telephone,

01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:24.917
young people don't
even have a land line.

01:01:24.917 --> 01:01:26.500
You ask people,
what's your land line?

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:27.000
Excuse me?

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.220
Everybody's got a cellphone.

01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:29.489
That's it.

01:01:29.489 --> 01:01:30.780
So that's how I think about it.

01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:33.670
I don't get nervous I
don't overanalyze it.

01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:34.910
I don't stress it.

01:01:34.910 --> 01:01:35.900
I just try to enjoy it.

01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:36.950
STEVE JAMISON: You've
been good from the start,

01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:39.830
although I think Kim Gilbert has
got you looking a lot better.

01:01:39.830 --> 01:01:41.050
BRAD GILBERT: Kim Gilbert
picks out all my clothes.

01:01:41.050 --> 01:01:42.750
STEVE JAMISON:
You're looking good.

01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:44.350
AUDIENCE: I'm glad you could
make it down here, Brad.

01:01:44.350 --> 01:01:46.766
I've been waiting to see you
down here for a couple years.

01:01:46.766 --> 01:01:48.900
But given that you have
a good mind for tennis

01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:51.450
and you evaluate talent
pretty well, when

01:01:51.450 --> 01:01:54.625
the so-called big four in
the men's game is gone,

01:01:54.625 --> 01:01:58.360
who do you see as maybe the
next dominant male player

01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:00.291
on the horizon?

01:02:00.291 --> 01:02:01.790
BRAD GILBERT: It's
a great question.

01:02:01.790 --> 01:02:05.501
You know, if you'd asked
me after Andre and Pete,

01:02:05.501 --> 01:02:07.000
I would have told
you there's no way

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.900
that we were going to have a
dominant player right away.

01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:11.316
I would have thought
we might have

01:02:11.316 --> 01:02:14.390
had a five-year period where
it would have been a push

01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:16.590
and pull that maybe a
few different guys would

01:02:16.590 --> 01:02:18.640
make a move maybe.

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:21.630
But obviously, it
changed, immediately how

01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:25.410
dominant Fed came, and then
outrageously then came Nadal,

01:02:25.410 --> 01:02:29.360
and now we're going
through it with Djocovic.

01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:34.750
I think we have some incredible
teenagers, but like I said,

01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:39.360
I think Coric, I think Kyrgios
have incredible talent.

01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:42.050
I'm hopeful the
American, Francis Tiafoe.

01:02:42.050 --> 01:02:44.280
There's another
Australian, Kokkinakis.

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:46.410
There's another
German named Zverev.

01:02:46.410 --> 01:02:50.800
But to say that somebody
winning one or a few to becoming

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:53.810
a dominant one is a
whole other animal,

01:02:53.810 --> 01:02:56.140
and there hasn't been
that many, so I don't like

01:02:56.140 --> 01:02:58.600
to put that label on somebody.

01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:01.600
If you ask me and say, OK,
this guy's got a chance

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:06.060
to be a great player, but to be
the next Nadal, the next Fed,

01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:08.200
that's a big label
to put on somebody.

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:10.050
And what happens to
a lot of players--

01:03:10.050 --> 01:03:12.010
I told this to our
Canada friend--

01:03:12.010 --> 01:03:18.120
and what happens is expectations
on young players sometimes

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:20.370
can just wear them down.

01:03:20.370 --> 01:03:25.500
And some have the ability to
take expectations and embrace

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:28.570
it like nobody and they
actually get better for it

01:03:28.570 --> 01:03:31.620
because they like it.

01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:36.280
To me, how I define absolute
greatness, when somebody says,

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:37.320
how do you see it?

01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:39.480
How you know it?

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:41.870
When I watch a
Michael Jordan, when

01:03:41.870 --> 01:03:48.560
I watch a Kobe, when I
watch a Fed, Nadal, a Tom

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:56.250
Brady, at the highest level,
when other people will say

01:03:56.250 --> 01:03:59.870
things are going a million
miles an hour, for them,

01:03:59.870 --> 01:04:06.000
it actually slows down to where
it actually becomes absolutely

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.960
clear what they're going to do.

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:12.130
And that is the 0000%.

01:04:12.130 --> 01:04:14.140
You need obviously the
genius athleticism,

01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:20.170
but those are the
athletic prowess, to me.

01:04:20.170 --> 01:04:23.040
When it's 100 all
on a basketball game

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:27.310
and Michael Jordan's clear
at what he's going to do,

01:04:27.310 --> 01:04:28.880
that is so rare.

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:30.290
That's what you see from Fed.

01:04:30.290 --> 01:04:32.050
That, to me, is
the clearest thing

01:04:32.050 --> 01:04:34.100
that I've ever
seen of greatness,

01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:37.550
that things slow down for them
for the same other person that

01:04:37.550 --> 01:04:40.180
maybe is close in
talent, that it speeds up

01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:42.266
and they make a bad decision.

01:04:42.266 --> 01:04:43.390
STEVE JAMISON: That's good.

01:04:43.390 --> 01:04:44.870
I'll just close with this.

01:04:44.870 --> 01:04:49.490
I interviewed you right after
you teamed up with Andre.

01:04:49.490 --> 01:04:51.440
He was 28 or 29,
as you mentioned.

01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:54.920
I said, can you get Andre
to number one in the world?

01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:57.580
And you said, I can
get him to number two.

01:04:57.580 --> 01:04:59.490
After that, it's up to Andre.

01:04:59.490 --> 01:05:01.380
And it goes to something inside.

01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:03.687
There's an intangible
at that highest level

01:05:03.687 --> 01:05:05.520
that you can get them
here, but then they've

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:09.290
got to get to that final
rung on the ladder.

01:05:09.290 --> 01:05:11.040
BRAD GILBERT: I've
seen in a lot of sports

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:16.390
that athletically
or skill set wise,

01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:19.580
they have it to get to
where you think you can,

01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:24.060
but then there's a lot
of things sometimes

01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:28.580
that that last step is more
than a lot of different things

01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:31.220
and how you handle all that.

01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:35.960
Sometimes that one step is a
lot bigger than one step, man.

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:37.970
It's like football fields.

01:05:37.970 --> 01:05:40.250
STEVE JAMISON: You had a
great career as a player

01:05:40.250 --> 01:05:42.340
with one exception.

01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:46.059
Lendl beat you 19 times
in a row and you told me--

01:05:46.059 --> 01:05:47.850
BRAD GILBERT: Why you
got to make it worse?

01:05:47.850 --> 01:05:48.550
It was only 16.

01:05:48.550 --> 01:05:49.490
STEVE JAMISON: 16.

01:05:49.490 --> 01:05:49.989
OK.

01:05:49.989 --> 01:05:52.195
He beat you 16 times in a
row, and you were so mad

01:05:52.195 --> 01:05:55.260
that you didn't get a chance
to play him for the 17th time.

01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:56.990
Why was that?

01:05:56.990 --> 01:06:00.460
BRAD GILBERT: The 16th
time I'm playing him,

01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:05.220
I'm at Philly at the
old Spectrum Arena,

01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:08.039
and every time I
played him, I always

01:06:08.039 --> 01:06:09.080
felt like Freddy Krueger.

01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:12.590
I mean, the guy just
could not be killed.

01:06:12.590 --> 01:06:15.740
The first 10 times,
he just waxed me.

01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:23.200
But for some reason, this
was in '91 in Philly.

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:26.320
I had this feeling for
the first time walking out

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:29.165
I wasn't uptight, actually
had a sense of calmness.

01:06:29.165 --> 01:06:31.540
And I said to myself for the
first time-- I couldn't even

01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:32.706
believe I said it to myself.

01:06:32.706 --> 01:06:37.070
I was like, I'm going to beat
this-- I said a bad word.

01:06:37.070 --> 01:06:40.119
I'm going to beat
this guy tonight.

01:06:40.119 --> 01:06:42.160
And for the first time,
things were slowing down,

01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:46.500
and I actually felt really
good about my chances.

01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:50.740
Little did I know in the second
set, somehow I rolled my foot,

01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:52.750
and it was killing me.

01:06:52.750 --> 01:06:57.300
I knew that somehow, I've
got to get through this.

01:06:57.300 --> 01:07:01.060
I was up 4-1, double
break in the third.

01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:04.830
I got a game point,
and I really started

01:07:04.830 --> 01:07:08.540
thinking about all
the times that he

01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:11.580
had given me a lot of
grief in the locker room.

01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:12.395
That's it.

01:07:12.395 --> 01:07:14.020
I'm going to be able
to shake his hand,

01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:15.110
and say I finally got him.

01:07:15.110 --> 01:07:17.180
And so I got ahead of
myself a little bit.

01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:21.500
I choked the easiest volley
on top of the net for 5-1

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:22.550
in the third.

01:07:22.550 --> 01:07:24.940
I go on to lose
7-5 in the third.

01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:27.680
I'm sitting in the locker
room with three bags

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:28.580
of ice on my foot.

01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:30.240
I ended up being
out about 10 weeks.

01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:32.890
I had a little stress
fracture on my foot.

01:07:32.890 --> 01:07:39.680
Lendl comes over with his
normal Lendl sense of humor

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:42.940
and he said to me, if
I had 110 temperature,

01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:48.090
and I was on my deathbed, I
wasn't losing to you tonight.

01:07:48.090 --> 01:07:49.612
STEVE JAMISON: Thank you, Brad.

01:07:49.612 --> 01:07:50.820
BRAD GILBERT: Got to love it.

01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:52.370
