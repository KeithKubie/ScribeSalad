00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.290
Here is our example class again.

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.650
Now let's look at the middle compartment which is for purposes of

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:11.480
describing attributes. You'll see that there are different attributes described.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.950
All of them have names. They have types. And they may have some other symbols

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:22.110
that described how the names can be accessed from other classes. Those symbols,

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.980
describe the visibility of that name. They're optional you don't have to provide

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.080
them and there's no reason, at the start, to do that. They're a refinement that

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:38.570
you add later on in the process. The four options in UML for visibility include.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.880
Publicly visible that's a plus sign. Private, which is a minus sign.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.780
Protect meaning that only sub-classes can access that attribute

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.990
is the pound sign. And for those situations where you used UML

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.960
packages that tilde indicates that the name is visible within the package.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.230
In addition to the visibility of course you must have the name of the attribute.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.685
You can indicate the multiplicity of ordering of the attribute.

00:01:10.685 --> 00:01:16.119
Now they're not shown in this example, but we'll see them later. You should give

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:23.320
the type of the attribute. And UML has a set of built in types that you can use.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.200
You can optionally describe an initial value for that particular instance

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.980
variable. You could indicate that the instance variable is derived.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.950
That is it's computed rather than being set directly. And you can give some

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.120
additional properties to the instance variable using the the braces

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.050
notation that we mentioned before. For example we can indicate that that

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.250
particular instance variable is frozen. That means its value can't change.
