00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.530
The galaxy far, far, away is getting a lot
bigger in the coming years, which means plenty

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.040
of writers, directors and actors each getting
a chance to throw in nods to the original

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.020
films. But even though the Star Wars saga
has been pored over for decades, there are

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.860
still a TON of details, secrets and easter
eggs we're willing to bet fans have never

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:34.550
caught. Here are Screen Rant's 10 Hidden Details
In Star Wars Films.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:35.790
No Ordinary Freighter

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.850
George Lucas knew that the Millennium Falcon
was as iconic as anything else in his original

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.800
trilogy, so when it came time to flesh out
the world of Naboo in Attack of the Clones,

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.579
he didn't disappoint. Fans can spot not one,
but&nbsp;three&nbsp;Corellian YT-1300 light freighters

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.090
in Naboo's spaceport. It's apparently a more
popular model than you'd think, but in the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.739
following movie, fans can catch the real Falcon
landing on Coruscant, years before Han Solo

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.530
would ever get behind the wheel.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.530
Lucky Charms

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.120
The tradition may have started during World
War II, but these days, hanging a pair of

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.640
fuzzy dice from a car's rearview mirror doesn't
need to be explained. Apparently, even Han

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.780
Solo and Chewbacca can use the added luck,
including a pair of gold dice hanging in the

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.710
cockpit of the Millenium Falcon. They're hard
to spot, but the die-hard fans know where

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.380
to look. In fact, The Force Awakens was already
filming by the time a crew member realized

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.540
the dice were missing, buying a gold plated
pair on eBay. Talk about commitment to continuity.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.420
A Rebel Painter

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.750
George Lucas may have dreamed up one incredible
space opera all by himself, but it was Ralph

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.909
McQuarrie's concept paintings (use Still Images)
which made the director's vision a reality,

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.320
and convinced Fox that it was worth investing
in. McQuarrie's role wasn't lost on Lucas

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.899
either: when it came time to film The Empire
Strikes Back, he made sure to give the painter

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:50.590
a cameo, strutting through Hoth's Echo Base
- with his sketchpad in hand, obviously.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:51.590
Late Ejection

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.280
The Star Wars series is filled with space
battles and exploding space stations, but

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.340
the movies usually show nothing but sparks
and smoke to keep violence to a minimum. But

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.009
one shot shows the model builders have a sense
of humor. When the Millennium Falcon enters

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:08.220
an asteroid field in Episode V, one pursuing
TIE Fighter crashes directly into a space

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.900
rock. But don't miss the unlucky pilot sent
helplessly ragdoll-ing out of the wreckage,

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.020
visible for a split second before being broken
into pieces.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.269
Boba Fett Unmasked

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.280
When Luke's friends are used as bait to draw
him to Cloud City, the young Jedi catches

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.290
just a glimpse of them before the trap is
sprung. But when the scene was filmed, the

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.230
actor who was supposed to wrestle Leia out
of the hallway was a no-show. Actor Jeremy

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.819
Bulloch saved the day, taking off his Boba
Fett armor, and throwing on an Imperial uniform.

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.599
It's a rare look at the man who actually played
the part under the Mandalorian's famous helmet,

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.980
but Bulloch got another cameo in Revenge of
the Sith, piloting the Rebel Blockade Runner

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.680
that would kick off the original trilogy.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.680
Squid Lake

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.400
In the world of Star Wars, even an opera is
unrecognizable, shown as a variety of liquid

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.599
spheres in Revenge of the Sith. It's during
a performance of Squid Lake that Anakin first

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.019
learns the power of the Dark Side from Chancellor
Palpatine, taking his first step towards becoming

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.110
Darth Vader. His temptation should have been
obvious, too: when Darth Plagueis is first

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.840
mentioned, the shot cuts to the large sphere
of liquid in front of the men. Look closely

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.430
at the water's reflections, and you'll notice
a ghostly image of Darth Vader's famous helmet.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.549
We give the effects team bonus points for
keeping it subtle, but a cool case of foreshadowing

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.470
all the same.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.400
Skywalker Sound

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.650
Just by making the original Star Wars series,
George Lucas wound up inventing ILM and Skywalker

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.019
Sound, industry-leading studios for special
effects and music. ILM tends to get the most

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.340
headlines, so the director decided to even
the scales, including the logo for Skywalker

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.840
Sound in Attack of The Clones. It's clearly
visible during Anakin and Obi-wan's Coruscant

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.260
chase, rotating as one of a dozen other neon
signs in the entertainment district.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.350
Who Needs Blasters?

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.260
The prequels tend to get a rough ride from
fans, but what if we told you one of the saga's

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.579
greatest moments was hidden in the background
of Revenge of the Sith? Believe it. When Obi-wan

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:55.610
is hunting down General Grievious, clone troopers
are fighting battle droids all around him.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.909
For a split second, one clone trooper can
be seen squaring off against a droid in a

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:04.120
“Rocky-esque” way, dropping it with a
stiff jab to the head, and a brutal body blow.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.799
Hard to spot or not, why this trooper isn't
worshipped as one of the franchise's coolest

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.260
heroes is beyond us - but now's a good time
to start.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.930
Blue in the Face

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.129
Considering how many directors give themselves
cameos in the background of their biggest

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:19.050
blockbusters, you would think George Lucas
would have joined in on the fun at some point.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.840
But the writer and director waited until Revenge
of the Sith to make his triumphant debut,

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.660
painted blue to play the blue-skinned Baron
Papanoida, alongside his daughter, Katie.

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.410
It's a tiny cameo, but both of the characters
ended up getting a lot more screen time in

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.740
the animated Clone Wars - unfortunately, Lucas
didn't reprise his role.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.240
One Tough Youngling

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.530
Anakin's turn to the Dark Side may have been
a long time coming, but he didn't waste time

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.639
becoming evil, slaying the Jedi younglings
on his first mission as Darth Vader. But one

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:47.840
young Jedi ends up standing out, taking on
a handful of clone troopers in front of Bail

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.490
Organa before falling to blaster fire. George
Lucas wasn't happy just giving himself and

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.130
his daughter a cameo - the young boy is his
son, Jett. The character's name is Zett Jukassa,

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.520
and he's no random hero, either: he actually
first appeared in Episode 2 when Obi-wan was

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.550
searching for the planet the killer clones
were grown on.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.860
Those are all the hidden details and easter
eggs we think Star Wars fans will want to

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.060
know, but which ones have we missed? Be sure
