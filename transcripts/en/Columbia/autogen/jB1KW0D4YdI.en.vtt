00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:53.500
we did was to sort of parse this thing a
little more clearly take each of those

00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:53.510
little more clearly take each of those
 

00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:56.349
little more clearly take each of those
eight sections and assign each of them

00:55:56.349 --> 00:55:56.359
eight sections and assign each of them
 

00:55:56.359 --> 00:55:58.569
eight sections and assign each of them
one of those bright magic marker colors

00:55:58.569 --> 00:55:58.579
one of those bright magic marker colors
 

00:55:58.579 --> 00:56:01.630
one of those bright magic marker colors
right so the aid section thing which was

00:56:01.630 --> 00:56:01.640
right so the aid section thing which was
 

00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:04.000
right so the aid section thing which was
sort of the organizing rationale behind

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:04.010
sort of the organizing rationale behind
 

00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:05.380
sort of the organizing rationale behind
the whole book became something we

00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:05.390
the whole book became something we
 

00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:07.420
the whole book became something we
really wanted to spotlight and so then

00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:07.430
really wanted to spotlight and so then
 

00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:08.890
really wanted to spotlight and so then
we thought what we could do then is have

00:56:08.890 --> 00:56:08.900
we thought what we could do then is have
 

00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:10.210
we thought what we could do then is have
a book that kind of had a fairly boring

00:56:10.210 --> 00:56:10.220
a book that kind of had a fairly boring
 

00:56:10.220 --> 00:56:12.609
a book that kind of had a fairly boring
straightforward cover but if we kind of

00:56:12.609 --> 00:56:12.619
straightforward cover but if we kind of
 

00:56:12.619 --> 00:56:14.319
straightforward cover but if we kind of
use those eight colors kind of an

00:56:14.319 --> 00:56:14.329
use those eight colors kind of an
 

00:56:14.329 --> 00:56:16.390
use those eight colors kind of an
amusing way we get this tasty sort of

00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:16.400
amusing way we get this tasty sort of
 

00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:18.910
amusing way we get this tasty sort of
Necco wafer kind of effect and we looked

00:56:18.910 --> 00:56:18.920
Necco wafer kind of effect and we looked
 

00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:20.290
Necco wafer kind of effect and we looked
at the book sideways and that's shown

00:56:20.290 --> 00:56:20.300
at the book sideways and that's shown
 

00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:25.180
at the book sideways and that's shown
there on the left so the basic idea of

00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:25.190
there on the left so the basic idea of
 

00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:27.190
there on the left so the basic idea of
the book was we actually use those

00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:27.200
the book was we actually use those
 

00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:29.559
the book was we actually use those
highlighting colors to highlight things

00:56:29.559 --> 00:56:29.569
highlighting colors to highlight things
 

00:56:29.569 --> 00:56:31.809
highlighting colors to highlight things
just like this and so this is a mock-up

00:56:31.809 --> 00:56:31.819
just like this and so this is a mock-up
 

00:56:31.819 --> 00:56:34.540
just like this and so this is a mock-up
we did early on showing what we intended

00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:34.550
we did early on showing what we intended
 

00:56:34.550 --> 00:56:36.339
we did early on showing what we intended
to do we intended to kind of like them

00:56:36.339 --> 00:56:36.349
to do we intended to kind of like them
 

00:56:36.349 --> 00:56:38.470
to do we intended to kind of like them
pick out the key thoughts from the book

00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:38.480
pick out the key thoughts from the book
 

00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:40.780
pick out the key thoughts from the book
highlight them in the color to that

00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:40.790
highlight them in the color to that
 

00:56:40.790 --> 00:56:42.309
highlight them in the color to that
those thoughts were associated with

00:56:42.309 --> 00:56:42.319
those thoughts were associated with
 

00:56:42.319 --> 00:56:43.720
those thoughts were associated with
whether they were one of those eight

00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:43.730
whether they were one of those eight
 

00:56:43.730 --> 00:56:46.480
whether they were one of those eight
sections and then when we came to the

00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:46.490
sections and then when we came to the
 

00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:50.620
sections and then when we came to the
parts where the themes were illustrated

00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:50.630
parts where the themes were illustrated
 

00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:52.270
parts where the themes were illustrated
with work from the exhibition those

00:56:52.270 --> 00:56:52.280
with work from the exhibition those
 

00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:54.280
with work from the exhibition those
pages were flooded in the colors that

00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:54.290
pages were flooded in the colors that
 

00:56:54.290 --> 00:56:56.349
pages were flooded in the colors that
were associated with their respective

00:56:56.349 --> 00:56:56.359
were associated with their respective
 

00:56:56.359 --> 00:56:58.750
were associated with their respective
sections as well and so this actually

00:56:58.750 --> 00:56:58.760
sections as well and so this actually
 

00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:00.610
sections as well and so this actually
solved number of problem

00:57:00.610 --> 00:57:00.620
solved number of problem
 

00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:02.800
solved number of problem

you know a good photograph and also go

00:57:23.110 --> 00:57:23.120
you know a good photograph and also go
 

00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:24.760
you know a good photograph and also go
to photograph and these and when you're

00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:24.770
to photograph and these and when you're
 

00:57:24.770 --> 00:57:26.200
to photograph and these and when you're
faced with that situation you need to

00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:26.210
faced with that situation you need to
 

00:57:26.210 --> 00:57:30.120

kind of lay down a really nice solid

00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:30.130
kind of lay down a really nice solid
 

00:57:30.130 --> 00:57:32.350
kind of lay down a really nice solid
these things are on the highway they put

00:57:32.350 --> 00:57:32.360
these things are on the highway they put
 

00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:33.820
these things are on the highway they put
a nice net underneath them some none of

00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:33.830
a nice net underneath them some none of
 

00:57:33.830 --> 00:57:35.170
a nice net underneath them some none of
them actually fall off and kill

00:57:35.170 --> 00:57:35.180
them actually fall off and kill
 

00:57:35.180 --> 00:57:37.120
them actually fall off and kill
themselves and so this these color

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:37.130
themselves and so this these color
 

00:57:37.130 --> 00:57:39.010
themselves and so this these color
things became sort of the strong net

00:57:39.010 --> 00:57:39.020
things became sort of the strong net
 

00:57:39.020 --> 00:57:41.590
things became sort of the strong net
that kind of held up all these 134

00:57:41.590 --> 00:57:41.600
that kind of held up all these 134
 

00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:42.850
that kind of held up all these 134
different ways of interpreting things

00:57:42.850 --> 00:57:42.860
different ways of interpreting things
 

00:57:42.860 --> 00:57:46.150
different ways of interpreting things
right and so in doing the book we

00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:46.160
right and so in doing the book we
 

00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:48.400
right and so in doing the book we
created a bunch of sample pages that we

00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:48.410
created a bunch of sample pages that we
 

00:57:48.410 --> 00:57:52.540
created a bunch of sample pages that we
used to test out the idea and to obtain

00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:52.550
used to test out the idea and to obtain
 

00:57:52.550 --> 00:57:54.850
used to test out the idea and to obtain
kind of a go-ahead from the curatorial

00:57:54.850 --> 00:57:54.860
kind of a go-ahead from the curatorial
 

00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:57.160
kind of a go-ahead from the curatorial
team and the publication staff at the

00:57:57.160 --> 00:57:57.170
team and the publication staff at the
 

00:57:57.170 --> 00:57:59.860
team and the publication staff at the
cooper-hewitt these were shown here the

00:57:59.860 --> 00:57:59.870
cooper-hewitt these were shown here the
 

00:57:59.870 --> 00:58:01.540
cooper-hewitt these were shown here the
layout of any of these things is done

00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:01.550
layout of any of these things is done
 

00:58:01.550 --> 00:58:03.700
layout of any of these things is done
almost as you would storyboard a movie

00:58:03.700 --> 00:58:03.710
almost as you would storyboard a movie

think in this form you get to very
clearly see the relationship between

00:58:11.470 --> 00:58:11.480
clearly see the relationship between
 

00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:14.710
clearly see the relationship between
those color thematic versions and how

00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:14.720
those color thematic versions and how
 

00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:16.630
those color thematic versions and how
they progress through page after page of

00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:16.640
they progress through page after page of
 

00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:19.480
they progress through page after page of
the book once we committed to that we

00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:19.490
the book once we committed to that we
 

00:58:19.490 --> 00:58:22.320
the book once we committed to that we
got caught up in this fairly harrowing

00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:22.330
got caught up in this fairly harrowing
 

00:58:22.330 --> 00:58:26.500
got caught up in this fairly harrowing
process of testing those colors because

00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:26.510
process of testing those colors because
 

00:58:26.510 --> 00:58:28.270
process of testing those colors because
the cooper-hewitt couldn't afford and

00:58:28.270 --> 00:58:28.280
the cooper-hewitt couldn't afford and
 

00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:30.430
the cooper-hewitt couldn't afford and
then we wouldn't ask them to afford the

00:58:30.430 --> 00:58:30.440
then we wouldn't ask them to afford the
 

00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:32.500
then we wouldn't ask them to afford the
luxury of printing each of those colors

00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:32.510
luxury of printing each of those colors
 

00:58:32.510 --> 00:58:34.300
luxury of printing each of those colors
as a custom color going through the

you probably know we're actually
compiled from four basic inks black

00:58:44.890 --> 00:58:44.900
compiled from four basic inks black
 

00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:48.190
compiled from four basic inks black
magenta yellow and cyan and so so it was

00:58:48.190 --> 00:58:48.200
magenta yellow and cyan and so so it was
 

00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:50.140
magenta yellow and cyan and so so it was
with these colors too we had these magic

00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:50.150
with these colors too we had these magic
 

00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:51.550
with these colors too we had these magic
marker colors that we like them we had

00:58:51.550 --> 00:58:51.560
marker colors that we like them we had
 

00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:53.680
marker colors that we like them we had
to figure out CMYK values that would

00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:53.690
to figure out CMYK values that would
 

00:58:53.690 --> 00:58:56.200
to figure out CMYK values that would
simulate them closely and even once we

00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:56.210
simulate them closely and even once we
 

00:58:56.210 --> 00:58:58.090
simulate them closely and even once we
did that seeing what would happen when

00:58:58.090 --> 00:58:58.100
did that seeing what would happen when

they hit different kinds of paper was

00:58:59.980 --> 00:58:59.990
they hit different kinds of paper was
 

00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:02.500
they hit different kinds of paper was
always a challenge right and then

00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:02.510
always a challenge right and then
 

00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:04.630
always a challenge right and then
there's a you know shown here working

would appear again

00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:14.480

true because there are so many people

01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:07.230
true because there are so many people
 

01:10:07.230 --> 01:10:09.920
true because there are so many people
out there and even user surveys don't

out there and even user surveys don't
 

01:10:09.930 --> 01:10:12.010
out there and even user surveys don't
tend to surface the truth or they just

01:10:12.010 --> 01:10:12.020
tend to surface the truth or they just
 

01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:14.690
tend to surface the truth or they just
the results are some adamantly ambiguous

the results are some adamantly ambiguous
that is actually frustrating so that's

01:10:16.190 --> 01:10:16.200
that is actually frustrating so that's
 

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:18.350
that is actually frustrating so that's
part of the answer the other part of the

01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:18.360
part of the answer the other part of the
 

01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:19.940
part of the answer the other part of the
answer has to do with purely technical

01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:19.950
answer has to do with purely technical

things like you know we've designed at
its height we designed some really great

01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:26.130
its height we designed some really great
 

01:10:26.130 --> 01:10:27.470

all of those websites don't work on

01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:31.830
all of those websites don't work on
 

01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:34.250
all of those websites don't work on
iPads now because of the decision that

01:10:34.250 --> 01:10:34.260
iPads now because of the decision that
 

01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:36.950
iPads now because of the decision that
they made it Apple not to accommodate

01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960
they made it Apple not to accommodate

actually effectively change the game for
 

01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:48.650
actually effectively change the game for
everyone else and so that ends up being

01:10:48.650 --> 01:10:48.660
everyone else and so that ends up being
 

01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:51.140
everyone else and so that ends up being
kind of a bit of a frustration and and

01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:51.150
kind of a bit of a frustration and and
 

01:10:51.150 --> 01:10:53.030
kind of a bit of a frustration and and
even when it's not quite as deliberately

even when it's not quite as deliberately
 

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:55.430
even when it's not quite as deliberately
frustrating is there just the change in

it will look good in a big monograph
that big and we'll also kind of be

the name of the game going forward Oh
what's yes sorry

be space you know what does that imply

01:13:07.010 --> 01:13:07.020
be space you know what does that imply
 

01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:09.320
be space you know what does that imply
and I think it's interesting because I

01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:09.330
and I think it's interesting because I
 

01:13:09.330 --> 01:13:10.640

think that answer is changing all the
 

01:13:10.650 --> 01:13:15.860
think that answer is changing all the
time and you know even now I'd say that

01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:15.870
time and you know even now I'd say that
 

01:13:15.870 --> 01:13:18.950
time and you know even now I'd say that
um we're like at this moment I think

different ways and you can kind of like

01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:37.170
different ways and you can kind of like
 

01:13:37.170 --> 01:13:39.680
different ways and you can kind of like

stuff like that and that and that's like
 

01:13:53.010 --> 01:13:54.290
stuff like that and that and that's like
one of the elements that I think is

01:13:54.290 --> 01:13:54.300
one of the elements that I think is
 

01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:56.090
one of the elements that I think is
