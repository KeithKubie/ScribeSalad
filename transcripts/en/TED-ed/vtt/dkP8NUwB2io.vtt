00:00:07.596 --> 00:00:11.845
How do schools of fish swim in harmony?

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:16.409
And how do the tiny cells in your brain
give rise to the complex thoughts,

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:17.470
memories,

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.377
and consciousness that are you?

00:00:20.377 --> 00:00:24.006
Oddly enough, those questions have
the same general answer:

00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:25.481
emergence,

00:00:25.481 --> 00:00:29.770
or the spontaneous creation of
sophisticated behaviors and functions

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.942
from large groups of simple elements.

00:00:33.942 --> 00:00:37.044
Like many animals, 
fish stick together in groups,

00:00:37.044 --> 00:00:40.002
but that's not just because
they enjoy each other's company.

00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:42.292
It's a matter of survival.

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:45.569
Schools of fish exhibit 
complex swarming behaviors

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:48.208
that help them evade hungry predators,

00:00:48.208 --> 00:00:53.679
while a lone fish is quickly singled out
as easy prey.

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:57.162
So which brilliant fish leader
is the one in charge?

00:00:57.162 --> 00:00:59.122
Actually, no one is,

00:00:59.122 --> 00:01:01.243
and everyone is.

00:01:01.243 --> 00:01:02.763
So what does that mean?

00:01:02.763 --> 00:01:07.330
While the school of fish is elegantly
twisting, turning, and dodging sharks

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.745
in what looks 
like deliberate coordination,

00:01:09.745 --> 00:01:14.799
each individual fish is actually
just following two basic rules

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.242
that have nothing to do with the shark:

00:01:17.242 --> 00:01:21.238
one, stay close, but not too close
to your neighbor,

00:01:21.238 --> 00:01:24.460
and two, keep swimmming.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.054
As individuals, the fish are focused on
the minutiae of these local interactions,

00:01:30.054 --> 00:01:34.375
but if enough fish join the group,
something remarkable happens.

00:01:34.375 --> 00:01:39.908
The movement of individual fish 
is eclipsed by an entirely new entity:

00:01:39.908 --> 00:01:43.905
the school, which has its own
unique set of behaviors.

00:01:43.905 --> 00:01:46.861
The school isn't controlled
by any single fish.

00:01:46.861 --> 00:01:53.622
It simply emerges if you have enough fish
following the right set of local rules.

00:01:53.622 --> 00:01:56.836
It's like an accident that happens over
and over again,

00:01:56.836 --> 00:02:01.995
allowing fish all across the ocean
to reliably avoid predation.

00:02:01.995 --> 00:02:03.629
And it's not just fish.

00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:09.422
Emergence is a basic property of many
complex systems of interacting elements.

00:02:09.422 --> 00:02:14.089
For example, the specific way in which
millions of grains of sand

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:16.668
collide and tumble over each other

00:02:16.668 --> 00:02:21.914
almost always produces the same
basic pattern of ripples.

00:02:21.914 --> 00:02:24.167
And when moisture freezes
in the atmosphere,

00:02:24.167 --> 00:02:27.418
the specific binding properties
of water molecules

00:02:27.418 --> 00:02:33.885
reliably produce radiating lattices
that form into beautiful snowflakes.

00:02:33.885 --> 00:02:36.013
What makes emergence so complex

00:02:36.013 --> 00:02:39.423
is that you can't understand it
by simply taking it apart,

00:02:39.423 --> 00:02:41.586
like the engine of a car.

00:02:41.586 --> 00:02:46.122
Taking things apart is a good first step
to understanding a complex system.

00:02:46.122 --> 00:02:48.718
But if you reduce a school of fish
to individuals,

00:02:48.718 --> 00:02:51.427
it loses the ability to evade predators,

00:02:51.427 --> 00:02:54.238
and there's nothing left to study.

00:02:54.238 --> 00:02:57.674
And if you reduce the brain 
to individual neurons,

00:02:57.674 --> 00:03:00.991
you're left with something that is
notoriously unreliable,

00:03:00.991 --> 00:03:04.206
and nothing like how we think and behave,

00:03:04.206 --> 00:03:05.949
at least most of the time.

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:08.944
Regardless, whatever you're thinking about
right now

00:03:08.944 --> 00:03:13.033
isn't reliant on a single neuron
lodged in the corner of your brain.

00:03:13.033 --> 00:03:17.217
Rather, the mind emerges from
the collective activities

00:03:17.217 --> 00:03:22.024
of many, many neurons.

00:03:22.024 --> 00:03:25.100
There are billions of neurons 
in the human brain,

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.517
and trillions of connections between
all those neurons.

00:03:28.517 --> 00:03:32.149
When you turn such a complicated
system like that on,

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:36.304
it could behave in all sorts
of weird ways, but it doesn't.

00:03:36.304 --> 00:03:40.847
The neurons in our brain follow
simple rules, just like the fish,

00:03:40.847 --> 00:03:46.218
so that as a group, their activity
self-organizes into reliable patterns

00:03:46.218 --> 00:03:48.697
that let you do things 
like recognize faces,

00:03:48.697 --> 00:03:52.531
successfully repeat the same task
over and over again,

00:03:52.531 --> 00:03:58.319
and keep all those silly little habits
that everyone likes about you.

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.896
So, what are the simple rules 
when it comes to the brain?

00:04:01.896 --> 00:04:05.241
The basic function of each neuron
in the brain

00:04:05.241 --> 00:04:09.073
is to either excite or inhibit
other neurons.

00:04:09.073 --> 00:04:12.195
If you connect a few neurons together
into a simple circuit,

00:04:12.195 --> 00:04:15.029
you can generate rhythmic patterns
of activity,

00:04:15.029 --> 00:04:18.465
feedback loops that ramp up
or shut down a signal,

00:04:18.465 --> 00:04:20.276
coincidence detectors,

00:04:20.276 --> 00:04:22.564
and disinhibition,

00:04:22.564 --> 00:04:26.877
where two inhibitory neurons
can actually activate another neuron

00:04:26.877 --> 00:04:29.480
by removing inhibitory brakes.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.086
As more and more neurons are connected,

00:04:32.086 --> 00:04:36.333
increasingly complex patterns 
of activity emerge from the network.

00:04:36.333 --> 00:04:41.555
Soon, so many neurons are interacting
in so many different ways at once

00:04:41.555 --> 00:04:43.737
that the system becomes chaotic.

00:04:43.737 --> 00:04:48.354
The trajectory of the network's activity
cannot be easily explained

00:04:48.354 --> 00:04:51.656
by the simple local circuits
described earlier.

00:04:51.656 --> 00:04:54.630
And yet, from this chaos,
patterns can emerge,

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.001
and then emerge again and again
in a reproducible manner.

00:04:59.001 --> 00:05:02.246
At some point, these emergent
patterns of activity

00:05:02.246 --> 00:05:04.209
become sufficiently complex,

00:05:04.209 --> 00:05:08.557
and curious to begin studying
their own biological origins,

00:05:08.557 --> 00:05:11.293
not to mention emergence.

00:05:11.293 --> 00:05:15.413
And what we found in emergent phenomena
at vastly different scales

00:05:15.413 --> 00:05:19.053
is that same remarkable
characteristic as the fish displayed:

00:05:19.053 --> 00:05:24.420
That emergence doesn't require
someone or something to be in charge.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.230
If the right rules are in place,

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.487
and some basic conditions are met,

00:05:28.487 --> 00:05:33.347
a complex system will fall into
the same habits over and over again,

00:05:33.347 --> 00:05:36.593
turning chaos into order.

00:05:36.593 --> 00:05:39.911
That's true in the molecular pandemonium
that lets your cells function,

00:05:39.911 --> 00:05:43.482
the tangled thicket of neurons
that produces your thoughts and identity,

00:05:43.482 --> 00:05:46.119
your network of friends and family,

00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:50.685
all the way up to the structures and
economies of our cities across the planet.
