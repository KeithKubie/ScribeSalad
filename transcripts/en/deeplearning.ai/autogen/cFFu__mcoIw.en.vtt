and I think this is where it has the

and I think this is where it has the
 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.830
and I think this is where it has the
files specifying the network so let's

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840
files specifying the network so let's
 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.800
files specifying the network so let's
take a look at this file because there's

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810
take a look at this file because there's
 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.320
take a look at this file because there's
a very long file that specifies the

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330
a very long file that specifies the

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.490
the ones you learn about in this course
or maybe one that you heard about from a

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500
or maybe one that you heard about from a
 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.710
or maybe one that you heard about from a
friend or from some literature and look

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720
friend or from some literature and look
 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.539

for an open-source implementation and

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549
for an open-source implementation and
 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.090
for an open-source implementation and

building from there one of the

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989
building from there one of the
 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.229
building from there one of the
advantages of doing so also is that

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239
advantages of doing so also is that
 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.509
advantages of doing so also is that
sometimes these networks take a long

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519
sometimes these networks take a long
 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.699
sometimes these networks take a long
time to train and someone else might

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709
time to train and someone else might
 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.560
time to train and someone else might
have used multiple GPUs and the very

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570
have used multiple GPUs and the very
 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.990
have used multiple GPUs and the very
large data set to pre-trained so

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000
large data set to pre-trained so
 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.270
large data set to pre-trained so
these networks and that allows you to do

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280
these networks and that allows you to do
 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.760
these networks and that allows you to do
transfer learning using these networks

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770
transfer learning using these networks
 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.920
transfer learning using these networks
which we'll discuss in the next video as

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930
which we'll discuss in the next video as
 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.350

well of course if you're computer vision

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360
well of course if you're computer vision
 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.930
well of course if you're computer vision
research are implementing these things

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940
research are implementing these things
 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.570

from scratch then your workflow would be

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580
from scratch then your workflow would be
 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.580
from scratch then your workflow would be
different and if you do that then do

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590
different and if you do that then do
 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.440
different and if you do that then do
contribute your work back to the open

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450
contribute your work back to the open
 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.260
contribute your work back to the open
source community but because so many

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270
source community but because so many
 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.420

vision researchers have done so much

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430
vision researchers have done so much
 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.490
vision researchers have done so much
were implementing these architectures I

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500
were implementing these architectures I
 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.160

found that often starting with open

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170
found that often starting with open

source implementations as a better way

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990
source implementations as a better way
 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.230

was assert a faster way to get started

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240
was assert a faster way to get started
 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.650
