00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
 Come and write it down 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.240
 Try to write it down because the number is a bit long 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.340
 2385 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.260
 79 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.560
 Just like your salary? 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.980
 Yeah, it’s like this, isn’t it? 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.160
 So I want to tell you something interesting about this number, I will tell you why this is interesting 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.720
 This number is exactly the 13*53 quadratic 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.000
 *3853 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.640
 *96179. The interesting thing now is that the numbers I wrote are all prime numbers. 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.600
 The number of these factorizations, 13 is a prime number, 53 is a prime number, 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.919
 3853 is a prime number and 96179 is a prime number. 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.020
 So these are the factorization of this number, but see how you got this number 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.460
 This is the 13 you got, right? 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.160
 Then 53 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:57.860
 Then is 2 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.660
 Then there is 3853, and there is 96179 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.100
 What did we do? I did not do this. This is a guy named James Davis. 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.460
 He is not a mathematician. According to our understanding, we really don't know who he is. 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.000
 He came up with a counterexample 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.120
 One of the questions about John Conway's 1000$ 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.080
 John Conway, famous mathematician, you should know him, very important 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.500
 He came up with five questions, if anyone can solve them, or you know, find counterexamples, things like that, 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.420
 Then he will give them $1,000. 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.420
 Therefore, we have to have the habit of asking questions in mathematics. 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.720
 You should not hope that this problem can be solved in your life. 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.120
 So I think he owes this James Davis 1,000 pieces? 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.500
 So what's wrong with John Conway? 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.940
 Well, this is a counterexample obtained by climbing the prime number method (any number is applicable) 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.580
 So if I just take a number, for example 60 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.460
 Then what I have to do is write down the factorization of this number. 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.000
 So in the case of 60, this is 2 squares 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.680
 *3*5 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.500
 Now what I have to do is (this is what John Conway suggested) to do it over and over again. 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.480
 All these numbers, write them down 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.000
 So I have to write 2235 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.560
 So, the number I am getting now is 2235 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.820
 Now, I am doing factorization again, so this happens to be 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.640
 3*5 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.260
 *149 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.460
 So now you can do this again, create a new number, 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.480
 Of course the new number will be 35149 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.980
 This is a prime number 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.520
 John Conway’s guess is that if you keep doing it all the time 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.300
 Will break in a prime number 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.800
 So give you an example. 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:01.060
 With 25, this is of course 5 to the 2nd power, 5 to the 2nd power to take 2 to get 52 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.000
 Ok, 52 is 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.860
 2 to the power of 2 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.720
 *13 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.700
 Take 2 of the 2nd power, 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.780
 So this has to be 2213, this is the prime number. 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.620
 This seems to be feasible, because the two examples are feasible, and this is almost impossible to prove (this rule is correct), right? 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.940
 However, no, there are many such examples. 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.000
 This rule has not been found to be a counterexample 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.820
 Take 20 as an example. Someone has repeated this rule hundreds of times. 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.020
 Did not climb to the prime number (end point), 20 is a special (interesting) number 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.600
 But in any case, there are no known counterexamples. 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:39.600
 Until a few days ago, this blog called James Davis responded, 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.880
 A math blog called Hans Havermann discusses this on the web (James Davis's reply: HEY Hans! You are the only one I found on Google to solve this problem, and I found a number that you might be interested in) 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.140
 So (Hans) this post was probably released 7 to 8 months ago. 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.180
 Then one day, James Davis released "I have a solution" 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.880
 Then here is his solution 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.760
 Then he realized that if you enter a circle, you will end up with the same number 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.660
 This is a counterexample because this rule should end with a prime number 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.860
 But if you fall into a loop, you will never end in a prime number 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.840
 So this is one of the numbers that can cause a loop 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:19.120
 If you fall into a loop, you use a number to do factorization 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.740
 Then you do it the way we just described, you will end up with the same number 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.920
 So this is an easy-to-understand counterexample. 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.980
 So this is how he (James Davis) won him (John Conway), he (John Conway) 1000 yuan. 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.440
 And I think this is good 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:42.420
 You know, in this age, people can be unprofessional mathematicians, physicists, and so on. 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:48.040
 They can still think of things that can affect the world. This is a good example. 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.740
 I don't know, I don't like to think about the upcoming death (John Conway in 2017 is 80 years old) 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:03.360
 And you know, I don't have much time. I don't quite know how much. 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.000
 But I still like to do math, so I will always do it.
