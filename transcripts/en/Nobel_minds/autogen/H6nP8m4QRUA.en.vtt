hi I'm Edward I'm studying physics and I

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790
hi I'm Edward I'm studying physics and I
 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.610
hi I'm Edward I'm studying physics and I
was wondering what this the escape

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620
was wondering what this the escape
 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.700
was wondering what this the escape
velocity if the Milky Way is Edward

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710
velocity if the Milky Way is Edward
 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:08.870
velocity if the Milky Way is Edward
you'd like to know what is the escape

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880
you'd like to know what is the escape
 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.600
you'd like to know what is the escape
velocity of the Milky Way this actually

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610
velocity of the Milky Way this actually
 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.240
velocity of the Milky Way this actually
is not very well known because we don't

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250
is not very well known because we don't
 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.300
is not very well known because we don't
know how massive the Milky Way is but we

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310
know how massive the Milky Way is but we
 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.189
know how massive the Milky Way is but we
have seen a few stars that come flying

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199
have seen a few stars that come flying
 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.170
have seen a few stars that come flying
out of the center and they seem to be

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180
out of the center and they seem to be
 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.429
out of the center and they seem to be
going fast enough to get out when a

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439
going fast enough to get out when a
 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.200
going fast enough to get out when a
binary star encounters the black hole in

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210
binary star encounters the black hole in
 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.269
binary star encounters the black hole in
the middle of the galaxy it's possible

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279
the middle of the galaxy it's possible
 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.209
the middle of the galaxy it's possible
for for the one of them to get such a

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219
for for the one of them to get such a
 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.979
for for the one of them to get such a
kick that it comes out at a thousand

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989
kick that it comes out at a thousand
 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.200
kick that it comes out at a thousand
kilometers per second which is about

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210
kilometers per second which is about
 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.450
kilometers per second which is about
five times the orbital velocity of the

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460
five times the orbital velocity of the
 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.639
five times the orbital velocity of the
Sun around the center so maybe a

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649
Sun around the center so maybe a
 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.319
Sun around the center so maybe a
thousand kilometers per second is the

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329
thousand kilometers per second is the
 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.190
thousand kilometers per second is the
escape velocity but it's not measured
