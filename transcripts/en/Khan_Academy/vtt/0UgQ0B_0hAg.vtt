00:00:00.465 --> 00:00:04.209
- [Voiceover] We're now
in 1944 and the things

00:00:04.209 --> 00:00:07.897
are really starting to close
in on the Axis powers now.

00:00:07.897 --> 00:00:09.435
We can start in January.

00:00:09.435 --> 00:00:11.666
You might remember, you've
had the Siege of Leningrad

00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:13.614
going on for several years now.

00:00:13.614 --> 00:00:15.054
Incredibly bloody siege,

00:00:15.054 --> 00:00:17.993
incredibly hard on the
civilians of Leningrad.

00:00:17.993 --> 00:00:20.853
But the Soviet army is
finally able to end that,

00:00:20.853 --> 00:00:23.423
and so you see from these
troop movements on this map

00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:27.013
starting in January of 1944
with the end of the siege,

00:00:27.013 --> 00:00:29.050
they are able to really take the offensive

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.162
and start marching through the Baltics,

00:00:32.162 --> 00:00:33.760
through the Baltic states.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.839
At the same time, you have
the Soviet armies marching

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:42.560
and they're able to force
the Axis to surrender

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.727
in the Crimea.

00:00:44.726 --> 00:00:48.633
You fast forward further into
the year, further into 1944.

00:00:48.633 --> 00:00:51.907
You might remember in
1943, the Allies were able

00:00:51.907 --> 00:00:56.563
to land on Italy and force
the surrender of Italy

00:00:56.563 --> 00:00:58.017
to the Allied powers.

00:00:58.017 --> 00:01:00.518
But that doesn't mean that
Italy, as we know it today,

00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:04.363
or even as we knew it then,
was free of the German troops,

00:01:04.363 --> 00:01:06.273
or from the Axis troops.

00:01:06.273 --> 00:01:09.890
And so, the Allies were
continuing to slog through,

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.508
slog through Italy,
and in particular Rome.

00:01:13.508 --> 00:01:16.483
Rome did not get liberated in 1943.

00:01:16.483 --> 00:01:18.621
The Allies had to continue bombing Rome.

00:01:18.621 --> 00:01:23.313
And it doesn't get liberated
until June of 1944.

00:01:23.313 --> 00:01:25.790
So Rome is liberated.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.707
So liberated in the summer of 1944.

00:01:30.761 --> 00:01:32.448
That happens June, 5th.

00:01:32.448 --> 00:01:34.802
The next day, and this is
probably one of the most

00:01:34.802 --> 00:01:36.747
famous events in World War II,

00:01:36.747 --> 00:01:38.197
especially from an American point of view,

00:01:38.197 --> 00:01:40.374
something that's documented in many films,

00:01:40.374 --> 00:01:42.541
is June, 6th, D-Day, 1944.

00:01:44.025 --> 00:01:45.872
You have the invasion of Normandy,

00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:47.749
the amphibious invasion of Normandy,

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:50.391
probably most famously
depicted in the opening scenes

00:01:50.391 --> 00:01:52.191
of Saving Private Ryan.

00:01:52.191 --> 00:01:54.778
We have British, primarily
British and American troops.

00:01:54.778 --> 00:01:57.883
They are able to storm the
beaches of Normandy successfully

00:01:57.883 --> 00:02:01.870
which allows them to start making progress

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.349
in northern France towards Germany.

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:08.190
Now, also in the summer of 1944,

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.052
rockets start to get
involved in a serious way

00:02:11.052 --> 00:02:12.249
in World War II.

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:15.459
The Germans are starting
to send their V1 rockets

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.292
over to Great Britain.

00:02:18.232 --> 00:02:20.274
And the V1 rockets,
this is just significant

00:02:20.274 --> 00:02:21.314
from the history of technology.

00:02:21.314 --> 00:02:24.756
Obviously today rockets play a big deal

00:02:24.756 --> 00:02:26.668
in a whole bunch of context,

00:02:26.668 --> 00:02:28.286
and this was the first time
that they were deployed

00:02:28.286 --> 00:02:30.409
in a major way during a war.

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:32.951
The first V1 rockets, they
weren't all that impressive,

00:02:32.951 --> 00:02:35.627
they traveled three or four
hundred miles per hour,

00:02:35.627 --> 00:02:37.664
slower than modern jet-liners.

00:02:37.664 --> 00:02:39.700
They didn't travel at
that high of an altitude.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.266
But as we'll see, or as
we'll see even in this video,

00:02:42.266 --> 00:02:45.562
within a few months, by September,

00:02:45.562 --> 00:02:47.277
they were sending in V2 rockets,

00:02:47.277 --> 00:02:49.069
which were far more advanced,

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:50.725
going several thousand miles per hour,

00:02:50.725 --> 00:02:53.926
getting to altitudes
of tens of miles high,

00:02:53.926 --> 00:02:55.788
and carrying even larger payloads.

00:02:55.788 --> 00:02:57.839
So the Germans were really
starting to push the envelope

00:02:57.839 --> 00:03:00.105
in terms of rocket science.

00:03:00.105 --> 00:03:02.374
What's good about the Allie
is, is that the Germans

00:03:02.374 --> 00:03:05.172
were kind, they developed this
technology a little bit late.

00:03:05.172 --> 00:03:07.492
They are starting to be
on the heels, obviously,

00:03:07.492 --> 00:03:10.791
on both the Western front
and the Eastern front,

00:03:10.791 --> 00:03:12.506
and even in the South the Allies

00:03:12.506 --> 00:03:14.042
were really on the offensive now,

00:03:14.042 --> 00:03:15.786
but rockets are starting to get involved.

00:03:15.786 --> 00:03:19.953
V1's in the summer, and
then the V2's in the fall.

00:03:22.113 --> 00:03:25.211
Now, also as we go into
the late summer and fall,

00:03:25.211 --> 00:03:28.631
you see that Russians, after
defeating the Germans at Kursk,

00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:30.381
are marching towards,

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:35.232
are marching towards Poland,

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:38.886
and marching in particular towards Warsaw,

00:03:38.886 --> 00:03:40.719
as we go through 1944.

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.222
And at the end of 1944,
not the end really,

00:03:45.222 --> 00:03:48.747
at the end of the summer of 1944,

00:03:48.747 --> 00:03:50.391
in August of 1944,

00:03:50.391 --> 00:03:55.320
you have the Polish uprising,
you have kind of the rebels.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.170
The underground is taking
on the German occupiers.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.170
So this is August, 1944.

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:04.518
August, 1944.

00:04:04.518 --> 00:04:07.201
With the Russian troops,
or the Soviet troops

00:04:07.201 --> 00:04:09.560
not that far away, they're
getting closer and closer

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.901
and closer to Warsaw.

00:04:11.901 --> 00:04:16.068
Now, also in August of 1944,
you have Paris, is liberated.

00:04:17.523 --> 00:04:20.023
So this is August, 25th, 1944.

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.052
Paris is liberated.

00:04:25.052 --> 00:04:27.500
And then, as we go later into that year,

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.083
British troops are able
to liberate Athens.

00:04:32.153 --> 00:04:35.106
So British troops are
able to liberate Athens.

00:04:35.106 --> 00:04:36.965
So Athens is liberated.

00:04:36.965 --> 00:04:38.616
And actually this, once this liberated,

00:04:38.616 --> 00:04:41.301
then you start having the
beginnings of the Civil War,

00:04:41.301 --> 00:04:43.566
of the Greek Civil War that occurs

00:04:43.566 --> 00:04:46.992
between kind of the government
troops and the Communists,

00:04:46.992 --> 00:04:49.639
or as you say the more left-leaning people

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:53.806
who were involved in fighting
against the Axis powers.

00:04:55.264 --> 00:04:56.706
So, even though they were liberated,

00:04:56.706 --> 00:05:00.233
it's kind of the start of
another unfortunate chapter

00:05:00.233 --> 00:05:02.154
with the Greek Civil War.

00:05:02.154 --> 00:05:06.152
And then, finishing out
1944, the Axis powers,

00:05:06.152 --> 00:05:08.079
and particularly the Germans,
they weren't done yet.

00:05:08.079 --> 00:05:10.002
Even though the war is not looking good,

00:05:10.002 --> 00:05:12.755
they finally mount a,
I guess you could say

00:05:12.755 --> 00:05:14.504
one of their last counteroffensive,

00:05:14.504 --> 00:05:16.593
just not their last
major counteroffensive.

00:05:16.593 --> 00:05:20.510
And that's over here
against the Allied troops,

00:05:21.753 --> 00:05:23.317
particularly the American troops,

00:05:23.317 --> 00:05:25.511
at the Battle of the Bulge.

00:05:25.511 --> 00:05:28.511
And this starts in December of 1944.

00:05:30.006 --> 00:05:32.110
It's called the Battle of the Bulge

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.061
because the shape in
which, so if the Allied,

00:05:35.061 --> 00:05:37.455
you know, the front, the
Allied front looks like that

00:05:37.455 --> 00:05:39.623
as it is advancing.

00:05:39.623 --> 00:05:41.982
The Germans mount a counteroffensive

00:05:41.982 --> 00:05:43.729
and they are able to create a,

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:46.042
what's called in military terms a salient,

00:05:46.042 --> 00:05:48.669
where they're able to push through,

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:50.293
where they're able to push through

00:05:50.293 --> 00:05:53.922
and kind of create, and create this bulge.

00:05:53.922 --> 00:05:56.233
This is an incredibly bloody battle,

00:05:56.233 --> 00:05:58.510
it's actually the most bloody battle

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:59.921
faced by American troops.

00:05:59.921 --> 00:06:03.588
They lose nearly 20
thousand, not just lose,

00:06:04.464 --> 00:06:07.353
20 thousand die, American troops die

00:06:07.353 --> 00:06:09.600
just in the Battle of the Bulge

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.534
that starts in December of 1944.

00:06:12.534 --> 00:06:16.321
But this really is the
Germans last hurrah.

00:06:16.321 --> 00:06:17.962
You can see they're riding on the wall,

00:06:17.962 --> 00:06:19.498
troops approaching from the West,

00:06:19.498 --> 00:06:21.343
troops approaching from the East,

00:06:21.343 --> 00:06:24.176
troops approaching from the South.
