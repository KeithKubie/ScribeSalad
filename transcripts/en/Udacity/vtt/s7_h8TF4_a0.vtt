00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.690
Here's a example of the UML timing diagram.

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:07.330
If your familiar with the design of digital chips, it should look very similar.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.140
In digital chips obviously you're worried about electrical signals arriving at

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.990
a certain time in response of the silicon and germanium in that chip,

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.030
how long it's going to take to happen. If you need, in fact,

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:24.250
to diagram out specific timing of situations in your system you

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.198
can use the UML timing diagram to do that. Time marches from left to right and

00:00:29.198 --> 00:00:32.549
arrows indicate the places where timing has to be synchronized.
