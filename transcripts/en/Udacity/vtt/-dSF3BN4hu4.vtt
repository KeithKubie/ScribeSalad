All right, For our 7th and final problem I want you to try dividing these two

00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.101
rational expressions. This is a challenge problem, so it's going to be a little

00:00:05.101 --> 00:00:11.260
bit tougher than one's you're used to. I'll admit, the hardest part is actually

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.444
factoring, but if you do get the correct answer then great job. You're on your

00:00:15.444 --> 00:00:19.155
way to becoming a pro at factorizing and rationalizing expressions.
