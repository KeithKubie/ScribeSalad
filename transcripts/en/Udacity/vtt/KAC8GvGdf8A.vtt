00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.430
Now that we have looked at learning curves,

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.340
let's look at another performance metric, the accuracy.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.130
In case of a classifier,

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.050
the accuracy is the fraction of predictions that are correct.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:17.880
By correct, we mean the negative instances are classified as negative,

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.420
and the positive instances are classified as positive.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.390
The loss function, in this case, is a 0, 1 loss.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.440
The risk is given by the misclassification error.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.980
Another way to look at this,

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.050
is simply to count the number of times our model correctly classified our data.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.070
So, the accuracy of a classifier can be given as the sum of the true

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.040
positives and the true negatives, divided by the total number of occurrences.
