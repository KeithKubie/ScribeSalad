00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well the reason why mass is so important is because it is relevant to gravity,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and it's not just relevant in the sense that a mass feels the effects of gravity.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Masses actually cause gravity.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The reason why a person standing on the earth doesn't fall off--well there's 2 reasons.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
One is because the mass of the earth is producing gravity,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and the second is that the mass of the person is feeling the gravitational force.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Without both of these masses, there would be no force.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Charge is very similar except that charge causes the electric force,

00:00:35.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and that force is felt by other charged objects.
