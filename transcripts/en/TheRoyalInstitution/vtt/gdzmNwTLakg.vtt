00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.220
Many speakers have stood in this theatre over the years

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.720
contemplating the nature of the universe.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.580
Whether time travel is possible, could we build a time machine?

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:30.240
As a nation, we adore our science fiction time lords and the star trekkers who can transport themselves

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.420
at a flick of a switch through space onto alien worlds.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.880
But the reality is that we already have a device

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.540
that can do all of those things and more

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:50.140
a teleportation machine that can effortlessly transport us to different times and different places

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.260
I'm talking, of course, about the brain. The universe within.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:07.300
In this discourse I am going to consider why and how the brain allows us to accomplish this wondrous feats.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.600
And the answers in fact come from an understanding of memory.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.720
We're endlessly fascinated by memory, we desire to improve it, we fear its loss.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.660
As this quote illustrates quite nicely I think,

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:49.020
But the importance of memory goes beyond the individual and their personal autobiography.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:57.540
We share memories and in many ways memories are the glue that holds society together. They're the basis of culture.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:05.180
If you think about it, if we didn't have memory, we would constantly keep reinventing the wheel

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.140
and there would be an awful lot of 'ground hog' days.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:17.180
Well I'm going to show you that memory is not just one thing. It also doesn't just occur in a vacuum.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.460
It's not even that accurate and in fact it's not really about the past

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:36.500
Scurrilous notions you might think but I'll argue that these features are in fact the key to our ability to mentally travel through space and time.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.020
So let me illustrate.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.060
There are many different types of memory, it's not a unitary phenomenon.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:53.280
So we have short term memory and this is for information that we need to hold on to or rehearse for immediate use.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:01.840
Now the example I've given here is phone numbers but I realize now, actually, that in a sort of perverse reversal

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.080
that in fact our phones have actually become our short term memories.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:14.640
But we also have long term memories and one sort of long term memory is skills or habits.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.160
So we learn to ride a bicycle and then it becomes automatic, we can do it effortlessly, probably for life.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.880
And then there are these other types of memories, the rich, personal memories that punctuate our lives.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.320
And these are known as episodic or autobiographical memories.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:43.840
Now we know there are these different types of memories because damage to different parts of the brain impact selectively on these memory types.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:53.360
So for example, in a classic amnesia, which I'll talk more about later, patients cannot form new memories

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.080
and they often lose the memories of their past experiences.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:04.960
But despite what the Hollywood movies would have us believe they do remember who they are.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.760
They do remember who their families are and they remember facts about the world.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.200
It's this selective loss of autobiographical memories that they have.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:24.880
By contrast, there's a certain type of dementia  where the first thing that's compromised is this sort of memory.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.800
The memory for facts about the world, concepts, their vocabulary, their naming ability.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:37.680
But their autobiographical memories, at least in the early stages of the disease, is intact.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:45.360
So memory comes in different forms, supported by different brain areas and of course they all interact.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:54.720
Now another important feature of memory is illustrated by an experiment from over forty years ago

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.720
but it still makes the point in a very compelling way.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:05.520
Now the experiment would take too long to do here but let me just give you a sort of sense of it.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.600
So it involved text such as this.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:15.440
And subjects had to memorize this text, so let me read quickly through it.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.280
*reads text on screen*

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:08.320
So there is the subject, faced with this piece of text, had to memorize it.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:14.560
Tricky I think you'll agree because it doesn't really make much sense.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.600
They saw this scene.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.080
And then they memorized the text.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:41.600
And the subject who saw this scene very briefly did much better on the memory test than those who weren't exposed to the scene.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.800
So memory works better if it occurs in a context.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:56.960
If we can draw upon our prior knowledge about how the world works and link the incoming information with what we already know.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:04.800
Now testing memory also consistently reveals something else of importance.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:14.320
Now I would be failing in my duties as a memory researcher if I didn't take the opportunity to test your memories.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.520
Okay.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.240
So, let's get down to business.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:25.680
You're going to see a countdown of three... two... one...

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:32.080
Then you're going to see a picture flashed on the screen very briefly so you've got to pay attention.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:37.200
There'll be a brief visual mask and then you'll see a second picture.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:45.360
And all you have to do is say whether the second picture is the same view as in the first picture.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.280
Whether it's closer up or further away.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.800
Okay.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.080
So I believe you have some voting pads

00:07:54.080 --> 00:08:00.160
So if we could have a look at the voting pad options. There we go.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:07.120
So you're going to press button A if you think the second picture is closer up.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.040
You're going to press button B if you think it's the same.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:15.520
And you're going to press button C if you think it's further away.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:17.520
Okay.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:21.040
Don't worry, we'll remind you again before you have to make your decision.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.080
And that's not even the memory test.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.400
So if we could go back to the laptop now.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.520
Right.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.160
So are you ready?

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.080
It's going to be really quick, I'm not joking. Okay?

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:48.240
Right, if we could have the options up again please

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.280
Now.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:56.720
Was the second picture closer up, the same, or further away?

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Blink and you miss it!

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:08.160
So you should go with your gut instinct on this now. Don't over think it, over thinking it is bad.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.120
I'll just let everybody finish their voting.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:19.120
Have a guess if you're not sure. A, B, C.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.160
What do we think?

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.720
All done? Everybody finished?

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.400
Good? Okay, Let's have a look at the results if we may.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:34.160
Okay, so we see that a lot of you thought that it was closer up.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:39.200
And we see that some of you thought that it was the same.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:43.040
And a smaller number thought that it was further away.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.400
Okay.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:49.040
We're gonna do another one. So anyone who missed it

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.320
Press your buttons.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.960
Right, let's, uh

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.640
Let's go back to the laptop if we may.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.720
Right. Okay. Don't blink, you'll miss it.Here we go.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:12.000
Right, if we could have the options up again.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.480
A, closer up.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.480
B, the same.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.360
C, further away.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.840
Okay, let's see what we've got.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.120
Okay, very similar.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.960
Somebody's invalid but we won't go into that.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.360
There's always one.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:41.520
So you can see we're actually quite consistent across the two tests. We've got around the sixty percent mark of people thinking it was closer up.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:50.080
And we have some people thinking it's the same and a few, much fewer thinking, that it was further away.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.040
Okay, if we could go back to the laptop.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.920
Okay. Now.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:10.160
I have to tell you that in fact on both of those tests

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:15.920
the second picture was identical to the first picture.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:20.560
And sixty percent of you got it wrong.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:27.600
There was a quarter of a second delay between the first picture and the second picture.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.400
And you still got it wrong.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.760
That's not very good memory is it?

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:40.320
Well, I'm going to explain a bit later on why so many of you made that error.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:51.680
But what it illustrates is that memory is not a faithful record of the past, even when the past was a quarter of a second ago.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:56.240
It's not flawless, its fallible.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:05.360
But in fact these sorts of errors are built into the very structure of the memory system and for good reasons.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:17.360
In a similar vain, we often bemoan the fact that we forget things and we'd love to be able to remember more. But be careful what you wish for.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:26.480
A number of years ago, some rare individuals were discovered that never forget anything that has ever happened to them.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:33.280
And this has come to be known as highly superior autobiographical memory.

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:40.720
Now I'm not talking here about the sorts of people who enter the world memory championships.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:51.600
You know, the sorts of people, they can remember pi to 67,890 decimal places. I think you'll find is the current world record.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.520
Fascinating as they are and we've studied them

00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:04.720
But in fact those sorts of people typically use mnemonics or strategies and they practice and they practice so it's very effortful.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:08.800
I'm talking, instead, about people like this.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.760
*reads text on screen*

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:11.120
So you can appreciate that remembering absolutely everything is not desirable and we should rejoice in our normal forgetting because believe me, it is a good thing.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:17.280
So, we have established that there are different types of memory.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:23.200
That memory is designed to work in the context of our existing knowledge.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.240
That memory is not perfect, that there are errors.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:31.200
And the question we need to ask is, "why is memory like this?"

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:40.400
Well it has to do with the other scurrilous claim I made earlier which is that memory is not really about the past

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:45.360
and to explore this, we need to turn to the brain.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:56.400
Here is the brain in all its glory, thanks to the wonders of magnetic resonance imaging or MRI.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:05.600
And you can see here the sorts of detail and views of the brain. Here we're face-on, here we're side-on,

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.320
here we're looking down through the top of the head.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:18.080
We can see the grey matter, the white matter. We can appreciate the complexity of the connections between brain areas.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:32.160
Now the formal study of the brain basis of memory really took off in the 1950s with this patient, H.M. or Henry Molaison.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:36.800
Now poor H.M. suffered from intractable epilepsy.

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:44.160
And in order to alleviate his seizures both of his temporal lobes were removed.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:50.800
And you can sort of see the black areas here is where his temporal lobes use to be.

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:56.400
Now the surgery did indeed reduce his seizure frequency

00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:03.840
but it had the unintended and devastating side effect of making him densely amnesic.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:12.400
So after the surgery, he couldn't form any new memories. He lost much of his past.

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:19.680
But he did retain factual knowledge about the world. His short term memory appeared to be fine.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:24.320
His general intellect was fine as were his social skills.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:33.120
So he appeared to have this selective loss of his autobiographical or episodic memory.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:41.360
So contrast this with the description we read earlier of the patient with superior autobiographical memory.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.600
So H.M. is asked

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.440
*reads text on screen*

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:15.280
Now at the time his deficit was linked to one particular part of the temporal lobe.

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:19.520
And that part of the temporal lobe is the hippocampus.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:26.720
Which you can see here, deep in the temporal lobes there in red, circled in red here in this little cartoon

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:31.680
and circled in the three views in the MRI scan.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:38.880
And it's called the hippocampus because an early anatomist likened it to a seahorse.

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:49.200
This is a slightly icky picture of a hippocampus taken out of a human brain but to illustrate that it does look quite like a seahorse or hippocampus.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:18:00.800
Now in fact you can hopefully see that H.M.'s surgery took away a lot more than his hippocampus

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:05.440
so his memory problems cannot really be linked with certainty to the hippocampus.

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:17.680
However in subsequent decades we have located patients who appear to have selective damage of just the hippocampus on both sides

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:22.000
as far as our current anatomical imaging can tell us.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:30.640
And they have very similar profiles in terms of their memory preservation and impairment as H.M.

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:43.120
And of course studies of healthy subjects where we infer neural activity from blood flow on functional MRI or FMRI scans

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:48.640
confirm the engagement of the hippocampus along with other brain areas

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:52.240
when people recall their past experiences.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:59.760
So the hippocampus is necessary for helping us recall our autobiographical memories

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:03.600
those personal memories that make our lives.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:12.240
But in a different domain, the hippocampus was also under scrutiny.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:23.760
Because in the 1970s, physiologists recording from single neurons in the rat hippocampus made a startling discovery.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:32.560
They found that there were cells that seemed to respond to specific places in the environment.

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:37.600
And this is irrespective of where the rat was looking.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:46.480
And these place cells as they came to be known seemed to in some way embody the memory of that particular place.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:56.560
Now on the right here, we're looking down at a round arena and you can see a little cartoon rat there.

00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:03.040
And what I'm going to play now is a movie and what you'll see is you'll see the rat moving around this arena

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:09.040
and what you'll hear is the sound an actual place cell firing.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:17.360
And you'll see that this place cell likes one particular part of the environment.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:29.680
So you can see he's looking all over the place, even when he's in the northwest of the arena.

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:35.200
But that place cell, he's loving the northwest.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:42.560
Now the rat is going to speed up a bit. I just sped it up but just to save time. He's not manic or anything, so.

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:54.000
But you can see just how specific it is. So even though the rat is going all over the place its really focused on this part of the environment

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:04.880
and then you have of course place cells that cover all different parts of the environment, thus appearing to map the spatial location within that environment.

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:15.760
So here we have a situation where the rat hippocampus, at any rate, seems to be fundamentally involved with processing space.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:24.960
Now since this discovery many studies have examined spatial memory in humans.

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:35.200
Now for example, in my lab we took advantage of this commercially available video game. Some of you might know, it's called "the Getaway."

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:36.560
It's made by Sony.

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:44.080
And they set this video game in central London. And you could navigate within it.

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:52.640
And at the time it was a pretty faithful simulation of London including most of the roads, and the shops, and the buildings.

00:21:52.640 --> 00:22:04.080
So we had subjects find their way around London and in this virtual environment while their brains are being scanned.

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:14.000
So obviously we can't really look at navigation normally if people have their heads fixed in a brain scanner, they're not going anywhere.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.960
But this way we could use this virtual navigation as a proxy for real navigation.

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:27.200
So now I'm going to show you a movie of the results of one of our experiments.

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:38.240
And what we were able to do was we were able to relate the thoughts that people were having during navigation with the brain activity on the FMRI scans.

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:44.080
So on the bottom left you're going to see where the person was actually navigating.

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.480
This is one of the subjects navigating.

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:50.240
Here's a little sort of overview to show you where they're going to go.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:55.120
You'll see the thoughts they were having appearing in thought bubbles up here

00:22:55.120 --> 00:23:04.480
and then you'll see the FMRI activity that was occurring at the time of those thoughts.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:11.120
Right. Now the hippocampus comes on very quickly at the start. So you'll have to be quick to see it.

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:17.280
Because it's involved when you plan and visualise your route when you're about to start.

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:24.720
Okay. So there's him saying he needs to go to Peters Street. So there's the hippocampus, so he's off now.

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:27.840
So now we're moving down Shaftesbury Avenue.

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:31.680
Decided to change routes so some of the frontal areas come on.

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:36.800
Ah, now, there's a blockage. He's gotta take a different route.

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.200
So he's coasting along.

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:45.440
He's planning, his cerebellum comes on, he's gotta take this corner carefully.

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:53.600
Now you'll see look at all the swathes of visual cortex coming on because he's thinking "God these shops look colorful."

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.680
Then he's thinking, "Yeah I should see this." Oh there it is. Good.

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:06.000
And then a little bit of road rage just to end with there.

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:10.480
So you can see that

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:18.880
Virtual navigation, and we believe, actual navigation activates many brain areas but the hippocampus in particular

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:26.960
seems to come on when you're engaged in visually planning your route.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:33.280
Now, we also used this virtual London in another study.

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:41.520
We had the chance to test this patient, patient TT.

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:49.040
He's an extremely rare patient and he had damage primarily restricted to his two hippocampi.

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:53.520
so you can see sort of see the holes where his hippocampi should be.

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:58.560
And naturally he was densely amnesic as a consequence.

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:08.000
Crucially before his illness, he had been a licensed London taxi driver for forty years.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.880
So the question we were able to pose was,

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:25.360
"How would his hippocampal damage affect this long standing navigation skill and his knowledge of the spatial layout of London?"

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:35.920
So here I'm just showing an example trial and what the subjects had to do, including TT,

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:40.080
was get from St. Paul's Cathedral to the Bank of England.

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.640
Easy peasy if you're a cab driver.

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:51.600
And indeed the ten control taxis drivers who were the same age and the same level of experience as TT

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:57.360
look at that, they all took the same direct route. No errors whatsoever.

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:03.040
Now in black we see the route taken by TT

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:11.600
and you can see that he's going all around the houses. He cannot get there and in fact he doesn't get there.

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:14.640
And this was the same in trial after trial.

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:20.160
So they were virtually navigating around London but he couldn't get there.

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:32.560
And the astute amongst you might have realised something about his navigation. In fact, he's using just the A roads.

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:39.520
The big old A roads. And he cannot navigate on the smaller roads.

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:49.680
So he seems to have lost the finer detail of the smaller routes and he couldn't visualize them in his route planning.

00:26:52.080 --> 00:27:01.040
Now of course we had already shown that the back part of the hippocampus, the posterior hippocampus

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:08.240
was larger in London taxi drivers than in non-taxi drivers, including London bus drivers.

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:17.840
And more recently we did a longitudinal study where we took trainees who were learning the knowledge

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:21.520
thanks to the cooperation of the Public Carriage Office

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:27.280
And so we studied them before they started learning the layout of London.

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:31.600
and then we got them to come back when they qualified.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:40.160
Now interestingly, about fifty percent qualified and fifty percent failed to qualify and we also had a control group.

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:51.360
In those who qualified, we saw increased volume in the posterior part of their hippocampus.

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:56.480
At time two, three and a half years later, compared to time one.

00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:02.000
And in those who didn't qualify, we didn't see any changes.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:11.680
So these sorts of studies demonstrate the plasticity of the adult human brain in response to the environment stimulation.

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:16.560
So the brain is not fixed, we can change it by what we do.

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:25.440
But it also underlines the relationship between the human hippocampus and space.

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:35.360
Okay so here we have this brain structure then, the hippocampus, that doesn't work along, it's part of these larger brain networks

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:45.680
concerned with memory, but it nevertheless appears to be particularly critical for autobiographical memories but also for spatial navigation.

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:54.000
And we see devastating effects on these cognitive functions when the two hippocampi are compromised.

00:28:54.320 --> 00:29:01.280
And the hippocampus, it turns out, is vulnerable of a whole range of common pathologies.

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:09.600
Strokes, epilepsy, dementia, including alzheimers disease, loss of oxygen to the brain or anoxia,

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:12.320
and certain types of brain infection.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:21.200
So what is the hippocampus doing that makes it so important for recalling the past and navigation?

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:25.680
Two seemingly different cognitive functions.

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:32.720
Well in the last number of years we've begun to unravel this somewhat.

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:42.080
And once again, the insights come from studying patients with selective damage to the two hippocampi.

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:47.440
And as you would expect, these patients were amnesic, they couldn't find their way around.

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:57.600
But this time we asked them a different question. We asked them to imagine an experience that might happen to them in the future.

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:04.880
So not the past, we know they can't do the past. But what about the future. They couldn't do it.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.440
So then we said,

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:14.720
well these patients can't recall the past, they can't imagine the future; they're stuck in the present.

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:19.760
They cannot travel through time mentally speaking.

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:30.400
We then asked them to just to imagine a simple scene. So not one that was set in the past or the future, and they couldn't do that either.

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:40.640
Now they could imagine single objects so it wasn't just a problem with the basic ability to imagine. They could imagine single objects in their mind's eye.

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:43.840
But they couldn't imagine scenes.

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:50.320
Now I'm going to show you one patient's attempt to construct a scene.

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:54.480
So here it is. The patient was asked,

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:59.200
Imagine you're lying on a white sandy beach in a beautiful tropical bay.

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:03.020
So there is the patient on top, P03. So he says,

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:05.440
*reads text on screen*

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:51.280
And below that I've just put the scene created by a control who's age, gender, IQ matched the patient.

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:55.120
I won't read all of this but you'll see quickly that the control said,

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:57.600
*reads text on screen*

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:17.360
So there's a huge difference between these scenes. The control scene you could quite happily step into.

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:20.880
And who wouldn't want to be stepping into a beautiful tropical bay.

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:35.280
But the patient's scene, it's very fragmented and indeed, they rate their scenes as spatially fragmented and lacking in coherence.

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:40.000
And when we ask them, "What do you think the problem is that you have?"

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.960
And here's some very insightful comments from the patients.

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:48.480
*reads text on screen*

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:26.400
Now, FMRI of healthy volunteers also show that the hippocampus is indeed engaged when imagining fictitious or future scenes

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:35.600
Now based on these findings we suggested that the hippocampus is needed for scene construction

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:47.360
that, it facilitates the construction of complex spatial contexts or scenes into which the details of our experiences then get bound.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:34:02.800
And we proposed that this process underpins episodic and autobiographical memory, imagining, thinking about the future, and spatial navigation.

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:09.520
Now just to be clear I'm not saying the hippocampus does all of these things alone.

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:13.920
There are many brain regions responsible for these cognitive functions.

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:22.640
But what I'm suggesting is despite all the differences between these, the memory, the spatial navigation, the future thinking, and so on

00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:33.680
they each require a special ingredient supplied by the hippocampus and I'm suggesting that's the ability to mentally construct scenes.

00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:40.560
And if you think about it, whenever we recall the past or thinking about something we're going to do in the future

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:48.160
or we're planning a route somewhere, it invariably involves us conjuring up scenes in our mind's eye.

00:34:49.280 --> 00:35:03.040
So, this may seem like heresy, but the hippocampus which has for so long for sixty years been portrayed as the quintessential memory device

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:15.040
may not actually be about memory per se, but instead memory relies on an ingredient from the hippocampus as do other types of cognition.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:28.720
Now, we recently discovered something else about scenes and the hippocampus which I can hopefully illustrate

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:34.480
if I have ten willing volunteers from the audience.

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:41.840
So what I'm going to do is show you a picture, you can do this, imagine you're doing this

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:52.160
I'm going to show you a picture, I will you give you 15 seconds to look at that picture, and please know I am going to test your memory for that picture.

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:56.960
I have a stopwatch, no psychologist goes anywhere without one.

00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:02.240
Right, are you ready people with clipboards. Don't do anything.

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:05.520
You keep an eye now, make sure nobody is cheating.

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:10.880
15 seconds, take it in. Take in as much as you can.

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:13.440
Off you go.

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:36.000
Okay. Please draw what you remember of that picture.

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:42.640
Quick sketch now. Not looking for John Constable.

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:52.960
When you're finished, can you hold you clipboard up in the air, and one of the gentlemen will collect it from you. Okay.

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:54.560
Thank you.

00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:06.480
Okay. So. With the permission of the volunteers, I'm now going to now share these with the audience if that's okay.

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:09.920
Anyone shout out if they're not happy. No? Okay, that's fine.

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:12.000
*laughter*

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.360
Don't worry, we don't have anyone's names on them.

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:18.080
Are we ready for this?

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:19.920
Okay.

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:23.600
Now let me zoom.

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:28.160
Ooh, hello. Right.

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:30.160
Very good.

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:32.720
You'd know they were banana's, right?

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:34.880
Good. Okay.

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:37.600
Now let's have a look here.

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:39.520
Okay.

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:40.640
*laughter*

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:46.400
Well you know, you'll see it's not bad, it's not bad.

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.000
Okay.

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.080
And there we have

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:56.000
some other ones, capture the shape there nicely. Very good. Excellent.

00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.800
And we'll do this quickly.

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:05.200
Good. No? Come on. People laughing weren't drawing I notice.

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:08.640
There we go, lovely. Very nice.

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:14.560
Ooh now look at this. Went very very big on the old background there.

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:19.440
Very good. Very good.

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:23.600
In fact all of our volunteers deserve a nice round of applause.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:27.840
That's quite sort of slightly deconstructed one there.

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:29.280
Okay.

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:33.120
Now. I'm not quite sure what way to put this.

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:45.440
Well we get the drift, we get the drift. Very good.

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:49.280
And again very nice on the background there.

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:52.880
And then we'll end with this one.

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:57.120
Very good. Okay. Now.

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:04.080
Excellent efforts I think you'll agree under intense scrutiny.

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:12.080
But I wonder did you notice something about these drawings. There's something not quite right.

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:20.320
I'm not going to psychoanalyse people on the basis of these. That's a whole other discourse.

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:31.280
But if we can just go back to the slides, are we still on them. Okay let's go back to the drawings, see if we can identify what's not quite right.

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:38.720
Okay so there we have the bananas. Now look at the bananas, people.

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:44.080
These are big bananas, these are in your face bananas.

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:48.560
These are bananas that take up much of the picture.

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:53.360
Now, let's go back to the visualiser.

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:01.920
These aren't big bananas, these are little bananas.

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:04.160
Little tiny bananas.

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:07.200
Or little nano bananas.

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:25.680
In fact, if we look at all of these diagrams or pictures, you'll notice that everyone has put in a lot more space around the bananas than there was in the original picture.

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:29.840
And there's a very good reason why people did this.

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:37.440
What you've demonstrated, our volunteers, is a phenomenon called "Boundary Extension."

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:46.080
Now boundary extension is a robust and consistent memory error found in adults and children.

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:53.520
But it only occurs in relations to scenes and not single objects and it occurs for this reason.

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:57.360
When we initially encounter a scene

00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:08.320
we're not limited to the direct sensory input coming into our eyes but we also have an access to a wealth of prior knowledge

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:15.200
about the world and so we automatically extrapolate beyond the borders of what we see.

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:25.120
And we include this extra bit of extrapolation into our mental representation of the scene.

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:30.000
And that's why you all included more space around your bananas.

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:41.120
Its also the reason why sixty percent of you made this error in the earlier test.

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:52.080
Because when you saw the first picture, you extrapolated beyond the view automatically. You can't stop yourself doing it.

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:58.160
And that became built into your mental representation of he scene.

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:03.040
So here's what you added to it and this is what you ended up with in your head.

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:14.000
So when the second picture came along it now looked much closer up than the actual picture you were comparing it to.

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:24.240
Even though it's exactly the same as the study picture. And you only had a quarter of a second gap between the two.

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:32.000
In fact, you only need as little as 42 milliseconds gap and people still make this error.

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:39.920
So boundary extension depends on scene construction

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:49.520
because you have to imagine and construct what might be beyond the view. And while it might be an error, it's a highly adaptive error

00:42:49.520 --> 00:43:00.800
because it allows us to rapidly embed the world which we're only able to sample a little bit at a time into a wider, larger spatial framework

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:06.960
thereby giving us the experience of a seamless and continuous reality.

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:16.000
Now we've recently found that patients with selective damage to the hippocampi and amnesia

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:26.240
show greatly reduced boundary extension. So if we take a couple of the pictures from our drawing task

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:28.160
you'll recognise the bananas.

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:36.320
Here is the performance of two of the control subjects. And you'll see those bananas, they look quite similar to some of these bananas.

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:41.120
Lots of extra space around the bananas.

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:45.120
And here's the picture from one example patient.

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:52.720
You can see the patients make much less of an error, they include a lot less space.

00:43:53.680 --> 00:44:02.400
And if we look at the rapid picture test. So here I'm showing you the patients in red and the controls in blue.

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:11.200
You can see that on sixty percent trials the subjects,  the controls, thought it was closer up. They made the error you made.

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:17.760
Not the patients though. No, they knew it was the same picture. They got it correct.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:30.800
So paradoxically, tests like these show that patients who are profoundly amnesic actually score much better on memory tests than healthy controls

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:37.600
because they can't make the error. They can't imagine what's beyond the view.

00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:47.840
So patients with hippocampal damage, and this includes patients with dementia and other pathologies, not just the selective cases we have here.

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:59.200
But they're not only contending with problems recalling the past, with navigation, with imaging fictitious and future scenes or scenarios

00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:03.680
they are literally stuck with what's in front of their eyes.

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:14.240
Deprived of a level of subjective continuity, unable to even visualise what's behind them or what's around the corner.

00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:27.360
And so this leads us to the actual reason for memory and the function of the hippocampus.

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:33.680
Memory is not about the past, its about the future.

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:45.280
It's about helping us predict and infer, based on previous experiences and prior knowledge, what to do next.

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:50.480
Where to go. What to do. What to expect.

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:58.240
And in this way, the purpose of memory, the hippocampus, indeed the brain, is survival.

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:06.160
And this was actually preempted quite a number of years ago.

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:14.720
In fact, in 1798, one year before this institution was founded, Immanuel Kant said,

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:22.560
"Recalling the past only occurs with the intention of making it possible to foresee the future."

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:29.680
Or to put it another way; as the White Queen from "Through the Looking Glass" observed,

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:34.160
"It's a poor sort of memory that only works backwards."

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:46.720
So memory works best in the context of our prior knowledge and yes, it makes errors but that's what makes it so powerful and flexible

00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:57.520
it's not a perfect record of the past. It's constructed and reconstructed depending on the state of our knowledge and the state of the world.

00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:10.000
And I suggest that a key part of this process is the construction of spatially coherent scenes in the hippocampus that form the basis

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.560
of our personal and of course our shared past.

00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:21.440
So I'll conclude by mentioning that the story doesn't end here.

00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:28.080
We want to know more about these processes and mechanisms, the memory traces that arise from them.

00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:39.360
How these memory traces change as we age. How do we examine them in the contexts of brain injury and disease.

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:49.280
Well, using the latest high resolution functional MRI scanning, and new decoding algorithms.

00:47:50.320 --> 00:48:05.840
We've been able to predict solely by examining the patterns on FMRI scans and particularly in the hippocampus where someone is located in a virtual reality environment.

00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:11.680
So we can know where they were just by analysing the pattern of their brain activity.

00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:16.880
We can also tell what specific memory they're recalling

00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:27.360
be that movies that we've showed them before scanning or indeed their own autobiographical memories. We can predict what they are recalling.

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:37.120
So these exciting new technologies will ensure that the future of memory research is an exciting one.

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:46.720
And so I will end by thanking all the people and the funders who make research like this possible.

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:53.200
Thank you all very much for participating, particularly our volunteers. And thank you all for listening.

00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:56.000
*applause*

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:18.560
Thank you so much for a fantastic discourse. I've got to say, I love it when I come to these events

00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:22.640
and I actually find out so much more than I ever knew before and it's quite amazing.

00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:28.640
So we've got about twenty minutes of questions so if anyone would like to ask something just stick you hand very high in the air

00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:33.680
and wait for the microphone to come to you please. So just start off with this gentleman in the first row. Thank you.

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:44.400
Given that 35 percent of us pressed button B, is that by chance or are we all early onset dementia?

00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:52.720
Please don't worry sir, I don't want to send you thirty percent of, let's face it, successfully doing the task accurately.

00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:59.360
No, I mean we've only just done two and there are some, you know we do a lot more in a complete trial

00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:05.520
For some people, some boundary extension effects are elicited more strongly on some stimuli than others.

00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:17.680
It all comes out in the wash, don't worry. The patients as you saw performed much more differently than the control.

00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:20.800
I'm gonna swing over to this gentleman in the purple tie.

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:24.880
Thank you very much. Very interesting lecture.

00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:33.920
I wondered if any work had been done with novelists or similar people who create pictures but in words

00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:40.240
and whether that involves just the same bit of the brain or if there are other bits involved when you try and do that.

00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:45.840
It's a very interesting question because everything that I sort of presented today is very visual.

00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:54.560
And a lot of the theories about memory, including our own scene construction theory relate to memory that's spatial or visual

00:50:54.560 --> 00:51:02.000
and the question you're asking is an excellent one. What happens in terms of verbal material.

00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:09.520
Now patients with hippocampal damage also cannot recall stories that are told to them.

00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:17.200
Or if they read them and it's interesting that the patients when we're chatting with them, they say,

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:22.240
"I can no longer read. I use to love books and now I can no longer read them."

00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:27.360
And it turns out that they can't imagine the events as they're unfolding.

00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:40.720
So it seems to come back to translating the verbal into a visual modality to help them sort of with the plot in the story. So, good question. Thank you.

00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:42.880
Do we have anyone else in the gallery Martin?

00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:43.600
Alright.

00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:47.280
Ooh, very good.

00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:54.240
My memory is so appalling that I don't even remember exact name of the disorder you mentioned early in the lecture

00:51:54.240 --> 00:52:00.080
where people have an extenuated ability to remember, such that they refer to it as being a burden.

00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:08.960
That is the first of my questions in relation to that. What percentage of the population, it might even be a number of people, would actually have that?

00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:11.760
Because that's, it is quite extraordinary.

00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:22.160
It's quite extraordinary, and many many years ago a famous neuropsychologist called Luria first really documented the first case of this.

00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:34.480
But in recent times the group in California, they have now found about twelve people since this sort of research has become famous

00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:37.440
and they've been asking people to get in touch.

00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:47.200
And they found a lot of people with really really good memories but only about twelve seemed to have this phenomenon so

00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:53.120
it's very difficult to estimate on that basis, what proportion of the population it might be.

00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:57.520
It's still very early days in trying to unravel exactly what it's about.

00:52:57.520 --> 00:53:00.240
Thank you and obviously very different from people saying,

00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:04.000
"Oh he has a photographic memory, he remembers everything which is a different..."

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:10.320
It's a different thing and you know, memory comes in different shapes and sizes for all of us you know

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:13.760
some people have very good memories, some people less good memories.

00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:18.160
I just have one other question too, just in relation to the people who can't remember.

00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:24.960
The gentleman you mentioned who had a part of his hippocampus removed to treat his epilepsy.

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:31.120
Surely they have an emotional response, a frustration for not being able to remember or is that taken as well?

00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:34.720
I guess that's a subject for a number of lectures.

00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:39.920
Yes. It is interesting. I mean that they definitely know that they have a problem

00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:46.160
You know, they know they have a memory problem. But when you talk to them and you interact with them

00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:53.920
obviously when they came to see us, they're very motivated to be there, they often forget through the day why they're there.

00:53:54.880 --> 00:54:04.960
But they're very very appropriate emotionally and socially but of course that doesn't mean that at some level they don't feel loss

00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:15.040
they definitely know they've lost something and they've lost their independence you know they can't live independently anymore.

00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:18.400
It's terribly devastating.

00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:20.000
And just finally my last question...

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:26.400
Sorry can I just interrupt there, you've had two very good questions but many many down there, maybe you can't see them from up there.

00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:29.840
Someone in the, the lady in the red. Just there please.

00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:42.720
If one could imagine something like a scene but you can't feel the sand, you can't feel the heat

00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:50.320
but you can plan for the future, from that information what would you deduce is right or wrong with the brain?

00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:58.400
So you think that there are people who can visually... so you can visually imagine the scenes

00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:06.240
but you can't imagine the sort of touch or feel? Okay well we haven't really gone into that in very much detail.

00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:12.720
Our scene construction theory is a very recent one so we're still finding out a lot more about it

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:19.200
and that would be very interesting to think about the multi modal nature of scenes

00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:23.680
the fact that you hear things, you smell things, you touch things, and you see things.

00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:31.680
What I will say is that the boundary extension effect where everybody put more space

00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:40.160
we also did another version of that test where we took away vision, so we blindfolded all of our subjects

00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:53.760
and we had them feel scenes and we took the borders of the scenes away and they had to put markers down where they thought the border of the scene was

00:55:53.760 --> 00:56:00.400
again they put way too much space in. So the point of that is that it isn't just being driven by vision,

00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:13.840
it also occurs in the context of other modalities. But we do need to learn more about how those modalities get and combined into the full experience of a scene.

00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:18.480
And I saw a question, oh there's two here. Maybe the gentleman on the end and then the gentleman behind.

00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:24.800
Does a place cell when they fire help to create the memories?

00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:27.200
That's a really good question.

00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:33.120
So place cells have been around for a long time. They've been really really researched a lot.

00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:43.040
But we still don't quite understand how they do what they do and what their precise relationship is to memory.

00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:52.880
So we don't know exactly what happens. We do know that place cells map the environment such that the environment gets covered.

00:56:52.880 --> 00:57:02.000
We know that the hippocampus' next door neighbour, a part of the brain called the entorhinal cortex, has different types of cells

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:09.440
called grid cells which fire literally in grids across an environment.

00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:14.480
It seems to me as if it's like a database where it's put in a memory somewhere into the brain.

00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:24.800
Well it's difficult, we just don't know. We know that this type of cell in rats is mapping the space. It's much harder to map these things in humans

00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:34.960
we can't just stick electrodes in. Where people have been having surgery again for epilepsy, sometimes they record intracranially

00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:37.760
to try to find the focus of the seizure.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:46.480
And sometimes those electrodes are put into the hippocampus and people have found responses that look quite like place cells

00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:52.720
so we think there are also place cells in humans. And then the question is what are they doing,

00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:57.920
is it that space underpins all of our memories, underpins scenes and so on.

00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:06.400
And somehow it's creating the memory of that spatial context which then all the other bits of memory get added too.

00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:07.820
We don't know.

00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:08.320
Thank you.

00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:12.080
So two rows behind the gentleman with his hand stuck up.

00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:16.880
Thanks, I'm quite interested in this rat.

00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:19.200
My manic rat?

00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:25.280
Yes, you're proposing really that the hippocampus has got a lot more active role to play in memory

00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:31.440
it's not just this sort of memory storage device, intrinsically related to autobiographical memories.

00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:40.320
And also looking forward to the future. And to me an autobiographical memory is sort of intrinsically related to a sense

00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:45.360
what makes us human, is it that we have this very strong idea of identity in who we are.

00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:49.760
But given that we share hippocampi with rats and presumably alligators and other things

00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:57.760
what can you say about what these other animals might have in terms of a sense of self given that the hippocampus seems to be much more

00:58:57.760 --> 00:58:58.720
than a database?

00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:00.080
Very good question.

00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:06.880
Autobiographical memory are our personal past. They're very important to helping us develop a sense of self.

00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:13.040
But interestingly, people who are interested in the self have done lots of other studies.

00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:22.240
And they've found that in fact issues to do with ourself, our perception of ourselves, things that are self relevant

00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:30.640
how we evaluate ourselves are more likely to involve areas of frontal cortex, not the hippocampus.

00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:40.800
Now I think when we retrieve an autobiographical memory, of course we know the hippocampus is talking to the frontal cortex

00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:49.200
they have a lot of interactions. And so the frontal areas may be the processing part to do with the sense of self.

00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:54.640
And that could make sense if you then look at the hippocampus across species

00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:58.880
because the hippocampus is quite well preserved across species.

00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:04.080
You look at a rat hippocampus and a human hippocampus you can see they look quite similar.

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:12.800
And so the suggestion would be that the algorithms playing out in a rat hippocampus are likely to be also playing out in a human hippocampus.

01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:22.240
And maybe the sense of self which we don't know if a rat has a sense of self. But we do know that is has much much smaller

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:25.840
and some people would argue doesn't at all have a frontal cortex.

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:35.280
So the other interesting thing to say is that in recent years, the people who record from in the rat hippocampus

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:45.440
have found not only activity of the place cells when the rat is moving around in the place but also preplay

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:53.520
where rats are put in a position where they have to make a decision in the future. The place cell seems to, the firing seems to sweep

01:00:53.680 --> 01:01:00.160
ahead of the rat, almost like its trying to plan for the future and that's called preplay.

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:10.800
So again that would fit with what we're saying for the hippocampal side of things and then maybe things to do with the self are a bit more in our big old frontal lobes.

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:17.280
Okay. I'm just gonna just take... your hand went up so quickly then I couldn't...

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:19.440
Just... the boy there. Thanks.

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:21.840
And then I'll take two from over this side after that.

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:28.640
So more on the rat basically.

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:31.040
Oh, I don't study rats but I'll do my best.

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:39.520
So I didn't understand what exactly was a place cell doing because the rat going around the place and the place cells were firing but it didn't seem to affect the rat's behavior any.

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:41.520
It was still going around completely normally.

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:49.600
Yes so the rat in these situations normally, what they have them doing is going around foraging for a little little snacks or treats.

01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:56.240
And they're measuring the place cells so the place... obviously the rat does what he does.

01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:04.640
He probably has other place cells that are firing when he's in other parts of the environment but we just didn't hear those recordings.

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:12.160
And so basically his hippocampus is automatically mapping the space for the rat.

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:22.400
And so if we could hear all of the place cells we would hear a symphony of firing but we only hear just one just to show you how specific they are

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:26.880
and how they're not visually dependent. So the rat could be looking in a different direction

01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:30.880
but once he's in that part of the environment, the place cell fires.

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:34.400
Okay and there's a lady right there, thank you.

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:38.000
Hello, thank you very much, that was extremely interesting.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:44.240
I'm just wondering how much, and I've had to look up on my little Google on my phone because I couldn't remember what they were.

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:49.600
How much you took into account the learning styles.

01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:53.520
You know, the logical, the kinesthetic, and the visual.

01:02:53.680 --> 01:03:00.640
Because I work with people and I take people sometimes on a guided imagery path.

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:05.520
And I know that there are lots of people who would say at the end, you know,

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:13.440
they wish I was less descriptive because they were thinking they were on a palm tree beach

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:15.600
and I was describing a mountain spring.

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:20.480
And there are other people who would say, you know, I just couldn't.

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:27.280
I wish, you know, they'd rather I said more because they couldn't imagine anything more than the man who had the damage.

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:32.720
And so my experience has been, unless these people have got damage that I don't know about, and I don't think they did,

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:38.720
my experience has been that there are people who actually don't have that visual capacity and that creative imagination

01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:44.960
and I wonder how that plays a part in all of your research and the actual science of it as well.

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:50.160
I think that's a really excellent question. So again this is all fairly new stuff

01:03:50.160 --> 01:04:02.400
and what we want to do is exactly that. We want to try and find out about how well or otherwise people generally can imagine and construct scenes.

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:10.480
And we want to try and relate that to their memory performance and their navigation performance to do exactly what you said

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:18.880
and I suspect that what we'll find is that there are people who find it very difficult to visualize and we know that

01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:26.880
because even in some of our studies so far, we've tested, you know, healthy controls who found the task very difficult.

01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:33.760
and so the question is, is that impacting upon their memory ability and are they the sorts of people who end up

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:39.600
with poorer memories than somebody who can imagine things quite well.

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:43.920
So watch this space, we'll let you know.

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:48.400
Okay there's someone just directly behind you, did you want to ask a question? Your hand was up earlier.

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:52.400
No? Okay. I'll take somebody up in the gallery, I saw someone waving their hand in the gallery.

01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:59.520
Hello. Hi. Sorry about the rat again but two rats now in the same environment

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:09.520
if you map the place cells of the first rat, the second rat with the second part of the same place cells

01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:11.600
or will they be different with each rat?

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:14.160
Well I think with... so it's an interesting question.

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:26.720
So everybody's neurons are their own and including a rat, and so I think you couldn't infer something from one rat's place cell about another rat.

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:35.760
And that you know that's true also of people. So if you don't mind me bringing it back to people just to answer the question.

01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:46.640
So at the end I alluded to the fact that we're able now to look at activity in FMRI scans while people are recalling their own personal past

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:53.520
and we can predict just from the activity, we know what memory they're recalling.

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:58.720
And everybody has their own personal past and the memories are unique to them

01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:09.040
and so, you know, the set of neurons I activate for my particular memory are gonna be very different to the neurons you activate for your memories.

01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:14.400
And that's one of the pluses of this new approach is that we can look at everyone as an individual

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:20.000
and we can see exactly how their activity maps onto their psychology if you like.

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:24.640
So now I'm even more amazed that we're all so interested in rats.

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:25.200
I mean clearly we're gonna have to...

01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:28.160
I have to say I normally don't get many rat questions.

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:33.680
But sadly we're reaching the end of the time for questions.

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:37.920
I'm really very sorry, I know there are lots of you with your hands in the air.

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:43.520
I just... we just don't have time to have any more questions I think.

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:48.560
Thank you all very much for coming, we'll see you here again the next discourse or even maybe one of the public events before that.

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:53.760
Thank you so much for those people who did ask those questions and stimulate the kind of discussion and debate.

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:55.920
Which I think is wonderful in this small sort of space here.

01:06:55.920 --> 01:07:00.480
And once again if you'd like to all join me in thanking Eleanor for a fantastic discourse.

01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:02.400
*applause*
