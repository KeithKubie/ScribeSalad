00:00:00.914 --> 00:00:02.830
STEVE PERRY: In a small
Silicon Valley office,

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.180
Salman Khan is using simple
illustrations and lingo

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.920
to explain math, science,
history, and even business

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:10.820
concepts.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.300
SALMAN KHAN: If this
does not blow your mind,

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.270
then you have no emotion.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.470
STEVE PERRY: The 10 to 20-minute
tutorials on khanacademy.org

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.650
are free to anyone, anywhere.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:22.270
Sal.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.250
You have found the answer, man.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.510
SALMAN KHAN: Hopefully.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.730
We've got a lot of work to do.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.938
STEVE PERRY: No, I'm serious.

00:00:26.938 --> 00:00:29.419
You've opened up the world
of learning to the world.

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:31.960
SALMAN KHAN: The best way to
get at the core of most issues--

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.970
whether it's poverty,
health care, whatever,

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.150
even democracy-- is making
sure you have an educated

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.310
population.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.530
And so the technology
is now making it

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.350
so that the delivery
cost of that education

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.517
is going pretty close to 0.

00:00:46.517 --> 00:00:48.850
DEAN BRETTLE: Instead you get
31 instead of negative 31.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.641
STEVE PERRY: Dean
Brettle uses Khan Academy

00:00:50.641 --> 00:00:52.930
as a tool for homeschooling
his two children.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:53.770
DEAN BRETTLE: What
I like about it

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.450
and what I think the
kids like about it

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.210
is that you can work
at your own pace.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.460
If they don't understand the
video, they can pause it.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.700
They can rewind it.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.230
They can watch it
multiple times.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.665
CHILD: Seven.

00:01:03.665 --> 00:01:05.540
DEAN BRETTLE: And you've
already got the 2's.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.590
STEVE PERRY: And
with Khan, you have

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.740
to master all the
material before moving on,

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.520
with only hints to help you.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.561
DEAN BRETTLE: If you're
struggling with something

00:01:12.561 --> 00:01:15.800
in a regular school,
and you don't get it

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.057
but you take the
test, and you get--

00:01:18.057 --> 00:01:18.765
STEVE PERRY: A C.

00:01:18.765 --> 00:01:19.980
DEAN BRETTLE: A C on the test.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.450
STEVE PERRY: Can't
move on with a C here.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.195
DEAN BRETTLE: That's right.

00:01:22.195 --> 00:01:23.160
STEVE PERRY: You trying
to kick teachers out?

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.520
Because that's what a lot of
teachers then start to think.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.010
SALMAN KHAN: No, it's
the complete opposite.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.400
What it does, at
least in my mind,

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.090
it would make the job of
teaching a lot more fun.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.714
Because they come in
every day and they

00:01:31.714 --> 00:01:34.572
get to actually be guides and
mentors for these students.

00:01:34.572 --> 00:01:36.780
STEVE PERRY: Like fifth
grade teacher Richard Julian.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.210
His Los Altos, California
school uses Khan lessons

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.250
in math class.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.540
The software tracks
each student's progress.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.560
RICHARD JULIAN: And by doing
that it allows the teacher

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.080
to know their
students very well.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.705
It allows them to
know their strengths.

00:01:49.705 --> 00:01:51.422
It allows them to
know their weaknesses.

00:01:51.422 --> 00:01:53.130
STEVE PERRY: Khan
Academy is a nonprofit.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.150
But it's backed by
Bill Gates and Google.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.040
You could make money
from this, you know.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.673
[SALMAN LAUGHS]

00:01:58.673 --> 00:02:00.640
You can make a lot of money.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.890
How many distinct users
do you have per month?

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.640
SALMAN KHAN: It's
pushing two million now.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.280
STEVE PERRY: You're
the math guy,

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.810
but $1 apiece isn't
that much to charge.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.610
You're doing this
for free, partner.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.340
What gives?

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.645
SALMAN KHAN: You know, if
Khan Academy was for profit,

00:02:18.645 --> 00:02:21.850
it would limit the number
of kids who would use it.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.820
Hopefully when I'm
80, I can say, wow,

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.644
there's a billion
kids that use it,

00:02:25.644 --> 00:02:27.060
and maybe will
continue to use it.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.520
And maybe even
after I'm gone, this

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.450
can be an institution
that can last

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.500
for 100 years or 200 years.
