00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.980
Death is something that all of us must deal
with at some point in our lives - whether

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.260
it be a family member, a pet, or even your
own eventual end. In fact, about 100 people

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.759
die every minute in the world. But what actually
happens when you die?

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:18.290
In the first few seconds after death, the
last bit of oxygen in your body is depleted

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:23.269
and brain activity surges. As the neurons
begin to stop functioning, your brain stops

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:28.060
secreting hormones which regulate body function.
And while some bodily functions may persist

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.410
for a few minutes, as the remaining stores
of ATP are used - which is your body’s main

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.610
energy source - the muscles relax, including
sphincters, which means defecation and urination

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:38.610
may occur.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.960
Around 15-25 minutes after death, the lack
of blood flow through the capillaries leads

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.610
to the paleness of death seen in light skinned
people. Because your heart is no longer running,

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.730
there is no active propulsion of blood through
the body so gravity begins to cause pooling

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.930
of blood in the lowest parts of the body.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.040
After a few hours of blood pooling a reddish
purple discolouration of the skin occurs,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.860
and reaches its maximum discolouration by
12 hours. This is one of the ways in which

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.490
coroners and forensic investigators determine
the approximate time and position of a body

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.490
at death.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.120
Within 3-6 hours, the infamous rigor mortis
sets in; not only has your body lost its energy

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.271
source, but deterioration of cellular organelles
leaks calcium into muscles cells, and this

00:01:18.271 --> 00:01:23.070
binds to proteins which are responsible for
muscle contraction. This causes uncontrolled

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.909
tensing or stiffness of muscles, making the
body ‘stuck’ in a position, lasting anywhere

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:29.990
from 24-48 hours.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.640
Up to this point, unless you’ve been chemically
embalmed or preserved in some manner, your

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.300
body has been slowly decomposing as well,
undergoing cell death. Without proper blood

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.950
flow, these dead cells accumulate and along
with CO2 gas, cause the ph of tissues to rise.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.450
This weakens the cell membrane, eventually
causing them to burst and release their cytosol,

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.020
which contains functioning proteins and enzymes
that further breakdown surrounding tissue.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.460
There are also around 100 trillion microorganisms
that help to break down your body. The anaerobic

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.780
bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract begin
to eat through abdominal organs. This process

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.459
is known as putrefaction and it’s where
things get stinky. Breakdown of amino acids

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:15.400
by the bacteria produces extremely foul gases,
which attracts certain insects like mites,

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.189
carrion beetles and blowflies which lay eggs
in the rotting tissue. The eggs hatch within

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:24.700
a day, and the larvae or maggots eat the tissue
to survive until they mature.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.319
After weeks, these maggots may consume 60%
of the body’s tissue, creating holes that

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:36.250
allow decomposition fluids and gasses to escape.
Between 20-50 days, butyric fermentation begins,

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.919
attracting beetle larvae, protozoa and fungi.
This process, known as dry decay, can take

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:44.080
up to a year, but occurs faster in hotter
temperatures.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.360
Over years, plants and animals eat away at
the remaining bits of the body, including

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.669
skeletal remains. Eventually, if left completely
to the elements, every bit of the body will

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:56.689
be broken down and its constituent molecules
will be recycled.

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:01.390
