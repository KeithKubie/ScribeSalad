00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.800
JIM MEEHAN: Thank you all
so much for coming.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.190
Thanks to John Henry,
as David said.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.720
He has sponsored our cocktail
today with El Buho Mezcal,

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.300
which I'll be demonstrating
in just a sec.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.750
And I've been nagging John for
about a year, politely, of

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.810
course, because I knew that if
he knew David, and I'd hope to

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.900
come and speak to you guys.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.850
In many ways, I am here
because of you.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.550
And I'm not sure if
you know that.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.990
And part of what I'd like to
happen during this Google Talk

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.840
is to open up a dialogue
about not only-- you

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.180
want me over here?

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.940
Don't forget your cocktail.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.295
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:40.295 --> 00:00:43.360
JIM MEEHAN: I'd like this Google
Talk to eventually

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.000
become a dialogue, because I
think that not only am I here

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.560
because of what you guys are
doing, but I think that the

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.310
future of what I do depends on
the sort of work that you do.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.850
And I'm not sure what brought
you here today.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.270
I imagine a cocktail might help,
maybe a book would help.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.620
I don't know if David mentioned,
but we've brought

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.250
PDT hats, t-shirts--

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.550
we have El Buho t-shirts--

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.940
and all of the books that I have
on stage on my demo table

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.400
over there are going to be given
out to one of you for

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.420
asking a question after
I stop rambling.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.040
So I don't know why you came,
but hopefully, for whatever

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.070
reason you're here, you
will be rewarded.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.790
But what I'd like to do today
are a few things.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.520
First I'd like to demo the
drink that I made.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.580
It's a perfect drink for Cinco
de Mayo, which is coming up in

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.280
just four days.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.910
So I figured for those of you
who came out to maybe learn a

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.700
thing or two about mixing
drinks, I could show you how

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.750
easy it is to make the
drink you're having.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.010
And next I'd like to talk
about the book I wrote.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.470
It came out in November 2011,
"The PDT Cocktail Book." But I

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.410
want to take a bit of a
different spin, I want to

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.050
actually talk about the process
that I used to come up

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.620
with this book.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.210
A lot of times people, they'll
come up to me and ask me, so

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.980
you wrote a cocktail book,
what was it like?

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.979
What made you want to
write this book?

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.740
And I think that it's really
hard to write something new or

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.780
to create something new when
you don't know what's come

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.290
before you.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.300
So I'd like to talk about the
process that I used to develop

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.760
"The PDT Cocktail Book" and I'd
like to introduce a big

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.680
idea that I'll throw in the
beginning, that I'd like you

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.340
guys to marinate on as the
Mezcal floods into your veins.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.050
And maybe we'll talk about
it together in

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.950
about half an hour.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.770
But as I said before, I believe
that the internet,

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.430
Google, YouTube, Wikipedia, on
and on, and on his change the

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.450
way we learn, it's changed
the way we searched.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.770
My generation--

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.880
I'm 36, I'll be 37 this year--

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.130
was one of the last generations
that went to the

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.720
library, when we needed
to find something out.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.370
The last time I went to the
library I felt like I needed a

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.530
master's degree to learn
how to use it.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.590
The internet is a lot easier
to use than the library.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.960
But one of the things I found,
as a kid, when I used to go to

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.070
the library, before I used the
internet to find information,

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.350
was, when I looked something up
in a card catalog and found

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.380
out where the shelf was to find
it, on my walk to the

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.250
shelf I'd oftentimes pass books,
all sorts of different

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.450
books-- books about ship people
tying knots, or guns of

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.170
the early Civil War, or just
books that were very

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.980
interesting to me.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.120
And I found that not only in
what I'm going to talk about

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.480
with "The PDT Cocktail Book",
but in how kids and my

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.690
generation is searching these
days, that in many ways what I

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.470
learned along my searches, was
just as interesting as what I

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.960
was going to get.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:59.490
And one of the things that is
confounding, ironic, maybe

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.270
sad, is that when we Google
something, or when we search

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.010
for something on the internet,
it takes us exactly to what we

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.080
are looking for usually, and it
doesn't allow us to go on

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.310
that journey along the way and
see other things that might

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.920
interest us.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.110
So why don't we get to
this drink before I

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:20.380
exhaust that topic.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.810
In thinking of Cinco de Mayo,
the Margarita is obviously the

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.730
cocktail that is most
on our mind.

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.300
In creating a new cocktail--

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.730
which I guess you could call
this a new cocktail--

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.580
I often take a classic
cocktail--

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:33.290
the Margarita--

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.280
and play around with it.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.380
The Margarita--

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.780
tequila, lime juice, Triple
Sec, Cuantro.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.200
I usually use a little agave
nectar to sweeten it, to

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.670
balance it out.

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.450
So I took that and I played
around with it.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.420
I'm going to use El Buho Mezcal,
I'm going to use

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.760
fresh-squeezed lime juice, a
little bit of agave nectar--

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.270
I usually lengthen it into a
syrup so it pours easier--

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.290
and then a couple twists.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.380
And these are things that you
probably will see if you go to

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.840
cocktail bars in New York, like
Mayahuel, which features

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.670
agave cocktails in
the East Village.

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.570
But you've found that your drink
from five-six years ago

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.110
has gone from maybe
a delicious sour--

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.900
something like a Sidecar
or Cosmopolitan--

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.060
something that is strong--

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.550
it's actually good drinks--
sweet and sour, and then

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.880
people are adding bitters
to their cocktails now.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.040
And then later people were
adding Saint Germain and Creme

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.800
de Violette and floral
ingredients.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.520
Then people were adding herbs
and herbal liqueurs, like

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.610
Chartreuse, and adding
that herbal quality.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.630
And then, finally, people have
started adding spice and hot

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.280
things, so this is
a Hellfire Shrub.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.640
So taking that original recipe,
I'm going to take a

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.890
shishito pepper, which
isn't generally hot.

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.640
They say that a few of them
in each batch is hot.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.500
I'm going to add half
an ounce of--

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.470
a little bit less, because
this isn't a syrup--

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.090
add that on top of
the shishito.

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.710
I'm going to give
that a muddle.

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.630
And what I did for your
cocktail-- which is in that

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:03.470
giant camera over there-- was
I put all this on top into a

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.230
large bin and just muddled
that, just like

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.070
you're seeing here.

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:13.020
I'm going to add an ounce of
freshly-squeezed lime juice.

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:19.955
And then I'm going to add 2
ounces of El Buho Mezcal.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.360
And you'll notice that when
I'm making this cocktail,

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.370
because I'm speaking, I
haven't added any ice.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.280
I'm a big proponent when you're
making cocktails,

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.750
especially, when you're making
cocktails at a bar like mine,

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.370
where I might be making three
or four cocktails at a time.

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.550
Build your cocktails without any
ice and let them sit, so I

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.040
could make four of these
if I wanted.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.940
And then as soon as you're
ready, then that's when you

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.230
want to ice your shaker
and shake.

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.650
And, John, I don't actually
have a glass up here.

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.810
So this allows me an opportunity
for John, my handy

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.250
barback to come and
bring me a glass.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.415
I'm going to add my ice
on the other side.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.840
John Henry, El Buho Mezcal,
thank you very much.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.820
Give it up.

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.690
It takes a village, everybody,
it takes a village.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:10.800
So I'm going to get
that together.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.500
You want to get a nice
strong seal there.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.400
I always seal the
cocktail shaker.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.630
You want to seal right here,
so that it's easy to open.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.400
If you put the cocktail shaker
straight in, you're going to

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.330
have a hard time
getting it out.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:22.590
Give it a nice hard shake.

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:30.430
[SHAKING COCKTAIL]

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.580
If you go to a cocktail bar, and
they're not shaking very

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:37.560
hard, order a beer and a
Maker's on the rocks.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.450
Strain that.

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:42.110
You can fine strain it, if you
don't want all the little

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:44.100
seeds there.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:44.810
And that's it.

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:47.350
This is the cocktail, if I were
serving it at home, I

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:49.700
could put a salt rim on it, I
could add some Chile to the

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.360
salt and make it a
little colorful.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.730
I could add citrus zest.

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:55.530
I could add all sorts of
stuff and maybe only

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:56.620
do salt on the side.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.790
You could add a shishito pepper
there if you wanted.

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:00.530
You could garnish it
with a lime wheel.

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:02.070
What do you guys think?

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:02.960
Refreshing?

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.430
For some of you, it might
be a little too sour.

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.600
For some of you, it might
be a little too strong.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.650
For some of you, it might
be a little too sweet.

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:15.220
One of the things that a lot
of people of my credentials

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:18.330
maybe don't mention is
that's OK, we all

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:19.730
have different tastes.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:20.820
So the beauty of--

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:22.890
I feel like-- every
recipe is modular.

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:25.680
So if it's too sweet, pull back
a little on the agave; if

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:30.100
it's too strong, pull back on
the Mezcal, and on and on.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:30.940
So that's your cocktail.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.044
Does anyone have any left?

00:08:33.044 --> 00:08:34.760
Man, all right.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.000
Because I wanted to make sure
that we weren't getting in the

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.610
way of efficiency here
at Google today.

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:45.180
And I wanted to get you, guys,
a good buzz before I started

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:47.990
on my journey.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:51.980
Now, as I said, part of what I
want to talk about is not only

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.700
the book that I wrote, but
the journey that I

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.920
went on to write it.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.600
I first started working at the
Pegu Club on Houston Street

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.660
with Audrey Saunders in 2005.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.980
Audrey Saunders was
Dale DeGroff's--

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.180
Dale DeGroff was her mentor.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:13.340
She worked with him right when
he was leaving the Rainbow

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:16.940
Room; was the head bartender at
Dale's bar that was opened

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:18.020
called Blackbird.

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:21.920
When Blackbird closed, Dale
brought in Audrey as the head

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.800
bartender at Bemelmans.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.980
Audrey ran Bemelmans for many
years and then opened the Pegu

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:27.030
Club in 2005.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:31.100
And for me, this is very much a
watershed moment in New York

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:32.900
cocktail history.

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.070
I got to be on the
opening bar team.

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:37.450
At that time it's hard to
imagine, because there are

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:39.640
dozens and dozens of great
cocktail bars, even in

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.610
Brooklyn, much less
Manhattan now.

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:43.840
But at that time, the cocktail
bars in New York were really

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:50.110
Milk &amp; Honey, Flatiron Lounge,
Angel's Share--

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:53.170
those were the main ones.

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:56.870
Basically, there was three or
four bars Employees Only was

00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:00.200
almost open, and Little Branch
was almost open.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.650
So there were five great
cocktail places.

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:05.630
Audrey opens the Pegu Club, and
it was really sort of a

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:07.420
coming out party for
the cocktail.

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:12.790
In these years 2005, 2006,
2007, you really see the

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:16.180
cocktail bar and the cocktail
bartender go from person to

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:19.400
person to person, to place to
place to place, till the last

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.160
couple years, where three places
are begetting nine

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.640
places, and nine places are
begetting 18 places.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.040
So we're seeing an exponential
growth.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.110
But at the Pegu Club Audrey--
and still to this day-- had a

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:33.030
collection of vintage cocktail
books behind the bar.

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:36.080
And at the time I was interested
in cocktail books.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.320
I had Dale DeGroff's "The Craft
of the Cocktail." I had

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.240
Gary Reagan's "The Joy of
Mixology", which you'll see.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.230
I had Ted Haigh's "Vintage
Spirits and Forgotten

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:45.760
Cocktails", which you'll
see in my presentation.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.200
But I really wasn't aware
of how many old books

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:48.880
that were out there.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:53.050
And Audrey had original copies
of the 1862 Jerry Thomas, of

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:57.410
the 1948 "Fine Art of Mixing
Drinks" by David Embury.

00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:01.570
She had the 1937 "Gentleman's
Companion" by Charles H. Baker

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:03.880
and all these beautiful books
for us to look at.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.550
And I immediately realized that
there's so much about the

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:09.590
history of bartending, and so
much about what I was doing

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:11.920
for her there that I really
wasn't aware of, and I wanted

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.860
to investigate more.

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:18.130
I went to eBay and started
spending all of my tips on old

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:21.390
bar books and started meeting
people who had

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:22.940
more of these books.

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.120
I'm going to forward
to my first slide.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.890
1862, Jerry Thomas.

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:30.220
This is the first "Bartender's
Guide".

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:33.860
The book on the left, the one
that's sort of old brown one,

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.920
that is the first edition.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.890
The green book on the right
is the 1876 edition.

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:41.990
And the book in the middle
with the torn cover--

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:44.390
so these are all my copies; they
would have weighed about

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:46.600
70 pounds, or I would
have brought them--

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.300
is the 1923 edition with an

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.450
introduction by Herbert Asbury.

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:54.650
This is a book that came out
and was printed many times.

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:57.200
You can see the price here,
I think it's says $2.50.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.490
I think it initially started
at $1.25 and then went to

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:01.180
$2.00, and then $2.50.

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:04.220
Each of these books was printed
probably in seven or

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:05.070
eight editions.

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:08.070
And in the early days,
this "Bartender's

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:09.200
Guide" was very simple.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.480
It was a collection
of recipes.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:15.560
The recipes were not umbrella
recipes, like cocktails are,

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.800
they were separated into shrubs,
into punches, into

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.820
scuffers, into negoos,
into sours.

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:24.300
Cocktails were very
categorical.

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.510
And this was a very simple
utilitarian book, that was

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:31.240
obviously meant for bartenders
that had in the 1862 addition

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:36.180
a big appendix that was filled
with information for bar

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:38.760
owners for how to make your own
cordials, how to make your

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:39.610
own bitters.

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:43.690
This was before spirits were
distributed in bottles.

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:47.170
So it had information for how
to tap kegs of beer, and how

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:50.150
to blend whiskeys together.

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:55.150
Very utilitarian, extremely
influential and it spunned

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:56.540
what I'm going to call
"Jerry's kids."

00:12:56.540 --> 00:13:02.430
You can see the 1876 edition of
the "Bartender's Guide", on

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:06.640
your left you see O.H. Byron's
"Modern Bartender's Guide" and

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.120
C. F. Lawlor's "The
Mixicologist." "Modern

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.450
Bartender", 1884, the Jerry
Thomas in the middle is 1876,

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:15.390
"The Mixicologist"
on the right, I

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:18.540
believe, is around 1891-95.

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.700
There are going to be cocktail
geeks on YouTube, who are

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:24.100
sitting there scolding me for
not knowing my dates, so I'm

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:27.290
just going to make sure and
check my cheat sheet, which

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:28.560
I've created here.

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:32.280
See, yeah, you've got 1894
Byron and 1895 Lawlor.

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.860
And what I call these "Jerry's
kids", these are other

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:36.300
bartenders from other places.

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:39.460
I believe O.H. Byron is New
York, and "The Mixicologist"

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:40.980
was published in Cincinnati.

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:43.920
But these are books that have
very similar gatherings of

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:47.040
recipes, some differences--
you know, we've

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.940
gone another 15 years.

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:52.530
But the "Bartender's Guide"
really hasn't sort of

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:55.450
transformed itself
as a genre yet.

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:58.590
It's still a collection of
recipes with a back appendix

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:01.210
that includes information about
mixing your own syrups

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:03.230
and bitters, and cordials.

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:07.630
Moving on to about 10 years
later, we get the first what

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:12.910
I'm going to call "technical bar
manuals." 1900, the book

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:15.800
on the bottom, Harry Johnson's
"Bartender's Manual." And

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.070
then, I believe, the first
editions of the Hoffman House

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:21.690
were published around 1894,
this one's around 1912.

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:25.240
And you can see the picture of
the guy dashing the bitters,

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:29.800
and the slide says, this is
how you dash a bitter.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.420
One of the reasons why am I
showing you these slides, one

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:34.700
of the things that I was
thinking about when I was

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:38.090
writing the "PDT Cocktail Book"
is how, why write a

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:40.900
cocktail book, unless you're
going to add something new.

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:43.640
And then what is already
out there, what has

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.150
already been written?

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:47.740
And as I started looking through
these old books, it

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:51.930
was interesting to find how,
through each generation, you

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:56.140
sort of saw an evolution, even
in the books themselves.

00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:00.390
The 1862, the 1890s, things are
sort of very formulaic,

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:02.680
they haven't really
evolved yet.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:07.056
And then in 1900 to around 1910
you see books like these.

00:15:07.056 --> 00:15:10.630
These are 300 to 400 page
manuals that tell you how to

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:14.340
write a guest check, how to
hire a porter, how to keep

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:20.750
your walk-in clean; the most
infinitesimal details were all

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:21.780
mentioned in these books.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:23.840
And I thought it was incredibly
interesting,

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.890
because we are right now at a
time, where if I pitched a

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:31.080
book to a major New York
publisher saying, you know I

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.970
want to write a book, and I want
to make sure that there's

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:35.910
a good 20 pages on how to get
the bathrooms cleaned

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:39.490
properly, how to make sure the
garbage gets collected, how to

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:42.450
make sure you know how to hire
a bartender, how to hire a

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:46.080
barback from Mexico and not get
busted by the government.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.900
I want to make sure
and add that in.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.580
The publisher would look at me
and be like, uh, this is

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:52.810
totally disinteresting
and just pass it off.

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:57.190
If you look back 110 years,
there weren't many, but there

00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:59.780
were at least a handful of
these books that were

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:02.900
published and republished, and
popular, because I can still

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:06.680
get my hands on them now for a
lot of money, which is showing

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:11.170
that during this time bartending
is moving into a

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:15.710
craft, is moving into
a valued profession.

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:18.380
People want to read these books,
and the craft of the

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:20.240
cocktail is evolving.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.350
We move forward from there.

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:28.350
This on the left is Kappler,
1895, he bartended at a very

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:30.610
posh hotel called the Holland
House. "Jack's

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:32.780
Manual", that's 1907.

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.330
Dave Wondrich shall be
disappointed, but I don't

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:36.490
remember where Jack worked.

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:41.130
And then on the right is
1908, William Boothby.

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:45.980
I actually have, I think,
I have Boothby up

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:46.840
here to give away.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:53.210
And I have Mr. Johnson up
there to give away.

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:55.580
These are what I'm calling
"the first celebrity bar

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:59.300
books." And as I said before,
we've moved from very sort of

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:03.660
simple recipe books to very
involved professional guides,

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:07.660
to right around 1910, we see
these bartenders who've gone

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:12.020
from just being guys who ran
pubs to being famous.

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:14.710
Many of these bartenders at the
time had travelled around

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:18.400
the country, they had mixed
drinks in numerous posh

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:22.530
hotels, and by now they have not
only their own books, but

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:25.460
they have books that they're not
calling "The Bartender's

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:27.760
Manual" or "How to Mix Drinks",
but they're calling

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:30.710
it "Jack's Manual", or they're
calling it "The World Drinks

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:33.600
and How to Mix Them" and they
got that weird sort of thing

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:37.430
with Boothby, where he is
the standard authority.

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:41.630
But the bartenders kind of by
1910 become a celebrity.

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:46.130
Moving forward to vest pocket
books, which for me, remind me

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:50.350
of the function that PDA sort
of serve for bartenders now.

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:53.130
A lot of times now if you go
to a cocktail bar, and the

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:55.560
bartender doesn't know the
recipe, the first thing

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:58.270
everyone does is they grab their
phone and they start

00:17:58.270 --> 00:17:59.710
Googling, well, I can
find the recipe.

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:02.790
And everyone is on their phone
Googling the recipe.

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:05.720
And following this period
of so much--

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.410
this is the golden age--

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:11.780
"Drinks" from Straub is 1916,
"The ABCs of Mixing Cocktails"

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:15.785
I've actually snuck in English;
book is around 1915.

00:18:15.785 --> 00:18:18.890
It was republished all the
way through the '20s.

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:22.440
"Drinks And How They're Mixed
and Served" by Paul Lowe was

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.730
1904, but was published
for a decade.

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:27.000
And Applegreen's
is around 1916.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.130
So between 1862 and 1916 so many
recipes were created and

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:34.960
the guests were so familiar with
them, that the bartenders

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:38.190
needed these little sort of
cheat sheet books to put in

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:39.040
their vest pocket.

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:41.630
So this would be one of the
sizes of the books, and they

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:43.280
would put them in their
vest pocket.

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:45.150
And someone came to order a
drink, and they didn't know

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:47.880
what it was, they probably did
what most of us do now-- they

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:51.280
sort of go over here and they
started looking through it.

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:56.110
So it's sort of a medieval form
of Google from a hundred

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:58.530
years ago, and it's
interesting.

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:00.620
It's also interesting what I
saw as I was putting this

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:01.800
together for you.

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:05.190
And this is why I took these
photos is if you look at the

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:09.760
trim sizes of all these books,
they're very similar.

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:13.140
This is taken from above,
they're all very similar size.

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:15.110
These are very similar
in size, almost

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:16.520
the same trim size.

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:18.920
Moving forward, now we have this
genre of books that are

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.795
sort of vest pocket books that
come out together all around

00:19:21.795 --> 00:19:24.110
the same 15 years.

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:27.260
And then we move to what I'm
calling "the end of the era".

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:30.100
This is a book I've also
brought to give away.

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:33.290
1917, Hugo Ensslin's "Recipes
for Mixed Drinks." It's

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:36.720
strange, you would think that
the sort of last cocktail book

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:40.160
to come out before the golden
age ended and prohibition was

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:46.450
enacted would be like a plush
Bible that came with, who

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:48.790
knows what, a special box,
but it's a very--

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:51.040
it looks like a very--

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.070
simple book.

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:55.590
But this book by Ensslin, who
was also a New York bartender,

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:59.150
there are at least 50 of his
recipes in a book that came

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:01.460
out later, which will be in one
of my next slides, "The

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:02.760
Savoy Cocktail Book."

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:09.260
And what's interesting, if you
look at Ensslin, 1917, versus

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:14.400
some of the books of the late
1800s, is the sophistication

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:18.550
of the cocktails by 1917
verses the 1860s.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:22.830
This is a time in America
where champagne was--

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:25.920
champagne was around in the
early 1800s, but imagine what

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:30.840
champagne tasted like after it
sat on a horse drawn cart

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:36.190
crossing the West till it got to
the guys digging for gold.

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:39.460
I mean, it probably didn't
have much effervescence.

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:42.650
Who knows how sweet it
was to preserve it?

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:46.970
So this is by 1917, especially
in New York and on the East

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:49.120
Coast, you have all these
interesting European

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:52.130
ingredients from all over the
world, and all of them were

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:53.220
going into the cocktails.

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:56.550
And the cocktails of this that
are in this book and they come

00:20:56.550 --> 00:21:00.710
from this era are some of the
most sophisticated that have

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:01.920
ever been created.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:04.600
But as I said, it's the
end of the era.

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:08.080
One of the popular myths is
that prohibition was this

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:12.980
great time to drink in America,
and it wasn't.

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:16.260
When prohibition was enacted,
there was about a year, year

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.590
and a half for people who
had a lot of money

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:19.510
to stock their cellar.

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:21.900
And some of them who really did
have a lot of money put as

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.820
much as they possibly
could in there.

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:28.570
But for most people, they
couldn't afford to save up for

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:29.430
the end of the world.

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:33.460
So as they ran out of booze,
and then pretty soon you're

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.600
either buying booze from
gangsters or you're buying

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:41.230
booze from someone who's bring
it illegally off of a clipper.

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:43.210
A lot of these people who were
selling the booze were

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:46.750
criminals in it of themselves,
they could not be trusted.

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:49.375
They were adulterating a lot of
the spirits, cutting them.

00:21:49.375 --> 00:21:55.390
You certainly weren't mixing
with some of these finer

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:58.880
cordials and liqueurs, and
bitters that you could get

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.540
when booze was still legal.

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:04.160
And drinking was illegal, so you
had to do it quietly, you

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:05.650
had to do it discreetly.

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:10.110
And the great bartenders of the
golden age from 1890 to

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:14.270
1916 they either quick
bartending or they left.

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:17.290
They went to Cuba, they went
to Tijuana, they went to

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:19.120
Paris, they went to London.

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.180
They went somewhere else, where
their skills could be

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:24.400
used, they could
work in hotels.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:27.260
And what we saw happen during
this time, which is

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:30.760
interesting, is these sort of
prohibition era guides.

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:34.260
Here's how "Noble Experiments",
there's another

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:39.580
one called "Giggle Water." And
the pub dates, the pub dates

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:42.740
for these books are--

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:44.150
"Here's How" is 1927--

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:48.180
so that's on 1919 and 1933
roughly is prohibition--

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:51.240
so that's towards the end .
"Noble Experiments" is 1930,

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.640
"Giggle Watter" is 1928.

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:58.310
So this is people, whose stash
has run dry, there's recipes

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:01.590
for how to compound different
spirits in there.

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:05.210
The recipes have gone from
these very sort of

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:08.320
sophisticated cocktails from
Ensslin to sort of going more

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:11.520
towards the Screwdriver, or
more towards the Bronx.

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:12.740
This is a period--

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:14.860
and the other thing you'll
notice about the trim size,

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:17.190
you can't tell by this, but
the "here's how" books are

00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:19.620
also really small.

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:25.370
And this is a period, where
books go from being books

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:30.460
written by bartenders for
bartenders to books written by

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:32.090
who knows who-- because they
don't want to put their name

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:34.780
on it, because it's
prohibition--

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:39.430
for people, who are basically
hosting these illegal parties,

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:40.910
going to speakeasies,
and want to know a

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:42.050
little more about it.

00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:45.700
And the content has really left
the realm, the cocktail

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:48.710
guide has really left the realm
of the bartender and has

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:54.070
moved into the realm of the
amateur or the host.

00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:57.710
Moving forward from here what,
as I said before, these great

00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:01.340
bartenders in New York, or in
San Francisco, or in Chicago

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:04.690
and New Orleans, in Cincinnati,
who wanted to

00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:07.900
continue their trade left and
they move on. "The Cafe Royal

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:11.160
Cocktail Book", 1937,
is from London.

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.020
The 1930 "The Savoy Cocktail
Book" on the right, which is

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.430
still in print, and the one in
the middle, "The Artistry of

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:20.910
Mixing Drinks" by Frank Meier,
around 1937 as well.

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:25.920
These are the house cocktail
books of three amazing bars.

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:30.590
"The Cafe Royal" and "The Savoy"
were sort of UKBG--

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:32.540
the United Kingdom
Bartender Guild.

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:36.930
These were sort of their house
bibles in many ways, their

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:38.980
sort of Jerry Thomases.

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:42.530
And what happened thankfully for
the cocktail globally is

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:45.050
that a lot of the best drinks,
drinks like you saw in

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:47.790
Ensslin, move right
over to Europe.

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:49.060
And these are--

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:51.720
I have a couple of these--

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:54.890
I think I have one of these
somewhere to give you guys--

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:56.520
but these books are amazing.

00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:00.390
And this is when you really see
the books go from being

00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:03.460
Jerry Thomas' "Bartender's
Guide" to being books about

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:06.060
the places that drinks
came from.

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:11.550
Moving forward, post
prohibition, in my opinion,

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:14.910
things start tapering off,
they get kind of sad.

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:19.690
"The Stork Club Cocktail Book",
1946, "The Old Waldorf

00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:24.090
Bar Book", 1935, and Crosby
Gaige's "Cocktail Guide And

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:27.670
Ladies' Companion"
in the middle.

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:30.840
I think Crosby Gaige might
have been gay.

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:35.800
But these are books, they were
written by journalists after

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.010
prohibition.

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:39.900
And it's interesting, as I said
before, we've gone from

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:44.150
sort of the bar manual being
always authored by bartenders

00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:48.050
to the bar manual through
prohibition and all these sort

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:51.190
of nifty little gifty guides,
being something that is now

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:53.260
not written by bartenders
anymore.

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:56.680
They're written by hosts,
they're written by men or

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.110
women among town.

00:25:58.110 --> 00:26:01.080
And they are written not for
bartenders to make good drinks

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.900
in bars, but they're written
for the host to sort of

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:06.750
continue their roaring
'20s parties into

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:08.660
the '30s and '40s.

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:11.140
The thing that you will find,
and then moving forward, "The

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:15.010
Didactic Bartender", 1934, "The
Official Mixer's Manual"

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:20.070
by Patrick Gavin Duffy and
1945-51 Townsend's

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:23.760
"Bartender's Book." This is when
these kind of crotchety

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:29.340
bartenders who had been part of
the golden age and ridden

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:34.235
out through prohibition, they
see what's going on and

00:26:34.235 --> 00:26:35.150
they're disgusted.

00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:41.570
And what these books that you'll
find from 1934 to 1955

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:44.220
are written with the bartenders
are basically

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:47.210
telling the young bartenders
about how they used to walk

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:50.270
through the snow, and how long
it took to get to school; and

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:53.010
then they want them to stop
making drinks with orange

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:55.210
juice and drinks with cream,
they want them to go back to

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:56.130
the classics.

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:58.480
They want them to learn the
classics first and then they

00:26:58.480 --> 00:26:59.400
can move forward.

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:04.620
But it's almost like the
bartender has lost the ability

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:08.240
to command an audience
anymore.

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.910
People are not as interested
in cocktails

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:11.180
as they were before.

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:13.870
America does not have
the same spirits.

00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:16.650
We're in the middle
of two world wars.

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:18.430
People are drinking what they're
drinking to get drunk.

00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:21.930
They're not drinking because
the economy and because the

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:24.260
country is on the up and up.

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:27.620
So I call these "the didactic
bartender guides."

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:29.070
And then we move forward to--

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:32.910
I know, this is going to
end, guys, hold on--

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:34.940
cocktail theory.

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:38.160
The first cocktail theory book
"The Fine Art of Mixing

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:40.405
Drinks" by David Embury, was not
written by a bartender, it

00:27:40.405 --> 00:27:42.360
was written by a lawyer.

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:46.540
It's about 700 pages, incredibly
dry and acerbic.

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:49.800
David Embury liked his cocktail
with a lot of booze,

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.900
a little bit of sour,
and almost no sugar.

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:58.140
And this is where we move into
the Mad Men era, hard-drinking

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:01.340
men, in the seven-to-one
Martini.

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:03.110
Who knows where the
bartender is.

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:06.875
And I included a book that came
out in 2003, "The Joy of

00:28:06.875 --> 00:28:10.260
Mixology", because this is the
second theoretical bar book.

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:12.420
And then we move,
essentially--

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:15.620
I'm not sure how many people
you've heard talk about the

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:16.540
history of the cocktail--

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:18.660
but the cocktail really pretty
much goes into the

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:21.020
toilet by the 1950s.

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:23.860
It's highballs, it's
old fashions.

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:25.970
I think that maybe the Patrick
Gavin Duffys of the

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:28.470
world got their day.

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:30.490
And the drinks, they're
not very interesting.

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:34.280
They're dry, they're strong,
they get the ad men through.

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:35.610
Once again, we're at war.

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:37.640
And then pretty much, if you
want to find anything about

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:40.810
cocktails, you've got to look
at books like "The Complete

00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:42.540
Book of Drink" by
T.E. Carling, or

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:43.730
these Grossman's guides.

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:48.170
And the cocktail book has
taken away from the bon

00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:51.690
vivance and taken away from the
sort of "gay happy hosts",

00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:53.640
and move towards the English.

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:58.970
And things become very
analytical and dry.

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:02.700
And then we move forward to the
absolute darkest point of

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.310
the cocktail--

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:06.440
the 1970s.

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:07.787
There's two cocktail
books that I'd

00:29:07.787 --> 00:29:08.990
recommend from the 1970s.

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:12.440
One is Stan Jones' "Complete
Bar Guide" from 1977.

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:15.650
And I've put another book here
from 2010 "Diffordsguide",

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:16.410
which I do recommend.

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:17.870
I recommend both these books.

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:20.410
And once again, I want you to
look at these books sitting

00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:23.280
right next to each other,
because these books are very

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:27.360
much those kitchen sink time
books that have thousands of

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:28.460
recipes in them.

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:33.550
And they both actually have
around the same trim size.

00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:36.920
As we're going through all the
possible genres of cocktail

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:39.320
books, that I could possibly
think of writing, when I'm

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:42.660
thinking, what should I write,
if I write a cocktail book?

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:46.440
The autobiography is
actually an option.

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:51.450
In the 1950s, Johnny Brooks
wrote "My 35 Years Behind

00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:54.830
Bars." He claims that he created
the Between the Sheets

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:59.250
cocktail, a beguiling mixture
of gin and lemon, and brandy

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:00.970
and Cuantro.

00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:03.900
Also very dry, something that
could certainly get someone

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:06.580
who wasn't paying attention to
what they're drinking between

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:08.220
the sheets.

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:11.680
And then a book by my friend
Toby Checchini "Cosmopolitan".

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:13.110
Toby wrote this book in 2003.

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:16.110
And I consider it to very much
be the sort of kitchen

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:19.025
confidential of the
bartending world.

00:30:19.025 --> 00:30:21.910
Anthony Bourdain wrote this
great book about being a chef

00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:25.040
that basically involves nothing
but parties and drugs,

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:25.980
m girls in the walk-in.

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:31.720
And that's sort of Toby's
basically follow-up to that.

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:33.960
I'm sad to inform many of you
who are thinking of leaving

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:37.490
your excellent job at Google,
but that is not the way

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:40.242
bartending really is.

00:30:40.242 --> 00:30:41.360
And then we--

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.590
we're getting there, guys--

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:45.130
we move to what I'm calling
"the modern giants".

00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:49.700
These are my modern follow-up
100 years later from those

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:50.900
celebrity cocktail books.

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:54.290
You have "Cocktail Technique" on
your left, written by Kazuo

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:57.520
Uyeda, the founder of the
hardshake method.

00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:59.970
The hardshake method for all
of you cocktail geeks-- you

00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:02.600
probably know about this, but
for those of you who don't--

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:06.410
it's a method of shaking, using
a cobbler shaker, that

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:10.980
has become very popular
among the YouTube set.

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:14.470
If you go to a bar and you see
someone shaking like this, and

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:17.240
they look very Japanese, they've
probably been watching

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:21.050
Kazuo Uyeda do this three-point
method shake.

00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:22.780
Greg Boehm has actually
translated this

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:23.960
book, and it's excellent.

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:26.620
You have "The Craft of the
Cocktail" in the middle, Dale

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:30.770
DeGroff, the sort of Yoda and
tree trunk of American

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:33.450
cocktails, wrote that in 2002.

00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:35.800
I have Charles Schumann's
"American Bar".

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:38.920
Ironically, Charles Schumann
is from Munich.

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:41.300
He has a bar, called Schumann's,
which has been

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:43.710
around for at least 25 years.

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:47.100
He's one of the most elegant,
charismatic, and interesting

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:48.520
bartenders on earth.

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:50.900
And his book "American Bar",
written by a German, was a

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:52.520
huge influence on my book.

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:55.270
And then down below there you
have the "Cocktails of the

00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:59.050
Ritz Paris", written by Colin
Field, an Englishman, who has

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:01.580
been bartending at the Ritz in
Paris, which is now closed for

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:04.250
a couple years, for
over 20 years.

00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:07.390
So we have the modern giants
in the cocktail technique.

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:11.330
We have a book that is very
much one of those Harry

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:12.960
Johnson "Hoffman House" books.

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:16.100
It's very technical, very
informative, as far as what

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:17.970
he's thinking when he
makes a cocktail.

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:20.260
We have "The Cocktails of the
Ritz Paris", which is sort of

00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:22.830
a reprise of "The House Cocktail
Book." In "American

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:26.350
Bar", we have a little bit of
everything, which is what I

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:27.330
ended up going for.

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:30.200
And in "Craft of the Cocktail",
we have a coffee

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:33.610
table book filled with great
recipes and photographs.

00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:36.830
And in my opinion, if you read
"Craft" closely, you'll see a

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:40.630
bit of that sort of Patrick
Gavin Duffy, sort of "let's

00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:42.750
bring it back, guys".

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:47.250
And moving forward we have this
whole genre now of what

00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:49.610
Dave Wondrich calls
"mixography".

00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:53.950
And this is, guys, once again,
going back to the 1940s.

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:56.720
These are guys that know way
too much, they have way too

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.070
many college degrees.

00:32:58.070 --> 00:33:02.100
And instead of studying whatever
you do to get PhDs,

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:03.740
they decide, I'll write
a cocktail book.

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:07.260
So in the 1980s, I
believe, Lowell

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:09.020
Edmunds wrote "Martini".

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:12.150
He is a classics professor,
I believe, somewhere in a

00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:13.500
college in New Jersey.

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:18.710
In 2004-05, forgive me, Dave,
Dave Wondrich wrote "Imbibe".

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:22.960
Dave Wondrich also has a Ph.D.
In early English literature, I

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.200
believe, in Comp. lit.

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:27.230
William Grimes, "Straight
Up or on the Rocks".

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:29.280
I think he wrote that in 1993.

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:31.530
I remember reading
that as a college

00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:33.730
bartender in Madison, Wisconsin.

00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:36.690
At this time I was serving
cocktails and orange juice

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:39.020
from the soda gun, a lot
of Alabama Slammers,

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:40.905
Long Island Iced Teas.

00:33:40.905 --> 00:33:43.750
My idea with molecular mythology
was a cement mixer,

00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:46.850
which is Bailey's with a little
bit of Rose's lime--

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:49.630
stick a straw in it--

00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:51.700
snake bites, the whole
nine yards.

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:54.030
And I remember reading that book
when I was in college,

00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:56.220
and being like, this is so
boring, who would want to

00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:58.020
drink in a hotel bar?

00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:00.220
It's actually a pretty
good book.

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:05.560
2005 or 2006, Ted Haigh, set
designer, who actually has

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:09.690
done the set design for
the latest series

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:10.679
of "Boardwalk Empire".

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:12.600
Ted's based out of LA.

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:15.479
This book is brilliant,
well illustrated.

00:34:15.479 --> 00:34:17.760
It's called "Vintage Spirits and
Forgotten Cocktails", and

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:21.600
it's really one of the books
that is most responsible for

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:24.449
the return of lot of these old
sort of weird spirits they go

00:34:24.449 --> 00:34:27.164
in cocktails that come out
of books like this.

00:34:27.164 --> 00:34:32.870
And on the bottom "The Grog
Log", an early '90s book by

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:37.179
tiki guru named Jeff Berry,
who has spent the last 20

00:34:37.179 --> 00:34:40.770
years trying to find out what
people like Trader Vic and Don

00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:43.880
Beach were putting in these
very potent and delicious

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:47.880
cocktails that ruled
the '40s and '50s.

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.010
Last--

00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:51.250
almost, guys, we're
getting there--

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:52.679
the coffee table book.

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:56.420
This is "Speakeasy" by Jay and
Dusham of Employees Only.

00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:59.870
Certainly, there have been a
number of others that I could

00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:00.970
have put up here.

00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:04.470
But what I've found in the last
ten years, as I said,

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:06.280
thinking about what I'm going
to write my cocktail book

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:11.750
about, is that the people buying
bartender books from

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:14.580
the publishers, were used to
buying books from chefs.

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:17.380
And they were used to not
writing professional bar

00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:20.090
guides, they were used to
writing books that were sort

00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:22.680
of something you could-- it had
a Manhattan and a Martini,

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:25.440
and a Margarita, and was sort
of light and lively, and

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:27.440
something that you could put
on your coffee table.

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:32.780
This is a great book, but it
wasn't what I wanted to write.

00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:36.330
Another book that I've actually
edited for the last

00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:40.350
1, 2, 3,4, 5, 6 7 years is "The
Food and Wine Cocktail

00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:44.040
Book." When I started working on
this book, after Rob Willie

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:49.040
left, it was just a kind of
collection of all sorts of old

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:49.620
cocktail books.

00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:54.170
And what I found in 2005-2006,
when I started, there was this

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:56.300
sort of-- as I said before, I
started working at the Pegu

00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:57.790
Club in 2005.

00:35:57.790 --> 00:36:00.080
And I felt like what was going
on all over the country was

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:02.456
absolutely unlike anything
that had gone

00:36:02.456 --> 00:36:03.520
in the history before.

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:07.000
And I found for the last seven
years that I can use this book

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.890
with my editor Kate Krader and
the editors of Food and Wine

00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:14.190
to actually document what's
going on year after year.

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:16.490
So our latest edition
just came out.

00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:17.570
The other ones are around.

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:21.970
And it's kind of a neat way to
follow what is out there.

00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:23.610
And then last--

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:26.090
actually not even last,
but not least--

00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:30.460
is the "PDT Cocktail Book", a
book I wrote in 2011, a book

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:33.260
some of you, guys, probably have
in your hand, and maybe

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:34.270
even pacing through it.

00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:37.320
What I wanted to do when
I wrote this book--

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:39.310
and I promise I'm going to open
this up for some dialogue

00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:40.360
in one second--

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:44.880
is write a book that brought
back the 1930s book, brought

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:46.780
back illustrations instead
of photos.

00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:49.570
I wanted a book that didn't
just have recipes, but had

00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:50.880
recipes that had a story.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:54.010
I feel like cocktails tell a
story, and I wanted the drinks

00:36:54.010 --> 00:36:55.410
in this book to tell a story.

00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:57.190
For that reason the
illustrations in the book

00:36:57.190 --> 00:37:00.500
aren't illustrations of me
making cocktails at PDT, but

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:05.760
they're illustrations that
document maybe the playfulness

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:06.690
of the cocktail.

00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:10.910
I wanted a book that had an
annotated bibliography, that

00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:14.870
not only showed you where I
found these recipes, but where

00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:16.920
you can look for more.

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:19.170
I wanted a book that had
the food recipes in the

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:21.720
back, and on and on.

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:24.510
There's one more cocktail book
that I want to show you, one

00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:27.550
more format of cocktail book
I want to show you before I

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:29.200
start opening things up
for conversation.

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:31.065
If you guys could
play the video.

00:37:34.485 --> 00:37:34.980
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:54.380
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:57.700
-The best bartenders in the
world realize that there's a

00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:01.140
sense of nobility to
serving people.

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:03.190
-So this is some of the
different ice that we use here

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:04.850
at Little Branch.

00:38:04.850 --> 00:38:08.040
We use a hand-cut enormous
rock of ice.

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:10.590
When you have a drink sitting
on that, it will dilute much

00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:13.150
more slowly, so you can sit
there and sip your drink,

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:15.230
without it turning into
a watery mess.

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:17.610
-If you have lime juice, or if
you have eggs, or if you have

00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:20.130
cream, and it's already a cloudy
drink, that's usually

00:38:20.130 --> 00:38:24.340
the decision maker between
whether we stir or shake.

00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:26.860
-And the fun part, we're going
to give it an orange twist.

00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:29.000
And in this case, a flamed
orange twist.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.460
You always want to use
a nice fresh orange

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:33.435
with a shiny skin.

00:38:33.435 --> 00:38:36.710
-Sea salt tends to clump around
the edge of the glass,

00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:39.715
whereas kosher salt gives
you this nice fine rim.

00:38:39.715 --> 00:39:05.490
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:06.630
-This is the Irish Coffee.

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:10.290
You can use the coffee of your
choice, two brown sugar cubes,

00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:11.970
and just give them a crush.

00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:13.630
Irish whiskey is the
traditional.

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:16.460
A little bit of hot water,
and just float it

00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:18.360
on top, mint leaf.

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:20.520
And that is an Irish Coffee.

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:21.280
-Caipirinha.

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:22.080
-Tom Collins.

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:23.070
-Daiquiri.

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:23.910
-Sazerac.

00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:24.560
-The Mojito.

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:24.965
-Gin &amp; Tonic.

00:39:24.965 --> 00:39:26.215
-Pisco Sour.

00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:32.620
[END OF VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:36.030
JIM MEEHAN: This is an app that
I did right after I was

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:38.460
working on the "PDT Cocktail
Book." It came out right

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:41.160
before the "PDT Cocktail Book"
came out, so I couldn't really

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:42.000
do much to promote it.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.720
But it's a book that
is all digital.

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:47.870
And it's so hard to explain to
someone how to stir a drink,

00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:50.990
but when you have a video of it,
it's completely different.

00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:52.960
It's a new format of
cocktail book.

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:55.330
And I guess what I'll leave
you with before I take a

00:39:55.330 --> 00:39:58.030
couple questions, because I know
we're running late, is

00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:01.110
the future of cocktail books,
I think, is going to depend

00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:04.980
heavily on the technology that
you guys are working on, on

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:09.410
the way that we search for
everything, and how we display

00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:11.000
information.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.350
I would argue that
it's so much--

00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:16.790
I prefer, for instance, having
something that I can hand

00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:20.750
someone, something that I can
touch, something that I can

00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:21.440
refer to it.

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:23.280
And when I wrote this book, I
didn't think bartenders would

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:24.970
still keep it behind the bar.

00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:27.060
I figured that everything
was moving towards apps.

00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:28.740
And thankfully, that
hasn't happened.

00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:31.850
But I would argue to all of you
that there's really never

00:40:31.850 --> 00:40:33.990
been a better time to drink.

00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:36.490
The information out there--

00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:37.740
especially after the seminar--

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:43.280
and knowing that, and knowing
that there's so much

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:45.910
information out there, and that
this information is being

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:49.270
accessed by people all the
world, it's kind of up to you,

00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:51.220
guys, for how they'll use it.

00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:54.530
And I guess the question I have
is, as I talked about in

00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:57.910
the beginning, walking you
through the journey that I

00:40:57.910 --> 00:41:00.300
went on, looking through all
these old cocktail books.

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:02.640
Before I weighed in what was
good about them, or what I

00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:05.240
didn't like about them, and
decided what I wanted to

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:06.980
write, when I wrote
my own book.

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:11.490
How can the search that we use
on a daily basis, many, many

00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:15.150
times a day, maybe evolve or
change so that you can see a

00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:18.900
little bit of how you find
information, instead of just

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:21.710
getting to that information.

00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:24.810
So I'll leave that
to you guys.

00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:26.420
No pressure.

00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:28.830
Do you guys have
many questions?

00:41:28.830 --> 00:41:29.230
Complaints?

00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:30.970
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:32.220
JIM MEEHAN: Thank you.

00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:39.130
AUDIENCE: We've got a
question over there.

00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:40.326
JIM MEEHAN: Yeah.

00:41:40.326 --> 00:41:41.820
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:46.302
that I had in mind [INAUDIBLE],
but for

00:41:46.302 --> 00:41:49.190
everything that's come out
in 2013 and end of 2012.

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:50.720
What do you see as
sticking around?

00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:55.870
What do you see as going to
be passe in a year or so?

00:41:55.870 --> 00:41:57.830
JIM MEEHAN: I think that, what's
interesting is we live

00:41:57.830 --> 00:41:59.130
in New York.

00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:04.750
So what's happening here will
come and go quickly, because

00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:08.950
our interest cycle here is--

00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:10.730
one of the things I realized
working with the New York

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:13.940
media is that really all they
write about, God bless them

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:15.200
is-- what's new and
what's hot.

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:18.940
So if you want to remain in the
media and become popular,

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:20.240
you have to constantly evolve.

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:24.170
So it's hard to say in the
bigger picture how long some

00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:25.850
of these things will
stay around.

00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:29.940
I think, at the end
of the day, people

00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:31.800
buy with their eyes.

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:34.860
And also people are impatient.

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:38.210
So the beautiful things, the
things that involve the

00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:42.620
ceremony, the things that create
cocktails, where a

00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:45.510
guest watches the bartender make
the drink, and then the

00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:47.980
glass goes to the guest, and
then everyone looks at that

00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:50.210
guest and says, I want that.

00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:52.330
And then the guest actually
likes that drink.

00:42:52.330 --> 00:42:54.530
Those will be the things
that stay around.

00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:57.810
I think that the reason why
people go out for drinks,

00:42:57.810 --> 00:43:00.170
instead of making them for
themselves in their home, is

00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:01.710
because they want to
see and be seen.

00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:03.800
Even if they want to
do it discretely.

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:06.820
So I think that if you apply
that logic to some of the

00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:08.330
trends that are going on.

00:43:08.330 --> 00:43:10.950
If it's delicious, if it allows
you to see and be seen,

00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:13.400
if it's efficient, I think
it'll stay around.

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:16.430
CREW MEMBER: Please use the
microphones for your questions

00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:17.340
because we are recording.

00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:17.580
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:18.640
All right.

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:21.790
My question is, I guess I feel
like, when I was a kid, I

00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:24.020
couldn't walk in a grocery store
and find an avocado.

00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:25.890
I'd probably had never
even seen one.

00:43:25.890 --> 00:43:28.520
So as the world's become much
more global, and we have

00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:31.200
access to all different things
from all around the world, how

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:36.320
has that changed the kind of
drinks that people are, I

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:38.970
guess, experimenting with or
designing, or whatever--

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:42.030
JIM MEEHAN: Yeah, I mean I
think that it depends on

00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:42.640
where you're at.

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:46.690
For instance, in San Francisco,
the mentality about

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:49.070
what ingredients they work with
is different than the

00:43:49.070 --> 00:43:51.460
mentality, say, that we
work with in New York.

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:55.710
New York is as close to Europe
as we are to San Francisco.

00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:58.320
So I find that, depending on
which part of the world you're

00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:01.470
in, you'll see different
trends for how they use

00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:02.250
ingredients.

00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:05.720
For instance, in Copenhagen with
Noman, the sort of new

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:08.760
Nordic cuisine, you'll see a
different more locavore sense,

00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:11.150
whereas in New York or in
London, you'll probably see

00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:15.690
more of interchangeable global
sense; San Fransisco--

00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:17.460
more local and sustainable.

00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:21.790
But I think that in general, as
I said before, it's making

00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:23.560
drinks I think more
interesting.

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:27.520
And one of the reasons why I've
been able to remain as

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:29.770
interested as I am in cocktails,
is because

00:44:29.770 --> 00:44:33.570
cocktails have like an
anthropology to them.

00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:38.720
So you can follow the of this
is agave-based, so I'm going

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:40.200
to use an agave-based
sweetener.

00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:44.280
And jabanero peppers are sort of
things you find in Mexico.

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:48.120
So it's sort of the more you
look at it, I think, the more

00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:49.690
interesting it becomes.

00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:54.470
I had a reporter recently come
to me at a charity event a

00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:56.200
couple nights ago and said,
so what are the

00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:57.450
latest trends in cocktails?

00:44:57.450 --> 00:45:01.450
What a lot of people around here
are saying is that we're

00:45:01.450 --> 00:45:04.760
going back to the basics,
more simple cocktails.

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:08.190
And one of the secret I'll tell
you about most bartenders

00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:10.380
is most of them are
pretty lazy.

00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:18.120
So, of course, there is an
incentive to keep it simple.

00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:21.270
But I think that the more you
see avocados in cocktails, the

00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:24.650
more you see these sort of
interesting and esoteric

00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:27.650
cocktails, that maybe involve
things that you didn't expect

00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:30.410
or never desired to be in your
drinks, it's what makes going

00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:32.285
out to drink interesting
to me.

00:45:32.285 --> 00:45:33.910
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:36.270
AUDIENCE: So, first
of all, PDT was my

00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:38.870
first Speakeasy, so--

00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:39.970
JIM MEEHAN: We never meant
to be a Speakeasy,

00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:40.930
but I'll take that.

00:45:40.930 --> 00:45:41.760
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:44.320
but going through the phone
booth, and doing that whole

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:46.400
kind of thing was a really
awesome introduction.

00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:47.380
So thank you for that.

00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:48.760
JIM MEEHAN: No, thank you.

00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:50.780
AUDIENCE: So one thing I want
to ask is so the next time I

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:54.670
go, what should I get in terms
of cocktail plus deep fried

00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:56.760
hot dog pairing?

00:45:56.760 --> 00:46:00.290
And a follow-up, how
do I get in?

00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:01.820
JIM MEEHAN: I do have a limited
amount of business

00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:03.380
cards, which you could probably
auction off after

00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:06.300
some of you go to
your meetings.

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:09.445
But, yeah, I think the way that
the menu is set up at

00:46:09.445 --> 00:46:13.080
PDT, is I came from a wine
background before I focused on

00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:16.120
cocktails, so the list goes
from light, refreshing,

00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:19.060
usually white spirit drinks,
moving onto to sours, moving

00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:21.300
onto stirred and strong drinks,
sometimes rich drinks

00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:22.130
in the winter.

00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:24.320
So the idea is to drink
through it.

00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:25.630
The idea of what we're
doing trying to

00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:27.590
do is course cocktails.

00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:31.400
So in an ideal situation, like
an ideal PDT experience for me

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:33.460
is you start out with something
light an dry,

00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:37.430
something like a Paddington,
which is a sort of Daiquiri

00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:40.330
variation with Marmalade
and absinth.

00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:43.760
You move into something that's
maybe a touch stronger, a

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:46.410
touch sweeter, maybe a
touch more bitter.

00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:48.680
And then you finish off with
something brown and stirred,

00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:49.970
like the Benton's
Old Fashioned.

00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:51.300
She'll send the kids
to college.

00:46:54.046 --> 00:46:56.950
As far as the food, one of the
things people always say, so

00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:59.190
what hot dog should I have
with what cocktail?

00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:01.760
And really the food is there, if
you have too many of these

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:03.610
cocktails, you're going
to have to stop

00:47:03.610 --> 00:47:04.480
having these cocktails.

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:11.370
So the food is really there to
sustain you and fortify you as

00:47:11.370 --> 00:47:14.580
you sip your way through
my menu.

00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:17.040
We have the Chang dog with the
kimchi, so as long as you're

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:20.180
not on a date, I highly
recommend that.

00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:22.800
The Torres tots, I recommend
everyone gets that.

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:26.530
That's Sue Torres from Suenos,
all these amazing Mexican

00:47:26.530 --> 00:47:27.710
ingredients on top.

00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:30.080
Well, we have the mission
Chinese dog, which has a

00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:32.710
little bit of Sichuan pepper,
so it's a little numbing, as

00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:34.190
long as that doesn't
bother you.

00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:37.050
And then we have the wily dog,
which is, as I've said on the

00:47:37.050 --> 00:47:39.910
menu, this from wd~50,
the dogs go

00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:41.220
molecular before the drinks.

00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:47.100
So they're all there to please
you and help you gain weight,

00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:48.550
and keep you drinking.

00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:50.220
So it's your choice.

00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:51.230
And what I told--

00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:52.750
AUDIENCE: Is that what the
deep-fried mayo is for?

00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:55.070
JIM MEEHAN: Deep-fried
mayo is to keep you

00:47:55.070 --> 00:47:57.640
large, living large.

00:47:57.640 --> 00:47:59.250
But what I tell my
staff is that

00:47:59.250 --> 00:48:01.320
ideally we want to serve--

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:04.110
we spend so much time keeping
this menu up-to-date--

00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:06.580
that we want to serve you
the drinks on this menu.

00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:09.675
A lot of times cocktail geeks
will go to a bar and they be

00:48:09.675 --> 00:48:11.020
like, so what can I
get off the menu?

00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:13.710
And it's just like, what we're
trying to do, what we spend

00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:15.060
all of our time on this menu.

00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:17.490
So we do want you to try
the drinks on the menu.

00:48:17.490 --> 00:48:19.920
If none of them sound
appetizing, we generally defer

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:22.080
to old PDT cocktails
or the classics.

00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:23.820
So I mean that's sort
of our procedure.

00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:26.710
You could walk in, just like you
do at Milk&amp;Honey and say,

00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:28.720
I want something brown
and stirred.

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:30.310
I want something with tequila.

00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:32.660
I love the Diablo, or whatever
your favorite drink is, and

00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:34.600
then they should be able to
help you with that too.

00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:37.410
So I think what we'll do for
those of you that can possibly

00:48:37.410 --> 00:48:40.820
stay longer or drink more is I
will find one of the-- we'll

00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:43.210
reposition one of these tables
for those of you who bought a

00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:44.970
book and want me to
sign it still.

00:48:44.970 --> 00:48:48.070
And you get a shot of Mezcal as
soon as I sign your book.

00:48:48.070 --> 00:48:49.520
How do you feel about that?

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:50.050
Sound good?

00:48:50.050 --> 00:48:51.010
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:52.020
JIM MEEHAN: Thank you,
guys, very much.

00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:53.520
I really appreciate your time.

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:54.770
CREW MEMBER: Thank
you, Jim Meehan.
