00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.100
- [Instructor] What we are
going to do in this video

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.420
is discuss the United States Senate.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.450
We're gonna focus not only areas

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.310
where the Senate has special influence,

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.560
where the House of
Representatives does not,

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.150
but we'll also focus on

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.550
how the Senate actually conducts business.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.120
As we'll see the processes

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.060
and the rules that the Senate uses,

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.080
makes it more difficult
for simple majority

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.740
to do what they want.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.940
So in terms of special influence,

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.690
only the Senate, not the
House of Representatives,

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.480
is involved in ratifying treaties.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.100
The executive, the President,

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.950
they can negotiate a treaty

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.890
but it does not become effective binding

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.790
from a United States point of view

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.790
until it is ratified by
the United States Senate,

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.310
and it has to be ratified
by a 2/3 super majority.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.520
This is one of the
reasons why it is viewed

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.510
that the Senate has more
influence on foreign relations

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.810
than the House of Representatives.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.860
The other area that the Senate is involved

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.400
is in confirming appointments.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.700
These could be appointments
to the President's cabinet.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.690
These could also be
judiciary appointments.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.320
It could be to lower federal courts

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.680
or to the United States Supreme Court.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.180
The House of Representatives
once again is not involved.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.940
But to appreciate just how things

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.060
go through the Senate,

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.490
whether we're talking about appointments

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.010
or even if we're talking
about general legislation,

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.600
let's remind ourselves
the overall process.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.140
So let's just say that this
is a piece of legislation,

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.470
right over here.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.800
It could have been drafted
by a staffer for a senator,

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.030
maybe with help from some constituents

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.800
or from some special interest groups

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.970
and maybe some lobbyist,

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.170
and it will be introduced to
an appropriate committee by

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.200
a senator or by a group of senators.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.940
For example, if this legislation

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.320
is about the Armed Services,

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.800
it would go to the Armed
Services Committee.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.680
The committee could decide
to have some hearings

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.600
around the legislation.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.760
Maybe they bring in the
Secretary of Defense.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.730
Maybe they bring in some military leaders.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.950
And ask them questions about their views

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.050
about whether the legislation
is a good idea or not,

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.210
or they just want general context.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.830
Then, they might also have some debate.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.870
Then they might decide

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.390
to vote

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.280
on that legislation.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.610
If that vote passes,

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.600
if they get a majority in that committee,

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.810
then it will go to the Senate

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.140
floor.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.170
Before we even talk about what happens

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.770
on the floor of the Senate,

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.010
because that's where things
get really interesting,

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.610
it's important to point out
that even within committee,

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.430
the leadership has a lot of influence

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.480
and the leadership is generally controlled

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.070
by the majority party.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.660
Because the leadership might decide

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.970
that hey you know what, they're
not interested in this bill,

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.450
so instead of going
through this process here,

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.010
they might just decide to table the bill

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.909
which kind of just puts it into a limbo.

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:48.770
But let's talk about the reality

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.280
where it does get voted on.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.830
It does get a majority and
it goes to the Senate floor.

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.850
What's going to happen
next in the Senate floor

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.560
is a debate

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.470
over that bill, and I'm
writing debate in caps

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.610
because the Senate is
famous for its debates.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.630
The whole idea of ending a
debate so that you can vote

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.450
is critical inside of the Senate.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.380
Once you get to the vote,

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.920
if we're talking about a
general piece of legislation,

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.170
if we're talking about an appointment,

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.970
then you just need a simple majority.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.000
So you just need 51 votes to pass.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.970
Some of you might say, hold on a second,

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.620
I've always heard that at the Senate,

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.640
in order to do anything,
so need a super majority.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.100
You might have heard the 60 vote number.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.730
The reason why you hear
that is because many times

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.530
the folks who do not wanna have a vote

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:34.840
especially if they think that the vote

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.120
is going to go against them,

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.050
that one senator or it
could be a group of senators

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.180
that say, hey, I want
to keep debating on it,

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.360
and this protracted debate
is known as a filibuster,

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.550
which is a very strange word.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.210
It was originally in reference to pirates

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.690
but it came to mean folks
who were trying to hold up

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.350
to the legislation process.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.280
Its become a mechanism by which

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.580
the folks who don't want the vote,

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.840
who might be against the bill,
who might be in the minority,

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.330
they might not have enough
votes to defeat the bill

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.800
might still try to hold things up.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.850
The reason why you heard about 60 votes

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.670
is because generally speaking,

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.210
that is a how you stop a filibuster.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.360
If you wanna stop a filibuster,

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.690
you need to do something called cloture.

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.370
Or another way of thinking about it is

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.760
closure of the debate so
that you can get to a vote.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.190
The reason why you hear 60 votes

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.930
is for general legislation,

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.820
you need 60 votes in
order to have cloture.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.440
So even though you only need 51 votes

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.740
for the legislation to
pass once you vote on it,

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.360
to even get to that
point, you need 60 votes.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.230
This is why you hear
that for a legislation

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:36.900
to actually get through the Senate,

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.960
you need the 60 votes.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.000
There is an exception to this.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.620
That exception is around appointments.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.790
Prior to 2013,

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.510
in order to have cloture
for an appointment,

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.590
you also needed 60 votes.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.080
But in 2013, it was decided that

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.670
for non-Supreme Court
appointments, you only needed 51

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.280
votes for

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.113
cloture.

00:05:01.113 --> 00:05:04.060
Then in 2017, this was extended also

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.470
to Supreme Court appointments.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.250
Now for appointments,
you only need 51 votes

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.835
for a cloture to end a filibuster.

00:05:11.835 --> 00:05:14.880
And of course you only need
51 votes for the confirmation,

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.500
so functionally, you just
need A simple majority now

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.340
in the Senate for confirmations.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.490
But legislation, you need 60 votes.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.210
And of course for things like treaties,

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.040
you need a 2/3 super majority

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.810
to convict someone in an
impeachment, say the President,

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.580
you need 2/3 super majority.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.820
And like the House,

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.760
if we're talking about
overriding a presidential veto

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.980
or amending the constitution,
you need a 2/3 majority.

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.070
What I've just talked
about, it isn't extensive,

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.520
it isn't exhaustive of all of
the processes in the Senate.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.770
But hopefully, it gives
you appreciation of,

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.720
one, areas where the Senate
has special influence,

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.800
and also how the rules and
processes of the Senate

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.240
can be leveraged by
either majority parties

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.230
or minority parties in
order to get things done.

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:59.790
And how in the Senate,

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.620
it is harder for a simple majority

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.120
to do whatever they want.
