00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:05.120
Malaria is one of the oldest diseases in human
history, dating back to ancient civilizations

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.299
in Greece and China.

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.010
It has even been attributed to aiding the
fall of the Roman Empire.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.860
So if we’ve been fighting malaria for so
long, why haven’t we been able to stop it?

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.200
The name “malaria” comes from “mal aria”
or "bad air," because early interpretations of

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.460
the disease came before we could connect the
undesirable symptoms of malaria with a mosquito

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.590
bite. And later with a tricky little parasite
known as Plasmodium falciparum.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.320
My name is Karine Le Roch.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.100
I'm a professor at the University of California
Riverside in the department of molecular,

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.560
cell, and systems biology.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.680
And my lab is working on the human malaria parasite.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.440
So, trying to identify a new way to combat the disease.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.660
I always find that the parasite are extremely
clever.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.440
Not to mention impressive, taking down the
Roman Empire is pretty big feat for a tiny parasite.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.180
But it had a bit of help from its notorious
host, the mosquito.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.020
Though not every mosquito has the ability
to carry or spread the malaria parasite.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:08.500
There is only a very small percentage of mosquitoes that
can get infected and can transmit the disease.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.320
These mosquitoes are anopheles and only a
small proportion are anopheles and only female

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.580
because mosquitoes are usually vegetarian.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.100
And the reason they stop being vegetarian
is that females need the proteins in blood

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.830
to produce and lay eggs. So an infected mosquito
bites a human, it injects sporozoites, these

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.940
sporozoites are going to be injected to the
blood and reach the liver.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.090
The parasite wants to get into a cell fast
to avoid the patrolling immune cells.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.080
It heads to the liver first, wrapping itself
in an invisibility cloak of sorts -

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.900
the liver cell membrane.

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.110
Since our body doesn’t yet know the parasite
is there, there won’t be any resulting symptoms.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.740
The parasite replicates in the liver cells
until it bursts out, setting its sights now

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.700
on the red blood cells.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.560
These red blood cells are another good place
to take shelter from the immune system and

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.580
are perfectly suited to the parasite’s need
to replicate.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.040
As soon as the parasite is inside, it starts
to drastically alter the makeup of the cell.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:13.080
When they get inside the red blood cell, they
will take some time to maybe feel comfortable,

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:20.120
to settle down, and then they will start their
differentiation and reproduction processes.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.900
As it replicates, the parasite will snack
on hemoglobin in the red blood cells and,

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.900
by this point, the human immune system knows
that something sketchy is going on.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.140
For one thing, this red blood cell looks nothing
like it used to - it’s stiffer, stickier,

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.010
and is no longer smooth on the outside.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.579
So as soon as the parasite gets in, the host
immune system realize that the red blood cells

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:44.849
are transformed and that there is strange
things going on inside and the host immune

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:50.150
system is going to try to directly target
the infected red blood cells.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.900
When a red blood cell is infected, the immune
system will recognize it based on the parasite

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.030
proteins exported on the outside and destroy
it, but in this case the parasite has found

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.219
a way to escape this by repeatedly changing
the proteins it expresses.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.300
It becomes, essentially, a cat and mouse game
where the immune system simply can’t keep up.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.779
As soon as it knows what to destroy, the parasite
puts on a new protein mask on its host cell and

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:12.680
gets away unscathed.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.839
While its evading detection it uses human
cells to replicate and eventually differentiate

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:22.040
into male and female versions of itself, something
that can only happen in the human host.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.960
Then it needs to be picked back up by a mosquito
in order for those versions to reproduce,

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.200
which can only happen in the mosquito host.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.020
This cycle...

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:34.790
I mean you really need an infected human to
infect mosquitoes and you need an infected

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.760
mosquito to infect a human.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.519
And as if that weren’t enough, when the
red blood cells burst, they release toxins

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.860
into the blood.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.099
The major symptoms of malaria; a nasty fever,
chills, headache, vomiting, are caused in

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.660
part by these toxins.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:58.939
These can actually cause the patient to get
into coma and and stop the oxygen exchange

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.420
between your blood and your brain.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.359
So how do you treat or vaccinate against a
parasite that is constantly on the move and

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:07.110
changing what it looks like?

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.919
So that's that's a big issue.

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:16.709
A lot of money and research lab are working
on trying to define a vaccine against malaria.

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:22.729
Right now we have a vaccine that can protect
30 to 40 percent against the strongest side

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:28.650
effect of the disease but it's not protection
as we are familiar with.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:36.990
The goal of my lab is really to try to stop
the parasite in its intensive replication

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:44.900
steps or to make sure we just inhibit replication
and division of the parasite inside the human host.

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.220
And as we come up with new treatments, the
parasite itself is always evolving and evading

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.360
us in new ways.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.720
In order to eradicate the disease we really
have to become more clever than they are.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:04.420
The CDC, center for controlled disease, was
actually built to fight malaria and we've

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:09.040
been they've been they have developed an eradication
campaign that have been extremely successful

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.780
after the second World War where malaria was
eradicated from the US and Europe.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:22.360
The success was really intense because of
the use of DDT to actually kill mosquitoes.

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.840
Of course, dumping DDT on 6 million homes
isn’t really a viable solution these days

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.900
so we’re going to need to find to find a
better weapon to combat the disease.
