00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay, so if you're like me you've already glanced

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.360
at the duration of this video and are thinking this

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.930
is way too long. Don't worry. You don't have to

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.030
watch the entire thing. What we are going to do

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.190
in this video is work together to download Python. Now, downloading

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.820
a computer language can sometimes be a frustrating process. So what I'm going to

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.510
do is Go slow, and identify all of the steps in detail. By the

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.230
way, if you already have Python, feel free to skip this

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.780
video and move on to the next lesson. Also if you

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.970
prefer to read the instructions on how to download Python. There

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.660
are a few helpful documents in the Instruction Notes section. Those

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.700
documents will walk you through the exact same process that we

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.760
are following in this video. Okay, now I'm going to start

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.320
the download process on a Windows machine. If you're on a

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.730
Mac, click here to jump ahead in the video. Okay, so here

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.050
I am on a Windows machine where I will

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.390
google download Python. The first result looks good to me.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.450
You will notice that Python has two main versions.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.490
We will use Version 2.7 in this course. By the

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.100
way, the link to this page is also available

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.210
in the instructor notes. Now, this page may look slightly

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.110
different than the one you have open on your computer.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.730
That's okay, I want you to find the features that

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.170
are similar between this page and the one that you

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.200
may have open on your computer. If you scroll down on

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.480
this page, you will notice that there are a bunch

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.920
of links. Now, the first link here will help us download

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.960
Python on Windows. Notice that depending on your internet speed,

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.590
this download may take a while. One the file has downloaded

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.340
I can click to run it. This will launch a

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.820
wizard which I will go through. I will choose the default

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.050
python directory under the C drive and then I will continue to hit next a few

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.910
times. And boom, very quickly the installation will

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.560
be done. Now to test if Python installed

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.220
correctly I can go to the Start Menu,

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.700
hit All Programs, find Python 2.7, which is

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.410
what we just installed and launch Idle. Idle

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.230
is the place where we can write Python programs.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:13.020
So let's write a few programs in Idle like 2 plus 2 That seemed to work. And

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.850
print yay python. All right, congratulations. You can skip

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.680
the rest of this video and move on to

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.320
the next lesson now. Okay, so here I'm on a Mac. Now, the first thing I will do

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.860
is figure out the version of my Mac. It

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.500
seems mine is 10.7, yours may be different. Next

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.230
I will Google download Python. The first result here

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.260
seems good to me. You will notice that Python

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.970
has two main versions. We will use version 2.7

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.310
in this course. By the way The link to

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.580
this page is also available in the instructor notes.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.970
Now this page may look slightly different than the

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.370
one you have open on your computer. That's okay,

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.650
I want you to find features that are similar

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.920
between this page and the one you may have open on your computer. Now if you

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.230
scroll down on this page you will notice a bunch of links. The first few

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.460
download links are for windows. So we can safely ignore them. The next two links

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:17.390
are for mac. The first of those links is for mac 10.6 or later. Now

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.730
since my mac was 10.7 this is the right link for me. If you have

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.740
a version of Mac that came before 10.6 you

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.890
should use the other link. So, I will click

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.200
to download python. Note, that depending on your internet

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.550
speed, this download may take a while. Once Python

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.170
has downloaded, I will run the downloaded file. I

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.080
will click on this Python file while holding down

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.530
the Ctrl key and then click Open. This will

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.790
start the wizard. Here, I can hit Continue a few

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.820
times to install Python. And boom, the installation

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.270
is done. Now, to test if Python was

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.180
installed correctly, I will go Spotlight and then

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.720
type idle. Idle is the place where we

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.030
can write Python programs. Here I will hit

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.560
enter to get the python prompt and then

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.570
write a few really quick programs like 2

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.050
plus 2 that seemed to work and print yay

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:18.100
python alright congratulations you are now ready to move on to the next lesson.
