00:00:01.191 --> 00:00:02.198
- [Voiceover] Hey grammarians.

00:00:02.198 --> 00:00:04.664
So last time we talked
about RaÃºl the penguin,

00:00:04.664 --> 00:00:09.497
and how he was happier than
another penguin, Cesar.

00:00:09.497 --> 00:00:14.051
But I wanna talk today about
how to form the comparative

00:00:14.051 --> 00:00:15.482
and the superlative.

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:18.947
How to compare, how to
say something is more than

00:00:18.947 --> 00:00:23.513
or most in an unfamiliar
situation, if you're looking

00:00:23.513 --> 00:00:27.358
at a word for the first time
or you're trying to figure out

00:00:27.358 --> 00:00:31.195
how to make a word
comparative or superlative.

00:00:31.195 --> 00:00:36.195
To be like, oh well
I've got this word cute,

00:00:36.715 --> 00:00:39.752
like that's a cute little
baby penguin, but how do I say

00:00:39.752 --> 00:00:43.015
that it is more cute than another animal.

00:00:43.015 --> 00:00:44.733
Well, there's a shorthand for that.

00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:47.783
Sometimes you can say
more cute, certainly.

00:00:47.783 --> 00:00:51.182
But you can also say cuter.

00:00:51.182 --> 00:00:54.827
And you can furthermore say cutest.

00:00:54.827 --> 00:00:58.739
And it turns out that there
are a series of sound rules

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.228
in English that govern the
way that we choose to make

00:01:03.228 --> 00:01:04.972
these words go.

00:01:04.972 --> 00:01:07.994
So I'll show you each of them in turn.

00:01:07.994 --> 00:01:11.555
So we've got this little
table that I'm building here,

00:01:11.555 --> 00:01:14.922
and we've got the description,
how it looks in the

00:01:14.922 --> 00:01:18.956
comparative, and how it
looks in the superlative.

00:01:20.921 --> 00:01:23.956
So if you take a word like cute,

00:01:26.986 --> 00:01:29.989
So if you take a word like cute,

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:34.989
words like cute have one
syllable, one word sound.

00:01:37.955 --> 00:01:38.933
Cute.

00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:43.933
So a word like cute, that is
one syllable and ends in an E.

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:50.901
All we have to do to make it comparative

00:01:50.901 --> 00:01:53.734
is add an R.

00:01:53.734 --> 00:01:58.734
So, add R, and that gives us cuter.

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:06.850
For the comparative, all
you have to do is add ST,

00:02:08.434 --> 00:02:11.959
and you get the word cutest.

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.767
But what if you have a word like big?

00:02:15.767 --> 00:02:19.633
If you try to add just R to
that, it would just look like

00:02:19.633 --> 00:02:24.633
bigr, or ST to that, it would
look like bigst, and that's

00:02:27.142 --> 00:02:30.642
not really how we would
form these words in standard

00:02:30.642 --> 00:02:33.780
English, that doesn't go because they're

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.808
inconvenient to say, we like
to have vowels in between

00:02:37.808 --> 00:02:42.373
some of those consonant
sounds, between the b and the g

00:02:42.373 --> 00:02:46.590
and the st, so what you
do, if it's one syllable

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.590
and if it's got one vowel in
the middle like I, like that,

00:02:51.924 --> 00:02:56.924
one vowel, and it ends in
a consonant like a G, then

00:02:57.529 --> 00:03:02.529
what you do is double
the consonant and add ER.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.590
So this word big ends in a
G, so what I'm gonna do is

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.680
I'm gonna, for the
comparative, I'm gonna say big,

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.221
and then I'm gonna double that
G, I'm gonna use it twice.

00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:14.203
Bigger.

00:03:14.203 --> 00:03:17.225
Like that, and then add the ER.

00:03:17.225 --> 00:03:20.409
Likewise for the superlative, same thing.

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:25.253
So you double the consonant
at the end of the word,

00:03:25.253 --> 00:03:30.253
and then you add EST, so
it becomes BIG and then

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.390
I double this consonant
sound, so BIGGEST, biggest.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.840
And for words like short and sweet,

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.556
oh I should clarify.

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:47.759
For this one, for big, this
should end in one consonant.

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:51.983
So BIG, there's only one
consonant there, because

00:03:51.983 --> 00:03:54.924
for words like short and
sweet that have one syllable,

00:03:54.924 --> 00:03:59.924
but either have two vowels like
sweet does, so it's E and E

00:04:02.316 --> 00:04:07.316
or two consonants at the end,
what you do is you just add ER

00:04:10.982 --> 00:04:15.866
so shorter or sweeter.

00:04:17.482 --> 00:04:22.315
And for the superlative form, add EST.

00:04:23.558 --> 00:04:26.236
So shortest or sweetest.

00:04:27.698 --> 00:04:29.480
And now we're getting
into the weird stuff.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.388
So if you take a word like
shiny, which is two syllables,

00:04:33.388 --> 00:04:38.316
and it ends in Y, then what you have to do

00:04:38.316 --> 00:04:43.316
is you change Y into an I, and you add ER.

00:04:44.915 --> 00:04:48.875
So shiny becomes shinier.

00:04:48.875 --> 00:04:51.689
See how this Y becomes and I here?

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:54.523
Same thing for superlative,
the Y becomes an I,

00:04:54.523 --> 00:04:59.073
and then you add EST, so shiniest.

00:05:03.207 --> 00:05:08.074
Now, if you've got a
word like magnificent,

00:05:11.957 --> 00:05:16.023
magnificent, this is a four syllable word,

00:05:16.023 --> 00:05:19.174
it means like super huge,
super great, super wonderful,

00:05:19.174 --> 00:05:22.473
you've got a word like that,
you take a word like that,

00:05:22.473 --> 00:05:26.346
it's a little bit too big
to be adding more parts to

00:05:26.346 --> 00:05:28.647
the way that standard
American English works.

00:05:28.647 --> 00:05:32.387
So you wouldn't say
magnificenter, or magnificentest.

00:05:32.387 --> 00:05:35.145
It just sounds unwieldy,
'cause the word's already

00:05:35.145 --> 00:05:39.688
pretty long, so if you've got
a two or more syllable word,

00:05:39.688 --> 00:05:44.688
that doesn't end in Y, then
you just have to add the word

00:05:46.622 --> 00:05:51.605
more to the beginning,
so more magnificent, and

00:05:51.605 --> 00:05:54.639
most magnificent.

00:05:55.606 --> 00:05:57.888
So let's say that you're
encountering a word you've

00:05:57.888 --> 00:06:00.172
never seen before.

00:06:00.172 --> 00:06:05.172
And in a sentence you have to
compare, let's say the word

00:06:05.172 --> 00:06:07.788
is blarfy, I don't know what it means,

00:06:07.788 --> 00:06:09.639
probably something gross.

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:13.873
So if we wanna compare
two really gross meals,

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:18.873
like a steaming pile of
dog food covered in flies,

00:06:25.056 --> 00:06:29.961
or a plate of ancient
cheese that 3000 years old.

00:06:31.128 --> 00:06:33.226
You gotta eat it, gross.

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:35.680
Which one is grosser?

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.211
But you have to describe
them using the word blarfy,

00:06:39.211 --> 00:06:40.681
this word we've never seen before.

00:06:40.681 --> 00:06:43.861
Well, what do we know about blarfy?

00:06:43.861 --> 00:06:47.846
Well, it's got two syllables, blarfy,

00:06:47.846 --> 00:06:51.513
so that automatically crosses
out any of this stuff,

00:06:52.703 --> 00:06:56.087
it does end in a Y, blarfy,
so we know that it's

00:06:56.087 --> 00:07:00.790
probably going to behave like
shiny, like the word shiny,

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:05.192
because it's got two
syllables and it ends in Y.

00:07:05.192 --> 00:07:10.192
So, I'm gonna say that the
dog food is less blarfy,

00:07:13.239 --> 00:07:18.239
and the cheese is blarfier,
in fact this cheese

00:07:21.456 --> 00:07:24.924
is the blarfiest food on the planet.

00:07:24.924 --> 00:07:27.555
Now don't get me wrong, I
love a good stinky cheese,

00:07:27.555 --> 00:07:31.505
but this one in particular,
this 3000 year old cheese,

00:07:31.505 --> 00:07:35.121
super blarfy, in fact, I'm
just gonna go so far as to say

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:37.077
it is the blarfiest.

00:07:37.077 --> 00:07:38.223
You can blarf anything.

00:07:38.223 --> 00:07:39.842
David out.
