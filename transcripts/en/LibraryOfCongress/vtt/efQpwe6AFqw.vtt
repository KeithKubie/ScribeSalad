[Applause]
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:03:01.492 --> 00:03:03.492
And everyone, welcome here to 
the Library of Congress.

00:03:04.763 --> 00:03:07.893
I'm delighted to welcome you on 
behalf of Dr. Hayden, the 

00:03:07.894 --> 00:03:09.894
Librarian of Congress to this 
year's Americas Award Ceremony.

For 25 years the consortium of 
Consortium of Latin America 

00:03:17.325 --> 00:03:19.325
Studies 

00:03:20.372 --> 00:03:22.870
Programs, Tulane's university 
Center for Latin America Studies

00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:24.871
and Vanderbilt 

00:03:26.858 --> 00:03:28.023
University for Latin American 
studies have collaborated with 

00:03:28.024 --> 00:03:33.263
the Library of Congress to 
celebrate children's books that 

00:03:33.264 --> 00:03:35.301
portray Latin America, the 
Caribbean and Latinos in the 

00:03:35.302 --> 00:03:39.803
United States.  I'm aware there 
are many here that have been 

00:03:39.804 --> 00:03:41.804
involved in coordinating this 

00:03:43.244 --> 00:03:45.244
event and I want to welcome 
Denise 

00:03:46.307 --> 00:03:48.307
Walter Vargas and her colleagues
here to the library.

00:03:50.203 --> 00:03:52.203
But I would also like to take 
this 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.119
opportunity to extend a very 
special thanks to Georgeette 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.120
Dorne.

00:04:01.423 --> 00:04:03.465
Having worked at the Library of 
Congress for 55 years and having

00:04:03.466 --> 00:04:06.112
served as the chief of the 
Hispanic Division with 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.950
great distinction

00:04:13.712 --> 00:04:15.954
since 1994, Georgette is 
retiring next month.  She began 

00:04:15.955 --> 00:04:17.955
her career at the Library of 

00:04:19.186 --> 00:04:21.186
Congress in 1962 moving to the 
Hispanic Division in 1969.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.336
In her role as chief she 
initiated the digitization of 

00:04:27.337 --> 00:04:29.337
the handbook of Latin America 
studies and creation of the 

00:04:32.036 --> 00:04:33.267
online website and the 
digitization of the archive 

00:04:33.268 --> 00:04:35.268
Hispanic literature on tape.

00:04:39.144 --> 00:04:41.144
As well as making the 
collections freely 

00:04:42.226 --> 00:04:44.502
available online, Georgette 
influenced those using or 

00:04:44.503 --> 00:04:46.727
interested in using these 
resources.

00:04:48.972 --> 00:04:50.972
Additionally, through her 
administration 

00:04:54.895 --> 00:04:56.530
of the huntington Society Gift 
Fund, Georgette awarded 

00:04:56.531 --> 00:04:58.531
internships to 

00:04:59.601 --> 00:05:01.258
hundreds of graduate and 
undergraduate students to work 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:04.124
in the Hispanic Division.  Many 
interns are members of the 

00:05:06.992 --> 00:05:07.587
current generation of Latin 
America bibographers in the 

00:05:07.588 --> 00:05:09.836
United States.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.715
Georgette's vision and passion 
for literature, scholarship and 

00:05:14.716 --> 00:05:16.716
programming 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.220
have left an indelible mark on 
our institution and have 

00:05:21.221 --> 00:05:23.221
strengthened the 

00:05:24.695 --> 00:05:26.756
myriad of roles that the 
Hispanic culture plays in the 

00:05:26.757 --> 00:05:28.757
library collection, outreach 
efforts and programming.

00:05:30.832 --> 00:05:33.069
Indeed the tradition of hosting 
this particular event here at 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.070
the library 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.746
materialized in many ways thanks
to Georgette's belief in the 

00:05:37.747 --> 00:05:41.429
value of the Americas Award.
We wish her a wonderful 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.675
retirement and we thank her for 
her countless contributions 

00:05:44.676 --> 00:05:46.711
throughout her career.

00:05:49.927 --> 00:05:51.927
[Applause]

00:05:58.311 --> 00:05:59.522
SPEAKER: I would like to close 
by congratulating all of those 

00:05:59.523 --> 00:06:03.396
involved in the Americas Award, 
the organizers, winners, past 

00:06:03.397 --> 00:06:05.397
and present, and congratulate 
you on your 25th anniversary.

00:06:10.547 --> 00:06:12.186
All of you are here and those 
watching online, enjoy this 

00:06:12.187 --> 00:06:14.187
afternoon's program, 

00:06:17.076 --> 00:06:19.076
and I will pass it to the 
esteemed Georgette.

00:06:21.292 --> 00:06:23.292
[Applause]

00:06:28.675 --> 00:06:30.307
SPEAKER: I'm very glad that my 
last official function is 

00:06:30.308 --> 00:06:32.308
hosting the Americas Award.

00:06:35.584 --> 00:06:37.584
It began 25 years ago with the 

00:06:38.694 --> 00:06:40.311
University of Wisconsin at 
Madison -- I'm sorry, in 

00:06:40.312 --> 00:06:42.963
Milwaukee.  And now Tulane and 
Vanderbilt.

00:06:46.056 --> 00:06:47.485
So welcome, this year's 
awardees.  I'm pleased to 

00:06:47.486 --> 00:06:49.486
welcome everybody here.  Thank 
you.

00:07:04.232 --> 00:07:06.232
SPEAKER: Good afternoon.

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:09.279
I would like to say thank you to

Catalina Gomez, Mark Sweeny, 
Georgette, 

00:07:15.657 --> 00:07:15.865

00:07:15.866 --> 00:07:17.866

Tulane University, we welcome 
you to the 25th ceremony of 

00:07:25.092 --> 00:07:27.092

be here.

00:07:30.413 --> 00:07:33.072
Sharing the ceremony with you 
across the country, streaming 

00:07:33.073 --> 00:07:35.073
with fans across 

00:07:39.187 --> 00:07:41.246
the country with our members, 
it's great addition this year to

00:07:41.247 --> 00:07:43.477
be streaming and engaging with 
the awards with communities 

00:07:43.478 --> 00:07:45.478
across the country.

00:07:46.763 --> 00:07:48.586
Cosponsors of this year's award 
are working with teachers to 

00:07:48.587 --> 00:07:52.657
develop curriculum that 
correspond with books forming 

00:07:52.658 --> 00:07:54.658
book clubs, creating book 
trailers and much more.

00:07:57.342 --> 00:07:58.739
The awards are administered by 
the Consortium of Latin American

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:02.922
Studies Programs and coordinated
by Tulane and Vanderbilt.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.375
Generous support is also 
provided by Florida 

00:08:08.376 --> 00:08:11.020
International University, 
Stanford University, the Ohio 

00:08:11.021 --> 00:08:13.021
State 

00:08:14.195 --> 00:08:16.428

support from senators across the

00:08:26.807 --> 00:08:28.807
country.

00:08:29.859 --> 00:08:31.859
Awards are given up to two weeks
each 

00:08:34.176 --> 00:08:35.616
year and selected for 
distinctive literary quality, 

00:08:35.617 --> 00:08:38.868
exceptional integration of text,
illustration and design and 

00:08:38.869 --> 00:08:40.869
potential for classroom use.

00:08:42.715 --> 00:08:45.566
The goal of this award is to 
link the Americas to reach 

00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:47.567
beyond geographic 

00:08:49.434 --> 00:08:49.842
borders focusing instead on 
cultural heritages within the 

00:08:49.843 --> 00:08:52.695
hemisphere.
I would like to take a moment to

00:08:52.696 --> 00:08:55.753
say thank you to our committee. 
Many of our committee members 

00:08:55.754 --> 00:08:57.754
are here with us today.

00:09:00.629 --> 00:09:02.848
This year's Americas Award 
review committee was comprised 

00:09:02.849 --> 00:09:07.538
of teachers, librarians, faculty
and community activists from 

00:09:07.539 --> 00:09:09.368
Tennessee, Texas, Illinois, 
North Carolina, and Wisconsin.

00:09:12.427 --> 00:09:14.427
This year Paula Mason was our 
chair of the committee.

00:09:17.793 --> 00:09:18.615
She's a librarian for the 
Waukesha Public Library in 

00:09:18.616 --> 00:09:20.616
Wisconsin.

00:09:22.318 --> 00:09:24.139
Just to give an idea of the 
process the committee goes 

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:27.403
through, in the fall books 
arrive, throughout the year.  By

00:09:27.404 --> 00:09:29.404
January we have our list.

00:09:32.296 --> 00:09:34.296
We set up Skype calls in the 
spring 

00:09:35.336 --> 00:09:37.336
and chat for hours over weekends
about 

00:09:39.373 --> 00:09:42.109
amazing books, and they are 
spirited conversations about the

00:09:43.122 --> 00:09:45.371
cultures of Latin America and 
the Caribbean.  Colleen and I 

00:09:45.372 --> 00:09:47.372
are grateful for the hard work 
of the committee and care they 

00:09:49.862 --> 00:09:51.475
put into this year's award 
winners, Honorable Mention and 

00:09:51.476 --> 00:09:53.476
Commended Titles.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:59.225
I would like to share some 
messages about our founder of 

00:09:59.226 --> 00:10:01.226
the Americas Award, Julie.

00:10:02.488 --> 00:10:05.131
The Americas Award began as an 
idea 25 years ago by my 

00:10:05.132 --> 00:10:07.132
colleague, Julie.

00:10:09.039 --> 00:10:11.268
She is the associate director 
for center of Latin America 

00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:13.269
studies at University Wisconsin 
Milwaukee.

00:10:15.579 --> 00:10:17.822
She started the award with no 
other award recognizing Latin 

00:10:17.823 --> 00:10:20.920
America and Latino culture in 
children's and young adults 

00:10:20.921 --> 00:10:22.921
literature yet existed.

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:27.640
Her idea became one of the most 
important projects of CLASP.  It

00:10:27.641 --> 00:10:29.681
has enabled scholars of Latin 
America to come together and 

00:10:29.682 --> 00:10:31.520
engage with children's 
literature in many diverse ways.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.458
It has become our passion and 
our responsibility to educators 

00:10:37.459 --> 00:10:40.701
to read and share authentic and 
engaging literature for the K12 

00:10:40.702 --> 00:10:43.157
classroom.  I want to thank 
Julie by presenting to 

00:10:46.824 --> 00:10:48.824
her a symbol she once created 
years ago, 

00:10:50.692 --> 00:10:52.512
a weaving from Guatemala that 
represents the weaving of 

00:10:52.513 --> 00:10:54.513
stories and voices of the 
Americas.

00:10:55.788 --> 00:10:56.800
I would like to invite my 
daughter to share our token of 

00:10:56.801 --> 00:10:58.801
thanks.

00:11:10.838 --> 00:11:12.838
[Applause]

00:11:20.187 --> 00:11:22.834
SPEAKER: I want to thank you for
say muchos gracias.  Julia, come

00:11:22.835 --> 00:11:25.488
on up.

00:11:28.901 --> 00:11:30.901
[Applause]

00:11:32.256 --> 00:11:34.256
SPEAKER: Good afternoon.

00:11:35.567 --> 00:11:37.567
Wow! 25 years.

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:45.700
In his 1990 acceptance speech at
the 

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.960
Library of Congress for the 
Americas 

00:11:50.641 --> 00:11:52.641
Award, author Francisco herm 
said for 

00:11:54.527 --> 00:11:56.145
most of my school days I didn't 
find the literature the 

00:11:56.146 --> 00:11:58.146
experiences I had gone through, 
so I decide it was very 

00:12:02.095 --> 00:12:03.308
important to promote in any way 
possible ethnic American 

00:12:03.309 --> 00:12:05.372
literature and also to 
contribute to that body of 

00:12:05.373 --> 00:12:10.278
literature.  And I thought it 
was important to do that because

00:12:10.279 --> 00:12:13.142
the curriculum, what we study in
school, reflects who we are as a

00:12:13.143 --> 00:12:15.143
people.

00:12:18.453 --> 00:12:21.115
So if we did not see ourselves 
as students, if we do not see 

00:12:21.116 --> 00:12:24.193
ourselves reflected in the 
curriculum, in the literature, 

00:12:24.194 --> 00:12:26.194
in the music, in the art 

00:12:27.641 --> 00:12:29.682
that we study, then we do not 
arrive at good understanding of 

00:12:29.683 --> 00:12:33.578
who we are personally and who we
are as a nation.

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:38.457
From the start, our goals for 
the Americas Award were simple, 

00:12:38.458 --> 00:12:42.917
to highlight books that allow 
children and young adults to see

00:12:42.918 --> 00:12:44.918
themselves in the literature, to
encourage U.S.

00:12:48.476 --> 00:12:50.476
publication of such books, to 
showcase 

00:12:51.523 --> 00:12:53.523
the diversity of Latin America, 
the 

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:56.790
Caribbean and other of America's
communities in the hemisphere.

00:12:59.068 --> 00:13:01.108
And to encourage young people to
read engaging stories about life

00:13:01.109 --> 00:13:03.109
in cultures perhaps different to
them.

00:13:07.217 --> 00:13:09.217
The Americas Award was inspired 
by the 

00:13:11.516 --> 00:13:13.544
children's Africana book award 
created with the outreach 

00:13:13.545 --> 00:13:15.545
council of the African studies 
association.

00:13:16.844 --> 00:13:18.860
The book award concept seemed a 
perfect project to propose to 

00:13:18.861 --> 00:13:20.861
the class 

00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:24.147
teaching and outreach committee.
I had some background that made 

00:13:24.148 --> 00:13:26.148
me 

00:13:27.425 --> 00:13:28.833
really interested in 
internationalism in children's 

00:13:28.834 --> 00:13:30.834
book and the committee at the 

00:13:32.343 --> 00:13:34.343
time was extremely receptive to 
the 

00:13:36.414 --> 00:13:38.414
idea, and we did an event 
through my 

00:13:39.653 --> 00:13:41.925
center, 1991 called "Reading 
Latin America."  Both Columbia 

00:13:41.926 --> 00:13:43.339
teachers college and in 
Milwaukee, which I sort of count

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:47.405
that as a starting point, 
because it gave us a sense of 

00:13:47.406 --> 00:13:49.406
what was out there at the time 

00:13:50.477 --> 00:13:52.901
in terms of this kind of content
in children's books.

00:13:55.759 --> 00:13:57.630
The class committee helped shape
the award criterion and in doing

00:13:57.631 --> 00:14:02.301
so we decided to focus on the 
multicultural international 

00:14:02.302 --> 00:14:06.401
dynamic, including the Latin X 
experience in the U.S. and 

00:14:06.402 --> 00:14:08.229
including all the Americas, not 
just Spanish-speaking countries 

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:11.072
and communities.
We also determine the award 

00:14:11.073 --> 00:14:13.073
should be more than recognition 
of winners but 

00:14:16.969 --> 00:14:19.404
rather should include an notated
annual bibliography of dmended 

00:14:19.405 --> 00:14:21.405
titles to be a 

00:14:23.237 --> 00:14:25.237
glide for classroom classroom 
use and library development.

00:14:28.997 --> 00:14:30.829
As we define the award with 
rationale and criteria and what 

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:32.859
to include and where to draw 
lines, I remember the 

00:14:36.544 --> 00:14:37.968
comment by Linda Miller, a 
outreach coordinator at the 

00:14:37.969 --> 00:14:39.969
University of Florida.

00:14:41.268 --> 00:14:43.318
She said, "when the world is 
made up of lumber and splinters,

00:14:43.319 --> 00:14:47.420
that is, people who think about 
commonalities and connections 

00:14:47.421 --> 00:14:49.421
and those who think about 

00:14:51.298 --> 00:14:53.736
difference and separation.  
Shaping the early Americas 

00:14:53.737 --> 00:14:55.737
Award, we 

00:14:57.811 --> 00:14:59.811
aim to be lumpers through and 
through."

00:15:00.854 --> 00:15:02.854
The award was further refined 
through 

00:15:04.142 --> 00:15:05.356
the expertise, thoughtfulness of
the national review committee 

00:15:05.357 --> 00:15:07.399
members.  All of you and your 
predecessors.

00:15:10.866 --> 00:15:12.866
And as it has matured other 
children's 

00:15:14.151 --> 00:15:16.151
book awards were established.

00:15:17.192 --> 00:15:19.834
Each award makes a contribution 
and we've dovetailed with each, 

00:15:19.835 --> 00:15:21.865
I think, in a way that benefits 
the field of children's 

00:15:21.866 --> 00:15:23.866
literature.

00:15:26.337 --> 00:15:28.374
In the case of the Americas, 
both the awards recognition of 

00:15:28.375 --> 00:15:33.856
the diversity Americas and 
inclusion of a criterion focused

00:15:33.857 --> 00:15:36.308
specifically on potential 
classroom use helps make its 

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.500
contributions unique.

00:15:46.501 --> 00:15:50.365
So, I remember after the first 
competition... Ron, I think we 

00:15:50.366 --> 00:15:52.366
had a whole six books 

00:15:53.635 --> 00:15:55.635
on the commended list, and wrote
a letter to the committee.

00:15:58.127 --> 00:16:00.590
I believe there was onion-skin 
paper involved -- it was back 

00:16:00.591 --> 00:16:05.084
then -- and it said something 
about "we'll look back 20 years 

00:16:05.085 --> 00:16:07.085
from now and look at what we 
started.

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:10.170
"  Well, it's been 25 years and 
there's 

00:16:12.053 --> 00:16:14.053
been over 400 titles recognized 
since 

00:16:15.733 --> 00:16:17.733
1993 as winner, honor and 
commended 

00:16:19.622 --> 00:16:21.882
books, and the ongoing 
relationship with the Library of

00:16:21.883 --> 00:16:23.883
Congress has given us a 

00:16:25.605 --> 00:16:27.605
way to truly celebrate the 
books' authors and illustrators.

00:16:30.512 --> 00:16:32.541
Creatively coordinated since 
2011 by Vanderbilt and Tulane, 

00:16:32.542 --> 00:16:34.791
the Americas Award is stronger 
and more vibrant than ever.

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:39.850
And it's enhanced by the 
innovative 

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:42.374
outreach programming by 
colleagues at Latin America 

00:16:42.375 --> 00:16:44.375
studies centers across the U.S.

00:16:45.647 --> 00:16:47.647
Diversity in children's 
literature has 

00:16:50.715 --> 00:16:52.715
a long way to go, but we cannot 

00:16:55.636 --> 00:16:57.269
appreciate the award, 25-year 
and counting contribution to 

00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:59.270
diversity in 

00:17:00.345 --> 00:17:03.034
recognition of books of 
distinctive literary quality, 

00:17:03.035 --> 00:17:07.120
contextualization, noteworthy of
text, illustration and design, 

00:17:07.121 --> 00:17:09.121
and potential for classroom use.
Thank you.

00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:14.590
[Applause]

00:17:18.205 --> 00:17:20.205

00:17:21.667 --> 00:17:23.667
briefly to -- back to Georgette 
Dorn.

00:17:26.752 --> 00:17:28.752
The relationship of the Library 
of 

00:17:31.224 --> 00:17:33.867
Congress has been really 
valuable for the Americas Award 

00:17:33.868 --> 00:17:36.539
and it was you and I and a 
meeting in New Orleans, getting 

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:39.260
in a car after a committee 
meeting, going 

00:17:44.683 --> 00:17:47.133
to lunch, and Georgette said, 
"We should have this at the 

00:17:47.134 --> 00:17:49.134
Library of Congress..

00:17:50.972 --> 00:17:52.972
"  I said, "uh-huh, that would 
be swell.

00:17:54.429 --> 00:17:55.680
"  It was because of Georgette 
and the division over the years 

00:17:55.681 --> 00:18:00.167
that we have been able to give 
this kind of weight, this kind 

00:18:00.168 --> 00:18:02.168
of value to the Americas Award.

00:18:03.848 --> 00:18:06.680
And it's very much Georgette and
the Hispanic Division.  Thank 

00:18:06.681 --> 00:18:08.681
you, Georgette, very much.

00:18:15.928 --> 00:18:17.928

If anybody has helped with the 
weaving 

00:18:25.091 --> 00:18:27.091

Thank you, Georgette.

00:26:17.152 --> 00:26:19.152
It is my great pleasure to 
present the 

00:26:20.185 --> 00:26:22.185
2W-78 Americas Award to Duncan 
Tonatiuh 

00:26:24.874 --> 00:26:26.874
for his children's book "Danza!

00:26:27.922 --> 00:26:31.382
," Amailia Hernandez for "El 
Ballet Folklorico de Mexico."  

00:26:31.383 --> 00:26:36.285
You may no Mr. Tonatiuh is an 
author and illustrators whose 

00:26:36.286 --> 00:26:38.286
work has been recognized several
times.

00:26:39.731 --> 00:26:41.997
In addition to the award we 
present today, Mr. Tonatiuh was 

00:26:41.998 --> 00:26:43.998
a 2015 Americas Award 

00:26:45.036 --> 00:26:47.036
winner for his book Separate is 
Never 

00:26:48.477 --> 00:26:49.903
Equal and won Honorable Mention 
in 2014 and 2016 in addition to 

00:26:49.904 --> 00:26:52.401
having multiple books on our 
Commended Titles list.

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:56.230
I would like to thank Mr.

00:26:59.041 --> 00:27:02.574
Tonatiuh for his many 
contributions to Latin America 

00:26:59.041 --> 00:27:02.706
children's literature.
"Danza!" documents an important 

00:27:02.707 --> 00:27:04.707
part of Latin America and 
performing arts history.

00:27:10.662 --> 00:27:12.691
It is story of a life work to 
create a dance company that 

00:27:12.692 --> 00:27:14.692
brought to life the 

00:27:15.758 --> 00:27:18.397
history and indigenous 
identities and cultures of 

00:27:18.398 --> 00:27:20.398
Mexico through contemporary 
movement.

00:27:22.266 --> 00:27:24.266
Hernandez's dance and 
choreography in 

00:27:25.522 --> 00:27:28.162
many ways was about recognizing 
and honoring Mexico's history 

00:27:28.163 --> 00:27:32.626
and in turn Mr. Tonatiuh does 
the same in telling the story of

00:27:32.627 --> 00:27:35.266
Hernandez's lifelong devotion to
her craft and the impact it made

00:27:35.267 --> 00:27:37.267
on Mexico and the world.

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:43.805
In his typical Mixtec inspired 
style with creative textures and

00:27:43.806 --> 00:27:45.806
rich colors, Mr. Tonatiuh draws 
readers into the pages.

00:27:48.565 --> 00:27:50.565
This book is the first of its 
kind to 

00:27:52.634 --> 00:27:55.529
tell the story of Amailia 
Hernandez to a children's 

00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:56.946
audience and makes more 
accessible Latin America pioneer

00:27:56.947 --> 00:27:58.947
in the arts.

00:28:02.642 --> 00:28:04.715
I imagine young Latina dancers 
and any young dancer reading 

00:28:04.716 --> 00:28:06.716
this story with pleasure 
empowered with the knowledge of 

00:28:07.783 --> 00:28:09.783
who came before them, who paved 
the way.

00:28:11.663 --> 00:28:13.663
I would like to now present 
Duncan 

00:28:15.131 --> 00:28:16.541
Tonatiuh with the 2018 Americas 
Award for children's and young 

00:28:16.542 --> 00:28:19.383
adult literature.
[Applause]

00:28:42.163 --> 00:28:46.639
DUNCAN TONATIUH: Thank you.  I'm
happy and grateful to be here.  

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.082
I want to congratulate my fellow
authors and illustrators whose 

00:28:49.083 --> 00:28:51.083
work is being celebrated, 
recognized today.

00:28:54.173 --> 00:28:56.213
I'm very thankful to CLASP, to 
the committee for celebrating my

00:28:56.214 --> 00:28:58.214
work, for 

00:29:00.357 --> 00:29:01.363
choosing my work, and all the 
wonderful books that you're 

00:29:01.364 --> 00:29:03.364
presenting today.

00:29:06.281 --> 00:29:08.281
I think the Americas Award does 
a 

00:29:09.354 --> 00:29:11.826
wonderful job in doing that and 
highlighting and creating this 

00:29:11.827 --> 00:29:13.827
list of 

00:29:14.907 --> 00:29:15.723
books, this body of work that 
celebrates Latin America and 

00:29:15.724 --> 00:29:18.165
Latinos in the U.S.

00:29:22.225 --> 00:29:24.478
I also really appreciate and 
feel very grateful to CLASP for 

00:29:24.479 --> 00:29:26.528
their continuous support that 
they have recognized some 

00:29:29.972 --> 00:29:32.634
of my work in the past, and in 
the job they do creating 

00:29:32.635 --> 00:29:35.672
resources to use the books in 
the classroom.  I think that's 

00:29:35.673 --> 00:29:38.324
something very special and 
wonderful that the Americas 

00:29:38.325 --> 00:29:40.325
Award does, creating different 
guides and 

00:29:42.825 --> 00:29:45.509
different ways, not only 
recognizing books but making 

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:49.168
them useful to teachers and to 
people in the classroom.

00:29:51.761 --> 00:29:53.786
I take the opportunity to thank 
people at Abrams who made this 

00:29:53.787 --> 00:29:55.787
book possible, 

00:29:57.855 --> 00:29:59.855
and I feel very grateful to the 
people 

00:30:00.938 --> 00:30:03.765
there, and the whole team it 
took to create a book and I've 

00:30:03.766 --> 00:30:08.761
been making books with Abrams 
now almost ten years and it's 

00:30:08.762 --> 00:30:10.811
been a wonderful relationship 
and I'm happy that they have 

00:30:10.812 --> 00:30:12.812
supported my 

00:30:14.679 --> 00:30:17.088
work and helped it be 
successful, and I especially 

00:30:17.089 --> 00:30:19.969
want to thank my editor, Howard 
Reeves, who has always been very

00:30:23.628 --> 00:30:26.066
thoughtful and has made my work 
Bert by his thoughtful and 

00:30:26.067 --> 00:30:28.807
careful editing, but also for 
being a friend and just kind of 

00:30:31.662 --> 00:30:33.094
looking after me and supporting 
my vision and the books that I 

00:30:33.095 --> 00:30:35.095
want to create.

00:30:38.417 --> 00:30:40.417
I want to thank my family, my 
wife, for 

00:30:41.684 --> 00:30:43.684
her love and for her 
partnership, for 

00:30:44.732 --> 00:30:46.732
being a partner in this 
adventure, to my 

00:30:48.406 --> 00:30:50.645
kids, who are just my -- I have 
a three-year-old daughter and a 

00:30:53.507 --> 00:30:56.406
one-year-old son who are just 
bringing a lot of joy and 

00:30:56.407 --> 00:30:58.407
happiness, and I thank them for 
that.

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:04.141
And I just want to tell really 
briefly how this book came 

00:31:04.142 --> 00:31:08.012
about, give you sort of the 
story behind the book.

00:31:10.848 --> 00:31:12.848
My wife, Patty, she's a dancer.

00:31:15.179 --> 00:31:17.652
She's classically trained and 
she does modern and contemporary

00:31:17.653 --> 00:31:22.768
dance and last year she EEG been
doing aerial dance with the hoop

00:31:22.769 --> 00:31:24.769
and straps and the trapeze.

00:31:26.666 --> 00:31:29.102
And I found a few illustrations 
about her dancing, and I like 

00:31:29.103 --> 00:31:31.103
dancing myself and I like 
watching dance, so I made 

00:31:37.248 --> 00:31:38.051
some images about that, and I so
it's something that I'm 

00:31:38.052 --> 00:31:40.052
interested in.

00:31:41.773 --> 00:31:44.310
But my wife's mother was a 
dancer and her grandmother was a

00:31:44.311 --> 00:31:46.311
dancer too, and my 

00:31:48.334 --> 00:31:50.868
wife's mother, my mother-in-law,
she danced with the Ballet 

00:31:50.869 --> 00:31:55.594
Folklorico de Mexico in the '70s
for a few years.  And it came up

00:31:55.595 --> 00:31:57.595
in conversation at some point, 
and that gave me the idea of 

00:31:59.654 --> 00:32:01.654
making a book about Amailia 
Hernandez.

00:32:04.148 --> 00:32:06.581
So that is sort of on one hand. 
On the other hand, another 

00:32:06.582 --> 00:32:08.582
reason for 

00:32:09.852 --> 00:32:11.501
doing the book, like I remember 
-- I grew up in Mexico and I 

00:32:11.502 --> 00:32:13.763
remember when I was seven or 
eight years old, dressing 

00:32:20.525 --> 00:32:22.988
up like a charro and dancing, 
and it's a common experience for

00:32:22.989 --> 00:32:25.839
a kid, especially, I think to 
celebrate a special occasion, 

00:32:28.275 --> 00:32:30.275
like Mother's Day or the end of 
the 

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:33.540
school year to perform a 
folklore dance.

00:32:35.464 --> 00:32:37.464
And later on when I was a 
teenager, I 

00:32:41.299 --> 00:32:43.299
came to the United

00:32:44.845 --> 00:32:46.877
States, also popular and 
importance for occasions when 

00:32:46.878 --> 00:32:48.931
different kinds of people 
celebrate their culture or 

00:32:48.932 --> 00:32:51.591
celebrate their heritage, and in
the case of 

00:32:56.665 --> 00:32:58.087
Mexican American people, days 
like Cinco de Mayo, it's a way 

00:32:58.088 --> 00:33:00.088
to show that you're 

00:33:04.868 --> 00:33:06.868
proud of your roots, do display 
your 

00:33:09.383 --> 00:33:11.383
culture, and so I wanted to do a
book 

00:33:12.841 --> 00:33:14.841
about dance and especially for 
that 

00:33:15.987 --> 00:33:17.004
dance because I know it's not 
only an important experience in 

00:33:17.005 --> 00:33:19.005
the country 

00:33:20.418 --> 00:33:21.426
where it comes from, in this 
case, Mexico, but also in the 

00:33:21.427 --> 00:33:24.065
U.S.  And when I heard my 
mother-in-law 

00:33:28.484 --> 00:33:30.484
talking about

00:33:32.416 --> 00:33:35.274
Folklorico Ballet, it made sense
to do it about Amailia 

00:33:35.275 --> 00:33:37.275
Hernandez, a woman who dedicated
her life to learning about the 

00:33:39.245 --> 00:33:40.678
traditional dances in Mexico and
being able to adapt them to the 

00:33:40.679 --> 00:33:42.679
theater and 

00:33:43.813 --> 00:33:45.813
being able to share them on the 
world stage.

00:33:48.393 --> 00:33:50.219
So, again, I just want to say 
thank you.  I'm very grateful.  

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:52.220
I'm very happy.

00:33:55.093 --> 00:33:57.740
I feel very fortunate for all 
the support and for all that the

00:33:57.741 --> 00:33:59.785
Americas Award does.
So thank you very much.

00:34:02.797 --> 00:34:04.797
[Applause]

00:34:22.271 --> 00:34:24.271
SPEAKER: Good afternoon.

00:34:25.325 --> 00:34:27.994
My name is Paula Mason and I'm a
reference librarian at the 

00:34:27.995 --> 00:34:31.038
Waukesha public library in 
Wisconsin.  It's a great honor 

00:34:31.039 --> 00:34:33.039
to be here with you today.

00:34:34.696 --> 00:34:36.696
I have the privilege of 
introducing a 

00:34:38.996 --> 00:34:41.037
truly phenomenal author, Ibi 
Zoboi whose title "American 

00:34:41.038 --> 00:34:43.038
Street" moved our hearts and 
spirit immensely this year.

00:34:48.787 --> 00:34:51.047
Through ib's confidence and 
powerful prose, we have the 

00:34:51.048 --> 00:34:53.688
chance to meet Fabiola, a 
teenager painfully separated 

00:34:56.775 --> 00:34:58.784
from her mother as they seek a 
beautiful future in the United 

00:34:58.785 --> 00:35:00.785
States with her aunts and 
cousins in Detroit.

00:35:03.664 --> 00:35:05.664
The story is so many things at 
once, 

00:35:07.355 --> 00:35:09.393
but to name a few, it's a tale 
of great bravery, resilience of 

00:35:09.394 --> 00:35:13.891
spirit and faith, and of culture
and family which help carry us 

00:35:13.892 --> 00:35:15.892
through times of unimaginable 

00:35:16.952 --> 00:35:20.420
loss and rebuilding our future 
when everything falls apart.  It

00:35:20.421 --> 00:35:22.421
also pierces through our hearts 
and 

00:35:24.089 --> 00:35:25.721
minds with the timeliest of 
themes, such as immigration, 

00:35:25.722 --> 00:35:27.957
family separation, and the 
senseless tragedy of young lives

00:35:27.958 --> 00:35:29.958
lost.

00:35:32.484 --> 00:35:34.484
However, at the cross roads of 
"American 

00:35:36.372 --> 00:35:39.400
Street," Ibi never leads the 
reader behind without hope.  She

00:35:39.401 --> 00:35:42.099
brings us alongside Fabiola and 
her ever-evolving journey toward

00:35:42.695 --> 00:35:44.695
achieving her own dreams.

00:35:46.287 --> 00:35:49.264
Thank you so much for this gift,
Ibi, and it's an honor to have 

00:35:49.265 --> 00:35:51.919
you here and present you with an
Americas Award.

00:35:55.351 --> 00:35:57.351
[Applause]

00:36:09.757 --> 00:36:11.757
IBI ZOBOI: Good afternoon, 
everyone.  Thank you so much.

00:36:14.692 --> 00:36:16.692
This is such a huge honor for 
me.

00:36:19.998 --> 00:36:22.155
Thank you to the consortium for 
Latin America studies programs 

00:36:22.156 --> 00:36:24.156
and everyone 

00:36:25.203 --> 00:36:27.203
involved in this award, an award
ceremony.

00:36:30.397 --> 00:36:32.234
I would like to thank my 
publisher, HarperCollins, bad 

00:36:32.235 --> 00:36:34.235
win gray imprint and 

00:36:35.236 --> 00:36:37.236
my

00:36:38.635 --> 00:36:40.876
editors of Alloy Entertainment. 
I thank my family and all the 

00:36:40.877 --> 00:36:42.917
writing programs and workshops 
that got me here.

00:36:45.983 --> 00:36:47.983
I've been writing for 15 years 
and 

00:36:49.052 --> 00:36:51.052
trying to get published.

00:36:53.549 --> 00:36:55.775
"American Street" is my debut 
novel and I'm thrilled and 

00:36:55.776 --> 00:37:00.466
honored to see how it's been 
honored over the last two years,

00:37:00.467 --> 00:37:02.467
the feedback from teachers, 

00:37:04.179 --> 00:37:05.988
librarians and students, and I'm
just overjoyed by the fact that 

00:37:05.989 --> 00:37:07.989
young readers are still 
discovering this story.

00:37:11.801 --> 00:37:13.425
I will share a little bit about 
why -- how "American Street" 

00:37:13.426 --> 00:37:15.426
came to be, why 

00:37:16.479 --> 00:37:18.479
this sort of story is very 
important to 

00:37:19.515 --> 00:37:21.515
me, and most importantly, I'm 
very 

00:37:24.006 --> 00:37:26.006
grateful that I am honored by an
award 

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:30.806
that upholds Latin American 
culture.  I aim a Haitian 

00:37:30.807 --> 00:37:33.678
immigrant.  And Haiti is not a 
Spanish-speaking company.

00:37:37.703 --> 00:37:41.297
It is a Francophone Caribbean 
nation and based on that fact it

00:37:41.298 --> 00:37:43.298
kind of stands out on its own.

00:37:45.164 --> 00:37:46.797
However, it is a Latin American 
country, which I just 

00:37:46.798 --> 00:37:49.230
discovered.  I never considered 
Haiti being part of 

00:37:53.922 --> 00:37:55.345
this larger conversation of 
Spanish-speaking countries or 

00:37:55.346 --> 00:37:57.346
ever associating it to anything 
Latin.

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:03.878
Our history was that of 
revolution, of French 

00:38:03.879 --> 00:38:06.724
colonization and African 
cultural retention.  So only 

00:38:06.725 --> 00:38:08.725
recently did I begin to think 

00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:12.620
about what it means to be a 
Latin 

00:38:14.518 --> 00:38:16.797
American nation and what it 
means to be an Afro Latin X 

00:38:16.798 --> 00:38:18.798
nation.

00:38:22.072 --> 00:38:24.308
My recently published book is 
called "Pride," just a light 

00:38:24.309 --> 00:38:26.309
retelling of the 

00:38:27.561 --> 00:38:29.561
literary classic and it features
a Haitian-Dominican character.

00:38:31.833 --> 00:38:33.833
And as you may or may not know, 
Haiti 

00:38:35.086 --> 00:38:37.086
and Dominican Republic have been
at 

00:38:39.008 --> 00:38:40.856
odds, historical odds, cultural 
odds and, there's a language 

00:38:40.857 --> 00:38:42.857
barrier as well.

00:38:47.009 --> 00:38:49.009
And I was thrilled that 
Elizabeth 

00:38:52.475 --> 00:38:54.475
Acevedo, a Dominican author,

00:38:58.507 --> 00:38:59.730
, in a collaboration we realized
we were healing both of our 

00:38:59.731 --> 00:39:01.731
respective countries.

00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:05.349
So being honored for this award 
that 

00:39:07.429 --> 00:39:09.678
has a title "Latin" in it is 
also -- it means a lot to me, 

00:39:09.679 --> 00:39:11.679
because Haiti in 

00:39:13.585 --> 00:39:15.585
itself can be very isolated from
the 

00:39:17.043 --> 00:39:17.448
larger Caribbean culture and 
within the western hemisphere 

00:39:17.449 --> 00:39:19.449
itself.

00:39:20.722 --> 00:39:22.990
Being dubbed the poorest country
in the western hemisphere, being

00:39:22.991 --> 00:39:24.991
one at of 

00:39:26.454 --> 00:39:28.454
the countries that has the 
closest ties 

00:39:31.538 --> 00:39:33.538
to African culture, and part of 
writing 

00:39:35.206 --> 00:39:37.206
"American Street" was about 
retaining 

00:39:39.289 --> 00:39:41.328
the culture that has been sort 
of bastardized in the western 

00:39:41.329 --> 00:39:43.329
media.

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:47.200
In "American Street," Fabiola 
holds on 

00:39:48.471 --> 00:39:50.471
to her Vodu culture and it meant
a lot 

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:53.540
to make that authentic and real 
and not 

00:39:54.626 --> 00:39:56.626
make our traditions and culture 
a caricature in this novel.

00:40:00.932 --> 00:40:02.932
And when readers and thought 
leaders, 

00:40:04.207 --> 00:40:06.207
teachers and librarians 
recognize that, 

00:40:08.879 --> 00:40:11.147
to me that is sort of a defiance
and a pushback against what the 

00:40:11.148 --> 00:40:14.926
mainstream has been feeding us 
for the last few decades about 

00:40:14.927 --> 00:40:16.927
my home country.

00:40:20.014 --> 00:40:21.648
So, I'm going to share the 
author's note from "American 

00:40:21.649 --> 00:40:23.649
Street," because I only have 
written it.

00:40:26.353 --> 00:40:28.798
I remember it being a tough 
process between my editors and I

00:40:28.799 --> 00:40:30.799
to figure out 

00:40:32.672 --> 00:40:34.705
the hows and why of this story, 
so that when readers turn to the

00:40:34.706 --> 00:40:40.248
last page, whatever it is that 
happens in that last scene in 

00:40:40.249 --> 00:40:42.249
"American Street," there's an 

00:40:43.512 --> 00:40:45.512
author's note for readers to 
kind of 

00:40:46.548 --> 00:40:48.186
unpack what has happened and for
readers to understand my 

00:40:48.187 --> 00:40:51.249
intentions.
One of the things that I really 

00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:53.250
care 

00:40:54.491 --> 00:40:56.491
about is being understood, and I
don't 

00:40:57.967 --> 00:40:59.761
always have authors -- don't 
always have the opportunity to 

00:40:59.762 --> 00:41:01.985
state their intentions in a 
book.  And sometimes we have a 

00:41:01.986 --> 00:41:03.986
certain sort 

00:41:05.316 --> 00:41:09.175
of insecurity in terms of "did I
get my meaning across"?  Did 

00:41:09.176 --> 00:41:11.176
readers understand what I was 
trying to do?

00:41:12.843 --> 00:41:14.843
And sometimes those validations 
come from awards like this.

00:41:17.897 --> 00:41:19.897
And it also comes from the 
committee 

00:41:21.351 --> 00:41:24.197
who planned those awards and 
read other books and put your 

00:41:24.198 --> 00:41:26.198
work up against 

00:41:27.464 --> 00:41:29.505
others' and others that are ral 
qualified as well, and see its 

00:41:29.506 --> 00:41:32.381
value.  So, again, I have to say
thank you.

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:35.390
I have to put this down.

00:41:41.201 --> 00:41:42.422
So while I did not come to this 
country as a 16-year-old, 

00:41:42.423 --> 00:41:45.280
Fabiola did.  I came to this 
country as a four-year-old.

00:41:48.731 --> 00:41:50.572
I moved -- the first 
neighborhood I moved into in New

00:41:50.573 --> 00:41:52.573
York is a neighborhood 

00:41:54.846 --> 00:41:56.455
called Bushwick, Brooklyn, and 
I'll explain a little more about

00:41:56.456 --> 00:41:58.456
Bushwick and 

00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:02.766
what it means to come from such 
a beautiful island -- I think 

00:42:02.767 --> 00:42:05.002
all the Latin Americas are like 
that, tropical, 

00:42:08.685 --> 00:42:10.502
warm, family, love, food, and to
have that American dream and to 

00:42:10.503 --> 00:42:13.354
come from what is considered a 
broken nation by 

00:42:20.337 --> 00:42:22.337
the western media, and many ways
a 

00:42:24.008 --> 00:42:25.427
broken city, Detroit is coming 
back, and the kind of conflict 

00:42:25.428 --> 00:42:28.074
that happens in that sort of 
exchange.

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:34.014
So the first seeds of "American 
Street" were planted when I read

00:42:34.015 --> 00:42:36.015
a New York 

00:42:38.498 --> 00:42:40.498
Times article entitled Last Stop
on the L Train-Detroit.

00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:46.830
It was about the far reaching 
gentrification progression 

00:42:46.831 --> 00:42:51.399
towards Detroit, Michigan.  
Bushwick is the last stop for 

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:54.894
whites and affluent residents 
who won't venture too deep into 

00:42:54.895 --> 00:42:56.895
Brooklyn.

00:43:01.383 --> 00:43:03.383
Bushwick was our first home in 
America.

00:43:04.863 --> 00:43:06.863
I didn't know it then but 1980 

00:43:09.882 --> 00:43:12.538
Bushwick was described as 
resemble a war zone.  While our 

00:43:12.539 --> 00:43:14.539
house on Hancock Street was 

00:43:18.437 --> 00:43:19.650
fairly intact, others were 
littered with torn mattresses 

00:43:19.651 --> 00:43:21.651
and old tires.

00:43:22.908 --> 00:43:25.768
When I read The New York Times 
article, I remember thinking, 

00:43:25.769 --> 00:43:28.258
how does Detroit compare to 
Bushwick I grew up in?

00:43:32.939 --> 00:43:34.939
It seems too many parallels and 
my own 

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:39.050
life as an immigrant and time 
lines of Detroit, I could write 

00:43:39.051 --> 00:43:42.697
a train and tell the story of a 
girl like me who found her way 

00:43:42.698 --> 00:43:46.156
to the other side.
While writing "American Street" 

00:43:46.157 --> 00:43:49.223
I pulled from my own memories of
living in between cultures.

00:43:59.254 --> 00:44:01.254
Experiences and violence that 
many girls have endured.

00:44:05.917 --> 00:44:07.753
Yet more often than not, these 
girls and families leave their 

00:44:07.754 --> 00:44:09.754
home countries only 

00:44:11.009 --> 00:44:13.009
to move to other broken and 
disenfranchised communities.

00:44:15.099 --> 00:44:16.345
I keep thinking about how these 
girls negotiate their own values

00:44:16.346 --> 00:44:18.346
an culture 

00:44:19.808 --> 00:44:21.808
with the need to survive and aim
for the American dream.

00:44:36.122 --> 00:44:37.545
In the George Zimmerman trial I 
recognized a little of myself in

00:44:37.546 --> 00:44:40.782
Rachel.
And in the many Haitian team 

00:44:40.783 --> 00:44:42.783
girls I worked with over the 
years.

00:44:46.912 --> 00:44:48.912
We fold our immigrant selves 
into the 

00:44:50.181 --> 00:44:51.812
veneer we think is African.  The
result is more jagged than 

00:44:51.813 --> 00:44:53.813
smooth.

00:44:54.964 --> 00:44:56.964
Tension between our inherited 
identity 

00:44:58.211 --> 00:45:00.251
and our newly adapted selves 
filters into our relationships 

00:45:00.252 --> 00:45:02.487
with other girls with the boys 
we love and how we 

00:45:06.138 --> 00:45:07.979
interact with the broken places 
around us.  I saw Fabiola and 

00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:11.033
these girls and that's how the 
story was truly born.

00:45:13.679 --> 00:45:15.679
I wanted to give Fabiola a 
strong 

00:45:16.683 --> 00:45:18.923
cultural connection to Haiti so 
that she spiritually is grounded

00:45:18.924 --> 00:45:20.924
when faced with a tough 
decision.

00:45:34.228 --> 00:45:36.257
Vudu has a complex pantheon and 
mythological system like Greek 

00:45:36.258 --> 00:45:39.506
and Roman mythology.
Through Fabiola's eyes her new 

00:45:39.507 --> 00:45:42.355
world and people who inhabit it 
are just as 

00:45:46.211 --> 00:45:48.211
complex and magical as her 
beloved saints and lives.

00:45:49.758 --> 00:45:52.672
She infuses it into everything 
that happens to her.  This is 

00:45:52.673 --> 00:45:54.701
the source of her courage and I 
think she is more American 

00:45:54.702 --> 00:45:56.702
because of it.

00:45:58.157 --> 00:46:00.599
This merging of traditions, this
blending of cultures from one 

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:05.303
broken place to another.
I remember those rides on the L 

00:46:05.304 --> 00:46:07.304
train with my mother very well.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.238
Graffiti covered every inch r 
inch of I once saw a man steal a

00:46:14.239 --> 00:46:18.505
diamond ring right off a woman's
finger.  My mother pulled me 

00:46:18.506 --> 00:46:20.506
close and prayed under her 
breath.

00:46:23.176 --> 00:46:25.008
We made it to the other side 
just like Fabiola.  But what was

00:46:25.009 --> 00:46:28.249
this life?
I don't know what my life would 

00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:32.760
have been like if I had grown up
in Haiti.  But I know this much 

00:46:32.761 --> 00:46:34.813
is true... I would not have told
this story.

00:46:36.657 --> 00:46:39.100
Thank you very much.

00:46:49.071 --> 00:46:51.071
[Applause]

00:46:53.381 --> 00:46:55.381

00:47:33.373 --> 00:47:35.373
The Americas Award is not just a
children's book award but also 

00:47:37.842 --> 00:47:38.655
represents a variety of 
resources for teachers and 

00:47:38.656 --> 00:47:40.656
librarians.

00:47:42.193 --> 00:47:44.627
To commemorate the special 25th 
anniversary, we have put 

00:47:44.628 --> 00:47:48.933
together a comprehensive toolkit
for teachers, librarians and 

00:47:48.934 --> 00:47:50.934
outreach professionals to 

00:47:52.188 --> 00:47:53.215
use as a guide for engaging with
books recognized by the award.

00:47:56.655 --> 00:47:58.497
This toolkit provides classroom 
activities, curriculum, ideas 

00:47:58.498 --> 00:48:00.498
for community events and teacher
workshops, 

00:48:03.548 --> 00:48:06.005
and many other resources and
