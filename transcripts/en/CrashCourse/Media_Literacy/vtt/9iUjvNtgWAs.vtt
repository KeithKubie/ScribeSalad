00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.080
During our last lesson we went way, way back
to Ancient Greece where people were still a bit
wary of the written word.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:17.200
We looked at how the printing press revolutionized
literacy and later, how the newspaper became the
first mass media.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.440
And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.560
At the turn of the 20th century, around the
peak of the penny press wars, another medium
was about to go boom.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.580
The first motion pictures were shown in the
1890’s, and popular culture as we know it took
its first steps off the printed page.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.320
Just three decades later, it would take another
step forward, and then another.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.900
Radio broadcasts soon brought the news, music
and more right into people’s homes.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.720
By the 1950’s television sets joined in.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.380
Just 40 years after that personal computers and the
internet revolutionized the media landscape again.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.660
With each leap forward in technology, new
challenges to media literacy popped up.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:00.620
Before mass media, people were concerned
over access to media – who is literate, what info
can they get, and how do they get it?

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.240
But in first half of the 20th century, concerns
shifted to analyzing and evaluating media.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.820
What messages are being sent, and is the public
able to handle them?

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:17.280
If Martin Luther and Gutenberg worried we didn’t
have enough media around, in the 20th century we
start to worry if people have too much.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:27.540
[Theme Music]

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.420
It’s the 20th century, and everywhere you turn there
are films and radio broadcasts and TV shows.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.360
And lawmakers and educators and parents begin
to resist all these new, popular, mass media.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.900
Often they insisted that the public (and especially
children) were in grave danger.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.500
These organizations and individuals weren’t
the media literacy advocates we think of today,

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.170
encouraging us to dive into the media deep
end and swim around.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.480
They were more like your swim coach covering
you up in floaties before you even reach the pool:
too strict and a little weird.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.560
This type of media literacy is called protectionism.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.540
As modern media scholar David Buckingham describes
it, protectionism comes different forms.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.000
There’s cultural defensiveness, where certain
types of media ares in said to have less cultural
value than others.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.380
There’s political defensiveness, where the
people must be protected from false beliefs
and ideologies.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.740
Then there’s moral defensiveness, where
the effects of sex, violence, and consumerism
in media are the biggest concern.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.640
Cultural defensiveness is maybe best described by
the phrase, “they don’t make ‘em like they used to!”

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.620
Each generation has a moment where what it loves
loses popularity in exchange for something new.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.740
And when that happens, the older generation
often dismisses the newest media product as
less worthwhile.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.980
Television was a big target of this type of
protectionism.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.280
When TV got really popular in 50’s and 60’s,
a wave of academics and educators thought
it would rot everyone’s brains.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:55.400
If you’ve found yourself complaining about youths
and their Snapchats and their Netflix and their selfies,
you have fallen prey to cultural defensiveness.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.860
Political defensiveness is used whenever
someone is worried the media might be secretly
swaying opinion or guiding public action –

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.320
like propaganda, subliminal messages,
claims that candy corn actually tastes good.
That sort of thing.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:14.260
Whenever a new medium exerted power over
the public, fears of its use by foreign agents
to persuade and confuse followed.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.880
By the late 1940’s and early 1950’s, for
instance, there was a lot of hand-wringing
over the power of Hollywood studios.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:27.080
After the First and Second World Wars, government
committees were formed to clear the film industry
of feared communist influence.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.820
Luckily we don’t have to worry about foreign
influence in our media today, right people? Right?

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:38.680
Moral defensiveness focuses on the content of
media, and their ability to “corrupt young minds.”

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.380
This version of protectionism remains a popular
hangout for media literacy advocates.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.580
When a new media trend comes along that
doesn’t jive with their societal norms –

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:55.400
think about violent video games or sexy music
videos or books about boy wizards – moves are
made to “protect the children.”

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.460
Moral defensiveness can lead to a moral panic.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:06.340
Coined by South African sociologist Stanley Cohen,
a moral panic is the reaction of the public to a perceived
threat to social norms.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:13.040
Legislators, educators, and parents learn about,
get concerned by, then act to neutralize that threat.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.100
Those perceived threats are often based on
stereotypes, racism, or sexism.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.800
For instance, moral panics have dogged the
history of popular music, especially music
made by Black Americans.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:29.400
In the 1950’s, Rock n Roll became super
popular with teenagers of all colors and its
most popular figures were black.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.669
This raised fears among some suburban white
parents that it would promote interracial dating
and sexualized behavior.

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:41.520
A similar cycle of moral panic followed the rise
of jazz in the 20’s and rap in the 80’s and 90’s too.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.820
Hip hop, for one, is still sometimes referred
to as “not music.”

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.040
Moral Panics are all about the content of
messages.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.080
Will seeing a movie star smoke make kids smoke?

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.860
Will doin’ the twist on the dance floor
lead to doin’ the twist...elsewhere?

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.240
Luckily, protectionism isn’t the only version
of media literacy.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:09.160
The modern shift in media literacy began in the 1960s,
and started to argue that empowering students to use
media could help them navigate it in the real world.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.930
A good, critical understanding of media could
even make you a better citizen.

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:19.100
A big part of this shift was the work of
Marshall McLuhan, arguably the most popular
media theorist of the 20th century.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:24.700
McLuhan was a true public intellectual, sharing his
theories through TV talk-shows and bestselling books.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:30.720
His famous 1967 book “The Medium is the
Massage,” – whose title was a play on The
Medium is the Message –

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.220
theorized that the way we communicate is more
important than what we communicate.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.240
He wanted media scholars to study the methods
of content delivery, in addition to the content itself.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:46.400
McLuhan wrote, “The personal and social
consequences of any medium – that is, any
extension of ourselves –

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.980
result from the new scale that is introduced
into our affairs...by any new technology.”

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.900
The gist of this theory is that any new medium
changes how we think.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.600
The important part of a message isn’t what
it’s saying.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.440
It’s how its delivery changes our relationship
to the outside world.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.499
Let’s head to the Thought Bubble to break
that down.

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:04.689
Take this Facebook post.

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:06.560
It’s from an acquaintance of yours.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.839
The message of this post?

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.240
Well, it’s your acquaintance’s mom’s
birthday! Very exciting!

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.940
Of course, they never straight up say, “My
mom was born on this day many years ago”

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.320
But you get it from the photo and the cutesy
caption.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.060
But let’s look beyond the message.

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.080
Before Facebook, would you have known the
birthday of a not-so-close friend’s mom?

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.240
Probably not.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.960
So, why’d they post it on Facebook, specifically?

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.040
Maybe they knew their mom would see it and
it would make her day brighter.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.680
Maybe they knew other people would see it
and wish their mom a happy birthday.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:39.480
Maybe, they knew their whole family would
see it, and they’d look like the best child ever.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.060
Why the cutesy photo?

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:43.099
Well, that’s how everyone is doing it these
days.

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:45.340
You can’t just write, “Happy b-day mom.”

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.839
That sounds a little stale or even robotic.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.980
What if all your Facebook friends scroll right
past that tiny text message? The horror!

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:56.640
So you pick out a retro photo of you and your
mom looking adorbs. Totally normal.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:02.860
Since Facebook was born, generations have
formed new habits around sharing of info online
with friends and family.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:08.540
Facebook as a medium has influenced not
only what people say, but when and how they
say it, and to whom.

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:13.020
As McLuhan would say, we shape our tools and
then our tools shape us.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:18.029
This is a crucial point to modern media literacy:
it’s not just the messages that affect us.

00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:19.469
It’s the platforms, too.

00:07:19.469 --> 00:07:20.779
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:29.720
So as media literacy blossomed, scholars started
to study how media perpetuate stereotypes and
reinforce social inventions like race and gender.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.260
As knowledge of these media effects grew,
the focus of the field shifted again.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:41.120
Instead of protecting consumers from media
messages, media literacy now seeks to prepare
them to receive and create them.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.560
Advocates are asking: when do consumers become
creators?

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.500
How do media help audiences make decisions?

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.700
How can help we empower media users from a
young age?

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:57.740
As technology makes media usage ubiquitous
and all-consuming, digital literacy and news
literacy have become critical tools.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:06.820
Digital literacy is the set of skills required to use
digital media; knowing how to access the internet,
how to send an email, or what a meme is.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:11.420
But also, how to avoid getting Catfished,
or avoiding addiction to your mobile apps.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:16.440
News literacy is the set of skills needed
to navigate news media specifically;

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:21.260
what sources are trustworthy, how to share
news responsibly, and how news is gathered.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:28.740
But also, in the age of “fake news,” what
truth means and how to avoid the “filter
bubble” of like-minded internet users.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:35.600
Finally, as social media continue to take
up more of our media time, their influence
on democracy has become a hot topic.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:42.540
Right this second, media literacy educators are
teaching future generations of voters how to take
action on the media they consume.

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:48.620
And activists and scholars are fighting for
net neutrality and industry regulations to
ensure the free flow of information.

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:53.480
Media literacy and its goals have continued
to shift and adapt to changing times.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:09:00.360
When media is “new,” cycles of concern about its threat
to safety, culture, and well-being repeat across the ages.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.960
And with each new medium comes a new need
and a new skill set to learn.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:12.100
But with some critical thinking and the right
combination of historical context and tech savvy,
we’re always prepared to forge ahead into the future.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:21.620
We’ll continue that forge next time on Crash
Course: Media Literacy as we dive into how our brains
react to information – in helpful and hurtful ways.

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.260
Until then, I’m Jay Smooth.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:27.420
Crash Course Media Literacy is filmed in the
Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney Studio in Missoula, MT.

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:31.340
It’s made with the help of all of these nice people,
and our animation team is Thought Cafe.

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.240
