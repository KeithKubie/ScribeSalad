00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:01.835
[music playing]

00:00:01.835 --> 00:00:03.803
NARRATOR: In
Montana's Yaak Valley,

00:00:03.803 --> 00:00:05.805
Tom and Sean are
laying a trap for one

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:08.641
of the northern Rockies'
most fearsome predators,

00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:10.310
the gray wolf.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.747
The wolf population
has come up so high,

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:16.383
and they eat lots of meat.

00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:17.684
NARRATOR: At the
sight of a kill that's

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:19.719
less than six hours old--

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:21.621
TOM: Lots of times, you'll
find the dead animal

00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:23.356
after it's all eaten
and everything,

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:25.458
but this one hasn't been eaten.

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:30.530
So there's a real, real big
chance they'll come back.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.332
So we're going to
put a couple of traps

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:35.535
on the trails coming in here.

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:36.770
What are you thinking?

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.471
These tracks are
going that way.

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:40.006
We put one--

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:41.741
- Base of that tree there?
- Mm-hm.

00:00:44.677 --> 00:00:45.912
SEAN: It's a
challenging, challenging

00:00:45.912 --> 00:00:47.881
thing, catching a gray wolf.

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:50.517
Sean don't know a lot
about all the different

00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:52.552
types of fur-bearers,
but one thing

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:54.821
that Sean does know is wolves.

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:57.791
Let's try and get one
in a footprint here.

00:00:57.791 --> 00:01:01.961
I'm using a set, where it's
anchored off to a tree.

00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:03.730
NARRATOR: The exploding
wolf population

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.833
is a threat to humans,
but also to game animals

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:10.303
that stand to be wiped out of an
area once a wolf pack moves in.

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:14.674
You don't want too
much chain, because then

00:01:14.674 --> 00:01:16.309
they can get too
much speed, momentum,

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:17.377
and maybe jump a trap.

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:19.712
So I got about a
seven foot chain.

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:21.347
And in the snow
like this, you can

00:01:21.347 --> 00:01:23.650
hide a lot of this stuff in
this nice, soft snow like this,

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.685
nice and dry.

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:28.755
I also have a bag
on my trap here,

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:30.890
and that kind of keeps
the mechanisms of the trap

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.659
from freezing under the snow.

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.228
And the bags are nice
and thin, so they

00:01:35.228 --> 00:01:38.531
don't make a bunch of noise
when the wolf first steps on it.

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:39.999
And I'll just set
that right out there

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:44.604
in the main intersection track.

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:46.639
You always want to be
as neat as possible.

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:49.409
I'm always a little
jumpy about standing

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.912
anywhere near these sets.

00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:56.149
Touching anything, I
wear my rubber gloves.

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.220
If you leave any scent
there of human activity,

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.357
wolves can smell things like
that, and you won't catch them.

00:02:04.357 --> 00:02:07.093
We want it to be
invisible to them,

00:02:07.093 --> 00:02:10.663
but you also don't want
too much snow on the trap,

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:12.532
because it won't fire.

00:02:12.532 --> 00:02:14.400
Looks good.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.371
You get out of here the same
way I came in, let it all sit

00:02:18.371 --> 00:02:21.674
and chill out for a day, and
we should get back in here.

00:02:21.674 --> 00:02:22.375
They're close.

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:23.076
That's right.

00:02:23.076 --> 00:02:24.210
They are in here.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.746
These wolves, we got to
keep on handle on them.

00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:28.748
They're killing the hell
out of our big game,

00:02:28.748 --> 00:02:31.985
and we just got to
control them now.

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:33.920
Well, we got a good
chance of catching them.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.788
All right, ready?
