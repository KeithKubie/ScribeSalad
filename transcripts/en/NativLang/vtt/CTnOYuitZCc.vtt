Dude,

2
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.640
<v 1>let's build on our previous understanding of morphemes in word classes as we</v>

3
00:00:13.641 --> 00:00:18.440
move on to the particle. This class is in some ways a catchall category.

4
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.730
It includes a lot of little words that have some real function but not a lot of

5
00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:25.610
content. Meaning they include conjunctions,

6
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.650
they include interjections like look that express more emotional content than

7
00:00:30.651 --> 00:00:31.670
semantic content.

8
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.600
They also included type of word that's a little bit trickier to handle.

9
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.070
Many languages use small grammatical words that sit next to the word.

10
00:00:40.071 --> 00:00:43.880
They relate to. An example would be a preposition in English.

11
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.860
What we know is prepositions usually describes some spatial or temporal relation

12
00:00:48.861 --> 00:00:52.910
like above the table, below the table beside the table.

13
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.980
These are all prepositions.

14
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.090
The name actually doesn't come from anything to do with their meaning.

15
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.800
It comes from the fact that they have to sit right before pre the noun that they

16
00:01:03.801 --> 00:01:08.801
are placed next to pose any type of grammatical word that works this way is

17
00:01:08.841 --> 00:01:10.610
known as in ad position.

18
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.930
The name ad position just relates that the word is placed next to another word.

19
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.730
A preposition is placed before a post position is placed afterwards.

20
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.820
I've already mentioned a few prepositions in English,

21
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.200
but prepositions don't have to mark space or time relative to someone or

22
00:01:27.201 --> 00:01:31.700
something in other languages. In Hawaiian for instance, prepositions,

23
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.630
Marcus' subject, the preposition, oh, Mark's a subject.

24
00:01:35.631 --> 00:01:39.770
Whereas the preposition e marks and object. Here are two examples.

25
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.230
Here we see an example of a language using prepositions to mark a grammatical

26
00:01:45.231 --> 00:01:46.760
feature we've talked about before,

27
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.670
so keep your eyes open for languages that do this,

28
00:01:49.671 --> 00:01:54.671
that use ad positions rather than say inflectional affixes in Japanese,

29
00:01:55.791 --> 00:01:58.130
the subject marker guy and the object Marker,

30
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.940
Oh appear after the words that they mark as subject and object.

31
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.260
So they seem to work like post positions at first glance and in both the

32
00:02:06.261 --> 00:02:07.970
Hawaiian and Japanese examples,

33
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.970
we have particles that play the role of marking case for nouns.

34
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.060
Another group of words,

35
00:02:14.061 --> 00:02:19.061
sometimes classed as a type of particle is the article articles include

36
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.310
indefinite articles like a or an English and the definite article V in English.

37
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.970
The classification is tricky because articles may exhibit many of the properties

38
00:02:28.971 --> 00:02:33.320
of adjectives as well. This very quick overview of particles,

39
00:02:33.321 --> 00:02:34.910
just introduced the concept,

40
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.840
but keep particles in mind as you move on to the next lesson where we'll start

41
00:02:38.841 --> 00:02:41.780
putting together all the classes of words we've met so far.
