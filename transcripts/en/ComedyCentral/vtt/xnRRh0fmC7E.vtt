00:00:01.902 --> 00:00:03.971
- BLINK 182 OR 311?

00:00:04.037 --> 00:00:05.105
- 311.

00:00:05.172 --> 00:00:06.874
- 311'S A GOOD BAND.
- YEAH.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:08.509
- HERE WE ARE
AT THE SCENE OF THE CRIME.

00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:11.078
THIS IS WHERE I WAITED
FOR ANGEL AND MATTHEW.

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:12.312
THEY NEVER
SHOWED UP,

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:14.248
AND SO I SLICED UP
THOSE TIRES.

00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:16.216
SLASH.
RETRIBUTION.

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:18.952
MY BOY ANGEL
DOES SOUND FOR ME.

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.687
HE DOES A BAD JOB

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:22.623
'CAUSE HE'S TOO BUSY
SMOKING METH ALL DAY.

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.458
I SAID, "ANGEL,
GET OFF THAT TINA.

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:25.759
GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER."

00:00:25.826 --> 00:00:27.394
HE SAID, "NO, I'M GONNA DO
WHAT I DO."

00:00:27.461 --> 00:00:29.162
I SAID,
"YOU LEAVE ME ALONE.

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:30.697
"I'M NOT GONNA
TAKE THIS TONIGHT.

00:00:30.764 --> 00:00:32.766
"'CAUSE IF WE
GO IN THE AREA TONIGHT,

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:34.201
"WE GONNA HAVE FUN.

00:00:34.268 --> 00:00:35.602
"AND I DON'T WANT TO
THINK ABOUT WORK

00:00:35.669 --> 00:00:36.803
WHEN I'M NOT AT WORK."

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.639
AND ANGEL'S LIKE,
"NO, NO, NO.

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:40.641
I WORK FOR YOU.
I DON'T WORK FOR ANYBODY."

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:42.109
I SAID,
"YOU DON'T WORK FOR ME.

00:00:42.176 --> 00:00:43.343
NOT ANYMORE."

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.811
YOU KNOW?
ISN'T THAT--

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:47.014
ISN'T THAT THE TRUTH
WHEN YOU WORK WITH FRIENDS?

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.282
- WHAT THIS IS?
