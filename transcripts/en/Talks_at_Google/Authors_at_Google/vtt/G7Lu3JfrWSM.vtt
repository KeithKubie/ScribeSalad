JACQUELLINE FULLER:
Welcome everybody.

00:00:02.496 --> 00:00:05.200
It's so good to have a
great turn-out today.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.050
I'm Jacquelline Fuller, and
I run Google Giving.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.310
And it's a real pleasure today
to introduce someone who's

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.600
become a friend, and is one of
the leading lights of the

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.900
whole technology and social
media sector.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.360
I'm going to read a little bit
from Beth's background.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.370
So her first book, "A Networked
Nonprofit,"

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.850
introduced the sector to a new
way of thinking and operating

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:27.630
in a connected world.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.780
She built on that in her second
book, which we have

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:36.560
over here for sale, "Measuring
the Networked Nonprofit." Got

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.340
the two biggest memes in the
nonprofit movement--

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.100
measurement and networking
in the same title.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.165
BETH KANTER: And data
in the subtitle.

00:00:43.165 --> 00:00:44.640
JACQUELLINE FULLER: And data--
oh, in the subtitle.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.190
BETH KANTER: Using
data to change--

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.600
JACQUELLINE FULLER: Using data
to change the world.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.250
You should have said Big Data,
and that would have been

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.400
really funny.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.770
Awesome.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.180
Using data to change
the world.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.370
She's also the author of one of
the most popular books in

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.740
the entire nonprofit space, "How
Nonprofits Can Use Social

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:03.860
Media."

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.820
She's got over 30 years in
the nonprofit sector.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.260
She's done training.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.470
She builds capacities.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.480
She's facilitating nonprofits
learning about these themes of

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.260
networking and management
across the globe.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.180
She was named one of most
influential women in

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.450
technology by Fast Company,
and one of Business Week's

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.420
"Voices of Innovation"
for social media.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.150
She's a visiting scholar at the
David and Lucile Packard

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.470
Foundation, as well.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.370
And one last thing I want to
say about my friend Beth is

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.373
that when I was having lunch
with another colleague whose

00:01:38.373 --> 00:01:40.950
in the space of technology and
social impact, and said I was

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.242
going to introduce Beth, she
said, oh, tell them this--

00:01:45.242 --> 00:01:47.995
that whenever someone comes to
me who is maybe new to the

00:01:47.995 --> 00:01:50.800
sector or interested in learning
more about technology

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.350
and nonprofits and social
impact, the first thing she

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.800
always tells them is to
follow Beth Kanter.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.310
So with that, I'll turn
it over to my friend.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.270
BETH KANTER: Great.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.120
Thank you, Jacqueline.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.880
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.290
Thank you, Jacqueline, for
that great introduction.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.009
And it's such a pleasure to
be here with all of you.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.770
And I want to give a big
shout-out to the VISTA folks

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.770
who I had the pleasure
of having lunch with.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.500
And I always like talking
to young people.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.220
I've been in the nonprofit
sector for 34 years.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.600
That's how I got my start.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.700
And 20 years ago, almost to
the day, I had a front row

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.930
seat at the creation
of a field--

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.840
how nonprofits can use the
internet for social change.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.680
How exciting is that?

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.470
And so, I was telling someone at
lunch, I said, I've always

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.930
been driven by my curiosity.

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.040
I didn't have a brand
career plan.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.400
I just followed my passion, and
followed my curiosity, and

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.690
desire to learn.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.270
And when I started my first
technology job, I didn't know

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.180
a modem from a microwave.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.690
OK, you're supposed to laugh.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.970
But I was able to learn from the
techies, translate that,

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.970
and help activists and NGOs and
non-profits learn how to

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.540
embrace this technology.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.650
And I've been lucky to
make that my calling

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:09.900
for the last 20 years.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.250
And I've worked with thousands
of non-profits literally on

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.060
all continents of the world, and
people who are passionate

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.930
about that question of, how
can we use this online

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.970
technology for social change?

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.680
And that's what drives me.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.610
But I also have a personal
passion, and a personal

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.490
commitment to service, like
all of you in VISTA.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.300
And I have a personal connection
to Cambodia, and

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.320
that's why I'm contributing my
royalties to spend that young

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.100
lady, [? Kio Savan ?], who's now
entering her junior year

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.290
at college as a civil
engineering major.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.560
And that will change her life.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.440
And I had an opportunity to
meet her last summer.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.810
And she said to me,
Miss Beth--

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.700
she calls me "Miss Beth,"
sometimes "Mama"--

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.860
thank you very much
for your support.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.320
It's very important to me, but I
would like to go to graduate

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.920
school in the United States, and
I would like to go to MIT,

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.870
Stanford, or Harvard.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.330
I said, OK, we'll sell
a lot of books.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.810
So I was a really, really proud
that the book won this

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.050
year's Terry McAdam's Nonprofit
Book Award.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.130
It's sort of a highlight
of my career.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.470
And it was a bittersweet victory
for me, because the

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:32.500
week that they announced the
finalist, my dad, Earl Kanter,

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.650
passed away--

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.210
gave up this courageous battle
with Parkinson's.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.450
But I felt blessed that I was
able to share that with one

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.300
last professional achievement
with him.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.960
And to honor his memory, I did
a social fundraising at an

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.200
online event and I used--

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.511
I ate my own dog food.

00:04:52.511 --> 00:04:54.780
I used the ideas in my book.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.780
And so he gives us all the final
lesson on how to use

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.090
these tools, and get
better results.

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.510
And I'll share that with
you at the end of the

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.980
presentation.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.970
So let's get to it.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.670
My first book, "The Networked
Nonprofit," co-authored with

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.380
Allison Fine, was about how
nonprofits needed to transform

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.490
themselves from nonprofits
to networked nonprofits.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.860
And the definition is that
networked nonprofits are

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.240
agile, they are adaptive,
they're transparent.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.660
And they're masters at using
their networks, and experts at

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.540
using social media to build
relationships with

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.890
stakeholders, and to make the
world a better place.

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.470
Now what I've learned in
practice as a trainer and a

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.650
capacity-builder is that
adapting this new way of

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.140
working happens very slowly
and incrementally.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.210
So I came up with a maturity of
practice model, and it was

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.050
inspired by this Martin
Luther King quote.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.310
I keep it on my computer.

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.265
I love it.

00:05:55.265 --> 00:05:58.260
It's, "If you can't
fly, then run.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.720
If you can't run, then walk.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.790
If you can't walk, then crawl.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.490
But you have to keep moving
forward," OK?

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.710
So when I work with nonprofits,
I see where they

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.750
are in their transformation to

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.860
becoming a networked nonprofit.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.630
So we have the crawlers.

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:16.990
And there's nothing wrong
with crawling.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.550
Crawling's good.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.040
You have to start somewhere.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.200
How many of you are parents?

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.450
Few.

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.770
OK, when your kid started to
crawl, did you say that's bad?

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:25.930
No, no, no.

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.090
OK, so crawling--

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.740
they may need to develop a
communication strategy,

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:34.680
formalize it, outreach strategy,
or there may be some

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.480
organizational culture
issues, OK?

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.670
But then quickly, they
can get to walking.

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:41.970
And at walking stage, they begin
to link their social

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.570
media and network use with
results, but they're doing it

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:47.040
in terms of pilots--

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.440
experimenting with one program,
one campaign, or even

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.630
one channel.

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:55.870
And here, also, they are
building incremental capacity.

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:59.380
Typically, I see nonprofits
maybe invest up to 20 hours

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.410
per week of staff time at
that walking stage.

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.730
And then there's a chasm that
they cross to get to running.

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:08.050
That does require more
staff investment.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:12.000
But at this point, they have a
formal ladder of engagement.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.720
So they know how to take their
supporters from passive

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.770
observers to champions
for their cause.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:21.480
They have a robust content
and engagement strategy.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.150
They have practice to experiment
and to learn how to

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.590
apply and use new platforms
and new techniques.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:32.930
And they use some measurement in
that-- maybe not throughout

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:34.380
the organization.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.460
But to get to flying--

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.010
at the flying stage, they've
built their network.

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:41.500
Yay-- they have many champions
and influencers supporting

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.400
their work, and spreading their
ideas and messages.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:49.050
They have multi-channel
engagement with their content,

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:52.950
and they are measuring those.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:58.470
And they also have a formal
reflection, and a continuous

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:01.680
improvement process throughout
the whole organization.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.440
So crawl, walk, run, fly.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:08.320
And the framework that's in the
book breaks down 12 best

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.140
practices in becoming a
networked nonprofit, and looks

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.340
at them at different
stages of maturity.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:17.540
And organizations can use this
to help move them one step

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.840
forward at a time.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.370
The book, of course, takes
a deeper dive into the

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:23.830
measurement practices.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:28.110
And that's what we're going
to look at right now.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:31.580
So one of the big ideas in the
book is about, how do you

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:35.470
become a data-informed
nonprofit?

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:38.850
And notice, I'm not using
the word "data-driven"--

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:40.860
the phrase "data-driven"--

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:44.990
because "data-informed" means
that the organization has a

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:47.740
culture of measurement, and
a culture of learning.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:51.270
And they bring their wisdom
and their data to

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:52.490
decision-makings.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:56.680
They're not driven by the data,
and they're collecting

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.320
and using the right data.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.250
So I have three stories about
nonprofits, and somehow they

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.970
all ended up being animal
welfare organization.

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:08.040
So how many people like dogs?

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.160
OK, how many like cats?

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.840
OK, how many like other?

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.890
OK, I'm sure we don't have
any animal haters in

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:15.940
the audience, right?

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:19.990
OK, so there will be
a story for you.

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:22.620
And my first story is about an
organization that I just love.

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.420
It's called DoSomething.org.

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:25.710
How many of you are familiar
with them?

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:27.520
They are awesome, OK?

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:33.940
Their mission is to get over
15 million teens active in

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.500
social change causes.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.130
And they are my poster child
for being a data-informed

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:39.630
organization.

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:43.180
I got have an in-depth profile
in the book, but what I

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:46.110
learned about that is that it
really starts at the top.

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:50.800
OK, so five years ago, people
on their board, like Reid

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.840
Hoffman and DJ Patil,
who is the data

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.130
scientist at LinkedIn--

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:59.070
sat down with Nancy Loveland,
who is their CEO, and sort of

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:00.320
said, lose your gut.

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:05.150
All decisions should be
based on saying, what

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:06.470
does the data say?

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:08.220
But they didn't just say that.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.110
They talked to her about
building the infrastructure

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:13.140
and the culture for
that to happen.

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:15.740
Now what's really amazing,
if you go and visit

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.820
DoSomething.org at their
office in New

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:19.330
York, you will discover--

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:21.890
even though they have a somewhat
small staff in the

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:23.100
nonprofit sector--

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:26.845
that they have three full-time
data scientists on staff.

00:10:26.845 --> 00:10:30.790
And those data scientists, don't
just sit in the corner

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:32.520
and play with their
spreadsheets, and don't talk

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:33.560
to anybody.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.400
They have an open office
space, and they are

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.370
collaborating with staff.

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:42.050
When they have a team to launch
a campaign, they have

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:44.340
to creatives, they have the
mobile team, they have the

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:47.990
social media team, and they
had to data person so that

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:50.200
they're always learning, and
that they're always measuring

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.310
their results.

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:54.790
And two of the mantras that I
picked up while I was there

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:56.510
were this-- and I thought
they were fantastic.

00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:00.530
The first one is, tear down
those silos around data.

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:01.520
OK, it's not--

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.040
I'm the fundraising department,
and you

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.350
can't have my data.

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:07.130
It's everybody working
together.

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:09.350
And the other one that I thought
was quite profound,

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:12.180
and has really changed my whole
measurement practice,

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:15.540
was, spend more time thinking
about what the data means than

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.220
collecting the data.

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:18.660
So let me give you an
example of one of

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.050
their recent campaigns.

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:24.060
And here's where the animal
story comes in.

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:28.400
They launched a campaign based
on some research where they

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.500
found out that a lot of pets
were languishing in shelters

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.340
and being killed, because why?

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:36.390
Why do you think?

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:39.760
Because there weren't enough
great pictures of the pets

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.880
being shared online and
on social channels.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.720
So they built this app where
they could recruit young

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:50.560
people to go into shelters, and
take pictures of the pets,

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.800
and then share them online
with their friends, and

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.630
encourage them to adopt the
animals, to do fundraisers for

00:11:56.630 --> 00:12:00.560
the shelter, or just raise
awareness around these pets.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:05.270
So they'd launched the program
on the Today Show, OK?

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:07.300
And so, whenever I tell
this story, I

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:08.650
usually hear a [GASP].

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:11.090
But they got on the Today Show,
and there's this cute

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:13.630
little, cuddly, squirmy
little puppy.

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:17.010
And Kathy Lee drops
him on his head.

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:18.640
No, the puppy was OK.

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.570
But what happened is that, of
course, it got captured, it

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:26.270
got put on YouTube, a video of
it happening in fast motion,

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:31.160
slow motion, forwards,
backwards, sport annotation on

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.540
it, and bloggers picked it up.

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:36.540
But what's important here is
that first sentence that says,

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:40.220
today, DoSomething.org
launched a program.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:45.050
That link over to the landing
page, all of a sudden-- and I

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:47.510
was in the office when
this happened--

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:48.920
a lot of people started
clicking.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:50.430
It happened on national TV.

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.530
The data scientists went out
into a room, and they were

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:56.620
actually looking in real time
about the conversion rate.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:59.050
How many people were downloading
the app?

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:00.930
How come they-- and they were
brainstorming how they can

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:02.640
improve the landing page.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:08.690
So that's data-informed
at its essence.

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:11.200
And of course, they have
now the results.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.060
It wasn't just a matter of
people getting to that landing

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:15.490
page and downloading the app.

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:18.460
They had ways to measure each
rung on that ladder of

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:22.400
engagement, from finding out
about it on the Today Show up

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:26.730
to young people helping and
facilitating or adopting pets,

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:29.600
and less pets being killed.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.720
All right, so this next
story is about a

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.110
more traditional nonprofit.

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:34.690
The Humane Society of the US.

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:36.500
How many of you know
their work?

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:40.570
OK, so that's Carrie Lewis, and
her dog Bella, who's also

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.350
featured in the book.

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:45.770
And Carrie and the Humane
Society are early adopters of

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:46.450
social media.

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:48.550
They were kind of the
front-runners in the field

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:51.060
five or six years ago when
people were still saying,

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:53.390
what's a blog, and
then when adults

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:55.260
weren't allowed on Facebook.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:59.150
OK, so Carrie's been
an early adapter.

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:02.190
And I had her take the crawl,
walk, run, fly assessment.

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:04.790
And I said, yeah, Carrie,
I bet you're running,

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:06.110
or flying at least.

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:09.860
And she said, you know what, I
think we're trying to scale

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:10.910
being data-informed.

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:13.790
I think we're in the walking
to jogging stage.

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:16.180
And part of it had to do
with the silos in their

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:19.580
organizations, and the ability
to share data, and to share

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:21.940
insights about what was
happening in their campaigns.

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:25.110
So they decided to start a pilot
where they would bring

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:27.040
people from different teams,
and they would

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.790
actually do a debrief--

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:31.100
bringing their data, looking
at what worked in the

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:34.370
campaign, what didn't work, and
what they're going to try

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:37.090
for the next campaign, and
generate something called the

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:39.780
What Worked, and What
Didn't Work report.

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:42.830
And now this is starting
to spread within their

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:43.600
organization.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.090
So more teams are doing this.

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:50.600
And one of the stories that
she also told me-- it was

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.670
great-- how of you know
what a swear jar is?

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:56.310
OK, like if you have kids and
you swear, you're supposed to

00:14:56.310 --> 00:15:00.300
put some money in the swear
jar and not swear.

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:04.100
OK, so they created this thing
called the source code jar.

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:06.010
And let me tell you the
genesis of that.

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:10.330
Back in 2011, they wanted to
measure the conversion rate

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.880
from social media
to fundraising.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:15.150
Like, how many people heard
about us on Facebook, and then

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:17.140
came over and made a donation?

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:18.620
What's our conversion rate?

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:20.456
Well, they couldn't track it.

00:15:20.456 --> 00:15:22.510
Did you know why?

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:24.640
Because the web department
didn't want to use Google

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.750
Analytics source codes.

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:28.470
It was too much trouble.

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:31.600
So Carrie convinced them
to try a few pilots--

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:32.790
try it, let's see.

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:36.270
And then her team was able to
report back what they were

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:37.230
able to learn from it.

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:40.800
And the web team got so excited
that they started the

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:41.930
source code jar.

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:44.860
And that any campaign that
didn't have a Google Analytics

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:47.030
source code would have
to pay a fine.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:49.970
And Carrie's happy to report
that they never got enough

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:51.920
money to go out for
ice cream or beer.

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.720
All right, last story.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:57.270
And this one is about Upwell.

00:15:57.270 --> 00:16:01.510
up is an ocean conservation
organization that works with a

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:05.720
network of ocean conservation
organizations, OK?

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:11.610
And they have adapted the lean
analytics, lean startup mode

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:14.310
for the way that they measure
and learn from their social

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:15.600
media campaigns.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.570
So what they do, they
do a lot of

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:19.490
something called big listening.

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:23.220
They use a program called
Radian6, and they look at the

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:25.330
social chatter that's out
there, and they look for

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:29.480
opportunities around ocean
conservation conversations.

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:32.800
So once they find them, they
package content with their

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.270
partners, and then they launch
their campaign as a

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:40.530
conversation with the metric
of increasing the share of

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:44.180
conversation about the
particular cause--

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:46.540
whether it's ocean
acidification--

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:47.580
I said it--

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:49.100
or shark conservation.

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:52.670
They measure their impact, they
learn, and they spread

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:55.930
those lessons out to the
network, rinse, and repeat.

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:59.010
So let me show you
one example.

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:02.700
OK, so are there any data
people in the room?

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:05.390
OK, data people just
love this.

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:08.329
OK, so what you're looking at--
all the different colors

00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:11.220
represent keywords that relate
to their causes--

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:14.790
ocean, acidification,
sustainable seafood, sharks,

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:18.780
whales, tuna, over-fishing.

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:22.640
And they use a keyword
methodology so they can fetter

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:26.079
out someone who mentions "Ocean
City, Maryland," versus

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:27.420
"save the ocean.

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:29.740
And they look at the amount of
chatter that's happening

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:30.900
around those key words.

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:35.175
And as you can see, the pink
ones is the word "shark." And

00:17:35.175 --> 00:17:37.040
like, oh my god, more shark.

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:39.980
Why was there a spike in
chatter around sharks?

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:40.600
Can you guess?

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:41.010
AUDIENCE: During Shark Week.

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:42.185
BETH KANTER: Oh, you know.

00:17:42.185 --> 00:17:44.150
OK, Shark Week.

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:45.720
Who watches shark week?

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:49.000
OK, all right.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.610
Watch it once, and
you'll get your

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:51.940
explanation on what it is.

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:54.350
But so, a lot of people
are tweeting with

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:56.290
this hashtag, sharkweek.

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:58.750
OK, so they went in
for deep dive--

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:00.730
no pun intended.

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:04.265
And OK, so what's the sentiment
of these people who

00:18:04.265 --> 00:18:05.890
are tweeting around
shark week?

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:08.800
What is the nature of what
they're saying related to

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.250
shark conservation?

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:14.440
So we have "jaws." Oh
my god, sharks, get

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.780
me out of the water.

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:20.340
We have "save the sharks,"
which is their people.

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:21.960
Those are the people who already
know and care about

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.280
shark conservation.

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.830
And then we have,
"yay sharks"--

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:26.100
shark lovers.

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:30.060
And that's what represented
their opportunity here.

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:34.540
Can we get the yay-shark people
tweeting and passing

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:37.310
information, and talking about
shark conservation?

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:38.720
So they worked with
their partners.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.950
They did something called a
sharkinar, which is a webinar

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:43.200
where they brought
them together.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.080
They talked about what content
they could share, what tweets,

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:49.800
what links they could share,
and they let them loose.

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.730
They had measured a benchmark
of what the conversation was

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:55.870
before, and they looked
at what it was after.

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:59.900
And did they increase the
shark conservation

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:00.690
conversation?

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:03.480
Yes, they did, with
the knitting.

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:08.210
So those are just three stories
of nonprofits that our

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:13.270
data-informed, and probably
flyers, or getting to flying.

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:17.280
So let me talk a little bit
about some practice.

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.690
Like rolling up your sleeves,
some practical things, some

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:22.280
principles, practices
of measurement.

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:23.930
And I'm going to go into the--

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:27.870
and no, I'm not going to talk
about multi-variant analysis.

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:30.610
I'm not going to talk in detail
about actually how to

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:31.740
set up a source code.

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:35.510
I'm really going to talk about
good measurement practice in

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:38.970
an organization,
in a nonprofit.

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:43.480
OK, so I go back
and show you--

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.280
one of the things I wanted to do
in the book was one of the

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:48.000
initial things that I
discovered when I

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.490
was doing my research.

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:54.240
And I was lucky enough while I
was at Packard that I had 60

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:57.770
Packard grantees testing the
frameworks that were in the

00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:00.040
book while we were writing
the book to

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.610
generate the case studies.

00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:03.810
I'm not sure I'll
do that again.

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:06.870
But we were in real time saying,
is this something that

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:08.480
you would do in your
organization?

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.560
Is it easy to do?

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:11.080
Is it hard to do?

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.370
Is it working for you, or not?

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:15.910
And so, we adjusted the
framework slightly, and then

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:18.390
it also produced all
of the case studies

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:20.940
that are in the book.

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:23.540
But all of that aside, when I
first got into it, there were

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.330
a lot of people who were
afraid of measurement.

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:28.470
Maybe they flunked math or
whatever, but they had this

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:29.540
fear of measurement.

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:33.680
So I had measurement cartoons
grace each chapter.

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:35.940
And this one says, "I know
it's hard to measure

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:38.660
engagement, but there has to
be a better way," to make

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:42.250
people laugh and feel at ease,
because my ultimate goal was

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:46.280
to turn help nonprofits love and
embrace measurement, which

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:49.040
would in turn improve
their outcomes.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:53.910
So the first thing is having a
measurement discipline, OK?

00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:55.770
I come across a lot of
nonprofits where there are

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:58.170
collecting data, but there's no
framework behind the data

00:20:58.170 --> 00:20:59.700
to help them think about it.

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:03.610
So the book has a whole chapter
on Katie Paine, who

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:07.280
was my co-author's Seven
Steps of Measurement.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:08.890
Pretty straightforward.

00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:11.040
Starting with the goal, looking
at your audience,

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:14.580
cost, benchmark, KPI, picking
your tool, getting some

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:17.100
insight, rinse and repeat.

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:20.370
So one of the things that
sometimes is most

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:22.410
demystifying--

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:25.790
it's not so hard to define
what success is, or what

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:28.470
outcomes nonprofits want to
reach, because it relates back

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:30.090
to their mission.

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:32.750
But the complicated part is
whittling it down, and

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:35.930
figuring, what is the most
important data point that's

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:38.530
going to tell us that
we're successful?

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:42.240
And I use a phrase in the book
called-- it's not a KPI, which

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.050
is a key performance
indicator.

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:48.690
It's a KBI, which is a kicking
butt indicator.

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:52.170
OK, so what you need to do
is to gather a group--

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:54.650
your team, people in
the organization--

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:56.960
who are working on the project,
and talk about, what

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.420
does success look like?

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:01.500
And then, what's going to tell
us that, hey, we're kicking

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:04.800
butt on this, or we're getting
our butts kicked?

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:09.170
And picking that one metric
that matters to know that

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:10.120
you're successful.

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.570
Takes some discipline.

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:14.300
And that whiteboard
is actually from

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.200
the ACLU of New Jersey.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.720
But they said, we're just
reading your book, we're

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.910
reading this chapter about the
kicking butt index, and we're

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:21.890
in the room.

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:23.590
We're here, and look
what we did.

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:24.550
This is what we discussed.

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:25.800
And it works.

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:29.420
The other thing that I hear
when I go out and

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:30.620
I talk about this--

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:34.430
and I think this is where you,
VISTA folks, can really be an

00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:35.900
asset to nonprofits--

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:38.200
is I always here, we don't
know how to use Excel, we

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.680
don't have the skills.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:40.610
Why aren't you measuring?

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:42.370
Because we don't have
the skills in-house.

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:44.440
We don't know how to do it.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:48.380
So organizations need to improve
their data literacy.

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:50.720
Whether it means going out
to the many sources of

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:54.770
volunteers, maybe using that
LinkedIn board source tool and

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:57.690
finding a data scientist to come
into the organization to

00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:00.880
help them, coming to Google
and begging, stealing a

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.800
Googler to work with them.

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.930
Or you, who are working with
VISTA, helping the

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:08.180
organizations that you're
working with to help

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:11.690
organizations get comfortable
in some of the basics, and

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:15.060
maybe handle some of the more
advanced techniques for them.

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:20.744
So really, really focus
on data literacy.

00:23:20.744 --> 00:23:23.900
OK, then it's the picking
out the tools.

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:27.230
If I had a dollar for every
time I got asked questions

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:29.820
about measurement tools,
I'd be really rich.

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:32.260
I could retire, because it seems
like that's what people

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:33.320
are mostly interested in.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.960
They ask questions about the
tools, because it's easy for

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.490
us to talk about the tools.

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:39.260
It's a little bit hard for
us to have measurement

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:40.200
discipline.

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.180
But when we talk about the
tools, it's important to

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:45.130
remember that there's three
categories of tools, and

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:47.490
they're going to collect
different types of data.

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:50.290
And you're going to use
different tools to collect

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:51.940
different types of
data depending on

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:53.370
what your goals are.

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:56.220
So we have content analysis,
like the up story.

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:59.590
And that's looking at measuring
well how messaging

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:02.040
is doing, or sentiment.

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:05.820
If your goal is around behavior
change or preferences

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:08.100
or looking at attitudes, you're
going to be doing some

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:09.480
survey research.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:13.830
If your goal's around expanding
traffic, engagement,

00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:17.920
or taking some kind of action,
or making a donation, signing

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.170
up to volunteer, then you're
going to be looking at one of

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:21.170
the analytics tools.

00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:22.740
And I have to say, the
nonprofit sector

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:25.740
loves Google Analytics.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:28.340
They all would like t-shirts
that say, Google Analytics.

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:30.810
In fact, I personally have one,
although it didn't match

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:34.070
my outfit, or else I
would have worn it.

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:37.290
So the idea here is, don't think
about the tools first.

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:40.010
Think about what tools are going
to get you the data to

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:43.090
help you figure out whether you
have reached your goals or

00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:44.900
been successful.

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:49.220
And then, how do you know
who this guy is?

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:50.144
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:50.144 --> 00:24:51.070
BETH KANTER: No.

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:51.300
Who is he?

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:52.710
Who?

00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:53.180
OK.

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:55.105
And you know his famous line?

00:24:55.105 --> 00:24:57.120
You know the famous line
in "Crocodile Dundee"?

00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:59.070
AUDIENCE: That's not a knife.

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:00.930
BETH KANTER: The knife, OK.

00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:01.860
So he's in New York.

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:03.565
OK, he's in New York City, he's
getting off the subway.

00:25:03.565 --> 00:25:06.260
It's Crocodile Dundee.

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:08.530
and some punks come up, and they
want to hold him up, and

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:10.230
he says, you call
that a knife?

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:13.430
He said, that's a knife.

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:19.330
OK, so what I say in analysis
skills, that's a spreadsheet.

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:22.450
OK, so this spreadsheet comes
from Global Giving.

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:25.010
And so often, I see spreadsheets
from nonprofits,

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:27.100
and it's just data without
a framework.

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:32.010
And so they are gathering with
their knife, cutting data from

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:35.330
different sources, and looking
at it in context against their

00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:37.150
goals and their strategies.

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:38.915
So now that's a spreadsheet.

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.960
And actually, this is a
collection of spreadsheets

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:48.370
that I've been collecting from
nonprofits on a Tumblr blogs

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:50.850
called F Yes, Nonprofit
Spreadsheets.

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:53.610
OK, so if you really want to
look at other examples of

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:56.830
nonprofit measurement
spreadsheets, check it out on

00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:58.855
Tumblr, and you'll
find this one.

00:25:58.855 --> 00:26:02.630
All right, and finally, this
whole idea of reflection and

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:04.810
improvement.

00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:06.560
We're so busy in nonprofits--

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:09.080
check it off the to-do list,
let's get it done-- that we

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:12.300
don't hit the pause button and
reflect about, OK, what is the

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:13.520
data actually mean?

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.030
And how are we going to change
what we're doing

00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:17.620
to get better results?

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:22.890
And I love MomsRising, because
they have two organizational

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:24.280
processes that I just love.

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:27.860
And I love to see here when
organizations steal them.

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:30.840
The first is they do
Metrics Monday, OK?

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:33.920
So every Monday at their staff
meeting-- and they maybe have

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.660
a dozen staff members, if that--
they sit down, and they

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:39.560
have a section where they look
at their metrics against their

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:42.790
key performance indicators,
and discuss it.

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:45.910
And they may do deeper dives,
but every Monday, they're

00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:47.200
looking at their metrics.

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:50.990
And during these meetings, today
have institutionalized

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:54.150
the concept called the
joyful funeral.

00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:56.220
OK, because they know that
they're experimenting with

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:56.870
these new tools.

00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:58.630
Things don't always work.

00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:01.140
How many campaigns that you ran
were completely perfect

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.060
the first time you did it?

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:05.040
Of course, everybody, right?

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:08.680
But things don't go as well as
they should, and you tweak,

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.850
and you measure, and
you improve.

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:14.230
So here, if they find something
that's not working,

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:16.760
they said, we're going to
call a joyful funeral.

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:20.190
And what that is is they
actually have a formal funeral

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:23.410
for a particular technique or
tactic or something that just

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:24.380
didn't work.

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:26.840
OK, you know that Twitter
chat that was my idea?

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:29.890
And we got three people to
show up, and two tweets.

00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:31.370
That bombed.

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:33.710
Should we give it a
joyful funeral?

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:35.760
Yes, I'll call the flowers.

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.660
OK, it's time for a eulogy.

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:38.860
They actually give
it a eulogy.

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:40.740
And when they're talking about
the eulogy, they'll look at

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:43.610
their data, and then they'll
reflect about, is this time

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:45.380
for us to stop doing
this completely?

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:47.950
Or is there another test
or another experiment

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:49.430
that we can set up?

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:54.980
Because they know that to get
a big win, they have to fail

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:57.640
or have some things not
work, or even to

00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:59.130
have incremental wins.

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:00.550
So I think it's a
great technique.

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:06.320
So the practices are finding
the right metric--

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:09.270
that kicking butt metric--

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:13.440
data literacy in your
organization from within or

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:17.200
from without outside, finding
the right tool to get the

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:21.230
right data to know that you're
successful, making the time

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:22.730
for analysis--

00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:25.120
getting a now, that's
a spreadsheet--

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:28.340
and also making time for
reflection and continuous

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:29.820
improvement.

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:35.580
So I want to end with a story
now about the final lesson

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:39.420
about social media measurement
that I learned from my dad,

00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:41.370
and that I can share with
all of you, because I

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:44.380
think it's a real gift.

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:49.250
My dad was 91 when he passed,
and he was an OB/GYN doctor

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:51.400
for many years.

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:55.540
And when we were writing his
obituary, we figured that he

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:57.520
probably deliver
10,000 babies.

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:01.460
And he chose that profession
because he wanted a medical

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:04.770
specialty that had joy
and happiness in it.

00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:06.400
And what's more happy
they bringing a new

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:09.180
life into the world?

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:10.730
But he had other interests
besides work.

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:14.330
He was an early adopter
of technology.

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:17.630
He was the first person to get
an Apple computer back

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:19.650
whenever he had.

00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:22.510
He was an early adopter
of the internet.

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:26.080
He showed me how to
sign up for email.

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:28.820
He was an early adopter of
beeper technology, cameras.

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:30.630
He just loved technology.

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:35.420
But what he loved even more than
technology was the ocean.

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:38.660
He really cared deeply about
the ocean and ocean

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:42.160
conservation, but mostly,
also, surfing.

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.060
So are there any surfers
in the audience?

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:45.090
Any surfers?

00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:47.840
Well, if there were, they'd
recognize that the board he's

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:51.180
carrying is a Greg Noll board,
which is a classic.

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:52.190
It's a big board.

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:54.870
And that's actually me and
my brother in the ocean.

00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:59.480
So I wanted to find a way
to honor him, and

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:00.510
so I came up with--

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:03.780
I was going to do a social media
fundraising campaign to

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:06.620
raise money for Surfrider
Foundation for ocean

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:10.920
conservation, and also to do
an online memorial event.

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:16.130
Now when a surfer dies,
in real life,

00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:17.740
they do a paddle out.

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:19.350
And a paddle out is where
they all have

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:20.250
paddle out in the ocean.

00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:23.280
They get in a big circle
out in the ocean.

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:26.390
They hold hands, and they throw
flowers up in the air to

00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:28.830
remember the surfer
who passed.

00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:31.370
So I thought, given his love of
technology, I wanted to do

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:32.950
something virtually.

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:36.810
So I came up with an online
memorial where I get people to

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:40.110
tweak the hashtag oceanloveearl
during the

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:42.970
24-hour period, and
share stories of

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:44.400
their love of the ocean.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.080
And the goal is to get as many
people to honor my father in

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:51.180
this way, and also
raise some money.

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:54.740
So one of the things I want to
get nonprofits past is don't

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:56.510
just count, OK?

00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:59.360
Get beyond counting, OK?

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:00.990
Yes, you have to count
when you measure.

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:02.080
That's the first level.

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:05.220
So if I'm counting, I could
tell you all of this, all

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:07.290
these stats about the
campaign, and

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:08.210
pat myself on back.

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:10.070
Wow, I raised $5,500.

00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:15.680
I got 128 donors with 87%
donating more than the

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:18.240
suggested minimum gift level.

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:21.490
I converted 85% from Facebook.

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:25.940
72% were strong ties, and only
2% actually even knew my dad.

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:28.330
And I'm like, wow, wow, aren't
those great numbers.

00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:29.930
And that was about
the fundraiser.

00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:32.900
And I could tell you
the same sorts of

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:34.130
things about the event.

00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:36.770
That, wow, I had social reach
of over a million.

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:38.970
I got over 3,000 people
tweeting with the

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:40.990
hashtag, and so forth.

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:43.590
But get beyond the
numbers, OK?

00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:45.560
Use all those practices
and measurement.

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:47.250
And I did.

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:48.770
And I want to tell you a
little bit about what I

00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:50.220
learned about social

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:53.500
fundraising, and online events.

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:58.480
So the first thing is that you
have to set a goal, and you

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:01.480
have to do it based on
benchmarking, OK?

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:04.180
Now I have done personal
fundraising campaigns in the

00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:06.940
past for happier occasions,
like my birthday, and I've

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:08.935
been able to raise $5,000.

00:32:08.935 --> 00:32:11.780
So I thought, $5,000's
a good goal.

00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:15.320
But sometimes, we're afraid of
not making our goals, so we

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:16.370
put them way too low.

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:19.450
Or on the other hand, we are
totally unrealistic, and we're

00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:22.040
out of context, and we put them
way too high, and then we

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:25.100
beat ourselves up because we
failed, and we give up.

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:26.790
So benchmark.

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:29.350
Look at what others, or
look at your past.

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:32.360
And I did 10% more
than the goal.

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:34.330
The next thing is, don't
suffer from the too

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:36.330
small to fail, OK?

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:39.380
And I have done this in my
fundraising campaigns.

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:44.130
I would set my minimum gift
level as like $5 or $10,

00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:47.120
thinking, OK, my friends
aren't that rich.

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.200
I'll give them an easy in.

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:52.580
And people donate at the
suggested gift minimum.

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:54.890
And if it's too much,
they'll donate less.

00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:58.880
And I found that out, because
I did $25 as the

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:00.340
minimum gift level.

00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:01.200
And I got a little clever.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:04.120
I named each giving level
after a wave.

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:09.130
And I think the $100
was a cowabunga.

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:15.210
$25 was a pipeline wave, and
$250 were hurricane swirls.

00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:16.410
And I had, what was it?

00:33:16.410 --> 00:33:20.530
I had 128 donors, with 87%
donating at least the gift of

00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:22.390
minimum or above.

00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:26.910
So don't set your minimums too
low, and people will give

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:30.360
according to what
you asked for.

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:31.220
The next is--

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:34.215
see, my dad was the first
early selfie taker.

00:33:34.215 --> 00:33:35.960
He experimented with cameras.

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:39.070
So I have a whole collection of
selfies of me growing up.

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:43.370
See, it's not just a new thing
in the last couple of years.

00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:47.140
But what would happen is every
time I got a donation, I

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:50.410
thanked people publicly, and I
was using my Facebook profile.

00:33:50.410 --> 00:33:53.400
And every time I thanked
people for a donation--

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:55.980
and I did it very personally
with a personal picture, and a

00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:57.600
link back to the campaign--

00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:00.090
I got more donations, because
I compared the time that I

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:03.000
posted my thank you with the
time that I got the donation.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.740
And I found that 85% converted
from Facebook.

00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:09.929
But really, the lesson here is
about social proofing, and

00:34:09.929 --> 00:34:12.400
social proofing is modeling
the behavior that you want

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:14.130
other people to do.

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:16.790
In this case, it's, oh wow,
Beth's thanking all these

00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:19.084
people who are donating to
this campaign, and I'm a

00:34:19.084 --> 00:34:21.120
friend of Beth, and I've seen
what's been going on.

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:22.760
So yeah, I'm going
to donate, too.

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:26.360
So it's this whole concept
of social proofing.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:29.980
So the other thing that I had in
the campaign is that I had

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:33.550
a continuum of ways for
people to engage.

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:38.130
From the high ask, which was
write a check or put in your

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:41.730
credit card, give some advice
to the campaign, share our

00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:44.780
personal story about your love
of the ocean; to things that

00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:47.909
were at a lower level, about
just sharing the hashtag or

00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:48.830
retweeting.

00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:51.520
And it's really important to
have that continuum of

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:54.139
engagement, because people are
going to come in and out at

00:34:54.139 --> 00:34:55.540
different levels.

00:34:55.540 --> 00:35:00.090
And there's a great article
about that at the Stanford

00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:02.830
Innovation Review
about the donor

00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:04.810
journey, the donor vortex.

00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:09.730
And I applied that idea to this
campaign, and it works.

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:12.350
At the same time, you're
also supposed to have--

00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:15.050
think about influencers
in your campaign.

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:16.920
Now, you know what
an influencer is?

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:18.620
Someone who can influence other

00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:21.030
people to make a donation.

00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:24.430
So while I had different levels
of engagement, I also

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:27.410
targeted people who were
influential within their

00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:29.950
network so they could inspire
their networks.

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:37.830
And so, I had 11 different blog
posts or Facebook posts

00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:40.840
from influencers that
represented different segments

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:43.040
of my personal network.

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:45.960
So at the nonprofit tech
people, I had the

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.330
social media people.

00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:50.340
Because I was raising money for
Surfrider rider I had the

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:51.390
surfers behind me.

00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:54.570
And I was also running
an analysis--

00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:56.520
a social network map--

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:58.130
of all these different
networks.

00:35:58.130 --> 00:36:00.410
Now the big blue one, that
one's my network.

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:02.470
But there were also these other
networks where there

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:06.670
were other influencers that
could reach into getting more

00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:09.380
gifts that came in.

00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:13.410
So this was a way to getting
influencers, to leverage your

00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:18.290
network, and to think about
it in a networked way.

00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:20.750
Finally, I know a lot of us have
been experimenting with

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:22.160
promoted posts on Facebook.

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:24.930
I hear it a lot from
nonprofits.

00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:28.450
And what I decided to do, I
knew that if I spent money

00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:31.430
with the goal of trying to
convert those in the amount of

00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:34.270
time I had, and given the
campaign, it probably wouldn't

00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:35.270
work as well.

00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:38.290
But I had another goal of
getting people to tweet with

00:36:38.290 --> 00:36:39.300
the hashtag.

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:42.480
And at the same time, I also
knew that Mashable was writing

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:44.010
up the whole thing, was talking

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:45.880
about the hashtag event.

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:48.620
So I timed the promotion to kind
of accelerate what was

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:50.830
already out there.

00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:55.020
And you can see kind of the big
balloon of where when you

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:59.430
use a promotion like this,
it's sort of like adding

00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:01.160
gasoline to the fire.

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:04.820
So you can't expect promoted
posts to create the fire.

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:07.670
But if you have where you're
riding a wave, and you have a

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:10.275
lot of buzz around it, you can
give it that extra push.

00:37:10.275 --> 00:37:13.990
Because again, my goal was to
get as much awareness around

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:16.560
using the hashtag in the event,
and to get people

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:19.650
tweeting during that day.

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:23.635
And finally, this didn't come
from the numbers at all.

00:37:23.635 --> 00:37:26.240
This came from looking and
counting up, what were the

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:30.170
number of people that shared
their personal story about the

00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:32.150
love of the ocean, and what
were some of the creative

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:33.780
things that they did?

00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:38.920
And I had something around 37
instances of people sharing

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:42.680
the hashtag with their
story around

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:44.210
their love of the ocean.

00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:46.840
And what's great about this is
that if you've built your

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:50.000
network in the right way, it
unleashes the creativity.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.570
But I'm also thinking ahead,
and I'm thinking about,

00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:55.930
wouldn't this be a great thing
for me to do every year, to

00:37:55.930 --> 00:37:57.810
raise money for ocean
conservation,

00:37:57.810 --> 00:37:59.410
and to honor my dad?

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:02.510
And oh my god, I'm going
to need content.

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:05.990
And here, the network has
produced this great content,

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:08.170
so I'm not starting all
over from scratch.

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:12.090
And because I've captured it and
measured it, I have it at

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:15.770
hand when I start planning
my campaign.

00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:17.050
So all this to say--

00:38:17.050 --> 00:38:20.540
I guess my point with all of
these things is measurement is

00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:24.250
great, but go beyond the
numbers, go beyond counting.

00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:28.030
Use all those measurement
practices to really learn.

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:33.260
So in summary, these were, I
guess, my take-aways, and

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:38.250
hopefully yours, are having a
networked practice, having

00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:40.650
measurement discipline
happens incrementally

00:38:40.650 --> 00:38:41.840
one step at a time.

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:44.380
Don't try to have too much
change in your organization.

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:49.550
Also, linking social
media to outcomes

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:51.320
requires some silo busting.

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:55.440
And again, that happens
in small steps.

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:58.090
Data literacy--

00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:01.700
this is a real need in
the nonprofit sector.

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:04.610
And it's great that you're in
the room, and I have the great

00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:06.970
people in the room, because I
know lots of nonprofits who

00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:08.510
would love to snap you up.

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:11.520
I was talking to a couple of
math majors at lunch, and I

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:15.850
was secretly writing down your
names and your emails.

00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:19.500
And again, go beyond counting
your data, and really embrace

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:20.500
the learning from it.

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:24.365
So with that, I want to thank
you for letting me share--

00:39:24.365 --> 00:39:28.650
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:28.650 --> 00:39:30.747
and open it up for questions.

00:39:30.747 --> 00:39:33.490
AUDIENCE: That hashtag,
was it oceanloveearl?

00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:34.740
BETH KANTER: Yes.

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:37.830
oceanloveearl.

00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:39.210
I broke a rule of hashtags.

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:42.160
It was a little bit too long,
but I wanted ocean, love, and

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.560
earl in there, so.

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:44.728
AUDIENCE: Are all the tools
that you're using for

00:39:44.728 --> 00:39:48.346
tracking, are they online open
source, or are you using

00:39:48.346 --> 00:39:50.200
software, hardware?

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:57.030
BETH KANTER: OK, so in the
oceanloveearl example, I'd

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:59.980
like to eat my own dog food, and
I work with a lot of small

00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:02.934
and midsized nonprofits who
don't-- as you know, as you

00:40:02.934 --> 00:40:05.250
all know-- don't have a lot
of resources and time.

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:08.020
So I've tried to just use what
is available out there that's

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:09.280
low cost and free.

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:13.130
So yeah, I use Google Analytics,
Facebook Insights.

00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:16.990
I used a spreadsheet.

00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:20.130
Because of that, I
pulled Razoo was

00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:21.660
the fundraising platform.

00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:28.270
And I use RowFeeder which will
gather up tweets based on a

00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:30.920
hashtag, and throw
them in a Google

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:33.640
Spreadsheet for analysis.

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:40.660
So I use light, free tools, and
my brain, and my heart.

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:42.810
AUDIENCE: So for our group--
for the hands-on tech group

00:40:42.810 --> 00:40:45.755
that is working with all these
different nonprofits, a lot of

00:40:45.755 --> 00:40:49.220
the nonprofits that we work
with, there's always that

00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:50.950
question, which I'm sure you've
heard a million times

00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:54.690
is, how long should I spend
on my social media?

00:40:54.690 --> 00:41:00.460
And I know that's a tricky
question, but any advice?

00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:03.650
BETH KANTER: Well, first what's
behind the question?

00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:06.220
Because does it come out when
you're having a conversation

00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:08.740
about what you could do?

00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:14.830
Or is it coming out from the
typical scenario that I see a

00:41:14.830 --> 00:41:17.630
lot, and you probably see the
same, is that it's a small

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:20.590
organization, and it's probably
one person who does

00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:22.280
all the marketing
communications, and it's sort

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:26.080
of part of their job at making
time to do that.

00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:29.770
So what we try to look at
is, what are your goals?

00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:30.640
What is your strategy?

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:31.730
What are you trying to do?

00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:35.170
And does it fit with your
current capacity, OK?

00:41:35.170 --> 00:41:38.490
And can you downsize or
right-size your strategy to

00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:41.250
fit your current capacity, use
your measurement and best

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:43.530
practices, and get results?

00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:45.560
Now if you want to start to
scale your results, we're

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:49.100
going to have to look at how
can we invest more time or

00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:50.500
resources in this?

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:53.020
And so, usually that becomes a
conversation about, how can we

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:55.380
train and get other people
in the organization

00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:57.490
to use these resources?

00:41:57.490 --> 00:42:01.140
Or moving up to having
a halftime position,

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:05.010
quarter-time position, or
full-time position.

00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:07.260
And I can also say that there's
lots of ways and

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:08.640
techniques out there
to be efficient.

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:11.040
Like, I've gotten really good
with tweeting with one hand,

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:13.990
and drying my hair
with the other.

00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:17.120
And there are ways that you can
plan your day so you are

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:19.740
more efficient.

00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:20.700
Some people--

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:22.690
I hear a lot, oh, do I have to
be on Twitter all the time?

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:26.000
I said, well, no, you can use
it during found time while

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.090
you're waiting in line
to get your lunch.

00:42:28.090 --> 00:42:29.010
Send off tweets.

00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:30.010
There's scheduling tools.

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:31.630
There's lots of ways
to be efficient, so

00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:33.060
I'd also look at.

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:35.755
AUDIENCE: So the talk about
the targeting these

00:42:35.755 --> 00:42:41.870
nonprofits, you also talk
about some [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:46.400
So what's different between this
maybe-- or key difference

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:53.210
between the nonprofit versus
like a Google?

00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:54.040
BETH KANTER: A for-profit?

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:54.720
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:56.060
for-profit [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:56.060 --> 00:43:03.280
And also, how is people from
profit organizations be

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.361
successful and make
a contribution.

00:43:05.361 --> 00:43:09.250
How do they adapt to
the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:12.250
BETH KANTER: OK, so I think
I heard two questions.

00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:14.170
OK, so one was sort of the
difference between the

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:16.540
nonprofit and the for-profit
sector.

00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:18.910
And they're becoming
more blurred.

00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:22.600
And you might want to look up
the work of Lucy Burnholz, who

00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:27.040
is taking a specific look at
different formats and the

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:29.610
different legal formats, and
the ways that they work

00:43:29.610 --> 00:43:31.460
between nonprofit
and for-profit.

00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:33.650
And from a measurement
perspective and a social media

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:36.680
perspective, I think a lot of
nonprofits are more similar to

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:40.040
small businesses, because they
typically have less resources

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:42.070
than a large corporation like
Google that may have a

00:43:42.070 --> 00:43:43.730
department.

00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:47.240
I think larger nonprofits may
be similar to Google, and

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:48.990
there may be different
departments,

00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:50.240
there may be more silos.

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:52.960
And that may be as similarity.

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:56.920
I think the main difference is
that nonprofits are measuring

00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:00.400
things that, aside from some of
the financial outcomes like

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:03.640
donations or people signing up
to volunteer, they're trying

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:05.890
to measure things that are kind
of difficult, like social

00:44:05.890 --> 00:44:08.980
change, climate change,
saving the world.

00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:13.120
And that requires a whole other
set of skills than maybe

00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:18.130
measuring sales cycles
and product growth.

00:44:18.130 --> 00:44:21.630
So your second question, which
I think was about how could--

00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:22.950
I'm assuming you work
for Google?

00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:23.570
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:24.850
BETH KANTER: OK.

00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:28.360
That how can I, as, an
employee of a large

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:30.490
corporation like Google,
make a difference in

00:44:30.490 --> 00:44:31.810
the nonprofit sector?

00:44:31.810 --> 00:44:33.100
And I think most
corporations--

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:35.480
and correct me if I'm wrong--
probably you have a volunteer

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:38.660
program where you place, and
have volunteer opportunities.

00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:41.650
I would find that person in
department internally.

00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:43.130
It's right there, right?

00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:44.280
Talk to Seth.

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:47.630
And if you have measurement
skills or data skills, my god,

00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:49.480
could I have your card?

00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:53.750
I know 15 nonprofits within the
last week have said, we

00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:55.000
need a data person.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.820
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that's what
I've been working on.

00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:01.024
I'm an analyst for the emerging
markets, so that

00:45:01.024 --> 00:45:02.888
Cambodia [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:02.888 --> 00:45:05.900
We cover a lot [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:07.447
BETH KANTER: OK, well,
definitely talk to Seth.

00:45:11.110 --> 00:45:12.370
AUDIENCE: As a follow-up to
that, maybe you can talk a

00:45:12.370 --> 00:45:15.200
little bit about organizations
that are effectively using

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:17.730
volunteers to either help with
their social media, or help

00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:19.570
measure their social
media campaigns.

00:45:19.570 --> 00:45:20.080
BETH KANTER: Sure.

00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:21.360
The one that comes to mind--

00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:30.390
their name is the Analysis
Exchange.

00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:35.430
And they pair people who do
analytics in corporations with

00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:39.550
nonprofits, and actually a
student who is taking an

00:45:39.550 --> 00:45:40.500
analytics course.

00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:43.330
And they will sit and do a
project, and help them get set

00:45:43.330 --> 00:45:46.310
up, and teach them how to use
their analytics program.

00:45:46.310 --> 00:45:49.550
And while I was writing the
book actually, some of my

00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:52.330
testers actually worked with
several of them, and they said

00:45:52.330 --> 00:45:53.660
it was great.

00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:57.480
Since then, I've seen-- and I
wrote a blog post about this

00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:01.660
called "Help, My Nonprofit Needs
a Data Nerd." I've seen

00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:05.100
more and more organizations
that are doing volunteer

00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:06.470
skill-matching.

00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:09.170
And one of them is called
DataKind, where they actually

00:46:09.170 --> 00:46:11.980
place data scientists
with nonprofits.

00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:15.920
I think also, I know you had the
good folks from LinkedIn

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:18.680
yesterday talk to you, and they
probably talked about the

00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:21.150
profile categories.

00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:27.960
Going to LinkedIn, if you're
on LinkedIn, and I tell

00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:31.570
nonprofits to actually go to
LinkedIn and sign up for Board

00:46:31.570 --> 00:46:34.050
Source, and start searching on
those different skills that

00:46:34.050 --> 00:46:36.750
you need to recruit in-house.

00:46:36.750 --> 00:46:39.120
AUDIENCE: And just internally
for Google, the Googlers who

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:42.020
are here, you can go to go/give
to find more volunteer

00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:44.990
opportunities, including social
media and analytics

00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:47.465
[INAUDIBLE].

00:46:47.465 --> 00:46:48.460
AUDIENCE: Hi, Beth.

00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:49.680
My name is Ling-ling.

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:53.020
I'm a [INAUDIBLE] serving
in Pittsburgh this year.

00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:57.076
My question for you is that
not only is in nonprofit

00:46:57.076 --> 00:47:01.885
sector, it seems like the
priority is really applying

00:47:01.885 --> 00:47:06.340
for grants, so that the
nonprofit will have a budget

00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:08.310
to do the job.

00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:12.540
So we're talking the skill
budget instead of the skill

00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:13.770
[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:14.920
or their mission.

00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:22.510
And so, have you ever tried to
use social media to facilitate

00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:26.030
the grant application process?

00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:30.520
Or do you foresee that there
will be a trend for

00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:36.790
grant-makers to use that piece
as an environment for

00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:37.590
grant-making?

00:47:37.590 --> 00:47:41.600
Because really, I believe that
we should talk more about the

00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:46.000
scale of their dream instead of
the scale of their budget.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:46.260
BETH KANTER: Yeah.

00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:50.760
So you're talking about one of
my favorite topics is on the

00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:53.840
one side, we have the nonprofit
sector using social

00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:57.280
media to do maybe grant
research, OK?

00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:00.430
So if I was a nonprofit, and I
wanted to do that, I would

00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:03.330
definitely be looking and
listening and looking at the

00:48:03.330 --> 00:48:07.360
profiles of the foundations that
are using social media,

00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:10.490
and learning and connecting with
different staff members

00:48:10.490 --> 00:48:11.420
that are out there.

00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:14.890
And I would go to a place like
the Glass Pocket's blog, which

00:48:14.890 --> 00:48:17.810
is supposed to be about to
philanthropy and transparency.

00:48:17.810 --> 00:48:20.120
And there is a list
there if you go

00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:21.250
into one of the sections.

00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:23.190
You'll find this list, and
you'll see all the

00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:25.860
foundations, and you can
actually sort them by, I want

00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:28.340
to see all their Facebook pages,
all their blogs, all

00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:30.360
their Twitter profiles.

00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:32.320
And then as you start to dig
down into the Twitter

00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:34.670
profiles, you may start to find
other staff members that

00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:37.390
you can actually start to be
build that relationship.

00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:40.810
Now in terms of a nonprofit
using social media to generate

00:48:40.810 --> 00:48:42.940
funding, there is a story of--

00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:49.210
it was an organization in New
Jersey that did young people's

00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:51.260
entrepreneur programs.

00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:52.930
And it has a name, it's
going to come to me.

00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:55.420
It's a national organization,
and they have affiliates.

00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:58.130
And so, the development director
had started using

00:48:58.130 --> 00:49:01.090
Twitter, and she was saying
things like, sign up for our

00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:04.410
golf charity event, and she
was getting crickets.

00:49:04.410 --> 00:49:07.210
And then she said, OK, I'm going
to start figuring out

00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:08.470
who's following me.

00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:12.910
I'm going to start figuring out
who's interested in after

00:49:12.910 --> 00:49:16.340
school programs, and who's
talking about that on Twitter.

00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:19.820
And she found this person who
is the founder of a local

00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:21.120
family foundation.

00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:22.260
And she found them on Twitter.

00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:23.320
It was one of her followers.

00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:25.840
And she started talking
to her on Twitter.

00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:28.720
And then she got invited to
lunch, and then the funder

00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:34.120
actually made a grant of $35,000
to fund her program.

00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:37.430
I don't think that, right
now, is the norm.

00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:41.075
But it shows that there is
a possibility of this.

00:49:41.075 --> 00:49:42.340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:47.350
question, because your last
advice really struck me, said

00:49:47.350 --> 00:49:48.940
go beyond the [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:53.350
Really, if you don't have the
speech scheduled you, I really

00:49:53.350 --> 00:49:59.722
want to suggest to you to give
a talk to the grant-makers,

00:49:59.722 --> 00:50:02.460
because in the nonprofit
sector,

00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:04.600
everything is so connected.

00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:09.873
If the indication can come from
the money-giver side, it

00:50:09.873 --> 00:50:15.160
would be so much easier for
nonprofits to budget our money

00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:18.300
to invest into the social
media strategy.

00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:21.260
Then we'll get the return
on that investment.

00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:25.280
BETH KANTER: And I think funders
are coming a long way.

00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:28.530
A couple years ago, I was sort
of taking that mantle up.

00:50:28.530 --> 00:50:31.110
But if you take a look at, like
for example, the Case

00:50:31.110 --> 00:50:33.480
Foundation, the Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation.

00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:38.730
If you want to see an example
of the future, of a

00:50:38.730 --> 00:50:41.440
philanthropy organization
embracing social media and

00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:43.110
connecting, just take a
look at what Robert

00:50:43.110 --> 00:50:45.760
Wood Johnson is doing.

00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:49.170
And also, they did a great
convening in the field of the

00:50:49.170 --> 00:50:50.960
state of social media
measurement.

00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:52.810
They brought together and
started raising the dialogue

00:50:52.810 --> 00:50:54.030
around that.

00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:54.440
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:56.430
With that, we'll say thank
you to Beth Kanter.

00:50:56.430 --> 00:50:57.330
Really appreciate it.

00:50:57.330 --> 00:50:57.630
BETH KANTER: Right.

00:50:57.630 --> 00:50:58.230
Thank you, thank you.

00:50:58.230 --> 00:51:03.872
[APPLAUSE]
