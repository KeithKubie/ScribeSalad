00:00:01.565 --> 00:00:02.315
FUMI YAMAZAKI: OK.

00:00:02.315 --> 00:00:03.310
Hello everyone.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:04.920
Thank you for coming.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.340
I'm super excited
that we're having Joel

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.935
Gurin the author of this book
"Open Data Now" to Google.

00:00:12.935 --> 00:00:13.560
JOEL GURIN: OK.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.390
Thank you all so
much for coming.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.740
I want to say a couple of quick
things before we get started.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.940
You can see on this slide I have
a website as well as a book.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.640
The website is
also open data now,

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.010
just for the sake of simplicity.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.020
I use @joelgurin
for Twitter I also

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.200
use the hash tag #opendatanow.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.110
There is a pattern there.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.200
I'm very happy to be
speaking to you today.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.034
Also, if you didn't see it on
the way in, on the way out,

00:00:42.034 --> 00:00:43.450
there is a sign
up sheet if you're

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.140
interested in getting free
email updates from my website

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.555
or from the GovLab.

00:00:49.555 --> 00:00:51.180
Please sign up and
we'll keep in touch,

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.750
because there is a
lot to talk about.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:00.800
So why open data and how did I
get into this particular area?

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.019
I have to start by saying I am
probably by a couple of orders

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.890
of magnitude the least technical
person in this room right now.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.500
So what you're going
to hear from me--

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.290
and it is a little humbling,
to say the least, to come

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.350
to talk about data
to Google-- but what

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.390
I hope I can bring
to this is a sort

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.390
of sense of overall
perspective and context

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.770
from the work that I've done
in government and non-profits,

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.600
as a journalist and
now in academia.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.380
I really have tried to get
us a sense and sort of paint

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.630
a picture of how open data
is being seen and used

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.910
in society today that I hope
will be helpful to all of you.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.670
And I certainly hope we have
a little time for questions.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.290
So my background very
briefly-- as Fumi told you,

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.914
I began as a science journalist.

00:01:46.914 --> 00:01:48.330
I was editorial
director, and then

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.380
executive vice president
of "Consumer Reports" when

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.330
we launched
consumerreports.org, which

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.800
is the largest paid information
subscription site on the web

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.120
now with about 3 million
active paid subscribers.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.610
Shortly after that, I went
to the Federal Communications

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.500
Commission, began as head
of the Consumer Bureau.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.760
And at that point our
chairman, Julius Genachowski,

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.070
was very interested
in figuring out

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.470
how we can give consumers
help in a simple decision

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.120
like choosing a cellphone plan.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.080
Well choosing a
cellphone plan ends up

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.390
being kind of like solving some
difficult problem in topology

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.490
or some such thing
or at least in

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.350
statistics, because there are
about 1,000 different cellphone

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.270
plans offered by a
company like Verizon.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.260
You multiply that by
the number of companies,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.750
you factor in the fact
that every consumer has

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.886
different needs, so it became
pretty clear as I was looking

00:02:45.886 --> 00:02:48.260
at this and this is a problem
is more complicated than it

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.580
looks at first.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.630
It also turns out to be
very similar to problems

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.390
that other government
agencies face

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.280
in trying to advise
consumers on things

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.650
like financial services,
housing, mortgages, education,

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.100
and so on.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.640
So I began talking to
people in other agencies

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.690
about consumer
information, generally.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.580
Out of that I was invited to
chair the White House Task

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.420
Force on Smart Disclosure.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.060
Smart disclosure being
the term that we developed

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.950
to describe giving
data to consumers

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.220
that they can use to
make complex decisions.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.970
That report came out last May.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.300
And from that work I
became more involved

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.960
in open data and open
government more generally.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.030
I met Beth Noveck,
who some of you

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.830
may know as the head of the
Open Government Initiative

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.480
during President Obama's
first term and a real pioneer

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.320
and open government
and open data.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.760
She has now invited me to
come work at the GovLab

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.281
that she founded at NYU.

00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:44.030
And I'll tell you a
few things about that.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.920
And I also have this website
and this book on open data

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.810
now, so I am sort of
running the open data

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.130
practice for the
GovLab and looking

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.190
at the implications of
open data in many ways.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.500
Just a couple words
about the GovLab.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.450
I won't read what you
can see on the screen,

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.800
but our basic hypothesis
and our mission

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.580
is to figure out how to use
technology and collaborative

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.780
platforms and
basically 21st century

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.930
approaches to help improve
governance and government,

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.285
and the way that citizens
and government interact.

00:04:17.285 --> 00:04:19.660
We think that people should
interact with government more

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.709
than when they vote
once a year or when

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.180
they happen to make a comment on
We the People petition website

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.290
or something like that.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.020
We're looking at ways
to really develop

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.680
a different level
of engagement that

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.580
is good both for citizens
and for government as well.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.300
And this model of
collaborative democracy we feel

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.970
has three major
modes of operation-

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.150
the first one is
sharing responsibility,

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.890
where a government can
take a piece of what

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.580
has been a government
responsibility

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.580
and delegate that to citizens.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.210
And here the paradigm is
participatory budgeting,

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.150
where in 1,500 cities
around the world now

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.140
the city government is saying,
you take a chunk of the budget

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.400
and spend it as you wish.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.520
We think that can be done in
many other kinds of governance

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.670
situations and that
would be very productive.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:12.550
The second modality is getting
knowledge and expertise in.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.620
Figuring out ways that not
just the traditional government

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.480
advisers, but people
with technical abilities,

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.930
technical skills, insight into
community issues, and so on,

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.350
can advise government at the
federal, state, and city level

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.100
and we're seeing a lot
of models for that.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.160
And then the third modality
is getting open data out,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.730
which is what I work on and what
I'm going to talk about today.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.270
So what is open data?

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.370
There are a number
of good definitions

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.486
that have been done
by different groups

00:05:40.486 --> 00:05:42.610
like the Open Knowledge
Foundation and the Sunlight

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:43.700
Foundation.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.030
What I did in
writing this book was

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.130
to choose a fairly
general definition-

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.450
that open data is accessible
public data that people,

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:57.090
companies, and organizations
can use to launch new ventures,

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.900
analyze patterns and trends,
make data-driven decisions,

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.780
and solve complex problems.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.620
This definition
incorporates not only

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.510
open data from government, which
is where a lot of the focus

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.030
has been, but also open data
from sources like social media.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.740
For many sources that
are accessible to you

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.930
at Google, and from other
kinds of data that companies

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.130
themselves may choose to
release in different ways, as

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:24.490
well scientific data.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.640
So what you're going to
hear me talk about today

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.110
is open data in
all of those forms

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:30.620
and how they relate
to each other,

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.060
and how they relate to
social and business goals.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.370
I do think-- and I'm
certainly convinced having now

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.580
worked in this area
for a couple of years--

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.910
that we're talking
about a phenomenon that

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.990
has tremendous implications
and tremendous impact

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.000
potentially not only
for business, but also

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.810
for as for scientists,
for journalists,

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:53.620
for consumers, and
for government.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.050
And in many ways,
we're starting to see

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.980
a convergence of the civic
and the commercial uses

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:03.410
of open data, where we're
seeing some ventures that

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.180
may start as non-profits that
turn out to have a sustainable

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:06.942
business model.

00:07:06.942 --> 00:07:08.650
And we're seeing
businesses that turn out

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:10.800
to be actually
extremely mission driven

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.450
in their use of open data.

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:15.120
And you'll see many
examples today.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.750
What is open data not?

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:19.674
Open data is not the
same as big data.

00:07:19.674 --> 00:07:21.340
And it's not the same
as open government

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:22.930
and it's not even
really a blending

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:24.370
of big data and open government.

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.010
It's a different kind animal.

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:29.560
Big data also has
many definitions.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.030
I think the only thing everybody
agrees on, at least when

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:33.655
I ask them, is that
when you're talking

00:07:33.655 --> 00:07:36.610
about what you mean by big data,
we mean like really, really

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:37.590
a lot of data.

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:41.420
Really big data sets, which
is not too surprising.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:45.700
I think you can more accurately
say that big data involves

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.770
data sets that are at the
current limit of our ability

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:51.030
to analyze and use,
but, of course, that

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.090
limit changes every day.

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:57.100
I do think there are real ways
in which the quantity of data

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.030
has a qualitative impact.

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:02.040
In the same way that when
I came here from New York,

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.160
I theoretically could
have ridden a bicycle,

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.890
or even walked,
and taking a plane

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:11.120
is really more than an
accelerated way of doing that,

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.829
it's a whole different
kind of travel.

00:08:12.829 --> 00:08:15.120
So I think that big data does
have that kind of impact.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:20.410
But it's not philosophically
different in my view anyway

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:22.530
from smaller data
problems in the way

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:25.670
that open data is
philosophically its own thing.

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:28.120
Open government is
very closely related

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.500
to the concept of open
data, but it's broader.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.340
Open government
includes all kinds

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.059
of government transparency.

00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:37.990
It also includes the kinds
of collaboration and things

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:40.429
that I just showed on
the GovLab's slide.

00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:42.280
So part of it is data
related but part of it

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.180
is really other kinds
of citizen engagement.

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:49.290
So the book does present
the grand unified theory

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:53.350
of what is open data in
a simple Venn diagram

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:55.730
that you will find in
appendix A in the book,

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:58.090
and you can also
find on my website

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:01.690
opendatanow.com in a
fairly lengthy blog post.

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:03.970
I won't go through all
this to analyze it,

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:06.080
but the most important
thing to notice

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:10.590
here is that big data, open
data, and open government

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.190
have several points and
areas of intersection.

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:14.970
They are distinct,
but they overlap.

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.710
And when they overlap, it
gets really interesting.

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:21.110
The point in the middle,
sector six there,

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:22.940
which is all three
things-- these

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:26.530
are large public government
data sets like weather, GPS,

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:28.584
Securities and Exchange
Commission data center.

00:09:28.584 --> 00:09:30.750
This is where we're going
to see some of the highest

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:34.850
economic value and some of the
highest potential civic value.

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:38.240
But it is by no means
the only thing that's

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:42.130
important about open data,
or the only kind of open data

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:43.800
that's important.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.390
So that's the terrain.

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:49.680
Having said that, I'm going
to take you very quickly,

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:54.780
believe it or not, through what
I see as nine open data trends.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:58.810
I'm going to pose
three open open data

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:01.320
questions that I don't
have the answers to,

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.900
but I think we can all probably
discuss and think about.

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.070
And I'm going to describe
a study that we're now

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:10.660
doing at the GovLab that I think
will be of interest you called

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:13.900
the Open Data 500, that I think
is going to really help advance

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.040
this field.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.600
So let's get started.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.100
So the first trend is
liberating government data.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:24.120
It's undeniable that
governments at all levels

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.740
not only in the US,
but in countries

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:29.010
around the world are now
focusing on ways that they can

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:31.860
take data that they
control and make

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.090
it available to the
public as open data.

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:37.890
And in the US, we've seen
a major step forward.

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:41.780
Most recently last May,
when President Obama

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:44.160
announced the new
Open Data Policy.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.186
This policy has been
called the biggest change

00:10:48.186 --> 00:10:49.810
in how we deal with
federal information

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:53.180
since the Freedom of
Information Act the 1960s.

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.180
It's potentially that big.

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.580
There are a lot of questions
about how we implement it,

00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:58.940
which I'll talk about.

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:01.940
But it is a very
ambitious and I think

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:05.360
a very right-thinking
kind of program

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.730
to make government
data open by default.

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:10.300
Meaning that unless there's
a security reason or privacy

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.360
reason or something like that
to keep it hidden, it's open

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.596
and anybody ought to use it.

00:11:14.596 --> 00:11:16.220
Now one thing that's
really significant

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:19.050
is that when the president
announced this policy,

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:20.750
he used these words,
which you could see

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:24.640
are very business focused and
he actually chose a technology

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.780
center in Austin Texas to do it.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:30.730
So the administration is
really positioning open data

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:33.270
as a job creator and
as a business driver.

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:36.080
That's partly why
we at the GovLab

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.030
are studying it
through that lens,

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:40.910
because we want to see to
what extent that is really

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:42.360
a defensible proposition.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.070
I think it is, but I think
it's still a work in progress.

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:48.090
So the whole question
of why should government

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:50.360
go to the trouble
and the expense,

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:54.130
and the time of making data
open, part of the answer people

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.590
think, is that it's going
to have an economic benefit

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:58.410
as well as being a social good.

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:01.590
This Open Data Policy, which
was announced last May,

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:05.170
talks about presumption of
openness or open by default

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:08.430
making data machine
readable, reusable timely.

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:11.670
This was based in many ways
on the definitions of the Open

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:13.680
Knowledge Foundation and
the Sunlight Foundation

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.140
developed several years ago.

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:16.700
One really
interesting difference

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:20.010
is that those definitions said
and the data has got to be free

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:22.610
and the government definition
doesn't quite say that.

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:25.386
So there's still some room for
agencies to charge for data,

00:12:25.386 --> 00:12:26.760
but I think the
direction is very

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.980
much towards free open data.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.560
In addition to
this policy, there

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.880
is now something called
the DATA Act, which

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.550
may be the only thing
in the known universe

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:41.700
that Ralph Nader and Grover
Norquist actually agree on.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.590
It is it's an extremely
bipartisan movement

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:47.000
it stands for Digital
Accountability and Transparency

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:47.610
act.

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:49.034
This is another
part of open data.

00:12:49.034 --> 00:12:51.200
So one part of open data,
like the Open Data Policy,

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.760
is let's release data we have
on weather, satellite data,

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:58.580
GPS, health data, et cetera--
data that government collects

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:00.060
that is useful to the public.

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.180
This is data that
government has about itself.

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:05.230
The goal of the DATA Act is
to make government spending

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:07.510
data more thorough,
more transparent,

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:10.170
more usable than it's
ever been by a lot.

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:12.291
To be able to make it
go all the way down,

00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:14.040
not just to the
contractors to government,

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.980
but subcontractors,
sub-subcontractors,

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:18.900
and to do it in a way
that is really accurate.

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:21.530
There is a website
called usaspending.gov.

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:22.980
It was intended to do this.

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:25.100
The Sunlight Foundation
recently calculated

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:29.260
that it is inaccurate to the
tune of $1.55 trillion a year.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:30.580
Otherwise, it's perfect.

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:34.781
So the DATA Act would automate
this in a way that would really

00:13:34.781 --> 00:13:36.280
solve that kind of
problem and there

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.820
is a lot of push now in Congress
to pass the DATA Act, which

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:41.990
I think would be another
major step forward.

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:43.780
So this is just at
the federal level,

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:46.600
but you're seeing similar
kinds of activity in cities,

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.000
in states, in the
60 countries that

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.024
now belong to the Open
Government Partnership.

00:13:51.024 --> 00:13:53.190
All of which are making
similar kinds of commitments

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:56.940
to open data for both civic
and job-creating reasons.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.240
That's one trend.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.170
The next trend, which
comes right out of that,

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:03.140
is that we are actually
seeing open data begin

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:05.290
to drive business growth
in a number of ways.

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:08.080
And you can find examples
all over the place- health,

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.040
education, transportation.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.400
My book has a
number of examples.

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.190
Somebody tweeted
recently, there's

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:17.140
so many apps and
businesses in here.

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:18.140
I can't even count them.

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:19.473
So I figured I would count them.

00:14:19.473 --> 00:14:22.530
There are to the best of
my knowledge, 183 of them.

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:24.040
So, happy reading.

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:26.600
You will find companies
in all of these sectors

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.170
and they're doing some
very creative things

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:32.100
with open data that are
showing that you don't have

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.460
to own the data in
a proprietary way

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:36.160
to make a thriving
business out of it.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.890
I'll just show you a
couple of examples.

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:41.390
So the Climate Corporation
based here in San Francisco

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:44.530
has become in many ways
sort of the poster child

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:48.970
for the commercial
use of open data.

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:50.720
I like to say I sort
of knew them when.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.630
They've gotten a fair amount
of publicity over the years.

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:56.670
I was fortunate to have a long
interview with their CEO David

00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:58.042
Friedburg last April.

00:14:58.042 --> 00:14:58.750
It's in the book.

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:02.207
And there's actually a longer
podcast with him on my website.

00:15:02.207 --> 00:15:04.040
And if you're really
interested in the stuff

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.998
I would encourage you to
check out the podcast,

00:15:05.998 --> 00:15:09.500
because it's a
fascinating story.

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.240
And the punch line
is they were recently

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.510
bought by Monsanto
for a billion dollars.

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:16.260
They've been profiled
in "The New Yorker,"

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.780
so they've emerged as
everyone's favorite example,

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:22.450
and I think rightly so, of
what this kind of data can do.

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:23.970
Their story is fascinating.

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:26.560
They began by saying
that they wanted

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.060
to sell better
weather insurance.

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.860
And they quickly focused
on farming and farmers

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.150
as their target.

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:34.760
They figured that if they
could get all this data

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.480
from the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration,

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.560
from NASA weather
data, et cetera,

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:43.740
and they applied really
extremely smart analytics.

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:47.289
And the guy who started it
just hired brilliant people.

00:15:47.289 --> 00:15:49.080
I think he actually
used to work at Google.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.510
And I'm sure he hired
some people from here.

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:54.210
But what they
figured they could do

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:56.770
was do risk calculations
that would enable them

00:15:56.770 --> 00:16:00.360
to use to calculate the risk
that they bore as an insurer

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.522
more accurately, so that
they could both help farmers

00:16:03.522 --> 00:16:04.980
and also make a
business out of it.

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:06.750
Well what happened
as they got into this

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:10.400
is that they found that
there were open data

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:13.220
sources that they could
use that were much better

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:15.860
and that would give them a much
better result than the commonly

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:16.820
used sources.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:18.669
So the first
iteration of this is,

00:16:18.669 --> 00:16:20.210
let's use data from
weather stations.

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:21.880
Well if you're a
farmer, even if you

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.620
look at every weather
station the US,

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:26.780
it might be 30 miles
away from your farm

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:28.110
and it's not helpful to you.

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:30.540
So long story
short, they ended up

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:34.950
getting data so that they could
look at a piece of farmland

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:38.230
roughly the size of this
mid-sized auditorium or even

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:38.980
smaller.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:41.680
They can calculate rainfall
to one hundredth of an inch.

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.630
They can look at
soil quality in a way

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:46.470
that they know exactly
how the soil is going

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:48.370
to respond to that
amount of rain.

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:51.770
And they're doing all of
this with almost all of it

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:53.830
with a couple of
small exceptions

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:58.250
is public open data that
anybody any one of us

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:00.030
theoretically could
access, but we

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:01.660
wouldn't know what
to do with it.

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:04.589
And knowing what to do with it
and knowing how to analyze it,

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:07.089
and bringing together both data
analysts, and subject matter

00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:10.530
experts, to create
this new kind of tool

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:13.660
is how they have created a
billion dollars worth of value.

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:16.099
They also believe
that they can now

00:17:16.099 --> 00:17:20.530
increase profitability for
farmers worldwide by 20% to 30%

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:24.318
and help farmers understand
how to deal with climate change

00:17:24.318 --> 00:17:26.859
by changing the crops they grow
and the seasons in which they

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:27.510
grow them.

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:28.800
So this is huge.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.880
This goes from we're
insurance salesmen to we're

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.620
leading the next
Green Revolution.

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:36.010
It's a direct application
of free open data

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:38.140
and it's a stunning
demonstration

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:41.130
of how even data that
is free and public

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:44.596
can be an incredibly
important business driver.

00:17:44.596 --> 00:17:45.970
A lot of people
think health care

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:47.370
will be the next big frontier.

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:50.160
This is a picture Todd Park,
who was the Chief Technology

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.080
Officer for Health
and Human Services

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.640
and for the last
couple years has

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.900
been CTO for the United States.

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.430
He runs this event in
Washington every year

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:00.250
called The Health Datapalooza.

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:01.950
Datapalooza, as
somebody pointed out,

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:05.174
could be literally defined as
an all out crazy party of data

00:18:05.174 --> 00:18:07.090
and that is pretty much
what these things are.

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:08.990
They get about
2,000 people a year.

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:10.990
And we are seeing
a lot of activity

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:13.600
in the health care center.
iTriage is an example that

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:18.310
uses the public registry
of health care providers.

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:20.660
So that if you're traveling
and you have some symptoms,

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:22.920
it can immediately tell you
for those symptoms are serious.

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.378
And if they are,
it'll tell you how

00:18:24.378 --> 00:18:25.930
to get to the nearest
emergency room

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:29.470
very quickly, even if
you're in a strange city.

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:33.150
In finance we're seeing a lot
of companies like this one.

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:36.350
This is CapitalCube, which is
now owned by Analytics Insight.

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:43.790
There are about 40,000
publicly traded companies

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:46.540
in the world for which
there is enough information

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:48.500
to say anything
intelligent about them.

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.720
These guys figured
out algorithms

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.620
to analyze all 40,000 of
them update their information

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:56.470
every single day, put their
results into a prose form

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:58.960
that any investor can
read, provide graphs

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:02.080
that show the relative risk
and the expected return

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:05.030
for a given company compared
to its competitors, et cetera.

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:08.230
Again this is not actually
necessarily using a new data

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:08.730
source.

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:11.290
They're using SEC data that's
been available for a while,

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:14.360
but they're applying a level of
analytics that probably was not

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.840
possible before fairly recently.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.420
This is becoming
and we're seeing

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.870
a lot of businesses in
the financial sector.

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:23.030
There's stuff
happening in energy.

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:26.220
Opower is a company that's
now working with utilities.

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:30.880
It will give you back not only
your own energy usage data,

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:34.570
but an aggregate summary of your
neighbors energy usage data,

00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:37.190
which is apparently the
most powerful motivator

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:41.430
to clean up your own act is
the fact that you got to do

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:42.540
as well as your neighbors.

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:44.123
They're using this
together with a lot

00:19:44.123 --> 00:19:47.840
of open data about energy
and energy usage and energy

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.970
efficiency to help
people save energy

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:53.140
and ultimately, hopefully
help fight climate change.

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:56.160
So there's many, many
examples but those just

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:59.650
give you a sense
of how this goes.

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:03.520
Now the interesting thing
in a segue from Opower

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.860
what they are
ultimately about is

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:08.590
helping consumers choose how
they're going to use energy.

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:11.704
So this gets back to what I told
you was the problem that got me

00:20:11.704 --> 00:20:13.370
into this whole area
of the first place-

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:15.110
how do you choose
a cellphone plan?

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:20.150
Well this whole area of smart
disclosure is about open data.

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:22.450
It's almost like a sort
of subset of open data.

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:24.450
It's about figuring out
how to get data that's

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:27.130
going to be useful to average
people to improve their lives

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:28.725
and put it out there
in a usable form.

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:34.900
Who here has read "Nudge"
by Cass Sunstein and Richard

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.290
Thaler?

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:38.140
It's a great book
if you're at all

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:39.780
interested in
behavioral economics.

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:42.310
It's a perfect read and
it's also interesting,

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:45.800
because it inspired
a ton of work

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.500
in the Obama administration.

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:51.150
So it's very much
about how understanding

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:53.390
collective behavior
in psychology

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:55.050
can help you make
policy decisions.

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:58.900
It was actually tested during
the first Obama campaign.

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:03.220
One simple example is they
found that if they planted-- not

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.980
planted, that's too strong a
word-- if they promoted news

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:09.312
stories before every
state primary election

00:21:09.312 --> 00:21:11.270
that there was going to
be huge voter turn out,

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:13.040
there would in fact
be huge voter turnout,

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.420
because nobody
wants to be left out

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:16.253
when there's going to
be huge voter turnout.

00:21:16.253 --> 00:21:18.740
So it became a kind of
self-fulfilling prophecy,

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:20.210
because they knew
that more voter

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:22.040
turnout would be
helpful to them.

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.200
Actually that may have been
in the election itself,

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.110
not the primaries--
correcting myself.

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:28.490
So anyway Cass Sunstein,
who was the regulatory czar

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:31.510
for the Obama administration,
is a big thinker in this area.

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:33.080
Richard Thaler,
who's an economist

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:35.630
at the University of
Chicago, is as well.

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:40.350
Their book "Nudge" was about how
you can create behavioral cues

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:44.390
and use information in ways that
nudge people to make choices

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:45.770
that are better for them.

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:50.930
Well, so here's an example- so
while Cass was regulatory czar,

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:55.350
one of the things that they
did is they reformed the label

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:57.590
that you see on cars
around energy efficiency.

00:21:57.590 --> 00:22:00.640
And you can see very clearly
the most obvious change here.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.450
So they go from the small type
saying, estimated fuel cost

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:09.040
2000 something a year to you
save $1,850 in fuel costs

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.170
over five years.

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:13.360
So it's a very simple example
but a pretty compelling one

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:16.630
of how the way you present
information affects what people

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:18.570
get from it and how
they make decisions.

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:23.080
OK that was very much the basis
of the Smart Disclosure Task

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:23.580
Force.

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:25.820
And what we set out to
do was to say, how do we

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:30.470
use these kinds of principles
at a time when most people are

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:34.187
getting information either on
their smartphones or on the web

00:22:34.187 --> 00:22:36.770
and where we're really trying
to figure out how to give people

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:39.260
information that is
personalized to them?

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:40.780
So think about how Kayak works.

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:43.360
I mean this is a pretty
amazing tool that

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:47.010
allows you to go online and
choose the flight that you want

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:50.480
to take tomorrow to wherever
you want to go out of literally

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:53.200
thousands of flights and you
can do in about 10 minutes.

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.800
So the question
we start to ask is

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.100
what if there was a
Kayak for everything?

00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:58.534
What would that look like?

00:22:58.534 --> 00:22:59.950
There was a lot
of work now to try

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:02.375
to figure out, how do you do
this for financial services?

00:23:02.375 --> 00:23:04.250
How do you do this for
health care insurance?

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:06.333
How do you do it for
mortgages, credit cards-- all

00:23:06.333 --> 00:23:08.640
these decisions that
frankly drive most of us

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:11.365
completely nuts every day,
either that or you just sort

00:23:11.365 --> 00:23:14.700
of pick one and
hope you're right.

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:18.060
Going back to cell phones
as the paradigm here,

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:21.650
it's been calculated that
Americans lose something

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:24.460
like $13 billion a
year collectively,

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:27.460
because we're not using most
efficient cellphone plans.

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:30.660
So this is real money and
in many cases of like health

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:33.790
insurance it's also safety,
and quality of care,

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:35.070
and quality of service.

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:37.850
So there have been a couple of
successful experiments here.

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:41.660
One of the ones I like a lot is
a site called greatschools.org.

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:42.650
This is a nonprofit.

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:44.030
They use state data.

00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:47.870
They use state data to analyze
the quality of public schools

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:49.530
and help people
make those choices.

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:52.510
This thing is now
used by more than 40%

00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:55.520
of all K through 12
households in the US,

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:58.900
which is just kind of fantastic
and shows you how much hunger

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:00.830
there is for this
kind of information.

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:04.300
Another success-- this one
is from the UK-- I always

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:06.970
like this because it's just
sort of so bizarre so this

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:10.590
is a site called
comparethemarket.com One night,

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:13.456
probably after a
couple of vodkas,

00:24:13.456 --> 00:24:15.080
somebody must have
been kidding around.

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:16.770
They were trying
on Russian accents

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:20.351
and somebody said it's
like, comparethemeerkat.com.

00:24:20.351 --> 00:24:22.540
Somebody then said, that
is a brilliant idea.

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:25.340
They decided that there are
a symbol should be a meerkat.

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:27.210
And there is now
the spokes-meerkat

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:29.390
in the UK called
Alexander Orlov, who

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:32.210
is the spokes-thing for
comparethemarket.com.

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:36.110
This thing became so
popular that Harrods

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:38.960
was going to-- yes,
you can collect

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.420
all six exclusive meerkat toys.

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:44.530
This is like a car
insurance shopping site.

00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:48.140
This is like as
if the Geico gecko

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:49.694
was sextuplets or something.

00:24:49.694 --> 00:24:50.860
I don't know what it's like.

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:53.110
But this thing became
so popular that they

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:55.790
were going to sell these one
year one Christmas at Harrods

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:57.330
and the CEO apparent
said we can't

00:24:57.330 --> 00:24:58.750
do that there's going to
be a run on the store.

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:00.625
We're just going to give
them all to charity.

00:25:00.625 --> 00:25:03.040
It has also made them a
very successful company.

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:06.990
Now what this shows-- beyond
the fact that people like fuzzy

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:09.430
stuffed animals
and that marketers

00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:13.130
have bizarre, but successful
ideas-- what this shows

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:16.187
it is also possible to build
a successful business doing

00:25:16.187 --> 00:25:18.270
comparisons of car insurance,
home insurance, life

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:20.880
insurance, energy, credit cards,
travel insurance, et cetera.

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:23.910
Nobody has yet made this model
really successful in the US,

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:25.384
but it is a huge consumer need.

00:25:25.384 --> 00:25:27.050
And I think one of
the things that we're

00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:29.780
going to see in the years
ahead is that smart disclosure

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.738
people are going to figure
out how to really do

00:25:31.738 --> 00:25:34.330
smart disclosure the right way
and it'll be both the consumer

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:37.700
service and a successful
business model.

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:39.660
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:42.020
JOEL GURIN: Why hasn't
it made it in the US?

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:44.310
I think there is a
couple of reasons.

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:46.880
I think one is that
people haven't quite

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:49.130
found the right
business model yet

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:53.720
that will do it in an honest
way and yet also be successful.

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:56.110
A lot of this works
off of lead generation.

00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:59.420
Lead generation gives
you the incentive

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:02.230
to game the system,
which is unfortunate.

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:03.980
So that's been a
bit of a problem.

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:08.335
I think also-- I don't actually
really have a good explanation.

00:26:08.335 --> 00:26:11.350
I think for some reason this
started culturally in the UK

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:13.210
with smaller companies
about 10 years ago

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:15.000
and it hasn't
doesn't seem to have

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.650
caught on here in the same way.

00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:18.420
And there are a lot
of inherent challenges

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:21.430
in trying to do comparisons for
10 different things at once.

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:23.190
Like the fact the
people generally

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:26.190
shop for any one of those only
once every couple of years.

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:29.632
But one way or another,
I think it's still

00:26:29.632 --> 00:26:31.340
a model that ought to
be applicable here,

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:33.850
because this is actually
one and only one

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:36.280
of several sites in the UK
that have been operating

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:37.500
successfully.

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.660
Anyway somebody should
figure this out.

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:43.860
I think it's an
interesting challenge.

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:49.140
Next trend- we're seeing
a lot of use of open data

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:53.320
in an investment context, which
I think can be good for society

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:54.148
as well.

00:26:54.148 --> 00:26:55.606
This is a British
company-- there's

00:26:55.606 --> 00:26:57.650
a lot of work going
on in London-- that

00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:03.980
is making open data available
about small to medium size

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:04.740
enterprises.

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:08.147
Private companies that have had
trouble attracting investment

00:27:08.147 --> 00:27:09.730
because the investors
don't want to go

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:12.190
to all the trouble of
analyzing whether or not

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:13.580
they're a good risk.

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:15.960
These guys are providing
enough information

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:18.820
that they believe they
can get about $250 billion

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:21.160
more dollars invested
in these companies

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:24.870
by simply providing the
information that lets investors

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:26.430
invest with confidence.

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:28.030
So that's a good
thing for business.

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:30.550
But a lot of the
potential I think

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:33.449
is in what used to be called
corporate responsibility--

00:27:33.449 --> 00:27:35.740
what's now being called
environmental social governance

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:39.000
measures, because we're seeing
more and more investors who

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.670
consider good sustainable
practices to be

00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:44.330
a sign of good
corporate governance.

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:47.180
So for example, the
Carbon Disclosure Project

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:49.770
collects data on
carbon footprint

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:53.040
from most of the major
companies from Fortune

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:54.560
500 and other companies.

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:57.400
They represent
institutional investors

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:00.900
who collectively have about
$87 trillion to invest.

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:04.530
So we're seeing some real
interest from that community.

00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:06.890
We're seeing the same kind
of thing being applied

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:08.360
to the consumer
field, particularly

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:12.050
by a company in San Francisco
called GoodGuide, which

00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:14.360
it provides a lot of
information to consumers

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:17.640
about the environmental impact
of the products and services

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:18.140
they buy.

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:20.442
Much of this based on
EPA and other open data.

00:28:20.442 --> 00:28:22.900
Companies are now becoming more
and more interested in this

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:24.441
because they want
to see if they have

00:28:24.441 --> 00:28:26.680
a good profile the
consumers will like.

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:29.770
And then finally, the Securities
and Exchange Commission

00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:33.790
has begun to demand that
companies that report to them

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:37.170
include information on
things like whether or not

00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:39.850
they use conflict minerals,
which are minerals that

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:42.770
are mined under pretty horrible
conditions in the Republic

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:44.160
of Congo.

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.180
That kind of thing, which
happen under Dodd-Frank

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:50.340
could be the beginning of the
SEC demanding more and more

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:52.380
environmental social
governance measures.

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:55.980
If that were to happen, we
could see some real changes

00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:57.230
in corporate practices.

00:28:57.230 --> 00:29:00.520
So I think this is a case
where open data, because it's

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:02.670
of interest not only
to citizens, but also

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:05.040
to the investor community,
can have a lot of leverage

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:07.480
in improving corporate behavior.

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:10.340
We're seeing open data
shape reputation and brand

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:11.930
in some powerful ways.

00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:14.170
Part of this is
public complaints

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:17.080
and what happens when you make
complaints about a company

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:17.900
public.

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:19.900
So these two people
founded a company

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:24.280
called PublikDemand, which
takes complaints from consumers,

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:27.440
amplifies them through
social media to an extent

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:31.070
that a company like
AT&amp;T or United Airlines

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:33.320
has to immediately
pay attention.

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:38.070
And in many cases they've
gotten very rapid solutions

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:40.830
to problems that otherwise
would have gone back and forth

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:42.630
with customer
service for months.

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:45.510
Well this is a strategy that
regulatory agencies are also

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:46.010
following.

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:48.780
The Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau in particular

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:51.350
has made its complaint
database public.

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:53.790
And banks are now paying
much more attention

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:55.790
to customer complaints
and customer satisfaction

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:58.060
than they ever would have
because of this open data.

00:29:58.060 --> 00:29:59.670
Both "Forbes" and
"American Banker"

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:02.086
have written about how this
is really changing the banking

00:30:02.086 --> 00:30:04.790
industry, because they
have to listen collectively

00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:08.360
to consumers whereas they could
ignore people one at a time.

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:12.410
The next stage of this, I think,
is analyzing social media.

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:15.342
Since we are now at this stage
of 2 billion tweets a week

00:30:15.342 --> 00:30:16.800
which is-- I don't
know about you--

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:19.020
I find that somewhat terrifying.

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:22.400
But not only through the
kinds of reviews and comments

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:24.990
people do on Google, but
these other sites as well.

00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:29.980
We're seeing a whole huge amount
of social media commentary

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:33.020
and you would think that if
you could actually figure out

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:35.670
how to analyze this and
do something with it,

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:38.090
you would have a very powerful
form of open data that

00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:40.020
has huge business relevance.

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:42.240
Well one company that
is working on this

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:45.920
is reputation.com, which is in
the business of helping people

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:49.010
improve their online
reputations mostly by promoting

00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:52.320
more positive and
genuinely positive

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:54.730
feelings about what
they have to say.

00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:58.200
But there is a whole
other level of this--

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.010
of sentiment analysis--
which many of you

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:01.260
may be familiar with.

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:04.090
So I always like to
ask how many people

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:06.740
know who the woman
on the left is?

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:09.410
How many people know who
the guy on the right is?

00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:13.010
OK, at least a couple generally
in every tech audience

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:15.200
more people
recognize Alan Turing

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:18.410
than recognize Jane Austen
but that's who they are.

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:21.710
And if Jane Austen and Alan
Turing had a love child,

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:23.560
it would be sentiment analysis.

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.720
Because sentiment
analysis essentially

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:30.730
is this technique of doing
text analysis to figure out

00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:34.360
what people feel about
brands, celebrities,

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:37.940
TV shows, specific products,
specific services, et cetera.

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:40.910
There is an annual conference
now held in New York-- well,

00:31:40.910 --> 00:31:43.480
I think it's usually
New York-- every March

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.750
where people get together
talk about this stuff.

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:47.180
It's a chapter in my book.

00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:49.530
I've also done a
podcast with a guy named

00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:51.910
Seth Grimes, who's
a guru in this area.

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:53.170
That's on my website.

00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:54.390
It's absolutely fascinating.

00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:55.802
It's not yet a
mature technology,

00:31:55.802 --> 00:31:57.760
but ultimately you can
see where this is going.

00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:00.370
This is going towards
treating all of social media

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:03.380
as an analyzable,
quantifiable form of open data

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:07.570
that can have a lot of
implications in a lot of areas.

00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:10.680
Personal data is a
specific kind of open data

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:15.880
in that this is about making
data about my medical records

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:18.820
available to me, or
like Opower, my energy

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:21.180
usage available to me.

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:23.380
It doesn't really fit
the classic definition

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:24.020
of open data.

00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:26.230
It's not like available
to everybody for free,

00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:29.220
but it's a very important
part of the ecosystem.

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:33.700
Partly because opening data to
me is a different kind of thing

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:36.000
that me not being able
to access my own data.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.610
And also because in many
applications of big open data,

00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:43.250
having the ability to match
it up with personal data

00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:46.470
is an important
part of the puzzle.

00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:49.540
This is actually the diagram
from a report by the World

00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:50.370
Economic Forum.

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:52.710
They've now done a
couple of reports

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:55.010
on unlocking the value
of personal data.

00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:57.240
The basic idea that
people are talking about

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:59.670
is what if you could
establish a data vault.

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:04.930
So I'm seeing this as probably
a concept that many of you

00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:06.060
thought about a lot.

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:07.840
It's been kicking
around for a while.

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:10.350
It may or may not be getting
to a point the applicability

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:10.990
or maturity.

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:12.656
There are companies
like reputation.com,

00:33:12.656 --> 00:33:15.870
personal.com in DC, and others
that are looking at this.

00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:17.560
But the basic idea
is, if you had

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:20.340
access to your personal data,
if you can hold it securely,

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:25.400
and if you could then release
it selectively to other people

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:27.120
or to marketers,
what would happen?

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:30.810
Well one model, which is being
called vendor relationship

00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:34.210
marketing by Doc Searls who
talks about it in his book,

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:36.060
"The Intention
Economy," one model

00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:40.370
is that instead of marketers
targeting you, you target them.

00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:45.200
It is worth about $2,000
for a Mercedes Benz dealer

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:48.390
to get a qualified buyer on the
lot based on the probability

00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:49.830
that they're going to buy a car.

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:53.780
So it might be worth a couple
dollars for that person

00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:57.830
to find you if you wanted
to release demographic

00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:59.330
or whatever kind
of information that

00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:00.746
made you look like
a good customer

00:34:00.746 --> 00:34:02.630
and actually pay
you to make a visit.

00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:05.114
That's a kind of
simple form, but some

00:34:05.114 --> 00:34:06.530
of the people
working in this area

00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:08.449
think there's a lot
economic potential there.

00:34:08.449 --> 00:34:11.750
I think it's still
hypothetical, but at least

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:13.870
points towards the
greater degree of consumer

00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:16.909
control over how we
are all marketed to.

00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:18.350
On the other end
of the spectrum,

00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:21.330
there is potentially
tremendous public value

00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:23.159
in sharing personal data.

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:27.340
This is this app PulsePoint,
which is essentially

00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:31.040
if you are a person who knows
CPR, you tell them that.

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.780
If there's somebody who
is having cardiac arrest,

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:36.920
they then immediately
send a message

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.397
to everybody nearby
who knows CPR.

00:34:39.397 --> 00:34:41.480
They can get to them faster
than an ambulance can.

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:44.130
They can potentially
save a life.

00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:45.920
So this is the use
of personal data

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:47.753
that I'm not sure anybody
would have thought

00:34:47.753 --> 00:34:49.926
of a couple years ago,
but it's the kind of thing

00:34:49.926 --> 00:34:51.800
that when you start
thinking of personal data

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:55.750
as a form of open data on a
voluntary basis some really

00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:57.330
interesting things can happen.

00:34:57.330 --> 00:34:59.970
They talk about themselves as
enabling citizen superheroes

00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:03.500
and I think that's
actually pretty accurate.

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:07.540
Open data and research-
this is another area where

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:10.310
I think we're going to see
potentially huge benefits.

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:13.040
We're seeing more and more
interest and more and more

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:16.420
pressure for particularly
biomedical, but potentially

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:21.036
other kinds of scientific
research to be more open.

00:35:21.036 --> 00:35:22.660
Now a couple things
are happening here.

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:25.060
One is the open access
movement with which, of course,

00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:29.630
Aaron Swartz was very
involved in promoting

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:32.320
and very tragically in the end.

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:34.269
But that's very much
about one state,

00:35:34.269 --> 00:35:36.060
as in a published
journal, we shouldn't all

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:38.450
have to pay thousands of
dollars to get at that data

00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:40.180
in order to get at that report.

00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:42.110
And the federal
government recently

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:44.460
announced just a couple
weeks ago that about half

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:49.620
of all federally-funded
research will now

00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:51.580
have to be made publicly
available for free

00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:54.290
online within a year of
its publication in journal.

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:55.870
That's sort of after the fact.

00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:57.370
What gets even
more interesting is

00:35:57.370 --> 00:35:59.970
data sharing while the
work is in progress.

00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:03.560
So a lot of this is coming
from patients and from funders.

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:07.540
Kathy Giusti was a corporate
CEO in her 30's when

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:09.660
she discovered she
had multiple myeloma.

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:12.780
She quickly discovered that
there was very little research

00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:13.420
being done.

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:15.540
She started a foundation
to fund that research.

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:18.170
And a condition was if
you take their money,

00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:21.420
you have to make your
data openly available

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:23.550
as you make new discoveries.

00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:26.280
This is in many ways the model
that the Human Genome Project

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.880
worked on very successfully.

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:29.970
It's now being followed
in Alzheimer's research

00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:32.480
and Parkinson's research
and in other ways as well.

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:36.310
It is potentially a
transformational change

00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:37.870
in how we do science.

00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:40.050
If the business models
are worked out and if

00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:42.440
there's enough cooperation
from scientists

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:44.440
and from drug
companies and others

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:46.430
to really make this the norm.

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:49.570
We're also seeing a lot of
very successful experiments

00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:51.530
in crowd-sourcing science.

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:54.080
One of the most famous was done
at University of Washington

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:54.880
a couple years ago.

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:57.270
They had been working
for a decade trying

00:36:57.270 --> 00:37:00.150
to solve protein structure for
protein related to the AIDS

00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:00.880
virus.

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:02.840
They decided to put
it on the site Foldit

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:04.490
and asked gamers to solve it.

00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:06.560
Gamers solved it
within a couple weeks.

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.840
They published in "Nature"
and they thanked the gamers

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:09.680
publicly.

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:13.200
This was, I think, eye-opening
for a lot of people.

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:17.140
Another example, any of you
know Galaxy Zoo or Zooniverse?

00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:20.730
This is one of the great
citizen science projects

00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:22.780
and it's really a
model for many of them.

00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:27.080
This thing got started in Oxford
because some poor PhD student

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:31.330
had to look at images of the
structure of spiral galaxies,

00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:35.980
which apparently computers
cannot assess very well.

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:39.490
And he had hundreds of
thousands of these to look at.

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:41.740
He looked at 50,000
in a week and he

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:43.850
said there's got
to be a better way.

00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:46.790
They decided that the better
way was posting these images

00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:49.694
online, inviting just
ordinary people look at them.

00:37:49.694 --> 00:37:51.610
They can do it with a
high degree of accuracy.

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:53.700
They've now taken on
other scientific projects,

00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:55.770
like cancer cells
as you see here.

00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:58.690
They have tapped
800,000 volunteers

00:37:58.690 --> 00:38:01.800
to help them do
skilled human work

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.460
in the interest of science.

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:06.790
And then finally SkyTruth is
applying the same kind of thing

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:08.310
to the environment.

00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:12.040
This is a nonprofit
in the Washington area

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:15.820
that is now using crowd sourcing
to look at things like maps

00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:18.450
of areas of Pennsylvania
where fracking is going on

00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:21.670
and look at signs that fracking
is damaging the environment.

00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:23.890
So this becomes
environmental protection

00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:25.690
through open data
from the satellites

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:29.130
and crowd sourcing
applied to that open data.

00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:33.140
Data driven cities is a
huge movement right now.

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:40.830
Right at NYU we have the Center
for Urban Science and Progress,

00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:42.750
which is doing a lot
of work in this area.

00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:45.530
The idea is to put sensors
all over cities, to instrument

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:48.110
cities, to see what
can be learned,

00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:51.550
to improve operations, public
health, emergency management,

00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:52.840
all kinds of things.

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:56.010
You're also seeing a lot of
use of data for accountability

00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:57.660
in cities like Chicago.

00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:00.330
Palo Alto has been
a leader here.

00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:02.240
And there are a couple
of interesting things

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:03.073
to come out of this.

00:39:03.073 --> 00:39:05.210
One is applications
like NextBus,

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:09.250
which is now over the country,
where city traffic data can

00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:12.670
be used to help you figure out
when your next bus is coming

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:15.070
so you're not waiting
endlessly in the rain.

00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:18.160
To things like this
experiment in Washington

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:22.090
where they have actually
solicited public input

00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:25.234
about how the different
government agencies are doing.

00:39:25.234 --> 00:39:27.650
So they've actually been able
to grade government agencies

00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:30.310
on the basis of both survey
data that they collect

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:32.020
and sentiment analysis
of what people

00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:33.410
are saying on social media.

00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:35.720
When they first did this,
four out of five agencies

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:37.860
got a c minus one got a c plus.

00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:40.490
They were not very happy with
the mayor for doing this,

00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:42.270
but they have gone
public with it.

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:44.250
It's a really
interesting feedback loop

00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:46.990
and over time, the
grades have gone up.

00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:48.800
So now the last
trend and this is

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:51.710
one where we're really
intensely focused at NYU--

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:54.800
is trying to figure out when you
look at all of this together,

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.430
what is open data worth?

00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:58.020
And this is an
important question

00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:01.520
because it is not a slam
dunk or particularly

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:04.600
easy to take data that has
traditionally been siloed

00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:05.932
and open it to the public.

00:40:05.932 --> 00:40:07.890
So there have been a
number of studies on this.

00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:10.340
The most recent was
McKinsey study last October

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:13.520
that says that open data
is worth $3 trillion a year

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:14.610
worldwide.

00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:17.290
That's by far the highest
estimate anybody has come up

00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:19.940
with as you can see from some
of the other ones on the screen.

00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:22.740
But generally the
estimates run pretty high.

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:25.479
So it's a very
interesting challenge

00:40:25.479 --> 00:40:27.020
we all think there's
potential there,

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:29.451
but what we have done
at the GovLab at NYU,

00:40:29.451 --> 00:40:31.700
is we've set out to do this
thing called the Open Data

00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:36.866
500, which is about figuring
out exactly where the value is.

00:40:36.866 --> 00:40:38.240
Beginning in the
business sector,

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:40.490
but ultimately wanting to
look at the nonprofit sector

00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:41.320
as well.

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:43.330
We're looking at the
US based companies.

00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:45.530
We have actually contacted
more than 500 of them.

00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:47.622
We're in the process
of finalizing the list.

00:40:47.622 --> 00:40:49.080
If this interests
you, I would urge

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:51.740
you to please go to
opendata500.com because we

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:54.250
are really seeking public
comment on everything

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:56.200
from individual companies
to our methodology

00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:57.610
to whole goals of the study.

00:40:57.610 --> 00:41:00.790
Or you can tweet to hashtag
#OD500 if you have suggestions

00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:01.720
for us.

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:06.230
We have this now on a website
as a work in progress,

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:09.920
where you can filter
by state or by category

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:13.200
and see where some of these
open data companies are.

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:15.550
Not surprisingly the greatest
numbers are in California,

00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:17.160
but I'm glad to say,
as a New Yorker,

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:18.930
that New York is not far behind.

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:21.830
And we're beginning to see
some interesting patterns here

00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:24.680
that I think are really
going to be meaningful.

00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:28.100
So one of those patterns, which
I'll show you in a second,

00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:31.439
helps answer some of the open
questions about open data.

00:41:31.439 --> 00:41:32.980
So having shown you
all these trends,

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:34.000
and shown you all
the stuff that's

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.270
happening that I talked
about my book and the website

00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:39.820
and my other work, there's
still a lot we don't know.

00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:43.750
And I would say there's three
major questions that where

00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:45.790
now all looking to answer.

00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:49.590
So the first one is, OK if
we think open data has value,

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:52.010
which sectors are
the most promising?

00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:54.607
Well from the Open Data
500-- even though this

00:41:54.607 --> 00:41:57.190
is preliminary, I can't stress
that enough because this is not

00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:59.190
a final list, et
cetera-- but we're

00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:01.760
starting to see
some hints of that.

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:04.640
So the first tier, the
company's the sectors that

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:06.640
have the most
companies in them are

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:08.620
what we're calling
data slash technology

00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:10.290
and finance and investment.

00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:12.390
Finance and investment
probably because there's

00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:14.330
so much interest,
and because SEC data

00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:16.540
and other kinds of business
data has been out there

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:19.400
for a long time and
is a very rich source.

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:23.330
Data technology because there
is a whole huge emerging

00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:26.370
sector in helping
figure out how to take

00:42:26.370 --> 00:42:29.450
really unwieldy government
data sets and turn them

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:30.860
into usable open data.

00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:34.920
So this is companies like
Socrata, Junar, OpenGov here

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:38.670
in Palo Alto, or
nearby, and many others.

00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:43.170
That their business is making
open data business-friendly.

00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:45.520
And one of the
interesting questions

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:46.979
is whether this is
something that's

00:42:46.979 --> 00:42:49.436
going to be around forever,
which I think it probably will,

00:42:49.436 --> 00:42:51.340
as we were talking about
a little bit before.

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:54.620
Or how much this sector
may change as governments

00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:56.600
get better at
releasing open data.

00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:58.300
Next we have health
care-- which I

00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:02.080
think is emerging--
transportation, energy,

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:05.500
and then the third tier,
where only about a couple

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:09.910
percent the companies we have
are in each of these areas.

00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:11.930
This includes a number things.

00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:15.460
Many of which are really quite
significant like education,

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:18.310
scientific research,
environment, food

00:43:18.310 --> 00:43:20.840
and agriculture, the climate
corporation for example,

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:23.380
is somewhere in this tier.

00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:26.200
So we just have a couple
of initial observations

00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:27.340
and caveats about this.

00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:29.830
One is that sectors that
don't have a lot of companies

00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:31.530
in them, like weather
and agriculture,

00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:33.720
may have a climate
corporation in there

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:36.180
or may have a very
significant company.

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:38.564
So simply number of
companies per sector

00:43:38.564 --> 00:43:40.980
doesn't necessarily tell you
the importance of the sector,

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:42.438
but it does tell
you at least where

00:43:42.438 --> 00:43:44.830
a lot of the
entrepreneurial activity is.

00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:47.605
We still have to do more work
we are getting information

00:43:47.605 --> 00:43:49.480
on the number of employees
per company, which

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:50.970
is going to be an
important metric.

00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:53.400
We're trying to get information
on financial metrics

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:55.430
and as I said the data
technology category.

00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:57.980
I was very interested
to see that so high up

00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:00.400
and I think it says
something about the sorry

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:02.360
state of government data.

00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:04.430
Which leads directly
to question number

00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:07.525
two- how do we improve
the open data ecosystem?

00:44:07.525 --> 00:44:09.650
Having worked in the federal
government for a while

00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:11.150
and talked to people
a lot agencies,

00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:13.210
I can tell you a lot of those
government data sets are

00:44:13.210 --> 00:44:14.910
a mess and the people
who run them know it.

00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:16.701
And they are trying to
fix it, but it's not

00:44:16.701 --> 00:44:17.980
going to happen overnight.

00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:20.570
So there are a couple
things that are happening.

00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:25.770
On a city level, OpenGov, which
is a company right near here,

00:44:25.770 --> 00:44:29.190
has developed what they like
to call kind of a Sim City

00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:31.410
for actual cities.

00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:34.660
So they have this thing you
can see in the upper right,

00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:39.110
where they can take budget and
other city data from any city,

00:44:39.110 --> 00:44:41.130
put on a platform
that makes it usable,

00:44:41.130 --> 00:44:44.090
and that also makes a comparable
to other cities' data.

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:47.960
And they can then make town
meetings much more productive.

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:51.970
They can tell you why Palo Alto
has a certain rate a police

00:44:51.970 --> 00:44:54.090
overtime and how that
compares to San Mateo

00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:56.590
and they can learn things about
city governance from that.

00:44:56.590 --> 00:45:00.050
So this is one of those data
slash technology companies

00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:02.520
that's beginning to make
the data more useful.

00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:05.200
Another one which is a
couple blocks from us at NYU

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:06.510
is called Enigma.

00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:11.660
They won TechCrunch Disrupt
in New York last May.

00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:13.470
And what was
significant about that

00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:16.810
was, not just what they got
this nice large $50,000 check,

00:45:16.810 --> 00:45:19.080
but that I think there
was a recognition of how

00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:20.650
important data companies are.

00:45:20.650 --> 00:45:24.030
Their whole thing is taking
really unwieldy government

00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:25.810
federal data sets
and making them

00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:28.470
usable on a common platform
and interoperable ways.

00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:30.220
And they're getting
a ton of attention

00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:31.880
right now because
this is something

00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:34.046
that everybody who has ever
worked with federal data

00:45:34.046 --> 00:45:34.810
has wanted.

00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:37.960
And the reason for that is
that right now federal data

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:40.240
looks something like this.

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:42.750
For those of you who have seen
"Raiders of the Lost Ark."

00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:44.490
The pathetic thing
about this is not only

00:45:44.490 --> 00:45:46.950
the federal data is this bad,
but that this is the metaphor

00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:49.450
that everybody in the federal
government who works with data

00:45:49.450 --> 00:45:52.530
uses to describe the
state of federal data.

00:45:52.530 --> 00:45:55.110
It is that bad and we know it.

00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:57.230
There's good stuff
in there somewhere,

00:45:57.230 --> 00:45:58.660
but good luck finding it.

00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:01.950
A lot of the work going on in
government and in third parties

00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:05.130
like Enigma and like OpenGov is
to make this stuff more useful.

00:46:05.130 --> 00:46:07.949
And the open question is how
can we really make this work?

00:46:07.949 --> 00:46:09.490
And this is an area
where I certainly

00:46:09.490 --> 00:46:11.180
think certainly
Google has done a lot

00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:13.290
and has a huge role to play.

00:46:13.290 --> 00:46:14.830
I think also part
of this is going

00:46:14.830 --> 00:46:17.344
to be what I'm calling
demand-driven data disclosure.

00:46:17.344 --> 00:46:19.510
The way it's worked in the
past, government agencies

00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:22.030
have largely released open
data when they've identified

00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:23.722
data set they think
are of interest,

00:46:23.722 --> 00:46:25.430
or where they're just
doing it to compare

00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:27.370
to comply with the
government mandate.

00:46:27.370 --> 00:46:29.830
One of the things we want to
get out of the Open Data 500

00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:33.450
is to create a kind of round
table, where data users can

00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:35.890
give much more ongoing
feedback to data holders

00:46:35.890 --> 00:46:37.150
in the government agency.

00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:40.080
We think this is going to really
improve the quality of data,

00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:42.840
the availability of data,
and the ecosystem as a whole.

00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:45.270
And then finally, how
can developing countries

00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:46.400
use open data?

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:48.880
This is a huge question that
the World Bank among others

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:50.552
is putting a lot of effort into.

00:46:50.552 --> 00:46:52.010
I'm going to be on
a panel for them

00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:54.520
the next Wednesday
afternoon in DC.

00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:56.060
And there's a
couple of areas here

00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:57.850
one is fighting corruption.

00:46:57.850 --> 00:47:01.030
This is the website that
has I think the best

00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:04.446
name of any website I've seen
it is called ipaidabribe.com.

00:47:04.446 --> 00:47:06.780
This is a website in
India, where you can go

00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:09.900
and through crowd
sourcing report if you

00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:13.070
had to pay bribe in a way that
makes corruption transparent

00:47:13.070 --> 00:47:15.180
and ultimately
decreases corruption.

00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:18.490
But we're also looking
to go beyond transparency

00:47:18.490 --> 00:47:20.370
to economic development
and a lot of people

00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:22.990
are asking whether developing
countries can use all the data

00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:24.730
as a business resource
in the same way

00:47:24.730 --> 00:47:27.320
that we're seeing in the US,
the UK, France and places

00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:28.360
like that.

00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:32.760
So one of my colleagues of the
World Bank, Prasanna Lal Dass,

00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:34.520
recently did a
very good blog post

00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:36.650
summarizing some of the
things that are needed.

00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:39.420
As you can see, it's
going to take some work,

00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:40.810
but the rewards may be great.

00:47:40.810 --> 00:47:42.560
And I'm seeing a lot
of interest right now

00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:46.550
in figuring out how to make that
work and can we make it work.

00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:50.359
So that's the open
data universe at least

00:47:50.359 --> 00:47:52.650
as I've come to see it through
the work I've done here.

00:47:52.650 --> 00:47:54.025
I would recommend
you to a couple

00:47:54.025 --> 00:47:55.640
of sources for more information.

00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:58.940
One is at thegovlab.org,
where you can see our wiki,

00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:00.080
subscribe to our digest.

00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:03.961
You can also sign up outside
to get a digest subscription.

00:48:03.961 --> 00:48:04.960
It comes out every week.

00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:10.050
It's a curated collection
of material in this area.

00:48:10.050 --> 00:48:12.350
There's opendatanow.com,
where I report

00:48:12.350 --> 00:48:13.749
on this stuff on
a regular basis,

00:48:13.749 --> 00:48:15.790
largely with interviews
with people in the field,

00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:17.760
pod casts when I can
do them, hopefully

00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:19.350
as a resource to the community.

00:48:19.350 --> 00:48:21.910
And there is of course
this book now available,

00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:25.290
which I see many of you have
already purchased thank you

00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:30.460
and which I hope you find
useful in one way or another.

00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:32.410
So we have a couple of
minutes for questions

00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:34.690
and thank you very much.

00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:35.238
Thank you.

00:48:37.830 --> 00:48:39.080
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:40.490
I have two questions.

00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:44.640
one is, if you develop your
business using open data,

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:48.380
what are the caveats, what is
the license on all this data.

00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:52.250
And the second question,
suppose I want some data.

00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:53.360
Where would I find it?

00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:55.080
For example I would
like to see some data

00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:58.580
on education broken
down by gender.

00:48:58.580 --> 00:48:59.400
Where would I go?

00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:00.540
Where do I even start?

00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:02.620
JOEL GURIN: OK so
two questions, one

00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:05.080
is in terms of the
license use data.

00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:07.430
It is only open data
if it's released

00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:09.460
under an open license
that makes it usable

00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:12.350
by anybody, and reusable,
and re-publishable.

00:49:12.350 --> 00:49:15.320
So by definition,
that's pretty much built

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:17.870
in to the Open Data Policy,
at least of the US government,

00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:19.790
more and more governments
recognize that.

00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:21.270
In terms of where
you go, if you're

00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:23.440
looking for federal data,
you should go to data.gov,

00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:27.720
this is the central
repository of federal data.

00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:31.960
It was originally built in a
way that I think a lot of people

00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:33.880
found not as user-friendly,
as they want it.

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:34.880
They've just relaunched it.

00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:35.588
It's much better.

00:49:35.588 --> 00:49:37.000
It's getting better
all the time.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.950
But that's where you would
find data like that segmented

00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:41.910
by agency and by
area of interest.

00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:43.167
As a start, in any case.

00:49:43.167 --> 00:49:44.000
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.961
Obviously, you logically
focused on the US.

00:49:46.961 --> 00:49:49.210
Is there any other nations
that you'd point to as best

00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:51.320
in class who are really
leading the field in terms

00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:53.830
of leveraging the
infrastructures developed

00:49:53.830 --> 00:49:56.760
in their governments
or in their societies.

00:49:56.760 --> 00:50:00.660
JOEL GURIN: Yes the UK is
really the other world leader

00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:02.290
and in many ways
they're doing things

00:50:02.290 --> 00:50:04.300
in a more advanced
way than the US.

00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:06.185
For example, their
equivalent of data.gov

00:50:06.185 --> 00:50:08.200
is all done with link
data is really very

00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:10.070
beautifully and
very well designed.

00:50:10.070 --> 00:50:12.860
So they are in some
ways ahead of us

00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:14.110
in some ways learning from us.

00:50:14.110 --> 00:50:16.760
They also have an institute
there called the Open Data

00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:19.494
Institute that is funded
partly by the government

00:50:19.494 --> 00:50:20.910
of by other sources
as well that's

00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:24.650
doing a ton of work really
global leadership in this area.

00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:28.780
Beyond that, we're
seeing a lot of interest

00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:31.350
all over the world
on every continent.

00:50:31.350 --> 00:50:33.930
And I think what's happening is
that different countries as I

00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:36.940
mentioned there now 60 countries
or so in the Open Government

00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:40.190
Partnership, which is committed
to these open government

00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:42.930
principles, part of which
is open government data.

00:50:42.930 --> 00:50:46.299
And it's rapidly emerging as
an international movement.

00:50:46.299 --> 00:50:47.840
I think different
countries depending

00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:49.700
on the stage of
development will figure out

00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:51.658
what is the most important
and most appropriate

00:50:51.658 --> 00:50:53.935
form of the data
for them to release.

00:50:53.935 --> 00:50:55.310
AUDIENCE: So all
the applications

00:50:55.310 --> 00:50:57.660
of open data that you
mentioned are all vertical.

00:50:57.660 --> 00:50:59.902
They're trying to solve
a particular problem.

00:50:59.902 --> 00:51:01.360
Do you see a need
or an opportunity

00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:04.040
for more horizontal
plays of products

00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:06.890
that could be usable by
many applications that

00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:07.585
use open data?

00:51:07.585 --> 00:51:08.960
JOEL GURIN: Well
I think probably

00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:11.840
the best examples of those are
these data technology companies

00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:15.430
like Enigma or OpenGov, because
what they're essentially

00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:19.220
trying to do is to make data
of all kinds more usable.

00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:21.410
And I think what
they're hoping to do

00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:26.500
is to make possible the kinds
of mash-ups or interoperability

00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:30.440
of data that can make a lot of
those more complex applications

00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:31.250
possible.

00:51:31.250 --> 00:51:33.770
Right now, at least if you're
working with US federal data,

00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:34.820
it's very difficult.

00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:36.970
We did a project at
the GovLab simply

00:51:36.970 --> 00:51:41.410
to try to mash up EPA and
OSHA data about factories

00:51:41.410 --> 00:51:43.562
and facilities that
both agencies regulate.

00:51:43.562 --> 00:51:45.020
You would think
this was dead easy.

00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:45.770
It's not.

00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:48.010
I mean even on that
basic level, it

00:51:48.010 --> 00:51:50.810
takes work to make this
stuff these data sets work

00:51:50.810 --> 00:51:51.897
and play nicely together.

00:51:51.897 --> 00:51:53.980
So companies that are
making that happen, I think,

00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:56.320
are definitely taking that
kind of broad horizontal view

00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:58.153
whether they're going
to be helpful to a lot

00:51:58.153 --> 00:51:59.130
of other companies.

00:51:59.130 --> 00:52:00.060
Yes?

00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:00.740
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:03.870
Do have any comments
about Aaron Swartz

00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:06.445
who tried to liberate some
common government data

00:52:06.445 --> 00:52:08.510
but got sued by the government.

00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:14.410
JOEL GURIN: Yeah I write about
Aaron and that in my book.

00:52:14.410 --> 00:52:17.440
I think everybody pretty
much recognizes now

00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:21.440
that MIT was not a good path
there, to say the least.

00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:26.490
And it gets into
some complexities,

00:52:26.490 --> 00:52:28.840
but I think the short answer
is what Aaron was really

00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:33.470
fighting for was open access
and access to material that

00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:36.580
has already been published in a
way that the public can use it.

00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:40.140
That's now just become
federal government policy

00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:43.620
for about half as I
said of the research

00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:45.180
that the federal
government funds

00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:48.200
so I think there's a greater and
greater recognition that he was

00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:51.760
right about that and that we
should start getting on board.

00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:54.616
AUDIENCE: How do you think
about accuracy, or even just not

00:52:54.616 --> 00:52:55.990
necessarily
accuracy, but knowing

00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:58.690
what's in the data set, like
keeping track of the metadata,

00:52:58.690 --> 00:53:00.200
like what's actually
being counted.

00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:03.695
Who was excluded, who wasn't,
how data was collected,

00:53:03.695 --> 00:53:05.070
and that kind of
information that

00:53:05.070 --> 00:53:06.560
can change what the data means?

00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:08.268
JOEL GURIN: Yeah that's
a great question.

00:53:08.268 --> 00:53:11.370
I would say right now that's
very hard part of the Open Data

00:53:11.370 --> 00:53:15.030
Policy is to actually
publicly release information

00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:16.714
about the quality of data.

00:53:16.714 --> 00:53:19.130
I think this is going to be
one of the parts of the policy

00:53:19.130 --> 00:53:22.860
that federal agencies
absolutely hate the most.

00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:25.060
But there are some really
interesting examples

00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:27.140
of agencies facing
up to this problem

00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:29.150
and dealing with it so
one great example is

00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:31.930
USAID-- international
development--

00:53:31.930 --> 00:53:35.590
knew that they had
lousy geospatial data

00:53:35.590 --> 00:53:38.880
on the organizations they
were giving grants to.

00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:42.410
They put on a hack-a-thon,
but a very careful one.

00:53:42.410 --> 00:53:45.590
They found people who are
sort of geospatial hackers

00:53:45.590 --> 00:53:46.610
in the Washington area.

00:53:46.610 --> 00:53:48.187
They invited about
100 people in.

00:53:48.187 --> 00:53:50.770
They said, we're going to give
you special access to our data.

00:53:50.770 --> 00:53:51.949
We want you to fix it.

00:53:51.949 --> 00:53:53.240
We'll give you all the weekend.

00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:56.240
They were done in
about 15 or 16 hours.

00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:58.889
So this idea of kind of
crowd-sourcing quality control

00:53:58.889 --> 00:54:00.680
is one that a couple
of government agencies

00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:01.980
have become interested in.

00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:04.610
But simply knowing is very hard.

00:54:04.610 --> 00:54:07.190
And that's one of
the reasons that I

00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:09.780
think establishing
feedback loops-- really

00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:12.390
good feedback loops between
data users and the agencies

00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:14.740
that hold the data-- is going
to be critical next step.

00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:17.240
So that we can ask those
questions government agencies

00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:18.900
We can see what the response is.

00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:20.950
And where there is a
really serious flaw

00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:23.180
in a really important
data set, they

00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:28.020
can prioritize that as something
that stakeholders need fixed.

00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:31.160
AUDIENCE: And so you showed
a lot of great examples.

00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:34.090
I was wondering if you
think that we can leverage

00:54:34.090 --> 00:54:38.410
mobile in a specific way as
opposed to the desktop sites.

00:54:38.410 --> 00:54:39.200
JOEL GURIN: Yes.

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:42.320
I tend to show desktops because
they look better on PowerPoint,

00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:44.920
but absolutely most
of these things

00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:47.040
that I showed either
are mobile apps

00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:49.070
or could be mobile apps as well.

00:54:49.070 --> 00:54:50.990
I think the one
caveat on mobile apps

00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:57.217
is that we are a little bit risk
of app mania with open data.

00:54:57.217 --> 00:54:58.800
There have been all
these hack-a-thons

00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:01.630
of apps for this or apps
for that, which is great,

00:55:01.630 --> 00:55:05.310
but I think there are probably
some limitations in what

00:55:05.310 --> 00:55:07.687
is easy to do in that
mobile environment.

00:55:07.687 --> 00:55:09.520
And there are some more
sophisticated things

00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:14.510
that can be done if you, I
believe, look more broadly.

00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:16.930
But definitely
pretty much anything

00:55:16.930 --> 00:55:20.180
that I showed you has a mobile
application attached to it

00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:20.930
FUMI YAMAZAKI: OK.

00:55:20.930 --> 00:55:21.740
Thank you very much.

00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:23.115
I think we're
running out of time

00:55:23.115 --> 00:55:25.480
but Joel will be
staying here for us.

00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:26.320
Thank you very much.

00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:27.903
JOEL GURIN: Thanks
so much for coming.

00:55:27.903 --> 00:55:30.900
And thank you for the
work you're all doing.
