00:00:13.612 --> 00:00:16.983
Like I have all my random
phases, is to do collars up,

00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:18.551
like a collared shirt.

00:00:18.584 --> 00:00:21.421
And I have words on the back,
like yeah, I see you looking.

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:23.289

00:00:27.893 --> 00:00:29.095

00:00:29.128 --> 00:00:30.163
But anybody--

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:31.130

- Two watches.

00:00:31.163 --> 00:00:31.998
Just on the same wrist.

00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:32.865
East coast, west coast.

00:00:32.898 --> 00:00:34.934
That's how I was--

00:00:34.967 --> 00:00:37.070
let me make sure
this is said on TV--

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:41.874
I was the first comedian to wear
lights on his shoes on stage.

00:00:41.907 --> 00:00:42.842
The first.

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:44.043
Gary Owens, I saw you.

00:00:44.076 --> 00:00:45.445
Nick Cannon, I saw you.

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:46.579
Lights?

00:00:46.612 --> 00:00:47.280
I was the first.

00:00:47.313 --> 00:00:48.247
Listen, I love--

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.515
Four years ago.

00:00:49.548 --> 00:00:51.751
I love that that's
what pissed him off.

00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:52.718
Nothing else.

00:00:52.751 --> 00:00:53.920
Didn't give me no credit.

00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:55.521
I love that
that's what pissed--

00:00:55.554 --> 00:00:58.291
these motherfuckers stealing
the lights on the shoes, man.

00:00:58.324 --> 00:00:59.592
Lights on the shoes.

00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:00.426
Two watches.

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:01.294
So you're a trendsetter.

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:02.495
A trendsetter.

00:01:02.528 --> 00:01:03.196
Trendsetter.

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:04.597
In my head, at least.

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:05.898
That's not in your
head. that's what you are.

00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:06.866
Yeah, yeah.

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:08.334
That's what you're doing.

00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:09.769
Talk to me about
this right here.

00:01:09.802 --> 00:01:11.404 line:7%
"Grown and Sexy."

00:01:11.437 --> 00:01:15.475 line:0%
This is a comedy night
with grown, serious--

00:01:15.508 --> 00:01:18.444 line:0%
I've seen very many
of these on the ground.

00:01:18.477 --> 00:01:22.381
Very-- listen, hey, you guys,
when y'all take the flier?

00:01:22.414 --> 00:01:26.085
Just say-- I'd rather
you say no then throw--

00:01:26.118 --> 00:01:27.019
then throw it in the trash.

00:01:27.052 --> 00:01:28.087
Throw it in your purse.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.422
Throw it in the
back of your car.

00:01:29.455 --> 00:01:31.624
Don't throw it on the
ground after you done

00:01:31.657 --> 00:01:34.026
looked me in the face,
said you was coming.

00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:35.194
You know what?

00:01:35.227 --> 00:01:37.230
I'm gonna be-- I
ain't got nothing.

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:40.566
I ain't got nothing to do.

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:44.303
Fast-forward to 10 seconds
later and it's everywhere.

00:01:44.336 --> 00:01:46.172
You ever picked one up and
chased the person down.

00:01:46.205 --> 00:01:47.406
Absolutely.

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.110
Miss, I just saw
you drop the flier.

00:01:51.143 --> 00:01:53.446
Mama, you know you
better than this.

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.479
It's time for you to
do what you do best, man.
