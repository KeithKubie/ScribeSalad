00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:22.620
[silence]

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.110
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Good afternoon
and welcome, everybody.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.130
And we are so glad to have you
here at the Library of Congress

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.490
for this unique opportunity
with Edoardo Albinati,

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:35.860
one of the most interesting

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.010
and original contemporary
Italian writers,

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.840
but intellectual in general.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.570
But, I need to thank you,
Edoardo Albinati for being here,

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.420
accepting our invitation.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.500
I know you have a lot of
appointments around town,

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.970
so making time for this
was very generous of you.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.920
And I also want to
mention our co-sponsors

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.920
who made this event possible:
New Academia Publishing

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.290
and especially Dr. Anna
Lawton, and Italians in DC

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.380
and the book club ParoLab.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.370
Finally, of course, I need to
mention the Italian Embassy

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.290
and the Italian Cultural Institute

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.690
who are also participating
in this event.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.500
So. Excuse me.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:35.140
I'm just going to get
organized a bit.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.950
Let's start with a difficult
introduction of Edoardo Albinati

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.250
because your career is very
impressive and you are, I believe,

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.390
a Renaissance man we
could say in some ways.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.800
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: I didn't
realize there was a Renaissance

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.180
in Italy, so if I am one of
these men, I'm very proud just

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.820
because it means that
there is a Renaissance.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.120
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Ah, okay.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.480
Let's hope there is a
Renaissance and there was.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.280
Dr. Albinati was born
in Rome in 1956.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.890
He comes from a northern
Italian family.

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.550
His mother was from Piemonte

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.520
and the father's family
was from Lombardy in Italy.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.580
That is the northern part of Italy.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.700
He attended the private
school of San Leone Magno,

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.240
in the so called Quartiere
Africano di Roma.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.900
It is called Quartiere Africano?

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.320
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI:
Quartiere Trieste.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.620
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Quartiere Trieste.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.030
No need Quartiere Africano
in particulare.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.040
Okay. The streets are named
after African countries

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.120
but Quartiere Trieste
is (inaudible).

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:50.730
Okay. He is here to celebrate
with us his award winning novel

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.810
for which he won the Premio
Strega in 2016, and we're talking

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.960
about his neighborhood
and his background

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.770
because that is a significant
part of his latest novel.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.070
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: Yeah,

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.770
that is the best part
maybe of this neighborhood.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.070
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Oh Coppedè.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.370
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: yeah.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.670
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Quartiere Coppedè.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.760
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: Realized
in a sort of late liberty style.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.670
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Very fun to wander
around that Quartiere Coppedè

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.290
and notice all the
various fountains.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.420
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: Very good
as a set for horror movies.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.900
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Dario Argento.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.530
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI:
Yeah Dario Argento.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:31.830
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Certo.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.500
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: Dario Argent
shot his first movies there.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.800
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Yeah.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.600
So I want to do something
slightly different here.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.180
We're not going to only
concentrate on his latest novel

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.900
because I'm happy to say that we
have almost every book written

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.550
by Edoardo in our collections
here at the library.

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.440
There are a couple missing
but maybe I can acquire them

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.510
in the next future.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.380
So, I want to focus on your
overall career rather and talk

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.570
about also some other books, say
some Svenimenti, Sintassi Italiana

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.960
because I think that is as
interesting as your latest novel

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.680
for us here at the Library
of Congress and in America.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.350
We were talking about
San Leone Magno,

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.690
the private catholic
school he attended.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.690
You also attended Li Giulio
Cesare for the last period

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.340
of your high school years.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.470
This is all very important,
we're touching upon it

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.450
because again Roma is so much
part of your works in general

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.480
and in particular, these
places, these locals are

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.340
so much important for
his latest novels.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.820
They're almost the main characters
at time in the latest novel.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.380
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI:
Yeah, that's correct.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.990
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Giulio Cesare is
also a very particular high school

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.210
and it became iconic
in our culture, right?

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:06.850
Because there was an
assault, a terrorist assault,

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:12.850
at the Liceo Giulio
Cesare in the 1980s.

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:20.780 position:56%
Rome at the time Edoardo was growing
up and frequenting these schools

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.520
and going to the Giulio
Cesare, that was later 1980,

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.290
was a very complicated
place to live in because

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:36.240
of all the terrorist attacks
but also the student movements,

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.520
and feminist movements, and
protests every day but mainly

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.440
because these were the
years in which Italy

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:51.430
and Rome saw this very tragic
phenomenon of the Anni di Piombo,

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.410
the so called Lead Years.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:58.610
We will talk some more about that.

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:03.400
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: So, I am moving on.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.560
We keep all these main bits in mind
because they're going to be part

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.250
of our conversion later
but Dr. Albinati graduated

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:17.340
from Rome's University La Sapienza,
which is also my alma mater

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.380
and with the thesis
supervised by Walter Pedullà

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.450
who was a very important, and
is still an Emeritus Professor

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.930
at the University of Rome.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.680
The University of Rome
had some of the most,

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:40.700
the finest Italian literary minds
and historians of the 20th century

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:47.090
and so it was honestly a wonderful
place to study and work in,

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:51.850
in spite of the terrorist attacks
and what that might have created,

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.600
and the protests that
might have created some

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.360
fragmentary experiences.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.980
So, as I was saying Albinati
is a Renaissance man,

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:06.760
in the sense that he isn't only
a novelist, he isn't only a poet

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.400
but you also translated
some important works,

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.770
English works into Italian.

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:18.510
Nabokov is one of them if
I recall and also Milton.

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:20.400
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: I
adapted Milton for the theater.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.000
It was not really a translation.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.440
It's impossible to translate.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.740
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Yes.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.520
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI:
I just cut and paste.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.820
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Okay.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.820
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: Very freely.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.120
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Freely?

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.420
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: Free.

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.720
[crosstalk] patient.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.450
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Well,
you have to with Milton.

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.250
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: But
I liked that very much.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:42.550
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: I love-

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:45.690 position:56%
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: I like very
much cutting, more than translating.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:46.990
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Okay.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:48.500
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI:
Cutting and translating that.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:54.110
Adaptation is something a little
different from translation

00:07:54.110 --> 00:08:00.440
but it's a good work for a writer.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:05.930
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Yes, learning the
inner dynamics of writing and ...

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:10.790
So we were saying, it would
take me a very long time

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:17.940
to mention all the various
not jobs but professions

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:26.160
that Dr. Albinati has been
doing- screenplay writer,

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:33.250
radio broadcaster, editor, literary
critic, novelist, essayist, poet,

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:39.310
and also a reporter, a
reportage in Afghanistan.

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:51.430
But one of the other main jobs,
I'm sorry, that Edoardo is known

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:55.310
for is he teaches in
Rome's prison Rebibbia.

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:59.700
It's a very important part
of your professional life

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.510
and I think you're
still doing that, right?

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:03.810
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: Yeah.

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:05.110
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Okay.

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:06.410
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI:
That's actually the ...

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:13.760
All the other jobs I did them for
a while, this one is the only one

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:17.160
that I still do after 24 years.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.680
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: And
you teach Italian?

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.430
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI:
Italian and history.

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:21.730
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Okay.

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:23.030
Wonderful.

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:24.330
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI:
But more Italian

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:29.810 position:56%
because I don't know history very
well so I tend to, I prefer to focus

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:32.320
on language and literature.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.620
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Right.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:36.480
One of the works we're going to
focus on Maggio Selvaggio is also

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.330
about your work at Rebibbia.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:44.610
Since 1984 you collaborated also

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:47.560
with the literary journal
Nuovi Argomenti,

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.570
collaborated as an
editor, Redattore.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:53.660
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: I think
I stopped in this year.

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:54.960
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Okay.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.260
All right.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:57.560
Okay, so I have-

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.190
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI:
I quit in this year.

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:00.490
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Okay.

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:04.460
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: I have a very
confused idea about my career.

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:05.760
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: That's-

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:10.270
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: As I told you,
when I saw the books over there,

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:15.710
I don't have many of
them so I'm happy-

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:17.010
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Wonderful.

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:19.610
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: -in
some place they're kept.

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:22.830
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: We'll do some
facts-checking, which is something

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:26.970
that we are all doing very often.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:32.310
These are maybe real facts but we
need to look into this particular.

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:37.280
So, I mentioned Nuovi Argomenti
because it is also part

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.460
of our collection here
at the library.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:44.800
I happen to find the first two
numbers of the Nuovi Argomenti,

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:50.820
which was founded in
1953 by Alberto Moravia

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.940
and Alberto Carrocci,
two very, very ...

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.450
two giants of Italian literature.

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:57.370
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: That's why ...

00:10:57.370 --> 00:10:58.670
I'm sorry.

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:00.710
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Yes,
please interrupt me.

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:02.010
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI:
Because I'm sure,

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:06.960
since Moravia died in 1990, I quit.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.260
That's for sure.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:09.910
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: So it's 1990.

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:11.770
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI:
That's for sure.

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:15.260
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: By that
time, you had quit.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.560
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI : Yeah.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.860
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Your first novel
Il Polacco Lavatore Di Vetri,

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:27.940
the Polish windshield cleaner, was
published by Longanesi in 1989.

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:32.490
It provided material for a
movie, which was directed

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:37.790
by Peter Del Monte
and released in 1998.

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:42.730
We will talk more about
this novel but you went

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:51.150 position:56%
on to write other novels, Svenimenti
published by Einaudi in 2004.

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:58.630 position:56%
Tuttalpiù Muoio with Filippo
Timi, published by Fandango in 2006,

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.660
which we do not have yet
and I was telling you

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:05.660
that I would love to acquire it.

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:09.680
Dr. Albinati also wrote collections
of short stories starting

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:13.840
with his very first one is
Arabeschi Della Vita Morale,

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:19.840
another item that is not
yet in our collections

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.150
but we have almost everything.

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:27.600
Orti Di Guerra followed
in 1997 followed by 19,

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.510
which we also have
outside in our display.

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:36.170
Voci Nel Buio in 2005
by the publisher Charta.

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:43.910 position:56%
We received 920 books, a donation
from Charta when they closed in 2014

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:47.670
and Giuseppe Liverani was
here for that occasion.

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:52.760
I noticed that in particular and
I think it's important to tie

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:58.610
in publishers, authors
and the milieu

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:08.360
of the whole situation and context.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:14.370 position:56%
Anyway, progressing with Dr.
Albinati's career as an intellectual

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:17.750
and a writer, he wrote another
short story collection Guerra

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:19.050
Alla Tristezza!

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:23.670
published in 2009, sorry I
was switching to Italian,

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:27.080 position:56%
published in 2009 by Fandango again,

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:30.750
which seems to be one
of your main publishers.

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:33.210
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: It's
100 meters from my house.

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:38.910
It's the main reason I
publish some of my books there.

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:40.210
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: That's great.

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:42.250
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: It's
in the Quartiere Trieste.

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:43.740
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Yes.

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.070
Practical.

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:46.740
But he also wrote poetry.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:49.270
So we don't only have
prose but poetry.

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:52.750 position:56%
Sintassi Italiana published in 2002.

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:59.570
He wrote autobiographic works
such as Maggio Selvaggio,

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:04.150 position:56%
which we mentioned before, refers to
his work as a teacher in the prison

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:08.050
of Rebibbia, not to mention
his exceptional reportage

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:11.480
from Afghanistan, Il Ritorno:
Diario Di Una Missione

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:14.670
In Afghanistan published in 2002.

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:19.640
Now this doesn't do you justice but
I just needed a brief introduction

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:25.200
and we will move on to the
next phase of our event,

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.430
which is our conversation proper.

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:30.860
But, I love the fact that you
interrupted me and please continue

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:34.100
to do that because it will
flow more as a conversation

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:39.040 position:56%
and help me relax a little bit more.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:43.570
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: So, First of all,
a very brief personal question.

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:45.270
I'm very curious about this.

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:49.910
How did your family
happen to move to Rome,

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:53.120
to be in Rome, from Northern Italy?

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.690
I'm always curious about
people coming to Rome and-

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:59.050
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: I must
confess that I don't know.

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:05.250
I never studied my family history

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:11.510
and my parents gave us short
information about their past.

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:16.230
I only know that my father
was the son of a builder

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:23.100
and Rome was a good place to work.

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:28.930
So there was a strong immigration
in Rome, not only from the South

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:32.920
as is usually thought,
but also from the North.

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:41.570 position:56%
Many northerners came to Rome, this
town, Rome was I think 80,000 people

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:46.800
and it became the capital of Italy.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.970
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: The
capital of Italy, yeah.

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:53.930
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: To become
a metropole like it is now means

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:58.780
that they had to build
buildings and many ...

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:06.050
I think maybe 20% of the
population have immigrated in town.

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:07.920
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: From elsewhere.

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:09.320
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: My
father was an engineer

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:16.520
so he wasn't not let's say a worker
but he made projects and made money

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:22.410
as well because it is
quite a typical character

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:25.220
of Rome, the builder.

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:27.510
The middle-

00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:30.190
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Upper-middle class.

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:31.970
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI:
Upper-middle class in Rome,

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:35.550
the builders are very important.

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:41.320
Now they decline but especially
in the years, in the fifties

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:46.690
and sixties, some of them were
good and made a lot of money.

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:51.560
My father, not too much
but much more than me.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:57.030
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: This is interesting
because Rome is again much part

00:16:57.030 --> 00:17:00.830
of your work in general and it has
a very interesting history also

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:05.930
of being a capital, like
Washington D.C., with few people

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:09.090
who are really seven
generation Roman

00:17:09.090 --> 00:17:11.740
or seven generation Washington D.C.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:15.000
and so I just wanted
to remark on that.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.950
You lived in Rome.

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:22.760
You were born in Rome, you
grew up in Rome and you lived

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:26.940
in Rome throughout your life
but you lived through one

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:29.210
of the most difficult
times in modern history,

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:33.720
the so called Lead
Years, Anni di Piombo.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:39.440
Rome was an epicenter but the
Anni di Piombo affected all

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:44.680 position:56%
of Italy-Milan, Turin, and so forth.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:49.620
How did that period mark you
and what do you recall of it?

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:52.640
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: Well,

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:59.730
this period has been called the
Lead Years by the press, by movies

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:05.650
but I would like to
correct this idea,

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:10.570
or this let's say "idée fixe",

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:14.570
saying that this period was
probably a period of lead and gold

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:19.580
at the same time so it was
not only a period of violence,

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:26.430
or the violence at the same time
produced good and bad things.

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:29.670
I was not really affected.

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:36.650
I was twenty- let's see,
I was twenty-something

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:40.660
when all this started to happen.

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:46.820
It was not the organized
terrorism, the real military groups

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:52.830
like [inaudible] from the
left or from the right.

00:18:52.830 --> 00:19:00.500
I was more interested, and affected
and directly involved in the fact

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:06.760
that during this period
it was very easy to kill.

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:15.700
For small groups, you didn't need
to belong to strong organization,

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:23.100
revolutionary, you could just, as
I tell in my book, my last book,

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:27.940
you can just spend one afternoon
deciding with your schoolmates

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:32.080
who do you want to
kill the day after.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:38.340
Taking from a list of
enemies, political enemies,

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:45.690
some of them quite casually
chosen, others like symbols,

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:49.460
other just like personally hate.

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:55.980
This world was the main issue.

00:19:55.980 --> 00:20:04.220
The fact that death was so
easy to administer, to give

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:08.190
and sometimes to be given.

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:15.110
And this is something that happened
especially in these neighborhood,

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:21.650
that was apparently built just
to be a very safe and calm

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:28.690
and bourgeois neighborhood, like
it was built with the purpose

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:34.360
of nothing happening,
nothing except having ladies

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:39.780
with the small dogs around,
or people running and walking.

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:43.440
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Because it's
near Villa Borghese also

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.740
so it's a very residential
part of town.

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:48.320
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: It's a
residential place, quite neutral

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:52.620
and that's probably exactly
this fact, this neutrality

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.030
that attracted these forces.

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:56.330
It was like-

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:57.630
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: A haven?

00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:03.960
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: -sometimes I
make comparison with the sport ring

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:09.860
or a sport field in which nothing
is there but everybody can happen

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:16.330
because that two different
teams, they fight there,

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:24.190
and it was quite impressive
because from 75

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:31.270 position:56%
to 82 there were more people killed,

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:36.310
left and far wing militants,
policemen, judges-

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:37.610
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Politicians.

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:42.690
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI:
-politicians, girls in this place.

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:49.050
But the first great crime
was not a political one,

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:54.260
or maybe it was a political one but
was a sexual crime, the one that is

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:55.560
at the center of my book.

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:59.550
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Yes, so I was
setting the stage also for violence

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:06.340
because violence as you say it was
ubiquitous, this sense of violence.

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:08.210
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI:
That's why Dario Argento

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:14.790
in a way understood the
hidden quality of this place,

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:21.520
the subterranean violence
that was inside this building.

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.600
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: I don't
know if everybody knows

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:29.830
about the latest novel we are
talking about, La Scuola Cattolica,

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:34.390
so would you like to just introduce
because we were talking about 1975,

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:41.040
about this episode that is
at the center of your book.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:44.440
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: Yeah, it's
not the main argument when we talk

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:48.730 position:56%
about the book but it's actually
correct to say that it is the center

00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:54.380 position:56%
of the book, and it's the only
reason why I wrote this book instead

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:56.270
of another one.

00:22:56.270 --> 00:23:00.110
The fact that in this
school, San Leone Magno,

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:13.210 position:56%
some students one year older than me
in September 75, so the school was

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:18.920 position:56%
over actually for us, we were out of
school, we were at the university,

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:24.920
or I mean starting with
the university, college,

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:32.050 position:56%
they kidnapped two girls, they
brought these girls in a place close

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:37.150 position:56%
to Rome to the sea, a very beautiful

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:42.480
but at the same time quite
scary place called Monte Circeo,

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:48.090
the mount of the ancient
magician Circe.

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:58.210
They abducted them, these two
girls, there and during two days

00:23:58.210 --> 00:24:08.260
and a half orgy, they raped them,
killed them or to say better,

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:11.990
they killed just one
of these two girls

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:15.270
but they thought they
were killed both of them.

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:22.700 position:56%
Then they put the two corpses
inside the car and went back to Rome

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:28.870
and left the car just under the
place in which one of them lived

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:33.420
and went to have an ice
cream during the night.

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:38.680
After a while, the girl who
survived started to make-

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:41.010
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: To knock on the -

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:42.580
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: -to knock on

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:45.480
and to make noise and
the police arrived.

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:46.780
They opened this ...

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:49.380
How do you call it?

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:50.680
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: The boot.

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:51.980
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI:
The boot of the car

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:54.190
and they didn't understand
what was inside.

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:57.400
There is a very famous photograph

00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:01.320
because for a strange chance there
was a photograph, not a police one.

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:05.020
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: I know, I wanted to
put it up there but, it's scary.

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:09.140
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: I think that
no kind of literature or words

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:12.860
or telling can compare
this photograph

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:20.100
in which the girl's still
alive, all covered with blood,

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:23.480
comes out the boot and
just in this moment,

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:28.460
the caraboneers understand
that the other strange-

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:30.400
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Bungled
up in a blanket.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:35.010
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI:
-blanket is that girl.

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:38.940
Two of these killers
were taken just in ...

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:45.160
because they were buzzing
around as sometimes they say

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:51.450
that the murderers, they don't want
to leave the place in which ...

00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:56.190 position:56%
they want to be captured and
actually it is exactly what they did

00:25:56.190 --> 00:26:01.430
because they were captured,
because they were found at three

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:04.290
in the night walking around.

00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:11.760
The third one actually was
never arrested and after a long,

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:19.980
long chase around the world,
it has been discovered in 2005

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:30.120
that he's dead and he's buried
in Morocco under a false name,

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:39.450
under a false identity of,
how do you say a Legionario?

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:41.870
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: French legionary.

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:47.590
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: But of the
Spanish branch of the Legion.

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:51.510
So apparently he's dead.

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:52.810
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: So I-

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:54.680
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: I know
they were my schoolmates,

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:58.960
that's the only reason
why I wrote this book.

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:03.690
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: This is the clue
of the book but really as you say,

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:07.050
it's not the main focus
of your book, right?

00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:14.190
Because the main focus is La Scuola
Cattolica, education in Italy,

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:20.540
masculinity models, sexual
education and so forth.

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:25.910
So the great part of
your book is the context.

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:27.210
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI:
The context, right.

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:31.110
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: An investigation
of the context that led

00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:32.860
to this murder, this crime.

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:35.030
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: I
don't know if it led-

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:36.330
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Led, yes.

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:38.210
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: -really led,
mechanically led to this crime

00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:42.440
but as a writer I thought
that it was useless

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:48.570
and I could not add anything to the
things already written and known

00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:56.780
if I write about the crime
but I could write something

00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:02.360
about the families in which were
very similar to mine family,

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:09.670
the family of [inaudible], the same
school, the priests, our teachers,

00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:19.770
the idea of male identity, this
was only-male school at that time.

00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:24.520
After just five or six years
I left school it became ...

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:28.940
How do you say misto?

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:30.240
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Co-ed.

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:31.540
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: Co-ed.

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:32.840
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Yes.

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:34.140
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: Only because,

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:36.120
not because of any
ideological progress just

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:40.590
because to have more students
because the simple thing

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:49.780
of not having girls after a while
takes the school to the collapse.

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:54.700
So let's say that all the
things that were written

00:28:54.700 --> 00:29:01.410
about this crime were written until
my book to mark the difference

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:04.600
between let's say, people like me,

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:08.810
or people like normal
people and the killers.

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:15.080
While I wrote about all we had in
common, all the similar things,

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:19.290
all the things we share,
I share with them.

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:22.900
I think there are two
different kinds of morality.

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:28.310
The very easy one is to
separate yourself from the evil

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:35.010 position:56%
and this was the reaction especially
from the male part of the public.

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:39.170
They are monsters, we have nothing
to do with this kind of violence,

00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:46.280
we condemn it, we don't want
to be in any way compared

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:48.350
or confused with the killers.

00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:53.800
There is another level of morality,
more difficult to deal with that is

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:57.020
to discover and to analyze

00:29:57.020 --> 00:30:01.460
and to tell what actually
we have in common with them.

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:07.460
What part of us is
contaminated by the same evil.

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:09.250
Also, because I think that a crime

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:15.560
like this one was really
contaminating, very contaminating.

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:22.200
All the quiet society of this
neighborhood, all the families,

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:26.600
all girls and boys and
parents were like ...

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:30.840
How do you say?

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.390
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: An enclave?

00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:35.570
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: Something
happened and it was impossible

00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:42.490
to take the time back and
except to try to separate, to-

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:44.970
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Refuse any-

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:48.030
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: -refuse
any discussion about that

00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:52.830
because it's something
that cannot be faced.

00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:56.760
I tried with my book to
face it in the easiest way.

00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:01.530
The easiest way that is sincerity.

00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:02.850
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: So it's
a responsibility.

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:06.880
You feel this as a
moral responsibility.

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:11.120 position:56%
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: Usually I don't
like very much the use of moral

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:19.730
when you write but there is a moral
position in writing that is writing

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:26.740
without rhetoric, and without
indignation, without false passion,

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:34.580
without pretending to be
scandalized by what you are

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:37.210
because you are the scandal.

00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:38.510
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Right.

00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:40.690
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: So don't
be afraid to be a scandal.

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:45.560
While very often especially in
Italian literature, there is a sort

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:55.700
of self-absorbing position in
which the writer judge the reality

00:31:55.700 --> 00:32:00.170
and like separating good from evil.

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:01.470
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: So.

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:04.630
Wow, already?

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:06.810
Oh well. Great.

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:13.790
I wanted to go back to your other
works because they are so much part

00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:21.400
of your career but also they
depict another version of Rome

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:28.080
and Rome's life and your life in
Rome but time goes by so quickly.

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:35.600 position:56%
So, at this point, let's just insert
something about your first novel

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:37.610 position:56%
because it's another aspect of Rome.

00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:44.170
We're talking about all this
mentality, this lifestyle

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:49.880
and customs in Rome especially
of a particular class, right?.

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:52.620 position:56%
But Rome is also immigration, right?

00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:56.860
You have demonstrated
an interest also.

00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:02.300
It's like a civic and socially
engaged interest although you work

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:06.360
on it with some sort of flair

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:09.960
because Il Polacco Lavatore
di Vetri, your first one was

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:16.940
about Polish immigrants in
Rome and a very common vision

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:19.920
for any Roman stopping
at the traffic lights

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.910
and you would have these
Polish, but not only Polish-

00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:25.350
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: At
that time, they were Polish.

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:28.120
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: -cleaning
your windshield, right?

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:36.970
But yours is like an ironic take on
this section of Rome's population

00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:40.840
and immigration in
Rome at that time.

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:46.340
Tell us more about this
aspect also of this city.

00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:52.100
Immigration at that time and
how it affected life in Rome

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:56.100
but also how is immigration
affecting Rome today?

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:57.400
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: Well,
when I wrote the book,

00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:02.270
the immigration was a
very, very thin phenomenon.

00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:08.990
It was caused more by the
fact of having a Polish Pope.

00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:13.650
So, at that time during the
crisis of the Eastern countries,

00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:19.620
this was the first time we had
immigrants because you know

00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:25.770
that Italy has been a country
of people who were going abroad

00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:33.050
so we were the immigrants usually
for more than 60 or 70 years

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:35.250
from the beginning of the century

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:42.430
until the sixties or...It has
officially been declared finished,

00:34:42.430 --> 00:34:47.610
the Italian immigration
abroad, in the seventies.

00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:54.910
Exactly in the same years, the
process started to go the other way

00:34:54.910 --> 00:34:59.860
around and the first ones to
arrive were the Polish people

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:05.110
and this was very, very strange for
the common image of the immigrant

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:09.650
who comes from the South of
the world, so he's darker,

00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:15.010
so is the usual one,
the one who's happening,

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:18.820
people come from Africa
or from wherever.

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:26.070
In this case, we had these blond,
tall, sometimes very handsome man.

00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:28.970
At the beginning there
were just men.

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:31.760
It was a very strange ...

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:38.490
I must confess, more than from the
civic, or political or ethic point

00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:44.350
of view, I was astonished by
the estetico presence of these,

00:35:44.350 --> 00:35:50.250
let's say angels, it's very easy
to start working with the fantasy

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:54.680
about his fact, being
carefully, being tall

00:35:54.680 --> 00:36:01.350
and blond they were perfectly
matching the idea of,

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:06.790
especially in a Southern country
as Italy is, where blond is-

00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:08.090
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: The perfection.

00:36:08.090 --> 00:36:09.540
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI:
-the perfection of light

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:13.230 position:56%
or the pure or the good or whatever.

00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:19.960
So I wrote a pure fiction novel
about them without knowing at all

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:25.540
that I was the first
one to deal with this,

00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:30.500
that in few years it would
have become a real issue,

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:34.150
a real political issue not
because of Polish but because

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:41.980
of all other ethnic immigration.

00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:47.830
Until now there is a European
problem, very, very heavy,

00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:54.150
and Italy is just like there in
this position so it's the door

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:58.990
of all this while 90%
of the people arriving.

00:36:58.990 --> 00:37:05.980 position:56%
They don't want to stay in Italy,
they just want to cross Italy and is

00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:10.670
at the same time easy and
very difficult for them.

00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:13.810
That's the reason why.

00:37:13.810 --> 00:37:20.390
I didn't imagine that
I was opening an era

00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:23.780
because I was just
interested in this.

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:26.910
For the most, some
of these characters

00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:31.490
in these novels are taken
straight from mythology.

00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:39.410
So the very beautiful girl, Polish
girl, is like heroine all good.

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:41.350
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Classical yeah.

00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:43.940
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: Very
classical and I didn't think

00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:51.240
to make a political statement
about something that was not

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:54.290
at the time a political issue.

00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:57.270
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: I brought that
topic because it clashes also

00:37:57.270 --> 00:38:05.720
with the type of picture you
painted, the Roman bourgeois

00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:13.270
in Coppedè, in Quartiere
Trieste, this kind of enclosed type

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:16.900
of community that is shocked
by the murder you talked about

00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:24.140
but also there are other parts of
Roman life and society at the time

00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:29.590
that are probably shocking also
for people of the same background

00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:34.660
and it was interesting that you
wrote about immigration way ahead

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:38.530
of time, way before the
problem really emerged.

00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:45.810
I am sorry but the time is expiring
quickly and I would like you

00:38:45.810 --> 00:38:51.130 position:56%
to be able to also ask some
questions so I don't want to hog all

00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:56.020
of the time we have left and I
don't know how much time we do.

00:38:56.020 --> 00:39:01.400
Okay. So I am going to let
you ask whatever question,

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:07.940
allow you to ask any questions
and please feel free to ...

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:12.350
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE MEMBER: Did you
personally know those students

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:15.580
who did the crime and did you ever
imagine they could do something

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:16.880
like that?

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:21.470
And did they get sentenced,
through the judgment?

00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:24.490 position:56%
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: Yes I knew them
because I was in school with them

00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:31.760
and furthermore, one of the
two, Angelo Izzo, had a brother,

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:36.880
a smaller brother who was in
my classroom so it was my age.

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:44.210
The killers were born one year
before me but I went very often

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:50.960
to the house of Angelo Izzo
to study with his brother,

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:56.370
being at that time the family
quite ...having a lot of children

00:39:56.370 --> 00:40:03.240
of these middle-class families,
it was quite common to have

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:11.410
in these only-male school two or
three brothers of different age.

00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:16.750
So yes, I knew them very well
and I felt they were bastards

00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:22.450
but with this kind of ...

00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:27.800
The way in which you're a bastard
in school, nothing more than this,

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:35.540
they punch in the face someone
or they broke the glasses of one

00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:40.340
of my schoolmates, but
they did things ...

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:43.350
They were fascists-

00:40:43.350 --> 00:40:44.680
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Bullies.

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:50.830 position:56%
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: No, it was more
like a political color let's say

00:40:50.830 --> 00:40:57.030
but they showed the way of being
fascists not in a political way

00:40:57.030 --> 00:41:00.260
but more with arrogance, with ...

00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:06.900
But I didn't know when the big
crime had happened that just

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:13.240
after the school they were
already being on trial for rape.

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:19.940
I didn't know that because leaving
the school I didn't follow their

00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:21.620
stories and paths.

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:31.890
So, they were already in
judgment for the rape of one girl

00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:35.690
and then they upgrade this area.

00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:37.110
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Progressed.

00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:40.150
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE MEMBER: They went on to
jail then, they were not in jail?

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:42.090
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: They
were in jail for a while

00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:44.160
because they were released
on parole,

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:50.030
after a while there was a very
strong economical compensation

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:53.560
to the victim of the first rapes.

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:59.940
But, after that, they
were sentenced for life.

00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:03.640
But in Italy, you are
sentenced to life

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:07.530
but usually we don't
do more than 30 years.

00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:15.030
So the real reason why I wrote
the book is the fact that in 2005,

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:20.070
so exactly 30 years after the
first crime, one of them that was

00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:25.310
on parole committed another crime.

00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:32.600
He killed two women,
mother and her daughter.

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:37.460
The daughter, she was
like 14 years old.

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:39.940
It was not a sex crime.

00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:44.920
He just strangled them
and buried them.

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:50.480 position:56%
This was the reason I wrote the book
because if there wasn't this return

00:42:50.480 --> 00:43:00.100
of flame, it was like the eternal
return of the blood of the crime,

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:06.100
that obliged me in a way to
reconsider the first story

00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:10.760
because I didn't want
to write about that.

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:15.410
I've been called, I can't
call it really a vocation.

00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:16.710
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Yes.

00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:18.010
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI:
A calling, a vocation.

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:23.830 position:56%
In 2005 and after one year of trying
to understand how to tell the story,

00:43:23.830 --> 00:43:26.230
what to write about, I started.

00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:32.080
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE MEMBER: I'm really
curious about your activity,

00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:39.930
also about your activity
as a teacher in prison.

00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:43.250
You said that you teach
history and Italian.

00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:47.350
The Italian language
or also the literature?

00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:48.650
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: Both.

00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:51.300
Both. I have to teach
Italian to Italians.

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:52.760
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE MEMBER: Right, I
was going to ask since you spoke

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:58.380
about immigration, if your
students are all Italians or also

00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:01.510
from other places, or countries.

00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:05.630
It's a novel question I guess.

00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:11.600
I'd like you to say more about what
the motivation of these inmates is

00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:13.540
for studying especially literature.

00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:14.840
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: Spend time.

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:16.620
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE MEMBER: I can see
the reasons for history but also-

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:20.420
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: I can
answer immediately, spend time.

00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:21.800
Spend time.

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:26.220 position:56%
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE MEMBER: Because it's a
way for them to engage in something.

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:28.650
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: It's
a way of doing something.

00:44:28.650 --> 00:44:30.460
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE MEMBER: How
is that useful to them?

00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:32.820
And why literature
than something else?

00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:34.370
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: I teach
in a school that has ...

00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:40.060
The main aim of the school is ...

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:46.500
How do you say, informatic.

00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:52.980
So I'm the teacher of Italian but
among the professors of Math or-

00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:54.320
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE MEMBER:
Computer science.

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:57.420
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: -computers
or whatever, I'm the only one

00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:02.690
who makes humanistic teaching.

00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:12.440
But the main push for them is to
go out of the room, how do you say?

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:15.000
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Do something useful-

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.670
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: To do
something, to spend time-

00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:18.970
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: -purposeful.

00:45:18.970 --> 00:45:20.270 position:56%
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: -to see people.

00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:23.570
To see people who are not
guards, or who are not lawyers.

00:45:23.570 --> 00:45:26.670
So we are the only-

00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:30.640
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE MEMBER: They wouldn't
be interested in that otherwise.

00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:32.900
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: I think
the main interest is a human one

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:35.640
and not really-

00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:36.940
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Intellectual.

00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:38.240
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI:
It's not intellectual.

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:39.540
It's not purely intellectual.

00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:43.860
There are some of them
who are like young nerds.

00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:48.080
Nerds are everywhere, also in jail.

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:53.600
But it's just one in 100 let's say.

00:45:53.600 --> 00:46:02.400
It's an interesting place
for teaching because-

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:08.850
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE MEMBER: [inaudible]

00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:10.150
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: Who knows?

00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:14.440
I don't know if they
studied in jail.

00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:19.500
Studying in itself
is not a warranty.

00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:27.080
It doesn't give you any insurance
against the fact that continuing,

00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:30.910
keeping on your criminal
life or not, that's for sure.

00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:38.360
I teach the son of a patriarch
to a Moroccan coke dealer.

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:46.480
I don't know if this is going
to change his life or as soon

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:51.090
as he will be released, he
will start again, selling

00:46:51.090 --> 00:46:53.970
and buying the same stuff.

00:46:53.970 --> 00:46:55.310
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Comet Zero.

00:46:55.310 --> 00:46:57.750
He'll not just imagine.

00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:59.660
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: Zero
unfortunately is dead.

00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:06.390
Zero is the boy I opened this
book with, it was a very,

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:14.750
very fat boy who died
of a dose just two years

00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:19.710
after the book was written.

00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:25.440
Also the fact of having this kind
of students that changes a lot,

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:32.080
are released, or die, or they
are moved to other prisons,

00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:41.420
teaches you to be very focused on
having outcome almost immediate

00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:45.090
from every single hours
you spend there.

00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:50.420
You cannot make plans for
five years, for the future.

00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:53.540
So the future doesn't exist
at all, there is only present.

00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:57.810
This time, this one, the same
hour we are living now together

00:47:57.810 --> 00:48:00.560
in this moment and
we have to squeeze

00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:06.440 position:56%
from this hour everything we can
because we don't know, I don't know,

00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:10.450
now I live, for being
here I'm a liver,

00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:13.980
I will be next Monday again there

00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:21.970
and probably there will be
something changed among my men.

00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:30.420
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE MEMBER:
[inaudible] this crime of Circeo.

00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:39.070
You say many times that the press
was focused on the killers but not

00:48:39.070 --> 00:48:43.880
on the ladies, we almost know
anything about them and especially

00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:48.850
about the girl who survived,
we've lost her traces.

00:48:48.850 --> 00:49:01.400
We know that she survived and
then we don't know anything else

00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:02.700
about her.

00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:10.880
I was wondering why you too don't
tell anything of the book on her?

00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:12.230
As long as that would be
for a reader interested to,

00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:15.890
not only to have an insight on the
killers but also on the victim.

00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:17.530
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI:
That's a good point.

00:49:17.530 --> 00:49:22.620
It was made many times about this
book but I can write only ...

00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:30.230 position:56%
I didn't make any research about the
killers as well, I just knew them.

00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:39.100
I just knew how they felt, how
they thought, how they lived

00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:43.030
and I could use all my
imagination and fantasy

00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:49.340
to make an intensification of
these things that I already knew.

00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:52.870
I knew nothing about the
victims and I didn't want to.

00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:58.860
And I didn't want to make a
book about let's say balanced,

00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:02.400 position:56%
sort of the killers and the victims.

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:04.140
So it's just about the killers.

00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:06.170
It's just about men.

00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:10.500
All the female characters are like-

00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:11.800
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: In the background.

00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:14.380
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI:
Background or the up or down.

00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:17.470
They are never in the center.

00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:23.880
It's a quality or maybe a
failure of the book, I don't know

00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:30.610
but I didn't want to
invent on victims.

00:50:30.610 --> 00:50:35.420
Someone did in Italy, someone
wrote a really awful book

00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:40.500
about the thought of the
victim or especially the one

00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:43.840
who didn't survive, fantasizing

00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:47.640
about what she felt
during the the [inaudible].

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:53.210
I felt it was out of my
reach so that's why ...

00:50:53.210 --> 00:51:01.700
The school is only-male school
and this is only-male book.

00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:10.900
There are sisters, mothers,
fiancées, women raped ...

00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:13.730
But they're always like-

00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:17.080
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE MEMBER:
Secondary characters.

00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:20.280
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: Yeah,
they could win the Oscar for-

00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:21.580
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Runner up.

00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:28.260
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: -how do I
say, supporting roles in this case.

00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:31.360 position:56%
The next book is even more balanced.

00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:40.620
But this one- a very interesting
fact that happened is that many,

00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:50.370 position:56%
many women read the book because she
was interested in this male world.

00:51:50.370 --> 00:51:56.660
So, it's quite strange that almost
nobody complained about the fact

00:51:56.660 --> 00:52:02.700
that there were no, or such a
few parts for women in this book.

00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:14.160
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you
very much for this conversion.

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:16.570
A comment and a question.

00:52:16.570 --> 00:52:22.120
As I hear you speak, you know,
there is two words that keep

00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:29.320
on coming back to me,
that is individuality

00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:35.050
and also the word, "roles."

00:52:35.050 --> 00:52:44.480
You have a series of roles
in displaying who you are.

00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:52.340
I'm curious, I noticed you
would comment on your place

00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:54.380 position:56%
because it's kind of like a garland.

00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:57.270
You flourish here, and you
flourish in another area,

00:52:57.270 --> 00:52:59.060
and in another area, and while-

00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:00.360
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI:
I flourished in-

00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:01.660
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: No no you don't.

00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:02.960
You just flourished.

00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:04.260
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE MEMBER: I don't
want to say what is the world

00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:05.560
of the writer and what
is your world?

00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:12.050
But I'm curious as to how you see
yourself in this place and time.

00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:18.260 position:56%
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: To be sincere,
to me the problem is just of energy,

00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:22.120
it's just a physical problem.

00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:33.030 position:56%
The fact that I have to waste a lot
of energy around, scattering around,

00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:36.440
that's why my career
is so contradictory

00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:39.210
as a writer and also as a man.

00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:41.460
I did many different
things just because I had

00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:49.100
to spend myself somewhere,
somehow, in different directions.

00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:59.340
Only in the end I hope will be sort
of design in this going around.

00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:04.030
Also, this book is so different
one from the other will probably

00:54:04.030 --> 00:54:11.750
at the end, I hope this
end will be not so soon,

00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:15.670
but will form a shape,
a significant shape.

00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:20.840
But the reality is that
I have to through myself

00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:25.260
in something in which I'm lost.

00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:34.600
Teaching in jail is my main fun
and my main hobby and it's absurd.

00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:41.320
I know on Monday when I'll be
there, in this place that nobody

00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:45.400
in the world would like to stay in,

00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:47.860
I will ask myself again
what I'm doing here,

00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:50.780
what the hell am I doing here?

00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:53.940
And I will do.

00:54:55.500 --> 00:55:01.570
So, writing is another way of
consuming, wasting yourself,

00:55:01.570 --> 00:55:10.800
staying stupidly still at the table

00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:19.320
or doing nothing actually
except playing with words,

00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:27.780
from an ethical point of view I
think it's quite understandable.

00:55:35.070 --> 00:55:44.500
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE MEMBER: I have a
question about the character

00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:52.350
that narrates [inaudible] because
obviously it's you, from some point

00:55:52.350 --> 00:56:00.640
of view, he has your
experience from school, your job,

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:08.600
but sometimes it feels like it's
not, like it's fiction of course,

00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:10.890
so the narration is unsupervised.

00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:15.180
So I know I shouldn't ask this to
you, but to what point it's you?

00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:16.600
And to what point it's not?

00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:20.490
If you could tell me [inaudible]
leave it to me of course.

00:56:20.490 --> 00:56:23.120
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: Well,
in a word that is not me.

00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:29.390
That's very simple but this
voice is built to use a large,

00:56:29.390 --> 00:56:32.580
huge chunks of my experience,
myself, but as a literary creature,

00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:37.240 position:56%
this narrator couldn't be exactly
like me because I needed to have ...

00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:42.270 position:56%
First it's a contrast with the
other let's say the co-protagonists,

00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:48.180
the main character of the book
is my schoolmate Arbus so I had

00:56:48.180 --> 00:56:55.360 position:56%
to make Arbus, well Arbus was really
clever and I could not be so clever

00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:59.730
as a character, so I
think I am more clever

00:56:59.730 --> 00:57:03.670
than the narrator of the book.

00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:05.390
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE MEMBER: You
are certainly less stupid.

00:57:05.390 --> 00:57:10.850
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: I'm
not better but this ...

00:57:10.850 --> 00:57:16.950
The problem is that I don't
know who I am so I cannot say

00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:19.950
that it's exactly me or not.

00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:22.870
I exaggerated some tendencies.

00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:27.170
For instance, in the book for
instance I say that I always cry

00:57:27.170 --> 00:57:30.890
and it's true, I cried
quite often, not always.

00:57:30.890 --> 00:57:37.830
This character cries, is never
able to cope with reality, never.

00:57:37.830 --> 00:57:42.770
I'm able 50/50, always.

00:57:42.770 --> 00:57:45.250
It's what I call intensification.

00:57:45.250 --> 00:57:48.720
I don't know if it's the word with
that sense or means [crosstalk]

00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:50.400
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Magnification.

00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:56.830
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: It's usually
what poetry do with reality

00:57:56.830 --> 00:58:05.680
to make it deeper, stronger,
more touching, more something.

00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:09.920 position:56%
Then they're bigger than reality,
usually you say bigger than reality.

00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:13.410
So, I think that in the
narrative way you need the same,

00:58:13.410 --> 00:58:18.650
so you have to do things
bigger or weaker than reality.

00:58:18.650 --> 00:58:25.960
Anyway, reality, you cannot use it
because you don't know what it is

00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:33.760
and if you are linked forever
just to the reproduction

00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:37.340
of reality, it's strangling-

00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:38.640
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Suffocating.

00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:39.940
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI:
-suffocating for writers.

00:58:39.940 --> 00:58:46.420
I must tell you one thing
that surprised me a lot.

00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:55.460
The real person who's behind
the character of Arbus

00:58:55.460 --> 00:59:00.490
after I published the book,
reappeared after 30 years

00:59:00.490 --> 00:59:04.040
or 40 years in my life,
he liked the book.

00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:12.420
He liked the fact that I used him
as a sort of model for a character,

00:59:12.420 --> 00:59:16.080
many things which were
completely invented,

00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:21.880
and the part invented was quite
heavy for a real person to accept,

00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:26.010
and he accepted it, he liked
it, he liked this joke,

00:59:26.010 --> 00:59:32.910
this playing with personality, or
individuality, so he's a genius.

00:59:32.910 --> 00:59:38.670
Even in the book, I tell you that
Arbus was a genius and I can,

00:59:38.670 --> 00:59:43.190 position:56%
I have to confirm that the real
Arbus is a genius because he's ready

00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:50.260
to be used by the play
of life and literature.

00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:55.440 position:56%
So he's really an open-minded person
because he didn't defend himself,

00:59:55.440 --> 01:00:00.210
say I didn't do that, I
didn't do that, and different.

01:00:00.210 --> 01:00:05.850
The same thing I did
with me, I used myself,

01:00:05.850 --> 01:00:10.120
I used my body and memory and soul.

01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:16.060
I don't have any respect for
life I must tell you that.

01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:22.310
I like life, I like the
way of transforming,

01:00:22.310 --> 01:00:27.780
that's why I like mythology in
which you change, you're a girl

01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:32.010
and you become a tree,
or things like this.

01:00:32.010 --> 01:00:33.310
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: A goddess.

01:00:33.310 --> 01:00:38.560
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: You can become
an animal or my favorite character,

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:42.970
Teresi, you can be
both man and woman.

01:00:42.970 --> 01:00:45.510
That's fantastic.

01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:49.380
I would like very much
to have this privilege

01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:52.360
but I'm confined in my body.

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:54.440
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: So we
would have needed three

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:59.310
or four hours for what
I had in mind.

01:00:59.310 --> 01:01:01.650
I thought we had plenty more time.

01:01:01.650 --> 01:01:04.440
One hour looks like a
lot of time but then

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:08.450
when you actually use
it, it's not enough.

01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:13.920
I think we have to stop here also
take my friends the technicians

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:18.280
above who need to stop
and get going.

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:23.940
But, thank you very much and I hope
you all enjoyed this opportunity

01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:26.370
and thank you for being here.

01:01:26.370 --> 01:01:28.930
&gt;&gt; EDOARDO ALBINATI: Thank you.

01:01:28.930 --> 01:01:30.230
[applause]

01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:33.490

of the Library of Congress.
