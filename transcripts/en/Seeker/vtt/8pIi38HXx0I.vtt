Here on Earth, radio waves help us communicate
with one another. But in deep space, they

00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:08.450
might be able to help us find the Universe’s
missing matter.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.959
Hey guys! Amy with you on DNews today.

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:18.270
There’re a lot of pretty insane things happening
in space all the time, but perhaps none are

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.220
so mysterious as fast radio bursts. FRBs are
immensely powerful events that can put out

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.910
as much energy as our Sun can in 10,000 years.
But they show up randomly and last just milliseconds,

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.480
making them really hard to measure or follow
up on. Scientists have only positively identified

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.040
sixteen FRBs in history. And further complicating
our attempts to understand them, FRBs are

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.940
rarely if ever observed in real time. For
the most part, they’re discovered months

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.300
or even years after they occur by astronomers
combing through archived data.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.230
But trust eager scientists to devise a way
to learn about these mysterious events. In

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.649
an attempt to catch an FRB before it’s gone,
a team of international astronomers led by

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.490
E. F. Keane set up an early warning system.
If one telescope receives a signal consistent

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.770
with an FRB, it alerts other scientists at
other participating observatories so they

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:10.290
can quickly slew their dishes to look in the
area of the sky the signal was first heard.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.760
And it worked! On April 18, 2015, the 64-meter
Parkes Radio Telescope in Australia detected

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:23.240
an FRB flash appropriately named FRB 150418.
The early warning system notified the collaborating

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.470
astronomers who got a second telescope in
Australia and a third in Hawaii looking in

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.820
the right part of the sky. Visible light imaging
found the FRB came from an elliptical galaxy.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.580
Spectral analysis helped them determine that
galaxy is 6 billion light-years away, an insane

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.960
halfway across the visible Universe!

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.259
So here’s where it gets interesting. Based
on the energy output of FRBs, astronomers

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.520
assumed they were produced when stars formed.
But elliptical galaxies are old and don’t

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.010
have a lot of active star formation, and the
event lasted longer than typical stellar formation.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.520
So they concluded that this FRB couldn’t
be the result of the birth of a star.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.020
Instead, it’s more likely that the burst
was caused by a pair of coalescing neutron

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.420
stars, the superdense remains of exploded
stars merging together to form a black hole.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.700
This is an incredibly powerful and violent
event that releases a lot of energy in a short

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.010
burst that would last milliseconds. This is
consistent with an FRB.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.500
But the story gets even better and has to
do with finding missing matter in the universe.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.310
The total mass/energy makeup of the Universe
can be roughly divided into three components:

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.920
dark energy makes up about 70 percent, dark
matter about 25 percent, and normal matter

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.761
the remaining 5. The problem is that we only
see half the normal matter; the rest is the

00:02:35.761 --> 00:02:41.510
hard to detect gas between galaxies. But this
FRB helped us find that missing matter.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.960
Radio waves traveling through the Universe
are dispersed as they pass through all the

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.220
gas and dust distributed through space, and
dispersion depends on what the radio waves

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.200
are passing through. So measuring the way
the radio waves from this FRB were altered

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.569
as they traveled through space AND knowing
how far they traveled, astronomers can determine

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.610
the Universe's makeup, including that missing
matter.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.120
Scientists observed the radio waves produced
from the FRB passed through something that

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.750
changed them in a way that was measurable,
and that something turned out to be the missing

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:09.860
matter.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.050
Super neat, eh? Well, some astronomers don’t
think so. A paper has come out since this

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.550
initial study saying that Keane’s team may
have jumped the gun on their FRB conclusion.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.989
The rebuttal paper from P. K. G. Williams
and E. Berger looks at the lingering radio

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.800
luminosity of the host galaxy and concludes
the signal is consistent with an active galactic

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.280
nucleus, not an FRB. Basically that would
mean the location and distance of the observed

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.620
event couldn’t be used to measure the composition
of the universe.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.110
So that means we kinda have to come to everyone’s
favourite conclusion: more research is needed!

But either way, how exactly did astronomers

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.310
find these fast radio bursts in the first
place? Laci has some more on these cosmic

00:03:47.310 --> 00:04:05.099
phenomena in this 
episode right here:

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.310
So what do you guys think: Is this a fast
radio burst, an active galactic nucleus, or

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.720
aliens? Let us know in the comments below
