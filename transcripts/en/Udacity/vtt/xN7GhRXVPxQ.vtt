00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Well, let's see. V² = V₀ or 5² + 2 times our acceleration, which is 10---g,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
times Δx, which is 57 meters.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I get that V² is equal to 1165, and the unit there will actually be m²/s².

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
When I take the square root, I find the velocity is 34.1 m/s.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Let's review the strategy here--understand the problem,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
identify our variables, first we identify which were given to us

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and we have to be careful to recognize the acceleration was given to us,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
identify what's being asked. Do we know that these were the four variables in question?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Find the corresponding equation--well, this one uses those four variables.

00:00:39.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And plug and chug. Not too bad. Let's do another practice question.
