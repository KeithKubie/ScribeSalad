TIMOTHY JORDAN: It
goes all the way to 11.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:11.960
That's great.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.400
So I'm here with
David Singleton,

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.192
VP of Engineering
for Android Wear,

00:00:15.192 --> 00:00:17.150
and he's going to catch
us up on all the latest

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.535
things with Android Wear.

00:00:18.535 --> 00:00:19.910
DAVID SINGLETON:
Thanks, Timothy.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.320
Yeah, so it's great to be
back here again at Google

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.065
I/O in the wonderful sunshine.

00:00:24.065 --> 00:00:25.190
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Every year.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.710
DAVID SINGLETON: Every
year, every year it's sunny.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.660
So what's new with Android Wear?

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.220
Earlier this year, we
launched Android Wear 2.0,

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.450
which is our biggest update to
the platform since we launched,

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.540
all the way back at
Google I/O in 2014.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.250
And with that update,
we were really

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.336
focused on making
some of the things

00:00:42.336 --> 00:00:44.210
that we see people do
most with their watches

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.720
better and faster.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.390
So we start with watch faces.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.760
Obviously, we all love
to have watch faces that

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.542
express our style.

00:00:51.542 --> 00:00:53.000
But actually, what
we're finding is

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.850
that people love to have
information that really matters

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.250
to them, right there at a
glance throughout the day.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.620
So we made it possible
for developers

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.440
to put data from their
apps onto any watch face

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.670
that the user might choose.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.846
And for users, that's
really powerful because it

00:01:06.846 --> 00:01:09.320
means you can have a watch
face that matches your style,

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.770
but has that information
from the apps that you love.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.260
We made major updates
to the system UI,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.520
to make things like messaging
much more fluid and fast.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.490
And then finally, we completely
revamped the fitness experience

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.740
with Android Wear 2.0.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.965
So with 2.0 having come
out earlier this year, what

00:01:27.965 --> 00:01:31.400
we are talking about I/O this
year is a lot of new stuff

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.110
that we're building
for developers.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.420
And during the keynote, we
shared some of the momentum

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.090
that we're seeing for Android
Wear in the category, which

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.280
we're really excited about.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.000
We shared during the
keynote that we now

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.639
will see 24 brands right now
that have Android Wear watches.

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:47.930
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's awesome.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.040
DAVID SINGLETON: And we didn't
say this in the keynote,

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.790
but that means
there are actually

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.920
46 different Android
Wear watches you

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.160
can choose from right now.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.770
And right from the
beginning, we felt

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.900
like it's really
important for a product

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.810
that you wear right on
your body to be somewhere

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.030
that you can express your
personal style and passion.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.340
And so having that choice
of devices, we think,

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.600
is a tremendous
testament to that.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.500
Some of the ones I'm
most excited about,

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.510
Tag Heuer just launched their
second generation product

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.910
which is called the
Tag Heuer Modular 45.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.410
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I haven't
seen one yet, is it amazing?

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.993
DAVID SINGLETON: So you should
take yourself into our sandbox,

00:02:20.993 --> 00:02:22.262
you can see.

00:02:22.262 --> 00:02:23.720
The best thing with
this product is

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.940
there are all kinds
of variations.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.030
You can swap out everything
from the bracelet

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.190
to the little horns to
the bezel on the watch,

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.950
and really create a look
that's very personal to you.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.450
And it also has
watch faces that are

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.730
personally customizable
to match all of that.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.630
We're also working with some
new partners for the first time

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:42.350
this year.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.830
So Movado, earlier in the
year, announced their product,

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.370
and it's really exciting to see
the kind of minimalist design

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.100
that they bring to their watch.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.500
And then some of our
other fashion partners,

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.010
like Michael Kors, for instance,
have updated their lineup

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.460
with a new product called the
Michael Kors Access Grayson,

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.550
and one called Sophie,
which you can see inside,

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.120
which is a really nice, small
watch, which I'm really excited

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.480
will take the product forward
for women in particular.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.480
So we're seeing this
really tremendous momentum.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.520
And actually, that began
before Android Wear 2.0.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.425
So when we look at our
new device activations

00:03:20.425 --> 00:03:21.800
for the holiday
season last year,

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.280
we actually saw 72%
growth on the year before.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.070
And with Wear 2.0 coming
and all those new devices,

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.290
we're really excited that
that momentum will continue

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.720
through this year and beyond.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.360
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.940
Let's talk a little
bit about fitness.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.731
It's one of the areas
that I'm most excited

00:03:35.731 --> 00:03:38.090
about with smart watches
in general, right.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.790
What are some of the new
devices and some of the features

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.582
there that you see users
really engaging with?

00:03:43.582 --> 00:03:45.540
DAVID SINGLETON: Yeah,
thanks for the question.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.331
One of the things that
we did with Wear 2.0

00:03:47.331 --> 00:03:50.300
was completely revamp
the fitness experience.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.219
And one of the things
that we really see

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:54.260
is that what people want
to do with their watches

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.590
fall into two buckets, two
distinct kinds of use case.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.020
So one is I'm actually
like, working out right now,

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.130
and I want to track
it right on my wrist.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.420
So we call that fit active mode.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.170
You can start fit activity,
you can use all the sensors

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.070
on the product--

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.530
maybe you're
running or cycling--

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.130
to see exactly how hard you're
working, use your heart rate,

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.550
compute things like your
distance and calories burned.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:21.740
The other kind of
experience is just

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.350
using the product to set some
goals that matter to you.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.820
Maybe I just want
to be more active

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.600
and I want to be active
perhaps for one hour every day.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.970
Set that goal and then
just go and live your life.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.440
The watch automatically
keeps track of your movement,

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.530
so we can see how many
minutes of the day

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.150
you really were active.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.200
And by seeing that at a glance
on any of those watch faces,

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.350
it really helps me be more
active through the day.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.427
And you'll see that right there
on the watch I'm wearing now.

00:04:47.427 --> 00:04:49.010
So we find that
tremendously powerful.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.750
But also, smart watches with
beautiful and vibrant screens,

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.530
like Android Wear devices, are
a great place to coach the user.

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.290
And so with the update
that we recently launched,

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.990
we introduced challenges,
where you can do things

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.710
like sit-ups and push-ups.

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.735
And the watch will actually
show you exactly how to do them.

00:05:07.735 --> 00:05:09.610
And then it will use
the sensors in the watch

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.710
to see how many you did
and are you doing them

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:12.982
with the correct form.

00:05:12.982 --> 00:05:15.190
And that's really cool,
because it means that there's

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.023
kind of no cheating.

00:05:16.023 --> 00:05:17.730
You can't say, yeah
I did my push-ups.

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.380
It is actually going
to count them for you.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.770
And you're going to
do more every day.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.330
And it really helps
keep you motivated.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.440
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's awesome.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.920
DAVID SINGLETON:
I'd love to tell you

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.840
a bit about what we
have new for developers

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.730
that we're talking
about at I/O this year.

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.740
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I was
going to ask that next.

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.760
DAVID SINGLETON: So we're really
excited to build on the things

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.240
that we're seeing developers
do with the Wear 2.0 platform.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.620
And in particular, let's
talk about watch faces.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.700
So I already mentioned that
we have the Complications

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.970
API that lets your app put
data on any watch face.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.449
But if we turned it around
to the watch face developers,

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:49.990
they can take those
data and actually

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.650
render them in any format
that fits the aesthetic style

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:54.420
of the watch face.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.250
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Now that's cool.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:55.810
DAVID SINGLETON:
And that is cool,

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.630
because it means that you can
have a watch face that really

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:03.070
represents the particular
visual graphic design,

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.920
or whatever it is that
you really care about.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.540
But some of our
watch face developers

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.840
have told us that they actually
find it quite challenging

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.820
to take all of the
different kinds of data

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.610
that apps could provide and
render them in an enchanting

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.260
fashion for their users.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:18.640
So we're making this easier.

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.530
We are launching
several things here

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.590
at Google I/O that mean that,
if you a watch face developer

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.750
and you're dealing with
this data coming from apps,

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.480
you can render it really
easily in an enchanting form.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.850
So one is a text
rendering system

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:35.820
that allows you to fit text into
any size region on the screen,

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.195
and it will
automatically resize.

00:06:37.195 --> 00:06:38.830
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's
one of those things that's

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.930
not as trivial as you
would think it would be.

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.180
DAVID SINGLETON: That's right.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.770
It actually took a lot of work
to make this work really well.

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:45.790
And then beyond that,
we have something

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:47.310
called complication drawable.

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.570
And that means that the
system will actually

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.180
take care of rendering the
complication data right

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.230
where you tell us.

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:56.170
And then we provide some APIs
that allow you to style it,

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:59.854
so it can still fit with the
visual flow of your watch face.

00:06:59.854 --> 00:07:01.270
And then beyond
watch faces, we're

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:04.600
also taking a lot of
the work that we've

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.630
done to build UI components
and going through the process

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:08.680
of open sourcing it.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.344
So it will be able
to be evolved faster

00:07:11.344 --> 00:07:13.510
and you'll also be able to
understand exactly how it

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:14.949
works as a developer.

00:07:14.949 --> 00:07:16.240
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It's very cool.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.280
All right, so what are
some good next steps?

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.809
What are some things that
developers can play with today?

00:07:20.809 --> 00:07:22.600
DAVID SINGLETON: So
today, you can go ahead

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.980
to the Android Wear website
and you can download the SDK.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.800
You can try out all of the
new APIs I just talked about.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.990
They are live on
GitHub right now, or as

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:34.040
of four minutes from now.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.150
