00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.450
In this lesson, you'll create a menu
app, using the Flask framework.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.029
I will start by showing you the basic
components of a Flask application,

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.860
with a simple hello world program,
which you will then create on your own.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.930
Then we will connect to our database via
SQL Alchemy to view all of the items in

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:16.640
each restaurant menu.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.900
Next, you will learn about templates,
and

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.270
how they allow you to write HTML code,
separately from Python code.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.670
Keeping your application more organized.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.540
After that,

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.380
I will introduce a special function
in Flask called url_for, which builds

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.670
the URLs that you will use to navigate
through your new Flask application.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.670
We will then create forms to
capture data from users, and

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.010
use message flashing to notify the user
each time they successfully change

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.000
information in the database.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.360
I will discuss a way to use
flash to add the option to

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.310
send JSON messages instead of HTML.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.310
And finally, take some time to
style our app with some CSS.
