I think the world would end if leaving
 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.980
I think the world would end if leaving
aside all these other catastrophes and

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990
aside all these other catastrophes and
 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.509
aside all these other catastrophes and
and leaving aside the possibility that

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519
and leaving aside the possibility that
 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:15.680
and leaving aside the possibility that
they could completely destroy earth

they could completely destroy earth
 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.439
they could completely destroy earth
which is not clear I think that the the

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449
which is not clear I think that the the
 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.740
which is not clear I think that the the
real end of earth will take place when

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750
real end of earth will take place when
 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.830

our orbit would be inside of that star

so I think the ultimate end of the earth

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630
so I think the ultimate end of the earth
 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.340
so I think the ultimate end of the earth
is going to be when the Sun expands to a

drag will cause the orbit of Earth to

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850
drag will cause the orbit of Earth to
 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.580
drag will cause the orbit of Earth to
decay much like an artificial satellite

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590
decay much like an artificial satellite
 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.840

approximately 5.4 billion more years as

approximately 5.4 billion more years as
 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.100
approximately 5.4 billion more years as
a main sequence star then a few hundred

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110
a main sequence star then a few hundred
 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.650
a main sequence star then a few hundred
million years beyond that so i would say

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660
million years beyond that so i would say
 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.520
million years beyond that so i would say
in roughly six six billion years from

in roughly six six billion years from
 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.370

now the inner planet should be engulfed

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380
now the inner planet should be engulfed
 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.199
now the inner planet should be engulfed
by the red giant Sun but by then

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209
by the red giant Sun but by then
 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.140

presumably advanced life here on earth

presumably advanced life here on earth
 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.900
presumably advanced life here on earth
will have colonized other worlds and so

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910
will have colonized other worlds and so
 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.030
will have colonized other worlds and so
we don't worry about it but but I think

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040
we don't worry about it but but I think
 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.070
we don't worry about it but but I think
that's the I think that's the perhaps

the best answer to your question is that

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849
the best answer to your question is that
 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:46.789
the best answer to your question is that
eventually it's got to happen the Sun

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799
eventually it's got to happen the Sun
 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.190
eventually it's got to happen the Sun
will become a red giant star and the

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200
will become a red giant star and the
 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.370
will become a red giant star and the
inner planets will then decay and and

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380
inner planets will then decay and and
 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.030
inner planets will then decay and and
burn up inside the Sun vaporize and then

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040
burn up inside the Sun vaporize and then
 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.979
burn up inside the Sun vaporize and then
Jupiter will start to accumulate mass

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989
Jupiter will start to accumulate mass
 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.410
Jupiter will start to accumulate mass
and if Jupiter accumulates more hydrogen

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420
and if Jupiter accumulates more hydrogen
 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.960
and if Jupiter accumulates more hydrogen
rich gas then it's then its present mass

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970
rich gas then it's then its present mass
 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.300
rich gas then it's then its present mass
its present mass is one one-thousandth

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310
its present mass is one one-thousandth
 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.120
its present mass is one one-thousandth
the sun's mass if Jupiter accretes about

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130
the sun's mass if Jupiter accretes about
 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.699
the sun's mass if Jupiter accretes about
ten others say roughly it reaches ten

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709
ten others say roughly it reaches ten
 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.890
ten others say roughly it reaches ten
times its present mass and it could do

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900
times its present mass and it could do
 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.800
times its present mass and it could do
this by by sweeping up solar gas as it

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810
this by by sweeping up solar gas as it
 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.229
this by by sweeping up solar gas as it
orbits the Sun with the future the

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239
orbits the Sun with the future the
 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.360
orbits the Sun with the future the
future resident giant Sun it could

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370
future resident giant Sun it could
 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.379
future resident giant Sun it could
undergo a thermonuclear ignition and

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:26.389
undergo a thermonuclear ignition and
 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:29.059
undergo a thermonuclear ignition and
become a star and so you'd have the Sun

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069
become a star and so you'd have the Sun
 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.759
become a star and so you'd have the Sun
and Jupiter as a binary system but this

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769
and Jupiter as a binary system but this
 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.949
and Jupiter as a binary system but this
is of course something that is billions

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959
is of course something that is billions
 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.980
is of course something that is billions
of years into the future
