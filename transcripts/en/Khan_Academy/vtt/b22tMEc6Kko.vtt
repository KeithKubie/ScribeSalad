00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.900
So we need to figure out
what 46 plus 43 is.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.800
Let me write it down again
and I'll write it like

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.220
this: 46 plus 43.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.770
What we do here is we just first
look at the ones place.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.600
We literally have 6 ones plus 3
ones, or you could say 6 and

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.400
3, and 6 plus 3 is just 9.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.660
6 plus 3 is 9, so
we have 9 ones.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.990
And then you go to the tens
place, and there's two ways to

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.570
think about it.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.260
You could view this as 4 plus
4 is equal to 8, but really,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.655
the reality of what we're doing
since we're operating in

00:00:36.655 --> 00:00:41.370
the tens place, this is really
40 plus 40 is equal to 80.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.650
And we could do the same
problem expanded out.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.560
This is the same thing
as 40 plus 6.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.180
We've seen this before, right?

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.420
That's what 46 is.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.650
And then 43 is the same
thing as 40 plus 3.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.690
We've expanded these
out before.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.290
And so when you add them,
when you add a 6 plus a

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.556
3, you get a 9.

00:01:05.556 --> 00:01:11.040
When you add a 40 plus
a 40, you get an 80.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.740
So you get 80 plus
9, which is 89.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.200
And the whole reason why I did
this is I wanted to show you

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.790
that when you're adding 4's in
the tens place, you're really

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:20.990
adding 40's.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.800
The fact that it's in the tens
place represents-- or the fact

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.890
that the 4 is in the tens
place shows that

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:26.840
it represents 40.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.890
The fact that the 8's there
shows that it represents 80.
