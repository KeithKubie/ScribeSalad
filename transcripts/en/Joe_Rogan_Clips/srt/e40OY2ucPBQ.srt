1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,460
The Joe Rogan experience

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,580
plan on having any debates with
people that oppose these ideas.

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:12,240
Um, well it was interesting on
your very show, Joe to yeah,

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,510
to have the debate that
involved, uh, Michael Shermer,

5
00:00:15,511 --> 00:00:19,290
who's the editor of the
skeptic magazine and, um,

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,710
some colleague of his who came in on
line who I got a bit annoyed with,

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,820
um, and, um, myself and, uh,
my great friend and colleague,

8
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:33,250
the genius, Randall
Carlson, uh, and, and, um,

9
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:37,620
I felt that that was a very useful debate.
Um,

10
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:42,060
I felt that it's possibly the first
time that those of us on the alternative

11
00:00:42,061 --> 00:00:46,020
side of the argument about history where
we're given an opportunity really to

12
00:00:46,021 --> 00:00:50,730
put our evidence forward and, and
to confront so-called skeptics. Uh,

13
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,800
well, it's so cold. That's
what he calls himself,

14
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,830
Michael Shermer with this evidence. And
you are, obviously I'm biased, but I,

15
00:00:57,831 --> 00:01:02,670
I don't feel that he fielded
the situation particularly well.

16
00:01:02,671 --> 00:01:06,360
I don't think mainstream archeology
came out of that looking really good.

17
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,830
I think it came out of that looking rather
ignorant and uh, and, and uninformed,

18
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:15,990
uh, and, and a man like Michael
Shermer who is a professional skeptic,

19
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:20,580
uh, cannot begin to match the knowledge
of a man like Randall Carlson who has

20
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:25,581
devoted his whole life to walking the
walk of the geology of the end of the ice

21
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:30,030
age in, in, in North America. And
that showed on, on, on that debate.

22
00:01:30,031 --> 00:01:32,700
So I think the debate was worth doing a,

23
00:01:32,701 --> 00:01:37,320
I think it showed that the alternative
side isn't just wishy washy stuff out

24
00:01:37,321 --> 00:01:40,320
there on the fringes of things that there
are those of us working in this field

25
00:01:40,321 --> 00:01:43,470
who are using really solid
information and who are,

26
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,900
who our project is to rewrite history.

27
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,660
And we're not going to do
that with slight information.

28
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:53,320
It has to be solid information. I think
we had the opportunity on your show to,

29
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,250
to say that, that, that
solid information is there.

30
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,580
I'm not claiming it was a complete
victory for the alternative side.

31
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,480
Michael Shermer is a smart guy and he
put forward some good arguments to,

32
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,180
and there were constructive
aspects of that debate, which I,

33
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,090
which I appreciate it.

34
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:10,890
I'd like to see much more engagement
and much more positive approach.

35
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,740
I wish the skeptics welcome
to their skepticism,

36
00:02:13,741 --> 00:02:18,000
but I wish they'd be less hateful,
less less full of derision, less,

37
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:21,680
less despising. Well, there's sort
of defensive with their ideas and,

38
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:25,770
and so and so defensive with their
ideas when the possibility is there for,

39
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,770
for a constructive debate.
You know,

40
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,510
what's interesting to me is that as this
evidence piles up and it seems to be

41
00:02:33,511 --> 00:02:36,870
continuing to pile up as more like the,
the,

42
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,770
these impact sites and more of this,
uh,

43
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,190
ancient civilization
material gets unearthed.

44
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,840
It's almost insurmountable.

45
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,410
Yeah. It's almost, and this is how,
this is how paradigms shift. I mean,

46
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:53,880
everybody's familiar with the concept
of a paradigm shift and there's a book

47
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,700
called the structure of scientific
revolutions by Thomas Kuhn,

48
00:02:56,701 --> 00:02:59,040
which outlines what a paradigm shift is,

49
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:04,050
where an established model in some
discipline of science that has been in

50
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:08,680
control of people's thinking for a very
long time suddenly falls apart and it

51
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:09,580
doesn't fall apart.

52
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:13,990
Suddenly what happens is that there's
an accumulation of evidence which that

53
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:17,080
model cannot explain.
That paradigm cannot explain it.

54
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:19,270
It seemed like a great
paradigm at one point,

55
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,020
but then it doesn't explain this
and then it doesn't explain like,

56
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:27,310
like the paradigm that says
that Megalithic architecture
is only 6,000 years old

57
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:31,210
and that the first megalithic architecture
was in Multa that can't explain the

58
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:36,100
massive megalithic site of good Beckley
Tepi in Turkey 5,500 years before that.

59
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,820
It's evidence like that the slow
accumulation of evidence that the existing

60
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:44,650
system cannot explain that adventure
will point no matter how strongly the

61
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:47,080
advocates of the existing
system hold on to it,

62
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,990
no matter how determined
they are in their defense,

63
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:54,220
no matter what dirty tricks they may
choose to deploy to undermine their

64
00:03:54,221 --> 00:03:55,840
opponents,
sooner or later,

65
00:03:55,841 --> 00:04:00,310
the evidence overwhelms them and the
paradigm goes down and you have a new way

66
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:03,670
of thinking and that that
is the story of science.

67
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:05,170
And it is a story that I think,

68
00:04:05,171 --> 00:04:09,100
I think we're at a tipping point in our
understanding of the past of the human

69
00:04:09,101 --> 00:04:12,640
species.
I am not saying that I am 100% right.

70
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:17,050
I believe that what I'm doing that's
worthwhile is I'm asking questions about

71
00:04:17,051 --> 00:04:19,030
the past that haven't been asked enough.

72
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,390
I'm putting archeologists on the spot and,

73
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,270
and demanding that they
explain themselves. I don't,

74
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,090
I don't claim that I am right.
I'm offering an alternative theory.

75
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,970
And my objective is to get
people to think for themselves,

76
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:35,560
to think about this stuff and not to
accept, uh, the voice of authority as the,

77
00:04:35,561 --> 00:04:39,940
as the sole, uh, medium of truth.
That's, that's what I've tried to do.

78
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,660
Have you had,
uh,

79
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,730
any archeologist review any of this
work and change their opinions? No.

80
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,310
No I haven't. But what I, what
I have found, uh, and I've,

81
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:56,290
I've found it interestingly during the
research trips for America before, uh,

82
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:00,670
is a younger generation of
archeologists who are in the field. Um,

83
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,810
and they are quite different from the
older generation of archaeologists who are

84
00:05:04,811 --> 00:05:07,510
running the whole scene
25 years ago or now.

85
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:09,220
We have a very different
younger generation,

86
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:13,450
the younger generation that has been
exposed to open minded thinking, um,

87
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,430
that has been exposed to the Internet.

88
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:19,150
That itself as part of the general
pattern of the younger generation is

89
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:23,020
suspicious of authority. I'm meeting
young archeologists on sites. For example,

90
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:26,050
I met a couple of really
amazing young minds, uh,

91
00:05:26,051 --> 00:05:30,700
on a site called Blackwater
draw, uh, in, um, uh,

92
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,690
Arizona, New Mexico, where, where
the one of the first Clovis sites,

93
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,050
the young archeologist I met there
were incredibly open minded and,

94
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,300
and really willing to
consider extraordinary
possibilities about the past and

95
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:46,810
privately admitted to me that
they'd read my books. Well,

96
00:05:46,811 --> 00:05:48,250
that's where I get the hope.

97
00:05:48,251 --> 00:05:51,160
I get the hope in this young generation
that is growing up with the Internet

98
00:05:51,161 --> 00:05:54,970
that does understand that there's a lot
more out there than just what they're

99
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:58,130
being taught in schools.
Yes. Yeah. Yes. This is this,

100
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:01,730
this is where the, where the hope
lies and it lies in, in every area.
