00:00:07.365 --> 00:00:08.346
MODERATOR: All right.

00:00:08.346 --> 00:00:09.970
And thank you all
for joining us today.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.920
We have a Talks at Google event
for you that's really special,

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.420
and is cool, cool, cool.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.110
We're here to celebrate
the fifth season

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.629
of the NBC show "Community."

00:00:18.629 --> 00:00:20.670
We're about in halfway
through the run right now.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.840
We picked it up
after the Olympics

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.820
and we're ready to
sprint to the end.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.140
So it is our true honor today
to have on co-showrunner Chris

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.640
McKenna.

00:00:32.945 --> 00:00:33.570
Who do we have?

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:42.647
We have Danny Pudi, Abed Nadir,
Alison Brie, Annie Edison,

00:00:42.647 --> 00:00:45.320
and it's dean-irific Jim Rash.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.894
All right, so I have a
few questions of my own.

00:00:51.894 --> 00:00:54.060
We'll have some questions
from the audience as well.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.040
And we actually recruited some
questions from human beings

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.095
across the United States.

00:00:58.095 --> 00:01:00.270
So we'll go from them as well.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.170
So to bring
everybody up to speed

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.620
we got season five this season.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:04.640
Harmon's back.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.010
McKenna's back.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.930
You filled all
Hall-H at Comic-Con.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.080
It was pretty amazing.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.930
So congrats on that.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.280
What were the early
days of shooting like?

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.330
Was it business as
usual, or something

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.960
completely different,
new sense of purpose?

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.630
CHRIS: How'd you guys feel?

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.760
ALISON: I felt like everything
felt back to normal.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.240
Whereas there may
or may not have

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.034
been a season where things
didn't feel as normal.

00:01:29.034 --> 00:01:29.700
DANNY: Gas leak?

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.210
ALISON: And then
suddenly it was like ah,

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.950
putting on that pair
of your favorite jeans.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:37.450
JIM: It was.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.324
ALISON: I don't know.

00:01:38.324 --> 00:01:40.055
I always have trouble
finding good jeans.

00:01:40.055 --> 00:01:40.735
JIM: Yeah, no.

00:01:40.735 --> 00:01:41.340
ALISON: That was not a good.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.881
JIM: Clearly.

00:01:41.881 --> 00:01:43.986
No, your analogy works.

00:01:43.986 --> 00:01:45.672
Feels like an old pair of jeans.

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:47.630
ALISON: That old pair of
jeans that still fits.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.546
DANNY: Good old Wranglers.

00:01:49.546 --> 00:01:51.290
All those Cavariccis.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.590
CHRIS: That haven't been
washed in at least 10 weeks

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.320
of preproduction.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.111
ALISON: Definitely.

00:01:55.111 --> 00:01:56.474
Definitely not.

00:01:56.474 --> 00:01:57.640
DANNY: They're funny though.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.530
Very funny jeans.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.990
CHRIS: Do you sleep
in them on the couch?

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.489
JIM: Yeah.

00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:02.900
ALISON: They small but
it's a familiar smell.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.572
It's a good smell.

00:02:04.572 --> 00:02:05.280
CHRIS: Well good.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.844
JIM: So the answer is yes.

00:02:07.844 --> 00:02:08.343
DANNY: Yes.

00:02:08.343 --> 00:02:09.229
Jean comfortable.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.270
I think it's comfortable.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.672
I think it felt good.

00:02:11.672 --> 00:02:13.380
I think as soon as we
had the first table

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.670
read we just felt like
oh, it was-- This is good.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.020
And it's also for
us too like we never

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.590
thought we'd have
a fifth season.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.760
So I mean to actually
have a fifth season be

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.017
like re-excited about
it was really cool.

00:02:24.017 --> 00:02:25.850
ALISON: I feel like
more than any other year

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.230
this year everyone felt relaxed.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.760
That's never been the case.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.330
The first year it's like
everyone's super excited,

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.850
because you're doing a show,
and then the second year it's

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.260
like, oh my god,
we made it back,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.093
and then the third year
was very tumultuous.

00:02:38.093 --> 00:02:41.230
You know, we've had such an up
and down ride the whole time,

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.260
and finally this
year I think, one,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.010
with us just having
peace of mind of like,

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.654
well anything could
happen and it's fine.

00:02:47.654 --> 00:02:48.154
CHRIS: Yeah.

00:02:48.154 --> 00:02:48.910
ALISON: You know?

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:49.782
CHRIS: You have to
because, you know

00:02:49.782 --> 00:02:51.530
we were taken off the schedules.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.320
There has always been
an ax hanging over

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.470
"Community"'s head.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.050
And in season three it
seemed to have come down

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.807
where we were taken
off the schedule.

00:03:00.807 --> 00:03:02.140
So we were just making episodes.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.973
We didn't think they
were ever going to air.

00:03:03.973 --> 00:03:05.640
ALISON: Just black
hole of episodes.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.990
CHRIS: And yeah, some of us
may have fell into the abyss.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.080
And it was probably
reflected in a lot

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.910
of the-- Stuff got
really dark that year.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.850
I love that season,
but we definitely

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.590
plumbed some dark
depths by the end.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.990
And then what do you know,
we came back on in March.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.650
And because guess what?

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.656
8 o'clock.

00:03:26.656 --> 00:03:28.460
That's a tough time period.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.790
Other shows, you know,
get beaten up there too.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.660
And so we were put
back to be pummeled on

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.370
by "Big Bang Theory,"
and we're still here.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.332
MODERATOR: That's cool.

00:03:37.332 --> 00:03:38.790
Was it difficult
to transition back

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.790
after being gone for a season
from my writing and showrunning

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:42.670
perspective Chris?

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:43.630
CHRIS: It was exciting.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.760
I would say, Harmon and I were
really excited to go back.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.730
We were really invigorated.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.300
We just wanted to get back to
basics with the characters,

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.610
and we were so happy there
were no curve-balls thrown

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.030
our way like, you
know, main actors

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.450
deciding that they were
going to leave the show.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.870
We were very excited, and
that disappeared very quickly.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.780
But unlike season three where
we were about to commit suicide,

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.380
as Alison said, you
just kinda go, look--

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.844
ALISON: We've been
through so much.

00:04:15.844 --> 00:04:17.260
CHRIS: We've been
through so much.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.399
Maybe we were just numb to
it, like an abused child.

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:20.810
We were just like, OK,
we'll deal with it.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.185
It was sad, but
we dealt with it.

00:04:22.185 --> 00:04:23.514
And I think I don't know.

00:04:23.514 --> 00:04:24.930
How do you guys
feel that we dealt

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.240
with what we had
to contend with?

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.950
ALISON: I like "Community"
addresses a lot of things.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.440
I feel like we just go after
them and then get rid of them.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.159
That sounded very bad.

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.950
DANNY: Yeah it did.

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.415
ALISON: But it's sort of
like rather than things that

00:04:41.415 --> 00:04:43.290
are going to hang on
for long periods of time

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.160
where people thought
cast members are leaving,

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.452
are they going to stretch it
out over the whole season,

00:04:49.452 --> 00:04:51.076
is it going to feel
like a weird thing,

00:04:51.076 --> 00:04:52.930
it's like no, let's
just address-- We

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:53.900
all know he's leaving.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.680
The audience knows he's leaving.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.364
Let's just address
that, talk about it.

00:04:58.364 --> 00:05:00.780
He's going to leave and then
life is going to go on after.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.919
CHRIS: We'll find someone else

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:03.460
ALISON: Yeah.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.290
We've moved on.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.980
CHRIS: Better and
smarter, and funnier.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.630
John Oliver.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.682
Jonathon Banks.

00:05:11.682 --> 00:05:13.890
No, so because there was
the idea of like, oh, do you

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:14.860
want to spread that out?

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.215
You know, if we
only get five do you

00:05:16.215 --> 00:05:17.210
want to spread that
over the full season?

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.090
I'm like, ugh, that's
just like having

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.470
your boyfriend is
broken up with you.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.540
ALISON: But he's still
living in your apartment.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.456
CHRIS: Hanging out, and
you know, occasionally

00:05:25.456 --> 00:05:27.890
like stopping by in the
middle of the night, and no.

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:32.045
JIM: Which it'd also be
that weird thing where

00:05:32.045 --> 00:05:33.495
you're justifying
why he's not there.

00:05:33.495 --> 00:05:34.036
ALISON: Yeah.

00:05:34.036 --> 00:05:35.070
JIM: He's on that trip.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.570
CHRIS: Yeah.

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.982
JIM: He'll be back in
about three to four weeks.

00:05:38.982 --> 00:05:41.610
CHRIS: That camping trip
he talked about, weirdly,

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.542
weirdly wedged into his
conversation last week.

00:05:44.542 --> 00:05:46.250
MODERATOR: Yeah, and
I guess to that end,

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.909
you know a lot has
been already said

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:50.450
in the press about the last day
of filming with Donald Glover

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.720
before he went off on
the childish tycoon,

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.230
but what I really
want to know what

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.700
were the days leading
up to the last day?

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.380
ALISON: Well, I mean I've said
this before because I actually

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.440
think it's funny that we shot
the episodes out of order.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:08.420
So like the days leading
up to his actual departure

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.300
were totally uneventful for him.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.050
We were shooting--

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.010
CHRIS: We were shooting
"Ass Crack Bandits," which

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:14.660
was technically 505,
our fifth episode.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:15.550
ALISON: So it was
like we did all--

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.091
I felt like everyone was very
emotional when we were shooting

00:06:18.091 --> 00:06:19.840
the scene with the
childish tycoon,

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.700
and he's going to
leave, and everyone's

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.300
like we're hugging him
goodbye, and it felt very real.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.714
And then the next
week we're like hey.

00:06:27.714 --> 00:06:31.180
CHRIS: It's the one with
the quarters in your butt.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.860
DANNY: That's very normal.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.090
CHRIS: I was there for
his very last shot,

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:38.196
and it was like 5:00 in
the morning on Saturday.

00:06:38.196 --> 00:06:40.570
And it was literally a shot
of Donald's butt bending over

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:41.376
[INAUDIBLE].

00:06:41.376 --> 00:06:42.538
Like perfect.

00:06:42.538 --> 00:06:43.246
DANNY: Symbolism.

00:06:43.246 --> 00:06:46.576
ALISON: He went out
the way he came in.

00:06:46.576 --> 00:06:47.450
JIM: Wait he came in?

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:49.392
ALISON: Oh, you
don't know the story

00:06:49.392 --> 00:06:50.600
about how Donald got the job?

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.225
DANNY: Tell us.

00:06:51.225 --> 00:06:52.800
Guys.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.824
JIM: So bookends, literally.

00:06:54.824 --> 00:06:56.490
MODERATOR: All right,
that's good stuff.

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:57.270
ALISON: Yep.

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:58.980
MODERATOR: Also looking at
season five, do any of you

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.610
have any particular
favorite story

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:03.080
lines that have
been done so far?

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.150
DANNY: I'm excited about the
episode that we have coming up.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.970
ALISON: Yes.

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.140
DANNY: We have an
episode where-- What can

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.080
I say about that one?

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.490
ALISON: Can he say what
we do in the episode?

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:13.975
CHRIS: Yeah.

00:07:13.975 --> 00:07:16.120
Yeah, I think that's
already out there, so yeah.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.550
JIM: Just keep whispering and--

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:18.460
DANNY: Because they
don't know what

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.100
we're talking
about that episode.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.766
JIM: Is it OK if we
talk about that one.

00:07:21.766 --> 00:07:24.720
CHRIS: And don't spoil
who's in the thing.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.360
DANNY: Oh, OK.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.110
OK.

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:27.569
Well, we have an
episode coming up.

00:07:27.569 --> 00:07:28.318
CHRIS: It's great.

00:07:28.318 --> 00:07:29.589
It's a great roommate episode.

00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:30.880
DANNY: It's a roommate episode.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:31.890
ALISON: Yeah, it's
this roommate episode.

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:33.370
DANNY: Based on Troy leaving.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.490
So we have to find
a new roommate.

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:36.510
Can I say that?

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:37.010
CHRIS: Yes.

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:37.780
Yeah sure.

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.405
ALISON: We have to
find a new roommate,

00:07:39.405 --> 00:07:42.060
and we're sort of vying for
our options of the roommate.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.720
But to settle the score--
To settle the score?

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.460
No.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.940
DANNY: To settle, well
to find a roommate--

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.830
ALISON: We play this
like VCR, this like--

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:53.290
DANNY: '80's
interactive VCR game.

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:54.400
ALISON: VCR, yeah.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.320
DANNY: So, it's really--

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.630
CHRIS: They get
a little into it.

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:01.830
And it's really confusing
and doesn't make any sense.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:04.890
ALISON: And it was so
confusing to shoot.

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:07.196
DANNY: Because we were
trying to establish rules.

00:08:07.196 --> 00:08:08.570
ALISON: And they
shot separately.

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.870
So we're all just looking at
like green X's on the screen,

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:15.930
and we're like coordinating,
jumping up, spinning around,

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.110
like shooting things.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:18.610
DANNY: Pulling
tokens, rolling dice.

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:20.655
ALISON: So, go token four!

00:08:20.655 --> 00:08:21.780
CHRIS: And the two people--

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:22.070
DANNY: Tornado.

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.570
Tornado!

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:23.972
ALISON: Tornado!

00:08:23.972 --> 00:08:24.930
I'm not going to do it.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:28.255
DANNY: Tornado!

00:08:28.255 --> 00:08:31.105
ALISON: Tornado!

00:08:31.105 --> 00:08:31.873
DANNY: We got it.

00:08:31.873 --> 00:08:32.539
We still got it.

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:34.593
We still got it Chris.

00:08:34.593 --> 00:08:37.890
CHRIS: Alison won and Jim
has to be your roommate now.

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:39.099
ALISON: Yay!

00:08:39.099 --> 00:08:40.265
CHRIS: It's a great episode.

00:08:40.265 --> 00:08:42.370
JIM: No, literally in real life.

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:44.665
ALISON: Oh.

00:08:44.665 --> 00:08:45.415
JIM: It was a pun.

00:08:45.415 --> 00:08:46.550
ALISON: That was a twist.

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:49.104
JIM: Like a meta real
life and art thing.

00:08:49.104 --> 00:08:50.270
Yeah, we're living together.

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:51.240
It's great.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:55.350
CHRIS: We have another episode
coming up where these three--

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:56.300
DANNY: Oh yeah.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:57.790
CHRIS: These three
make a discovery

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:00.530
and go on a little adventure,
or head up this adventure

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:01.030
together.

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:02.738
And I thought that
the way that the three

00:09:02.738 --> 00:09:04.910
of you, because each of
you, each of your characters

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:07.450
has a little bit of
insanity and take things

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:08.682
a little too seriously.

00:09:08.682 --> 00:09:09.640
DANNY: Thank you Chris.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.348
CHRIS: But that's
going to be the finale.

00:09:11.348 --> 00:09:14.970
We have a two part finale,
and they sort of head

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.257
the sort of Scooby
Doo mystery that they

00:09:17.257 --> 00:09:18.590
pull the rest of the group into.

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:19.960
DANNY: That episode
was really fun for us

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.890
because it was one of the few
times where all three of us

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:24.330
were paired together for
the whole like storyline.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:27.430
And it was fun watching
how crazy our energy was

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:29.140
in the scenes with
everyone else.

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:31.598
ALISON: Oh my god, and then
the other people would come in.

00:09:31.598 --> 00:09:34.332
We'd be like in a little
bottle like shooting stuff

00:09:34.332 --> 00:09:35.790
just the three of
us, and then we'd

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:37.010
bring in the rest of
the cast, and they'd all

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:38.724
be like you guys
gotta calm down.

00:09:38.724 --> 00:09:40.390
DANNY: What has been
going on this week?

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:41.350
And they're like no it's OK.

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:43.110
Rob, [INAUDIBLE] and
Chris said it's cool.

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:44.765
They said it's cool
to be this energetic.

00:09:44.765 --> 00:09:47.056
ALISON: We would jump and
down and yell our macho words

00:09:47.056 --> 00:09:49.610
to each other really loud
and then restart the scene,

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:51.375
and everyone was like
what are you doing?

00:09:51.375 --> 00:09:52.931
We've never done this here.

00:09:52.931 --> 00:09:53.680
CHRIS: It's great.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.890
We were just editing
that episode together,

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:58.737
and you guys come bursting
in, and are very excited

00:09:58.737 --> 00:10:00.570
and feeding off each
other, and it's insane.

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:01.420
It's great.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.490
ALISON: While also while
we were shooting it

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:04.620
we didn't really know
what we were shooting.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.170
So that added to
the manic energy.

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:10.410
The episodes were sort of being
written as we went and halfway

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:13.050
through we decided that one
was coming before the-- I

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:13.550
shouldn't.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:14.740
Chris'll say don't say that.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:15.670
CHRIS: No, no, no.

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:16.300
Oh, god.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:17.280
It's insane.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.025
We usually don't know
what's happening.

00:10:19.025 --> 00:10:21.440
ALISON: That was a
particularly interesting one

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.235
where you and Dan
were sort of on set

00:10:23.235 --> 00:10:25.612
being like here's
what's happening.

00:10:25.612 --> 00:10:26.970
We're like OK.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:29.350
CHRIS: We shot the second
part of the two part finale

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:30.740
before we shot the first part.

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:32.200
ALISON: But we didn't know
it was the second part.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:32.410
CHRIS: And we didn't
even know what

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:33.860
was happening in the first part.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.443
DANNY: So we knew
where we were going.

00:10:35.443 --> 00:10:37.350
We just didn't know why
we were going there.

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:38.850
CHRIS: I think the
theory was, look,

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:41.030
we know we're going to send
them on this adventure,

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:44.102
and we're not sure
how we set that up,

00:10:44.102 --> 00:10:45.810
and we'll just figure
that out because we

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:47.190
have to write the
second part of it.

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:48.900
You guys do code like
that all the time right?

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:49.400
DANNY: Yeah.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.010
This is Google.

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:52.865
It's the same thing.

00:10:52.865 --> 00:10:55.240
CHRIS: Yeah, we may have
written ourselves into a corner,

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:58.430
but I think it's going
to turn out pretty great.

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:00.875
DANNY: That's part of I think
the fun of our show too.

00:11:00.875 --> 00:11:03.249
CHRIS: What can we tell them
that maybe had some details?

00:11:03.249 --> 00:11:05.711
Tell them a little about
this week's episode?

00:11:05.711 --> 00:11:07.210
MODERATOR: Sure,
they saw a preview.

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:07.610
DANNY: Meow-Meow Beans.

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:10.300
CHRIS: Oh did you guys just
watch the Meow Meow Beans?

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.780
Things get a little weird.

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:16.010
ALISON: Someone will be
wearing a blousey shirt later.

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:19.540
CHRIS: Things descend
into "Logan's Run" because

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.230
of this social media
app where people

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:24.802
are rated either a five, a
four, a three, a two, or a one.

00:11:24.802 --> 00:11:26.510
ALISON: Everyone gets
to rate each other.

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:29.290
DANNY: There's a whole
hierarchy that's developed.

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:31.719
I love episodes like this
where we start a cold open

00:11:31.719 --> 00:11:34.010
and then you cut to, immediately
after the commercials,

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:36.925
the whole campus, everyone,
is immediately-- There's

00:11:36.925 --> 00:11:40.510
a new language, a new
culture, a new fashion.

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:43.370
I mean within three
minutes everything changes.

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:46.190
JIM: This school
changes on a dime.

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:48.009
New costume for me.

00:11:48.009 --> 00:11:48.800
Worlds are created.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.210
CHRIS: Classes, what classes?

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:50.790
JIM: Classes.

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:53.260
No.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.072
CHRIS: So this one it was weird.

00:11:55.072 --> 00:11:57.280
This was an experimental
one where we didn't come out

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.230
like in "Modern Warfare
Paintball" where we came out

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:00.060
of the cold open.

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:02.520
We thought oh, no, no, no,
we'll eventually get there,

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:06.334
and that was a much harsher,
and it was like, oh wait, no.

00:12:06.334 --> 00:12:08.250
It's so much better to
have like the cold open

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:10.395
then you go into lunacy.

00:12:10.395 --> 00:12:11.270
I think it works now.

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:13.490
We figured it out,
but for a little while

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:15.615
they were like, oh
man, did we break TV?

00:12:17.927 --> 00:12:19.760
It's definitely one of
my favorite episodes.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.510
DANNY: We were shooting
in the study room,

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:23.770
and they just kept
bringing in random props.

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:25.404
I don't know if you remember.

00:12:25.404 --> 00:12:26.320
CHRIS: The white room?

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.620
DANNY: Yeah, in the white room.

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:29.300
And just kept adding
things and being

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.400
like-- we were discovering
the environment

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.007
while we were shooting it.

00:12:33.007 --> 00:12:34.840
ALISON: It's a common
theme of how we shoot.

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:35.610
DANNY: People too.

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:39.720
And this episode has some of my
favorite guest star appearances

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.880
ever in our show.

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.730
CHRIS: Oh, we have--

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:44.360
DANNY: I won't tell them, but--

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.860
ALISON: "Tim and
Eric Awesome Show."

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:46.950
CHRIS: Tim and Eric are in it.

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:49.116
Mitch Hurwitz, the creator
of "Arrested Development"

00:12:49.116 --> 00:12:50.520
is in it, and hilarious.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.525
ALISON: Mitch Hurwitz is
so funny in this episode

00:12:53.525 --> 00:12:56.650
and was such a funny
guy all the time.

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:58.990
I feel like it was our
favorite week of shooting just

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:02.296
having Mitch around, and
everyone's like do things.

00:13:02.296 --> 00:13:03.960
Talk in front of us.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.410
And everyone was on good
behavior cause we're like

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:08.640
and whenever you're
making something else--

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:09.849
DANNY: Yeah, we're available.

00:13:09.849 --> 00:13:10.890
We're probably available.

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:11.840
ALISON: We act.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.006
CHRIS: Look at this episode.

00:13:13.006 --> 00:13:15.550
There's no way we're
getting a sixth season.

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:18.109
I mean people are wearing
bed sheets and it's nonsense.

00:13:18.109 --> 00:13:19.650
And the funny thing
with Mitch though

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:23.790
it was someone who had
run a show before--

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:26.060
ALISON: Was the most disruptive.

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:28.636
CHRIS: It was like
having a live animal on.

00:13:28.636 --> 00:13:30.730
He was like running around,
not saying his lines,

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:31.605
and being ridiculous.

00:13:31.605 --> 00:13:34.017
Luckily he had some of
the funniest ad libs.

00:13:34.017 --> 00:13:35.850
ALISON: Mitch, just say
it how it's written.

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:37.720
And he'd be like yeah,
yeah, and then he'd

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.500
just go do a monologue
of his own device.

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.250
CHRIS: Yeah, and then
Ken Jeong would just

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:44.310
be laughing hysterically
and break it every take.

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:46.060
DANNY: Ken cannot stop laughing.

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:47.240
That's right.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.240
CHRIS: That's why we're
a million dollars over.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.210
ALISON: But Ken is
having a great time.

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:54.105
DANNY: We do have a good time.

00:13:54.105 --> 00:13:55.730
MODERATOR: And of
course Nathan Fillion

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:57.370
made a pretty amazing guest.

00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:57.870
ALISON: Yes.

00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:59.610
I was actually-- I was
going to say-- Oh, that

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:00.388
was-- Never mind.

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:07.270
That was a fun episode to shoot.

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:07.800
Carry on.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.490
MODERATOR: All right.

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:11.865
So I'd like to shift a little
bit to the characterization

00:14:11.865 --> 00:14:14.400
and how things have
changed in this season.

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.140
So I'll start with you Danny.

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:21.200
So in last week's episode,
the "Bondage and Beta Male

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.400
Sexuality" Abed really had
some very pivotal scenes,

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.890
and so he got a lot stronger.

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:30.590
I wanted to say how did
you approach these scenes?

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:32.990
Is Abed more comfortable
being his true self

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:37.190
with this group of people, or
is this just how he really is?

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:39.282
CHRIS: And what
happened to your nose?

00:14:39.282 --> 00:14:40.240
DANNY: A lot of things.

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.320
I broke my nose this
season, and that

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.730
was the episode, this last
week, where I broke my nose.

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:49.440
So I don't know
if you could tell.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.175
ALISON: Only the episode
where you had the most to do.

00:14:52.175 --> 00:14:53.800
CHRIS: And the most
dramatic close-ups.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:54.350
DANNY: I break my nose.

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:55.891
They're like hey,
we need you back on

00:14:55.891 --> 00:14:57.370
set as I'm coming
from the doctor.

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:01.450
And they're like we want to
try this mask on your nose.

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:03.330
And I'm like I
just broke my nose.

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:05.371
They're like yeah, we want
to just see how this--

00:15:05.371 --> 00:15:07.000
ALISON: How this metal mask.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.595
DANNY: So we had to figure
out that kick-puncher mask,

00:15:09.595 --> 00:15:11.329
but I love this
episode because it

00:15:11.329 --> 00:15:13.620
was sort of like how are we
going to address not having

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:14.810
that Troy Abed dynamic.

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:16.637
And I think it was
kind of fun to just

00:15:16.637 --> 00:15:17.720
be paired up with someone.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.687
And Jonathon Banks is
very different, has

00:15:19.687 --> 00:15:20.770
a different sort of style.

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:22.530
And it was fun.

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:23.734
It felt kind of different.

00:15:23.734 --> 00:15:26.400
It was just a new thing that we,
we talked about this this year,

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.240
in terms of acting it
was like it was cool

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.615
this year because
we had a chance

00:15:29.615 --> 00:15:32.390
to do very different stuff
that we haven't really done.

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:33.650
We had two person scenes.

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:35.260
We had some more
slower paced scenes,

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:36.120
which is really interesting.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.536
JIM: I think from the very
beginning there was a decision,

00:15:38.536 --> 00:15:40.630
and it felt like you guys.

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:42.886
One it was the re-pilot
of it, but this evolution

00:15:42.886 --> 00:15:44.260
of all these guys,
because you're

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.480
dealing with the
loss of a friend,

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.000
and coming through
Jonathan Banks'

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.750
character, and this
new evolution of Abed.

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:52.680
And I think it was across the
board the mandate it felt like.

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.280
It was not just about
pairing other people up.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:59.260
It just felt like it was about
realizing that life moves on

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.080
and these same
people keep evolving.

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.810
And it's a great thing that
we've had with "Community"

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:05.580
because we don't know what's
coming down the pipeline.

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:08.110
We're able to like push
that story and just say,

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:09.850
well, this is what
happened last year,

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:11.350
and these are the ramifications.

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:13.090
I thought that was a nice thing.

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:15.960
But that particular
episode, when you watch it,

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.040
is such a nice
evolution of Abed.

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.700
DANNY: And I think
this year, in terms

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:22.860
of like-- I've said I think
Abed's changed and grown

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:25.842
the most this year than of all
the seasons, and some of it

00:16:25.842 --> 00:16:27.800
is because we had to deal
with certain changes.

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.760
But I think that was
kind of cool, because we

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:33.140
took some of those things that
were happening like, you know,

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:35.200
Pierce being gone
and Troy leaving,

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.570
and we just applied it, and
just see what else happens.

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:40.110
So I actually really liked it.

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:42.152
I thought it was really fun to
kind of have these two person

00:16:42.152 --> 00:16:43.735
scenes where these
two characters come

00:16:43.735 --> 00:16:45.420
from very different places.

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:45.920
Yeah.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:46.540
It was exciting.

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:47.240
CHRIS: You're
going to be excited

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.500
when you get stubbed
for an Emmy again.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:50.300
DANNY: Oh, yay!

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:51.350
ALISON: I'll be excited for you.

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.560
DANNY: That's OK.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.809
If we come back for a sixth
season that's [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:58.240
CHRIS: That's one of my
favorite episodes ever.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.330
I mean Danny, all
of you guys kill it.

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:05.442
That was just such a great-- you
front and center just bringing

00:17:05.442 --> 00:17:06.400
that character to life.

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:10.024
And it was one of
those things that

00:17:10.024 --> 00:17:11.727
were like you said
we're always trying--

00:17:11.727 --> 00:17:13.310
the most interesting
stuff on the show

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:16.960
always comes from dealing with
stuff that's actually happening

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.700
in the reality of the
show, and writing up to it,

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:21.589
and dealing with Troy's
loss, and not having

00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:23.130
to be this thing
that's haunting you,

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:24.510
but something we
just had to address.

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:25.926
And plus we had
this new character

00:17:25.926 --> 00:17:28.850
that we loved that we
will really just go, oh,

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:33.040
this guy is not going to be
buying any of Abed's bullshit.

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.065
So it was really fun.

00:17:34.065 --> 00:17:36.740
And "Community" is a
place for broken people,

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.110
and Hickey fits
right into that mold,

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:42.350
and that sort of like that
"Taxi" sensibility of people

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:45.650
who are still trying to figure
out life and their own lives,

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:48.130
and no matter how old they
are or how young they are.

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:50.950
I thought the two of you
coming together on that story

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:52.010
was really great.

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:53.843
MODERATOR: And we're
also seeing a much more

00:17:53.843 --> 00:17:54.995
grown up Annie this season.

00:17:54.995 --> 00:17:55.260
ALISON: Yeah.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:56.750
MODERATOR: So anything that we
should be on the lookout for?

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:58.430
ALISON: A lot of your pants.

00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:59.080
More pants.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.150
MODERATOR: More jeans?

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:03.040
ALISON: A lot of
people on Twitter

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.540
have been commenting
on these pants.

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:07.370
They're not going
anywhere people.

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:08.870
DANNY: Are they mad
about the pants?

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:10.880
ALISON: Some people are
mad about the pants.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.380
CHRIS: I can't
believe a "Community"

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.549
fan would have a
really intense--

00:18:14.549 --> 00:18:15.590
ALISON: A strong reaction

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:16.140
CHRIS: Reaction to something.

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:18.151
JIM: A visceral
reaction to your pants.

00:18:18.151 --> 00:18:18.650
ALISON: No.

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:19.150
It's great.

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:21.290
And that's something
that I had talked to Dan

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:23.160
a little bit about
before we started.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:27.310
And we talk about re-pilot and
the characters moving forward,

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:29.760
but also I think in
moving forward there

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:33.110
was a lot of grounding them
in sort of the stuff that

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:35.870
made them who they were
in our first season.

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:40.350
So I felt like over
the years there

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:43.090
was this departure from
the original like go-getter

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:45.430
Annie that was like
very determined,

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:49.280
and a hard worker, and
ambitious, and all that stuff.

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:52.040
And that had gotten muddled.

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:54.160
And this year we've
really returned to it,

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.970
and her being a sort of
moral center for the group,

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:59.270
but is crazy in that way.

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:01.460
That's her craziness.

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:04.280
Craziness.

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:05.860
It's coming out of me.

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:09.394
DANNY: [SHRIEKING]

00:19:09.394 --> 00:19:10.560
ALISON: But it's really fun.

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:11.560
I way prefer.

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:15.090
I just as much prefer
that side of her

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:18.139
because I think it gets
the other characters going.

00:19:18.139 --> 00:19:19.680
It's like a much
more interesting way

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.304
to interact with
characters rather than

00:19:21.304 --> 00:19:24.070
just like having a crush on
them or something like that.

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:29.330
It's back to like season one
when she and Jeff were working

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:32.630
for the newspaper, and she's
like I've got a major scoop.

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:35.360
I kind of like Annie in a
like detective position,

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:38.180
or that we're having
forensics, criminology.

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:40.310
I loved the "Ass
Crack Bandit" episode.

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:41.580
That was so fun to shoot.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:44.271
I just like that side of her.

00:19:44.271 --> 00:19:46.770
MODERATOR: And Jim, I guess we
have much more of the faculty

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:48.580
dynamic this season as well.

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:49.670
So what's that been like?

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:51.860
How have things been different
for the life of the dean?

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.484
JIM: Yeah, cause
we've had John Oliver,

00:19:53.484 --> 00:19:55.400
and then Professor
Hickey added, and then

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.556
obviously Jeff's evolution.

00:19:57.556 --> 00:19:58.310
It's been fun.

00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:01.680
I mean instantly it was fun just
because once again the dean is

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.340
not allowed to be
in a certain area.

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:05.690
So that established
very quickly that I

00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:07.530
wasn't allowed in
the teacher's lounge.

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:09.940
I probably helped them
get half of that stuff.

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:13.610
So I just liked that it was nice
because the dean just really

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:16.980
still loves a school that seems
to fight against him every step

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:21.280
of the way, you know because
his ideas are so horrible,

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:23.290
which makes sense.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:24.890
And again I think
that speaks more

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:29.020
to what's the evolution of Jeff,
which was so nice, to put him

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:31.400
in this position where
he's between his friends

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.710
and this new sort of
career that he's probably

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:37.130
fighting tooth and
nail to be a part of.

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:41.110
And obviously Hickey
is such a great sort

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:44.210
of roommate, if
you will, for that.

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:47.249
So again, it just sort of
fit the whole big picture.

00:20:47.249 --> 00:20:48.040
MODERATOR: Awesome.

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:48.539
Awesome.

00:20:48.539 --> 00:20:50.590
And when Dan originally
pitched this show

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:53.550
he said it was about an asshole
who learned to love strangers.

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:55.520
So is that still true?

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.250
How do you approach like
the overall character arcs?

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:00.280
CHRIS: I think Dan
loves some people now.

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:05.780
It's funny.

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:09.980
I think obviously
Jeff is a stand

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:12.104
in for Dan in a lot of ways.

00:21:12.104 --> 00:21:14.020
I think every one of the
characters he created

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.100
is a different facet of Dan.

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:20.790
But, yeah, Jeff I think
it came out of Dan, Dan

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:22.710
going to actually
Glendale Community College

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:24.370
and getting pulled
into a study group.

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:31.460
And in he's admittedly I think
sort of an anti-social person.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.410
And I think watching
that evolution

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:35.060
it's the same thing with Dan.

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:36.900
Dan, his first
instinct is not to sit

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.930
in a room full of other
writers and write.

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:41.690
He wants to hole up
and do his thing.

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:45.550
And I think an interesting
meta element to all

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:47.670
of this is that,
as Dan has said,

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:51.290
is that he was forced because
of how the system is set up

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:52.790
is he has to hire
writers, and he

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:54.210
has to sit in a
room with people,

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:55.668
and he has to hear
different ideas.

00:21:55.668 --> 00:21:59.350
And I came on
first season, and I

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:02.720
was one of those people
I'm sure he hated because I

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:05.360
opened my mouth, and I you know.

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:10.680
But I think he grew to sort
of love the strangers that he

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:12.680
was writing with, and I
think that is definitely

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:15.937
reflected in Jeff's
journey on the show.

00:22:15.937 --> 00:22:17.770
MODERATOR: And when
writing these characters

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:19.820
do you have an idea of
where you want everyone

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:22.924
to end up, like this happily
ever after world, or?

00:22:22.924 --> 00:22:24.090
CHRIS: We really try not to.

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:26.750
I think that's when we write
ourselves into trouble.

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:30.310
When you already know
what the end point is I

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:32.430
think we write ourselves
into troublesome areas.

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:36.640
And I would say third
season Dan had to go to NBC,

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:39.250
and he had to pitch
the whole season out

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:40.972
to-- This is what we're doing.

00:22:40.972 --> 00:22:41.930
This is everyone's arc.

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:47.740
This is their four quadrant
arc for the season down to

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:49.490
from Jeff to Chang.

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:51.664
And I think great
stuff came out of that,

00:22:51.664 --> 00:22:53.830
but I think those kind of
things then they bind you.

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:55.760
And then you're feeling,
oh, well you know,

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:58.475
this is where Chang
is head of security,

00:22:58.475 --> 00:23:00.560
but this is before he
takes over the school.

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:03.200
And you just find that
you don't have fun just

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.587
to be in the sandbox and
create with the characters.

00:23:05.587 --> 00:23:08.170
And I loved third season, and I
think we were able to do that.

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:09.920
We were able to do something
like multiple timelines

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.190
and have the episode
where the two of you guys

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:12.231
went in the Dreamatorium.

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:20.130
But I think it's so much
fun to discover a journey

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:23.952
rather than set an endpoint
and say this is where it is.

00:23:23.952 --> 00:23:26.160
MODERATOR: And so how are
things in the writers room?

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.000
Are you still writing to
the wee hours of the morning

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.041
the night before a shoot?

00:23:29.041 --> 00:23:32.106
CHRIS: We wrapped in December
and we're still writing.

00:23:32.106 --> 00:23:33.846
I am not kidding.

00:23:33.846 --> 00:23:39.070
We have an animated episode
that Dan and I have definitely,

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:43.996
definitely had a
recent all-nighter on.

00:23:43.996 --> 00:23:45.190
Like are you kidding me?

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:47.590
It's now January and we're
pulling an all-nighter.

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:49.242
It's going to be great.

00:23:49.242 --> 00:23:50.200
ALISON: It'll be great.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.199
We record it next week.

00:23:51.199 --> 00:23:51.990
CHRIS: What's that?

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:53.202
ALISON: I said we
record it next week.

00:23:53.202 --> 00:23:54.140
CHRIS: Oh yeah, you guys
are going to record it.

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:56.490
And it airs the following week.

00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:59.180
We're doing an
animated episode that

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:05.990
is in the style of the 1980's
animated series "GI Joe."

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:09.010
AUDIENCE: Oh yes!

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:11.320
CHRIS: And it's
going to be great.

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:12.436
It's really fantastic.

00:24:12.436 --> 00:24:13.102
MODERATOR: Cool.

00:24:13.102 --> 00:24:13.601
Cool.

00:24:13.601 --> 00:24:15.187
And I guess along
that line too one

00:24:15.187 --> 00:24:17.270
of things I think "Community"
does really strongly

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:22.280
is lampoon, pay homage to a
variety of TV genres, TV shows.

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.030
You know you did the
Nicolas Cage episode.

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:27.810
So you sort of have that check
box done from years and years.

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:31.260
So anything else on the
docket that you'd like to do?

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:34.049
Or any unexplored territory?

00:24:34.049 --> 00:24:36.590
CHRIS: Dan I always, it's funny,
we were meeting with writers

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:38.160
last year and we're
like, look, we're

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.670
not going to be concept first.

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:40.630
You know we're not
going to do-- That's

00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:41.671
when we get into trouble.

00:24:41.671 --> 00:24:43.410
We're not going to
go, oh, we're doing

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:45.360
you know a "Logan's
Run" episode.

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:47.318
Or we're not going to
say we're doing another D

00:24:47.318 --> 00:24:49.520
and D because then the
tail's wagging the dog.

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.639
Cut to bashing our head
against the wall going

00:24:51.639 --> 00:24:53.430
why did we say we're
doing another Dungeons

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:54.240
and Dragons episode?

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:55.781
How are we going to
crack this story?

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:02.720
If a story then takes
on an element that

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.810
has a concept to
it, that has, you

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:08.160
know, a feeling of a genre
then we'll run towards that.

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:11.180
But we really do try
not to just say, oh,

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:16.200
now we're doing our buddy cop
space movie cause then we're

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:20.826
bashing our heads going, wait,
how is Abed on the moon now?

00:25:20.826 --> 00:25:21.326
Why?

00:25:21.326 --> 00:25:21.692
Why?

00:25:21.692 --> 00:25:22.590
Why is that the moon.

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:23.890
It makes no sense.

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:28.620
So that said we have some
concepts coming, and the "GI

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:29.550
Joe" one.

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:34.170
This week's definitely takes
a very sci-fi-ish kind of feel

00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:34.990
to it.

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:35.840
ALISON: '70s sci-fi.

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:38.860
CHRIS: Sort of '70s sci-fi,
"Logan's Run" inspired.

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:42.270
Rob Schrab directed it.

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:43.250
Rob is brilliant.

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:44.220
He's Dan's old partner.

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:46.095
They created "Heat Vision
and Jack" together.

00:25:46.095 --> 00:25:47.520
And he's a brilliant director.

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.050
Really has a great visual style.

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:51.480
And we let him run.

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:54.050
There's stuff that you
will see in this episode

00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:59.340
that we kept on going if anyone
from the studio or the network

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:03.740
came by right now-- You dressed
in white robes in a white room

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:07.450
with orbs on your hand doing
a crazy Buck Rogers dance.

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:08.930
They would shut us down.

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:11.010
But luckily they
don't ever come--

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:12.430
ALISON: They don't come by.

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:16.350
DANNY: No one knows we're
still doing this show.

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:17.540
We're winning.

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:18.243
CHRIS: Yeah.

00:26:18.243 --> 00:26:19.870
DANNY: My favorite
visual of I think

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:21.960
the year is in this
episode, the first time you

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:24.500
see Hickey in the--

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:25.465
CHRIS: Yes.

00:26:25.465 --> 00:26:26.320
Yep.

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.070
DANNY: I just need to
say that, because it

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:30.620
is-- I remember when
I showed up on set,

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:33.036
and I didn't really know what
was going on in the episode,

00:26:33.036 --> 00:26:37.295
and I already saw him in the
wardrobe, and I was shocked.

00:26:37.295 --> 00:26:40.170
And this is after five
seasons of doing this show.

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:42.690
I was shocked by
what I was seeing.

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:44.680
That was a good feeling.

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:47.640
CHRIS: Definitely Rob took
the visuals of this episode

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.544
and ran to crazy town with them.

00:26:50.544 --> 00:26:52.210
It's really one of
my favorite episodes.

00:26:52.210 --> 00:27:00.947
And Ludwig, our composer, did
a really cool synth treatment

00:27:00.947 --> 00:27:01.780
of the music for it.

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:03.530
And I'm probably giving
way too much away,

00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:04.720
but watch it this Thursday.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.790
ALISON: You'll still watch it.

00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:09.822
MODERATOR: We have it on
the DVR, on the Google Play.

00:27:09.822 --> 00:27:11.806
JIM: Heard enough.

00:27:11.806 --> 00:27:12.798
Sick [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:12.798 --> 00:27:16.000
I'm out.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.410
MODERATOR: And I think
another fun trope that's

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:21.780
been going around is the idea
that all the NBC shows are

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:23.680
set in this sort of
similar universe.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.659
So you have "Community" and
"Chuck" doing a slight overlap,

00:27:26.659 --> 00:27:28.200
and then it sort of
expands to things

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:31.260
like "Cougar Town" for
example, and "Parks and Rec."

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:33.860
Like what crossovers is
the world ready for now?

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:35.360
Like Annie is the
next Leslie Knope.

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:38.610
You know Ron Swanson after
some chicken fingers.

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:40.990
CHRIS: They're running out
of shows unfortunately.

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:43.464
to do crossovers with.

00:27:43.464 --> 00:27:44.130
Or there's what?

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:45.421
There's "Parks and Rec" and us.

00:27:45.421 --> 00:27:47.020
So we're the last man standing.

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:48.050
What? "Game Night?"

00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:49.770
Yeah, do a "Community"
"Game Night."

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:51.270
JIM: "Community"
"Game Night," yeah.

00:27:53.334 --> 00:27:55.500
MODERATOR: Well Greendale
and Colorado and Indiana--

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:56.840
CHRIS: Chicago PD?

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:57.750
ALISON: Yeah.

00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:59.960
DANNY: Chicago Fire?

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:02.560
ALISON: I like the "Parks
and Rec" crossover idea.

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.790
So many good people.

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:13.900
So many possibles,
possibilities for connections,

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:16.621
to meet different people.

00:28:16.621 --> 00:28:18.870
MODERATOR: I'm sure there's
criminology in Pawnee that

00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:20.860
needs answered as well.

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:23.220
ALISON: And where
there is criminology--

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:24.450
JIM: Oh lord those pants--

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:26.800
ALISON: I'll be there.

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:27.710
JIM: Those pants.

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:29.880
ALISON: You will not
find those jeans.

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:30.840
DANNY: [INAUDIBLE]!

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:31.890
MODERATOR: Interesting.

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:34.330
So we'll have time for a
few audience questions.

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:36.300
So if you want to queue
up we can go to those.

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:40.160
I have some as well about
"Community," the future.

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.860
So you know coming up on
100 episodes, that's really

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:45.250
a good milestone, great
milestone for a lot of TV

00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:45.750
shows.

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:47.634
What does that mean to you?

00:28:47.634 --> 00:28:49.300
ALISON: Well, we're
not quite there yet.

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:50.210
CHRIS: Yeah, we got--

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:52.190
DANNY: We got 97?

00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:52.890
CHRIS: 97.

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:56.334
Or 96 if we don't finish
this animated one.

00:28:56.334 --> 00:28:57.250
JIM: We're very close.

00:28:57.250 --> 00:28:58.240
CHRIS: Yeah, 97.

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:03.560
I feel like, 100, it's
arbitrary I guess.

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:06.035
I'm excited about
our own arbitrary one

00:29:06.035 --> 00:29:08.160
that the fans created, the
six seasons and a movie.

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:09.659
If we could actually
pull that off I

00:29:09.659 --> 00:29:14.400
think that would be the
way to end this mother,

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:17.830
land it, pat each other on
the back, see each other,

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:21.660
I don't know, on Donald's
effects show doing cameos.

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:22.470
ALISON: Crossover!

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:23.261
DANNY: Or catering.

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:29.070
MODERATOR: And speaking of
the homages of other shows

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:29.570
you have.

00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:31.820
You have you know
the "Scrubs" theme,

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:33.670
"Who's the Boss," et cetera.

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:35.560
Picture some unknown
show in the future,

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:38.050
like show to be determined.

00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:39.500
What do they need
to do to capture

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:41.790
the essence of a
"Community" allusion.

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:46.099
CHRIS: Kinda 1.0.

00:29:46.099 --> 00:29:46.640
I don't know.

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:47.598
What do you guys think?

00:29:49.947 --> 00:29:50.780
DANNY: I don't know.

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:53.394
I mean I think smashing people
who seemingly don't seem

00:29:53.394 --> 00:29:55.810
like they should be friends
are put together in one place.

00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:57.690
That's one thing we did.

00:29:57.690 --> 00:30:01.150
ALISON: That is a thing we did.

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:03.380
It would be tough to do
a "Community" homage.

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:07.110
I don't how people would--
because our show to me

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:08.430
is so many different things.

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:10.240
JIM: I don't think we
have specific voice, which

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:11.573
is so wonderful about this show.

00:30:11.573 --> 00:30:13.540
CHRIS: It's like
staring into the sun.

00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:16.280
Like putting a
mirror into a mirror.

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:17.710
MODERATOR: Infinity.

00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:18.210
Cool.

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:19.918
I can see I have some
audience questions.

00:30:19.918 --> 00:30:20.765
Go ahead sir.

00:30:20.765 --> 00:30:23.390
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm wondering when
you guys have the movie, which

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:26.857
you're obviously
going to have, what

00:30:26.857 --> 00:30:28.440
do you wish you could
do in the movie?

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:30.030
Like if it were up
to you guys what's

00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:31.200
something you would
love to do in the movie

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.070
like you can't do
in a TV show format?

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:34.575
ALISON: Time travel.

00:30:34.575 --> 00:30:35.910
DANNY: Yeah.

00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:39.985
ALISON: Cause that
happens in movies, not TV.

00:30:39.985 --> 00:30:42.592
DANNY: Yeah, TV
doesn't do any of that.

00:30:42.592 --> 00:30:44.300
I can't think of one
time travel TV show.

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:47.276
ALISON: But we could
make it work in a movie.

00:30:47.276 --> 00:30:50.410
DANNY: Not a long
one, not a short one.

00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:51.160
ALISON: Movies.

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.860
DANNY: Time travel, you
can do that in movies.

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:53.940
CHRIS: I would just be
so interested to see

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:55.731
who we're going to cast
as your characters.

00:30:55.731 --> 00:30:59.926
I mean there are really some
great, great, oh my god,

00:30:59.926 --> 00:31:02.015
Chris Evans as Abed?

00:31:02.015 --> 00:31:02.680
DANNY: Yes.

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:04.375
He would be such a good--
He would be a better Abed.

00:31:04.375 --> 00:31:05.333
CHRIS: Oh my god, yeah.

00:31:05.333 --> 00:31:07.690
JIM: A-list playing our
parts would be fantastic.

00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:10.240
It would be nice to do
a movie where there's

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:13.810
a movie in the movie with
A-list actors playing us.

00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:15.410
And we're just
watching ourselves.

00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:17.410
CHRIS: Well, at the very
least the trailer, just

00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:19.377
to trick people
into the theater.

00:31:19.377 --> 00:31:20.710
DANNY: I need to see this movie.

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:22.251
JIM: The exciting
thing about a movie

00:31:22.251 --> 00:31:24.091
would be getting
to shoot outside.

00:31:24.091 --> 00:31:24.590
CHRIS: Yes.

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:24.900
ALISON: Yes.

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:26.358
JIM: The idea of
what it would look

00:31:26.358 --> 00:31:29.452
like if sun naturally
hit our face.

00:31:29.452 --> 00:31:31.910
DANNY: People always ask us
like what do you guys shoot at?

00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:34.640
And we're like we shoot inside
of one stage, everything,

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:35.362
always.

00:31:35.362 --> 00:31:36.570
JIM: Well that wasn't inside.

00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:39.846
We used to go outside, and
then, you know, things happen.

00:31:39.846 --> 00:31:42.470
CHRIS: The accountants sit there
with a calculator going, nope,

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:44.395
sun is too much.

00:31:44.395 --> 00:31:44.895
Nope.

00:31:44.895 --> 00:31:45.550
Stay inside.

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:47.620
We've got makeup for that.

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:50.192
We got makeup to look
like you've been outside.

00:31:50.192 --> 00:31:51.650
No, honestly it's
one of the things

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:54.860
I've been saying to Dan,
if there's a sixth season,

00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:57.030
we got to figure out a
way to get back outside.

00:31:57.030 --> 00:32:01.620
I mean because it's
just expensive.

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:04.080
There was a little
episode called "Hot Lava"

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:08.570
that broke the bank very early
on, and had people yelling,

00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:11.760
doing this a lot for the rest
of like the next three months,

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:12.990
no, no, no.

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:17.780
And let's not do concept
episodes anywhere.

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:20.900
Let's just at least be able to
go outside to the Lucy Park.

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:23.056
And it's funny, I
catch occasionally,

00:32:23.056 --> 00:32:24.430
like I'm flipping
channels, and I

00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:27.096
see like episodes where
I'm like, oh yeah,

00:32:27.096 --> 00:32:28.480
we used to go outside.

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.260
ALISON: We used to
walk through the quad.

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:29.525
CHRIS: Yeah.

00:32:29.525 --> 00:32:31.005
DANNY: Remember our first scene.

00:32:31.005 --> 00:32:32.005
We were walking outside.

00:32:32.005 --> 00:32:33.004
ALISON: Walking outside.

00:32:33.004 --> 00:32:34.320
DANNY: Aw, it felt so good.

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:35.270
ALISON: Yeah.

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:38.827
CHRIS: So yeah, aren't you
excited to see outdoors.

00:32:38.827 --> 00:32:41.160
Aren't you excited to go sit
in a dark theater and watch

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:42.220
the sun?

00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:43.417
DANNY: We don't need much.

00:32:43.417 --> 00:32:44.875
AUDIENCE: Ass Crack
Bandit you guys

00:32:44.875 --> 00:32:47.330
were outside [INAUDIBLE]
Hall but it was raining.

00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:48.842
JIM: Yeah.

00:32:48.842 --> 00:32:50.595
You can step just outside.

00:32:50.595 --> 00:32:51.969
ALISON: Just step outside, yeah.

00:32:51.969 --> 00:32:54.260
MODERATOR: And bring a new
light of day to "Community."

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:55.635
Thank you guys so much.

00:32:55.635 --> 00:32:58.000
Go ahead.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.965
AUDIENCE: Jim, what's
your favorite costume

00:32:59.965 --> 00:33:01.862
that the dean has worn.

00:33:01.862 --> 00:33:04.710
JIM: In all the years?

00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:06.235
AUDIENCE: Yeah, across the--

00:33:06.235 --> 00:33:08.940
JIM: Across the universe?

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:09.840
I don't know.

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:15.140
I mean I always feel like I can
never not reference the five

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:20.600
entrances from our
first clip episode

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:23.825
because it was just such a joy
to shoot because they just sort

00:33:23.825 --> 00:33:26.720
of set the camera up, and I
would run off, get made up

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:31.950
into the new one, come in while
Gillian and Joel would just

00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:33.740
change little
outfit we'd put on.

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:34.772
A remote control car.

00:33:34.772 --> 00:33:36.355
We don't know what
that storyline was.

00:33:36.355 --> 00:33:38.188
CHRIS: Well that was
the one with a callback

00:33:38.188 --> 00:33:42.390
to the quadrocopter, when you
guys got into the quadrocopter.

00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:44.280
JIM: So I mean that
whole sort of run

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:47.082
of costumes was great,
from Tina Turner to--

00:33:47.082 --> 00:33:48.540
ALISON: You made
a hot Tina Turner.

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:49.480
JIM: Well, thank you.

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:50.010
Thank you.

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:50.510
Yes.

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:52.200
I learned how to walk
in high heels that year.

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:52.866
That's for sure.

00:33:52.866 --> 00:33:54.480
And now I can't stop.

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:01.270
MODERATOR: New York
Fashion Week on the docket.

00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:03.350
CHRIS: I will say
in no this week,

00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:07.280
but the following week
the dean is in a costume

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:11.540
and also does one of the
funniest things I've ever seen.

00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:14.909
It's episode 509.

00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:16.495
JIM: Yeah, that was fun.

00:34:16.495 --> 00:34:17.945
CHRIS: I don't want to spoil it.

00:34:17.945 --> 00:34:18.934
I'll just peanut.

00:34:18.934 --> 00:34:20.420
I'll just say the word peanut.

00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:21.380
JIM: Yes.

00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:27.110
It was a blast, but
a stressful blast.

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:28.252
Yeah, anyway you'll see.

00:34:28.252 --> 00:34:29.460
CHRIS: It's in the cold open.

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:30.500
You don't even have to
watch it after that.

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:32.000
You just watch the
first two minutes

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.013
and then go over to "BAZINGA"

00:34:34.013 --> 00:34:35.429
ALISON: I don't
even remember what

00:34:35.429 --> 00:34:37.003
happens in the rest
of that episode.

00:34:37.003 --> 00:34:38.461
CHRIS: That's the
roommate episode.

00:34:38.461 --> 00:34:40.385
ALISON: Ohh

00:34:40.385 --> 00:34:41.820
DANNY: You already forgot us?

00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:43.070
JIM: You get two great things.

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:46.429
You get the long story you
told about the roommate thing,

00:34:46.429 --> 00:34:48.027
and you get this one
in the cold open.

00:34:48.027 --> 00:34:49.610
MODERATOR: So it
ties it all together.

00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:50.580
JIM: Yeah.

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:52.840
MODERATOR: Cool.

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:53.590
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:56.850
Well, since no one's behind
me I can quick follow up.

00:34:56.850 --> 00:35:05.250
Danny, in your words
Nicolas Cage good or bad?

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:07.780
ALISON: Ooo, in your words.

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:14.050
DANNY: Good.

00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:14.940
ALISON: Good job.

00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:15.417
DANNY: Thank you so much.

00:35:15.417 --> 00:35:16.125
CHRIS: Nailed it.

00:35:16.125 --> 00:35:18.700
DANNY: We fight about it,
but yeah, I think it's good.

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:21.170
I think we do need
that person and help

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:22.956
us question whether
it is good or bad.

00:35:22.956 --> 00:35:24.644
I think good.

00:35:24.644 --> 00:35:26.060
CHRIS: Now we're
just going to run

00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:27.815
a 20 minute take of
you doing Nicolas.

00:35:27.815 --> 00:35:29.610
We have so many
outtakes from that.

00:35:29.610 --> 00:35:32.140
We were just watching him
on the monitor and howling,

00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:35.570
and then they make
him do it again.

00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:37.530
DANNY: Yeah, talk
about having to get rid

00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:39.350
of any self consciousness.

00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:42.690
When me and Dan Harmon
are behind like the set

00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:44.525
practicing Nicolas
Cage impressions

00:35:44.525 --> 00:35:47.300
and just doing sexy cat voices.

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:50.120
Dan's is really good, yeah.

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:51.220
Yeah, sexy cat.

00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:53.310
MODERATOR: So is
that a DVD special

00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:54.990
feature we should be
on the lookout for?

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:55.960
CHRIS: Should be.

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:57.510
Absolutely.

00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:59.170
I hope so.

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:03.440
Oh, speaking of DVD, I was
thinking remember the first DVD

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:06.690
at the end of the year Dan did
employee performance reviews.

00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:07.520
DANNY: Yes!

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:08.020
I

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:08.546
JIM: Yes.

00:36:08.546 --> 00:36:10.670
CHRIS: Should you guys do
peer performance reviews?

00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:12.140
How did you guys do this season?

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:12.750
JIM: Oh.

00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:13.736
Oh, nice.

00:36:13.736 --> 00:36:15.540
CHRIS: Alison and Danny, do Jim.

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:17.480
JIM: Oh, thank you.

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.959
ALISON: Jim.

00:36:19.959 --> 00:36:21.000
JIM: That speaks volumes.

00:36:24.838 --> 00:36:26.500
DANNY: Good or bad Jim?

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:29.520
JIM: Wait, aren't you
supposed to evaluate me?

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:32.346
DANNY: Are we?

00:36:32.346 --> 00:36:35.130
JIM: This feels
just like it, yes.

00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:36.410
You're evaluating me.

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:37.898
You want me to say how I felt?

00:36:37.898 --> 00:36:39.731
DANNY: Why don't we
start there and just see

00:36:39.731 --> 00:36:40.564
where that leads us.

00:36:40.564 --> 00:36:48.729
JIM: I felt like I did my best,

00:36:48.729 --> 00:36:49.520
DANNY: You can cry.

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:50.252
You can cry.

00:36:50.252 --> 00:36:55.400
JIM: And I did what I
thought I should do.

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:56.514
ALISON: That was great.

00:36:56.514 --> 00:36:57.014
DANNY: Next!

00:36:57.014 --> 00:36:57.555
ALISON: Next!

00:36:57.555 --> 00:37:00.000
DANNY: Next!

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.332
ALISON: Do you have
a question sir?

00:37:04.332 --> 00:37:05.680
AUDIENCE: Maybe.

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:08.770
I think "Community"s done a
great job of being absolutely

00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:11.251
not normal at all in every way.

00:37:11.251 --> 00:37:12.000
ALISON: Thank you.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.791
AUDIENCE: I'm curious
if you guys have ever

00:37:13.791 --> 00:37:18.420
considered any cliche ideas
like actual couples developing

00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:22.000
or long term romances
like you seem

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.240
to see in all the other
sitcoms these days?

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:25.154
DANNY: Three cameras.

00:37:25.154 --> 00:37:26.570
CHRIS: The thing
that's keeping us

00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:31.265
from being a popular
sitcom you want to see?

00:37:31.265 --> 00:37:31.806
I don't know.

00:37:31.806 --> 00:37:32.681
How do you guys feel?

00:37:32.681 --> 00:37:34.760
ALISON: Well it
happened last season.

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:40.082
You know, Britta and Troy
dated for the entire season.

00:37:40.082 --> 00:37:41.290
Well, and then they broke up.

00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:45.016
We sort of saw their entire
relationship over the season,

00:37:45.016 --> 00:37:47.710
and I thought it
was super weird.

00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:48.410
I don't know.

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:49.670
I thought it was strange.

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:53.720
I think the problem is that
we've set up this group as such

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:56.020
a thing, and it's the
group is the thing.

00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:56.707
It's a family.

00:37:56.707 --> 00:37:59.290
And even though we've made all
those jokes in the first season

00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:02.560
about how everyone could be
sexually attracted to everyone,

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:06.500
and I still think that's true,
it just functions as a family,

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:08.220
and everyone loves each other.

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:09.210
And it's this unit.

00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:12.205
And it just seems
a little forced,

00:38:12.205 --> 00:38:14.460
or something feels
unnatural I feel

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:16.600
like when you try to go
too far in that direction.

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:19.390
I mean I love the
Jeff and Annie stuff.

00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:22.690
I love working with Joel and I
love exploring that chemistry,

00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:27.780
but even that by now feels like
it would be so strange to just

00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:29.920
be like Jeff and
Annie are dating now,

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:33.280
and they're like walking
down the halls holding hands.

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:39.066
It just doesn't
quite fit our show.

00:38:39.066 --> 00:38:40.440
CHRIS: It's tough,
because I know

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:43.180
there's lots of people out
there, the shippers, who

00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:46.146
want Annie and Jeff or Annie
and-- I mean Annie and Britta.

00:38:46.146 --> 00:38:47.187
ALISON: Annie and Britta.

00:38:47.187 --> 00:38:47.687
There are.

00:38:47.687 --> 00:38:49.060
There are those people.

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:52.340
CHRIS: I stumbled on to
that web page accidentally.

00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:56.010
ALISON: Stumbled on to it.

00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:57.520
CHRIS: You know,
Jeff and Britta.

00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:00.480
They just want somebody,
something to be shipping.

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:04.670
It is tough, because when you
created a family like this

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:07.670
you don't really--
it's a bottle that's

00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:10.360
tough to once you
uncork it to cork.

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:13.190
And it's one of those
things we've talked about,

00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:17.440
and I know a lot of
other sitcoms do it.

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:20.350
And I will say the romance
stuff, on other sitcoms,

00:39:20.350 --> 00:39:23.409
and it's just my taste, usually
I'm not that interested in it.

00:39:23.409 --> 00:39:24.200
I'm not interested.

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:26.970
I'm interested in how these
people are relating as friends,

00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:29.130
how they've betrayed
each other as friends,

00:39:29.130 --> 00:39:33.180
whether the paternal
elements that Jeff has,

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:35.397
or whether he's acting
like a child in relation

00:39:35.397 --> 00:39:36.730
to some of the other characters.

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:39.610
It was always more
interesting to me,

00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:41.719
but, you know,
I'm super asexual.

00:39:41.719 --> 00:39:42.260
I don't know.

00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:44.093
ALISON: Well, I was
gonna say our characters

00:39:44.093 --> 00:39:45.710
are almost kind of asexual.

00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:49.162
None of our characters
are really like sexy.

00:39:49.162 --> 00:39:50.120
I mean I guess Jeff is.

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:51.590
JIM: Well.

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:52.090
ALISON: OK.

00:39:52.090 --> 00:39:52.590
I'm sorry.

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:53.410
I apologize.

00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:54.330
I apologize.

00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:55.056
DANNY: Sorry Jim.

00:39:55.056 --> 00:39:56.190
JIM: I'm super sexy.

00:39:56.190 --> 00:40:00.410
I just feel like I'm very sexy.

00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:01.770
ALISON: Dean is very sexy.

00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:04.315
And Jeff is sexy.

00:40:04.315 --> 00:40:05.440
CHRIS: He's a director now.

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.881
You can't say those
things to him.

00:40:07.881 --> 00:40:08.845
ALISON: Well in person.

00:40:08.845 --> 00:40:10.190
I'm talking about
our characters Jim.

00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:10.540
JIM: No, no, no.

00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:10.890
I get it.

00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:11.598
We'll talk later.

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:16.910
ALISON: But I do feel like
everyone's sort of interested

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:19.780
in other things, and
that just doesn't

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:22.990
seem to be like a high
priority for these people.

00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:25.010
I mean that said I do
find it interesting

00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:28.180
when we see other
people brought in

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:30.310
to be love interests
outside the group.

00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:32.640
That I think is interesting.

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:35.570
CHRIS: And I think
we'll see how,

00:40:35.570 --> 00:40:38.657
if this show even continues how
romance will rear it's head.

00:40:38.657 --> 00:40:40.240
And it seems to me
that that's the way

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:42.609
to do it if you're
going to do it.

00:40:42.609 --> 00:40:45.150
And you know the circling the
wagons these people who are now

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:47.940
like brothers and sisters
like when a stranger enters

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:50.790
the midst and being
threatened by it.

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:53.355
Obviously there's
still feelings there,

00:40:53.355 --> 00:40:56.680
and I think these characters are
still confused about themselves

00:40:56.680 --> 00:41:01.840
and their lives that they
don't-- I think sometimes there

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:06.700
is some Jeff stuff coming up
in terms of his feelings about

00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:14.560
people in the group, and I
think still he has a hard time

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:18.530
differentiating between whether
something is erotic love

00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:25.800
or love of these people that
he cares so deeply about.

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:28.300
MODERATOR: And along those
lines coat check girl?

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:29.704
Will we see any
more on that end?

00:41:29.704 --> 00:41:31.120
CHRIS: Oh yeah,
they start dating.

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:33.044
I forgot.

00:41:33.044 --> 00:41:33.710
ALISON: But see.

00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:35.120
It's someone outside the group.

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.340
Outside the group.

00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:39.860
CHRIS: Yeah, Brie
Larson, who's great,

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:43.565
we have coming up on 509.

00:41:43.565 --> 00:41:45.070
MODERATOR: Cool.

00:41:45.070 --> 00:41:48.770
So I had a few small
questions as well.

00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:51.180
One thing that I really
enjoy about "Community"

00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:53.430
is just the amount of callbacks.

00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:56.010
You know Britta got the
iPad Nano this season.

00:41:56.010 --> 00:41:57.854
So check mark on that.

00:41:57.854 --> 00:41:59.270
How do you keep
track of all that?

00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:02.370
Is there a master list of things
that you need to go back from?

00:42:02.370 --> 00:42:02.950
CHRIS: Yes.

00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:07.160
It's called fans on
Twitter constantly

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:09.765
bothering Harmon
about when's Britta

00:42:09.765 --> 00:42:10.890
going to get her iPad Nano?

00:42:10.890 --> 00:42:12.120
We go oh yeah.

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:14.290
And so it worked out perfectly.

00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:16.490
No, but believe me.

00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:17.450
That's the system.

00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:23.440
People don't stop bothering
Dan, and thank god.

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:25.740
Because that was
a great callback.

00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:26.440
MODERATOR: Another
question right here.

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:27.020
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:28.186
I'll ask a question for Jim.

00:42:30.965 --> 00:42:32.840
For "Freaky Friday" you
got to suddenly write

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:34.214
for these characters
who you were

00:42:34.214 --> 00:42:37.290
like alongside for
most of the show.

00:42:37.290 --> 00:42:40.640
Has like suddenly having
more power over the universe

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:44.800
giving you this like feeling
of-- Has the power corrupted

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:46.011
basically is the question?

00:42:46.011 --> 00:42:47.510
JIM: Are you asking
if personally--?

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:49.176
ALISON: I mean he
thinks he's very sexy.

00:42:49.176 --> 00:42:50.140
JIM: Yeah well.

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:51.580
ALISON: I mean he is.

00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:55.580
JIM: Personally do I have more
power now that that happened?

00:42:55.580 --> 00:43:00.380
I feel like these two
put me on a pedestal.

00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:01.280
Is that fair?

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:02.110
DANNY: Oh I worship
you immediately.

00:43:02.110 --> 00:43:02.620
JIM: Thank you.

00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:03.120
Thank you.

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:06.580
No, I was so lucky to
have had that experience

00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:11.670
because at least I love this
show sort of unconditionally.

00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:15.380
And I feel like the
beauty of getting

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:18.020
to write "Community" is that
the voices are so clear,

00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:21.610
and what was created
was so clear.

00:43:21.610 --> 00:43:28.350
So no, because I always--
to answer your question, no.

00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:30.750
I don't think it
changed anything to me

00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:32.460
other than that I
got an opportunity

00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:36.964
to do something
that was wonderful.

00:43:36.964 --> 00:43:38.380
MODERATOR: Well
it's not every day

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:42.230
we have an Academy Award
winning person on the show.

00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:43.564
JIM: Who speaks so eloquently.

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:49.947
MODERATOR: So another
few small questions.

00:43:49.947 --> 00:43:51.780
What do you think
happened to the cool study

00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:53.560
group over the
past five seasons?

00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:55.340
The one with Jack--

00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:57.895
CHRIS: One was in a movie
about Google I thought.

00:43:57.895 --> 00:44:01.130
MODERATOR: Oh, that's
"Internship", college.

00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:04.080
I should've known that answer
when I wrote the question.

00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:04.990
All right.

00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:08.210
And you also had a big reveal
about Starburns this year.

00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:10.840
What do you think he's been up
to since the days of the Ass

00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:13.220
Crack Bandit?

00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:16.640
DANNY: Probably
doing a lot of math.

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:19.300
CHRIS: He does do math.

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:20.510
He does like it.

00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:21.750
Building well.

00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:25.660
Definitely researching cat cars.

00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:29.022
And hoarding, lurking.

00:44:29.022 --> 00:44:30.450
He's like that
movie "Bad Ronald."

00:44:30.450 --> 00:44:32.866
I think he's just sort of
living in the walls of Greendale

00:44:32.866 --> 00:44:35.630
and stealing people's
food, and watching them.

00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:38.579
But anything he can do probably
to smoke and try to get high

00:44:38.579 --> 00:44:39.120
I'm guessing?

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:39.840
JIM: Yeah.

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:41.810
I mean, you know
the repercussions

00:44:41.810 --> 00:44:44.780
of doing something horrible
at our school has very little.

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:46.410
There are very little.

00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:49.460
As far as I'm concerned he's
just wondering, you know.

00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:52.620
He took a bullet and that's it.

00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:55.380
I think the best
thing about Greendale

00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:58.020
is it just sort of
erases what happened.

00:44:58.020 --> 00:44:59.834
Let's just move on.

00:44:59.834 --> 00:45:00.750
CHRIS: Well, yeah, no.

00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:01.791
We've got something else.

00:45:01.791 --> 00:45:04.292
We got like there's a
fire in the cafeteria.

00:45:04.292 --> 00:45:06.750
No there's always some new
nonsense to distract everyone.

00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:09.210
So the dean's always got
some new harebrained scheme.

00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:10.070
JIM: Right.

00:45:10.070 --> 00:45:10.860
MODERATOR: And the
dean is the rug

00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:12.080
under which
everything gets swept.

00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:13.700
JIM: Oh, there's a
paper trail leading

00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:16.280
to every single character
and what they did wrong.

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:17.610
So I feel like it's OK.

00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:19.560
Everyone's in the same boat.

00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:20.440
Look, we fucked up.

00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:23.090
We get it.

00:45:23.090 --> 00:45:24.870
MODERATOR: So you all
display some really,

00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:26.620
really cool hidden
talents, and I actually

00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:29.140
saw Alison in concert a few
weeks ago at SF Sketchfest,

00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:30.410
which was pretty amazing.

00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:31.214
ALISON: Thank you!

00:45:31.214 --> 00:45:31.880
MODERATOR: Yeah.

00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:33.579
So my pleasure.

00:45:33.579 --> 00:45:35.120
I'm glad that the
tickets worked out.

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:39.540
And anything else that we'll
be seeing hidden talent wise,

00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:41.647
or that you'd like to display?

00:45:41.647 --> 00:45:42.230
ALISON: Danny.

00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:45.240
DANNY: March 12, I have a ESPN
30 for 30 short coming out

00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:47.230
called "Untucked " on Grantland.

00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:47.974
Please watch it.

00:45:47.974 --> 00:45:50.140
It's about basketball jerseys
and why I should never

00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:51.056
be playing basketball.

00:45:53.530 --> 00:45:54.030
ALISON: Yes.

00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:57.760
He directed it and everything.

00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:00.425
DANNY: I directed it.

00:46:00.425 --> 00:46:01.050
But it was fun.

00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:01.660
ALISON: Where is it coming out?

00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:02.310
Say it again.

00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:05.000
DANNY: It's an ESPN
30 for 30 short

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.320
called "Untucked" on Grantland.

00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:08.395
ALISON: What's Grantland?

00:46:08.395 --> 00:46:09.620
DANNY: It's a website.

00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:14.892
It's an ESPN ish kind of website
about sports topics of the day

00:46:14.892 --> 00:46:15.850
and that kind of thing.

00:46:15.850 --> 00:46:17.895
So every month they
have a short now.

00:46:17.895 --> 00:46:20.270
And it's a little peak into
Marquette basketball history,

00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:22.132
their jerseys.

00:46:22.132 --> 00:46:22.960
It's fun.

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:26.140
It's about 1977's championship
team and a journey that

00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:28.944
was designed by [INAUDIBLE]
Ellis, a player on the team.

00:46:28.944 --> 00:46:30.780
So check it out.

00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:32.664
MODERATOR: Anything
on your deck Jim?

00:46:32.664 --> 00:46:33.330
JIM: No, no, no.

00:46:33.330 --> 00:46:34.163
No I'm just kidding.

00:46:34.163 --> 00:46:35.610
MODERATOR: [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:37.597
Watching people go
down the water slides.

00:46:37.597 --> 00:46:38.930
JIM: Yeah that's pretty much it.

00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:41.980
No, yeah, just back to writing.

00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:45.890
You know, trying to.

00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:47.279
I know that was way boring.

00:46:47.279 --> 00:46:48.570
MODERATOR: Writing's important.

00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:49.850
CHRIS: You just
directed a Fox pilot.

00:46:49.850 --> 00:46:50.230
Come on.

00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:51.190
JIM: Yes, we did do that.

00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:53.210
CHRIS: You just got to go hang
out in Burbank and watch people

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:53.750
testing it.

00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:54.890
JIM: We tested it, yes.

00:46:54.890 --> 00:46:57.600
No, Nat and I did
direct a pilot for Fox.

00:46:57.600 --> 00:46:58.595
So we'll see.

00:46:58.595 --> 00:46:59.750
MODERATOR: Cool.

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:02.150
And I also from Vickie,
to Fat Neal, to Garrett,

00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:03.860
I really like the
back stories that

00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:07.370
are so prevalent in the
supporting characters.

00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:09.560
And were there
any cool anecdotes

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:11.742
with working with them
that you'd like to share?

00:47:11.742 --> 00:47:13.950
CHRIS: You guys work with
them probably more closely.

00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:14.575
ALISON: I know.

00:47:14.575 --> 00:47:16.420
Well, I would like to
say before anecdotes

00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:20.530
that I love-- Our supporting
characters are great,

00:47:20.530 --> 00:47:24.560
like the fabric that makes
up Greendale the college.

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:28.550
And over the years we've just
held on to so many of them.

00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:31.090
And they're all
wonderful people,

00:47:31.090 --> 00:47:32.770
except for Paradox
was my favorite

00:47:32.770 --> 00:47:34.046
and he's never come back.

00:47:34.046 --> 00:47:35.435
DANNY: There was like 2
years where we'd always say I

00:47:35.435 --> 00:47:36.361
[INAUDIBLE].

00:47:36.361 --> 00:47:38.220
ALISON: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:39.600
DANNY: And that
was his one line.

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:41.070
ALISON: It was his one line.

00:47:41.070 --> 00:47:43.030
And then there was
an episode later

00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:45.504
where somebody was
like it's a paradox.

00:47:45.504 --> 00:47:47.170
And I was like they're
not going to have

00:47:47.170 --> 00:47:49.290
Paradox walk by
in the background.

00:47:49.290 --> 00:47:50.900
I was that fan on
Twitter like um,

00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:55.410
excuse me, dear "Community"
is Paradox going to be by,

00:47:55.410 --> 00:47:56.400
and it never happens.

00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:58.909
CHRIS: Opportunity missed.

00:47:58.909 --> 00:48:00.325
DANNY: But Magnitude,
all of them.

00:48:00.325 --> 00:48:03.460
I think what's so
cool about our show is

00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:06.210
that all the characters
are so specific that they

00:48:06.210 --> 00:48:07.926
do really fit into this world.

00:48:07.926 --> 00:48:08.550
CHRIS: Leonard.

00:48:08.550 --> 00:48:09.410
DANNY: Oh, Leonard.

00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:10.620
ALISON: Leonard.

00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:13.020
And we love them,
and you guys end up

00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:15.210
sort of writing stuff
for them or letting

00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:17.270
them do stuff that speaks
true to them as well.

00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:22.604
In the "Hot Lava" episode
we're all on Shirley island,

00:48:22.604 --> 00:48:24.020
and the island's
going to go down,

00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:26.150
and people are like
yelling confessions,

00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:29.070
and Magnitude is like
I'm actually British,

00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:31.710
because the actor that
plays Magnitude is British.

00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:37.300
CHRIS: And those were really
Erik Charles Nielsen's

00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:38.400
only pair of pants.

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:40.377
He couldn't get them dirty.

00:48:40.377 --> 00:48:40.960
ALISON: Maybe.

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:41.459
Maybe.

00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:46.980
MODERATOR: So my last question.

00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:49.300
Not every show has
its own fan sponsored

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:52.080
Con, video games,
spin-off series.

00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:53.810
What message do you
have for the fans

00:48:53.810 --> 00:48:55.770
as we enter the home
stretch for season five?

00:48:58.682 --> 00:48:59.390
CHRIS: Thank you?

00:48:59.390 --> 00:49:00.890
DANNY: Thank you.

00:49:00.890 --> 00:49:01.610
CHRIS: Thank you.

00:49:01.610 --> 00:49:06.530
I mean honestly it's
no matter whether it's

00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:09.790
a rerun of "The Big Bang
Theory" which gets like a 2.9

00:49:09.790 --> 00:49:12.628
or a new episode
that gets a 5.1 there

00:49:12.628 --> 00:49:17.530
is a little tiny army of people
who love the show as much as we

00:49:17.530 --> 00:49:20.900
do who show up and watch
it live, don't you?

00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:23.139
And no matter what
happens we still get,

00:49:23.139 --> 00:49:24.930
or unless we'll see
what happens this week,

00:49:24.930 --> 00:49:27.210
but we still get like the same
3 million people showing up

00:49:27.210 --> 00:49:28.085
week in and week out.

00:49:28.085 --> 00:49:33.370
And in this changing
TV landscape

00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:39.090
to have people still showing up
and loving the show says a lot.

00:49:39.090 --> 00:49:42.780
And it's the reason why this
little show that probably

00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:44.960
should have died after
the end of season one

00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:48.826
is halfway through
its fifth season.

00:49:48.826 --> 00:49:49.680
So, yeah.

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:51.221
MODERATOR: Well,
we'll end with that.

00:49:51.221 --> 00:49:53.320
Hashtag six seasons and a movie.

00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:55.460
Thank you all for
stopping bye today.

00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:57.260
So give them a
round of applause.

00:49:57.260 --> 00:49:59.110
ALISON: Thank you.
