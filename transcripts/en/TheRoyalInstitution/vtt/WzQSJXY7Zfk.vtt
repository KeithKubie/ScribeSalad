00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:18.230
-All of us are wired to appreciate natural
beauty. At any time in history, in any culture,

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.710
if you look at an ocean, a mountain or a beautiful
forest scene, everyone appreciates that. It

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.560
hits us fairly deep, we're wired that way.
And when you see your planet that way, in

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.909
its sum total from space, all those senses
get overwhelmed.

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:42.030
- I first saw planet Earth from space still
during the launch, outside the atmosphere

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.179
of Earth and we were over the Pacific Ocean,
and just looking at that gorgeous blue, dotted

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:50.750
with white clouds and the black of space.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:58.899
-This impossibly blue planet in this impossibly
black sky just hanging out there. It is really

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:00.379
breathtaking.

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.729
-Even though you've seen the Earth through
movies, pictures, when you look at the Earth

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:12.030
with your own eyes, changing very fast at
the speed of 8km per second, what you see

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.580
is beautiful. you have tears in your eyes.
Even if you are a tough person you can't avoid

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.550
becoming a child again. We wish all human
kind could epxperience this view of Earth.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:31.750
-It is this perpetual dynamic picture show
that you never get tired of. Even 6 months

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.700
into the flight, if you pass by a window,
it's like a magnet that draws you to it, you

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.810
want to pick up a camera and take pictures
of it.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:47.560
-As we fly around the Earth, every 92 minutes
the Earth has twisted around by about 13 degrees

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.820
underneath us, so the next time you fly another
orbit the Earth has moved round again so you

00:01:51.820 --> 00:02:00.700
get yet another view, which is one of the
reasons why it's so beautiful. It's entrancing.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:08.340
This constantly moving Earth is something
that nobody ever gets tired of looking at.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.069
-You could spend hours a day for months looking
out the window, and never get tired of it.

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.750
You could never learn all of the Earth and
it's very dynamic. Things change with seasons.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.840
There are always lightning storms going on
somewhere on Earth at night, and you can never

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.540
fail to see these lightning flashes.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.970
-It lights up a whole circle of clouds around
it, and that seems to set off another flash

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.370
a few hundred miles away somewhere else, so
you get this dudududuh, of lightning, then

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.370
another bit somewhere else: dudududuh.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:50.689
-You can see the Northern Lights like you've
never seen them before, which is just unbelievable

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:55.680
from space because you're looking at a huge
spectrum of the geomagnetic field that produces

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:04.569
the aurora. The other big feature is city
lights. You see the distribution of people

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:18.310
on the planet based on the lights of the cities.
It's really striking.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.950
-We're only a couple hundred miles away. We're
circling the planet. But just that change

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:30.200
in perception, you're ability to step back
that far, prioritizes how you feel about the

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.250
planet.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:47.739
-You believe that Earth is a spaceship. You
can't avoid the comparison between Earth,

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:53.840
looking like a finite object in front of your
eyes, and your own spaceship which is closed

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.409
with limited resources. All humankind being
part of the same unique crew.

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:03.900
-Certainly you know that there's conflict
down there. Certainly you know that there's

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:11.519
pain and suffering and injustice, all these
things that you certainly feel strongly when

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:16.970
you're on the Earth, and you know that they're
still there. But that's replaced for a moment

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:24.610
by how beautiful it is. I remember thinking,
'I wish everyone could experience this view

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.590
of their home planet so that maybe it would
reprioritise what's important to them, and

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.220
make them less angry t their neighbours and
more concerned about doing what they can so

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.840
that we preserve the beautiful planet we live
on.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:50.340
-You look at that vastness of infinite stars,
and that's when you start to realise how insignificant

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.440
not just you as an individual are, but how
insignificant the Earth is. how insignificant

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:03.970
the whole human race actually is. Great to
think about our place in that, but then beyond:

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.310
what does that mean, when you go further and
further? We like to wonder what our boundaries

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:23.200
really are, and I'd like to think we don't
really have any boundaries.
