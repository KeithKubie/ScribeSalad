00:00:00.274 --> 00:00:01.451
- [Voiceover] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.451 --> 00:00:05.828
is a little bit of a deep
dive on transcription.

00:00:05.828 --> 00:00:07.968
And just as a bit of a review,

00:00:07.968 --> 00:00:09.648
we touch on it on the video on

00:00:09.648 --> 00:00:12.951
replication, transcription
and translation.

00:00:12.951 --> 00:00:15.269
Transcription in everyday
language just means to

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.873
rewrite something or to
rewrite some information

00:00:17.873 --> 00:00:18.958
in another form.

00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:20.783
And that's essentially
what's happening here.

00:00:20.783 --> 00:00:23.975
Transcription is when we
take the information encoded

00:00:23.975 --> 00:00:26.831
in the gene in DNA and encode essentially

00:00:26.831 --> 00:00:30.104
that same information in mRNA.

00:00:30.104 --> 00:00:33.271
So transcription we are going from DNA

00:00:35.475 --> 00:00:36.892
to messenger RNA,

00:00:39.135 --> 00:00:40.333
and we're gonna, in this video,

00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:43.549
focus on genes that code for proteins.

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:45.755
So this first step is the transcription,

00:00:45.755 --> 00:00:48.351
the DNA to messenger RNA,

00:00:48.351 --> 00:00:49.780
and then in a future video

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.169
we'll dig a little bit
deeper into translation.

00:00:52.169 --> 00:00:56.336
We will translate that information
into an actual protein.

00:00:57.485 --> 00:01:00.408
But these diagrams give a
little bit of an overview of it.

00:01:00.408 --> 00:01:02.517
It's a little bit simpler in bacteria.

00:01:02.517 --> 00:01:05.759
You have the DNA just floating
around in the cytosol,

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:07.762
and so the transcription takes place.

00:01:07.762 --> 00:01:09.549
You start with that DNA,

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:12.477
that protein coding gene in the DNA,

00:01:12.477 --> 00:01:15.081
and from that you code the messenger RNA,

00:01:15.081 --> 00:01:17.467
you see that in that purple
color right over here,

00:01:17.467 --> 00:01:18.608
and then that messenger RNA

00:01:18.608 --> 00:01:20.300
can be involved with the ribosome,

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.214
and that's the translation process

00:01:22.214 --> 00:01:23.985
to actually produce the polypeptide,

00:01:23.985 --> 00:01:25.996
to produce the protein.

00:01:25.996 --> 00:01:27.381
In eukaryotic cells,

00:01:27.381 --> 00:01:28.214
and we're going to get into

00:01:28.214 --> 00:01:29.787
a little bit more depth in this video,

00:01:29.787 --> 00:01:32.704
the transcription, the DNA to mRNA,

00:01:34.112 --> 00:01:36.608
that happens inside of the nucleus.

00:01:36.608 --> 00:01:38.511
There's essentially two steps here.

00:01:38.511 --> 00:01:42.428
You go from DNA to what
we would call pre-mRNA,

00:01:44.366 --> 00:01:45.513
let me write that down,

00:01:45.513 --> 00:01:46.346
pre-mRNA,

00:01:49.798 --> 00:01:52.426
which is depicted right over there,

00:01:52.426 --> 00:01:54.702
and then it needs to be
processed to turn into

00:01:54.702 --> 00:01:56.688
what we would call mRNA,

00:01:56.688 --> 00:01:58.871
which then can leave the nucleus

00:01:58.871 --> 00:02:02.120
to be translated into a protein.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.693
So now that we have that overview,

00:02:03.693 --> 00:02:05.297
let's dig a little bit deeper into this

00:02:05.297 --> 00:02:07.217
and understand the different actors

00:02:07.217 --> 00:02:09.307
and understand if we're
talking about a eukaryotic cell

00:02:09.307 --> 00:02:13.057
what type of processing
might actually go on.

00:02:14.252 --> 00:02:15.875
So right over here,

00:02:15.875 --> 00:02:20.258
we are going to start with
the protein coding gene

00:02:20.258 --> 00:02:23.175
inside of the DNA, right over here,

00:02:25.394 --> 00:02:29.239
and the primary actor that's
not the DNA or the mRNA here

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.474
is going to be RNA polymerase.

00:02:31.474 --> 00:02:35.058
It's used to create a
sequence that will become

00:02:35.058 --> 00:02:39.225
a nucleotide sequence, that
will become the messenger RNA.

00:02:40.193 --> 00:02:43.956
So this RNA polymerase, it
needs to know where to start.

00:02:43.956 --> 00:02:47.454
The way it knows where to start
is it attaches to a sequence

00:02:47.454 --> 00:02:50.037
of the DNA known as a promoter.

00:02:51.201 --> 00:02:53.035
And every gene is going to have

00:02:53.035 --> 00:02:55.142
a promoter associated with it,

00:02:55.142 --> 00:02:57.862
especially if we're talking
about eukaryotic cells.

00:02:57.862 --> 00:03:00.623
Sometimes you might have
a promoter associated

00:03:00.623 --> 00:03:02.989
with a collection of genes as well.

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.385
But in general, if you've got a gene,

00:03:04.385 --> 00:03:05.897
you're gonna have a promoter.

00:03:05.897 --> 00:03:08.632
That's how the RNA polymerase

00:03:08.632 --> 00:03:11.937
knows to attach right over there.

00:03:11.937 --> 00:03:13.903
Once it attaches,

00:03:13.903 --> 00:03:18.252
well then, it is able
to separate the strands.

00:03:18.252 --> 00:03:19.480
It separates the strands,

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.342
and it's pretty interesting,

00:03:20.342 --> 00:03:22.316
because when we went in
deep into replication,

00:03:22.316 --> 00:03:25.381
you saw all of these actors,
the helicase and whatever else,

00:03:25.381 --> 00:03:29.113
but this RNA polymerase complex
is actually quite capable.

00:03:29.113 --> 00:03:31.036
Not only it separates the strand

00:03:31.036 --> 00:03:35.036
and then it's actually
able to code for the RNA.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:37.030
It does that the same way

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.682
that when we studied DNA polymerase,

00:03:38.682 --> 00:03:40.355
it does it in only one direction.

00:03:40.355 --> 00:03:44.036
It can only add more nucleotides
on the three prime end.

00:03:44.036 --> 00:03:45.738
So it encodes from the five prime

00:03:45.738 --> 00:03:47.440
to the three prime direction.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.273
Notice this arrow here,

00:03:48.273 --> 00:03:52.153
we're extending it on the
three prime end of the RNA.

00:03:52.153 --> 00:03:53.838
So as you can see here, when it does this,

00:03:53.838 --> 00:03:56.588
it's only encoding one side of...

00:03:58.398 --> 00:04:00.849
Or it's only interacting,
I guess you could say,

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:05.011
or coding complementary
information to one side.

00:04:05.011 --> 00:04:06.585
But let's think about this a little bit.

00:04:06.585 --> 00:04:09.335
We could call the side that it is

00:04:11.693 --> 00:04:12.947
interacting with,

00:04:12.947 --> 00:04:14.485
you can call that the template strand

00:04:14.485 --> 00:04:15.318
because

00:04:16.605 --> 00:04:18.110
that side of the DNA

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.388
is acting as the template
for forming that RNA.

00:04:21.388 --> 00:04:23.073
But if you think about the information

00:04:23.073 --> 00:04:25.598
that that RNA is actually going to encode,

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:27.738
well it's gonna contain
the same information

00:04:27.738 --> 00:04:31.734
as the coding strand of DNA,
as the other stand of DNA,

00:04:31.734 --> 00:04:34.532
because these nucleotides right over here,

00:04:34.532 --> 00:04:37.452
this nucleotide is going
to be complementary

00:04:37.452 --> 00:04:38.694
to this one over here,

00:04:38.694 --> 00:04:41.452
just as this nucleotide was complementary

00:04:41.452 --> 00:04:42.819
to that one over there.

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:44.664
And you can see it in
a little bit more depth

00:04:44.664 --> 00:04:46.969
if we actually were to
add the nucleotides.

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:48.788
So this is the template strand.

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:51.956
If you have a thymine, well on the RNA,

00:04:51.956 --> 00:04:53.406
you'd have the adenine.

00:04:53.406 --> 00:04:56.588
Look, on the coding strand
of DNA, the one up here,

00:04:56.588 --> 00:04:58.561
you would also have an adenine.

00:04:58.561 --> 00:05:01.467
Essentially the coding strand and the RNA,

00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:03.188
essentially end up
being the same sequence,

00:05:03.188 --> 00:05:04.206
but the one difference

00:05:04.206 --> 00:05:07.181
is that you won't find
the thymine in the RNA,

00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:11.098
instead you'll find a
similar nitrogenous base,

00:05:12.977 --> 00:05:14.705
and that is uracil.

00:05:14.705 --> 00:05:16.593
But uracil plays the role of thymine,

00:05:16.593 --> 00:05:19.344
so you're essentially
coding the same information.

00:05:19.344 --> 00:05:22.575
So once again, this bottom
strand is acting as a template,

00:05:22.575 --> 00:05:26.673
but it's going to be the
resulting RNA that gets coded,

00:05:26.673 --> 00:05:28.825
is essentially going to
have the same information

00:05:28.825 --> 00:05:32.105
that we had in the coding strand.

00:05:32.105 --> 00:05:35.096
Just to get an appreciation
for what this looks like,

00:05:35.096 --> 00:05:38.065
I would even write, I'd
put looks in quotations,

00:05:38.065 --> 00:05:38.910
I even did little quote things

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.501
with my fingers when I said that,

00:05:40.501 --> 00:05:42.819
is that it's hard to really visualize

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:44.113
what these things look like,

00:05:44.113 --> 00:05:47.140
but you can see here that
the RNA polymerase complex,

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.864
and this is for a specific organism,

00:05:48.864 --> 00:05:51.421
can be very, very complex and involved,

00:05:51.421 --> 00:05:54.513
and it's fascinating how
these things interact.

00:05:54.513 --> 00:05:57.937
Every time you're studying
biology and someone like me

00:05:57.937 --> 00:06:00.134
is going to give you these
nice clean narratives

00:06:00.134 --> 00:06:01.801
of how these enzymes

00:06:02.962 --> 00:06:05.051
interact with the
different macromolecules,

00:06:05.051 --> 00:06:06.642
like the DNA or the RNA,

00:06:06.642 --> 00:06:09.079
you should always
remember this is amazing.

00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:11.445
These are these molecules
interacting with each other,

00:06:11.445 --> 00:06:13.036
bouncing into each other.

00:06:13.036 --> 00:06:16.168
It's happening incredibly
fast inside of the cell.

00:06:16.168 --> 00:06:18.383
You should be in awe of this.

00:06:18.383 --> 00:06:21.300
It's happening in all of your cells

00:06:22.574 --> 00:06:24.479
or as we speak.

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:27.480
This is pretty incredible stuff.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.684
So the next thing you have to think about,

00:06:29.684 --> 00:06:32.780
this right over here, we
are extending the RNA,

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.161
well when does this thing actually stop?

00:06:35.161 --> 00:06:37.157
It stops once we...

00:06:37.157 --> 00:06:39.959
So this RNA polymerase
is going to keep going on

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:44.690
and then this blue, we've
labeled this a terminator.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.043
So let me write.

00:06:46.043 --> 00:06:47.790
So this area

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:49.680
is a terminator,

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.772
and there's multiple ways that

00:06:51.772 --> 00:06:54.340
that signals to the RNA polymerase

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.379
that "Hey, it's time to stop."

00:06:56.379 --> 00:07:00.073
More particularly, it somehow
creates something structurally

00:07:00.073 --> 00:07:02.963
that the polymerase just lets go.

00:07:02.963 --> 00:07:05.770
One mechanism, that's
depicted right over here

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.270
is that the mRNA that's coded,

00:07:11.038 --> 00:07:14.065
this could happen in bacteria,

00:07:14.065 --> 00:07:17.656
is that the mRNA that's
coded forms a hairpin.

00:07:17.656 --> 00:07:21.191
So it has to have the right
complementary base pairs,

00:07:21.191 --> 00:07:22.870
base pairs right over here,

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:23.993
to form this hairpin.

00:07:23.993 --> 00:07:26.559
This hairpin, along with the
things around the hairpin,

00:07:26.559 --> 00:07:30.726
essentially make it, impair the
polymerase to keep on going.

00:07:31.655 --> 00:07:34.079
So, the complex kind of
changes a little bit.

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:35.539
So, it let's go,

00:07:35.539 --> 00:07:36.866
or at least that's how people believe it.

00:07:36.866 --> 00:07:40.010
There's other forms of how
the terminator can act.

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:41.998
It might be sequences

00:07:41.998 --> 00:07:45.704
that parts of the
polymerase complex recognize

00:07:45.704 --> 00:07:48.807
and it makes a conformation change

00:07:48.807 --> 00:07:51.608
so that the RNA polymerase lets go.

00:07:51.608 --> 00:07:55.888
If we're talking about a
prokaryote, we're done.

00:07:55.888 --> 00:07:58.296
This would be our messenger RNA

00:07:58.296 --> 00:07:59.951
which then can go to a ribosome

00:07:59.951 --> 00:08:02.588
and then be translated into a protein.

00:08:02.588 --> 00:08:04.297
But if we're talking about a eukaryote,

00:08:04.297 --> 00:08:06.412
then we have to do a
little bit of processing.

00:08:06.412 --> 00:08:07.728
If we're talking about a eukaryote,

00:08:07.728 --> 00:08:09.697
if this is a prokaryote right over here,

00:08:09.697 --> 00:08:12.110
this would be our mRNA.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:16.528
If this is s eukaryote,
then this is our pre-mRNA,

00:08:16.528 --> 00:08:18.927
which now has to be processed.

00:08:18.927 --> 00:08:21.840
And you might say, "Well how
is that going to be processed?"

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.110
Well, there's a couple of things
that are going to be done.

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:26.167
Some things are going to
be added at the beginning

00:08:26.167 --> 00:08:28.837
and the end of the mRNA.

00:08:28.837 --> 00:08:32.780
The five prime cap, this
is a modified guanine,

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:33.613
modified

00:08:36.431 --> 00:08:37.814
guanine

00:08:37.814 --> 00:08:38.647
right over here,

00:08:38.647 --> 00:08:41.605
which is going to help in
the translation process

00:08:41.605 --> 00:08:44.731
as the ribosomes attach onto it.

00:08:44.731 --> 00:08:46.521
And then you have this poly-A tail,

00:08:46.521 --> 00:08:47.928
and it's called a poly-A tail

00:08:47.928 --> 00:08:50.735
because it has a bunch
of adenines at the end,

00:08:50.735 --> 00:08:52.340
right over here.

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:55.805
These not only help in
the translation process,

00:08:55.805 --> 00:08:59.248
it helps make sure that the
information is more robust,

00:08:59.248 --> 00:09:03.110
that the ends of the mRNA
don't in some way become,

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:04.850
or makes it less likely

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:06.724
that they're going to become damaged.

00:09:06.724 --> 00:09:08.571
Now the other thing that
needs to be processed,

00:09:08.571 --> 00:09:09.883
and this is one of
those fascinating things

00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:11.404
in evolutionary biology,

00:09:11.404 --> 00:09:14.987
is that we will have
in this mRNA sequence,

00:09:16.087 --> 00:09:17.672
you're going to have
parts of the sequence,

00:09:17.672 --> 00:09:20.886
which we currently consider
to be nonsense sequence.

00:09:20.886 --> 00:09:22.088
Nonsense sequences,

00:09:22.088 --> 00:09:24.251
and we call them introns.

00:09:24.251 --> 00:09:25.999
I'm gonna put it in quotes

00:09:25.999 --> 00:09:29.106
because in general in evolution

00:09:29.106 --> 00:09:31.886
it's seldom that things
have absolutely no purpose,

00:09:31.886 --> 00:09:35.224
but these are not coding for the protein

00:09:35.224 --> 00:09:38.329
that is going to be coded
by our initial gene.

00:09:38.329 --> 00:09:41.328
And so, these are actually processed out,

00:09:41.328 --> 00:09:42.617
they are spliced out.

00:09:42.617 --> 00:09:44.396
I'm not going to go into
the details of the actors

00:09:44.396 --> 00:09:45.990
that cause the splicing,

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:48.924
but as part of this eukaryotic processing,

00:09:48.924 --> 00:09:52.318
you add the cap, you add the tail,

00:09:52.318 --> 00:09:54.870
and then you splice out the introns,

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:56.618
and once you've spliced out the introns

00:09:56.618 --> 00:09:59.303
all you have left are the exons.

00:09:59.303 --> 00:10:01.087
So you have that.

00:10:01.087 --> 00:10:02.378
It's going to be connected to that.

00:10:02.378 --> 00:10:03.792
It's going to be connected to that.

00:10:03.792 --> 00:10:05.743
And so this is what you have resulted.

00:10:05.743 --> 00:10:09.524
This is in a eukaryote, you
will have this mature mRNA.

00:10:09.524 --> 00:10:13.066
And that's what we saw right over here

00:10:13.066 --> 00:10:14.229
that can then,

00:10:14.229 --> 00:10:16.485
let me underline that
in a color you can see,

00:10:16.485 --> 00:10:17.722
right over here,

00:10:17.722 --> 00:10:19.678
which then migrates out of the nucleus

00:10:19.678 --> 00:10:23.095
to a ribosome where it can be translated.
