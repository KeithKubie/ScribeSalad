the top but you can see and it's this is
 

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.260
the top but you can see and it's this is
so this is much easier to understand

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:07.270
so this is much easier to understand
 

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:10.529
so this is much easier to understand
than the gravitational waves and the

than the gravitational waves and the
 

00:08:10.539 --> 00:08:12.360
than the gravitational waves and the
black holes you just take images of the

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:12.370
black holes you just take images of the
 

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:15.390
black holes you just take images of the
molecules you can see them and then in

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:15.400
molecules you can see them and then in
 

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.370

00:09:50.589 --> 00:09:53.130
high-resolution atomic coordinates in
the protein databank which traditionally

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:53.140
the protein databank which traditionally
 

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:55.380
the protein databank which traditionally
had only coordinates deposited from

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:55.390
had only coordinates deposited from
 

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:57.180
had only coordinates deposited from

00:09:59.639 --> 00:09:59.649
magnetic resonance spectroscopy and you
 

00:09:59.649 --> 00:10:02.220

see back in in the 1990s and so on there

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:02.230
see back in in the 1990s and so on there
 

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:04.530

were invisible numbers of structures but

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:04.540
were invisible numbers of structures but
 

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.660
were invisible numbers of structures but
in the last five years has been a great

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:06.670
in the last five years has been a great
 

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:08.579
in the last five years has been a great
growth and it looks like this year we

00:10:08.579 --> 00:10:08.589
growth and it looks like this year we
 

00:10:08.589 --> 00:10:10.230
growth and it looks like this year we
learned that with about 700 new

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:10.240
learned that with about 700 new
 

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.569
learned that with about 700 new

of these bacteria grew the map and then

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:52.440
of these bacteria grew the map and then
 

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.920
of these bacteria grew the map and then
purified these membranes and each one of

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:55.930
purified these membranes and each one of
 

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:58.470
purified these membranes and each one of
these is a little single crystal maybe a

00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:58.480
these is a little single crystal maybe a

hundred molecules or two hundred across
 

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.900
hundred molecules or two hundred across
so 20 or 30,000 of these identical

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:03.910
so 20 or 30,000 of these identical
 

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:06.840
so 20 or 30,000 of these identical

my original plan had been to dissolve

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:11.260
my original plan had been to dissolve
 

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.350
my original plan had been to dissolve
them in detergent make 3d crystals or

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:13.360
them in detergent make 3d crystals or
 

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.560
them in detergent make 3d crystals or
analyze the 2d pattern this is an x-ray

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:16.570
analyze the 2d pattern this is an x-ray
 

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:20.220
analyze the 2d pattern this is an x-ray
powder pattern from stacks pellets of

those same membranes that you saw in

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:22.420
those same membranes that you saw in
 

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:25.890
those same membranes that you saw in
single sheets and so there are lots of

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:25.900
single sheets and so there are lots of
 

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.290
single sheets and so there are lots of
spots you can see they go out this would

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:28.300
spots you can see they go out this would
 

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.960
spots you can see they go out this would
be the one the first spot second third

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:30.970
be the one the first spot second third
 

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:32.820
be the one the first spot second third
and so on and this is about seven

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:32.830
and so on and this is about seven
 

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:34.170
and so on and this is about seven
angstrom resolution they're all very

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:34.180

strong but you can see them all going

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:35.980
strong but you can see them all going
 

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:37.500

out and you can index them right oh

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:37.510
out and you can index them right oh
 

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:39.810

right the way out to three or four

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:39.820
right the way out to three or four
 

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:41.550
right the way out to three or four
angstrom resolution so that showed that

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:41.560
angstrom resolution so that showed that
 

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.340
angstrom resolution so that showed that
these 2d crystals were really highly

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:44.350
these 2d crystals were really highly
 

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:46.590
these 2d crystals were really highly
ordered and very suitable for structural

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:46.600
ordered and very suitable for structural
 

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.870
ordered and very suitable for structural
analysis and at that point I had the

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:48.880

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:52.260

then had been determined by biochemistry
we found that you could interpret the

these structures and built a complete

00:21:16.669 --> 00:21:16.679
these structures and built a complete

was about 1990 and it was the first

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:21.330
was about 1990 and it was the first
 

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:22.850
was about 1990 and it was the first
high-resolution structure where you

could use electron microscopy to
 

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:27.799
could use electron microscopy to
determine the structures so then we went

00:21:27.799 --> 00:21:27.809
determine the structures so then we went
 

00:21:27.809 --> 00:21:32.480
determine the structures so then we went
on and did other work in the early 1990s

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:32.490
on and did other work in the early 1990s

here a very small beaker with very

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:14.650
here a very small beaker with very
 

00:42:14.650 --> 00:42:18.390
here a very small beaker with very
condensed liquid ethane and instead of

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:18.400
condensed liquid ethane and instead of
 

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:21.570
condensed liquid ethane and instead of
letting the specimen fall down in liquid

00:42:21.570 --> 00:42:21.580
letting the specimen fall down in liquid

something here and this was what this is

00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:39.880
something here and this was what this is
 

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:44.910

should they have evaporated so we

should they have evaporated so we
thought ok we will let it evaporate and

thought ok we will let it evaporate and
 

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:09.840
thought ok we will let it evaporate and
we will see what it is so we turn off

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:09.850
we will see what it is so we turn off
 

00:43:09.850 --> 00:43:12.810
we will see what it is so we turn off

explained like that we work with these

00:47:41.130 --> 00:47:41.140
explained like that we work with these
 

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:45.030
explained like that we work with these
grids and on the grids we have a thin

00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:45.040
grids and on the grids we have a thin
 

00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:50.610
grids and on the grids we have a thin
thin film and we spread the specimen on

00:47:50.610 --> 00:47:50.620
thin film and we spread the specimen on
 

00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:54.180
thin film and we spread the specimen on
the grid but this is difficult

was quite opposed to that because there

was quite opposed to that because there
 

00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:11.010
was quite opposed to that because there
is no chance but because I knew the

spreading over the whole grid so the
