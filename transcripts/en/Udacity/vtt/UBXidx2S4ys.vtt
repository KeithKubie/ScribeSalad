00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.690
Medical and research ethics have changed a lot since the time of Henrietta

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.950
Lacks. In part because of her story and other stories of research misconduct.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.020
&gt;&gt; And there have been events that have

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.510
happened all over the world not just in the

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.550
United States, that have challenged our laws and our

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.600
morals. And the question is what are the new

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.500
frontiers of genetic technology today that challenge our

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.680
morals and ethics. What are the things, 100 years

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.200
from now that we're going to look back on and

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.550
be aghast that we ever did or participated in?

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.280
&gt;&gt; Well one of the things, that's really

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.630
the forefront of people's mind is genetic discrimination.
