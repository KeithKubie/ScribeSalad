what's interesting about this work is

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180
what's interesting about this work is
 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.560
what's interesting about this work is
that intermediate waters today have been

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570
that intermediate waters today have been
 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.660
that intermediate waters today have been
warming quite a lot in the last 50 years

this with thermometers and the rate of

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:56.269
this with thermometers and the rate of
 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:58.990

of the puzzle is that the sediments in

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460
of the puzzle is that the sediments in
 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.039

Indonesia accumulate very rapidly

Indonesia accumulate very rapidly
 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:25.810
Indonesia accumulate very rapidly
because when you're always land masses

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820
because when you're always land masses
 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.490
because when you're always land masses
and that allows us to get more samples

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500
and that allows us to get more samples
 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.920
and that allows us to get more samples
per time going down core whereas a lot

by corrosive bottom waters so you can't

just do this everywhere we can only and

just do this everywhere we can only and
 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.990
just do this everywhere we can only and
we did it able here because of the

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000
we did it able here because of the
 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.570
we did it able here because of the
unique sediment record there

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580
 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.670

upwards and some of the cores we have

have annual rings that go back four or

we work on and so we collect the core

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950
we work on and so we collect the core
 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:09.810
we work on and so we collect the core
out of the top

we cut the core in half we slab it and

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040
we cut the core in half we slab it and
 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.440
we cut the core in half we slab it and
x-ray it and they grow about a

x-ray it and they grow about a
 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.020
x-ray it and they grow about a
centimeter a year and we to give you

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030
centimeter a year and we to give you

by 30 is a lot of days in the lab and
 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.400
by 30 is a lot of days in the lab and
it's such a huge amount of lab time and

it's such a huge amount of lab time and
 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.199
it's such a huge amount of lab time and

coral records because we can cross
calibrate them back in time and so our

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030
calibrate them back in time and so our
 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.550
calibrate them back in time and so our
longest record published so far goes

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560
longest record published so far goes
 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.930
longest record published so far goes
back to 1607 from Fiji and the once we

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940
back to 1607 from Fiji and the once we
 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.370
back to 1607 from Fiji and the once we
finish the Samoa record I'll probably go

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380
finish the Samoa record I'll probably go
 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.540
finish the Samoa record I'll probably go
back and 1500s
