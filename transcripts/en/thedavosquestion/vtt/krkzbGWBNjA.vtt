Hi I'm Mohamed Chebaro,
I'm the Bureau Chief, MBC-Al Arabiya television

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.120
in London.
Will the Obama administration improve the

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.080
world in 2009?
I guess the world today is at the junction

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.599
that it can-- things can only -- could only
get better.

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:24.289
And that as well the world has deceived us
before and the world did not improve.

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:30.749
Basically the economic crisis, all the troubles
around the world.

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:34.760
It's a lot for and administration, let alone
for a new president like Obama.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.219
But there is only one thing ahead and that
is human hope.

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.699
With human hope which is not high today, but,
we can look forward.

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.989
Many crisis could be challenging, economics
as one, wars, problems in the middle east.

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:55.140
I guess, more or less, if we can manage these
crisis with the Obama administration, it could

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.859
be good and show some slight improvement.
But not to put high hopes because in four

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:05.749
years, it's too short to even start resolving
even the basics of these issues.
