seen during training we found that the

seen during training we found that the

these are highly interesting questions

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190
these are highly interesting questions
 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.410
these are highly interesting questions
and I'm trying to answer them thank you
