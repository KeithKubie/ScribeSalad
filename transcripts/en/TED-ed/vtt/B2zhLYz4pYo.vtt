00:00:06.491 --> 00:00:11.887
One day in 1965, while driving to Acapulco
for a vacation with his family,

00:00:11.887 --> 00:00:17.406
Colombian journalist Gabriel García 
Márquez abruptly turned his car around,

00:00:17.406 --> 00:00:21.638
asked his wife to take care of the
family’s finances for the coming months,

00:00:21.638 --> 00:00:24.469
and returned home.

00:00:24.469 --> 00:00:28.686
The beginning of a new book 
had suddenly come to him:

00:00:28.686 --> 00:00:31.792
“Many years later, 
as he faced the firing squad,

00:00:31.792 --> 00:00:36.122
Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember 
that distant afternoon

00:00:36.122 --> 00:00:40.183
when his father took him to discover ice.”

00:00:40.183 --> 00:00:42.008
Over the next eighteen months,

00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:46.307
those words would blossom 
into One Hundred Years of Solitude.

00:00:46.307 --> 00:00:49.542
A novel that would go on 
to bring Latin American literature

00:00:49.542 --> 00:00:52.007
to the forefront 
of the global imagination,

00:00:52.007 --> 00:00:57.214
earning García Márquez 
the 1982 Nobel Prize for Literature.

00:00:57.214 --> 00:01:00.862
What makes One Hundred Years of Solitude 
so remarkable?

00:01:00.862 --> 00:01:03.831
The novel chronicles the fortunes
and misfortunes

00:01:03.831 --> 00:01:07.584
of the Buendía family 
over seven generations.

00:01:07.584 --> 00:01:10.461
With its lush, detailed sentences,

00:01:10.461 --> 00:01:14.106
large cast of characters,

00:01:14.106 --> 00:01:17.100
and tangled narrative,

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.502
One Hundred Years of Solitude 
is not an easy book to read.

00:01:21.502 --> 00:01:23.730
But it’s a deeply rewarding one,

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.613
with an epic assortment 
of intense romances,

00:01:27.613 --> 00:01:29.068
civil war,

00:01:29.068 --> 00:01:30.867
political intrigue,

00:01:30.867 --> 00:01:33.000
globe-trotting adventurers,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.677
and more characters 
named Aureliano than you’d think possible.

00:01:37.677 --> 00:01:39.994
Yet this is no mere historical drama.

00:01:39.994 --> 00:01:43.397
One Hundred Years of Solitude 
is one of the most famous examples

00:01:43.397 --> 00:01:49.089
of a literary genre 
known as magical realism.

00:01:49.089 --> 00:01:51.519
Here, supernatural events or abilities

00:01:51.519 --> 00:01:55.084
are described in a realistic 
and matter-of-fact tone,

00:01:55.084 --> 00:01:57.661
while the real events of human life 
and history

00:01:57.661 --> 00:02:01.811
reveal themselves 
to be full of fantastical absurdity.

00:02:01.811 --> 00:02:05.634
Surreal phenomena within the
fictional village of Macondo

00:02:05.634 --> 00:02:11.286
intertwine seamlessly with events taking
place in the real country of Colombia.

00:02:11.286 --> 00:02:14.529
The settlement begins 
in a mythical state of isolation,

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:17.643
but is gradually exposed 
to the outside world,

00:02:17.643 --> 00:02:20.381
facing multiple calamities along the way.

00:02:20.381 --> 00:02:23.620
As years pass, 
characters grow old and die,

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.763
only to return as ghosts,

00:02:25.763 --> 00:02:29.722
or to be seemingly reincarnated 
in the next generation.

00:02:29.722 --> 00:02:32.318
When the American fruit company 
comes to town,

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:36.931
so does a romantic mechanic who is
always followed by yellow butterflies.

00:02:36.931 --> 00:02:39.142
A young woman up and floats away.

00:02:39.142 --> 00:02:43.214
Although the novel moves forward 
through subsequent generations,

00:02:43.214 --> 00:02:46.407
time moves in an almost cyclical manner.

00:02:46.407 --> 00:02:50.183
Many characters have similar names 
and features to their forebears,

00:02:50.183 --> 00:02:52.882
whose mistakes they often repeat.

00:02:52.882 --> 00:02:56.092
Strange prophecies 
and visits from mysterious gypsies

00:02:56.092 --> 00:03:01.129
give way to the skirmishes 
and firing squads of repeated civil wars.

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.651
An American fruit company opens 
a plantation near the village

00:03:04.651 --> 00:03:07.873
and ends up massacring thousands 
of striking workers,

00:03:07.873 --> 00:03:12.733
mirroring the real-life 
‘Banana Massacre’ of 1928.

00:03:12.733 --> 00:03:15.002
Combined with the novel’s magical realism,

00:03:15.002 --> 00:03:19.065
this produces a sense 
of history as a downward spiral

00:03:19.065 --> 00:03:21.492
the characters seem powerless to escape.

00:03:21.492 --> 00:03:25.016
Beneath the magic is a story 
about the pattern of Colombian

00:03:25.016 --> 00:03:28.811
and Latin American history 
from colonial times onward.

00:03:28.811 --> 00:03:32.712
This is a history that 
the author experienced firsthand.

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:37.697
Gabriel García Márquez grew up
in a Colombia torn apart by civil conflict

00:03:37.697 --> 00:03:40.897
between its Conservative 
and Liberal political parties.

00:03:40.897 --> 00:03:43.385
He also lived in an autocratic Mexico

00:03:43.385 --> 00:03:47.991
and covered the 1958 Venezuelan 
coup d’état as a journalist.

00:03:47.991 --> 00:03:52.356
But perhaps his biggest influences 
were his maternal grandparents.

00:03:52.356 --> 00:03:57.131
Nicolás Ricardo Márquez was a
decorated veteran of the Thousand Days War

00:03:57.131 --> 00:04:01.056
whose accounts of the rebellion against
Colombia's conservative government

00:04:01.056 --> 00:04:04.883
led Gabriel García Márquez 
to a socialist outlook.

00:04:04.883 --> 00:04:09.733
Meanwhile, Doña Tranquilina Iguarán Cotes’
omnipresent superstition

00:04:09.733 --> 00:04:13.738
became the foundation 
of One Hundred Years of Solitude’s style.

00:04:13.738 --> 00:04:17.135
Their small house in Aracataca 
where the author spent his childhood

00:04:17.135 --> 00:04:20.580
formed the main inspiration for Macondo.

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.468
With One Hundred Years of Solitude,

00:04:22.468 --> 00:04:25.061
Gabriel García Márquez 
found a unique way

00:04:25.061 --> 00:04:28.144
to capture the unique history 
of Latin America.

00:04:28.144 --> 00:04:33.142
He was able to depict the strange reality 
of living in a post-colonial society,

00:04:33.142 --> 00:04:36.745
forced to relive 
the tragedies of the past.

00:04:36.745 --> 00:04:40.221
In spite of all this fatalism,
the novel still holds hope.

00:04:40.221 --> 00:04:41.823
At his Nobel Lecture,

00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:45.393
García Marquez reflected 
on Latin America’s long history

00:04:45.393 --> 00:04:48.552
of civil strife and rampant iniquity.

00:04:48.552 --> 00:04:53.452
Yet he ended the speech by affirming the
possibility of building a better world,

00:04:53.452 --> 00:04:58.090
to quote, “where no one will be able
to decide for others how they die,

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.917
where love will prove true

00:04:59.917 --> 00:05:01.772
and happiness be possible,

00:05:01.772 --> 00:05:05.198
and where the races condemned 
to one hundred years of solitude

00:05:05.198 --> 00:05:09.774
will have, at last and forever,
a second chance on earth."
