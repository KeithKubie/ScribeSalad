00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.880
Let's just talk about the
humoral response right now,

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.180
that deals with B lymphocytes.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:15.340
So B lymphocytes or B cells--
let me do them in blue.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.200
So let's say that that
is a B lymphocyte.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.720
It's a subset of white blood
cells called lymphocytes.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.360
It comes from the bone marrow
and that's where the-- well,

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.360
the B comes from bursa of
Fabricius, but we don't want

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.450
to go into detail there.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.760
But they have all of these
proteins on their surface.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.280
Actually, close to
10,000 of them.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.890
I get very excited about
B cells and I'll tell

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:36.550
you why in a second.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.390
It has all of these proteins
on them that look

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.760
something like this.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.120
I'll just draw a
couple of them.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.740
These are actually protein
complexes, you can

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:49.320
kind of view them.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.380
They actually have four separate
proteins on them and

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.215
we can call these proteins
membrane bound antibodies.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.460
And I'll talk a lot more
about antibodies.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.920
You've probably heard
the word.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.860
You have antibodies for such and
such flu, or such and such

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.800
virus, and we're going to talk
more about that in the future,

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.060
but antibodies are
just proteins.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.330
They're often referred to
as immunoglobulins.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.360
These are essentially
equivalent words.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.000
Antibodies or immunoglobulins--
and they're

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.560
really just proteins.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.640
Now, B cells have these on the
surface of their membranes.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.290
These are membrane bound.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.050
Usually when people talk about
antibodies, they're talking

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:00.140
about free antibodies that are
going to just be floating

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.260
around like that.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.410
And I'm going to go into
more detail on

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:04.770
how those are produced.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.009
Now what's really, really,
really, really, really

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.980
interesting about these membrane
bound antibodies and

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.220
these B cells in particular is
that a B cell has one type of

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.240
membrane bound antibody
on it .

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.730
It's going to also have
antibodies, but those

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.160
antibodies are going
to be different.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.920
So we'll focus on where
they're different.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.360
Let me just draw them the same
color first and then we'll

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.805
focus on where they're
different.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.840
These are both B cells.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.190
They both have these
antibodies on them.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.130
The interesting thing is that
from one B cell to another B

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:00.200
cell, they have a variable part
on this antibody that

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.780
could take on a bunch of
different forms. So this one

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.960
might look like that and that.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.720
So these long-- I'll go into
more detail on that.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.600
The fixed portion, you can
imagine is green for any kind

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.500
of antibody, and then there's
a variable portion.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.710
So maybe this guy's variable
portion is--

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:25.900
I'll do it in pink.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.520
And every one of the antibodies
bound to his

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.220
membrane are going to have that
same variable portion.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.100
This different B cell
is going to have

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.310
different variable portions.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.640
So I'll do that in a
different color.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.270
Maybe I'll do it in magenta.

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.690
So his variable portions are
going to be different.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.410
Now he has 10,000 of these on
a surface and every one of

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.170
these have the same variable
portions, but they're all

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.600
different from the variable
portions on this B cell.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.110
There's actually 10 billion
different combinations of

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.360
variable portions.

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.779
So the first question-- and I
haven't even told you what the

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:19.640
variable portions are good for--
is, how do that many

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.149
different combinations arise?

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:23.990
Obviously these proteins-- or
maybe not so obviously-- all

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.420
these proteins that are part of
most cells are produced by

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.200
the genes of that cell.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.200
So if I draw-- this
is the nucleus.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.050
It's got DNA inside
the nucleus.

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.240
This guy has a nucleus.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.360
It's got DNA inside
the nucleus.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.410
If these guys are both B cells
and they're both coming from

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.000
the same germ line, they're
coming from the same, I guess,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.180
ancestry of cells, shouldn't
they have the same DNA?

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.300
If they do have the same DNA,
why are the proteins that

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.530
they're constructing
different?

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:04.800
How do they change?

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.090
And this is why I find B cells--
and you'll see this is

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.720
also true of T cells-- to be
fascinating is, in their

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:17.940
development, in their
hematopoiesis-- that's just

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.610
the development of these
lymphocytes.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.960
At one stage in their
development, there's just a

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.990
lot of shuffling of the portion
of their DNA that

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.200
codes for here, for these
parts of the protein.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.990
There's just a lot of shuffling
that occurs.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.080
Most of when we talk about
DNA, we really want to

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.510
preserve the information, not
have a lot of shuffling.

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.110
But when these lymphocytes,
when these B cells are

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.270
maturing, at one stage of their
maturation or their

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.120
development, there's intentional
reshuffling of the

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.490
DNA that codes for this
part and this part.

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.160
And that's what leads to all
of the diversity in the

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.980
variable portions on these
membrane bound

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:59.770
immunoglobulins.

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.620
And we're about to find out why
there's that diversity.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.890
So there's tons of stuff that
can infect your body.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:12.220
Viruses are are mutating and
evolving and so are bacteria.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.490
You don't know what's going
to enter your body.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.480
So what the immune system has
done through B cells-- and

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.200
we'll also see it through T
cells-- it says, hey, let me

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.940
just make a bunch of
combinations of these things

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.470
that can essentially bind
to whatever I get to.

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:33.010
So let's say that there's
just some new virus

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.900
that shows up, right?

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:40.190
The world has never seen this
virus before this B cell,

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.940
it'll bump into this virus and
this virus won't attach.

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.750
Another B cell will bump
into this virus

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:45.740
and it won't attach.

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.370
And maybe several thousands of
B cells will bump into this

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.620
virus and it won't attach, but
since I have so many B cells

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.620
having so many different
combinations of these variable

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:59.570
portions on these receptors,
eventually one of these B

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:00.650
cells is going to bond.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:01.900
Maybe it's this one.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.620
He's going to bond to part of
the surface of this virus.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.440
It could also be to part of a
surface of a new bacteria, or

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.630
part of a surface for some
foreign protein.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:21.080
And part of the surface that it
binds on the bacteria-- so

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.050
maybe it binds on that part of
the bacteria-- this is called

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:25.300
an epitope.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:33.200
So once this guy binds to some
foreign pathogen-- and

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.730
remember, the other B cells
won't-- only the particular

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:37.790
one that had the particular
combination, one of

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:38.760
the 10 to the 10th.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.000
And actually, there aren't 10
to the 10th combinations.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.310
During their development,
they weed out all of the

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:48.760
combinations that would bind to
things that are essentially

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:52.070
you, that there shouldn't be
an immune response to.

00:07:52.070 --> 00:08:00.350
So we could say self-responding
combinations

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:02.550
weeded out.

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.950
So there actually aren't 10
to the 10th, 10 billion

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:06.690
combinations of these--
something smaller than that.

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:08.940
You have to take out all the
combinations that would have

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:12.770
bound to your own cells, but
there's still a super huge

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:15.000
number of combinations that are
very likely to bond, at

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.460
least to some part of some
pathogen of some

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.200
virus or some bacteria.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.680
And as soon as one of these B
cells binds, it says, hey

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:26.650
guys, I'm the lucky guy who
happens to fit exactly this

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:28.110
brand new pathogen.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:36.909
He becomes activated after
binding to the new pathogen.

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:39.630
And I'm going to go into more
detail in the future.

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:43.880
In order to really become
activated, you normally need

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.210
help from helper T cells,
but I don't want to

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:47.610
confuse you in the video.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:50.550
So in this case, I'm going to
assume that activation can

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:54.690
only occur-- or that it just
needs to respond, it just

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:57.080
needs to essentially
be triggered by

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.200
binding with the pathogen.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.670
In most cases, you
actually need the

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:01.785
helper T cells as well.

00:09:01.785 --> 00:09:03.420
And we'll discuss why
that's important.

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.280
It's kind of a fail
safe mechanism

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.090
for your immune system.

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:11.830
But once this guy gets
activated, he's going to start

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:13.060
cloning himself.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:17.500
He's going to say, look, I'm
the guy that can match this

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.390
virus here-- and so he's going
to start cloning himself.

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:24.810
He's going to start dividing
and repeating himself.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:28.010
So there's just going to be
multiple versions of this guy.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.240
So they all start to replicate
and they also differentiate--

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.110
differentiate means they start
taking particular roles.

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:51.350
So there's two forms
of differentiation.

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:54.100
So many, many, many hundreds
or thousands of these are

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.270
going to be produced.

00:09:55.270 --> 00:10:01.210
And then some are going to
become memory cells, which are

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:05.850
essentially just B cells that
stick around a long time with

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:09.660
the perfect receptor on them,
with the perfect variable

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.500
portion of their receptor
on them.

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:23.440
So some will be memory cells
and they're going to be in

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.140
higher quantities than
they were originally.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:28.770
So if if this guy invades our
bodies 10 years in the future,

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:31.120
they're going to have more of
these guys around that are

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:34.540
more likely to bump into them
and start and get activated

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:35.710
and then some of them
are going to turn

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:36.760
into effector cells.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.640
And effector cells are generally
cells that actually

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:39.890
do something.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:50.580
What the effector cells do is,
they turn into antibody-- they

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.050
turn into these effector B
cells-- or sometimes they're

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:55.030
called plasma cells.

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:59.175
They're going to turn into
antibody factories.

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:06.690
And the antibodies they're going
to produce are exactly

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:10.800
this combination, the date that
they originally had being

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.050
membrane bound.

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:15.230
So they're just going to start
producing these antibodies

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:19.650
that we talk about with the
exact-- they're going to start

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:22.260
spitting out these antibodies.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.670
They're going to start spitting
out tons and tons of

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:28.660
these proteins that are uniquely
able to bind to the

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:32.340
new pathogen, this new
thing in question.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:40.430
So an activated effector cell
will actually produce 2,000

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:41.590
antibodies a second.

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:43.270
So you can imagine, if you have
a lot of these, you're

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:46.290
going to have all of a sudden
a lot of antibodies floating

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:49.500
around in your body and going
into the body tissues.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.600
And the value of that and why
this is the humoral system is,

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.560
all of a sudden, you have all
of these viruses that are

00:11:54.560 --> 00:12:01.020
infecting your system, but now
you're producing all of these

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:01.820
antibodies.

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:05.680
The effector cells are these
factories and so these

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.960
specific antibodies will
start bonding.

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.510
So let me draw it like this.

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:22.370
The specific antibodies will
start bonding to these viruses

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:28.360
and that has a couple
of values to it.

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.180
One is, it essentially tags
them for pick up.

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.700
Now phagocytosis-- this is
called opsonization.

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.730
When you tag molecules for
pickup and you make them

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:51.260
easier for phagocytes to eat
them up, this is what--

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.600
antibodies are attaching and
say, hey phagocytes, this is

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:54.290
going to make it easier.

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:56.760
You should pick up these
guys in particular.

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.180
It also might make these viruses
hard to function.

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.240
I have this big thing hanging
off the side of it.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.110
It might be harder for them to
infiltrate cells and the other

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:09.110
thing is, on each of these
antibodies you have two

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:13.460
identical heavy chains
and then two

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.710
identical light chains.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:20.250
And then they have a very
specific variable portion on

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:25.450
each one and each of these
branches can bond to the

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:29.760
epitope on a virus.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.970
So you can imagine, what happens
if this guy bonds to

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:34.760
one epitope and this guy
bonds to another virus?

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.110
Then all of a sudden, these
viruses are kind of glued

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:38.950
together and that's even
more efficient.

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:40.680
They're not going to be able to
do what they normally do.

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.910
They're not going to be able
to enter cell membranes and

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:45.340
they're perfectly tagged.

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:48.650
They've been opsonized so
that phagocytes can come

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:49.520
and eat them up.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.770
So we'll talk more about B cells
in the future, but I

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:53.480
just find it fascinating that
there are that many

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:56.100
combinations and they have
enough combinations to really

00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:00.210
recognize almost anything that
can exist in the fluids of our

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:02.760
body, but we haven't solved
all of the problems yet.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.950
We haven't solved the problem
of what happens when things

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:08.060
actually infiltrate cells
or we have cancer cells?

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:11.270
How do we kill cells that have
clearly gone astray?
