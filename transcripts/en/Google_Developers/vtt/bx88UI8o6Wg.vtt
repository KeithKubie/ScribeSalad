PRADEEP NALLURI: Mutual
Mobile is a digital technology

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.190
agency where we counsel Fortune
500 companies to startups.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.580
Culture is like a
personality of the company.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.370
When we hire people, they're
not just technologists,

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.090
they also have other
facets in their life.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.460
My name is Pradeep Nalluri,
and I am general manager

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.270
at Mutual Mobile.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.420
For me, a great product is
an intersection between art,

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.721
humanities, and technology.

00:00:29.721 --> 00:00:31.220
MUSTAFA ALI: My
name is Mustafa Ali.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.442
I am the director of
technology at Mutual Mobile.

00:00:33.442 --> 00:00:35.400
We were one of the first
companies in the world

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.490
to have cross-functional teams
where you have engineers,

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.530
designers, project managers,
product owners, quality

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.140
assurance engineers all working
together to deliver a product.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.640
SAM SOLOMON: My
name is Sam, and I'm

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.020
an engineer at Mutual Mobile.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.730
When we first started working
with the Google Developers

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.690
Agency Program, it was
for me one of the biggest

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.770
things that we could do.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.960
We have Hangouts On Air,
we have several tech

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.180
sessions, knowledge transfer
sessions that Google

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.260
is providing to us.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.769
We got early access to a
host of Firebase's tools.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.960
This allowed us to offer
things to our clients that

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.730
were far beyond the scope
of what they could normally

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.980
achieve with any other agency.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.563
SPANDANA BATCHU: While working
with Bass Forecast, the product

00:01:12.563 --> 00:01:14.160
that we were using,
was announced

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.800
to be shutting down soon,
and we were all freaking out.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.290
And thanks to Developer
Agency Program,

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.210
we had access to Firebase
even before it was publicly

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.450
announced, and we were
able to quickly switch

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.857
to Firebase and deliver
the product on time.

00:01:26.857 --> 00:01:29.190
SAM SOLOMON: We did run into
some issues here and there.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.660
We needed a couple
of things to be

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.660
fixed so that we could continue
with our process as well.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.490
Having the privilege
of being a partner

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.620
has allowed us to get
those features in place.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.130
MUSTAFA ALI: Good thing about
the Early Access Program

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.860
was that it was a
two-way relationship.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.870
We got early access to
products, and, in turn,

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.930
we could give feedback,
report bugs, and help

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:46.931
make the product better.

00:01:46.931 --> 00:01:48.555
PRADEEP NALLURI: We
are in the business

00:01:48.555 --> 00:01:49.860
of selling our people's time.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.160
By actually having that
relationship with Google,

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.620
our employees are
constantly getting

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.305
the leading-edge
technology, information,

00:01:58.305 --> 00:02:01.200
they're getting trained by
the best Google developers.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.110
SAM SOLOMON: It is a force
that drives us to be better

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.670
engineers every single day.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.620
