00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.370
Annenberg Hall is
where the freshmen eat.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.420
It is the dining
hall, and that is what

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.220
it was originally built to do.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.570
It was to be the largest student
dining hall in the late 1870s,

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.010
when it first started operation.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.090
But when the houses were
established in the 1930s,

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.410
it didn't have a purpose
anymore for many years.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.470
And so it kind of
went into a decline.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.860
It wasn't very
well taken care of.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.840
It's hard for me to believe
that this wonderful building

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.600
and that wonderful space
was left almost to disuse.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.950
There's even some thought
in the 1950s of tearing down

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.240
Memorial Hall, which seems
incredible to us now, I think.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.720
And that was only reinforced
when the tower caught fire.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.220
And for many years,
Memorial Hall

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.930
had no tower until it was
restored in the late 1990s

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.180
to the glory that it now
represents on the Cambridge

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.870
and Boston skyline.
