00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.302
&gt;&gt; First things first, we need to distribute this multiplication by five to both

00:00:04.302 --> 00:00:08.658
the x and the negative two. Since in slope intercept form, y is all by itself on

00:00:08.658 --> 00:00:12.946
the left side of the equation, we're going to need to move this negative three

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:17.213
term out of the left side. So we add three to both sides, since right now it's

00:00:17.213 --> 00:00:21.514
being subtracted. And we end up with a final equation of y equals five x minus

00:00:21.514 --> 00:00:26.118
seven. So, this equation. In our earlier equation should be equivalent or rather

00:00:26.118 --> 00:00:30.376
these should be equations that graph exactly the same line. To make sure that

00:00:30.376 --> 00:00:34.530
this equation fits the information that we used to create the equation end

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.847
points slope form, let's see if the point we started are with lies on this line.

00:00:38.847 --> 00:00:43.100
We can already tell that the slope of this line is 5. So that gets rid of one of

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.936
our criteria. let's check each side of this equation done with the point 2, 3.

00:00:47.936 --> 00:00:52.344
One the left hand side we have y, and substituting in our value for y, we have

00:00:52.344 --> 00:00:56.688
3. So the left hand side gives us 3. Now what about the right hand side? The

00:00:56.688 --> 00:01:01.299
expression on the right hand side of the equation is 5x minus 7. Let's see what

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:05.801
that is equivalent to when we plug in our point. So you substitute 2 in for x.

00:01:05.801 --> 00:01:10.070
And for this side of the equation we also end up with 3. Since our left hand

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.276
side and our right hand side match each other, we plug in our information. We're

00:01:14.276 --> 00:01:17.962
good to go. We have confirmed that this equation fits our information.
