Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.

2
00:00:02.651 --> 00:00:07.651
This is Radiolab and our subject today is cities and if cities are like

3
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.800
organisms, then one thing we should say about every organism that's ever been,

4
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.060
they die. Yeah, they die. So you would think cities would die, you would,

5
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.590
<v 1>but Jonah says no, cities die very,</v>

6
00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:24.591
very rarely and they almost never die if there hasn't been a total total

7
00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:27.270
catastrophe. Physical catastrophe, which is weird,

8
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.290
you know if you think about it says Jonah cause like take a company and

9
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.990
sometimes it can get very big so that they include hundreds of thousands of

10
00:00:33.991 --> 00:00:36.720
employees and yet they die all the time.

11
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.940
Of the 30 companies in the original Dow Jones,

12
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.130
only three are still in the Dow Jones Index.

13
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.220
If you took 30 cities from the 1920s I can guarantee you all 30 of those

14
00:00:46.221 --> 00:00:50.360
randomly selected cities would still exist on the map. And the question is why?

15
00:00:50.361 --> 00:00:53.900
Why don't they die like every other social organization?

16
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.740
What is it about cities that gives them this crazy persistence?

17
00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.050
<v 0>That question led us to a place the by all measures should have died long ago.</v>

18
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.390
A place called Centralia.

19
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.230
Okay, so we begin on the side of where are we?

20
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.150
We're on route 61 in eastern Pennsylvania. Right. This is bad by the way.

21
00:01:17.151 --> 00:01:21.280
He's a producer at radio lab. I know who pat is. Thank you very much Danielle.

22
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.370
We're waiting for this guy named Tom to meet up with us. Tom.

23
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.230
Tom [inaudible] asked me, are you doing, I'm jet

24
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.020
just now. And we had asked Tom to show us around his town,

25
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.290
probably the best place that goes up on the hill up there and you know,

26
00:01:36.291 --> 00:01:38.030
you could look over everything. Okay,

27
00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.370
so we go up on the hill with Tom. We actually meet up with another Tom Dempsey.

28
00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.270
I was the former postmaster to Tom's. Tom. Tom, very confusing. Anyhow,

29
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.700
the four of us stare down into a valley that used to have a town in it.

30
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.340
Front of house was all, it was all streets with homes on them all over.

31
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.020
Now Centralia is just trees right down here was the

32
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.090
Tom two point system trees borough high school over here.

33
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.530
No more trees, bedding,

34
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.030
Nike's church are still [inaudible] playground right at the bottom of this

35
00:02:13.031 --> 00:02:15.280
little hill right here. You can still see the bars.

36
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.080
This is where things get a little strange.

37
00:02:17.081 --> 00:02:21.190
I mean right next to the swing set where kids used to laugh their little heads

38
00:02:21.191 --> 00:02:22.990
off. There's a hole in the ground right there.

39
00:02:22.991 --> 00:02:27.991
I can see some steam coming out of the ground spewing steam and that and I would

40
00:02:28.011 --> 00:02:31.910
later discover and we got close to it that that steam is really hot.

41
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.310
It's hot and wet. Oh my God. Huh?

42
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.240
What? Where exactly is the fire underneath this?

43
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.490
Like how far here? 50 feet maybe. So 50 feet down.

44
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.820
If it is cast you, the smell doesn't bother you guys. What smell?

45
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.030
You can smell it. It smells like burning tires here.

46
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.010
That must be from New York. That stuck in your nose. Come on.

47
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.560
It really did smell put the thing. No one can denies that.

48
00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:06.880
Underneath our feet there's a web of coal mines that stretches from miles 40

49
00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:07.810
miles in each direction,

50
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:12.580
30 miles and somewhere in those mines is a fire that's been burning for 40 years

51
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.620
and has either destroyed this town or not depending on who you ask.

52
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.030
Uh, this is pat right here. My name is Mary Lou Gaughan. I'm ready.

53
00:03:23.031 --> 00:03:26.300
Two years old and I lived in Centralia most of my adult life.

54
00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.080
What year were you born in, if you mind me asking, what year was I born? 1927.

55
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.320
Mary Lou gon grew up in a town not too far from Centralia.

56
00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.480
Amy Little Farm town called Burnsville.

57
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.710
And when she got to central Iowa she said, well I was like moving to the city.

58
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.040
It had a legion, had a drug store, it had that,

59
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.060
it had a couple thousand people, lots of bars was in center head.

60
00:03:47.061 --> 00:03:49.700
Somebody told me one time they were 22 browns in Centralia.

61
00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.040
I don't know if that was true cause I didn't frequent.

62
00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.580
Byron's at that age and all these places that you just mentioned were right on

63
00:03:55.581 --> 00:03:57.680
top of each other. So when you were walking around,

64
00:03:57.681 --> 00:04:00.670
you'd see people all the time just take, for instance, you'd go there,

65
00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.800
the post office after work where the post office was,

66
00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.330
Tommy would be there sometimes. I was postmaster here for a number of years.

67
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.300
Tweet. You're pointing into a forest. It's hard to imagine.

68
00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.660
It is hard to imagine and yet I walk to the post office cause your mail wasn't

69
00:04:14.661 --> 00:04:16.580
delivered. So I'd go up to the post office,

70
00:04:16.581 --> 00:04:19.580
I get my mail and you'd meet people in the post office.

71
00:04:19.581 --> 00:04:23.800
You'd meet people coming out of the post office, a good football field here.

72
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.000
It's all growing and nobody's cutting the grass.

73
00:04:26.001 --> 00:04:28.790
There's bushes growing up in it now, Tommy Dempsey, you'd have a story.

74
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.240
I would be an hour till I got home. Whole hour.

75
00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.890
This is how Centralia was. Okay. Fast forward,

76
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.960
it's Memorial Day 1962 this is where the borrowers picked up all their garbage.

77
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.970
That if our other store that just about right here where I'm standing right now,

78
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.140
tell me points to a little patch of nondescript yellow grass.

79
00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.340
Like why here? How did it start? Do we have any idea? Well,

80
00:04:55.341 --> 00:04:58.070
it started the most likely scenario. He says,

81
00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.350
we also heard this from a writer named Joan Quigley,

82
00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.800
author of the day the Earth captain is it people used to heat their homes with

83
00:05:03.801 --> 00:05:06.740
coal and maybe somebody threw their ashes into the garbage,

84
00:05:06.741 --> 00:05:09.530
which then ended up onto the dump. They caught the whole thing on fire,

85
00:05:09.531 --> 00:05:13.730
furniture, rugs, kerosene cans, which Joan says wasn't that unusual?

86
00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.380
Some of the former firefighters said the dumps caught on fire all the time and

87
00:05:18.381 --> 00:05:21.140
usually the virus just fizzled out on their own. But this one,

88
00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.160
for whatever reason before it did wandered a little bit and it found its way

89
00:05:25.161 --> 00:05:28.880
over to an old exposed, exposed Colver in there.

90
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.570
Basically an old strip mine that should have been covered but wasn't so there

91
00:05:32.571 --> 00:05:36.460
was just a big open cavity. When the fire got in there and call the

92
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.350
fire trucks came up here and they hose down to fire. To look out.

93
00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.650
It was that and they left following Betty. Somebody says all,

94
00:05:45.651 --> 00:05:47.990
we see smoke and steam coming out of the ground up there.

95
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.800
Came back the next day and they tried to get the fire out and I couldn't very

96
00:05:51.801 --> 00:05:55.640
well do it. They weren't getting it cause at that point it was two legs.

97
00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.090
I wouldn't know where to start with this fire. I wouldn't know where to start.

98
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.880
The first place that fire came down was right underneath Mary Lou's house and

99
00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.030
from that point on they kind of took over her life like goodness is your

100
00:06:08.031 --> 00:06:09.480
scrapbooks. When we were there,

101
00:06:09.481 --> 00:06:13.040
she pulled out these two gigantic scrapbooks.

102
00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.670
It's going to take four men to lift this book.

103
00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:19.530
Each book is literally three feet tall and they document in painful detail how

104
00:06:19.531 --> 00:06:21.300
that fires split the town and to,

105
00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.930
this is how intense I was with this mindful fire that she heaved,

106
00:06:24.931 --> 00:06:29.040
opened the book and she showed us this picture of three people crouched on the

107
00:06:29.041 --> 00:06:31.460
street in front of a whole, this is my husband,

108
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.870
my son and me and husband holding a thermometer.

109
00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:38.310
We dropped this down on like a fishing pole down on like you're ice fishing.

110
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.190
Yeah. This is their way of measuring the temperature of the fire and below.

111
00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.610
What did they read? It was pretty high. A hundred degrees high.

112
00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.230
850 something under your house? No, this was on the street,

113
00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.830
but the street right in front of her house and the garage was,

114
00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.710
the garage was right as you can see, that garage here, it was right there.

115
00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.280
She showed us another picture of her standing in her garage in front of a trench

116
00:06:59.281 --> 00:07:03.000
that they'd dug in inside that trench. You see flames.

117
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.310
We used to go out at night and watch there that, you know,

118
00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:09.930
the glowing and the embers fire up there got so bad that some of Mary Lou's

119
00:07:09.931 --> 00:07:13.650
neighbors actually got government money to leave their houses named where the

120
00:07:13.651 --> 00:07:17.580
first people bought out. Never once, like at the beginning did you think like,

121
00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:21.210
oh, maybe we should just get outta here. No, there's a fire a hundred yards.

122
00:07:21.211 --> 00:07:26.160
You never know. I never went to. Instead, she did exactly the opposite.

123
00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:29.580
My husband, and this was a big official and this was the beginner heals,

124
00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:34.620
started writing letters, men, Nelligan Musto. We wrote letters to him.

125
00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:35.970
We talked on the phone with him.

126
00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:39.330
I couldn't tell you all the congressman we talked the four governors,

127
00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.600
all the Harrisburg officials, and they were promising everything but the son.

128
00:07:42.601 --> 00:07:46.530
But it never happened. But other than that, people who lived on that street,

129
00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:47.491
many,

130
00:07:47.491 --> 00:07:52.320
many people in town didn't have to worry or even think about the mind fire.

131
00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:56.120
No one ever believed that the fire was, was even serious in some tried yet.

132
00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:59.550
My husband, myself and Helen Rumor, oh, so everyone else was kind of like,

133
00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:05.250
it's uptown and if fire is uptown, all that changed on Valentine's Day,

134
00:08:05.251 --> 00:08:08.730
1981 we're up a little bit hotter because of this guy.

135
00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:12.060
A fellow named Todd Demboski, who at the time was just a boy.

136
00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:16.080
I was 1212 year old boy. He's playing outside in his grandmother's backyard.

137
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:21.120
I noticed the small wisps of smoke coming out with the ground.

138
00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:25.890
So he went over to take a look. I was like, I bent down to investigate.

139
00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:28.770
I noticed that my feet were starting to sink in.

140
00:08:28.771 --> 00:08:32.980
It was really soft and it was like quicksand. The more I tried to struggle,

141
00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:33.720
the more, ah,

142
00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:37.950
I was just opening the whole larger and you wound up sliding through my thighs

143
00:08:37.951 --> 00:08:39.900
to my waist until he was,

144
00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:45.380
I was under all the way underground surrounded by hot steam.

145
00:08:45.661 --> 00:08:48.900
Smoke was so intense. Smells like rotten eggs.

146
00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:55.910
While I was screaming for my cousin and his cousin heard him and came running

147
00:08:55.951 --> 00:08:58.050
over, blocked me out like a flower.

148
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:02.970
What happened to him? Changed everything

149
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.660
because suddenly reporters are everywhere. Reporters from the evening,

150
00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.950
Harold's lines, national news media, everybody pointing their cameras at Todd

151
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:17.430
chief was the mind firing when I did.

152
00:09:17.431 --> 00:09:21.130
I just fell right through and doing stories about this town that was on fire and

153
00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.970
he Centralia the underground coal fires still burn.

154
00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:29.670
Hoshan Trillia isn't inferno parts of Centralia look like the outskirts of hell

155
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.820
would focus on what had to happen for the town.

156
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.270
There wasn't long says Joan before. Some of the younger residents, small,

157
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:39.600
informal group of young parents organized in March,

158
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.910
found locus to have anybody down the main street in town.

159
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.440
How many people are we talking about here?

160
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.190
Couple of dozen with red ribbons around their arms and their wrists and they

161
00:09:47.191 --> 00:09:51.450
walked two by two down the main street of Centralia like striking miners.

162
00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:55.530
Mary Lou glared at them as they passed. I was bitter.

163
00:09:55.531 --> 00:09:59.670
I was bitter with they claim they were for helping the town to be saved,

164
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:03.180
but they weren't what they were really for. She figured was getting out there,

165
00:10:03.181 --> 00:10:05.730
look for funds to get relocated. She even hated their name,

166
00:10:05.731 --> 00:10:08.970
concerned citizens against the Centralia mine fire. She thought,

167
00:10:08.971 --> 00:10:11.970
how are they the concern citizens, she's the concerned citizen.

168
00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.650
She had been fighting the fire for years.

169
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.860
The media was there taking video cameras, film the marchers,

170
00:10:16.861 --> 00:10:19.590
looping red ribbon over everything and Mary Lou's neighbor,

171
00:10:19.591 --> 00:10:24.360
Helen cut the red room and stem because we fought so hard to try to save

172
00:10:24.361 --> 00:10:28.800
Centralia. Why did they want to do this? People like Mary Lou and Helen Willmar.

173
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.320
They started telling people, no, no, no. Here's why it's safe.

174
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:35.040
Here's why you should say and what parents from the other group were on TV

175
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:39.570
complaining about gases. It could be a death house. Mary Lou,

176
00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.300
Helen and a few others started up their own committee and I didn't.

177
00:10:42.301 --> 00:10:44.370
Centralia area mine task force.

178
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.190
They got on TV themselves and in the community they started printing up flyers,

179
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:53.370
sac sheets and handing them out door to door. Okay. On a college meeting,

180
00:10:53.371 --> 00:10:54.810
daughter at town meetings,

181
00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:59.460
the dueling committees would get up there and make their case get yelled down,

182
00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:03.690
not protect us. They get rowdy, absolutely ridiculous.

183
00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:07.110
Families fighting against families, neighbors against neighbors.

184
00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:10.710
There's lambing split the town apart. Who's that? David Lamb.

185
00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:11.820
This Guy David Lamb,

186
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.630
ran a motorcycle shop in town and he was also a member of this concerned

187
00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:16.973
citizens organization.

188
00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:21.480
Early morning in one morning at about 4:00 AM he was sleeping in an apartment

189
00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:26.610
and someone threw a Molotov cocktail, threw his plate glass window.

190
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:31.140
Mary Lou showed us an article from a scrapbook related to lamps activities as an

191
00:11:31.141 --> 00:11:35.370
officer of concerned citizens. Wow, this is no joke.

192
00:11:35.371 --> 00:11:38.760
This is like the Sopranos or worse. This was really,

193
00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.820
it was really bad and in the midst of all this chaos,

194
00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:45.210
Congress started considering a bill that would basically let them buy out the

195
00:11:45.211 --> 00:11:48.960
town. Some observers believe that for about $50 million, some truck,

196
00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:53.410
it could be totally bought out until the mayor decided let's hold a referendum

197
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.560
and the issue was stay or go. In the weeks leading up to the referendum,

198
00:11:56.561 --> 00:11:59.500
Mary Lou and Helen again went door to door talking to people.

199
00:11:59.501 --> 00:12:02.620
They'd known their whole lives and pretty much everyone they talked to said,

200
00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:05.020
I really want to stay. My mother wants to stay.

201
00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:06.420
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

202
00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:08.250
<v 0>August 11th,</v>

203
00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:11.910
1983 shortly before 10 of the seed banks and he mayor announced the results,

204
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.200
there is 545 votes. Votes cast,

205
00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:19.950
200 voted to stay.

206
00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:25.740
345 voted to relocate. I was crying.

207
00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:29.670
Yes in my heart. I never thought that would happen ever.

208
00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:31.430
You thought that everybody would,

209
00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:36.760
Wednesday maybe 40 people might decide or maybe 30 but that was devastating to

210
00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:42.750
know that so many people wanted to move. It was.

211
00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:47.500
And when you look at her scrapbooks, everything stops after that day. Yeah.

212
00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:51.530
This is just thrown in papers. Wow. It just stopped so abruptly. Yup.

213
00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:55.950
I was always mad and disgusted and I didn't want to,

214
00:12:56.010 --> 00:13:00.210
I didn't want to do it no more about it. That was the end.

215
00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.730
Almost immediately after that vote, Congress bought out the town.

216
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.700
People started packing up and leaving. Oh, let me see where it is. I have some,

217
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:10.550
it has the big numbers that ready. Lou told us that when you decided to leave,

218
00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:14.630
a demolition crew would actually come to your house and paint big red letters

219
00:13:14.631 --> 00:13:15.464
like this.

220
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:19.460
A big number one in front of your house look like blood was dripping up. Oh,

221
00:13:19.461 --> 00:13:21.650
it's like you were marked. Yeah. And what would happen,

222
00:13:21.651 --> 00:13:24.260
she says when your house was marked is that your neighbors would see it.

223
00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:27.890
They'd get nervous and then suddenly their houses would be marked and then

224
00:13:27.891 --> 00:13:29.450
suddenly the whole block would be marked.

225
00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:33.200
And I knew every one of them quite well and I think I stopped talking to some of

226
00:13:33.201 --> 00:13:36.380
them. She'd see him on the street, she says, and look the other way.

227
00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:37.850
I didn't like any of them really.

228
00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:43.340
And one day in the fall of 1987 these divisions caused something to happen that

229
00:13:43.341 --> 00:13:46.670
is just kind of like mythically bad. Yeah.

230
00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:50.210
It involved a married couple who'd been in the town most.

231
00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:54.140
She'd been there her whole life and as a couple they were divided.

232
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.240
One wanted to stay, one wanted to go.

233
00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:58.610
I think it was the wife I didn't want to leave.

234
00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.130
And the husband while he was a shovel runner and he,

235
00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:04.970
he wanted to take the money you get from your location and get out there.

236
00:14:04.971 --> 00:14:06.290
Neighbors were moving,

237
00:14:06.291 --> 00:14:11.060
had moved the houses around them were being torn down and they had to make a

238
00:14:11.061 --> 00:14:16.061
decision and all we really know is that at some point they started to argue and

239
00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:17.930
um, and it escalated.

240
00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:24.160
He stopped her to death with a kitchen knife and then drove up to an old

241
00:14:24.261 --> 00:14:27.200
stripping pit and set himself in his car on fire.

242
00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:29.453
<v 2>Wow.</v>

243
00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:33.400
<v 0>Is, this is going to sound like a strange question,</v>

244
00:14:33.401 --> 00:14:35.590
but is there anything about that that makes sense to you?

245
00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:39.550
Like why couldn't people let go of this place?

246
00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:44.910
It is very primal. Beyond that,

247
00:14:44.911 --> 00:14:49.911
she really couldn't say why and we asked Mary Lou who hung on long after the

248
00:14:50.461 --> 00:14:54.920
murder, after that referendum, after the town was basically empty.

249
00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:59.030
I have no idea what kept me there. I have no idea. You have no idea.

250
00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:03.240
No idea. I just didn't want to move the other street

251
00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:07.520
[inaudible] houses down there. Yeah. Now today,

252
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:10.820
11 people live in town as was better than his wife. Yeah, man.

253
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:12.910
My mom and them lived down to the intersection.

254
00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:16.430
Tom and Tom pointed them all out from the hill. We knocked on every door,

255
00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:21.140
figured we asked them what it is that keeps them living literally on top of a

256
00:15:21.141 --> 00:15:24.410
fire. Hi, good evening.

257
00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.660
Wow. That was the shortest, but none of them wanted to talk to us.

258
00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:34.790
Not even the dogs. Oh, okay. All right.

259
00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:39.090
But then Tom too took us to one last spot.

260
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:44.420
Where are we right now? You're in San Ignatius, Roman Catholic cemetery.

261
00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:48.830
The cemetery is just a few feet away from the hill where we started.

262
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.720
And it's a really strange contrast.

263
00:15:50.721 --> 00:15:55.040
You go from the steamy hell and then suddenly you're in like,

264
00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:58.400
what's he Vermont? There's a lot of big beautiful, um,

265
00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:03.320
this is my grandfather and my grandmother. Tom has four generations buried here.

266
00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:06.330
Do you know how many people are here? Tom? Odd.

267
00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:11.590
There's over 3000 burials in this cemetery along 3000. Yes.

268
00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.060
Plus, and the thing is, as Tom,

269
00:16:14.061 --> 00:16:19.061
even the people that left fled that fire continue to come back and be buried in

270
00:16:19.281 --> 00:16:22.130
this cemetery, which means this place,

271
00:16:22.131 --> 00:16:25.640
the cemetery is the only thing in Centralia that's still growing.

272
00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:29.320
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

273
00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:33.520
<v 0>and suddenly how Joan put it earlier, it is very primal made sense.</v>

274
00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:39.360
You can experience your life on a multigenerational plate.

275
00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:44.020
This is where my great grandparents are buried, which means in a sense,

276
00:16:44.021 --> 00:16:47.500
this town will never die as long as the cemetery is still here.

277
00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:50.590
I don't even read their name on this here. This dig it up. Oh,

278
00:16:50.591 --> 00:16:51.670
it's under the dirt.

279
00:16:55.890 --> 00:17:00.470
<v 3>Do we get this up by somehow</v>

280
00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:03.110
see

281
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:06.860
<v 0>it sinking down into the ground. But it's in the, it's in the dirt. No. Yes, it,</v>

282
00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.780
and here we go. We can see a dem has t y s

283
00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:14.840
y thinks about Walters for reporting that with me.

284
00:17:14.841 --> 00:17:19.550
And also to Chris Perkel and Georgie Roland who directed a great documentary

285
00:17:19.551 --> 00:17:21.830
about Centralia called the town that was,

286
00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:24.770
you can find out more information about that on our website.
