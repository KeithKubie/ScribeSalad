&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Our two terms are x times the quantity x plus 2 and 3 times the quantity x

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.161
plus 2. Both of these have a factor of x plus 2 in them. So we can pull that

00:00:11.161 --> 00:00:17.463
outside. And what's left over? Well, an x and added to that a 3. Awesome. That's

00:00:17.463 --> 00:00:18.391
our answer.
