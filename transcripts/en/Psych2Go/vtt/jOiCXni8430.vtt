00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:09.285
Anxiety disorders affect nearly 20

00:00:09.285 --> 00:00:12.425
percent of adults in North America. That's about 40

00:00:12.425 --> 00:00:13.675
million people.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.605
When we're feeling anxious or stressed, sometimes

00:00:16.605 --> 00:00:19.660
it feels good to go home and indulge in some well deserved

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.495
vices. We've all planted our butts in our couches

00:00:22.495 --> 00:00:25.105
and binge watched our favorite shows while eating pizza.

00:00:25.455 --> 00:00:28.175
But as tempting as that sounds, is it really

00:00:28.175 --> 00:00:31.355
the best thing for us? And as it turns out,

00:00:31.355 --> 00:00:34.355
some of our guilty pleasures may be agitating our

00:00:34.355 --> 00:00:37.335
anxiety instead of reducing it. Here are 8

00:00:37.335 --> 00:00:40.525
everyday habits that may be stressing you out more than you know.

00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:43.405
Number 1: Being a Couch Potato

00:00:43.545 --> 00:00:46.595
When you spend all day huddled up in bed or on your sofa,

00:00:46.595 --> 00:00:49.345
you give up the chance to decrease your tension,

00:00:49.345 --> 00:00:51.460
improve your sleep, and stabilize your mood.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.380
Yes, your daily activeness has a direct affect on your mood.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.615
Regular exercise is important in maintaining your

00:00:58.615 --> 00:01:01.685
mental health because it reduces stress. Just 10 minutes

00:01:01.685 --> 00:01:04.685
of exercise a day can improve your alertness and concentration.

00:01:04.685 --> 00:01:07.735
Number 2: Do you skip meals

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.740
because you're too busy being out and about? You're only causing

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.755
your body stress. When you don't

00:01:12.755 --> 00:01:14.885
have enough to eat, your blood sugar levels take a dive;

00:01:14.885 --> 00:01:17.855
making you feel anxious, sluggish, and irritated.

00:01:18.005 --> 00:01:20.845
Want to feel calm and happy? Eat foods like

00:01:20.845 --> 00:01:22.235
berries, spinach, and fish.

00:01:22.725 --> 00:01:25.735
All these foods and their nutrients work towards the elevation

00:01:25.735 --> 00:01:28.425
of mood and the warding off of depression.

00:01:28.425 --> 00:01:30.735
Number 4: Coffee Addiction

00:01:31.465 --> 00:01:34.765
Caffeine is no friend to anyone who is prone to anxiety.

00:01:34.895 --> 00:01:37.775
Caffeine stimulates our fight or flight response centers

00:01:37.775 --> 00:01:40.665
mimicking our physiological reactions to dangerous

00:01:40.665 --> 00:01:43.215
or scary situations. This makes us feel alert

00:01:43.215 --> 00:01:45.735
and energized. But this simulation

00:01:45.735 --> 00:01:48.665
also means that we have to deal with fight or flight symptoms.

00:01:48.665 --> 00:01:50.415
Increased heart rate, sweaty palms,

00:01:50.415 --> 00:01:53.265
an upset stomach, and shaky hands.

00:01:53.265 --> 00:01:56.165
A good alternative that can wake us up in the morning is a cold glass of water

00:01:56.165 --> 00:01:59.025
with lemon or cucumber. Or both if you're feeling

00:01:59.025 --> 00:02:00.025
festive.

00:02:00.335 --> 00:02:03.475
Number 5: Scrolling Through Social Media

00:02:03.525 --> 00:02:05.945
It's a common habit to scroll through your Instagram

00:02:05.945 --> 00:02:08.945
or Facebook in our free time. But being on social media

00:02:08.945 --> 00:02:11.015
can take time away from other more important

00:02:11.015 --> 00:02:14.115
things. Like being present at work or getting tasks done.

00:02:14.215 --> 00:02:17.135
The realization that you've spent 20 minutes looking at your Instagram feed

00:02:17.135 --> 00:02:19.375
can lead to regret and anxiety

00:02:19.375 --> 00:02:20.985
for not using your time more productively.

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:25.035
Being able to look at the best parts of other people's lives online

00:02:25.035 --> 00:02:27.355
can often make us feel jealous and upset about our own lives.

00:02:28.105 --> 00:02:30.625
Unplug for a while. Focus on people

00:02:30.625 --> 00:02:33.385
in front of you and spend time with friends and loved ones.

00:02:33.405 --> 00:02:36.045
Those are the interactions that help you feel happy.

00:02:36.625 --> 00:02:39.635
Number 6: You Don't Get Sleep.

00:02:39.635 --> 00:02:41.845
You need at least 7 hours of sleep in order to

00:02:41.845 --> 00:02:44.440
feel healthy and energized in the day.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.340
Anything less, and you'll feel the effects of sleep deprivation.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.415
These effects include heightened stress, mood destabilization,

00:02:50.415 --> 00:02:53.335
poor cognitive functioning, and lowered immune system.

00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:56.035
Sleep deprivation can also cause anticipatory

00:02:56.035 --> 00:02:58.995
anxiety, which is the anxiety you feel right before

00:02:58.995 --> 00:03:01.285
events like heading into work, having to speak publicly,

00:03:01.285 --> 00:03:03.715
or taking a test.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.765
Are you a habitual pre-sleep computer or phone user?

00:03:06.765 --> 00:03:10.020
These over-stimulating gadgets are preventing your brain from

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.985
winding down. Try reading a book before bed, or

00:03:12.985 --> 00:03:15.765
better yet, pre-sleep breathing meditation.

00:03:18.465 --> 00:03:21.535
Number 7: Spending Too Much Time Alone

00:03:22.215 --> 00:03:23.485
This might not seem

00:03:23.485 --> 00:03:26.625
productive for someone who suffers from anxiety, but spending time

00:03:26.625 --> 00:03:29.665
with other people can help to alleviate symptoms of anxiety.

00:03:29.665 --> 00:03:32.165
Spending time with supportive friends

00:03:32.165 --> 00:03:35.035
and developing healthy, positive attachments can help to

00:03:35.035 --> 00:03:37.935
improve social functioning and increase happiness.

00:03:37.935 --> 00:03:40.175
Alone time is important every once in a while,

00:03:40.175 --> 00:03:43.235
especially for all you introverts out there, but it's

00:03:43.235 --> 00:03:46.145
just as important to get out there and to see your friends.

00:03:46.855 --> 00:03:50.225
Number 8: Listening to Moody Music

00:03:51.055 --> 00:03:53.995
Yes, sad songs can affect your mood.

00:03:53.995 --> 00:03:56.865
The emotion and affect of the songs you listen to have direct

00:03:56.865 --> 00:03:58.585
effects on your current emotions.

00:03:59.755 --> 00:04:01.745
If you're already feeling anxious or sad,

00:04:01.745 --> 00:04:05.235
it's probably not in your best interest to play your breakup playlist (idk)

00:04:05.895 --> 00:04:08.385
That sad tune will exacerbate the sadness

00:04:08.385 --> 00:04:11.315
and anxiety you may already be feeling.

00:04:11.315 --> 00:04:14.595
The next time you're feeling sad or anxious, listen to something happy.

00:04:14.705 --> 00:04:17.835
Make a playlist full of calming or positive music that will

00:04:17.835 --> 00:04:19.845
help you find your happy place.

00:04:20.205 --> 00:04:23.175
Now remember, these habits are not surefire anxiety

00:04:23.175 --> 00:04:24.175
triggers for everyone.

00:04:24.565 --> 00:04:27.735
Doing any of these things will not guarantee a bout of anxiety,

00:04:28.245 --> 00:04:29.815
but they will increase your chances

00:04:31.115 --> 00:04:32.115
What do you think?

00:04:32.305 --> 00:04:34.815
Any anxiety inducing habits you've been guilty of?

00:04:35.745 --> 00:04:38.565
Are there any habits you know of that should have made it on the list?
