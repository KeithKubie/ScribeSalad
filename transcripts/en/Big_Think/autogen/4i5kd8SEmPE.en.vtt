I actually first started thinking about

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:02.689
I actually first started thinking about
 

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:07.099
I actually first started thinking about
information as a possible glimmer of an

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109
information as a possible glimmer of an
 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.950
information as a possible glimmer of an
idea for a subject for a book when I was

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960
idea for a subject for a book when I was
 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.330
idea for a subject for a book when I was
working on chaos that's when I first

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340
working on chaos that's when I first
 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.620
working on chaos that's when I first
heard about it and it was strange I was

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630
heard about it and it was strange I was
 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.470
heard about it and it was strange I was
strange to hear about information theory

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480
strange to hear about information theory
 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.560

chaos theory I mean they were analyzing

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369
chaos theory I mean they were analyzing
 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.200
chaos theory I mean they were analyzing
a physical system in fact it was chaos

that that's what we get when we start to

that that's what we get when we start to
treat information as something that is

not necessarily meaningful because as

not necessarily meaningful because as
