00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.130
Let's use a number line to show
my overdrawn bank balance.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:11.830
If I start here at $-20 and
then I add -15 to that,

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.885
I can see that I move further away
from 0 all the way over to -35.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.150
We can see that when we add
a negative number on the number line,

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.380
we move toward the left.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.434
Which direction do we move when we add
a positive number on the number line?

00:00:27.434 --> 00:00:28.500
Please select one.
