00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.688
- [Mark] I also got a curry with tendon.

00:00:02.688 --> 00:00:04.837
Oh, that looks fantastic.

00:00:04.837 --> 00:00:09.004
Okay, I'll get a little bit
of everything in this bite.

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:12.879
(light music)

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:16.527
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:16.527 --> 00:00:19.994
It's Mark Wiens with
migrationology.com in Hong Kong.

00:00:19.994 --> 00:00:22.435
Ying and I didn't have
the best sleep last night.

00:00:22.435 --> 00:00:26.029
We woke up at about 2:30 am
and have been awake since,

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:27.971
but that's not because
the bed isn't comfortable,

00:00:27.971 --> 00:00:31.155
the bed is ridiculously
comfortable, it's like a cloud,

00:00:31.155 --> 00:00:34.043
but just due to the
traveling and the jet lag.

00:00:34.043 --> 00:00:38.464
But the good news is it is
a fresh day in Hong Kong.

00:00:38.464 --> 00:00:39.912
We're gonna go have breakfast right now.

00:00:39.912 --> 00:00:40.858
Oh, that's the other thing.

00:00:40.858 --> 00:00:42.469
We woke up hungry too,

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:44.038
so we've been waiting for breakfast.

00:00:44.038 --> 00:00:45.277
And right now, it's 6 am.

00:00:45.277 --> 00:00:48.621
(coffee machine whirring)

00:00:48.621 --> 00:00:50.272
They have a real mix of food,

00:00:50.272 --> 00:00:53.337
from all the different
cured meats and salmons

00:00:53.337 --> 00:00:56.317
to jamon, (snickers) more ham,

00:00:56.317 --> 00:00:58.467
and then also some Chinese things as well.

00:00:58.467 --> 00:01:00.987
This is ham like being back in Spain.

00:01:00.987 --> 00:01:02.475
And then we got ham, some salmon.

00:01:02.475 --> 00:01:05.247
I got some nuts, some Chinese food,

00:01:05.247 --> 00:01:07.811
and this is what I need to try first,

00:01:07.811 --> 00:01:09.061
is the shumai.

00:01:14.555 --> 00:01:15.388
Mmm.

00:01:17.451 --> 00:01:19.559
Oh, huge pieces of shrimp in there.

00:01:19.559 --> 00:01:23.059
Then also some braised eggplant, I think.

00:01:25.723 --> 00:01:26.556
Mmm.

00:01:28.868 --> 00:01:30.785
That is really creamy.

00:01:31.685 --> 00:01:34.924
This is Europe and
China on a single plate.

00:01:34.924 --> 00:01:37.757
And then we got some dill salmon.

00:01:42.888 --> 00:01:44.935
I think I've had my share of
salmon on this trip so far,

00:01:44.935 --> 00:01:47.225
and I don't regret any bite of it.

00:01:47.225 --> 00:01:50.642
This is a different type of salmon here.

00:01:55.316 --> 00:01:56.149
This is so good though

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.816
I'm gonna have to go
back for more of these.

00:02:00.938 --> 00:02:01.771
Mmm.

00:02:04.244 --> 00:02:05.934
It's packed with shrimp.

00:02:05.934 --> 00:02:08.704
Breakfast was a wonderful success.

00:02:08.704 --> 00:02:12.551
And I like how they also have
coffee you can take to go,

00:02:12.551 --> 00:02:14.906
so I wasn't gonna miss the opportunity.

00:02:14.906 --> 00:02:16.806
Right after breakfast, I
was thinking of going up

00:02:16.806 --> 00:02:18.788
to Victoria Peak, at
least that's what I was

00:02:18.788 --> 00:02:20.317
thinking about doing this morning,

00:02:20.317 --> 00:02:22.626
but it is rainy, it's cloudy.

00:02:22.626 --> 00:02:25.344
There's zero visibility, so I guess

00:02:25.344 --> 00:02:28.511
that's not gonna happen this morning.

00:02:30.543 --> 00:02:31.444
(ticket machine beeps)

00:02:31.444 --> 00:02:32.361
Sheung Wan.

00:02:33.482 --> 00:02:34.315
(ticket machine beeps)

00:02:34.315 --> 00:02:37.398
(fare machine beeps)

00:02:38.771 --> 00:02:40.219
The weather has not let up.

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:43.401
It is still raining, so we
are jumping on the subway.

00:02:43.401 --> 00:02:45.383
We're heading up a couple stations

00:02:45.383 --> 00:02:47.704
and on our way to go eat.

00:02:47.704 --> 00:02:50.204
(light music)

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.631
It looks like it's just
gonna drizzle all day long.

00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:04.131
(light music)

00:03:18.781 --> 00:03:21.531
(diners buzzing)

00:03:25.377 --> 00:03:27.887
We made it to Lin Heung Tea House.

00:03:27.887 --> 00:03:32.025
This is one of the classic dim
sum restaurants in Hong Kong.

00:03:32.025 --> 00:03:34.426
And what I love so much about this place

00:03:34.426 --> 00:03:36.904
is you're just walking along
the street in Hong Kong

00:03:36.904 --> 00:03:39.221
and then you come up the flight of stairs.

00:03:39.221 --> 00:03:41.535
No matter what time of day you come here

00:03:41.535 --> 00:03:44.132
or no matter if it's raining or shining,

00:03:44.132 --> 00:03:46.616
there could be, like,
horrible weather outside,

00:03:46.616 --> 00:03:49.057
and this place will still be packed.

00:03:49.057 --> 00:03:51.167
So you just walk in here,
you find empty tables,

00:03:51.167 --> 00:03:55.334
you share tables with wherever
you can find empty seats.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.028
(exhales)

00:03:58.028 --> 00:04:01.255
And for ordering here, they
push the dim sum around on carts

00:04:01.255 --> 00:04:04.519
and every now and then, they
will bring out a fresh cart

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.628
full of steamed dim sum.

00:04:06.628 --> 00:04:08.695
And you do have to kind of be aggressive.

00:04:08.695 --> 00:04:10.513
So right now, I'm waiting for a fresh cart

00:04:10.513 --> 00:04:14.359
of dim sum to arrive, and
I'm gonna pounce upon it.

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:16.014
And then they mark down all that you order

00:04:16.014 --> 00:04:18.181
on this check sheet here.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.170
(diners buzzing)

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.922
(man speaking in foreign language)

00:04:28.922 --> 00:04:31.672
(diners buzzing)

00:04:39.385 --> 00:04:40.933
It's just an awesome environment in here,

00:04:40.933 --> 00:04:43.663
but it is kind of challenging
because right now,

00:04:43.663 --> 00:04:46.105
it seems like they're not
bringing that many dishes out.

00:04:46.105 --> 00:04:48.050
So as soon as they bring
out a cart full of food,

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.411
you have to run up,

00:04:49.411 --> 00:04:51.275
and you're not sure
exactly what they'll have.

00:04:51.275 --> 00:04:54.163
I managed to get rice, and
this is in a lotus leaf.

00:04:54.163 --> 00:04:56.273
And I don't think it's the
sticky rice that I normally,

00:04:56.273 --> 00:04:59.010
like glutinous rice that I
normally really like for dim sum,

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.763
but this is maybe a different version.

00:05:01.763 --> 00:05:03.850
Rice, looks like there's some ham in here

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.933
and some shrimp and egg.

00:05:09.222 --> 00:05:10.416
Mmm.

00:05:10.416 --> 00:05:12.144
That's just like fried rice

00:05:12.144 --> 00:05:16.239
and then maybe re-steamed
in the lotus leaf.

00:05:16.239 --> 00:05:18.989
(diners buzzing)

00:05:26.918 --> 00:05:27.751
- You want?

00:05:27.751 --> 00:05:28.710
- [Mark] What?

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:29.578
- You want?

00:05:29.578 --> 00:05:31.745
- [Ying] Get one, get one.

00:05:35.762 --> 00:05:39.403
- I managed to get one of my lo mai gai.

00:05:39.403 --> 00:05:42.165
These are not exactly
the ones I really wanted,

00:05:42.165 --> 00:05:44.228
but the demand is so high right now

00:05:44.228 --> 00:05:45.755
that you cannot be too choosy.

00:05:45.755 --> 00:05:48.422
You gotta just take what comes.

00:05:49.304 --> 00:05:53.466
But luckily, ah, this is what
I wanted in the first place.

00:05:53.466 --> 00:05:55.885
I didn't really want that
fried rice in the lotus leaf.

00:05:55.885 --> 00:05:58.874
What I want is lo mai gai,
which is glutinous rice

00:05:58.874 --> 00:06:00.092
steamed in a lotus leaf,

00:06:00.092 --> 00:06:03.907
and it's one of my absolute favorites.

00:06:03.907 --> 00:06:05.931
(snickers) That glutinous rice.

00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:08.165
The lotus leaf is so fragrant.

00:06:08.165 --> 00:06:09.776
And in here should be maybe a mixture

00:06:09.776 --> 00:06:13.365
of meat and also maybe
some Chinese sausage.

00:06:13.365 --> 00:06:14.816
Oh, that gooeyness.

00:06:14.816 --> 00:06:16.306
Since I've been a kid,

00:06:16.306 --> 00:06:18.170
I have always loved to eat dim sum,

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:19.947
and I always used to go to eat dim sum

00:06:19.947 --> 00:06:22.220
with my parents and my relatives,

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.544
and this has always been

00:06:23.544 --> 00:06:25.986
one of my absolute favorite things

00:06:25.986 --> 00:06:27.644
maybe in the entire world.

00:06:27.644 --> 00:06:29.089
And I'd really like some chili sauce,

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:32.438
but it is very challenging
to get a hold of anyone

00:06:32.438 --> 00:06:33.926
to try to get some chili sauce,

00:06:33.926 --> 00:06:35.247
so I'm gonna take my first bite

00:06:35.247 --> 00:06:39.330
and then I'll see if I
can get some chili sauce.

00:06:42.928 --> 00:06:43.761
Oh.

00:06:45.068 --> 00:06:46.151
That sums up

00:06:47.297 --> 00:06:50.064
comfort food to me completely.

00:06:50.064 --> 00:06:51.886
The rice is so gooey,

00:06:51.886 --> 00:06:53.998
and it's almost like saucy.

00:06:53.998 --> 00:06:55.816
But what I love so much about it

00:06:55.816 --> 00:06:58.508
is how that lotus leaf is like...

00:06:58.508 --> 00:06:59.622
The flavor of that lotus leaf

00:06:59.622 --> 00:07:01.644
is embedded into that rice,

00:07:01.644 --> 00:07:04.658
giving it like a little bit
of an earthy green taste.

00:07:04.658 --> 00:07:06.472
This is some kind of feet.

00:07:06.472 --> 00:07:08.498
And I'm pretty sure it's not chicken feet.

00:07:08.498 --> 00:07:10.440
It's either like duck feet or goose feet

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.160
because you can see that entire web.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.351
And these look like they
are very soft and tender

00:07:16.351 --> 00:07:18.768
and braised for a long time.

00:07:28.545 --> 00:07:31.442
That's definitely a web.

00:07:31.442 --> 00:07:32.919
It's very soft.

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:35.313
It almost has like a noodle texture to it

00:07:35.313 --> 00:07:36.601
because it's so soft.

00:07:36.601 --> 00:07:40.768
And then it has that very long
slow braised flavor to it.

00:07:41.975 --> 00:07:42.808
That web.

00:07:47.272 --> 00:07:48.439
Oh, knuckles.

00:07:50.847 --> 00:07:53.828
And then you do have to
remove all those little

00:07:53.828 --> 00:07:54.863
foot bones.

00:07:54.863 --> 00:07:56.507
This is a huge wrap.

00:07:56.507 --> 00:07:58.760
There's, I think, some...

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.541
I think it's a Napa cabbage,

00:08:00.541 --> 00:08:01.700
and then there's some sausage in here.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:05.378
There's a mushroom, there's something.

00:08:05.378 --> 00:08:07.113
I'm not totally sure what's all in here,

00:08:07.113 --> 00:08:09.863
but that is a huge cabbage wrap.

00:08:11.496 --> 00:08:13.913
This is gonna be really hot.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.620
And it's kinda falling apart.

00:08:24.726 --> 00:08:25.559
Mmm.

00:08:27.457 --> 00:08:31.207
It has a little bit of
a ginger taste to it.

00:08:34.691 --> 00:08:36.675
I think this piece is fish cake.

00:08:36.675 --> 00:08:39.070
I managed to get some shrimp dumplings.

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:43.511
I think these are har gow
fresh out of a steamer.

00:08:43.511 --> 00:08:46.655
I need to go look for
some chili sauce though.

00:08:46.655 --> 00:08:48.518
Okay, that was only partially successful.

00:08:48.518 --> 00:08:50.959
I kinda ran around the restaurant
for the last 10 minutes

00:08:50.959 --> 00:08:52.900
trying to find chili sauce,

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.470
and I got some kind of red sauce,

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:57.196
and then I also came
away with some mustard.

00:08:57.196 --> 00:08:59.301
Mustard I do love.

00:08:59.301 --> 00:09:02.551
I'll go for one of the shrimp har gow.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.560
And I'm gonna dip into the mustard.

00:09:08.359 --> 00:09:09.192
Mm.

00:09:10.438 --> 00:09:11.271
Mmmm.

00:09:12.313 --> 00:09:14.404
Just filled with shrimp

00:09:14.404 --> 00:09:17.509
and then just with a glutinous wrapper.

00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:20.592
Now I'll try some of the chili sauce,

00:09:22.923 --> 00:09:25.590
put some of this onto the rice.

00:09:34.292 --> 00:09:35.125
Mmm, mmm.

00:09:37.098 --> 00:09:39.409
Oh, that is a little bit spicy and sour.

00:09:39.409 --> 00:09:42.492
Okay, I've got one final foot to go.

00:09:55.918 --> 00:09:57.140
I think I like it better than chicken feet

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.290
because there is more skin

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:02.305
to this web than a chicken foot.

00:10:02.305 --> 00:10:06.401
I would call that
semi-successful with the dim sum.

00:10:06.401 --> 00:10:07.765
And then once you're done,

00:10:07.765 --> 00:10:09.338
you take your check card,

00:10:09.338 --> 00:10:11.239
and these are all of the
dishes that I ordered

00:10:11.239 --> 00:10:12.479
that she marked down.

00:10:12.479 --> 00:10:14.380
And then you go up to the front and pay.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:17.520
This place just has so much character.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.351
The thing is it can be
a little bit challenging

00:10:19.351 --> 00:10:22.578
to eat here because you have to really be

00:10:22.578 --> 00:10:23.861
both patient and aggressive,

00:10:23.861 --> 00:10:25.719
and sometimes you don't get to eat

00:10:25.719 --> 00:10:27.949
the different dim sums that
you were really hoping to eat

00:10:27.949 --> 00:10:30.636
because, number one,
they just don't come out

00:10:30.636 --> 00:10:32.094
and you might have to
sit there for a long time

00:10:32.094 --> 00:10:33.387
and wait for it, or, number two,

00:10:33.387 --> 00:10:35.569
you get to the cart and
they're already gone.

00:10:35.569 --> 00:10:37.466
They've just been pounced on.

00:10:37.466 --> 00:10:40.564
But anyway, how can you not appreciate

00:10:40.564 --> 00:10:43.501
that exciting atmosphere in there?

00:10:43.501 --> 00:10:46.971
Today was one of those days
that I didn't exactly get to eat

00:10:46.971 --> 00:10:50.478
all of the dim sum that I
wanted to eat, but that's okay.

00:10:50.478 --> 00:10:54.324
You just cannot beat
that classic atmosphere.

00:10:54.324 --> 00:10:56.680
From here, I was thinking
it would be a great idea

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.579
to go have some brisket noodles next.

00:10:59.579 --> 00:11:02.079
(light music)

00:11:07.391 --> 00:11:08.923
And they are very, very well known

00:11:08.923 --> 00:11:11.567
for brisket noodles and brisket curry.

00:11:11.567 --> 00:11:13.302
And they open at 12:30.

00:11:13.302 --> 00:11:15.453
It's about 12:15 right now,

00:11:15.453 --> 00:11:18.555
and there is a line of about

00:11:18.555 --> 00:11:20.461
maybe like 100 people.

00:11:20.461 --> 00:11:22.116
(snickers) I'm now trying
to decide right now

00:11:22.116 --> 00:11:24.186
if I should wait in line.

00:11:24.186 --> 00:11:26.212
I guess we don't really
have anything else to do.

00:11:26.212 --> 00:11:29.129
(machine whirring)

00:11:30.318 --> 00:11:33.068
(diners buzzing)

00:11:36.827 --> 00:11:39.307
We made it inside and we came upstairs.

00:11:39.307 --> 00:11:41.832
The wait to get in here
did not take too long,

00:11:41.832 --> 00:11:44.193
but luckily, they have a bottom
floor and then a top floor,

00:11:44.193 --> 00:11:48.163
and then they really pack
you in here on round tables

00:11:48.163 --> 00:11:50.073
and just sharing tables.

00:11:50.073 --> 00:11:54.043
And then I just ordered
one of the brisket noodles,

00:11:54.043 --> 00:11:57.600
and then also, I got a tendon
with curry and noodles.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.350
(diners buzzing)

00:12:01.734 --> 00:12:04.378
It is extremely tight quarters in here,

00:12:04.378 --> 00:12:06.363
and we are all eating family style,

00:12:06.363 --> 00:12:09.591
but I will do my best
to vlog all about it.

00:12:09.591 --> 00:12:11.491
We got two different dishes
to share, Ying and I.

00:12:11.491 --> 00:12:13.890
One of them is the brisket noodles,

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:15.834
which is one of their classic dishes,

00:12:15.834 --> 00:12:17.542
and that's what they
are very well known for.

00:12:17.542 --> 00:12:20.317
But then I also got a curry with tendon,

00:12:20.317 --> 00:12:23.622
and I think it came with
some shredded brisket as well

00:12:23.622 --> 00:12:27.720
and yeah, I'm about to
dig in to both of them.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.362
I'm gonna begin with the
tendon and the curry,

00:12:30.362 --> 00:12:32.844
and then there are rice
noodles on the bottom here,

00:12:32.844 --> 00:12:36.766
and also there's pieces of, I
think this is brisket as well.

00:12:36.766 --> 00:12:38.871
Oh, that looks fantastic.

00:12:38.871 --> 00:12:43.418
Okay, I'll get a little bit
of everything in this bite.

00:12:43.418 --> 00:12:45.872
Mmm, yeah, you can smell a
little bit of the curry powder

00:12:45.872 --> 00:12:50.039
and like a little bit of a
maybe cinnamon aroma to it.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.113
Mmmm.

00:12:59.717 --> 00:13:02.134
Okay, that is awesome, yeah.

00:13:04.879 --> 00:13:06.546
Wow, that's good.

00:13:06.546 --> 00:13:08.366
Okay, so it's just a little bit spicy.

00:13:08.366 --> 00:13:11.759
You can taste that curry powder.

00:13:11.759 --> 00:13:15.522
Maybe there is like a star
anise in there as well.

00:13:15.522 --> 00:13:19.737
There's also some kind of
an herb taste to it as well.

00:13:19.737 --> 00:13:21.434
Yeah, that is ridiculously good though.

00:13:21.434 --> 00:13:23.211
That is awesome.

00:13:23.211 --> 00:13:26.711
Let me try one of those pieces of tendon.

00:13:27.883 --> 00:13:31.800
That is a pretty significant
nugget of tendon.

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.165
Yeah, that is good tendon, and it has a,

00:13:41.165 --> 00:13:43.602
a gelatinous texture of course,

00:13:43.602 --> 00:13:47.769
but it's like it soaked up
all of that curry flavor.

00:13:50.046 --> 00:13:50.879
- [Ying] Oh my God.

00:13:50.879 --> 00:13:51.802
- [Mark] Let me try to dig down now

00:13:51.802 --> 00:13:54.469
into those noodles below there.

00:14:00.279 --> 00:14:01.112
Mmm.

00:14:03.341 --> 00:14:05.199
That has a really nice, like,

00:14:05.199 --> 00:14:07.271
herb curry flavor to it as well.

00:14:07.271 --> 00:14:09.457
The classic brisket noodles now.

00:14:09.457 --> 00:14:13.457
I just gotta have a piece
of that brisket first.

00:14:17.318 --> 00:14:18.765
Oh wow.

00:14:18.765 --> 00:14:19.925
That brisket is amazing.

00:14:19.925 --> 00:14:22.114
It's tender, but it has like a little bit

00:14:22.114 --> 00:14:24.447
of a stringy texture to it.

00:14:25.342 --> 00:14:27.247
You can taste the beef in it,

00:14:27.247 --> 00:14:28.776
and then it just tastes like here,

00:14:28.776 --> 00:14:31.586
with the green onions and then...

00:14:31.586 --> 00:14:33.987
And I think that broth
is just a very kind of

00:14:33.987 --> 00:14:38.154
plain soothing broth, but
it's all about that brisket.

00:14:41.063 --> 00:14:43.146
(slurps)

00:14:44.159 --> 00:14:45.360
Let me grab that spoon

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.943
and I'll just taste that soup.

00:14:52.386 --> 00:14:53.959
Mmm.

00:14:53.959 --> 00:14:56.809
Okay, actually tasting
the soup on its own,

00:14:56.809 --> 00:15:00.059
it has a very, very rich flavor to it.

00:15:01.395 --> 00:15:03.175
I think it's beef-based.

00:15:03.175 --> 00:15:04.293
I'm not really sure, but it does have

00:15:04.293 --> 00:15:06.775
like an umami component to it.

00:15:06.775 --> 00:15:07.809
It's salty.

00:15:07.809 --> 00:15:09.422
It's a little bit sweet.

00:15:09.422 --> 00:15:11.449
And yeah, you can taste that meatiness.

00:15:11.449 --> 00:15:14.782
I'm gonna try some of this chili sauce.

00:15:24.391 --> 00:15:25.224
Mmm.

00:15:26.378 --> 00:15:27.533
Oh, that chili sauce is good.

00:15:27.533 --> 00:15:29.595
It's salty and a little bit spicy.

00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:32.095
It goes great with that beef.

00:15:39.557 --> 00:15:40.390
- [Woman] Okay?

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:41.223
- [Ying] Yeah.

00:15:41.223 --> 00:15:42.056
- [Mark] Okay, thank you.

00:15:42.056 --> 00:15:42.889
- [Woman] Buh-bye,

00:15:42.889 --> 00:15:46.219
buh-bye, buh-bye.
- Thank you.

00:15:46.219 --> 00:15:48.723
- Exit is on the right side.

00:15:48.723 --> 00:15:49.763
I'm glad we waited in line.

00:15:49.763 --> 00:15:50.960
And the line didn't take too long.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.434
So even if you see a
line when you come here,

00:15:53.434 --> 00:15:54.505
don't be intimidated.

00:15:54.505 --> 00:15:56.242
It goes pretty fast because

00:15:56.242 --> 00:15:59.224
they just cram people into the restaurant.

00:15:59.224 --> 00:16:02.162
I think we were sitting at
just a little round table.

00:16:02.162 --> 00:16:05.928
It couldn't have been more
round than my arm span.

00:16:05.928 --> 00:16:08.327
And they put six of us on that table,

00:16:08.327 --> 00:16:11.107
and then the entire place was just packed.

00:16:11.107 --> 00:16:12.509
And then people mostly just go in there

00:16:12.509 --> 00:16:14.744
to slurp down their bowl
of noodles and then leave,

00:16:14.744 --> 00:16:16.146
so the line goes fast.

00:16:16.146 --> 00:16:17.884
I think I would go for the...

00:16:17.884 --> 00:16:19.081
Actually, I liked both of them,

00:16:19.081 --> 00:16:20.156
how they were so different,

00:16:20.156 --> 00:16:23.048
but the curry noodles with that tendon,

00:16:23.048 --> 00:16:24.533
that was the winner for me.

00:16:24.533 --> 00:16:27.033
(light music)

00:16:29.699 --> 00:16:30.896
Since we are in this area,

00:16:30.896 --> 00:16:32.959
I thought we would stop by a temple next,

00:16:32.959 --> 00:16:34.489
which is just down the road.

00:16:34.489 --> 00:16:36.989
(light music)

00:16:41.886 --> 00:16:43.496
This is the Man Mo Temple,

00:16:43.496 --> 00:16:47.365
and it was built between
the years of 1847 and 1862.

00:16:47.365 --> 00:16:50.383
It is a Taoist temple,
and it's just surrounded

00:16:50.383 --> 00:16:53.864
by sky-rise buildings
rising through the sky.

00:16:53.864 --> 00:16:57.781
And I'm gonna go take a
look inside real fast.

00:17:01.308 --> 00:17:03.498
It's very peaceful and quiet in here.

00:17:03.498 --> 00:17:05.024
And on the top ceiling there,

00:17:05.024 --> 00:17:07.086
there are just coils of incense

00:17:07.086 --> 00:17:09.365
that just continuously burn.

00:17:09.365 --> 00:17:11.865
(light music)

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.423
It's not a huge temple,

00:17:17.423 --> 00:17:19.284
but on that plaque board behind me,

00:17:19.284 --> 00:17:22.350
it says that it's a monument
because it demonstrates

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:25.243
traditional Chinese
vernacular architecture,

00:17:25.243 --> 00:17:27.858
and especially the ceramics and the murals

00:17:27.858 --> 00:17:29.967
and the architecture of the temple.

00:17:29.967 --> 00:17:31.418
Form here, Ying and I have decided

00:17:31.418 --> 00:17:32.655
to go back to the metro,

00:17:32.655 --> 00:17:35.548
and we're gonna head back to
the hotel for a little while

00:17:35.548 --> 00:17:38.117
and try to maybe rest.

00:17:38.117 --> 00:17:39.113
We're starting to get sleepy.

00:17:39.113 --> 00:17:41.755
Maybe it's that food or
maybe it's the jet lag.

00:17:41.755 --> 00:17:44.564
But we're going back to the
hotel for a little while

00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:47.375
and then going out again
for dinner tonight.

00:17:47.375 --> 00:17:49.875
(light music)

00:17:57.547 --> 00:18:00.630
(fare machine beeps)

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:04.541
We made it back to Admiralty,

00:18:04.541 --> 00:18:08.590
and all at once, I am
feeling extremely groggy.

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:11.090
(light music)

00:18:19.256 --> 00:18:21.155
I slept for two hours.

00:18:21.155 --> 00:18:22.762
It was so hard to wake up.

00:18:22.762 --> 00:18:25.234
But when I got up, the sun is shining.

00:18:25.234 --> 00:18:26.519
It's pretty clear.

00:18:26.519 --> 00:18:28.963
So Ying is back at the
hotel, still resting,

00:18:28.963 --> 00:18:30.580
but I'm gonna use this opportunity

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:32.271
to go to the top of Victoria Peak

00:18:32.271 --> 00:18:33.883
for the view of Hong Kong.

00:18:33.883 --> 00:18:36.383
(light music)

00:18:39.338 --> 00:18:43.270
My happiness to go to the
top was a little short-lived.

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:45.171
I have been met by a line

00:18:45.171 --> 00:18:48.604
that literally stretches down the highway.

00:18:48.604 --> 00:18:51.089
There must be thousands
of people before me.

00:18:51.089 --> 00:18:54.339
I'm not sure how long it's gonna take.

00:18:55.263 --> 00:18:57.480
I would just walk to the top of the hill

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.006
because I like to hike,

00:18:59.006 --> 00:19:01.652
but I wanna take the
funicular, the Peak Tram

00:19:01.652 --> 00:19:03.179
for the experience to ride up

00:19:03.179 --> 00:19:05.665
because it's a real classic funicular.

00:19:05.665 --> 00:19:06.822
So I'm gonna stand in line,

00:19:06.822 --> 00:19:09.382
see how fast the line goes.

00:19:09.382 --> 00:19:10.995
I guess I am not the only one

00:19:10.995 --> 00:19:13.271
who waited out the rain this morning

00:19:13.271 --> 00:19:15.507
and waited for sunshine this afternoon.

00:19:15.507 --> 00:19:17.734
I have decided to ditch the tram.

00:19:17.734 --> 00:19:19.518
That's gonna take hours to wait in line,

00:19:19.518 --> 00:19:21.922
and I think I can make it up by walking

00:19:21.922 --> 00:19:23.612
maybe in less than an hour,

00:19:23.612 --> 00:19:25.799
so I'm on my way hiking.

00:19:25.799 --> 00:19:27.526
Plus, I could use the exercise.

00:19:27.526 --> 00:19:28.359
Hello.

00:19:28.359 --> 00:19:29.192
- Hi.

00:19:29.192 --> 00:19:31.692
(light music)

00:19:37.661 --> 00:19:40.277
- It is incredibly humid in Hong Kong.

00:19:40.277 --> 00:19:42.468
I'm starting to drip with sweat.

00:19:42.468 --> 00:19:45.612
But I am very glad I made
the decision to walk.

00:19:45.612 --> 00:19:48.878
I'd much rather be hiking
and getting a workout

00:19:48.878 --> 00:19:51.030
than standing in line
waiting for the tram.

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:53.530
(light music)

00:19:55.664 --> 00:19:59.179
The sign back there said I have
a 30-minute walk to the peak

00:19:59.179 --> 00:20:03.061
but I'm not so sure I took
the most direct route.

00:20:03.061 --> 00:20:07.234
I was trying to follow
the funicular at first,

00:20:07.234 --> 00:20:08.927
but then it got all
confusing in the lanes.

00:20:08.927 --> 00:20:11.736
But anyway, I am on the right course now.

00:20:11.736 --> 00:20:14.236
(light music)

00:20:16.986 --> 00:20:19.385
I made it to the top of the peak.

00:20:19.385 --> 00:20:22.610
I am just dripping,
covered in sweat right now.

00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:24.343
But I am very glad that I did not wait

00:20:24.343 --> 00:20:26.368
for the tram, the funicular.

00:20:26.368 --> 00:20:28.931
That took me exactly 35,

00:20:28.931 --> 00:20:31.584
in between 35 and 40
minutes to get to the top.

00:20:31.584 --> 00:20:33.444
I did make a wrong turn,

00:20:33.444 --> 00:20:35.139
but then I really did
kinda huffed and puffed it

00:20:35.139 --> 00:20:36.549
all the way to the top

00:20:36.549 --> 00:20:38.239
because I wanted to beat the light,

00:20:38.239 --> 00:20:40.052
and there is still a little bit of light.

00:20:40.052 --> 00:20:42.411
It's not quite as clear
as it was when I started,

00:20:42.411 --> 00:20:45.509
but the view is still pretty spectacular.

00:20:45.509 --> 00:20:48.322
This is one of the most
iconic views of Hong Kong

00:20:48.322 --> 00:20:50.676
from Hong Kong Island on Victoria Peak,

00:20:50.676 --> 00:20:53.400
and you can see all of
downtown Hong Kong Island

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.836
as well as the other
side, which is Kowloon.

00:20:55.836 --> 00:20:58.336
(light music)

00:21:05.627 --> 00:21:06.460
- Okay.

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:07.293
- Nice to meet you, Jeffrey.

00:21:07.293 --> 00:21:08.126
- Yeah, nice.

00:21:08.126 --> 00:21:09.525
- [Mark] And once you're
up here at the peak,

00:21:09.525 --> 00:21:11.341
you can walk around on the edge

00:21:11.341 --> 00:21:14.855
and just enjoy the amazing
astounding views of Hong Kong.

00:21:14.855 --> 00:21:17.332
Hong Kong really has one
of the greatest skylines

00:21:17.332 --> 00:21:18.774
in the entire world.

00:21:18.774 --> 00:21:21.274
(light music)

00:21:23.528 --> 00:21:24.477
That was excellent.

00:21:24.477 --> 00:21:26.091
It felt great to get some exercise

00:21:26.091 --> 00:21:28.159
and fantastic views of Hong Kong.

00:21:28.159 --> 00:21:30.393
And now time to head
down before it gets dark.

00:21:30.393 --> 00:21:32.893
(light music)

00:21:38.877 --> 00:21:40.443
What's so amazing about Hong Kong

00:21:40.443 --> 00:21:44.165
is that you can actually
hike yourself out of a city.

00:21:44.165 --> 00:21:46.665
(light music)

00:21:57.144 --> 00:22:00.496
After the hike, I went back
to the hotel, had a shower,

00:22:00.496 --> 00:22:03.907
and now we are walking on
our way to have dinner.

00:22:03.907 --> 00:22:06.657
(diners buzzing)

00:22:09.553 --> 00:22:10.902
Came to this restaurant, yeah,

00:22:10.902 --> 00:22:12.634
and I wanna say thank you to Tim

00:22:12.634 --> 00:22:14.574
for this restaurant recommendation.

00:22:14.574 --> 00:22:15.940
This is a restaurant that serves

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.523
all sorts of different dishes.

00:22:20.782 --> 00:22:22.602
I ordered three different dishes.

00:22:22.602 --> 00:22:25.049
I went up front there and saw a fish.

00:22:25.049 --> 00:22:28.605
I think it's a little
red snapper possibly,

00:22:28.605 --> 00:22:30.588
and it looks maybe steamed,

00:22:30.588 --> 00:22:31.662
so I got one of those,

00:22:31.662 --> 00:22:33.523
and then I also ordered a vegetable dish

00:22:33.523 --> 00:22:36.332
as well as Hong Kong-style eggplant.

00:22:36.332 --> 00:22:38.415
I'll begin with the fish,

00:22:39.633 --> 00:22:41.410
maybe dip that into the sauce.

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:45.082
This looks like a fermented bean sauce.

00:22:45.082 --> 00:22:46.239
Put that onto my rice,

00:22:46.239 --> 00:22:49.739
or maybe I'll just take a bite out of it.

00:22:50.743 --> 00:22:52.108
Mmm.

00:22:52.108 --> 00:22:54.879
That sauce is very salty.

00:22:54.879 --> 00:22:57.998
That needs to be eaten with rice.

00:22:57.998 --> 00:22:59.633
(man speaking in foreign language)

00:22:59.633 --> 00:23:02.484
(food steaming)

00:23:02.484 --> 00:23:03.771
This is the next dish that I ordered.

00:23:03.771 --> 00:23:06.004
It came in a flaming hot skillet.

00:23:06.004 --> 00:23:08.992
And what type of vegetable
is this, Ying, you know?

00:23:08.992 --> 00:23:10.030
(speaking in foreign language)

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:11.233
- [Ying] Yeah.

00:23:11.233 --> 00:23:12.391
- [Mark] It's either the vegetable,

00:23:12.391 --> 00:23:16.028
I think it's the outer leaves of cabbage.

00:23:16.028 --> 00:23:18.011
Yeah, I think that's what it is.

00:23:18.011 --> 00:23:19.086
I'm not totally sure.

00:23:19.086 --> 00:23:21.066
And then oh, you can really smell

00:23:21.066 --> 00:23:23.046
like a fishy kind of aroma to it.

00:23:23.046 --> 00:23:25.274
I think these are dry shrimp,

00:23:25.274 --> 00:23:27.172
and there might be some
salted fish in here too

00:23:27.172 --> 00:23:28.823
and then minced pork.

00:23:28.823 --> 00:23:31.573
Let me just taste a bit of this.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.196
Mmm.

00:23:36.196 --> 00:23:38.181
The vegetable is still crisp,

00:23:38.181 --> 00:23:40.536
but you can taste that
seared flavor to it.

00:23:40.536 --> 00:23:43.036
And I think that is like dry,

00:23:44.868 --> 00:23:46.520
dry fish or just dry shrimp,

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:49.127
but it definitely has a little
bit of a fishy taste to it,

00:23:49.127 --> 00:23:50.164
but that complements it.

00:23:50.164 --> 00:23:54.331
It makes it salty, and that
provides all the flavor.

00:24:00.209 --> 00:24:01.042
Mmm.

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:07.119
(Ying snickers)

00:24:07.119 --> 00:24:08.569
Whoa.

00:24:08.569 --> 00:24:10.012
I didn't know I ordered that.

00:24:10.012 --> 00:24:10.845
(Ying snickers)

00:24:10.845 --> 00:24:11.830
I have to say in all honesty

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:13.155
that I thought this eggplant dish

00:24:13.155 --> 00:24:14.807
was gonna be like a braised eggplant dish

00:24:14.807 --> 00:24:18.031
in a pot as well, but it's
actually slices of eggplant

00:24:18.031 --> 00:24:21.748
which are then coated and
battered and deep fried.

00:24:21.748 --> 00:24:23.983
(snickers) And this is
quite a beautiful plate,

00:24:23.983 --> 00:24:26.415
and then all sorts of crispies on top.

00:24:26.415 --> 00:24:28.475
There are, it looks like dried chilis

00:24:28.475 --> 00:24:30.622
all mixed in and green onions.

00:24:30.622 --> 00:24:33.518
I'll go for this guy
and maybe black beans.

00:24:33.518 --> 00:24:36.119
Oh wow, these are like eggplant...

00:24:36.119 --> 00:24:37.438
Oh, it's very light.

00:24:37.438 --> 00:24:39.837
I will dip into, I think
this is just soy sauce maybe,

00:24:39.837 --> 00:24:41.004
I'm not sure.

00:24:42.072 --> 00:24:44.822
(food crunching)

00:24:46.031 --> 00:24:48.594
It's really, really crispy on the outside

00:24:48.594 --> 00:24:50.415
and then really creamy

00:24:50.415 --> 00:24:52.361
and just fall apart tender on the inside.

00:24:52.361 --> 00:24:54.591
And as I, like, sucked in,

00:24:54.591 --> 00:24:57.730
I could taste those chili seeds.

00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:00.738
They have like fumes, chili
fumes coming off of them.

00:25:00.738 --> 00:25:02.230
Mmm, it is a little bit spicy.

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:05.647
Those are deep friend eggplant fritters.

00:25:11.904 --> 00:25:13.308
Mmm.

00:25:13.308 --> 00:25:16.456
All of those green onions and those chilis

00:25:16.456 --> 00:25:18.152
and maybe that's garlic on there too.

00:25:18.152 --> 00:25:20.753
Definitely the winner of the
meal is that vegetable dish.

00:25:20.753 --> 00:25:22.988
It's flavored so nicely
with those dried shrimp.

00:25:22.988 --> 00:25:24.312
And on the bottom,

00:25:24.312 --> 00:25:27.289
there are just big huge cloves of garlic

00:25:27.289 --> 00:25:30.017
which have just been fried
in the oil below there,

00:25:30.017 --> 00:25:32.043
and they are barely identifiable as garlic

00:25:32.043 --> 00:25:34.618
because they're so soft.

00:25:34.618 --> 00:25:36.954
Oh yeah, it just melts in your mouth.

00:25:36.954 --> 00:25:38.193
That was a great dinner

00:25:38.193 --> 00:25:41.132
friendly staff and great ambiance.

00:25:41.132 --> 00:25:44.127
It's a Hong Kong busy environment,

00:25:44.127 --> 00:25:46.319
but it was kind of spacious for Hong Kong

00:25:46.319 --> 00:25:48.591
at the same time, not too hectic,

00:25:48.591 --> 00:25:51.071
good food, especially that vegetable dish,

00:25:51.071 --> 00:25:53.140
that was the winner of the meal.

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:56.114
(speaking in foreign language)

00:25:56.114 --> 00:25:57.477
Okay, the restaurant is called

00:25:57.477 --> 00:25:58.885
(speaking in foreign language),

00:25:58.885 --> 00:26:00.539
and they just have me their business card.

00:26:00.539 --> 00:26:03.039
(light music)

00:26:09.055 --> 00:26:11.953
We're in a taxi and
heading back to the hotel.

00:26:11.953 --> 00:26:14.309
