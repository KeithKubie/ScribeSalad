00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.970
In the year 1944, computers
weighed as much as 4,500

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.520
kilograms.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:14.530
A modern laptop weighs
around 2.7 kilograms.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.830
What is the ratio of how much
computers weighed in 1944

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.490
to how much a modern
laptop weighs?

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.430
Express your answer as
a ratio of two integers.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:31.330
So the ratio of how much
computers weighed in 1944--

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.010
so we know that's 4,500
kilograms-- we want

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.520
the ratio of that to how
much a modern laptop weighs,

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.550
and that's 2.7 kilograms.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.690
So this right over
here is a ratio.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.620
But we haven't expressed it
as a ratio of two integers.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.790
In particular,
4,500 is an integer.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.710
But 2.7 is not an integer.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.900
So the easy way to
convert 2.7 to an integer

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.950
is to move the decimal
place one to the right.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.099
Or another way of thinking about
it is to multiply it by 10.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:06.160
So we can multiply this by 10.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.820
But if we just multiplied
the denominator by 10,

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.696
that would change the
value of the ratio.

00:01:10.696 --> 00:01:12.070
In order to not
change the value,

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.860
we have to multiply the
numerator and the denominator

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:15.650
by 10.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.970
This is equivalent to just
multiplying this fraction

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.240
by 10/10, which is
the same thing as one.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.850
It does not change the value.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.150
So what do we get?

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.754
Well, in the numerator,
4,500 times 10 is 45,000.

00:01:28.754 --> 00:01:29.670
I'll put a comma here.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.416
It makes it a little
bit easier to read.

00:01:31.416 --> 00:01:32.790
And in the
denominator-- and this

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.800
is the whole point of why
we multiplied by 10-- 2.7

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.470
multiplied by 10 is 27.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.940
So we now have
expressed our answer

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.350
as a ratio of two integers.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.090
So this is completely
legitimate.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.170
But we could also simplify this.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.700
Just looking at this,
it looks like 45,000

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.340
is divisible by 45,
which is divisible by 9.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.057
And 27 is also divisible by 9.

00:02:00.057 --> 00:02:02.390
So why don't we divide the
numerator and the denominator

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.490
both by 9?

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.860
So we're going to divide
by 9 in the numerator,

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.460
and we're going to divide
by 9 in the denominator.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.050
And we are going to get
45 divided by 9 is 5.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.400
So 45,000 divided by 9 is 5,000.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:26.210
So we're going to get 5,000
over-- 27 divided by 9 is 3.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.580
And I think we have now
simplified this about as much

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.510
as we can.
