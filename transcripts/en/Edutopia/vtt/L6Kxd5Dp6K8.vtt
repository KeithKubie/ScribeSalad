00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.730
- Our school has about 800 kids,

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.010
located on the near
north side of Nashville.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.170
Our kids are coming from communities

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.770
that aren't language
rich in a lot of ways.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.630
So our kids come to us
with lots of opportunities

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.740
for growth, especially
when it comes to literacy.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.780
We've worked not only
assemble a team of teachers

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.970
who really understand
teaching and learning,

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.410
but are really able to build
those quality relationships

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.190
and then generate outcomes.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.910
I came five years ago,
and in the five years

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.310
there's been a lot of change.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.285
(birds chirping)

00:00:49.285 --> 00:00:52.452
(students chattering)

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.860
We teach kids behaviors in the same way

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.730
we teach them reading and writing.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.740
- I really want you to
think on who you are,

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.000
what you represent, things
that you're going through,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.780
things that you've accomplished.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:08.813
- We started by saying,

00:01:08.813 --> 00:01:10.690
we're gonna respect every single kid.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.160
So we don't yell at kids.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.470
I will never yell at my staff,
I will not yell at a student,

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.560
and if they are yelling at
us, we're gonna teach them

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.740
that that's not okay.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.570
And so starting to really change the way

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.140
we think about interacting with others.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.540
- They keep reminding us,

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.260
you're greater than what you think.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.470
We keep our heads up.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.120
We come in, do what we have to do

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.390
so we can be that school that
no one thought we could be.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.098
- [Sonia] But then from there you have

00:01:37.098 --> 00:01:38.298
to really build systems.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.140
We have five core values.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.400
They are in every hallway
and in every classroom.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.900
So they see it all the time
and they hear it all the time.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.410
We also have non-negotiables
that are really specific.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.830
- All right, you guys know what's expected

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.250
of you today, correct?

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.670
Kids are not swearing,
they're not on their phones,

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.290
they're respecting the teachers.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.200
There's a common language.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.290
The expectations in my classroom

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.620
look exactly the same way
as in another classroom.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.550
So there's no confusion,
and it creates more time

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.040
for valuable instruction.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.170
- We took a model,
looking at peer feedback,

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.590
and how we could really
support each other.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.610
We all kinda come together.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.580
We're looking at classroom
behavior, classroom culture,

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.240
looking at those core values.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.810
We can kinda check off what's
being adhered to or broken.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.993
- We watched hands go like this.

00:02:37.993 --> 00:02:39.400
- [Marqo] And then we
talk about what we see.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.390
When we look at the core
values, a lot of what we saw

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.590
was evidence of others first.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.630
- People feel safe when
they know what to expect.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.970
And so, when you're
consistent, room to room,

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.160
hallway to hallway, academy to academy,

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.340
kids feel safe within that structure

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.410
and are quicker to learn.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.280
There's a lot of other things that we do

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.990
to create spaces that are conducive

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.480
for social emotional learning.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.616
- [Teacher] Well, good morning, everybody.

00:03:07.616 --> 00:03:08.449
- [Class] Good morning.

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:10.650
- Welcome to the Zone.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.160
- [Sonia] We have a place
called the Zone which we use

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.550
in lieu of suspension.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.830
- This space is created
to have a conversation

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.860
about navigating those issues.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.110
- [Sonia] Kids get into
a circle and they discuss

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.610
what their behaviors were,
and ways to correct it.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.340
We have another space where
our counselor is located.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.128
- All right, so you're
gonna talk to first.

00:03:30.128 --> 00:03:31.910
And when he get done,
you're gonna talk, okay?

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.660
- [Sonia] Who does real-time
conflict resolution.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.490
- I didn't wanna tell
you who to hang with.

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.320
- [Sonia] We can't expect
people to just get along.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.490
We have to show them what
getting along looks like.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.480
- You are both strong young men.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.510
- Something is knowing how I
contributed to the conflict,

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.882
right, and how to respond
to you with empathy.

00:03:48.882 --> 00:03:50.680
- I wasn't solving that the right way.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.280
I should've communicated better.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.250
- [Sonia] We have a space
that we call My Space

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.740
that feels a lot like a student union.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.830
We use it both for a reward,
but it's also open at lunch,

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.900
where kids can play and be with kids.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.480
- It's over, I'm winning.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.800
- And so, when you design
spaces for them to interact

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.170
in healthy positive ways, they interact

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.640
in healthy and positive ways.

00:04:16.861 --> 00:04:19.111
(laughing)

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.200
- What we're gonna look at
today is a very quick article

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.880
that really answers the question,

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.300
Why do we encourage ourselves to breathe?

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.490
Why have we concentrated so much on it

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.140
and why it's so hard sometimes.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.980
- Rachael Hunt, one of our
exceptional educators here,

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.130
has worked dominantly
with our kids that have

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.750
some sort of learning
disability related to behavior.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.560
- New research published
in the journal Science

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.870
suggests that you heed the advice.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.650
- All right, so what's
the first thing we do

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.600
when we read that article
and we're annotating?

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.540
We do a literacy standard every day,

00:04:56.038 --> 00:04:58.820
but we teach social emotional learning

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.350
through that literacy.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.740
So, who wants to ready our
first paragraph for us?

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.610
- Regular breathing.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.100
- We are reading a brief article

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.770
on the science behind how
breathing actually impacts

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.190
our bodies and our minds.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.470
They will analyze the
text, so they'll annotate.

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.590
We do a lot of discussion.

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.040
And then we also do an activity
connected to the article.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.970
Who in here was stressed
the last two weeks.

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.330
You can actually communicate to your body,

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.970
I'm all right, man, it's cool,

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.335
by changing the way you breathe.

00:05:28.335 --> 00:05:30.935
So we are going to do some
actual mindful breathing.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.080
We practiced breathing and really thought

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.800
about what the breathing made us feel.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.540
Breathe naturally.

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.700
- I was getting in
trouble, getting suspended.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.420
This semester, I had a big turnaround.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.840
Getting better grades, because meditation,

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.080
it helped me release all
that anger, annihilate it.

00:05:51.774 --> 00:05:55.220
It made me like, change.

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.030
- [Sonia] She has said
these practices are great

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.210
not just for my kids but us as a school.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.186
- We're gonna begin just with
two minutes of mindfulness.

00:06:05.186 --> 00:06:07.769
(bell ringing)

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.900
- [Sonia] The Nest is our daily advisory.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.850
We divided it into two chunks.

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.680
Half of the time is that social
emotional learning piece,

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.110
and then the second part is
spent reading a novel together.

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.000
- We are going to dig back into this book.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.330
We wanna broaden kids'
capacity to enjoy reading

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.960
by having deep conversations
about the subjects and themes

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.530
that kids live out.

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.550
So in the middle of page
100, you've got this cop

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.300
who represents this abusive authority

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.130
and you had a reaction to that.

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:44.730
- People abuse their
authority when they get it.

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:48.350
This boy got beat up by a police officer.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:49.870
When I heard that, it like,

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:53.100
I instantly, it just draw me into it

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.840
because like, I see, I
go through every day.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.452
- [Student] A lot of this
stuff's actually happened.

00:06:59.452 --> 00:07:01.630
- Right, like there's a lot
of police brutality going on.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.730
- The Nest lays the ground
for academic learning.

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:07.100
It holds kids to higher standards
and higher expectations.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.070
It's a time to build community,

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.190
make certain every kid has
at least one individual

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.760
in the building that invests personally

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.300
in his or her best.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:17.790
- Our Nest is a family.

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.460
I feel like I can talk about
anything I need to here.

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.290
- We have huge accomplishments
around outcomes.

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:29.030
Our discipline is going down.

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:30.360
Our learning is going up.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.610
Our kids are coming to school more,

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.140
they feel more connected.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:36.100
All of that is indicative of the things

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.380
that we're successful in.

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:41.170
We get to recognize the
outstanding accomplishments

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:43.380
of 18 of our seniors
who are gonna be signing

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.630
full academic scholarships today.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:48.870
Looking at the data,
they've grown in learning.

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:52.380
But far more than that,
they have become people

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:54.360
who are increasingly more
aware of who they are

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:55.870
and care for others.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:00.120
All of that is directly linked
to social emotional learning

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.200
and to some of the outcomes that we want.

00:08:03.841 --> 00:08:06.091
(cheering)
