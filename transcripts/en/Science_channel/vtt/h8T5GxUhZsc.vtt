00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.200
Narrator: GLASS FAUCETS ELEVATE
INDOOR PLUMBING TO AN ART FORM.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.834
THE GLASS IS HAND-CRAFTED IN
A RANGE OF SHAPES AND PATTERNS

00:00:11.834 --> 00:00:13.267
FOR VISUAL EFFECT.

00:00:13.267 --> 00:00:16.000
METAL COMPONENTS
ARE FUSED INTO THE GLASS

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.701
TO DELIVER ONE OF
THE NECESSITIES OF MODERN LIFE,

00:00:18.701 --> 00:00:20.400
RUNNING WATER.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.567
GLASS FAUCETS ARE ABOUT
BOTH FORM AND FUNCTION.

00:00:26.267 --> 00:00:28.367
GLASS FAUCETS HAVE
A DELICATE BEAUTY,

00:00:28.367 --> 00:00:30.434
BUT THEY'RE STRONGER
THAN THEY LOOK.

00:00:30.434 --> 00:00:32.567
THE GLASS IS VERY THICK,

00:00:32.567 --> 00:00:37.067
ALLOWING THE FAUCETS
TO HOLD UP TO HEAVY USE.

00:00:37.067 --> 00:00:40.801
MAKING A GLASS FAUCET STARTS
WITH CHUNKS OF CLEAR GLASS.

00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:43.234
A GLASS WORKER LOADS THE GLASS

00:00:43.234 --> 00:00:47.367
INTO AN OVEN
AT 2,190 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.

00:00:47.367 --> 00:00:50.767
ANOTHER WORKER SELECTS BLACK
AND WHITE BILLETS OF GLASS

00:00:50.767 --> 00:00:54.334
TO ADD STRIPES AND PATTERNS
TO THE CLEAR GLASS.

00:00:54.334 --> 00:00:57.934
HE PREHEATS THEM SO THE GLASS
WON'T SHOCK AND FRACTURE

00:00:57.934 --> 00:01:00.567
WHEN EXPOSED
TO HIGHER TEMPERATURES.

00:01:00.567 --> 00:01:01.968
WITH A METAL ROD,

00:01:01.968 --> 00:01:04.067
HE GATHERS A CLUMP
OF THE CLEAR GLASS

00:01:04.067 --> 00:01:05.901
FROM THE MAIN OVEN.

00:01:05.901 --> 00:01:07.501
WITH THE CHUNK OF GLASS,

00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:10.234
HE PICKS UP THE PREHEATED
WHITE CYLINDER,

00:01:10.234 --> 00:01:13.601
SIMULTANEOUSLY EXPOSING BOTH
TO THE FLAMES.

00:01:13.601 --> 00:01:16.667
THIS PROCESS MAKES THE GLASS
FLEXIBLE.

00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:18.968
USING A CURVED WOOD TOOL,

00:01:18.968 --> 00:01:22.100
THE GLASS WORKER GATHERS
THE CLEAR GLASS AT THE BASE

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.467
AND WRAPS IT AROUND
THE WHITE BILLET,

00:01:24.467 --> 00:01:26.400
ENCAPSULATING IT.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.567
HE ATTACHES THE OTHER END OF
THE GLASS TO A SECOND METAL ROD.

00:01:30.567 --> 00:01:36.334
THIS ALLOWS THE GLASS TO STRETCH
AS HE PULLS IT ACROSS THE ROOM.

00:01:36.334 --> 00:01:39.100
THE GLASS IS NOW
OVER 35 FEET LONG

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.868
AND PENCIL-THIN.

00:01:40.868 --> 00:01:43.701
IT STARTS TO COOL
AND SOLIDIFY IMMEDIATELY

00:01:43.701 --> 00:01:45.200
AS IT'S SET DOWN.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.000
THE GLASS WORKERS TAP THE GLASS
AGAINST A PIECE OF METAL

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.501
TO BREAK IT INTO
8-INCH PIECES CALLED CANES.

00:01:53.501 --> 00:01:55.667
THEY SHAPE ANOTHER PIECE
OF CLEAR GLASS

00:01:55.667 --> 00:02:00.067
BY ROLLING IT ON A METAL TABLE
CALLED A MARVER.

00:02:00.067 --> 00:02:02.667
THE GLASS WORKER BLOWS THROUGH
THE METAL ROD,

00:02:02.667 --> 00:02:05.300
CAUSING THE GLASS ON THE END
TO BUBBLE.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.968
IT WILL EVENTUALLY BECOME
THE FAUCET AND TWO HANDLES.

00:02:11.968 --> 00:02:18.033
HE ADDS A LAYER OF BLACK
MOLTEN GLASS TO THE BUBBLE.

00:02:18.033 --> 00:02:19.334
ANOTHER GLASS TECHNICIAN

00:02:19.334 --> 00:02:22.767
ARRANGES THE STRIPED CANES
ON A GROOVED IRON PLATE

00:02:22.767 --> 00:02:27.033
AND HEATS THEM WITH A TORCH.

00:02:27.033 --> 00:02:30.367
MEANWHILE, A GLASS WORKER ROLLS
THE HOT GLASS BUBBLE

00:02:30.367 --> 00:02:33.267
ONTO THE CANES,
WHICH STICK TOGETHER.

00:02:33.267 --> 00:02:35.400
THEN IT'S BACK INTO THE FURNACE,

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.934
AND THE WHITE-STRIPED CANES
MELT INTO THE BLACK BUBBLE.

00:02:39.934 --> 00:02:42.534
NEXT, THE CRAFTSMAN
ROLLS THE GLASS

00:02:42.534 --> 00:02:45.234
ACROSS THE MARVER REPEATEDLY.

00:02:45.234 --> 00:02:49.734
HE PINCHES THE CANES AT THE TOP,
CLOSING THEM AROUND THE BUBBLE.

00:02:49.734 --> 00:02:52.400
THE GLASS IS REHEATED
TO KEEP IT PLIABLE

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.133
AS THE CRAFTSMAN
CONTINUES TO FORM IT.

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:57.801
THE CRAFTSMAN
TRANSFORMS THE BUBBLE

00:02:57.801 --> 00:03:00.434
INTO A HOLLOW GLASS TUBE

00:03:00.434 --> 00:03:06.534
THEN ELONGATING THE TUBE
TO ITS DESIRED LENGTH.

00:03:06.534 --> 00:03:08.267
USING A PINCER-LIKE TOOL,

00:03:08.267 --> 00:03:11.300
HE FORMS THE END
INTO A ROUND HANDLE SHAPE

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.400
WHILE ANOTHER GLASS WORKER

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.100
APPLIES HEAT TO THE GLASS
WITH A TORCH.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.000
THIS KEEPS THE GLASS PLIABLE.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.601
HE THEN CREATES A HOLE
FOR A PIECE OF METAL HARDWARE.

00:03:22.601 --> 00:03:26.000
THEN HE APPLIES MOLTEN GLASS
TO THE METAL HARDWARE

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.567
AND INSERTS THE HARDWARE
INTO THE ROUND FAUCET HANDLE.

00:03:29.567 --> 00:03:34.067
THIS CUTS THE HANDLE FREE
FROM THE REST OF THE GLASS.

00:03:34.067 --> 00:03:35.734
USING A FORMING TOOL,

00:03:35.734 --> 00:03:40.734
THE CRAFTSMAN REFINES
THE SHAPE OF THE GLASS.

00:03:40.734 --> 00:03:44.400
NEXT, HE PREHEATS A METAL MOLD.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.634
THIS STOPS THE HOT GLASS TUBE
FROM FRACTURING

00:03:47.634 --> 00:03:52.467
AS HE BENDS IT AROUND THE MOLD
TO SHAPE IT INTO THE FAUCET.

00:03:52.467 --> 00:03:54.868
ONCE THE FAUCET HAS TAKEN SHAPE,

00:03:54.868 --> 00:03:57.267
IT'S READY TO GO
INTO THE ANNEALING OVEN.

00:03:57.267 --> 00:04:03.000
♪♪

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.968
THE GLASS IS PLACED IN THE OVEN
AT A LOW TEMPERATURE

00:04:05.968 --> 00:04:07.968
AND THEN COOLED.

00:04:07.968 --> 00:04:13.300
THIS PROCESS REMOVES STRESSES
AND STRENGTHENS THE GLASS.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.834
MEANWHILE,
USING HIGH-PRESSURE WATER

00:04:15.834 --> 00:04:18.234
THAT CONTAINS
FRAGMENTS OF GARNET,

00:04:18.234 --> 00:04:20.567
A CRAFTSMAN CUTS
STEEL TRIM RINGS

00:04:20.567 --> 00:04:22.734
AND A DISPLAY PLATE
FOR THE SHOWROOM.

00:04:25.968 --> 00:04:29.200
NEXT, THE CRAFTSMAN INSTALLS
THE GLASS FAUCET

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.701
ON THE DISPLAY PLATE

00:04:30.701 --> 00:04:33.734
BY THREADING A NUT
TO THE FAUCET VALVE.

00:04:33.734 --> 00:04:37.167
HE INSTALLS THE TRIM RINGS
AT THE BASE OF THE HANDLES

00:04:37.167 --> 00:04:39.634
AND ASSEMBLES THEM
TO THE DISPLAY PLATE

00:04:39.634 --> 00:04:41.567
USING THE HARDWARE
THAT'S BEEN FUSED

00:04:41.567 --> 00:04:44.734
TO THE INSIDE OF THE GLASS.

00:04:44.734 --> 00:04:46.434
THE CRAFTSMAN USES A RAG

00:04:46.434 --> 00:04:50.000
TO CLEAN THE FAUCET
OF ANY FINGERPRINTS AND SMUDGES.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.734
FINALLY, CONSTRUCTION
IS COMPLETE.

00:04:52.734 --> 00:04:56.634
THIS UNIQUE GLASS FAUCET
IS READY TO MAKE A STATEMENT.
