00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:35.180
From the beginning, heavy drinking was fairly
commonplace among the cadets at the United

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.710
States Military Academy at West Point (founded
in 1802).

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:45.040
In an attempt to stem this in 1826, the academy’s
strict superintendent and the “Father of

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.330
West Point,” General Sylvanus Thayer, began
a crackdown by prohibiting alcohol on campus.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.500
As Christmas approached and the cadets realized
that the prohibition would put a damper on

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.210
their traditional Christmas Eve festivities
that included consumption of a fair amount

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.490
of eggnog, a bold few began to plan away around
the problem.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.166
Back then, eggnog was always an alcoholic
beverage (see: What is Eggnog Made Of and

00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:07.150
Who Invented It?), often made with rum or
whiskey.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.569
Luckily for the cadets, both liquors were
plentiful near campus, being served by three

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:17.680
taverns within easy travelling distance: Benny
Haven, North’s Tavern and Martin’s Tavern,

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.240
just across the Hudson River.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.810
Determined to make their season bright, a
small cadre of cadets set out to smuggle some

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.599
liquor into the North Barracks and chose Martin’s
Tavern across the river as their supplier.

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:32.899
A few nights before Christmas, three cadets
crossed the Hudson, drank a bit at the bar,

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:36.380
then purchased three to four gallons of whiskey
to go.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.130
They then ferried the contraband back across
the river.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.579
Met at the dock by a guard, they reportedly
bribed him with $0.35 ($7 today) to look the

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:50.130
other way while they unloaded the loot and
snuck it into their rooms where it lay hidden

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.609
until Christmas Eve.

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:56.929
On the fateful night, the superintendent assigned
only two officers to monitor the North Barracks:

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:01.140
Lieutenant William A. Thorton and Captain
Ethan Allen Hitchcock.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.520
Things were quiet at first, and Hitchcock
and Thorton went to bed about midnight.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.899
At about 4 a.m., however, Hitchcock was awakened
by noise coming from one of the cadets’

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:09.899
floors above him.

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.260
Upon investigation, he discovered a small
group of obviously drunk cadets and ordered

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.829
them to return to their rooms.

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:20.380
No sooner had he dispersed that group than
Hitchcock realized there was another party

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.900
in an adjoining room.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.540
Crashing that one as well, Hitchcock found
these cadets so inebriated that he later reported

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.140
they attempting to hide under blankets, and
one even thought he could avoid detection

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.310
by stubbornly keeping his face behind his
hat.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.250
Unlike the first party, however, things got
heated in the second room, and after Hitchcock

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.200
left, the drunk-mad cadets decided to arm
themselves with their bayonets, pistols and

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.099
dirks to attack, and perhaps even kill, Hitchcock.

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.130
Thus began the Eggnog Riot.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.040
While the drunken cadets were gathering their
weaponry, it sounded to Thorton and Hitchcock

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.379
a few floors below as if the parties had simply
resumed.

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:01.430
Returning to the cadets’ floors, Hitchcock
met Jefferson Davis (yes, that Jefferson Davis),

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.590
then a cadet who was also drunk.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.530
Vainly trying to help his friends, Davis burst
into the party-room just ahead of Hitchcock

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.620
shouting: “Put away the grog boys!

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.160
Captain Hitchcock’s coming!”

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.739
Hitchcock soon joined them and ordered Davis
to his room, which likely saved him from later

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.530
expulsion, since he missed out on the remainder
of the riot.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.209
Had he been expelled, of course, his future
in the military and politics, culminating

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.319
in becoming the President of the Confederacy,
likely wouldn’t have ever happened.

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:27.609
(See: What Ever Happened to Confederate President
Jefferson Davis?)

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:31.920
Other cadets who had already made preparations
to attack began assaulting Hitchcock and now

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.879
Thorton, who had joined the fray.

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:37.859
Thorton was threatened with a sword and knocked
down with a piece of wood, while another cadet

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.230
actually shot at Hitchcock.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.359
Realizing things were spiraling out of control,
Hitchcock ordered a cadet sentinel (who apparently

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:49.560
had not been invited to the party) to get
“the ‘com,” meaning the Commandant of

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.829
Cadets; however, in their drunken state the
rioting cadets thought he had summoned regular

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:57.069
army men from a nearby barracks to attack
them.

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.760
Seeking to defend the honor of the North Barracks,
even more cadets armed themselves (in total

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.560
including about one-third of all cadets at
the academy), and, as is standard operating

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.470
procedure in any proper riot, the mob began
arbitrarily breaking anything in sight, including

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.660
windows, furniture and other items.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.660
Eventually, the ‘Com came, and since the
cadets truly respected his authority, they

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:23.380
finally regained a semblance of composure,
and the so-called Eggnog Riot ended sometime

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.380
Christmas day.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.780
Over the next week, Inspector of the Academy
and Chief Engineer of the Army, Major General

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.780
Alexander Macomb, entered Orders No. 49 and
98, the latter of which placed 22 cadets under

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.180
house arrest, and the former began a court
of inquiry.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:45.849
The investigation revealed that the riot caused
$168.83 in damage (around $3,500 today), and

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:51.110
identified 19 ringleaders who were subsequently
court-martialed between January 26 and March

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.940
8, 1827.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.810
Cadets Aisquith, Berrien, Bomford, Burnley,
Farrelly, Fitzgerald, Gard, Guion, Humphreys,

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.080
Johnson, Lewis, Mercer, Murdock, Norvelle,
Roberts, Screven, Stocker, Swords, and Thompson

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.850
stood trial, and other cadets, including both
Jefferson Davis (who was among the 22 originally

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.860
under house arrest, but otherwise went unpunished)
and Robert E. Lee testified for the defenses.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.910
Eleven of the group (Berrien, Bomford, Burnley,
Farrelly, Fitzgerald, Guion, Humphreys, Johnson,

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.199
Lewis, Roberts and Stocker) were dismissed,
and the remainder were allowed to stay, although

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:24.870
Gard, Murdock and Norvelle chose to leave
the academy anyway.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.180
As a result of the riot, in the 1840s when
new barracks were constructed, they were designed

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.860
so that the cadets had to actually go outside
to move between floors in an attempt to prevent

00:05:33.860 --> 00:08:50.010
another mob uprising.
