00:00:05.475 --> 00:00:07.975
(piano music)

00:00:09.578 --> 00:00:12.439
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical age.

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:14.939
Bipedal, naked, large-brained.

00:00:17.632 --> 00:00:21.568
Alone the master of fire,
tools, and language.

00:00:21.568 --> 00:00:24.985
But still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.127
Aware that death is inevitable,
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:34.049
We grow up slowly.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.543
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.543 --> 00:00:39.626
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:41.016 --> 00:00:42.509
We shape the future from our

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:45.259
shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.483 --> 00:00:50.201
Carta brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.201 --> 00:00:54.368
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here.

00:00:56.405 --> 00:00:58.134
An exploration made possible by

00:00:58.134 --> 00:01:00.967
the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:21.515 --> 00:01:24.098
(techno music)

00:01:34.306 --> 00:01:38.473
- So I'm gonna very
specifically talk about modeling

00:01:39.864 --> 00:01:42.947
human evolution remarkably in a dish.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.813
This involves this technology
I talked to you about called

00:01:48.813 --> 00:01:52.980
induced pluripotent cells which
I'll go into in some depth.

00:01:54.503 --> 00:01:57.086
Now, studying evolutionary dish

00:01:58.383 --> 00:02:01.133
has advantages and disadvantages.

00:02:02.218 --> 00:02:05.256
Comparison between humans,
What we are really comparing

00:02:05.256 --> 00:02:09.387
are these particular cell
types not the full organisms.

00:02:09.387 --> 00:02:12.570
But the hope is that, or the belief is

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.926
that much of the critical changes

00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:18.546
that have occurred, occur in the brain,

00:02:18.546 --> 00:02:22.713
and that this transition
point from early brain cells

00:02:23.801 --> 00:02:27.968
to mature brain cells is
that period of maturation

00:02:29.112 --> 00:02:33.515
within a cell lineage, wherein
much of the magic happens

00:02:33.515 --> 00:02:37.117
that will be seen as the known or unknown

00:02:37.117 --> 00:02:40.508
differences between humans
and our closest relatives.

00:02:40.508 --> 00:02:43.526
And as you'll hear, some common themes

00:02:43.526 --> 00:02:46.383
emerging from these
speakers, that these early,

00:02:46.383 --> 00:02:48.748
very early events, there real differences

00:02:48.748 --> 00:02:50.626
that are accruing in the human species

00:02:50.626 --> 00:02:53.819
relative to our common relatives

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.986
Now, the advantage of this
approach is that we can obtain

00:03:00.045 --> 00:03:02.927
a sematic cells, or skin biopsies.

00:03:02.927 --> 00:03:04.653
And now this technology can be done

00:03:04.653 --> 00:03:07.153
with pretty much somatic cell.

00:03:08.016 --> 00:03:11.575
You can obtain them from many species

00:03:11.575 --> 00:03:14.242
in very non interventive manner.

00:03:16.968 --> 00:03:19.583
We've been developing
basically a cellular zoo now

00:03:19.583 --> 00:03:21.639
for the last eight or 10 years,

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:24.889
where we collect biopsies from species,

00:03:26.088 --> 00:03:27.482
a variety of different species,

00:03:27.482 --> 00:03:31.083
and I'll be talking to you
about these species from

00:03:31.083 --> 00:03:34.583
human, bonobo, chimp, gorilla, and rhesus.

00:03:38.896 --> 00:03:41.453
In particular you should
remember that the chimps

00:03:41.453 --> 00:03:46.278
and bonobo share a significant
amount of their genome,

00:03:46.278 --> 00:03:51.058
and yet the brain size
difference between our brains

00:03:51.058 --> 00:03:54.492
and our closest relatives
is really quite striking.

00:03:54.492 --> 00:03:56.091
We'll learn more about that.

00:03:56.091 --> 00:03:58.025
And other differences are that,

00:03:58.025 --> 00:04:01.810
in this last period of seven
billion year when we evolved,

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.718
many of the genes, many
diseases that have evolved

00:04:05.718 --> 00:04:07.497
appear to be unique to humans.

00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:11.178
So along with the acquisition
of the unique features

00:04:11.178 --> 00:04:13.755
that it is to be human,
we've also acquired

00:04:13.755 --> 00:04:16.875
susceptibility to a variety of diseases,

00:04:16.875 --> 00:04:20.569
and so one of the advantages,
or one of the goals

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:21.891
of understanding these cellular

00:04:21.891 --> 00:04:23.954
molecular underlining mechanisms

00:04:23.954 --> 00:04:27.122
that are in involved in
human species evolution will

00:04:27.122 --> 00:04:31.289
tell us about the unique
features of these diseases.

00:04:32.851 --> 00:04:35.869
So in this particular case, we've acquired

00:04:35.869 --> 00:04:39.952
pluripotent stem cells
from a variety of species.

00:04:41.648 --> 00:04:45.009
We take the cultures,
we grow them in dishes,

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:47.195
and treat them exactly the same,

00:04:47.195 --> 00:04:51.028
and we use a series of
chemical modifications,

00:04:51.928 --> 00:04:55.366
instructural modifications
to change these fibroblasts

00:04:55.366 --> 00:04:59.680
into what amounts to
an embryonic stem cell.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.109
And this is called induced pluripotency,

00:05:03.109 --> 00:05:05.963
and in the end we have a series of

00:05:05.963 --> 00:05:10.246
clonal population of cells
that can grow indefinitely,

00:05:10.246 --> 00:05:12.006
and under the right conditions,

00:05:12.006 --> 00:05:15.733
these cells can be induced
to differentiate into neurons

00:05:15.733 --> 00:05:17.782
of a variety of different types,

00:05:17.782 --> 00:05:20.015
and it's this ability to be able to look

00:05:20.015 --> 00:05:21.590
at each of the different stages.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.931
So we can look at the early stages of

00:05:23.931 --> 00:05:26.247
somatic cells as they are growing.

00:05:26.247 --> 00:05:29.931
In a dish as IPS cells,
or as the intermediates

00:05:29.931 --> 00:05:34.098
that lead to differentiation
of different cell types.

00:05:35.586 --> 00:05:38.015
Now, obviously there are limitations,

00:05:38.015 --> 00:05:40.682
and we should be aware of those.

00:05:41.521 --> 00:05:44.738
We're examining intrinsic differences

00:05:44.738 --> 00:05:47.770
that can be detected in
these individual cells.

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.542
There must be a genetic or
an epigenetic event that is

00:05:52.542 --> 00:05:56.709
underlying any phenotype or
difference that we can detect.

00:05:58.634 --> 00:06:01.070
Culture, when I say there
are cultural differences,

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:05.344
in this case I mean tissue
culture, not advanced culture.

00:06:05.344 --> 00:06:09.061
Social experience is something
that's very difficult to,

00:06:09.061 --> 00:06:13.052
we're not going to capture that
social, acquired knowledge.

00:06:13.052 --> 00:06:17.219
Dietary kinds of events are
difficult to completely capture.

00:06:20.438 --> 00:06:22.605
And of course, I'll tell
you a little bit about

00:06:22.605 --> 00:06:27.182
our attempts to get In vivo
context by transplantation.

00:06:27.182 --> 00:06:29.784
And it's really questioned whether or not

00:06:29.784 --> 00:06:33.487
the in vitro relevancy of
phenotypes that we look at,

00:06:33.487 --> 00:06:35.537
how well do they transfer?

00:06:35.537 --> 00:06:38.714
That takes additional
kinds of experiments.

00:06:38.714 --> 00:06:40.556
But what it really comes down to is,

00:06:40.556 --> 00:06:42.594
are there differences that are detectable

00:06:42.594 --> 00:06:44.604
at the cellular level that are relevant

00:06:44.604 --> 00:06:47.619
to the understanding of human origins?

00:06:47.619 --> 00:06:49.567
So there are some basic features

00:06:49.567 --> 00:06:52.317
that we could look at right away.

00:06:53.412 --> 00:06:56.095
We know for example that humans

00:06:56.095 --> 00:06:59.916
have 46 and chimps have 48 chromosomes.

00:06:59.916 --> 00:07:02.916
That they express certain genes that

00:07:03.914 --> 00:07:07.070
identify the most primitive state.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.414
So we can look for those to
make sure that when we do

00:07:09.414 --> 00:07:13.581
the conversion they are
retained within a certain fate.

00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:17.787
We can test weather or not
these embryonic stem cells

00:07:17.787 --> 00:07:22.553
that we get behave equivalently
or not equivalently.

00:07:22.553 --> 00:07:24.353
So it's really important
right at the very beginning to

00:07:24.353 --> 00:07:26.765
determine weather or not we're
seeing differences or not.

00:07:26.765 --> 00:07:30.932
So we can monitor them with a
variety of known differences.

00:07:32.102 --> 00:07:35.061
So here's some simple ways in which we can

00:07:35.061 --> 00:07:37.118
do this more filogically and genetically.

00:07:37.118 --> 00:07:40.451
Determine by carry typing the chromosome

00:07:42.046 --> 00:07:44.648
that are inherent in
weather or not there's any

00:07:44.648 --> 00:07:47.231
gross differences between them.

00:07:48.088 --> 00:07:50.054
Weather or not the cells
grow at the same rate.

00:07:50.054 --> 00:07:52.459
Weather or not they
express the same genes.

00:07:52.459 --> 00:07:56.209
And in our first attempts
at this, years ago,

00:07:59.752 --> 00:08:02.876
we first started by looking
at these immature cells,

00:08:02.876 --> 00:08:05.882
these IPS, what they call
induce pluripotency cells,

00:08:05.882 --> 00:08:08.371
to see if we can determine
any differences between them,

00:08:08.371 --> 00:08:11.797
and we did this by extracting DNA,

00:08:11.797 --> 00:08:13.815
and we'd look for the expression of all

00:08:13.815 --> 00:08:16.342
the genes that were
expressed in these cells

00:08:16.342 --> 00:08:18.360
between all the species
to see weather or not

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.156
we could find any fundamental differences

00:08:20.156 --> 00:08:23.406
that were apparent at that early stage.

00:08:24.362 --> 00:08:28.021
And I won't go through this in any depth,

00:08:28.021 --> 00:08:31.067
but we, back several years ago now,

00:08:31.067 --> 00:08:34.007
we reported that there were features,

00:08:34.007 --> 00:08:37.293
particularly interesting to our lab,

00:08:37.293 --> 00:08:39.661
that there are genetic
elements in the brain

00:08:39.661 --> 00:08:42.475
that have this capacity for hoping around

00:08:42.475 --> 00:08:45.370
or jumping from one location to another.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:49.996
And these genes were very
differently regulated

00:08:49.996 --> 00:08:53.413
in chimps and bonobos relative to humans,

00:08:54.258 --> 00:08:58.425
to the extent that humans
had developed a mechanism

00:08:59.309 --> 00:09:00.881
by expressing two particular genes

00:09:00.881 --> 00:09:03.201
that suppressed the
activity of these lyelms,

00:09:03.201 --> 00:09:08.051
so the amount of new elements
or new genetic material

00:09:08.051 --> 00:09:10.192
that was added into the germ line

00:09:10.192 --> 00:09:12.329
through this particular
vehicle was suppressed

00:09:12.329 --> 00:09:16.496
in humans relative to our
closest relative species,

00:09:17.502 --> 00:09:21.669
and by virtue of the over
expression of these genes.

00:09:23.187 --> 00:09:26.854
We went onto hypothesize
about this and have

00:09:27.786 --> 00:09:32.397
continued working on these
early primitive cells;

00:09:32.397 --> 00:09:35.670
exploring this roll that
these mobile elements play

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:39.670
in carving and crafting
novel phenotypes within,

00:09:40.627 --> 00:09:44.537
not just in humans spices, but
in other organisms as well.

00:09:44.537 --> 00:09:48.620
One interesting point that
I like to make is that

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.987
these line elements is
increasing insertions

00:09:52.987 --> 00:09:55.958
of these pieces of DNA
throughout the genome

00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:59.422
add to the genetic
diversity of the offspring,

00:09:59.422 --> 00:10:01.794
and we as humans have
suppressed this ability

00:10:01.794 --> 00:10:05.961
to add this added element
of diversity which may mean

00:10:07.388 --> 00:10:10.060
a decrease in behavioral
diversity as well,

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.643
limiting our genetic diversity.

00:10:16.349 --> 00:10:19.236
Now this less genetic diversity leads to a

00:10:19.236 --> 00:10:22.399
dependence now more in cultural change for

00:10:22.399 --> 00:10:25.000
adaptation to changes in the environment.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.657
And we are exploring
this as a hypothesis for

00:10:27.657 --> 00:10:32.035
how humans are quite
similar to each other.

00:10:32.035 --> 00:10:34.874
So what I'm going to
talk to about today is,

00:10:34.874 --> 00:10:38.443
in the next few minutes, is about new work

00:10:38.443 --> 00:10:40.198
looking at the next
phase of differentiation

00:10:40.198 --> 00:10:42.050
which are these neural progenitor cells,

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:44.867
and then subsequently neurons.

00:10:44.867 --> 00:10:47.501
So we've developed a
proto call where we can

00:10:47.501 --> 00:10:50.634
generate cells into these very

00:10:50.634 --> 00:10:52.645
homogenous neural proenitors cells.

00:10:52.645 --> 00:10:55.728
They express very unique and features

00:10:57.866 --> 00:11:00.617
that we can compare across spices.

00:11:00.617 --> 00:11:02.620
and there are methodologies
now that allow us

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.179
to use unbiased methods to measure all the

00:11:05.179 --> 00:11:08.624
genetic expression that's
unique to these cells

00:11:08.624 --> 00:11:11.471
and compare them with one another.

00:11:11.471 --> 00:11:14.274
When we do this across all the
spices that we've looked at

00:11:14.274 --> 00:11:17.792
from chimps, bonobos,
gorillas and rhesus vs humans,

00:11:17.792 --> 00:11:20.466
we see 2,000 genes that are differentially

00:11:20.466 --> 00:11:22.708
expressed at a very, very high level,

00:11:22.708 --> 00:11:24.931
and among them when we
look at clusters of genes

00:11:24.931 --> 00:11:28.477
that have categories in
common called gene anthology,

00:11:28.477 --> 00:11:31.548
we find that about a quarter
of those are genes that are

00:11:31.548 --> 00:11:35.960
involved in house cells migrate
within a tissue situation.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.469
So migration, the movement of neurons,

00:11:38.469 --> 00:11:42.190
seems to be a feature that stands out.

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:44.285
So we set up an assay system to measure

00:11:44.285 --> 00:11:45.993
weather or not we could detect that

00:11:45.993 --> 00:11:49.519
genetic difference in a
functional difference.

00:11:49.519 --> 00:11:51.052
This is an assay where the cells are

00:11:51.052 --> 00:11:55.574
plated on a culture dish
and we make a cut here,

00:11:55.574 --> 00:11:57.318
and then we ask who quickly they

00:11:57.318 --> 00:11:59.660
can migrate into there situation,

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:04.150
and we can monitor the cells
as they grow into this,

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.583
and we can color them, and do this in a

00:12:06.583 --> 00:12:10.401
much more high resolution
where we can track each cell

00:12:10.401 --> 00:12:12.856
and look at the direction that it goes.

00:12:12.856 --> 00:12:16.226
When we do this across
multiple species we find

00:12:16.226 --> 00:12:19.895
that humans are much slower
in their migratory pathways,

00:12:19.895 --> 00:12:21.987
so by 12, 24 hours this pathway

00:12:21.987 --> 00:12:25.820
is fully aggregated
together within migration.

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:31.823
Just as another example, we
can look this in another way.

00:12:31.823 --> 00:12:36.137
Looking at migration again
as a feature of these cells,

00:12:36.137 --> 00:12:40.300
we can label the chimp cells
in green, sorry, in red,

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:43.212
and the human cells in green,
and then mix them together,

00:12:43.212 --> 00:12:47.379
and put them at the bottom of
a dish that has microgrooves

00:12:49.288 --> 00:12:51.823
where we can monitor, and has a gradient

00:12:51.823 --> 00:12:54.611
where we monitor rate
at which the cells grow.

00:12:54.611 --> 00:12:56.257
And this allows us to actually

00:12:56.257 --> 00:13:00.053
race our two cells against each other,

00:13:00.053 --> 00:13:02.803
and see how can get there faster.

00:13:03.819 --> 00:13:06.447
We can track again, so it's
another method of this thing.

00:13:06.447 --> 00:13:08.708
So here we have, and it sort of depends

00:13:08.708 --> 00:13:11.032
on when the cells get into the groove

00:13:11.032 --> 00:13:13.873
and then you can start
monitoring how quickly the move.

00:13:13.873 --> 00:13:17.001
So here's a, the green cells
are the human moving along

00:13:17.001 --> 00:13:18.931
the groove, these are the
grooves that they're in here,

00:13:18.931 --> 00:13:20.663
we're watching this cell move along.

00:13:20.663 --> 00:13:23.483
Finally, we get a chimp cell in there,

00:13:23.483 --> 00:13:26.404
and the the chimp cell sort
of takes off and moves.

00:13:26.404 --> 00:13:28.943
Again, evidence, another way in which

00:13:28.943 --> 00:13:32.250
we can begin to monitor these differences.

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:34.541
And when we do thousands of these movies

00:13:34.541 --> 00:13:36.718
we see that both chimp and bonobo

00:13:36.718 --> 00:13:38.661
are really quite similar in their

00:13:38.661 --> 00:13:41.292
rate and direction of trajectory

00:13:41.292 --> 00:13:45.517
as compared to the human which
appears to be much slower.

00:13:45.517 --> 00:13:50.120
In the final assay here we
did a floating assay of cells

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:53.814
that migrate out from the central core,

00:13:53.814 --> 00:13:56.005
and we can measure the core of the cell

00:13:56.005 --> 00:13:57.882
and the distance that the migrate,

00:13:57.882 --> 00:14:02.305
and without much effort you
can see that the human cells,

00:14:02.305 --> 00:14:05.838
while played at the same density,
migrate out over a period

00:14:05.838 --> 00:14:09.887
of time at a much slower rate
relative to the other cells.

00:14:09.887 --> 00:14:13.131
Now as a final assay
for this migration assay

00:14:13.131 --> 00:14:16.539
we took advantage of the
fact we had colored cells,

00:14:16.539 --> 00:14:19.362
and we transplanted them into a mouse

00:14:19.362 --> 00:14:23.012
that had a dilated immune
system, so it didn't recognize

00:14:23.012 --> 00:14:27.153
the species difference between
humans and chimps vs itself,

00:14:27.153 --> 00:14:29.210
se we could transplant these cells

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:31.628
directly into the brain various regions,

00:14:31.628 --> 00:14:35.551
and monitor the rate in
which they were migrating.

00:14:35.551 --> 00:14:38.350
And I should say those of
people that work in this field

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:41.490
know that human cells when implanted

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:43.714
tend to aggregate very closely,

00:14:43.714 --> 00:14:45.984
so we weren't really
anticipating a difference,

00:14:45.984 --> 00:14:47.890
but it's really quite striking.

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:49.988
When we examine these cells

00:14:49.988 --> 00:14:52.419
months after the transplantation,

00:14:52.419 --> 00:14:57.396
We see that there is, but
it was noticed, as soon as

00:14:57.396 --> 00:15:00.362
several weeks afterwards
that the human cells here,

00:15:00.362 --> 00:15:02.268
aggregated around the
side of the injection,

00:15:02.268 --> 00:15:05.959
whereas the chimp cells
migrated at a much greater rate,

00:15:05.959 --> 00:15:08.093
and we could replicate this,

00:15:08.093 --> 00:15:11.445
or we could quantify this
in a very dramatically.

00:15:11.445 --> 00:15:15.612
So we know now that human,
with all these assays together,

00:15:16.651 --> 00:15:18.646
we can convince ourselves
that there really is this

00:15:18.646 --> 00:15:21.882
intrinsic migration
difference which reflected

00:15:21.882 --> 00:15:25.171
in the gene differences that
we can see between them.

00:15:25.171 --> 00:15:27.436
Now that we can transplant these cells,

00:15:27.436 --> 00:15:31.442
we can watch their maturation into cells,

00:15:31.442 --> 00:15:33.771
and the sort of morphological changes

00:15:33.771 --> 00:15:36.390
that happens a neuron as it matures,

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:40.057
is something that is
really well documented.

00:15:41.019 --> 00:15:44.712
And with a wonderful collaboration with

00:15:44.712 --> 00:15:49.068
Katerina Semendeferi, we were
able to, and Bianca Restudent,

00:15:49.068 --> 00:15:52.382
we were able to monitor
these changes in vivo,

00:15:52.382 --> 00:15:55.098
between chimp and human,
and the advantage is that

00:15:55.098 --> 00:15:57.643
we're mixing the cells together
and injecting them in the

00:15:57.643 --> 00:16:01.086
exact site and can monitor
them as they migrate away,

00:16:01.086 --> 00:16:04.000
and then look at them over a period of,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.709
in this case something
like 19, or 19 weeks,

00:16:07.709 --> 00:16:10.776
and we're looking at a variety
of morphological features,

00:16:10.776 --> 00:16:14.665
and strikingly, what we can do is we can

00:16:14.665 --> 00:16:17.518
map each individual cell in brain,

00:16:17.518 --> 00:16:20.947
and look how its, how it
morphologically develops.

00:16:20.947 --> 00:16:23.295
We can see them over
extended periods of time,

00:16:23.295 --> 00:16:25.668
and they're color coded
for us in the Brain,

00:16:25.668 --> 00:16:28.423
so we can see what they, how they change.

00:16:28.423 --> 00:16:31.225
Here you can see, if we
look at dendretic length

00:16:31.225 --> 00:16:34.189
they're pretty much
the same, matching same

00:16:34.189 --> 00:16:37.679
at these early stages, and
then humans dramatically

00:16:37.679 --> 00:16:40.521
take off about six to eight weeks.

00:16:40.521 --> 00:16:42.081
At another time we look at segments,

00:16:42.081 --> 00:16:43.848
that's the number of branches they have,

00:16:43.848 --> 00:16:46.053
also separates that that period.

00:16:46.053 --> 00:16:49.023
And then finally we have
the number of spines,

00:16:49.023 --> 00:16:51.244
these are the features on
each on of the dendrites

00:16:51.244 --> 00:16:54.703
where connects are coming into the cells.

00:16:54.703 --> 00:16:57.077
So we see an accelerated differentiation

00:16:57.077 --> 00:17:00.769
of the neural progenitor cells over time.

00:17:00.769 --> 00:17:02.111
So as a final piece what we did

00:17:02.111 --> 00:17:04.456
is a refunctionale consequence.

00:17:04.456 --> 00:17:06.775
So we can measure measure
actually, the electrical activity,

00:17:06.775 --> 00:17:07.608
weather or not the fire action

00:17:07.608 --> 00:17:10.126
potentials in individual cells.

00:17:10.126 --> 00:17:13.025
And in these new devices
called a multi electrator ray,

00:17:13.025 --> 00:17:15.529
we can play the cells
and then bring them back

00:17:15.529 --> 00:17:17.436
to the ray and monitor their activity,

00:17:17.436 --> 00:17:20.638
how they communicate with each
other over a period of time.

00:17:20.638 --> 00:17:23.432
So they're resting on the
top of these electrodes,

00:17:23.432 --> 00:17:26.289
and we can measure their activity.

00:17:26.289 --> 00:17:27.474
This system actually allows us

00:17:27.474 --> 00:17:29.184
to monitor a variety of features.

00:17:29.184 --> 00:17:31.524
We can measure not just the single spikes,

00:17:31.524 --> 00:17:34.530
but we can measure issues like bursting,

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:37.303
weather or not they
fire in bursts or they,

00:17:37.303 --> 00:17:39.181
weather or not all mini cells that are

00:17:39.181 --> 00:17:42.548
connected to each other
fire at the same time.

00:17:42.548 --> 00:17:44.792
So finally in this last
piece of information

00:17:44.792 --> 00:17:47.041
I'll give you this final data.

00:17:47.041 --> 00:17:49.180
When you read this, here at two weeks,

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:52.114
each one of these is a
channel on which cells exists,

00:17:52.114 --> 00:17:53.710
so here's a, the human cell.

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:57.396
We have a few of them, few
cells in there that are active.

00:17:57.396 --> 00:18:00.754
But clearly at two weeks
the chimp and the bonobo

00:18:00.754 --> 00:18:04.422
are both, many many more cells are active.

00:18:04.422 --> 00:18:05.857
Not only that but you're
seeing some synchroning,

00:18:05.857 --> 00:18:10.421
meaning that cells are actually
connected to each other.

00:18:10.421 --> 00:18:14.903
But by six weeks, here
you have now bursting and

00:18:14.903 --> 00:18:19.070
synchronized activity at a much
higher rate than the chimps,

00:18:20.127 --> 00:18:23.284
evidencing once again that
there's this early event

00:18:23.284 --> 00:18:26.416
where the chimps are, and the
bonobos seem to be maturing

00:18:26.416 --> 00:18:30.408
at an accelerated rate
relative to the humans.

00:18:30.408 --> 00:18:33.092
And we see this reflective
not just in the physiology,

00:18:33.092 --> 00:18:37.362
here the chimps extending
quickly and being bypassed there.

00:18:37.362 --> 00:18:40.112
And again we have this window of time.

00:18:40.112 --> 00:18:42.355
And the way we're beginning
to think about this,

00:18:42.355 --> 00:18:45.880
and I think it's consistent
with many others,

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:50.047
is that in human evolution
there's a developmental delay.

00:18:52.074 --> 00:18:55.473
Retardation is not a
really good word, and or,

00:18:55.473 --> 00:18:57.355
but has been termed as neotenyen,

00:18:57.355 --> 00:18:59.236
and in this case it doesn't fit exactly,

00:18:59.236 --> 00:19:00.914
because we're not
looking at the end point,

00:19:00.914 --> 00:19:04.331
but it is a developmental delay in humans

00:19:05.477 --> 00:19:07.829
in their maturation that's been proposed

00:19:07.829 --> 00:19:09.730
as a possible mechanism
that can contributes

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:12.401
to the rise of many human spices specific,

00:19:12.401 --> 00:19:14.954
including the increase in brain size,

00:19:14.954 --> 00:19:17.900
and emergence of human
specific cognitive traits.

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:22.067
So we and others are interested
in this delay feature,

00:19:23.388 --> 00:19:27.221
and how this delay feature
may result in these

00:19:28.107 --> 00:19:30.340
morphological and genetic
features that we see,

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:32.883
and we'll be talking
more about the mechanisms

00:19:32.883 --> 00:19:35.562
that may control this
sort of delayed event,

00:19:35.562 --> 00:19:39.111
which is so important for human evolution.

00:19:39.111 --> 00:19:42.300
So in conclusion, I hope
I tried to convince you

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:44.800
that the IPS cell approach is,

00:19:45.715 --> 00:19:49.410
we're able to generate
similar type cells in humans,

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:51.752
and in non human primates,
and there's this,

00:19:51.752 --> 00:19:53.623
a significant amount of similarity

00:19:53.623 --> 00:19:57.043
that underlies their maturation,

00:19:57.043 --> 00:20:02.024
but that we also discover
unique features that are,

00:20:02.024 --> 00:20:04.188
now this is important, cell intrinsic,

00:20:04.188 --> 00:20:07.656
cell autonomous, that
we can detect in vitro.

00:20:07.656 --> 00:20:11.311
And this consistent
feature reflexes in the

00:20:11.311 --> 00:20:14.766
migration of the cell, the
maturation of the dendrites,

00:20:14.766 --> 00:20:17.666
as well as the
electrophysiological activity.

00:20:17.666 --> 00:20:22.436
So we think that these
approaches can be used as a model

00:20:22.436 --> 00:20:24.895
to steady the dynamic
developmental comparative

00:20:24.895 --> 00:20:28.855
differences between humans and primates,

00:20:28.855 --> 00:20:31.225
and non human primates, and the difference

00:20:31.225 --> 00:20:35.593
is that this has on an
evolutionary perspective.

00:20:35.593 --> 00:20:38.593
So as usual we have many people to thank,

00:20:38.593 --> 00:20:41.960
the leader of this project,
who's unfortunately

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.535
was not able to attend is Carol Marchetto.

00:20:45.535 --> 00:20:48.598
Variety of people in my own
lab that have more recently

00:20:48.598 --> 00:20:52.681
played a role in various
aspects of the analysis.

00:20:54.401 --> 00:20:58.950
Katerina Semendeferi and
Branka have been key players

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:03.117
in this morphological analysis
that they are experts at.

00:21:04.198 --> 00:21:06.070
I have a variety of people in our

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:08.408
local Carta group that are important,

00:21:08.408 --> 00:21:11.855
and my close colleague El
Sematry who's been with us on

00:21:11.855 --> 00:21:15.204
the beginning, right from
the beginnings on this work.

00:21:15.204 --> 00:21:17.868
And with that I want to
thank you for your attention.

00:21:17.868 --> 00:21:20.118
(applause)

00:21:21.124 --> 00:21:23.707
(techno music)
