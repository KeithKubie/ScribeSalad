00:00:02.903 --> 00:00:03.837
&gt;&gt; Jon: WE'RE BACK.

00:00:03.871 --> 00:00:06.206
WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW."

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.608
SO NICE TO SEE YOU.

00:00:07.641 --> 00:00:09.009
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:11.345
MY GUEST TONIGHT DAVID ROSE
AUTHOR OF "ENCHANTED OBJECTS."

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:14.147
OBVIOUSLY, THOUGH, THE EMMYS.

00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:17.618
COLBERT REPORT. CONGRATULATIONS,
TO THEM. ALWAYS WELL DESERVED.

00:00:17.651 --> 00:00:22.389
ONCE AGAIN. GREAT JOB. BUT
FIRST, OBVIOUSLY, THE BIG NEWS

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:24.157
OF THE LAST FEW WEEKS, THE TOWN
OF FERGUSON, MISSOURI.

00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:27.528
WHERE THE SHOOTING BY POLICE OF
TEENAGER MICHAEL BROWN HAS

00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:33.600
SPARKED A SERIES OF PROTESTS,
WHICH IN TURN SPARKED A LET'S

00:00:33.634 --> 00:00:35.169
SAY STERN RESPONSE BY POLICE
WHO APPEAR TO BE

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:38.372
AUDITIONING FOR
ROBO COP. IT'S A, IT'S A STORY

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:43.777
THAT HAS A LOT OF PEOPLE
OUTRAGED AND UPSET.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:49.216
&gt;&gt; I CAME BACK FROM VACATION
BECAUSE I'M FURIOUS.

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:52.152
&gt;&gt; OF COURSE YOU ARE. AN UNARMED
BLACK TEENAGER GUNNED DOWN

00:00:52.186 --> 00:00:55.889
IN THE STREETS BY POLICE UNDER
SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES.

00:00:55.923 --> 00:01:01.295
WHO WOULDN'T CUT THEIR VACATION
SHORT TO REGISTER THEIR FURY.

00:01:01.328 --> 00:01:05.699
YOU'D HAVE TO BE A MONSTER OR IN
MY CASE ENJOYING A PARTICULARLY

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:06.767
NICE VACATION.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.004
BUT GOOD ON YOU, MR. O'REILLY,
FOR COMING BACK.

00:01:11.038 --> 00:01:13.774
UNLESS OF COURSE YOU'RE FURIOUS
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.

00:01:13.807 --> 00:01:18.979
&gt;&gt; FURIOUS ABOUT HOW THE
SHOOTING DEATH OF 18-YEAR-OLD

00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:24.051
MICHAEL BROWN IS BEING
REPORTED, AND HOW VARIOUS

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:24.418
PEOPLE ARE REACTING TO IT.

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:25.819
&gt;&gt; Jon: YES!

00:01:25.853 --> 00:01:28.922
THAT IS THE OUTRAGE.

00:01:28.956 --> 00:01:33.794
THE SHOOTING OF MICHAEL BROWN
AND ANY LACK OF TRANSPARENCY

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:39.499
FROM THE POLICE DEPARTMENT
RESPONSIBLE FOR SAID INCIDENT IS

00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:42.469
OUTRAGEOUS IN HOW IT HAS BEEN
REPORTED.

00:01:42.503 --> 00:01:45.772
[LAUGHING]
&gt;&gt; AND, I GUESS THAT'S NOT THE

00:01:45.806 --> 00:01:46.773
ONLY REASON TO BE ANGRY.

00:01:46.807 --> 00:01:49.276
&gt;&gt; IS HE GOING TO GET A FARE
SHAKE, THIS OFFICER?

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:50.677
&gt;&gt; THERE HAS BEEN A RUSH TO
JUDGMENT.

00:01:50.711 --> 00:01:51.245
&gt;&gt; ERIC HOLDER FLIES INTO
FERGUSON.

00:01:51.278 --> 00:01:53.847
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:55.649
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, WITH HIS, WITH HIS,
YOU KNOW, SUPER HERO CAPE.

00:01:55.682 --> 00:02:01.021
&gt;&gt; THIS MANTRA OF THE UNARMED
BLACK TEENAGER SHOT BY A WHITE

00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:01.889
COP. YOU KNOW, THAT DESCRIPTION

00:02:01.922 --> 00:02:05.526
IN AND OF ITSELF ACTUALLY COLORS
THE WAY

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:08.495
IN WHICH WE LOOK AT THIS STORY.

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:13.700
&gt;&gt; Jon: YES, DESCRIBING THE
ACTUAL FACTS OF THE CASE.

00:02:13.734 --> 00:02:17.304
[LAUGHING]
&gt;&gt; Jon: REALLY DOES COLOR THE

00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:20.340
WAY WE LOOK AT IT.

00:02:20.374 --> 00:02:24.678
WHITE COP, SHOOTS UNARMED BLACK
TEEN.

00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:26.813
DOES SOUND TERRIBLE.

00:02:26.847 --> 00:02:34.688
WHERE AS SAY HERO COP KILLS
ALIEN HUNTING HUMANS FOR SPORT

00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:38.525
WOULD PUT A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
SPIN ON THINGS.

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:45.165
WHICH THOUGH A VERY ACCURATE
DESCRIPTION OF THE PLOT OF

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:47.634
PREDATOR TWO, IS IN THIS CASE
IS -- NOT WHAT HAPPENED.

00:02:47.668 --> 00:02:51.138
AND, YOU KNOW WHAT THERE ARE SO
MANY OTHER STORIES OUT THERE.

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:53.807
&gt;&gt; WHY AREN'T WE COVERING NEW
YORK.

00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:59.947
&gt;&gt; WHY AREN'T WE COVERING BLACK
ON BLACK CRIME.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.283
&gt;&gt; Jon: YES! WHY ALL THE
INTEREST IN HOLDING POLICE

00:03:03.317 --> 00:03:07.721
OFFICERS TO A HIGHER
STANDARD THAN GANGS?

00:03:07.754 --> 00:03:08.956
THEY BOTH FLASH COLORS. AND,
YES ONE OF THEM HAS BEEN

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.560
SWORN TO PROTECT AND DEFEND, BUT
STILL --

00:03:13.594 --> 00:03:18.232
&gt;&gt; WELL, THIS WEEKEND 42 PEOPLE
WERE SHOT IN CHICAGO.

00:03:18.265 --> 00:03:18.765
YOU KNOW, I DON'T SEE THE
PROTESTS.

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:19.967
I DON'T SEE THE ANGER.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.071
&gt;&gt; IF I WERE AFRICAN-AMERICAN I
WOULD BE OUTRAGED THAT MORE

00:03:24.104 --> 00:03:31.278
JOURNALISTS AREN'T COVERING
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN CHICAGO AND

00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:33.480
MORE OUTRAGED THAT PEOPLE LIKE
AL SHARPTON AND JESSE JACKSON

00:03:33.514 --> 00:03:34.648
DON'T HEAD TO THOSE AREAS.

00:03:34.681 --> 00:03:35.549
&gt;&gt; Jon: YES. WHAT COULD EXPLAIN
THE LACK OF OUTRAGE ABOUT

00:03:35.582 --> 00:03:36.416
AL SHARPTON AND HIS ILK NOT
DOING ANYTHING

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.685
ABOUT BLACK ON BLACK
VIOLENCE IN CHICAGO.

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:40.354
&gt;&gt; WITH CHICAGO'S VIOLENCE
MAKING NATIONAL HEADLINES, A

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:45.459
GROUP LED BY THE REVEREND AL
SHARPTON PLANS TO CONVENE AN

00:03:45.492 --> 00:03:53.200
ANTI-VIOLENCE SUMMIT OF NATIONAL
CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS HERE.

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:54.368
&gt;&gt; Jon: OH, THAT'S RIGHT BECAUSE
AFRICAN AMERICAN LEADERS DID

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:56.370
HOLD A SUMMIT ABOUT THAT IN
NOVEMBER. AND HAVE MET AT

00:03:56.403 --> 00:03:57.604
LEAST THREE TIMES IN THE CITY
IN JUST THE LAST 13 MONTHS.

00:03:57.638 --> 00:03:58.739
WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT IT'S
BEEN EFFECTIVE. BUT TAKEN ALONG

00:03:58.772 --> 00:03:59.907
WITH THE PRESIDENT'S MY
BROTHER'S KEEPER INITIATIVE

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.141
WHICH ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS THIS
VIOLENCE, ALONG WITH THE

00:04:01.175 --> 00:04:02.309
COUNTLESS VIGILS AND MARCHES
WITHIN THESE VIOLENCE TORN

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:06.180
COMMUNITIES MEANS THEY ARE
TRYING ACTUALLY TO DO SOMETHING.

00:04:06.213 --> 00:04:10.350
YOU SEE, YOU BEING IGNORANT OF
THOSE ATTEMPTS DOESN'T MEAN

00:04:10.384 --> 00:04:12.386
THE ISSUE ITSELF IS BEING
IGNORED IN THE SAME WAY THAT

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.656
WHEN IT SNOWS WHERE
YOU LIVE DOESN'T MEAN THE WORLD

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:29.469
ISN'T GETTING HOTTER.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:04:29.503 --> 00:04:31.171
&gt;&gt; Jon: [BLEEP]. OH, YOU KNOW
WHAT? THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE

00:04:31.205 --> 00:04:32.372
BOTHERING YOU, ISN'T THERE?

00:04:32.406 --> 00:04:38.612
&gt;&gt; WHEN A COP PULLS ME OVER I
SAY, I PUT MY HANDS OUTSIDE OF

00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:42.516
THE CAR. IF I'M CARRYING A
WEAPON, WHICH I'M LICENSED TO

00:04:42.549 --> 00:04:43.717
CARRY IN NEW YORK, THE FIRST
THING I TELL THE POLICE OFFICER

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.419
IS "OFFICER I WANT YOU TO KNOW I
HAVE A LEGAL FAREARM IN THE

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:48.355
CAR."

00:04:48.388 --> 00:04:54.494
&gt;&gt; Jon: AND THEN I BRACE MYSELF
FOR THE TASER.

00:04:54.528 --> 00:04:57.931
WELL, WITHOUT GETTING INTO THE
FACT YOU GET PULLED OVER SO MUCH

00:04:57.965 --> 00:05:01.168
BY THE COPS THAT SOMETIMES
YOU'RE CARRYING A WEAPON.

00:05:01.201 --> 00:05:02.135
SOMETIMES YOU'RE NOT. I DON'T
KNOW.

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:04.104
DEPENDS ON HOW I'M FEELING THAT
DAY.

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:05.305
BUT, CONTINUE.

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:11.645
&gt;&gt; I OFTEN WOULD EVEN TAKE MY --
STEP OUT OF THE CAR, LIFT MY

00:05:11.678 --> 00:05:20.721
SHIRT UP SO HE COULD
SEE WHERE THE GUN IS.

00:05:20.754 --> 00:05:29.396
[LAUGHING]
&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU REALLY DO HAVE NO

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:30.163
[BEEP] IDEA, DO YOU?

00:05:30.197 --> 00:05:32.833
YOU REALLY DON'T. BASICALLY,

00:05:32.866 --> 00:05:38.505
BASICALLY YOU'RE SAYING...
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:42.376
IF ONLY MICHAEL BROWN INSTEAD OF
HOLDING

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:47.581
HIS HANDS OVER HIS HEAD HAD
REACHED DOWN TO HIS WAIST ND

00:05:47.614 --> 00:05:54.388
LIFTED UP HIS SHIRT TO SHOW THE
GUN HE DID NOT ACTUALLY HAVE,

00:05:54.421 --> 00:05:57.157
WELL, THIS WHOLE TRAGEDY COULD
OF BEEN AVOIDED.

00:05:57.191 --> 00:06:01.828
DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND THAT LIFE
IN THIS COUNTRY IS INHERENTLY

00:06:01.862 --> 00:06:04.531
DIFFERENT FOR WHITE PEOPLE AND
BLACK PEOPLE?

00:06:04.565 --> 00:06:08.836
&gt;&gt; A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TRYING
MAKE THIS, DANA, ABOUT BLACK AND

00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:10.003
WHITE. AND TRYING TO MAKE THIS
ABOUT RACE.

00:06:10.037 --> 00:06:11.004
&gt;&gt; THIS IS PART OF THIS EFFORT
TO MAKE IT EVERYTHING ABOUT

00:06:11.038 --> 00:06:13.240
RACE.

00:06:13.273 --> 00:06:14.074
&gt;&gt; IS THIS A STORY ABOUT RACE?
DO WE KNOW THAT?

00:06:14.107 --> 00:06:16.610
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S PLACING THE RACE
CARD.

00:06:16.643 --> 00:06:17.711
AND I THINK IT'S DISGRACEFUL.

00:06:17.744 --> 00:06:22.249
&gt;&gt; THE ONLY RACIAL DIVIDE THAT
IS BEING CREATED HERE IS

00:06:22.282 --> 00:06:23.150
BEING CREATED BY
THE RACE HATERS.

00:06:23.183 --> 00:06:27.187
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHO TALKS ABOUT
RACE, RACISTS.

00:06:27.221 --> 00:06:41.702
[LAUGHING]
&gt;&gt; Jon: DID YOU JUST -- HE WHO

00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:44.505
SMELT IT DEALT IT RACISM.

00:06:44.538 --> 00:06:47.641
DID YOU REALLY? YOU SMELT IT
DEALT IT RACISM?

00:06:47.674 --> 00:06:48.408
ALRIGHT.

00:06:48.442 --> 00:06:55.649
[ APPLAUSE ]
&gt;&gt; Jon: FORGET THAT IN

00:06:55.682 --> 00:06:58.886
FERGUSON, 94% OF THE POLICE ARE
WHITE AND 63% OF THE PEOPLE ARE

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:00.487
BLACK, FORGET THAT 92% OF
POLICE SEARCHES AND 86% OF CAR

00:07:00.521 --> 00:07:03.790
STOPS ARE FOR BLACK PEOPLE.
FORGET THAT THE WHITE MUNICIPAL

00:07:03.824 --> 00:07:09.630
GOVERNMENT FINANCES NEARLY A
QUARTER OF ITS ANNUAL BUDGET

00:07:09.663 --> 00:07:10.864
THROUGH THE FINES
DISPROPORTIONATELY LEVELED

00:07:10.898 --> 00:07:11.565
AGAINST THE BLACK POPULATION.
FORGET THAT THE HISTORY OF THIS

00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:12.799
TOWN INCLUDES THIS TASTY NUGGET.

00:07:12.833 --> 00:07:17.838
&gt;&gt; A 52-YEAR-OLD MAN NAMED HENRY
DAVIS SAID THAT FOUR FERGUSON

00:07:17.871 --> 00:07:22.643
POLICE OFFICERS BEAT HIM AND
THEN CHARGED HIM WITH DAMAGING

00:07:22.676 --> 00:07:28.015
GOVERNMENT PROPERTY BECAUSE HIS
BLOOD HAD GOTTEN ON THE

00:07:28.048 --> 00:07:28.982
OFFICERS' UNIFORMS.

00:07:29.016 --> 00:07:30.117
&gt;&gt; Jon: SO, LET ME GET THIS
STRAIGHT. YOU GUYS

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:36.123
HAVE GOT TANKS BUT YOU CAN'T
KEEP A COUPLE OF TIDE STICKS

00:07:36.156 --> 00:07:37.224
AROUND. BECAUSE HERE'S...

00:07:37.257 --> 00:07:39.726
HERE IS THE PROBLEM WITH
EVERYTHING THAT IS GOING ON IN

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.662
THIS CONVERSATION.

00:07:41.695 --> 00:07:45.465
THIS ISN'T ALL ABOUT JUS ONE
MAN KILLED IN ONE TOWN.

00:07:45.499 --> 00:07:52.005
IT'S ABOUT HOW PEOPLE OF COLOR,
NO MATTER THEIR SOCIOECONOMIC

00:07:52.039 --> 00:07:55.209
STANDING FACE OBSTACLES IN THIS
COUNTRY WITH SURPRISING GRACE.

00:07:55.242 --> 00:07:58.912
LOOK AT, LOOK AT HOW UPSET YOU
ALL GET ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS.

00:07:58.946 --> 00:08:03.350
&gt;&gt; TONIGHT CHRISTMAS UNDER
ATTACK.

00:08:03.383 --> 00:08:06.954
&gt;&gt; Jon: WHY ARE WE ALLOWING
ANTI- CHRISTMAS MADNESS?

00:08:06.987 --> 00:08:11.658
&gt;&gt; WHY DO I HAVE TO DRIVE AROUND
WITH MY KIDS TO LOOK FOR

00:08:11.692 --> 00:08:12.893
NATIVITY SCENES AND BE LIKE,

00:08:12.926 --> 00:08:18.298
OH YA, KIDS, LOOK THERE BABY
JESUS BEHIND THE FESTIVUS POLE

00:08:18.332 --> 00:08:18.899
MADE OUT OF BEER CANS.

00:08:18.932 --> 00:08:19.967
IT'S NUTS!
&gt;&gt; REMEMBER...

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:27.274
&gt;&gt; Jon: REMEMBER, YOU WERE
FURIOUS THAT AMERICA'S

00:08:27.307 --> 00:08:33.247
11 MONTH LONG CELEBRATION OF
CHRISTMAS WASN'T ENOUGH. BUT

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:37.784
NOW IF YOU CAN, JUST IMAGINE
THAT INSTEAD OF HAVING TO SUFFER

00:08:37.818 --> 00:08:46.827
THE INDIGNITY OF A FESTIVUS POLE
BLOCKING SOMETHING YOU COULD

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:53.734
HAVE JUST SET UP IN YOUR OWN
YARD ANYWAY -- IMAGINE THAT

00:08:53.767 --> 00:08:59.706
INSTEAD OF THAT ON A PRETTY
CONSISTENT BASIS YOU CAN'T GET A

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:02.376
[BEEP] CAB EVEN THOUGH
YOU'RE A NEURO SURGEON,

00:09:02.409 --> 00:09:03.577
CAUSE YOU'RE BLACK.
I GUARANTEE YOU.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:10.584
I GUARANTEE YOU THAT EVERY, I
GUARANTEE YOU THAT EVERY, THAT

00:09:10.617 --> 00:09:16.356
EVERY PERSON OF COLOR IN THIS
COUNTRY HAS FACED AM INDIGNITY

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:23.063
FROM THE RIDICULOUS, TO THE
GROTESQUE, TO THE SOMETIMES

00:09:23.096 --> 00:09:25.299
FATAL AT SOME POINT IN
THEIR -- I'M GONNA SAY

00:09:25.332 --> 00:09:27.234
LAST COUPLE OF HOURS. BECAUSE OF
THEIR SKIN COLOR.

00:09:27.267 --> 00:09:28.335
QUICK STORY.

00:09:28.368 --> 00:09:31.905
SO WE LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY.

00:09:31.939 --> 00:09:34.842
A LIBERAL BASTION.

00:09:34.875 --> 00:09:38.712
RECENTLY -- LET ME FINISH.

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:42.916
RECENTLY WE SENT A CORRESPONDENT
AND A PRODUCER TO A BUILDING

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:45.452
IN THIS LIBERAL BASTION WHERE WE
WERE GOING TO TAPE AN INTERVIEW.

00:09:45.485 --> 00:09:52.059
THE PRODUCER, WHITE, DRESSED IN
WHAT COULD ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS

00:09:52.092 --> 00:09:58.465
HOMELESS ELF ATTIRE, AND A
PRETTY STRONG 5:00 O'CLOCK FROM

00:09:58.498 --> 00:10:01.101
THE PREVIOUS WEEK SHADOW.

00:10:01.134 --> 00:10:08.475
STRODE CONFIDENTIALLY INTO THE
BUILDING PROCEEDING OUR HUMBLE

00:10:08.509 --> 00:10:12.446
CORRESPONDENT, A GENTLEMAN OF
COLOR, DRESSED RESPLENDENTLY IN

00:10:12.479 --> 00:10:14.314
A TAILORED SUIT. WHO DO YOU
THINK WAS STOPPED?

00:10:14.348 --> 00:10:15.215
LET ME GIVE YOU A HINT: THE
BLACK GUY.

00:10:15.249 --> 00:10:16.450
AND THAT [BLEEP] HAPPENS ALL OF
THE TIME.

00:10:16.483 --> 00:10:17.150
ALL OF IT.

00:10:17.184 --> 00:10:18.252
RACE IS THERE.

00:10:18.285 --> 00:10:19.386
AND IT IS A CONSTANT.

00:10:19.419 --> 00:10:23.123
YOU'RE TIRED OF HEARING ABOUT
IT?

00:10:23.156 --> 00:10:26.560
IMAGE HOW [BEEP] EXHAUSTING IT
IS LIVING IT.

00:10:26.593 --> 00:10:28.362
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
