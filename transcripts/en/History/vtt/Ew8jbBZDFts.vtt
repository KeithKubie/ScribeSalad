00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.830
[music playing]

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:04.270
I sure lucked
out with how many

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.700
dandelions there are here, even
though I don't care for them.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.570
There's something
happening when I stand up,

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.030
and I'm getting
these head rushes.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.170
They worry me a little bit.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.800
I know I had head rushes
bad on Vancouver Island,

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.170
but not that bad.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.300
I'm hoping they'll go away.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.830
Well, I harvested quite
a bit of dandelion.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.700
So let's go fishing.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.000
Head rush, head rush--

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.600
how come I get a head rush?

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.630
I need some fish, man,
lots and lots of fish.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.070
[bleep]

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.770
That was a big one too.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.370
God, that's disappointing.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.530
Come on man, I need more fish.
Let's go.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.530
Please, Mongolia, please
let me get this fish, eh?

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.270
I got one.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.700
Thank you.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.670
Oh, [bleep], yeah!

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:31.670
Yeah!

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.130
[bleep], yeah!

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.600
Whoa!

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.070
Yeah!

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.530
Yeah!

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.870
Whoo!
Whoo!

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.730
Oh, thank you, Mongolia.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:53.570
Thank you, Mongolia.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.330
Oh, a head rush, head rush.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.400
Time to cook up some vittles.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.830
What I needed, morale
booster, nourishment--

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.630
I mean, I just can't
say enough about it.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.970
Whoa.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.930
Oh.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.900
Well, that was a pretty
intense head rush.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.970
I've never had a head
rush like this before.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.130
This is the worst
one I've ever had.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.870
I blacked out.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.000
I hit my head, just
very, very glancing.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.630
But it could have
been pretty bad.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.070
I'm laying on my back.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.430
And I'm staring at
the sky thinking, that

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.730
is a really blue, pretty sky.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.870
And then slowly, my
brain fog starts to lift.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.000
And I realize I'm in
Mongolia, and I'm on my back,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.230
and I just fell.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:46.370
I think those dandelions have
been dehydrating me pretty bad.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.700
The problem is I think those
dandelions are a diuretic,

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.070
which makes you pee.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.400
And if they make you
pee, then they're

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.230
keeping my urine color clear.

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.200
So I'm thinking that I'm
hydrated when I'm really not.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.730
I'm hoping that cutting
the dandelions out

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.430
of my diet, at
least temporarily,

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.430
will correct these head rushes.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:21.900
It's disconcerting to tip
over from a head rush.

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.730
So that's something that
I really need to watch.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.300
Something small can
turn into something big

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.300
out here in the wilderness
if you let it go.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.770
We are out in the
middle of nowhere.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.400
If you do something
catastrophic,

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.400
you're just screwed.
