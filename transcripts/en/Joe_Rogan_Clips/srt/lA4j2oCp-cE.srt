1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,920
I'm just terrified. Terrified. I'll be
one of you guys out there every day. Yeah.

2
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:09,390
All right. Now I know five friends would
go out every day. You, you're one of them.

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,360
Other guys. I do too. Every
time they get a chance.

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:16,500
The guys I play with Google every
day. Yeah. If you could pull it off.

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,100
It's like a gentleman's leisure
way of life. Yeah. You know,

6
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,910
it's always back when I was a club comic,
that's how I killed today.

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,780
Guys started playing with was like 13
and so I would just go to a golf course

8
00:00:27,781 --> 00:00:30,960
and you know, schmooze out a deal where
I could play golf there every day.

9
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:35,180
And you ain't Jack Shit to do during the
day and clubs for 15 years. You know,

10
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:40,190
I'm doing 48 weeks and making 500 a week
or whatever it was when I started and

11
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,720
it was a middle act out there. You had
to work them all. You're, you know,

12
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,650
cause you do the $500 real bad. Yeah.
Do you ever look back on those days?

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,570
Look like to reminisce?
I, you know what, I, it,

14
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,520
it's a good thing for me that this
was the path of least resistance,

15
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,900
right? Because, uh, it
goes, everyone for stand up,

16
00:01:03,901 --> 00:01:08,580
I'd be a regional marijuana distributor
in the state of Texas, in a, in a,

17
00:01:08,581 --> 00:01:12,960
in an industry that has some
questions coming up. So, uh, you know,

18
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:17,880
I did it because I loved it,
but it was also fun, fun,

19
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:21,810
fun, you know. Uh, and, uh,

20
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,880
and it was easy for me.

21
00:01:23,881 --> 00:01:28,881
I didn't mind the travel because
I like drinking free and bars and,

22
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:34,140
and, uh, and, and, you know, did, you
know, practicing this art form and,

23
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:39,090
you know, and I, but I never ever thought
it would, you know, go where it went,

24
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:43,830
you know, if, you know, people ask me,
well, how do I do that? I'm like, wow,

25
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,670
I did it. And I was right there
when it happened. I have no idea.

26
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,410
I barely remember it. Did you live in
Mexico for a little bit? [inaudible]

27
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,410
and factors that really,
really,

28
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:59,900
really good PGA player from
the same town I lived in, uh,

29
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,940
that played golf every
day where I played golf.

30
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,180
I didn't know him young,
he would have been,

31
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,780
let's figure it out. It
would've, he would've been,
he's like 21 or two now. And,

32
00:02:12,781 --> 00:02:17,770
uh, he was in, he was on the, in the heat
for this tournament name. Uh, Abraham,

33
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:22,060
my answer is his name and, uh,
born in Reynosa Mexico ways.

34
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:25,070
They actually born across the border
because there's no wall. Right.

35
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,420
They can just come over there
and have the baby so that, and,

36
00:02:27,421 --> 00:02:31,800
but his parents must've been fairly
well off for that part of the world,

37
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:37,260
you know, to do that. But he's great.
He's great and not dig it because,

38
00:02:37,261 --> 00:02:40,350
uh, I, you know, and I see where
he came from exactly. You know,

39
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,450
it's where my son made a hole in one,
it was eight years old,

40
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:46,890
was on the capacity golf course and
rhinos and microcode holds in one as a guy

41
00:02:46,891 --> 00:02:50,910
getting his career.
Uh,

42
00:02:50,911 --> 00:02:55,050
I've had one of my sons had one,
you know,

43
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,340
[inaudible] like I like the
big guys, maybe 16, 17, 18.

44
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:04,390
The whole lot in a whole lifetime
does no equivalent in other sports.

45
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:09,180
Yeah. Yeah. We're all in one. There's no
equivalent in any other game right there.

46
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,950
There was a double eagle.
The uh, what's that mean?

47
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,710
That's where you make a two on a par five.

48
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:20,370
So that means you sunk a whole
firm to 60 to 262 yards out.

49
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:25,660
You made it on the second shot.
There's very rare,

50
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,740
very rare,
but dumb legal,

51
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,470
slightly less rare than Hohenwarter.

52
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,640
Way less rare.
Way less rare because a whole,

53
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:40,150
because that par three could be
as much as 125 yards, you know?

54
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,680
And then most of them aren't made on
the longer one 85. But know you're not,

55
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,730
you guys like me aren't hitting
the par threes from two 35.

56
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,530
And if you think about it,
I kissed this.

57
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:55,531
Nothing like that in any other game or
sport whole in one where it just works

58
00:03:56,141 --> 00:04:00,270
out perfect.
Maybe your walk off Grand Slam or yeah.

59
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,840
Maybe this happened way more often
than, yeah, way more. Well, yeah,

60
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:07,560
way more often than the hole in one for
how many people try it every, you know,

61
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:10,840
you don't get many chances
at that Grand Slam.

62
00:04:10,841 --> 00:04:14,620
But how many people tried to
have anything may pitch at you.

63
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,510
You're definitely going to hit the ball.

64
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,030
It's right there like that
golf ball's just right there.

65
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:22,000
I mean you might not have a good lay,
but you're definitely going to hit it.

66
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:25,480
Am I saying all the right? Yeah. Well if
you hit a foul ball, you got to play it.

67
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:29,200
You got to go find it and yeah,
it's just,

68
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:34,201
it seems like the odds of you getting
a hole in one must be off the charts.

69
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:38,780
It must be like 1,001 or
100,001 or something crazy
like that. Yeah, maybe. I mean,

70
00:04:38,781 --> 00:04:40,790
but most people may maybe never,
you know,

71
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,090
what do you think the numbers
numbers would be? What are the odds?

72
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:49,110
Oh Fuck Jalil in one [inaudible] let's
throw the math to those carb guys.

73
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,910
Those signs. Two days they were
killing me buddy. But my, yes,

74
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,830
my son made one the 11th day ever played
golf in front of me and his coach and

75
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:03,230
his best friend and know,
and it was a 95 yard,

76
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:07,570
part three from the regular women's
cheese where the US kids club,

77
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,380
a driver that I still have. Wow. And uh,

78
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:14,700
and it just straight at the hall.
He had a great golf swing.

79
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,340
Kids if you treat them or you know,
he's,

80
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,470
his golf coach was good even though they
spoke a different language. Uh, they,

81
00:05:20,471 --> 00:05:23,680
they understood golf and how
to teach him that showing.

82
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,350
And so he was good at it and he
didn't really play much anymore.

83
00:05:26,351 --> 00:05:28,380
He decided staying but,
uh,

84
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,780
bad at 10 yards in front of the pen,

85
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:35,920
bounced twice roller right in the middle
of the cup. And I know at this point,

86
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:39,730
I've been playing golf for 30 years
and I'd never done it. Wow. And, uh,

87
00:05:39,731 --> 00:05:40,960
so it was a big deal.

88
00:05:40,961 --> 00:05:43,900
And he got his name and a couple of
newspapers and they mentioned him on the

89
00:05:43,901 --> 00:05:44,711
golf channel.

90
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,960
He was the youngest kid that had
made a hole in one that year that was

91
00:05:46,961 --> 00:05:50,190
registered and then like two weeks later,
a six year old tits.

92
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:55,000
And my son was like, uh, you know, they
took all the joy out of it for him. Yeah.

93
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:59,290
That was one kid. He was lucky hit
his, went on an off a mailbox. You're,

94
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,580
you're just going off a perfect golf shot,
golf shot. It's a hard thing to learn,

95
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:09,140
right. That swing, Eh, you know, it is
a really difficult thing to do and it's,

96
00:06:09,141 --> 00:06:12,350
it's just a,
it's a thing that you learn how to aim.

97
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:16,010
It's like a bow and Arrow, you know, uh,

98
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:20,030
even though that's a little easier
to teach somebody how to do,

99
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:25,010
but to do it exceptionally
well, you know, it's, it's,

100
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,940
it's not easy to do and a and,
or a sling shot,

101
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:33,470
how to get the power at the right spot or,
or even flat casting.

102
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:38,090
It's not power everywhere.
It's power in the right spot that does it.

103
00:06:38,091 --> 00:06:41,840
And whip of the risks.
Yeah. And, uh, so it's,

104
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:46,490
it's, it's hard to do, but it's
fun to do once you, once you,

105
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:50,900
once you learn how to hit a good solid
golf shot and the ball comes off the way,

106
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:54,950
as opposed to it's, you know, it's
bliss. I'll tell you something. Here's,

107
00:06:54,951 --> 00:06:59,180
here's the story about golf.
My best friend who passed
away died of brain cancer.

108
00:06:59,181 --> 00:07:04,181
So they had done a surgery on him that
it had just Dan scars down his neck,

109
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:08,420
down his back where they were trying
to Harvard. They were, you know,

110
00:07:08,421 --> 00:07:11,940
they were shooting it, you know,
he was already, you know, he had,

111
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,750
he should have had a death sentence.
We just weren't saying it out loud.

112
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,770
And we were, uh, at by plays
and Montecito, and, uh,

113
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,740
we had thrown everything at this cancer,

114
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:26,210
but the kitchen sink and we were looking
for the fucking thing, you know, and, uh,

115
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:31,310
and Steve Goes, let's go golf course, man.
Uh, he goes, I'll help you read some pots.

116
00:07:31,311 --> 00:07:32,270
He was always good at reading.

117
00:07:32,271 --> 00:07:34,310
Puds we'd been playing golf
since we were little kids.

118
00:07:34,311 --> 00:07:38,300
We'd known each other since
we were six. And, uh, and, uh,

119
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,940
so when I got my clubs at
his clubs were in there too,

120
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,200
so he reached into his pill bag and
takes another pill of pain pill and said,

121
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:51,050
after all mine on there, you
know, I'm not taking a swing. So,

122
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:56,720
and he did off the first tee box and
it hurt and it wasn't very good. And,

123
00:07:56,721 --> 00:07:59,750
uh, and, and he just went and, uh,

124
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:03,260
but every once in a while he'd put a ball
down and he's hit it and we get to the

125
00:08:03,261 --> 00:08:07,070
17th hole is a par 367 yards as long.
Oh.

126
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:11,540
And he hits his drive with his,
with his driver and, and uh,

127
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,750
and it fades off a little bit to
the rapid he caught it. And, uh,

128
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:17,900
so it was up kind of by
the world up by the green,

129
00:08:17,901 --> 00:08:21,760
but the was kind of on the other side. And
I was like, great, you know, didn't, uh,

130
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,160
and so he hits a chip shot, which is
easier to do. And he's always really,

131
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,440
really been good at that. And he hits
it to about seven feet. And I'm like,

132
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:34,280
oh my God,
he's got a seven foot putt for par.

133
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:35,683
And he makes it,

134
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,560
and this Diane man gets the biggest
grant I've ever seen in my life.

135
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,830
And it was crooked because
his muscles had been cut,

136
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,100
but it just brought him pure fucking joy.

137
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:54,290
And then I got to see the last par he ever
made. So, and uh, I got to witness that,

138
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,070
you know, joy. That's pretty cool.

139
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:59,310
Awesome. That's pretty cool. That's
golf, you know, it can, you know,

140
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,110
if it means that much to you,
you know,

141
00:09:01,111 --> 00:09:03,750
it can make you feel better if you
do it right. One time. I get it.

142
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,930
I think it's like in any
difficult game like that,

143
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,300
I guess it'd be like
that with a lot of games,

144
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:10,610
but there's something about golf to there.

145
00:09:10,611 --> 00:09:13,350
It's very physical and
you're doing it outside.

146
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,680
It's one of the only things you have
to do outside, you know, other than,

147
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:20,340
I guess you could do Tennyson's
I'd like really, right.

148
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,490
But golf is a fucking giant ass course.
You're going to be walking.

149
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,300
You gotta go outside.
