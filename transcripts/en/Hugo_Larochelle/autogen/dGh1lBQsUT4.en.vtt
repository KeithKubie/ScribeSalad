00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.150
 this capsule we will be reducing the 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.790
 gradient concept ten matches so one 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.210
 has already said previously that one of 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.820
 disadvantages of gross representation 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.830
 pictures form a painting for dear 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.630
 with a building every pixel it was 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.430
 that could cost to the memory arts is 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.539
 also one actually contained more 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.289
 information that could we 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.970
 interest so well in practice it 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.500
 there is a lot of research that 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.599
 still tries to work that this 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.099
 representation there to try to 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.980
 extract and find automatically 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.680
 that she and extract it information 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.879
 useful to extract from the picture had there is 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.480
 other approaches that rather go 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.640
 try to find by hand a 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.200
 representation of the image that will 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.480
 really only extract 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.059
 relevant information for a 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.579
 given application is what we will see 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.289
 in this capsule it is an operation 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.449
 which is often used to extract 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.219
 different types of representations 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.690
 image that are used in many 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.690
 computer vision systems 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:12.689
 then we will take as an example the 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.159
 problem of extracting the outline of 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.710
 shapes in an image 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.900
 so if we had this image if of a 3 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.330
 we could interest you in just 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.670
 have the outline of 3 so only 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.759
 have the information where are the 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.409
 pixels that delineates the outline of the 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.470
 character 3 that was drawn here so 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:36.420
 a way to do that it could be 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.610
 try to see which are among others 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.820
 horizontal variations ie 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.060
 what are the pixels or at each pixel 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.820
 from how far does the 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.460
 pixel value varies in this 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.549
 direction is a way of doing things 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:57.180
 that would be to see at each position 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:00.060
 and j a pixel and see what is the 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.630
 difference between the peak will be the position 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.750
 rigid and its pixels just right so 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.780
 at the position at the row eemeaa the 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.319
 column 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.940
 what's more I'm going to say and 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.300
 the next annotation i'm going to call his 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.959
 after 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:20.680
 this table the capital H and here we have in 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:26.770
 does the result of this calculation so by 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:30.400
 example we have here the value of x ore g14 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:34.270
 and the crown 15 months x then d 14 and 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.430
 column 14 and so we actually see 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.239
 that there are fairly high values ​​in 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.700
 places like here or here 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:45.130
 here also also here where there are 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.550
 fairly high variations on an axis 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.550
 horizontal 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:54.190
 we prefer the same thing now on 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.410
 the vertical axis and so in this case also 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.440
 a position he lies in our table 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:05.110
 20 in the vertical what we would calculate 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:08.260
 that's the difference between the value in 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.989
 the image at the row put there and the 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.930
 column j - the word of pixel art 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:16.480
 angeli and the column I have so the 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.220
 variations in this direction love 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.709
 so again we have values 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:25.959
 high enough here then 6 here too 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.549
 high value where actually we have a 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.519
 peak holy wolf at this position there 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:34.650
 in the vertical direction we have a 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.650
 high variation in pixel intensity 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:40.560
 so a first approach to extract 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:44.200
 an account at the ca to be fair 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:47.910
 consider that a pixel belongs to a 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.829
 outline if the sum of the variations 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.810
 horizontal and vertical is high but 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:54.940
 no since the variation is signed in 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.209
 does it bring us more than the 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.140
 version be positive or negative 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.840
 so what we're going to do is we're going 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.420
 take the variation in watch variations 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.070
 vertical for the square meter 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.109
 we travel is also the variation 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.820
 but on the horizontal axis then we will re 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:11.260
 too much because also allowing the square 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.109
 that makes it positive or negative 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:17.109
 it is associated in reality 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:20.320
 finally to normalize if we want one 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.079
 can take square root is what we 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.120
 will call 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.280
 how but in our table here and j 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.199
 have from this error there we 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.960
 could just apply a threshold 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:32.210
 so if they propose a threshold of 128 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.650
 here we make sauce after someone 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.270
 in our table 1 we see 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.530
 that actually all the pixels that are 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:42.460
 find approximately on the contour 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:45.530
 of the form defined by my character 3 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:48.139
 has a value that exceeds the threshold so 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.659
 a value of 2.1 to what we 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:52.009
 ask really wanted so because 

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:59.750
 that it's a pretty good job for 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:05:00.379
 to detect the tale calmly and to all 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.789
 its operations 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:03.949
 what does that have to do with the notion 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:05.750
 gradient that we saw when talking 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:07.159
 of a function that we calculate and 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.039
 partial derivatives and then putting them 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:11.210
 to the rectors called this vector there the 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:13.550
 gradient so why are we 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.529
 is talking about a gradient image and well 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.750
 the idea is actually that we can see this 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:20.150
 calculation there as a kind of estimate 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.490
 gradients on a function f is going to be 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:26.090
 the function associated with the image that we 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:28.039
 gives for a position a and b 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:31.610
 what is the value of the intensity of the 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:33.590
 pixel at this position there so 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.620
 for example if we took our function 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:39.889
 pictures here that gives us chicken pox at 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:44.509
 position a and b are done this is the 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:45.949
 drift and partial compared to b so 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:48.349
 by definition our the hard life 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:50.210
 partial function that would present 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:52.520
 of parameters a and b are done by 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.940
 ratio to b only that corresponds to the 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.069
 limit 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:06:00.409
 when we have a destiny a gap that tends 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:06:05.419
 to zero of f2 a and b plus the difference - f2 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:08.240
 ab divided by the size of the state and if 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:11.180
 we take a delta equal to 1 of his 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.729
 decides apprentices 6 me this calculation of 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:16.159
 partial there after the delta equal to 1 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:19.039
 we notice the similarity here we have 

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:22.610
 actually in place of more +1 daltons 

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:26.060
 here who lies in my advanced math 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:28.400
 the equivalent of a and b here is so my 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.469
 calculation of horizontal variations this is 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:33.810
 a bit as partial said of this 

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:36.210
 image function there but relative to 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:39.570
 the variable that corresponds to an index 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.560
 of columns of the pixel in an image then 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:45.210
 in the same way are made relative 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:48.750
 to with delta equal to 1 we have this derby 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:51.030
 partial there one could see have taken a 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.650
 calculation approximations taking delta equal 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:55.800
 at 1 and so finally looking at the 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:57.810
 pixel right down so a row in 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.330
 down in my picture 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:02.460
 ok so for that reason we can 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:05.430
 see the vertical variations and 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:08.040
 horizontal as approximations of 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:11.639
 the drift and partial of a function 

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:20.450
 picture in any position 

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:22.950
 yj and if we see h and v as a 

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:25.620
 calculating partial lifts in a 

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:28.080
 function images in a good image of 

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:31.889
 put them together like that in a 

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:33.960
 vector so at the position and j-jaures 

00:07:31.889 --> 00:07:35.760
 two elements that would correspond the 

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.830
 first let's say the variations in total 

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:40.200
 second vertical variations so in 

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:42.060
 this table logis for his igis I would have 

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:44.010
 actually a vector and it's a 

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:47.820
 image gradient because here we had 

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:49.830
 actually making approximations of the 

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:52.440
 drift and partial of the function 

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:53.910
 images at the same time what is it 

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.830
 can do the gradient there since it's 

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:57.930
 a vector we could visualize it 

00:07:55.830 --> 00:08:01.560
 then we are vector saint laurent park 

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:03.240
 to have fun visualizing this vector there 

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:08.970
 to each of the pixels in an image 

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:11.160
 given for example 6-2 bruno guigue 

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:12.780
 so we have a first image here with 

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:17.600
 a certain textures and for 

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:19.950
 different pixels we drew the 

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:25.280
 vector which corresponds gradient of 

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:27.389
 the image at this pixel here and here what we have 

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:30.330
 it's the same picture but with a 

00:08:27.389 --> 00:08:31.860
 illumination with - illumination so 

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:33.690
 we can imagine that this image 

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:35.889
 it's the result of taking this picture 

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:39.639
 here but two 

00:08:35.889 --> 00:08:42.009
 maybe in cast iron or with less 

00:08:39.639 --> 00:08:44.709
 of light on the image not so we're going 

00:08:42.009 --> 00:08:47.639
 to say that the picture -10 me nation in 

00:08:44.709 --> 00:08:51.689
 does that here values ​​of pixels that 

00:08:47.639 --> 00:08:54.329
 are closer to zero than here 

00:08:51.689 --> 00:08:58.720
 first thing we can notice 

00:08:54.329 --> 00:09:00.489
 is that the orientation ie 

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.379
 gradient language does not change between 

00:09:00.489 --> 00:09:04.139
 both images 

00:09:01.379 --> 00:09:08.290
 actually if we look for example 

00:09:04.139 --> 00:09:10.499
 for example this gradient here here the same 

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:13.119
 gradient the same vector is here 

00:09:10.499 --> 00:09:13.980
 notice his angle is exactly the 

00:09:13.119 --> 00:09:17.319
 even 

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:20.769
 finally all that has changed is the 

00:09:17.319 --> 00:09:23.980
 gradient standard so actually the 

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:27.239
 gradian here the vector it is longer 

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:29.859
 hanoi is more serious than the gradient here 

00:09:27.239 --> 00:09:34.179
 so in this representation the 

00:09:29.859 --> 00:09:37.299
 case have managed to factorize or 

00:09:34.179 --> 00:09:38.919
 to distinguish the information on the 

00:09:37.299 --> 00:09:41.110
 amount of illumination that is going 

00:09:38.919 --> 00:09:43.329
 influence the names of the vectors the 

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:47.709
 language of the gradients and that she has a 

00:09:43.329 --> 00:09:50.379
 son configuration of the structure or of 

00:09:47.709 --> 00:09:52.239
 the shape finally of the image to a 

00:09:50.379 --> 00:09:56.049
 given place so how much what 

00:09:52.239 --> 00:09:56.529
 the pixels varies in this place of 

00:09:56.049 --> 00:09:58.449
 the image 

00:09:56.529 --> 00:10:00.489
 so that's going to be a calculation that will us 

00:09:58.449 --> 00:10:02.019
 to distinguish these two 

00:10:00.489 --> 00:10:03.549
 information there so what if by 

00:10:02.019 --> 00:10:05.829
 example we're going to be a variant at the 

00:10:03.549 --> 00:10:08.410
 amount of disposal for example if we 

00:10:05.829 --> 00:10:10.660
 did object recognition the 

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:13.839
 quantity of appointments should not 

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:18.189
 change our ability to recognize a 

00:10:13.839 --> 00:10:20.610
 object in an image the calculation of his 

00:10:18.189 --> 00:10:24.459
 vectors there so the image gradients 

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:27.699
 will already allow us to illuminate 

00:10:24.459 --> 00:10:29.350
 offense of eliminating information 

00:10:27.699 --> 00:10:31.149
 on disposal for example taking 

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:32.589
 all vectors and normalize them 

00:10:31.149 --> 00:10:34.539
 so years will ensure for all the same 

00:10:32.589 --> 00:10:35.739
 no it's something we're going 

00:10:34.539 --> 00:10:37.779
 explore later is a property 

00:10:35.739 --> 00:10:41.579
 which is interesting that we will want 

00:10:37.779 --> 00:10:41.579
 exploit for image gradients 

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.540
 so let's go a little more in detail 

00:10:43.709 --> 00:10:48.420
 on commenting on what one calculates 

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:49.920
 image gradient there is what we will see 

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:51.990
 what we will be able to calculate from 

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.959
 an operation called the 

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:56.420
 two-dimensional correlation 

00:10:53.959 --> 00:10:58.769
 so I could start by explaining 

00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:00.420
 the operation of correlation by those 

00:10:58.769 --> 00:11:03.690
 on board were commenting on what 

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:06.570
 calculates the horizontal and 

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:08.760
 vertical from a correlation so 

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:12.560
 a coloring of the dimensions between a 

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:15.930
 value table x1 the other table 

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:19.620
 double life this table actually we're going 

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:21.750
 call it a filter or a kernel and we're going 

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:23.940
 use for correlation the symbol 

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:27.329
 etoilists so the calculation of a 

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:31.440
 correlation that corresponds to taking 

00:11:27.329 --> 00:11:34.260
 our filter here to position it to 

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:36.029
 all parties all positions 

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:40.410
 possible in the image so for example 

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:41.730
 you can position it here and 

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:43.560
 when we're cool, we'll do a 

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:49.199
 multiplication element by element 

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:50.850
 cofres 0 x 0 and there we would add the 

00:11:49.199 --> 00:11:54.269
 amendment to the rules of the other 

00:11:50.850 --> 00:12:01.380
 value in at the position of the film so 

00:11:54.269 --> 00:12:05.730
 we would do more 255 x 10.5 + 0 x 10.5 which 

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:07.529
 is over 155 x 0 he would take 

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:10.740
 this value there and position it in 

00:12:07.529 --> 00:12:12.230
 a table officials results years 

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:16.940
 delay 

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:16.940
 symbol it may be a star 

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:23.519
 no full canvas like that so they the 

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:28.709
 resulting value of this calculation at 0 x 0 

00:12:23.519 --> 00:12:32.279
 255 30,500 points 5 255 x 0 it was 

00:12:28.709 --> 00:12:35.399
 would position at the given location in the 

00:12:32.279 --> 00:12:37.589
 result table of my correlation so 

00:12:35.399 --> 00:12:41.100
 it means that this value if it is 

00:12:37.589 --> 00:12:44.310
 calculated by doing this calculation there with the 

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:46.370
 filter at this position if this value 

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:50.670
 if we will rather be calculated at 

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:53.069
 position the filter like this here and if 

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:55.010
 so you are this value if it would be 

00:12:53.069 --> 00:12:58.750
 calculated in positional 

00:12:55.010 --> 00:13:01.160
 filter at this position 

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:04.130
 this is the case for all 

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:06.740
 possible positions for our filter w 

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:13.010
 in image x and that it corresponds to 

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:14.960
 calculations of a principle correlation 

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:16.700
 on the code to make a little more 

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.360
 explicit the definition of a 

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.490
 correlation 

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:23.120
 then we have a filter w that is us 

00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:24.590
 given in one extract the size of the filter 

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:29.240
 in question is there all the positions 

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:30.230
 and j possible in my chart being my 

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.450
 picture on which I am a 

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:35.020
 correlation so we see that here we have a 

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:38.090
 iteration to the highest value 

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:41.810
 that can be achieved by taking into account 

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:46.460
 the height then the width of the 

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:49.430
 filter we take there under image so the 

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:51.650
 picture window in at the position 

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:53.030
 eligible and we multiply the winds 

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:54.950
 by mistake by our filter and then 

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:57.200
 finally we do the sum and are 

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:59.870
 placed in the table results of 

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:02.390
 our relationship will have here it's really 

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:04.420
 just to explicitly illustrate 

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:06.650
 that she is calculating a correlation 

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:09.770
 this says the calculation in python like that 

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:12.140
 these sails approach the most effective is 

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:13.670
 in fact a disadvantage of invoking 

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:15.950
 correlations of said like that is it 

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:17.990
 there are libraries that are in 

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:19.580
 able to do this calculation there so 

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:20.720
 very effective and among others it's even 

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:22.520
 possible to do this kind of calculation 

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:28.250
 very effectively using 

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:29.960
 graphics cards for example gpu and 

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:32.240
 finally one last operation 

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:34.550
 often sees in computer vision if 

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:36.710
 that of convolution in two 

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:39.290
 dimensions as its own symbol 

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:41.060
 mathematical this is actually this 

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:42.260
 operation there it's very similar the 

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:43.460
 correlation 

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.530
 the difference is that when we go 

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:48.260
 access the filters the point of 

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:51.380
 reference when computing indexes goes 

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:53.930
 be started in the last row and the 

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:56.270
 last column so for example his 

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:56.860
 venom calculate this element so in our 

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:59.990
 board 

00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:03.470
 at that moment so we stop 

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:05.900
 reposition our filter here and in 

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:06.700
 this case also when we wanted to do the 

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:09.940
 calculation 

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:12.430
 the talent here we would have taken a 

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:14.860
 first value in teaching 

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:16.810
 of image or our title is positioned and 

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:19.750
 we compare them with morals 

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:22.060
 0-0 counting from this 

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:23.650
 cell so what are we going to do in 

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:26.430
 is that we will reverse the tidy 

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:32.350
 the columns so now the element 

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:34.720
 00 will be here the element so in 

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:38.800
 do I'm going to write it like this here so 

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:43.510
 normal reindeer 0-0 1-1 or six stopovers 

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:45.040
 mans 0-1 supplement 1 0 1 1 but with the 

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:46.780
 convolution to the fact it's going to be one 

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:48.400
 so that's going to be the row of 

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:50.320
 redheads it's going to be row 1 

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:52.840
 and if it's going to be column 06 it's going 

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:54.670
 to be the column so when we go 

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:57.700
 want to calculated with our son 

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:59.920
 positioned here we will multiply this 

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:02.080
 value there with the element 0-0 with our 

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:03.880
 age index that starts at this position 

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:08.410
 so that's going to be multiplied by 

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:10.480
 the zero here after that my 255 kidal 

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:12.010
 relative position 0.1 in my 

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:17.650
 bleeding can be compared with 

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:21.850
 the greens at position 0.01 

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:24.880
 here we have here then two alone 

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:27.040
 elements that will be found here so at the 

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:29.830
 position 1 0 will be compared with the 

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:32.050
 position 1 0 but with my big point of 

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:35.080
 reference therefore to his positions here and 

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:37.930
 finally this element so is going to be 

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:39.790
 doubled in one that is found 

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:43.870
 now here in the operation of 

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:50.800
 convulsions I tell myself piece 0 by 0.255 

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:53.290
 by 0.50 here by 251 loses 0.5 and 255 by 

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:55.390
 zero here and she manages the sum of everything 

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:58.120
 only that will give me one more 128 

00:16:55.390 --> 00:17:00.460
 we notice the result in what 6 of 

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:03.910
 the convention is exactly the same as 

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:06.820
 the correlation so that's going to happen that 

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:08.500
 sometimes and that's due to the fact that I 

00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:10.480
 even if I say as a point of reference 

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:13.000
 there in the rows the last column 

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:14.770
 it turns out that all my accesses a 

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.209
 disk gives the same result as I 

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:17.180
 start with the reference point here 

00:17:16.209 --> 00:17:19.040
 or that I com 

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:20.120
 if they put in general it's not 

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:22.310
 necessarily one that no convolution 

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:27.890
 gave the same result as our 

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:29.810
 correlation this being said a relationship 

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:32.690
 between the two in fact we could more 

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:34.280
 lie as a convolution from a 

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:35.390
 code that we would have that will execute a 

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:37.400
 correlation and all we will have 

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:39.470
 case actually it went to our 

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:41.810
 correlation operation a new movie 

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:44.600
 but we reversed the order of 

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:47.120
 rows and one of the columns so we have 

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:48.680
 a version written in python here my 

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:51.410
 convolution could call my 

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:53.660
 correlation where I will take my filter w 

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:56.360
 and all I will do what for the 

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:58.580
 the first clue is 12th and say I 

00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:00.200
 just take the basques 

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:04.070
 also the rows and in this case also 

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:05.990
 the columns so we can lift 

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:08.600
 think a little bit you'll see that 

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:10.100
 this is the ranking operation 

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:12.470
 reversed rows of columns and 

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:14.480
 also corresponds to use as 

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:17.330
 reference point the last element 

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:19.190
 row of last column sometimes the 

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:21.170
 result of a convolution is going to be the 

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:23.030
 same as the correlation is the case between 

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:25.300
 others if the filter is symmetrical 

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:28.310
 horizontally and vertically 

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:30.320
 so this is a condition that involves 

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:32.480
 that the convention will give the same 

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:33.980
 result that the correlation in 

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:37.960
 the previous example by cons 

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:40.760
 had a filter that was like that here 

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:42.590
 and in this case this chair not 

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:45.380
 symmetrical nor horizontally and 

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:46.520
 vertically however it is 

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:48.230
 that when we reverse 

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:50.630
 firstly the rows then the 

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:53.030
 columns we get the same leaves so 

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:58.070
 this condition also is not a 

00:18:53.030 --> 00:19:01.410
 necessary condition for the 

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:04.830
 correlation in the same result 

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:06.480
 than the convolution hall but it's up to 

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:08.940
 because of the rate that is enough that's 

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:12.560
 a condition that is sufficient 

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:12.560
 for the eight-piece composition
