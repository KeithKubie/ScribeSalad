well we have a variety of controls of

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:08.590
well we have a variety of controls of
 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.020
well we have a variety of controls of
course the the the main mode of control

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.030
course the the the main mode of control
 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.450
course the the the main mode of control
has to do with our degree of knowledge

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:15.460
has to do with our degree of knowledge
 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.440
has to do with our degree of knowledge
and understanding of the world as you

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:19.450
and understanding of the world as you
 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.320
and understanding of the world as you
change how you what you know about the

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.330
change how you what you know about the
 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.400
change how you what you know about the
world you change how you're going to

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410
world you change how you're going to
 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.550
world you change how you're going to
control your perception for example and

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560
control your perception for example and
 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.070
control your perception for example and
and you also learn about what you want

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:32.080
and you also learn about what you want
 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.520
and you also learn about what you want
to pay attention to and what you don't

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530
to pay attention to and what you don't
 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.459
to pay attention to and what you don't
so that those are very important very

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:38.469
so that those are very important very
 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:41.029
so that those are very important very
important aspects and you can create

00:00:41.029 --> 00:00:41.039
important aspects and you can create
 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:44.910
important aspects and you can create
techniques that sort of technique is

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920
techniques that sort of technique is
 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.279
techniques that sort of technique is
probably a little bit too much but you

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:47.289
probably a little bit too much but you
 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:49.529
probably a little bit too much but you
you you create strategies that allow you

00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:49.539
you you create strategies that allow you
 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:53.610
you you create strategies that allow you
to filter things that you don't want for

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620
to filter things that you don't want for
 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.799
to filter things that you don't want for
example right now in order to pay

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809
example right now in order to pay
 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.840
example right now in order to pay
attention to what you're asking me and

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850
attention to what you're asking me and
 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.360
attention to what you're asking me and
to pay attention to what is going on in

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370
to pay attention to what is going on in
 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.160
to pay attention to what is going on in
my mind I'm trying to filter out things

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170
my mind I'm trying to filter out things
 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.690
my mind I'm trying to filter out things
that are happening around me that have

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700
that are happening around me that have
 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.310
that are happening around me that have
to do with the lights that have to do

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320
to do with the lights that have to do
 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.120
to do with the lights that have to do
with the technicians and and so on and

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130
with the technicians and and so on and
 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.330
with the technicians and and so on and
that's part of the control and then

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340
that's part of the control and then
 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.390
that's part of the control and then
there's a level of control that I would

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400
there's a level of control that I would
 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.980
there's a level of control that I would
like to describe with the word the

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990
like to describe with the word the
 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.490
like to describe with the word the
liberation and which has to do with

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500
liberation and which has to do with
 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.920
liberation and which has to do with
something that you don't do online you

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930
something that you don't do online you
 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.180
something that you don't do online you
do actually offline when you rather than

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190
do actually offline when you rather than
 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.110
do actually offline when you rather than
perceiving the outside world you sort of

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120
perceiving the outside world you sort of
 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.130
perceiving the outside world you sort of
step into yourself into your mind space

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140
step into yourself into your mind space
 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.620
step into yourself into your mind space
and you you imagine what is I mean you

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630
and you you imagine what is I mean you
 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.320
and you you imagine what is I mean you
reimagine what is happening you consider

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330
reimagine what is happening you consider
 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.520
reimagine what is happening you consider
a problem you analyze how the problem

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530
a problem you analyze how the problem
 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.560
a problem you analyze how the problem
can be solved you think about options

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570
can be solved you think about options
 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.120
can be solved you think about options
and so on everything that we normally

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130
and so on everything that we normally
 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.190
and so on everything that we normally
described as higher-level reasoning

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200
described as higher-level reasoning
 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.350
described as higher-level reasoning
decision-making and creativity you know

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360
decision-making and creativity you know
 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.040
decision-making and creativity you know
these are processes that cannot be done

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050
these are processes that cannot be done
 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.860
these are processes that cannot be done
online they're done offline but of

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870
online they're done offline but of
 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.740
online they're done offline but of
course have an enormous influence on how

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750
course have an enormous influence on how
 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.680
course have an enormous influence on how
the brain is going to work now

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690
the brain is going to work now
 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.270
the brain is going to work now
to have an influence directly on how the

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280
to have an influence directly on how the
 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.089
to have an influence directly on how the
brain is firing neurons right now that's

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099
brain is firing neurons right now that's
 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.399
brain is firing neurons right now that's
a very different story of course there

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409
a very different story of course there
 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:25.809
a very different story of course there
there are ways of influencing it with

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819
there are ways of influencing it with
 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:32.180
there are ways of influencing it with
states of altered perception some that

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190
states of altered perception some that
 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.369
states of altered perception some that
are in the or control like say different

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379
are in the or control like say different
 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.309
are in the or control like say different
kinds of meditation and some there are

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319
kinds of meditation and some there are
 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.619
kinds of meditation and some there are
whether the control of say medications

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629
whether the control of say medications
 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.789
whether the control of say medications
drugs whatever but that's really about

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799
drugs whatever but that's really about
 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:47.470
drugs whatever but that's really about
it so in other words the the control is

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480
it so in other words the the control is
 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.770
it so in other words the the control is
considerable when you think about say

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780
considerable when you think about say
 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.849
considerable when you think about say
long-term goals the way you react to the

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859
long-term goals the way you react to the
 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:59.149
long-term goals the way you react to the
world you can construct guidelines for

00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159
world you can construct guidelines for
 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:02.330
world you can construct guidelines for
how you would desire to operate how you

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340
how you would desire to operate how you
 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.970
how you would desire to operate how you
think it's ideal and try to institute

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980
think it's ideal and try to institute
 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.979
think it's ideal and try to institute
that and then you have ways in which

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989
that and then you have ways in which
 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.910
that and then you have ways in which
they char sort of probably less

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920
they char sort of probably less
 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.789
they char sort of probably less
effective in which you just control what

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799
effective in which you just control what
 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.830
effective in which you just control what
is happening on the moment like trying

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840
is happening on the moment like trying
 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.159
is happening on the moment like trying
to curb an excessive emotional reaction

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.169
to curb an excessive emotional reaction
 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:25.190
to curb an excessive emotional reaction
or something of the sort
