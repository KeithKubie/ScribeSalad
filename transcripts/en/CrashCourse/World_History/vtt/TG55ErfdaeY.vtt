Hi there my name’s John Green; this is Crash Course
World History and today we’re going to talk about Jesus.

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:09.539
So this is a Roman coin from around the time
Jesus was born in the Roman Empire, and it

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:14.250
calls Augustus, the emperor, the son of God.
So let’s just state at the outset that in

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.920
4 BCE, being the son of God, or at least being
the son of a god was not such an unusual thing.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.140
But a poor Jew being the son of God — that
was news.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:33.260
[Theme Music]

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.400
Any understanding of Christianity has to start
with Judaism, because Jesus was born a Jew,

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.960
and he grew up in the Jewish tradition. He
was one of many teachers spreading his ideas

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.710
in the Roman province of Judea at the time,
and he was part of a messianic tradition that

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.809
helps us understand why he was thought of
not only teacher but something much, much more.

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:51.410
Let’s go straight to the Thought Bubble
today.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.880
The people who would become the Jews, were
just one of many tribal peoples eking out

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.540
an existence in that not-very fertile crescent
world of Mesopotamia after the agricultural revolution.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.920
The Hebrews initially worshiped many gods,
making sacrifices to them in order to bring

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.100
good weather and good fortune. But they eventually
developed a religion centered around an idea

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.159
that would become key to the other great western
religions.

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:17.060
This was monotheism, the idea that there is
only one true god (or at least that if there

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.329
are other gods around, they are total lameoids).
The Hebrews developed a second concept that

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:26.209
is key to their religion as well: the idea
of the covenant, a deal with God.

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:30.999
The main man in this, the big macher was Abraham.
Not to make this too much of a scripture lesson,

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:34.670
but it’s kind of hard to understand the
Jews without understanding Abraham, or Abram

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.099
as he was known before he had his big conversation
with God. Recorded in Genesis 17: "When Abram

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:46.009
was ninety years and nine, the LORD appeared
to Abram, and said unto him, 'I am the Almighty

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.689
God; walk before me, and be thou perfect.'
" And I’m a make a covenant with you and

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:52.740
a bunch of cool things will happen like you’re
gonna have kids and your descendants will

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.669
number the stars and you can have all the
land of Canaan forever, it’s gonna be awesome.

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:58.729
I’m paraphrasing by the way, Thought Bubble.

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.489
So God promised that Abram would have kids
with his wife even though the dude was already

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:08.209
like 99, but there was a catch: "This is my
covenant, which ye shall keep, between me

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:14.481
and you and thy seed after thee; every man
child among you shall be circumcised." Keep

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.870
it PG-13, Thought Bubble.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.520
Now that is asking a lot from a guy, especially
a 99-year-old geezer like Abram living in

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.310
a time before general anesthesia. But those
were the terms of the deal, and in exchange

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.200
God had chosen Abraham and his descendants
to be a great nation. From this we get the

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.870
expression that the Jews are the Chosen people.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.110
Thanks for keeping it clean, Thought Bubble.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.100
So, some important things about this god:

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.190
One, singularity. He — and I’m using the
masculine pronoun because that’s what Hebrew

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.780
prayers use — does not want you to put any
gods before Him.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.450
He is also transcendent, having always existed
and he is deeply personal – he chats with

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.480
prophets, sends locusts, etc. But he doesn’t
take corporeal form like the Greek and Roman Gods do.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.880
He is also involved in history, like he will
destroy cities, and bring floods, and determine

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.870
the outcome of wars, and possibly football
games. Stan, no! FOOTBALL games!

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.600
Probably most important to us today, and certainly
most important to Jesus, this god demands

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.380
moral righteousness and social justice. So,
this is the god of the Hebrews, Yahweh, and

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.490
despite many ups and downs, the Jewish people
have stuck with him for- according to the

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.710
Hebrew calendar, at least- over 5700 years.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.000
And He has stuck by them too, despite the
Jews being, on occasion, something of a disappointment

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.319
to him. Which leads to various miseries, and
also to a tradition of prophets who speak

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:32.250
for God and warn the people to get back on
the right path lest there be more miseries.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.800
Which brings us back to our friends, the Romans.
By the time that Jesus was born, the land

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.130
of the Israelites had been absorbed into the
Roman Empire as the province of Judea. At

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.970
the time of Jesus’s birth, Judea was under
the control of Herod the Great, best known

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.280
for building the massive temple in Jerusalem,
that the Romans would later destroy.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.000
And by the time Jesus died, an expanded Judea
was under the rule of Herod Antipater. Also,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.120
unhelpfully, known as Herod. Both Herods ultimately
took their orders from the Romans, and they

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.540
both show up on the list of rulers who are
oppressive to the Jews, partly because there’s

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.319
never that much religious freedom in an empire.

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:10.399
Unless you are, wait for it... The Mongols
[Mongoltage]

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.460
or the Persians. Also, they were Hellenizers,
bringing in Greek theater and architecture,

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.620
and rationalism. And in response to those
Hellenistic influences, there were a lot of

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.340
preachers trying to get the Jews to return
to the traditions and the godly ways of the

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.469
past, including the Sadducees, and the Pharisees,
and the Essenes, and the Zealots.

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:31.120
And one of those preachers, who didn’t fit
comfortably into any of these four groups,

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.389
was Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus was a preacher
who spread his message of peace, love and,

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:40.829
above all, justice, across Judea over the
course of his actually average-length life for his time.

00:04:40.829 --> 00:04:46.020
He was remarkably charismatic, attracting
a small but incredibly loyal group of followers,

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.740
and he was said to perform miracles — although
it’s worth noting that miracles weren’t

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.539
terribly uncommon at the time.

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:56.199
Jesus’s message was particularly resonant
to the poor and downtrodden and pretty radical

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:00.430
in its anti-authoritarian stance. He said
it was easier for a camel to get through the

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.330
eye of a needle than for a rich man to get
to heaven, he said the meek were blessed,

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.029
that the last would be first and the first
would be last — all of which was kind of

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:13.169
threatening to the powers that be, who accordingly
had him arrested, tried and then executed

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:16.309
in the normal method of killing rebels at
that time: crucifixion.

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:20.860
Also, just to put this question to bed, the
Romans crucified Jesus, because he was a

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:28.120
threat to their authority. Later traditions saying that the
Jews killed Jesus? Very unfortunate, also, very untrue.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.520
We’re not going to discuss Jesus’s divinity,
because:

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:35.460
1. This isn’t a theology class, and
2. Flame wars on the Internet make me so uncomfortable that

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.629
I have to turn to camera 2. Hi there camera
2, I’m here to remind you that

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:42.599
3. Fighting over such things, like fighting
over whether the proverbial cake is a lie,

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:46.749
rarely accomplishes anything, plus
4. What matters to us is the historical fact

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:52.449
that people at the time believed that Jesus
was the Messiah, the Anointed One, the son

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:56.210
of God. And they believed that he would return
some day to redeem the world.

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.379
Which leads us to two questions about Christianity:

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:02.909
First, Why did this small group of people
believe this? And second, why and how did

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:05.370
that belief become so widespread?

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.309
So why would people believe that Jesus was
the Messiah?

00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:11.339
First. The Jews had a long tradition of believing
that a savior who would come to them in a

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:15.939
time of trouble. And Judea under the rule
of Herod and the Romans... definitely a time of trouble.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.680
And many of the prophecies about this savior
point to someone whose life looks a lot like

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:24.699
Jesus's. For instance, Isaiah 53 says the
person will be misunderstood and mistreated,

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:29.639
just like Jesus was: “He was despised, and
rejected by men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:35.580
with grief: and as one from whom men hide
their face he was despised; and we didn't respect him.”

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.520
And a lot of the prophecies like Daniel 7:14,
for instance, explained that when the Messiah

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:44.259
comes there will be this awesome, new, everlasting
kingdom. And that had to sound pretty good

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:46.589
to people who’d had their autonomy taken
away from them.

00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:50.039
So some religious Jews saw Jesus in those
prophecies and came to believe either during

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:54.289
his life or shortly thereafter, that he was
the messiah. Most of them thought the new

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:58.599
everlasting kingdom was right around the corner,
which is probably why no one bothered to write

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:03.259
down much about the life of Jesus for several
decades, by which time it was clear that we

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:06.659
might have to wait a bit for this brilliant
new everlasting kingdom.

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:10.180
I should note, by the way, that the idea of
a messiah was not unique to the Jews at the

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.930
time. Even the Romans got in on the action,
for instance, the Roman poet Virgil wrote

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:18.289
of a boy who: “Shall free the earth from
never-ceasing fear, he shall receive the life

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:22.699
of gods, and see Heroes with gods commingling.”
Sound familiar?

00:07:22.699 --> 00:07:26.889
But Virgil was writing about Emperor Augustus
in that poem, not Jesus, which points again

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:31.409
to the similarities between the two. Both
called sons of God. Both sent to free the

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:35.809
earth from never-ceasing fear. But one ruled
the largest empire in the world; and the other

00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:39.979
believed that empire, and the world, needed
to change dramatically.

00:07:39.979 --> 00:07:45.009
So why did the less wealthy and famous son
of God become by far the more influential?

00:07:45.009 --> 00:07:47.629
Well, here are three possible historical reasons:

00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:52.309
Reason #1: The Romans continued to make things
bad for the Jews. In fact, things got much

00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:59.329
worse for the Jews, especially after they launched
a revolt between 66-73 CE, which did not go well.

00:07:59.329 --> 00:08:03.220
By the time the dust settled, the Romans had
destroyed the Temple and expelled the Jews

00:08:03.229 --> 00:08:06.829
from Judea, beginning what we now know
as the Jewish Diaspora.

00:08:06.829 --> 00:08:10.680
And without a Temple or geographic unity,
the Jews had to solidify what it meant to

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.809
be a Jew and what the basic tenants of the
religion were. This forced the followers of

00:08:14.809 --> 00:08:18.749
Jesus to make a decision: were they going
to continue to be Jews following stricter

00:08:18.749 --> 00:08:22.460
laws set forth by rabbis, or were they going
to be something else.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.659
The decision to open up their religion to
non-Jews, people who weren’t part of the

00:08:25.659 --> 00:08:30.199
covenant, is the central reason that Christianity
could become a world religion instead of just

00:08:30.199 --> 00:08:33.940
a sect of Judaism. And it probably didn’t
hurt that the main proponent of sticking with

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:37.880
Judaism was James, Jesus’s brother, who
was killed by the Romans.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.830
Reason #2: Is related to Reason #1 and it’s
all about a dude named Saul. No, not that

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:45.820
Saul. Yes, Saul of Tarsus, thank you.

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:50.090
Saul, having received a vision on the road
to Damascus, became Paul and began visiting

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:55.040
and sending letters to Jesus followers throughout
the Mediterranean. And it was Paul who emphatically

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:59.320
declared that Jesus followers did NOT have
to be Jews, that they did not have to be circumcised

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.770
or keep to Jewish laws or any of that stuff.

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:05.030
This opened the floodgates for thousands of
people to convert to this new religion. And

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:08.320
the other thing to remember about Paul is
that he was a Roman citizen, which meant that

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:12.030
he could travel freely throughout the Roman
Empire. This allowed him to make his case

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:15.790
to lots of different people and facilitated
the geographic spread of Christianity.

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:23.090
Oh, it’s time for the open letter? Alright.
An open letter, to the fish.

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:28.860
But first, lets see what’s in the secret
compartment today. Oh, Stan. It’s my favorite

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:34.430
album Jesus Christ Superstar, finally available
in my favorite format, the cassette. Did I

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:37.950
color-coordinate my shirt to Jesus Christ
Superstar? Yes.

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:41.680
Dear Ichthys, So check this out: In the first
century when it was still super underground

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:46.260
and hipster to be a Christian, you were a
secret symbol of Christianity, used to kind

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:50.600
of hide from the Romans. Ichthys, the Greek
word for fish, was an acronym and it was a

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:55.820
super clever way to talk about religion without
anyone knowing that you were talking about it.

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:58.540
But you’ll never guess what happened - even
in places where it’s completely fine to

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:02.550
talk about Christianity now and to use, you
know, regular Christian symbols, like the

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:07.300
cross, you have had a huge resurgence thanks
to the plastic automobile decal industry.

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:11.740
I mean seriously, Ichthys, I haven’t seen
a comeback like this since Jesus.

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.300
Best wishes, John Green

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:17.710
And lastly, Christianity was born and flourished
an empire with a common language that allowed

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:21.520
for its spread. And crucially, it was also
an Empire in decline.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.720
Like even by the end of the first century
CE, Rome was on its way down. And for the

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:29.120
average person, and even for some elites,
things weren’t as good as they had been,

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:33.300
if fact they were getting worse so fast that you
might have thought the end of the world was coming.

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:36.940
And Roman religion offered no promise of an
afterlife, and a bunch of squabbling whiny

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:42.660
gods - sorry if I offended adherents to Roman
religion, but seriously, they squabble. So

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:46.600
even though early Christians were persecuted
by the Roman Empire and sometimes fed to the

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.790
lions and other animals, the religion continued
to grow, albeit slowly.

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:54.870
But then as the Roman decline continued, Emperor
Constantine allowed the worship of Jesus and

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:58.420
then eventually converted to Christianity
himself. And then the religion really took

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:01.640
off. I mean, Rome wasn’t what it used to
be, but everybody still wanted to be like

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:05.170
the Emperor. And soon enough there was a new
son of God on coins.

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:07.150
Thanks for watching. See you next week.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.930
The show is written by my high school history
teacher Raoul Meyer and myself and our graphics

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:16.290
team is Thought Bubble.

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:19.610
As only 62 million of you guessed last week,
the Phrase of the Week was "Chipotle Burrito";

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:23.260
if you want to guess at this week’s Phrase
of the Week or suggest future ones, you can

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:27.460
do so in Comments where you can also ask questions
about today’s video that will be answered,

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.150
hopefully, by our team of historians.

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:32.730
Thanks for watching Crash Course, and as we
say in my hometown, Don't Forget To Be Awesome.

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:35.160
Ow... again.
