National Parks have been

bears and wolves, the park's
most abundant large mammal

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:30.630
is the elk who's migration
paths reach well beyond

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:34.430
Yellowstone's boundaries
and here is your question.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.640

reduced their range to the

area of what mountain range that includes

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:12.320
answer is Rocky Mountains.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.310
thousands of revelers to
public spaces throughout

00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:00.840
New Orleans including Bourbon
Street and Jackson Square.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:04.570
In what district that
is the city's oldest?

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:07.720
- French Quarter.
- French Quarter is correct.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:12.043
Vishal, formed by the
eruption of Mount Mazama

00:11:12.043 --> 00:11:15.740
7,000 years ago, this
lake in Oregon was held

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.920
sacred by the local
Klamouth people and is the

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:22.460
main feature of a national
park, name this lake.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:25.523
- Crater Lake.
- Crater Lake is correct.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.810
Jonathan, Mission Concepcion built in 1755

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:34.730
was one of several Spanish
missions established to

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:37.020
protect borders from French encroachment

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:40.080
and to convert Native
Americans to Catholicism.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.900
These missions are near
what river that shares

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.310
its name with a large Texas City?

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:49.023
- The San Antonio River.
- That is correct.

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:54.840
Sean, Native Americans
in North Central Wyoming

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:58.700
have long used this stone
medicine wheel for ceremonies

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:00.980
and to predict astronomical events.

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:03.850
This sacred site is a
national landmark in what

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:07.910
mountain range that is the
source of the Powder River?

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:10.240
- The Apsoroca Range.
- I'm sorry.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.883
We were looking for Big Horn Mountains.

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:18.030
Three rounds down, four more to go before

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:21.820
we say goodbye to the students
with the four lowest scores.

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.410
But with eight points up for grabs,

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:26.680
it's still anyone's game,
now before we dive back

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.260
into competition, let's get
to know a little bit more

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.363
about our 10 fine finalists.

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:37.180
Nihar, let's begin with you.

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:42.180
You are also the winner of the 2016 Strips

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:45.593
National Spelling Bee,
that is very impressive.

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:49.593
Can you spell my first name?

00:12:50.545 --> 00:12:51.400
(laughing)

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:54.880
In French?
- M-O.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:01.550
- I'm sorry, it's M-E-A-U.
(laughing)

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:03.400
We'll settle it later with the score.

00:13:05.914 --> 00:13:09.510
Venkat Ranjan, you are from
San Ramone, California.

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:12.310
Give me a fun fact about San Ramone

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:13.790
like maybe a point of interest.

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:15.340
What's the best thing about it?

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:19.920
- The headquarters of
the oil company Chevron.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.581
That's all we have.
(laughing)

00:13:22.581 --> 00:13:24.581
- Little company that you
plan on taking over maybe

00:13:24.581 --> 00:13:29.387
once you leave here and it's
a great place to live, right?

00:13:29.387 --> 00:13:32.480
- Yeah.
- Okay.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.680
He's gonna work for the
Chamber of Commerce.

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:37.580
(laughing)

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:41.440
Gayatri, it says here that
you went snorkeling in Hawaii

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:46.020
and had a family of dolphins
swim right next to the boat.

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.920
How could you tell they were a family?

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:53.885
- Well, that's what the
tour guide said, so.

00:13:53.885 --> 00:13:54.885
(laughing)

00:13:54.885 --> 00:13:56.410
- I'm sorry, what's that?
- That's what the tour guide

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:57.243
said.
- I know.

00:13:57.243 --> 00:13:59.360
But they could've been
friends just hanging out.

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:02.770
Was it exciting, was it exciting?

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:05.140
- Yeah.
(laughing)

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:06.273
- Alright excellent.

00:14:08.671 --> 00:14:13.671
Saket, you are from Ohio
and you won the Ohio State

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:17.650
Geo Bee three years in a row,

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:19.540
were all the questions about Ohio?

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:22.190
- No.
(laughing)

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:25.263
- Oh okay, right, well do
you know that old sound.

00:14:26.386 --> 00:14:31.386
♪ Round on the end and
high in the middle, Ohio ♪

00:14:31.601 --> 00:14:33.851
(laughing)

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:40.660
You have to be 49 or older to get that.

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:45.660
Oops, I gave it away,
Anoushka, it says here

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:48.080
this is really cool, that
you enjoy reading fiction

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.143
and plan on writing a
book about an explorer.

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:54.063
Which explorer are you interested in?

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:59.080
- I think everything the
Renaissance and all the

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.050
explorers coming to the new world.

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:03.301
That's something that's
really interested me.

00:15:03.301 --> 00:15:05.651
So I think that's an
interesting story concept.

00:15:06.621 --> 00:15:08.701
- Okay, interesting, alright.

00:15:08.701 --> 00:15:11.210
And you've played the violin for how long?

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:13.650
- Six or seven years.
- Six or seven years.

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:16.640
And how was it balancing studying for this

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:20.350
and playing the violin or did
one help the other in a way?

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:22.380
- It's a really good break a lot of time.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.300
If I'm studying and I'm
just not remembering stuff.

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:28.470
Then it's something I'll just
go and do, play for an hour

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:30.610
and then I'll be able to retain

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:32.160
much more information that way.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.760
- Right, I love that she blows
off steam by studying the

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:38.240
violin, I'm like, how low do I feel?

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:42.540
That's very impressive,
just gonna mess around.

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:44.971
Get off that violin, come
on, you're wasting time.

00:15:44.971 --> 00:15:46.330
(laughing)

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:49.070
Alright, Atreya, you are
the youngest one here.

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:52.250
How does that feel, you're in fifth grade.

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:54.793
- It feels good to be the youngest one.

00:15:57.102 --> 00:15:59.984
Like I have nothing to lose.
(laughing)

00:15:59.984 --> 00:16:02.234
(applause)

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.440
- You got time, you're gonna survive

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.870
all of these people here.

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:11.860
You got years ahead of you, right?

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.343
But that's a good point,
you can just, right,

00:16:14.343 --> 00:16:17.425
really just have fun because
you've got years to go

00:16:17.425 --> 00:16:20.510
with this eligibility.
- Yeah.

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:23.440
- And you really are just
11, this is not a rouse.

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.273
- Yeah, I'm 11.
- Okay.

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:30.380
Alright Ashwin, this
is the second time I've

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:34.180
moderated with you up here,
you were here two years ago.

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:36.230
What happened last year, no, I'm kidding.

00:16:37.086 --> 00:16:37.919
(laughing)

00:16:37.919 --> 00:16:40.790
No it's very very impressive
that you're here twice.

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:45.790
Now you were just recently
traveling through Costa Rica.

00:16:47.463 --> 00:16:48.980
Tell us about that.
- Well it's really cool

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:52.040
'cause unlike other
countries in Latin America,

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.530
Costa Rica has really
taken a lot of efforts to

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:58.270
preserve it's biodiversity
so we got to travel through

00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:02.250
a lot of really pristine
rainforests and natural

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:04.490
environments that don't
really exist anymore

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:07.270
anywhere else in Latin America

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:08.770
so that was pretty incredible.

00:17:09.866 --> 00:17:11.592
- Well that's wonderful
and there's, I think,

00:17:11.592 --> 00:17:12.425
an election coming up in Costa Rica

00:17:12.425 --> 00:17:13.940
and he should be on the ballet.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:20.368
Vishal, you are from Georgia.

00:17:20.368 --> 00:17:23.153
Georgia has a lot of great crops.

00:17:24.257 --> 00:17:29.257
So I have to ask you the
questions, peanuts or peaches.

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:30.790
- Peaches.
- Peaches.

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:32.663
That is correct for an extra point.

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:37.210
It's a wonderful state
though, a beautiful state.

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:41.080
- Alright, Jonathan, from
North Carolina, Jonathan Song,

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:45.800
you were on a robotics team
that competes in the first

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.880
tech challenge, what is that?

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:52.820
- Well it's like, you make
these like mini robots.

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:55.430
It's not the full size
ones but they compete

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:57.940
on a field and they do missions and stuff.

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:01.339
- When you eventually
create your own robot,

00:18:01.339 --> 00:18:03.299
what is your priority,
what is the one thing you

00:18:03.299 --> 00:18:07.980
want your robot to be able to
do if it could do anything?

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:10.823
- Cook for me.
(laughing)

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:16.118
- And I'm guessing Jonathan's
parents feel the same way.

00:18:16.118 --> 00:18:18.040
(laughing)

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:22.020
Alright Sean Chang from New Hampshire.

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:25.360
Your hobbies include speed
cubing and at first when

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:26.910
I read it I thought it was speed clubbing

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:29.130
and I thought you're a
little young for that.

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:30.400
What is speed cubing?

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:34.290
- It's just solving Rubix
Cubes as fast as you can.

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:36.975
- [Mo] Is it specifically Rubix cubes?

00:18:36.975 --> 00:18:40.130
- There's different size ones
like the traditional ones,

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:42.510
like a three by three but
there's different sizes.

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:46.010
- And how fast can you do
an old fashioned Rubix cube?

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:50.600
- My best competition
time is 9.29 seconds.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.880
- 9.2 seconds?
- Yeah.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:56.450
- Oh my gosh, that's, wow.

00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:59.000
That's how long it takes
me to make the first turn.

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:03.850
Oh and I read, do you know what the state

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:07.773
fruit of New Hampshire is?
- No.

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:13.140
- Alright well it's in the
final round, no, I'm kidding.

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:14.931
It's a pumpkin, I thought
that that was kinda cute

00:19:14.931 --> 00:19:19.931
and confusing because I
thought a pumpkin was just a

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:24.900
decoration or maybe a
vegetable, alright and let's

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:29.370
give a shout out to
our other 44 finalists.

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:32.913
These brilliant students.
(applause)

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:45.001
And now back to our competition.

00:19:45.001 --> 00:19:46.870
For round four, you'll
need your stylus again

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:50.090
because everyone answers this
question at the same time.

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:52.170
This question is worth one point.

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:55.060
The National Geographic
Society is committed to

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.900
exploring and protecting
our planet and supporting

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:00.470
bold individuals who are
pushing the boundaries of

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:04.360
knowledge, take a look at your monitors.

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:08.170
Daniella Kavachi is a biologist
and National Geographic

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:11.470
young explorer, as a
child in Mexico, she was

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:14.620
attracted to strange and
misunderstood animals

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:18.220
like spiders and snakes,
today she is fortunate to work

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:22.290
with one of the most
mysterious creatures, bats.

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:25.330
Daniella's current project
is to identify and preserve

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:28.030
bat species in archeological zones.

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:31.080
So at night, she spends
time inside pyramids

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.163
looking for these beautiful animals.

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:37.560
And here is your question,
some female lesser long nosed

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.420
bats migrate to the
United States to roost in

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:43.390
a National monument that borders Mexico.

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:46.440
These bats are the primary
pollinators of a species of

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:49.800
cactus that gave it's
name to the monument.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.473
What is the name of this cactus?

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:57.491
You will have 12 seconds
to write down your answer.

00:20:57.491 --> 00:21:00.158
(intense music)

00:21:06.139 --> 00:21:06.972
(bell dings)

00:21:06.972 --> 00:21:09.690
Time's up, let's see what everyone wrote.

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:14.690
For one point the correct
answer is Organ Pipe.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:20.240
Okay so let's see how everyone did.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:23.073
Three of you had the correct answer.

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.493
That was a nail biter there.

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:30.640
We've come to the first Geo
Challenge of the competition.

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.310
We'll be testing you not
just on what you know

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:36.040
but how well you know
it, each of you will be

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:38.930
presented with a different
map of the continuous

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:43.190
United States and two choices
for what the map is showing.

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:45.730
You will have 10 seconds
to tell us your answer.

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:48.608
If you are correct, you will
receive one point and the

00:21:48.608 --> 00:21:53.260
opportunity to explain why
for a possible two additional

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:55.582
points, we will give you a
few moments to think about

00:21:55.582 --> 00:21:57.910
your response and when
the bell rings, you'll

00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:01.290
have 20 seconds in which to
complete your explanation.

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:03.891
A panel of judges will
determine if your explanation is

00:22:03.891 --> 00:22:07.190
strong enough to earn the
additional two points.

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:10.010
When it's your turn, take
a look at your monitor.

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:14.560
Ready, Nihar, take a look at your map.

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:19.560
Does this map show vegetation
zones or average wind speeds?

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:24.520
- This map is showing vegetation zones.

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:28.660
- [Mo] I'm sorry, the correct
answer is average wind speeds

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:31.360
so unfortunately you don't get any points.

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:34.290
Venkat, take a look at your map.

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:39.133
Does this map show irrigated
land or peach production?

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.430
- This map shows irrigated land.

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:45.370
- That is correct for one point, for two

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:49.370
additional points tell us
why this answer is correct.

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:52.730
- This map is showing
irrigated land because

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:55.520
areas that do not naturally
receive a lot of water

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:58.720
that support farming are
shown in the map like the

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.840
Central Valley of California
and the Snake River Valley

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:05.280
of Idaho, this map cannot
be a peach production map

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.220
because most peaches
are grown in the south

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:09.630
especially in Georgia.
- Alright.

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:12.030
And we're gonna give the
judges a moment to confer.

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:14.340
And the judges are quite
satisfied with your answer

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:16.363
so two additional points for you.

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:20.910
Gayatri, take a look at your map.

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:24.840
Does this map show percent of federal land

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:27.193
or miles driven per capita?

00:23:31.306 --> 00:23:33.060
- This map shows miles driven per capita.

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:36.270
- That is correct for one
point, for two additional

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:39.410
points tell us why this answer is correct.

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:43.190
- Had this map shown
percent of federal land,

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:46.750
places like Arizona and
New Mexico with lots of

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:50.300
land owned federally by
the government would've had

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:54.550
a higher shading, this map
shows miles driven per capita

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:58.451
because open places like
Wyoming and Montana have.

00:23:58.451 --> 00:24:00.411
(bell dings)

00:24:00.411 --> 00:24:01.580
- We'll give the judges
a moment to confer.

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:04.130
And you just got those
two additional points

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:05.980
for your answer for your explanation.

00:24:07.348 --> 00:24:12.348
Saket, does your map
show average minimum wage

00:24:12.962 --> 00:24:17.910
or ferry boat boardings by state?

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:20.350
- This map shows average minimum wage.

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:22.350
- [Mo] I'm sorry that is incorrect.

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:25.943
The correct answer is ferry
boat boardings by state.

00:24:27.732 --> 00:24:31.697
So no points for you,
Anoushka, does your map show

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:37.710
pesticide use or number of dairy cows?

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:39.413
- This map shows pesticide use.

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:43.172
- Pesticide use is correct,
you earned one point.

00:24:43.172 --> 00:24:44.614
For two additional points, tell us

00:24:44.614 --> 00:24:46.120
why this answer is correct.

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.630
- This map shows pesticide
use because the highest

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:50.980
concentrations are in
great plains and along the

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:53.900
Mississippi River where a
lot of pesticides are used

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:57.150
in farming, if this map was
showing number of dairy cows,

00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:58.770
there would be a much
higher concentration in

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:01.410
Wisconsin and Texas.
- We'll give the

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:02.793
judges a moment to confer.

00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:06.380
And Anoushka, they like your answer.

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:07.880
Two additional points for you.

00:25:10.312 --> 00:25:12.530
- Atreya, take a look at your map.

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:17.530
Tell us, does it show percent
homeless or literacy rate?

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:22.090
- Literacy rate.
- I'm sorry Atreya.

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:25.160
The correct answer is percent homeless.

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:30.160
Ashwin, does your map show
the range of the black bear

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:33.090
or the range of the Ponderosa Pine?

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:36.130
- Range of the Ponderosa Pine.
- That is correct.

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:38.560
And for one point, for
two additional points,

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:40.430
tell us why this answer is correct.

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:42.660
- This map shows range
of the Ponderosa Pine

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:45.700
'cause all of the coloring is
in the Western United States

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:47.740
where the range of the Ponderosa Pine is

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:50.100
in the interior west, it
doesn't show black bears

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:51.620
because black bears are also found in the

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:54.800
eastern United States.
- Judges, what say you?

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.090
The judges like that answer,
two additional points for

00:25:57.090 --> 00:26:02.090
Ashwin, Vishal, does your
map show number of days

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:07.843
with freezing temperatures
or average annual snowfall?

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:12.220
- Average annual snowfall?
- It is average annual

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:15.313
snowfall for one point,
for two additional points,

00:26:16.386 --> 00:26:18.180
tell us why your answer is correct.

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:20.330
- This map shows average
annual snowfall because

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:24.320
areas such as the Colorado
Rockies and the Sierra Nevada

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:26.590
have a high concentration on this map.

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:29.680
And this map does not
show freezing temperatures

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:33.080
because there would be
a higher concentration

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:35.400
such as north, like western North Carolina

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:37.513
and eastern Tennessee where they would be.

00:26:38.355 --> 00:26:40.395
(bell dings)

00:26:40.395 --> 00:26:42.900
- And the judges approve
of Vishal's explanation

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:44.313
for two additional points.

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.193
Jonathan, take a look at your map.

00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:53.490
Does this map show public
libraries or golf courses?

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:57.560
- Public libraries.
- Public libraries

00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.310
is correct, you earned one point.

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:02.050
For two additional points, tell us why

00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:04.780
this answer is correct.
- This map shows

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:07.790
public libraries because
the higher concentration on

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:10.550
this map is in the cities
where the majority of public

00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:13.680
libraries are located, it
doesn't show golf courses

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.510
because golf courses can
also be found in rural

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:20.013
and suburban areas.
- Judges.

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:22.880
The judges like that answer,

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.810
two additional points to Jonathan.

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:29.630
Sean, does your map
show Superfund hazardous

00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:33.183
waste sites or four year colleges?

00:27:34.822 --> 00:27:36.360
- Four year colleges.
- I'm sorry the correct

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:39.930
answer was Superfund
hazardous waste sites.

00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:44.263
And that concludes the
first Geo Challenge round.

00:27:45.627 --> 00:27:46.790
Five rounds down and two more to go

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:49.360
before our first four eliminations.

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:51.270
There are four points up for grabs over

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:54.380
the next two rounds, you'll
need your stylus again

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:57.730
in round six, we'll be hearing
from a National Geographic

00:27:57.730 --> 00:28:01.350
explorer, take a look at your monitors.

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:04.100
- Hi, I'm Courtney Borgerson,
I am an anthropologist,

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:07.200
a conservation biologist and a
National Geographic explorer.

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.470
You'll often find me in
Madagascar where I study

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:11.720
eco system balance and
the illegal hunting of

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:14.760
endangered lemurs but I'm also
passionate about education

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:17.105
and I visit classrooms in the
US to teach students about

00:28:17.105 --> 00:28:20.020
scientific inquiry right
in their own backyards.

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:22.870
Now here's your question,
one of my first experiences

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:25.940
with science was a school
field trip to a US island

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:28.710
that is home to the world's
longest running predator

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:32.260
prey study, this lake island
is now overpopulated with

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:34.950
moose and scientists want
to bring the island back

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:38.160
into ecological balance by
repopulating it with wolves.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:41.733
Name this lake island which
is also a national park.

00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:45.560
- You'll have 12 seconds
to write down your answer.

00:28:55.591 --> 00:28:56.671
(bell dings)

00:28:56.671 --> 00:28:58.150
Time's up, let's see what everyone wrote.

00:28:58.150 --> 00:29:01.250
For one point, the correct
answer is, all together now

00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:04.233
Isle Royale.
(applause)

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:08.070
Now let's take a moment
to review the scores

00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:12.580
before our next round, Ashwin is in front

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:16.884
and there is a five way
tie, Venkat, Gayatri,

00:29:16.884 --> 00:29:20.890
Anoushka, Vishal and
Jonathan right behind there.

00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:23.380
Okay after this round,
the four students with the

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:26.490
lowest scores will leave us
but there are still three

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:28.760
points up for grabs for each student.

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:33.730
In round seven, the aptly
named lightning round.

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:38.110
Here's how it works, I'll
give you each, I'll give

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:40.500
each of you three questions
in a row and you'll

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.510
have six seconds to answer each.

00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:45.360
One point is awarded for
each correct response.

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:48.764
Get ready, this one moves like.

00:29:48.764 --> 00:29:50.524
- Lightning.
- Like lightning.

00:29:50.524 --> 00:29:53.780
- Like lightning, I'll
work on my delivery, okay.

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:58.610
Here we go, Nihar, what
is the name of the largest

00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:02.420
swamp on the border of
Virginia and North Carolina?

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:05.280
- The Great Dismal Swamp.
- That is correct.

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:08.960
And again Nihar, Wayamaya
Canyon is located

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:12.460
on which Hawaiian island?
- Kawaii.

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:14.880
- [Mo] That is correct, name

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.193
the state reptile of Mississippi.

00:30:23.348 --> 00:30:25.515

is correct, settlers in Oklahoma
who started the land rush

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:56.893
early inspired what
nickname for the state.

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:00.103
- The sooner state.
- That is correct.

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:04.660
Gayatri, what large city
in eastern Tennessee

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:07.490
was the state's first capital?

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:08.900
- Memphis.
- I'm sorry.

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:12.710
The answer is Knoxville, again Gayatri.

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:15.110
Providence, Rhode Island is located at the

00:31:16.165 --> 00:31:18.120

Geographic Bee, our three
finalists are sequestered

00:52:21.050 --> 00:52:23.910
back stage where they can
neither see nor hear anything

00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:27.980
happening on stage, in this
next Geo Challenge round

00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:30.810
we'll bring them out one
by one to test 'em not just

00:52:30.810 --> 00:52:33.480
on what they know but
how well they can apply

00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:35.890
and communicate that knowledge.

00:52:35.890 --> 00:52:39.070
Each student will answer
the same question which

00:52:39.070 --> 00:52:42.180
poses a real world scenario
and they'll be given

00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:44.870
three possible answers
from which to choose.

00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:48.040
Our panel of judges of will
score their responses based

00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:53.040
on three criteria, accuracy,
reasoning and presentation.

00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:56.850
Each year millions of tons
of plastic waste end up in

00:52:56.850 --> 00:52:59.344
the oceans threatening everything
that depends on earth's

00:52:59.344 --> 00:53:03.850
largest eco system, National
Geographic has begun a multi

00:53:03.850 --> 00:53:07.040
year effort to raise awareness
and help find solutions to

00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:10.623
this crisis, our three
finalists will be asked to

00:53:10.623 --> 00:53:14.450
identify a location for
an ongoing clean up effort

00:53:14.450 --> 00:53:17.080
to recover plastics from a local river.

00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:19.710
The goal is to reduce the
amount of plastic that leeches

00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:22.182
the ocean, the students much tell us which

00:53:22.182 --> 00:53:26.013
river is the best location and why.

00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:29.960
The students must focus
their effort at the Mouth of

00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:33.660
one of three rivers, the
Niger river, the Rhine

00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:37.410
river or the Yangtze River,
they must factor in the

00:53:37.410 --> 00:53:40.290
area's population, plastic consumption

00:53:40.290 --> 00:53:43.140
and plastic waste management.

00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:46.140
The Yangtze river is the
best choice because of the

00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:49.290
high population and high
plastic consumption in the

00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:52.734
Yangtze river basin, it's
also a rapidly growing area

00:53:52.734 --> 00:53:56.090
with overwhelmed waste management.

00:53:56.090 --> 00:53:59.560
The Niger river would be
the second best choice.

00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:02.890
The region has less population
and plastic consumption

00:54:02.890 --> 00:54:06.023
than that of the Yangtze though it's waste

00:54:06.023 --> 00:54:08.000
management is also strained.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.980
The Rhine river is the weakest
choice for the clean up

00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:14.029
effort, it has the lowest
population and while it has

00:54:14.029 --> 00:54:16.765
high per capita plastic consumption,

00:54:16.765 --> 00:54:20.403
it has the strongest
existing waste management.

00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:25.620
The students must choice the
answer that best fits the

00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:27.590
scenario and explain their reasoning.

00:54:27.590 --> 00:54:29.720
We will give each of them
a moment to think about it.

00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:33.610
But once the bell rings, they'll
have 45 seconds to respond.

00:54:33.610 --> 00:54:36.480
If he or she falls silent
for more than five seconds,

00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:38.300
their time will be up.

00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:41.340
This question is worth
a whopping nine points.

00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:44.970
So this is a game making
or game breaking moment

00:54:44.970 --> 00:54:48.040
for our finalists, the students
have been briefed on these

00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:50.190
rules but obviously not the question.

00:54:50.190 --> 00:54:53.020
And remember this is not
just about right or wrong.

00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:58.020
This is also about reasoning,
the quality of presentation.

00:54:58.030 --> 00:55:02.187
We begin with the student
currently in third place.

00:55:02.187 --> 00:55:04.900
Vishal, please come on out
on stage to be the first

00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:07.433
to answer this Geo Challenge.

00:55:09.069 --> 00:55:11.319
(applause)

00:55:15.997 --> 00:55:18.927
I'm gonna ask you to take
right front and center.

00:55:18.927 --> 00:55:21.110
Vishal, here is the question.

00:55:21.110 --> 00:55:24.000
Each year millions of tons of plastic

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.570
debris ends up in the oceans,
much of it from rivers.

00:55:27.570 --> 00:55:29.840
Your goal is to help reduce the amount

00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:32.890
of plastic that reaches
the oceans by organizing

00:55:32.890 --> 00:55:36.760
a clean up effort to remove
plastic from a major river.

00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:38.780
You can focus your
clean up effort near the

00:55:38.780 --> 00:55:42.720
mouth of one of three
rivers, the Niger river,

00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:46.300
the Rhine river or the Yangzke river based

00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:49.120
on the criteria of population, plastic

00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:52.060
consumption and plastic waste management,

00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:54.140
on which river would your clean up

00:55:54.140 --> 00:55:56.160
effort have the greatest impact?

00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:57.750
You will have 15 seconds to think

00:55:57.750 --> 00:56:01.813
about your answer. When the
bell rings, please begin.

00:56:14.563 --> 00:56:15.396
(bell dings)

00:56:15.396 --> 00:56:18.530
- I would focus my clean up
effort on the Yangzke River

00:56:18.530 --> 00:56:21.160
because first of all, the
Yangzke river has a really

00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:24.703
great population with cities
such as Shanghi and Nanging.

00:56:25.659 --> 00:56:27.700
Second of all, there's a lot
of plastic consumption with

00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:31.250
China having one of the most
plastic consuming countries in

00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:34.240
the world and China doesn't
have the best plastic waste

00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:37.900
management so a clean up would really help

00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:40.910
to clean up the plastic
on the Yangzke river.

00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:44.120
The Niger river on the other
hand, does not have as much

00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:48.035
plastic consumption as the
Yangzke and the Rhine River

00:56:48.035 --> 00:56:50.680
is really good with
plastic waste management

00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:54.740
and doesn't consume average
plastic as the Yangzke river.

00:56:54.740 --> 00:56:56.930
For these reasons I would
choose the Yangzke river

00:56:56.930 --> 00:57:00.610
for my clean up efforts.
- A round of applause for

00:57:00.610 --> 00:57:03.918
Vishal, nice done, so come
back here if you would.

00:57:03.918 --> 00:57:04.918
(applause)

00:57:04.918 --> 00:57:07.023
And I'm gonna ask you to stand
like right in here, okay.

00:57:08.310 --> 00:57:12.013
Alright, now let's bring
out Anoushka, okay.

00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:15.633
Anoushka, come on out.
(applause)

00:57:18.220 --> 00:57:20.963
I'm gonna ask you to stand
front and center there.

00:57:21.857 --> 00:57:23.700
Anoushka here is the question.

00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:27.570
Each year millions of tons
of plastic debris ends

00:57:27.570 --> 00:57:30.360
up in the oceans, much of it from rivers.

00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:32.610
Your goal is to help reduce the amount of

00:57:32.610 --> 00:57:35.850
plastic that reaches
the oceans by organizing

00:57:35.850 --> 00:57:39.520
a clean up effort to remove
plastic from a major river.

00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:41.950
You can focus your clean
up effort near the mouth

00:57:41.950 --> 00:57:46.310
of one of three rivers, the
Niger river, the Rhine river

00:57:46.310 --> 00:57:50.210
or the Yangzke river based on
the criteria of population,

00:57:50.210 --> 00:57:53.240
plastic consumption and
plastic waste management,

00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:55.180
on which river would your clean up

00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:57.450
effort have the greatest impact?

00:57:57.450 --> 00:58:00.180
You will have 15 seconds
to think about your answer.

00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:02.503
When the bell rings, please begin.

00:58:13.852 --> 00:58:14.685
(bell dings)

00:58:14.685 --> 00:58:16.720
- I would choose the Yangzke
river to focus a clean up

00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:20.939
effort on, the Yangzke river
flows, the mouth of the Yangzke

00:58:20.939 --> 00:58:23.139
river is at Shanghi which
is a major city in China.

00:58:23.139 --> 00:58:26.300
Between the many people in
the city, there is a lot of

00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:29.680
plastic waste that occurs
and China is often considered

00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:32.770
one of the most populated,
populated and polluted places

00:58:32.770 --> 00:58:36.120
in the world, on the other
hand, the Rhine river mouth

00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:39.780
is in the Netherlands where
there is a stable clean up

00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:43.130
system already in place and
a much smaller population.

00:58:43.130 --> 00:58:46.710
Along the Niger river there
is also less plastic waste

00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:49.560
being used, for these reasons
I would choose the Yangzke

00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:51.910
river to focus a clean
up effort on, thank you.

00:58:53.094 --> 00:58:55.055
(applause)

00:58:55.055 --> 00:58:57.260
- Anoushka, I'm gonna ask
you to come back here please

00:58:57.260 --> 00:59:00.263
and stand to the left of Venkat, perfect.

00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:06.520
Alright, and now let's bring out Venkat.

00:59:08.115 --> 00:59:10.365
(applause)

00:59:14.005 --> 00:59:17.500
Venkat, if you wanna stand
right front and center there.

00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:19.100
Here's the question.

00:59:19.100 --> 00:59:22.950
Each year millions of tons
of plastic debris ends

00:59:22.950 --> 00:59:26.070
up in the oceans, much of it from rivers.

00:59:26.070 --> 00:59:28.700
Your goal is to help reduce
the amount of plastic

00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:31.640
that reaches the oceans
by organizing a clean up

00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:34.580
effort to remove plastic
from a major river.

00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:36.780
You can focus your clean
up effort near the mouth

00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:40.890
of one of three rivers, the
Niger river, the Rhine river

00:59:40.890 --> 00:59:44.640
or the Yangzke river based on
the criteria of population,

00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:47.820
plastic consumption and
plastic waste management,

00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:48.890
on which river would your

00:59:48.890 --> 00:59:52.180
clean up effort have the greatest impact?

00:59:52.180 --> 00:59:54.960
You will have 15 seconds
to think about your answer.

00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:57.343
When the bell rings, please begin.

01:00:08.557 --> 01:00:09.690
(bell dings)

01:00:09.690 --> 01:00:12.370
- I believe that the Yangzke
river is the best river

01:00:12.370 --> 01:00:15.750
to focus my plastic clean up effort on.

01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:18.580
This is because tens of
millions of people live on

01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:20.945
the Yangzke river today and
they produce a lot of plastic

01:00:20.945 --> 01:00:25.945
as the Yangzke river in China
has a huge manufacturing

01:00:26.844 --> 01:00:29.253
industry that produces
a lot of plastic waste.

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:34.040
Also the China does not
have a very good waste

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:37.870
management program, unlike
the Rhine River in Europe

01:00:37.870 --> 01:00:41.480
and the Rhine River is
not a good choice because

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:43.080
even though it produces a lot of plastic,

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:46.320
as I said before, it has good
plastic waste management.

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:48.630
The Niger river is not a
good choice because not too

01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:50.790
many people live along
it's banks and it has

01:00:50.790 --> 01:00:54.375
very low plastic consumption, that is why.

01:00:54.375 --> 01:00:56.578
(bell dings)
(applause)

01:00:56.578 --> 01:00:59.150
Okay, I'm gonna ask the two
of you to come with me please.

01:00:59.150 --> 01:01:00.980
If you would Venkat, stand to the left

01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:04.280
and Vishal all the way on the
right and Anoushka in between,

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:06.020
the order in which you came out.

01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:09.306
Great job by all of our finalists.

01:01:09.306 --> 01:01:11.556
(applause)

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:17.403
Now our judges will take
a few moments to confer.

01:01:17.403 --> 01:01:20.070
(intense music)

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:53.720
The judges have tabulated the
scores for this Geo Challenge

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:56.443
and are ready to share the results.

01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:59.240
Judges, we'll start with Vishal.

01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:04.320
- Hi Vishal, you responded
with the Yangzke River

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:08.570
which was the best choice, you
gave great supporting facts

01:02:08.570 --> 01:02:11.500
for all the criteria we
were looking for including

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:14.850
mentioning Shaghi and
Naching, your excellent

01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:18.400
presentation was also very
well organized and had an

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:20.460
excellent progression as well.

01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:22.583
We gave you eight points.

01:02:23.897 --> 01:02:27.247
- And that gives Vishal
a total now of 30 points.

01:02:27.247 --> 01:02:29.243
And we move on to Anoushka now.

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:32.620
- Anoushka, you also
mentioned the Yangzke river

01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:34.530
which is what we were looking for.

01:02:34.530 --> 01:02:37.044
You had good facts to
support all of the criteria

01:02:37.044 --> 01:02:41.430
and contrasted the weaker
choices against the best answer.

01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:45.050
Your presentation was
very very clear but it did

01:02:45.050 --> 01:02:49.023
feel a little rushed, we
gave you seven points.

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:54.000
- And that gives Anoushka
a total of 33 points.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.793
And finally Venkat.
- Venkat,

01:02:57.053 --> 01:03:00.161
you also mentioned the Yangzke river.

01:03:00.161 --> 01:03:03.644
You had excellent details
and a more complete

01:03:03.644 --> 01:03:07.260
explanation to support your
choice including mentioning

01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:10.140
the industrial base of the Yangzke basin.

01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:12.833
Your presentation was
effective but overall

01:03:12.833 --> 01:03:17.410
could've been smoother,
we gave you eight points.

01:03:17.410 --> 01:03:21.460
- That gives Venkat a total of 34.

01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:24.713
Tremendous job by all,
that was a real nail biter.

01:03:25.607 --> 01:03:27.857
(applause)

01:03:29.470 --> 01:03:34.230
And after tabulating the
scores, we must say goodbye

01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:38.090
to Vishal but don't forget
you're still leaving here a

01:03:38.090 --> 01:03:42.626
winner, there's a $10,000
scholarship with your name on it.

01:03:42.626 --> 01:03:43.550
(applause)

01:03:43.550 --> 01:03:46.952
A big congratulations to
you for making it this far.

01:03:46.952 --> 01:03:49.202
(applause)

01:03:51.390 --> 01:03:56.390
And then there were two, Anoushka
Buddhikot from New Jersey

01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:59.729
and Venkat Ranjan from California.

01:03:59.729 --> 01:04:02.660
(applause and cheering)

01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:05.110
We are gonna get set
up for the final round

01:04:05.110 --> 01:04:07.990
and when we return, one
of these gifted students

01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:12.665
will become the 2018 National
Geographic Bee Champion.

01:04:12.665 --> 01:04:14.915
(applause)

01:04:15.860 --> 01:04:18.050
- [Narrator] There is a lot on
the line for these students.

01:04:18.050 --> 01:04:21.560
The Champion will receive a
$50,000 scholarship plus a

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:24.700
lifetime membership to the
National Geographic Society

01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:27.520
and a Lindblad Expedition
to the Galapagos Islands

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:30.470
aboard the National
Geographic Endeavor Two.

01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:32.573
Now back to Mo Rocca.

01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:38.090
- Welcome to the Championship
Round of the 30th

01:04:38.090 --> 01:04:42.700
National Geographic Bee,
out of 2.6 million students,

01:04:43.590 --> 01:04:47.100
54 of the country's brightest
young geographers made it

01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:51.230
here to Washington DC, the
top 10 earned their place

01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:55.130
to compete today, now we're down to two.

01:04:55.130 --> 01:04:58.980
13 year old Venkat Ranjan from California

01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:02.890
and 13 year old Anoushka
Buddhikot from New Jersey.

01:05:02.890 --> 01:05:05.909
Congratulations on to you
both on making it this far.

01:05:05.909 --> 01:05:08.159
(applause)

01:05:13.970 --> 01:05:17.483
So Venkat, what would it mean
to you to win this thing?

01:05:18.931 --> 01:05:21.452
- That would be good.
(laughing)

01:05:21.452 --> 01:05:24.433
- Be good, you're underplaying
it right now, right?

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:29.250
- Maybe.
- I get it, okay.

01:05:29.250 --> 01:05:33.640
- Anoushka, how long have
you prepared for this moment?

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:35.930
- I've been participating
in the National Geographic

01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:37.580
Bees since I was in fourth grade.

01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:40.090
- Since the fourth
grade, nine or 10 years,

01:05:40.090 --> 01:05:42.210
eight or nine years old, right?

01:05:42.210 --> 01:05:46.210
Excellent, okay, well you've
come a long way, both of you.

01:05:46.210 --> 01:05:48.100
And now it's time to get down to business.

01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:49.820
Here's how it's going to work.

01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:53.250
You each begin this final
round with a clean slate.

01:05:53.250 --> 01:05:56.420
The Championship round
is single elimination.

01:05:56.420 --> 01:06:00.440
You will both be asked the
same question at the same time.

01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:02.760
The contestant who correctly
answers the question

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:05.340
that the other contestant
misses will be named

01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:09.280
our National Champion,
so watch closely because

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:13.300
every question could be
the winning question.

01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:16.510
You're gonna need your
stylus for this final round.

01:06:16.510 --> 01:06:19.350
I will read each question
twice so listen carefully

01:06:19.350 --> 01:06:21.820
before answering, you'll
then have 12 seconds to

01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:24.570
write your responses, for the final time,

01:06:24.570 --> 01:06:27.033
students, are you ready?

01:06:30.310 --> 01:06:33.333
They're ready, here is your question.

01:06:36.670 --> 01:06:40.750
Name the small southeast
Asian country that has a

01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:45.730
northern coastline on the
Wetar and Ombai Straits.

01:06:45.730 --> 01:06:49.920
I repeat Name the small
southeast Asian country that

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:54.893
has a northern coastline on
the Wetar and Ombai Straits.

01:07:06.537 --> 01:07:08.840
(intense music)
(bell dings)

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:11.107
Venkat, what do you have?
- East Timor.

01:07:11.107 --> 01:07:13.253
- Anoushka.
- Timor Leste.

01:07:15.730 --> 01:07:20.140
The correct answer is Timor
Leste, also east Timor.

01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:23.493
So you are both correct.
(applause)

01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:31.300
And we like variety, okay,
onto the next question.

01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:34.500
Lebanon has a population most

01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:38.600
similar to which South American country?

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:41.820
I repeat Lebanon has a population

01:07:41.820 --> 01:07:46.323
most similar to which
South American country?

01:07:58.754 --> 01:08:01.170
(bell dings)

01:08:01.170 --> 01:08:03.013
Venkat, what do you have?
- Paraguay.

01:08:04.298 --> 01:08:05.513
- Anoushka.
- Guyana.

01:08:06.730 --> 01:08:09.860
- Two different answers, I
can tell you now that one

01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:13.143
is correct so we're
about to learn who is the

01:08:13.143 --> 01:08:17.690
2018 National Geographic Bee Champion.

01:08:17.690 --> 01:08:22.690
The correct answer is
Paraguay, so Venkat Ranjan

01:08:24.897 --> 01:08:29.312
is the 2018 National Geographic Bee.

01:08:29.312 --> 01:08:34.229
(intense music)
(applause)

01:08:39.876 --> 01:08:42.876
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

01:08:44.118 --> 01:08:47.451
(applause and cheering)

01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:56.810
- [Narrator] A dramatic end
to a terrific competition.

01:08:56.810 --> 01:08:59.780
Here's how our 10 finalists
officially finished.

01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:02.096
And remember each of these
students outlasted millions of

01:09:02.096 --> 01:09:05.600
others around the country
to make it to Washington DC

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:08.070
and end up on this stage.

01:09:08.070 --> 01:09:12.720

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:15.740

Thank you Mike and I'm
gonna step over here.

01:10:39.035 --> 01:10:44.035
And Venkat, I've gotta ask
you what was going through

01:10:44.245 --> 01:10:47.720
your mind on that last
question about population of

01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:49.584
Lebanon being similar,
most similar to which

01:10:49.584 --> 01:10:53.250
South American country.
- I don't know this

01:10:53.250 --> 01:10:55.100
so I'm gonna have to guess something.

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:58.360
- So you winged it.
- Kinda.

01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:00.820
- Right and we're lucky that
in the midst of those two

01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:03.260
minutes, Paraguay didn't have
a huge baby boom or something

01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:05.071
like that.
(laughing)

01:11:05.071 --> 01:11:07.560
Thrown the whole thing
off, now please join me in

01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:10.810

01:11:10.810 --> 01:11:14.120

01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:24.934
