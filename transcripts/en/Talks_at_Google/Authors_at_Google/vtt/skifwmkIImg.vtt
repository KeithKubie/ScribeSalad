00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:03.250
FEMALE SPEAKER: I would like
to welcome to Google Anna

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:03.810
Quindlen.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.010
Anna Quindlen is a household
name, beloved for her "New York

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.460
Times" best selling books, which
include eight novels and eight

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.061
works of nonfiction.

00:00:12.061 --> 00:00:14.560
She was the third woman to have
a regular column in the "New

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.100
York Times" op-ed page.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.840
And "Public and Private" won the
Pulitzer Prize for commentary

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.790
in 1992.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.417
And for 10 years she wrote
the "Last Word" column

00:00:22.417 --> 00:00:23.000
in "Newsweek."

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.830
Her eighth novel, "Miller's
Valley," was just released.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.140
And we are so honored to
welcome her to Google today.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.280
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.900
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.830
I read that you
don't necessarily

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.920
like to read reviews of your
books, but "Miller's Valley"

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.310
is getting wonderful reviews.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:44.370
So congratulations.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.630
ANNA QUINDLEN: Well thank you.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.550
I actually made it a point,
starting four books ago,

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.390
to not read any reviews,
positive or negative.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.230
It just makes a lot
of noise in your head

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.390
when you sit down to
write the next one.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.680
And I don't need any more
noise than is already up there.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.720
FEMALE SPEAKER: Do you have
anyone else read for you?

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.150
ANNA QUINDLEN: My best
friend vets all the reviews.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.830
She's actually a book
reviewer by profession.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.430
And so mainly she just, oh
this one was really good.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.304
And by the way, we hate
the people at whatever

00:01:18.304 --> 00:01:19.470
the name of the magazine is.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.678
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's sounds
like a good way to do it.

00:01:21.678 --> 00:01:24.410
It's a very soothing
way to do that.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.690
I was wondering if, to begin,
if you might read a paragraph

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.862
from "Miller's Valley."

00:01:29.862 --> 00:01:31.860
ANNA QUINDLEN: Now
you selected this one.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.110
FEMALE SPEAKER: I did.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.060
I selected this one.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.706
I think it will ring very
true to a lot of people.

00:01:37.706 --> 00:01:39.580
ANNA QUINDLEN: It was
a hard time in the fall

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.460
just before I turned 16.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.130
August 2nd had come and gone
and Donald had never arrived.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.900
He sent me a postcard saying
he couldn't get off work,

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.586
but his grandfather had already
told me he wouldn't be coming.

00:01:52.586 --> 00:01:54.760
"It's that mother
of his," he said.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.480
Don't get me started.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.440
He looked so sad.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.470
I knew how he felt. Our
house was built for five.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.360
And now it was down to three.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.110
My brother's old shirts
hung in their closets

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.290
like the ghosts of people
who'd once slept in their beds.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.860
I missed Tommy.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.520
I missed Donald.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.740
I even missed Eddie sometimes
and Donald's grandmother.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.390
Sometimes I thought
about her lavender smell

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.520
and her warm pies.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.700
I think maybe more than anything
I missed the Mimi I used to be.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.670
Getting older wasn't
working out so well for me.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.530
My brother's words
had made me think

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.120
a lot about what I wanted,
where I wanted to end up.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.100
And the truth was I had
no idea in the world.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.760
I figured it should be
clear like that big strip

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.660
of yellow tape they held
across the end of the course

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.880
for the sack race at the
volunteer fire department

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.980
picnic.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.130
This, here, this is how you win.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.940
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.260
I picked that paragraph
because I definitely

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.310
think that myself definitely,
and a lot of people,

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.650
think that it
should be clear, you

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.140
know the path we're supposed
to follow, and then it's not.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.270
And as you can see from
my marks in the book,

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.676
you write a lot of
these human truths.

00:03:19.676 --> 00:03:22.280
I've seen people refer
to it as the thoughts

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.710
that we didn't realize we had.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.140
We have the emotions, but
we don't have the words.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.827
And I was wondering how
you find those words.

00:03:28.827 --> 00:03:31.410
ANNA QUINDLEN: Well that's one
of the great things about being

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.510
a writer.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.430
Writing leads to more writing
leads to more writing.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.100
People ask me all the
time about writer's block.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.960
I was a newspaper
reporter for years.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.979
And you can't have writer's
block in a newspaper newsroom.

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:48.270
You have to write whether
you feel like writing or not.

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.760
So I always sit down, even when
I feel at my least eloquent.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.990
And I think what happens is
bad writing or mediocre writing

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.030
eventually sometimes
leads to good writing.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.170
And good writing
leads to insight

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.760
into yourself and into
the human condition, that

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.560
even come as a shock to you.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.150
I mean, sometimes I'll write
a sentence and rear back

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.660
and look at it and think, my
god, that is what I think.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.990
I mean, that's the thing
that keeps you going,

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:25.170
because doing this is
like pushing a rock uphill

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:26.640
over and over again.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.480
And it's those moments
where suddenly you

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.280
say to yourself, that's it.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.360
I mean, there was a columnist
at the "New York Times," Scotty

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.610
Reston, and he once
said, "How can I

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.170
know what I think until
I read what I write?"

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.320
And I really feel
that way all the time.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.410
FEMALE SPEAKER: I've
heard writing referred

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.996
to as an excavation process
more so than-- or I've heard

00:04:50.996 --> 00:04:52.995
some people refer to it
as an excavation process

00:04:52.995 --> 00:04:55.880
where you sort of have
to chip away at all

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.180
the thoughts and the words.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.574
And then you reach what you're
really trying to get at.

00:04:59.574 --> 00:05:01.490
ANNA QUINDLEN: Well, but
alternatively there's

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.680
a famous quote, and it's
been attributed to everyone

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.360
from the sports writer Red
Smith to Dorothy Parker.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.450
"Writing is simple.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.240
You just sit down at the
typewriter and open a vein."

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.760
And now I would say you
just sit down at the Mac Air

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.620
and open a vein, but you're
always opening a vein.

00:05:23.266 --> 00:05:26.560
FEMALE SPEAKER: Speaking of
"Miller's Valley," so it's

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.207
the story of Mimi Miller
and we sort of grow with her

00:05:30.207 --> 00:05:31.040
throughout the book.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.770
And it's the story
of her and her family

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:39.140
and Miller's Valley,
this rural community.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.830
And there's waters coming in.

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.410
The government is sort
of flooding her valley.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:50.380
And the flood, you know,
when I first read the book,

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:51.830
the flood was just a flood.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.507
But I think that there's
more to it than that.

00:05:54.507 --> 00:05:56.090
And I was wondering
if you could speak

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.600
of the significance of
the flood in the story,

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.140
and then also what it means
to you outside the story.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.490
ANNA QUINDLEN: Well
within the story,

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:11.280
it reflects what happened
all over this country

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.350
at various times in its history.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.970
Not just with water,
but with other entities,

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:18.610
which is that the
government makes

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.440
a decision that the
land on which you live

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.480
might be better used
for the interstate

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.970
or a big industrial complex
or something of the sort,

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:33.420
the law of eminent domain
which we've all heard about.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.910
And in this case, they
think Miller's Valley

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:39.070
would be the perfect
spot for a reservoir.

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:43.190
And the fact that there are
some family farms, which

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:46.890
have been in families for
decades if not centuries,

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:51.440
is not a bar, in their
mind, to progress.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.850
Part of what I wanted
to reflect by that

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.820
is the price we
pay for progress.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:02.860
Frequently progress means
wiping the past clean.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.570
And I don't think that
there is much use to that.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:08.600
I think the past is there to
be learned from, not to paper

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.260
over.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:13.430
But obviously that's what the
government wants to do here.

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:16.180
The other thing in a larger
sense I was trying to reflect

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.370
is that I think
America in some ways

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:22.330
is uniquely a country that
disappears its past over

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:23.060
and over again.

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.290
And it's one of the
reasons why we continually

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.590
make the same
mistakes, because we

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:30.810
seem not to have learned
from what went before,

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:36.700
in part because we don't
remember what went before.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.090
Someone was
interviewing me today

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:41.550
and said that the
writer Gore Vidal once

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:45.000
referred to our country as
the United States of Amnesia.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.040
And I think there's
some truth to that.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.833
And I wanted to reflect
that in the book.

00:07:49.833 --> 00:07:56.246
FEMALE SPEAKER: And the flood in
the book, it's a slow process.

00:07:56.246 --> 00:07:58.527
There comes a point
where Mimi realizes

00:07:58.527 --> 00:08:01.110
what's happening when it sort
of passes the line of no return.

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:02.870
Do you think that
there's also something

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:06.390
there that these slow
processes that don't really

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:08.870
mean too much until we
realize that we can't go back?

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:10.040
ANNA QUINDLEN: Yeah.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.460
I mean, I think if we're
going to lose our homes,

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.230
we lose them by inches.

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:17.690
And we lose them by inches
whether they're underwater

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:20.160
or they still sit there or not.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:24.520
I mean, one of the things that I
think is reflected in this book

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:28.040
is the place where
Mimi grew up, the place

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.680
where she did all of the
learning that turned her

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.150
into who she is
as an older woman,

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:36.530
is now utterly disappeared.

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:41.330
You know, it's under 40 feet of
water by the end of the book.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.330
But the truth is the
places where we all

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:49.080
grew up, for most of us, they
cease to exist a while ago.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.900
I mean, even if
we're quite young,

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:55.260
the Walmart has
replaced the cornfield.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:09:00.150
And the tattoo parlor has
replaced the card store

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:01.300
on Main Street.

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:04.510
And things morph and change.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:07.660
Conversely, the place
where we all grew up

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:11.750
is vividly, completely,
utterly alive.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:15.090
It's just completely
alive inside of us.

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:19.350
I mean, I haven't been back
to the house where I grew up

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.280
since I was 14 years old.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.640
But I can tell you exactly
what kind of wallpaper

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:28.590
was on the walls of my room
and how to get to the kitchen

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:31.940
from the dining room
and all the rest.

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.510
So that notion of home
becoming part of you,

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:36.860
there's a quote from James
Baldwin at the beginning

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:39.810
of the novel that says,
"Home is not a place,

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:42.450
it's an irrevocable condition."

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:46.390
And I think that's true as well.

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:49.800
FEMALE SPEAKER: There's a line,
perhaps the most quoted line

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:54.760
of the book that's in many
reviews is, "No one ever

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.735
leaves the town where they
grew up, even if they go."

00:09:57.735 --> 00:10:00.300
Do you think this has
a different meaning?

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.660
I'm far from my hometown.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:05.650
But some people stay
close to their hometown

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:06.770
for their entire life.

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:09.414
And do you think, is
there a different meaning,

00:10:09.414 --> 00:10:13.247
whether you stay--
you're close in distance,

00:10:13.247 --> 00:10:15.330
or do you think it sort
of holds the same meaning?

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.955
ANNA QUINDLEN: I think it holds
the same meaning for everybody.

00:10:17.955 --> 00:10:21.590
I think it sort of lives
inside you where you're from.

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:27.370
And all those years later
there are those little tells.

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:29.980
I've been a New Yorker
since I was 18 years old

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.770
and went to college in New York.

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:34.720
And today two women at
an event said to me,

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.480
I'm from Philadelphia too.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.720
Well, I am from Philadelphia.

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.610
That's where I was
born and grew up.

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:47.210
So there's that part of your
home that shapes you so much

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:49.400
that it's always part
of where you're from.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.900
FEMALE SPEAKER:
I've definitely been

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.440
told that my
Midwestern is showing

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:55.400
on a number of occasions.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.020
Let's talk a bit
about your career.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.520
How did you find
writing originally?

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:06.810
ANNA QUINDLEN: I'm a
writer because of teachers.

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:13.220
I was the kind of little girl
who got As in English and Ds

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.390
in conduct.

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:19.460
And yet whenever I would
hand in a composition or some

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:22.750
of the ham handed poetry
I wrote or the like,

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:26.290
some teacher would say to
me, this is really good.

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:29.210
I'm giving you an A. You
should keep doing this.

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:32.110
And when the single
most important adults

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:34.450
in your life--
after your parents--

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:37.720
tell you over and over again
that you're good at something,

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:41.060
you tend to continue doing it.

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.960
And I think I also
responded to it

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:49.700
so powerfully because from
the time I was very little,

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.940
the thing that I loved most in
the whole world, the thing that

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:54.750
gave me a sense that
I might actually

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:57.700
have a place in the world, even
though I was a girl growing up

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:01.130
in the 1950s and
'60s, was reading.

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:03.910
Reading was the thing
that introduced me

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:06.990
to women who got to do
so many of the things

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:10.020
that none of the
women I knew did.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:13.060
And so loving reading
as much as I did,

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:15.520
the idea of actually
producing a book

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:20.446
was kind of
enormously seductive.

00:12:20.446 --> 00:12:22.358
FEMALE SPEAKER: And
how do you think--

00:12:22.358 --> 00:12:25.840
you mentioned reading
books by women.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:29.116
And how do you think being
a woman has influenced

00:12:29.116 --> 00:12:31.670
your career and your life?

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:33.900
ANNA QUINDLEN: In
a variety of ways.

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:36.790
I actually wound up at
"The New York Times"

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:39.750
entirely because I'm female.

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:42.730
"The Times" had a
class action suit

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:49.060
brought against it charging that
it didn't pay, promote, or hire

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:50.950
women in parity with men.

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:52.900
And as part of
settling that suit,

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:58.000
they hired a whole lot
of us in 1977 and 1978.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.790
I was a 24-year-old
tabloid reporter,

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:04.380
which was in no way, shape,
or form your typical "New York

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:05.450
Times" reporter.

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:07.940
And they hired me
because of that suit.

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:10.890
And they sort of pushed
me along pretty quickly

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:14.350
because of that suit,
so that I wound up

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:18.250
becoming an editor,
getting a column,

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:21.590
and then ultimately winding
up on the op-ed page

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:25.520
and becoming the youngest person
who had been an op-ed page

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.550
columnist.

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:31.660
So I really richly
benefited from being female.

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:33.900
And frankly I think
in some ways it

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:37.415
was an advantage as
a fiction writer too.

00:13:37.415 --> 00:13:42.900
Women buy more than the lion's
share of hardcover fiction

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.600
in this country.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.310
People say to me
sometimes, well how

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:51.090
do you feel about having
a large female audience?

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:55.330
I say, if I have a large
female audience, I am set.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:59.310
So it's been mainly
a good thing for me.

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:01.900
But it's been mainly
a good thing for me

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:05.270
because, like Mimi
in the novel, I

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:09.630
was lucky enough to come of age
during second wave feminism.

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:12.310
So every year on
her birthday, I try

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:14.760
to remember to send Gloria
Steinem an email that

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.370
says thank you for my life.

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:21.890
Because I really believe that
if I had been born much earlier,

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:24.660
I would have been a
usually frustrated person

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.410
with many, many fewer
opportunities, if any.

00:14:31.651 --> 00:14:33.817
FEMALE SPEAKER: You are
somewhat unique as an author

00:14:33.817 --> 00:14:36.060
in that you've written
a lot of nonfiction

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:38.080
as well as a lot of fiction.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.318
Is there a difference
in how you approach them

00:14:40.318 --> 00:14:42.358
and how you write them
and your enjoyment

00:14:42.358 --> 00:14:43.990
of the different styles?

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:47.370
ANNA QUINDLEN: Well, fiction is
more of a challenge for me now.

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:49.150
And the thing about
writing novels

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:52.150
is you're really starting
anew with every book.

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:54.730
You're sort of frightening
yourself with every book

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:58.110
because you're setting
yourself a new task.

00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:02.360
But in terms of forcing yourself
to write when you don't feel

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:06.230
like writing, looking for
the telling detail that

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:09.250
communicates something to the
reader very quickly with just

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:15.270
a few words, keeping your prose
tight, writing sentences that

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:18.710
come out of people's mouths that
actually sound like words that

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:21.690
come out of people's mouths--
which is unfortunately

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:27.475
rarer in fiction
than one might like--

00:15:27.475 --> 00:15:29.160
they're not so different.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.560
The great thing about nonfiction
is if you hit a speed bump,

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.810
you can always go
to the notebook.

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:36.990
You know, oh, let's look
at the quotes on that.

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:39.740
Let's look at that story that
we found that's so great.

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:43.330
Oh, maybe a little bit of
data here, that kind of thing.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:44.750
There's none of that in a novel.

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:47.630
It's all gotta come out
of the notebook that's

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:49.100
your imagination.

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:51.450
But a lot of the
craft is the same.

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:56.820
And my voice is not so very
different from one form

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:57.850
to another.

00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:00.540
FEMALE SPEAKER: How do you
find-- in "Miller's Valley,"

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:03.420
Mimi has a very unique voice.

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:06.190
How do you write
different voices?

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:08.100
ANNA QUINDLEN: Writing
a first person novel

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.570
is a little bit of a challenge.

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:12.910
I mean getting the voice is
really where the action is.

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:16.190
I spend a lot of walking
around time before I ever

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:17.690
write the beginning of a novel.

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:23.190
I spend months during-- I
either walk or run for an hour

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:23.950
every morning.

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:27.810
And it looks like all I'm
doing is aerobic exercise,

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:31.870
but the truth is I do a lot
of work while I'm doing it.

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:35.200
And you know, I start to
think about a character

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.790
and what she looks like.

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:39.430
And over time if
I've convinced myself

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:42.010
that the novel is going to
be told in the first person,

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:45.200
I begin to get a sense of
her voice, of how she sounds.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:50.760
She's a very down to earth,
pragmatic, plain spoken person.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.480
And that gave me
keys to various ways

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.495
in which she would speak
that were really useful.

00:17:01.562 --> 00:17:03.239
FEMALE SPEAKER: What
about your writing

00:17:03.239 --> 00:17:06.520
sort of gives you life
and what other parts of it

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.400
that take life away?

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.210
Is it all wonderful,
or are there--

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:13.089
ANNA QUINDLEN: Oh,
none of it's wonderful.

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:16.980
It's all pretty painful
to be honest with you,

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.819
because you know, it's
especially important

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:22.200
to say this to students.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:28.069
Writing as much as anything else
is an exercise in confidence.

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:31.910
I mean, people make it all
about nouns and verbs and voice.

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:33.220
And all of that is important.

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:36.760
But what it means to
sit at the computer

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.920
and write something
for which you

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:42.630
want to find readers
is that you have

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:44.810
to have an inner
voice that's saying,

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:47.310
I have something
really important to say

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:49.460
and people should listen to me.

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:54.030
And that's a huge psychological
leap for most of us to do that,

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:57.050
so that you're always fighting
that feeling that what you have

00:17:57.050 --> 00:18:01.250
to say is not very interesting
and that there isn't anybody

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:03.370
out there who cares about it.

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:06.610
You're always fighting
that confidence battle,

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:07.700
it seems to me.

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:12.290
And people think that
the more you do this,

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:14.630
the less you have to
fight that battle.

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:18.360
And certainly you feel more
sure handed in certain ways.

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:21.220
But then you wind up
being up against yourself.

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:23.510
You know, I have a
friend who's involved

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:24.580
in the musical theater.

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:29.010
And he said, the more he did,
the more the reviews would say,

00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:31.550
well, this isn't as
good as the last thing.

00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:34.990
And so that's one of the reasons
why I don't read reviews too,

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:38.620
because the last thing
looms large when you're

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:41.144
trying to start over again.

00:18:41.144 --> 00:18:45.337
FEMALE SPEAKER: What do you to
say to students or to anyone

00:18:45.337 --> 00:18:48.420
who says, I really,
really want to write,

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.330
but I'm just so afraid to start.

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:53.300
How do you-- do you
have words that say?

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:56.120
ANNA QUINDLEN: It's
the Nike slogan.

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.670
Just do it.

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:02.340
I mean, the key to writing is
putting your butt in a chair.

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:06.380
But what I would say-- and it's
really important to say this

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:08.330
to, say, high
school students-- is

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:12.430
for some reason we've developed
this mindset in America

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:16.700
that if you're good at
something it's effortless.

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.460
And therefore people
say to me all the time,

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:21.000
oh, you must love to write.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.870
It must come so easily to you.

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:27.740
And I think God, please
let that be true some day.

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:31.380
But the problem with
that is once they've

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:34.850
absorbed that notion,
students sit down to write

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:38.550
and they find it, as I
do, as most writers do,

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:43.360
challenging and difficult.
So they say to themselves,

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.160
it's not effortless for me.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.950
Therefore I am not good at it.

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:52.950
So what I would say is that
virtually every writer I know,

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:56.550
including people who have won
the Pulitzer or the National

00:19:56.550 --> 00:20:01.770
Book Award, even the Nobel,
find it infinitely challenging.

00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:05.070
And that if you really
want to write, look,

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:07.140
there's two ways
of looking at this.

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:10.200
And the distinction
between them is important.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:15.670
The student who says to
me, I would like to write.

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:16.870
And I say well, we'll talk.

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:21.190
And the student who comes to
me and says, I'm a writer.

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:24.946
If you're saying to
yourself, I'm a writer,

00:20:24.946 --> 00:20:26.390
you just have to do it.

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:28.810
You just have to find
some way or another

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:34.360
to do it and still pay the rent,
which can be the hat trick.

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:38.050
FEMALE SPEAKER: Have you
ever-- has writing always

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:41.260
been the thing that
you wanted to do,

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:46.120
or sort of the avenue that
you wanted your life to be on.

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:48.400
Or have there been
other things that you

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.650
thought oh, that would be fun.

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:50.691
I would like to try that.

00:20:50.691 --> 00:20:52.760
ANNA QUINDLEN: You
know, I always thought

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:56.670
that if I had two lives, if I
got to have two instead of just

00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:59.490
one, I really would have
liked to practice medicine,

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:01.840
which is odd
considering the fact

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:05.550
that the only science course I
took in college was psychology.

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:09.420
But I know myself better
now and I know my strengths

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:11.080
and weaknesses better now.

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:15.680
But writing is just
one of those things--

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:20.440
I mean, as I just said,
not even after a while,

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:25.490
it's not so much what
you do as who you are.

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:28.680
It's the way you
order the world.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:33.350
And that's been true for
me for a long, long time.

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:35.280
FEMALE SPEAKER: How
important do you

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:39.970
think the written word is,
both writing and reading?

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:46.230
I read a few of your
public and private columns,

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:48.080
and there was one on
enough bookshelves

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:51.070
that you wrote about your son
and his sort of excitement

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:54.470
in finishing, and then another
one on book censorship.

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:58.110
And it seems like
access to written word

00:21:58.110 --> 00:21:59.670
is something that
you value highly.

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:03.040
ANNA QUINDLEN: It's the most
single most important aspect

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:07.270
of the democratic society,
because in a society in which

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:10.510
people read, the big
lies of demagogues

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:15.540
can't stand, because we
can tell ourselves using

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:22.170
data and facts and even our own
feelings that they're wrong,

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:24.370
that it's not true.

00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:26.895
It's why in
totalitarian societies

00:22:26.895 --> 00:22:29.720
they either destroy
or control books,

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.890
because they don't want
people to have access

00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:34.320
to that kind of information.

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:37.310
And the other thing is, it's
the thing that breaks down

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:39.010
the barriers among us.

00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:45.330
I mean, when you read
Jhumpa Lahiri's fiction,

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:49.270
you understand what it's like
to be an Asian immigrant living

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:50.260
in this country.

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:53.180
When you read the "Bluest
Eye" by Toni Morrison,

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:56.390
you understand what it's
like to be demonized simply

00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:57.810
because you're black.

00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:01.260
Men learn what it's like to
be female by reading fiction,

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:04.010
women what it's like to be male.

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:09.046
So writing makes
us feel less alone.

00:23:09.046 --> 00:23:12.170
Because not only do we read
other people's stories,

00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:15.750
but in their stories
we discover ourselves.

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:19.700
And in our society
today to feel less alone

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:23.712
is the single most
important thing, I think,

00:23:23.712 --> 00:23:25.270
that anything can do for us.

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:30.476
And books do it over
and over and over again.

00:23:30.476 --> 00:23:34.050
FEMALE SPEAKER: Do
you think that-- this

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:37.281
is a question that I think
applies to Google somewhat

00:23:37.281 --> 00:23:38.280
as a technology company.

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:42.040
Do you think there's a trade-off
between either technology

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:44.080
and our humanity?

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:46.050
As we have more
access to people,

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:48.203
are we becoming more lonely?

00:23:48.203 --> 00:23:49.970
ANNA QUINDLEN: You
know, I don't think

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:52.850
it has to be an either/or.

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:57.420
I think sometimes
it feels that way.

00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:00.280
I was keenly aware
of it one day and how

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:03.050
it didn't impinge this
important part of my life

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:06.410
when I was walking through
the park, and in front of me

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:10.750
was a woman who had
probably a two-year-old,

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:12.900
a two-year-old little
girl in a stroller.

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:16.550
And the two-year-old little
girl was facing the woman.

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:19.110
And she was doing all
the things two-year-olds

00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:23.910
try to do to say hey, I'm here,
I'm alive, engage with me.

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:26.280
And the woman was
looking at her iPhone.

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:29.760
And at first I was appalled.

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.970
And then I thought,
if I had been

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:36.160
born at a slightly different
time, that would have been me.

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.980
So I think that we have
to control tech rather

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.540
than letting tech control us.

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:47.490
But I use a lot of tech.

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:51.550
I mean, writing a
novel on a computer,

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:54.590
it makes it so much easier.

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:57.700
It makes the revision
process so much easier.

00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:01.330
It doesn't frighten
you about-- look,

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:05.310
there's only one copy of
the manuscript of Dickens'

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:06.740
"A Christmas Carol."

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:09.630
It's in the Morgan
Museum in New York.

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:12.370
If I only had one
copy of my novel,

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:15.920
I would be in a state
of terror constantly.

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:20.930
I have endless copies because
of the backup systems I have.

00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:24.660
So I think tech can
be of enormous value.

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:28.440
But I think that we have
to learn to control it.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:34.430
It's like people ask me all the
time about journalism and news

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:35.955
gathering in this society.

00:25:35.955 --> 00:25:38.600
And what I always
say is that it's

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.680
possible to be better
informed in America today

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:44.690
than at any time in the
history of this country,

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:48.430
because you don't have to rely
on one local newspaper, one

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:49.990
evening newscast.

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:53.350
You can watch the BBC.

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:55.269
You can read "The Guardian."

00:25:55.269 --> 00:25:57.560
You can read "The Times."
you can read "The Wall Street

00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:02.090
Journal" no matter where you
are in the country or the world.

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:03.680
You can read Buzzfeed.

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:05.580
You can read Politico.

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:09.700
You can be a hunter gatherer
of news for yourself.

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:13.020
But that means you need to
be an educated consumer.

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:16.100
You need to be thoughtful
about what you're doing

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.860
and where you're getting
your information from.

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:19.700
Ditto with tech.

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:22.730
You just have to be thoughtful
about what you're doing

00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:23.780
and how you're doing it.

00:26:33.986 --> 00:26:35.610
FEMALE SPEAKER: Do
you mind if I-- just

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:37.820
back to the importance
the written word.

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:40.750
And you've written
a bit and you've

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:44.663
spoken about your frustrations
with this election cycle.

00:26:47.369 --> 00:26:49.160
Sort of what lines do
you think there needs

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:59.670
to be between being
polite, being honest,

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:01.400
can you explain some
of your thoughts

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.024
and your frustrations
and your feelings

00:27:03.024 --> 00:27:06.834
about what's going on now?

00:27:06.834 --> 00:27:09.000
ANNA QUINDLEN: I think
public civility is important.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.810
I think that you can have an
animated exchange of ideas

00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:18.280
between people with vastly
different worldviews

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:22.950
without using the language
of middle school bullying.

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:24.370
I think that's really important.

00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:27.770
I mean, take an example.

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:29.470
In the "NewsHour"
from time to time

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:32.610
they have David Brooks
and E.J. Dionne talking

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:34.620
about the issues of the day.

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:37.690
They have quite different
political viewpoints.

00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:44.930
And they often differ
greatly, but never impolitely.

00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:48.940
And that doesn't mean either
of them pulls their punches.

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:55.350
It just means that they're
trying to produce light and not

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:56.625
just heat.

00:27:56.625 --> 00:27:59.090
This has been an election
cycle in which it's

00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:01.410
been heat, heat, more heat.

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:07.940
And at the end of, quite
frankly, the GOP debates,

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:11.160
I don't think there's been a
single debate where at the end

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:14.655
I think I've learned
something about a subject.

00:28:14.655 --> 00:28:19.370
I learned things about how the
men involved saw one another

00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:21.360
or saw themselves.

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:24.110
But in terms of data points,
in terms of saying gee,

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:27.430
I didn't really understand that
about the minimum wage or I

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:31.340
hadn't quite taken that into
account in our trade agreements

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:35.030
with China, not
a moment of that.

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:38.660
And you know, this
country needs that.

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:40.490
I'm willing to honor
the fact that there

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:44.850
are people who are
not like me, liberals,

00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:48.120
thoughtful conservatives
who would say to me,

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:51.900
no Anna, that's not how
we should do things.

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:53.380
But not if they
call me an idiot,

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:55.440
and not if I call them an idiot.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:59.110
That's not how we
ought to resolve

00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:04.530
the very substantial
issues that affect us

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:06.480
at this point in time.

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:09.195
FEMALE SPEAKER: I would like
to open it up to audience

00:29:09.195 --> 00:29:12.043
questions if anyone has any.

00:29:12.043 --> 00:29:14.126
If you would wait for the
mic to come back to you.

00:29:23.207 --> 00:29:24.121
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:29:24.121 --> 00:29:27.540
Thank you for an enlightening
interview so far.

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:30.130
I really liked your
comment about how

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:33.430
writing was also about writing
when you didn't want to write.

00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:36.290
And my question to
you on that was,

00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:38.920
what do you write about when
you don't want to write,

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:40.380
but you know you need to write?

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:41.990
And when you look
back on what you

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:44.600
wrote when you didn't want
to write but you did write,

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.220
do you like what you see?

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:47.350
Is it still as good?

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:49.010
Or can you tell
that you didn't want

00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:51.259
to write when you wrote what
you wrote when you didn't

00:29:51.259 --> 00:29:53.485
want to write what you wrote?

00:29:53.485 --> 00:29:55.860
ANNA QUINDLEN: I feel like
we're doing Peter Piper picked

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:57.510
a peck of pickled peppers.

00:29:57.510 --> 00:30:00.120
I have this little trick
that's really helped

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:02.520
me get over the hump each time.

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:04.300
And it's this.

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:08.210
I never knock off for the
day at the end of a chapter.

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:11.010
And I never knock off
at the end of the day

00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:12.360
at the end of a paragraph.

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:16.440
I don't even knock off
at the end of a sentence.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.190
I knock off in midsentence.

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:21.820
Because when I come back the
next morning, which is really

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:26.760
when the not wanting to write
is at its highest level, when

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:32.200
the DVR is calling
its siren song to me,

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:35.950
I can always manage to
finish an existing sentence.

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:39.130
I know where the rest
of that sentence goes.

00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:42.030
And oftentimes if I can
finish that sentence,

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:45.330
it jump starts me into
another sentence, and then

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:47.510
another, and then another.

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:51.340
And then sometimes what
happens is I'm toodling along,

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:54.710
and I'm not really
firing on all cylinders.

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:58.020
And then I get to a
sentence and I go boom.

00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:00.690
In other words,
I find frequently

00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:05.250
that halfhearted mediocre
writing done over time

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:08.900
leads to better and
even good writing.

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:11.790
I tend not to look
over my stuff.

00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:17.430
I tend to write as fast as I can
to the end of the first draft.

00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:20.070
But I can't say that
I've ever gone back,

00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:23.630
when I do go back when I've done
that first draft, to read over

00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:27.560
again and said oh, I
remember this was a bad day.

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:29.750
What I think you
remember more is

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:31.620
that there is the
occasional day--

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:34.350
and they don't come that often,
but they do come sometimes--

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:37.062
when you're thinking,
I have nothing to say.

00:31:37.062 --> 00:31:38.270
You sit down at the computer.

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:39.320
You start to write.

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:42.224
And then you start to type
really, really quickly.

00:31:42.224 --> 00:31:43.890
And when you look up,
an hour and a half

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:47.210
has gone by, because
you're totally in the zone.

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:49.470
And that's the best
feeling in the world.

00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:52.470
It's really what
keeps you doing this.

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:56.990
And I can always sort of intuit
those scenes when I go back

00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:57.680
and read over.

00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:01.557
I think yeah, that's a day
when I was really hitting it.

00:32:01.557 --> 00:32:02.390
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:32:09.146 --> 00:32:10.521
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Wait for the mic.

00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:16.740
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks for
coming and joining us here.

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:19.200
I was curious about
your relationship

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.940
with editors as part
of your writing process

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:25.010
and how that had differed
both when you were working

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:32.299
as a journalist and also just
on for the fiction, and how much

00:32:32.299 --> 00:32:33.840
sort of freedom that
you have to push

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:37.370
back and sort of how
important that relationship is

00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:38.810
in writing.

00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:42.360
ANNA QUINDLEN: I've had a very
interesting career trajectory

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:45.970
in terms of editing because
I've sort of earned the right

00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:48.180
to have less and less of it.

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:50.780
For example when I was a young
reporter at "The New York

00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:55.220
Times," editors could basically
do what they would to my copy.

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:57.400
And sometimes they did.

00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:00.480
And some of the
very good ones got

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:03.760
me to improve my
copy to the point

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:06.260
where they were
satisfied with it.

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:09.070
And of course those are
the really good ones.

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:11.400
And then once I
became a columnist,

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:13.860
columnists at "The
Times" have the right

00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:17.580
to be edited as much or as
little as they would like.

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:21.190
So they can say, hands off.

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:23.380
That's incredibly foolish.

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:27.860
It's just incredibly
foolish because you're

00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:31.660
good editors are
mirrors of your readers.

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:33.860
And if they're
able to say to you,

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:37.690
this third graph
doesn't quite track

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:41.320
to me, that means that
all over the country,

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:44.150
there would be people
sitting on the subway

00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:46.280
or at their breakfast
tables going,

00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:50.030
I'm not sure which she
means in that third graph.

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:52.420
And often it's just
a little tweak that

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:55.640
takes it from hmm to oh yeah.

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:59.460
With my novels, I have
been incredibly lucky

00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:02.810
because I've had the same editor
for every book I've ever done,

00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:04.820
Kate Medina at Random House.

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:07.430
And we really know
how to work together.

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:11.440
And what she does is, once
I finished a first draft,

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:13.900
I then read the
entire book aloud.

00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:15.690
It takes about a week.

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:21.400
Because it's by ear that I
can hear what's wrong with it.

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.630
I mean if a sentence
is way too long,

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:27.320
I'll know because I can't
breathe by the end of it.

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:32.850
That's nature's way of saying
hello, you need a semicolon.

00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:35.730
If a line of dialogue
doesn't work,

00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:38.330
when I say it out loud
I think, OK, people

00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:39.630
don't really talk like that.

00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:41.159
Time to fix that one.

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:43.290
So at the end of
the read through,

00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:45.780
I've done some work
on the manuscript.

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:47.090
And then I hand it to Kate.

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:51.000
And about three weeks later,
what I get back from her

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.449
is-- I know this is so hard
for me to have to admit,

00:34:55.449 --> 00:34:59.320
but she will not
edit except on paper.

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:01.450
It's so frustrating because
I do the whole thing

00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:02.180
on the computer.

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:04.160
I send it to her
on the computer.

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:05.740
Then she prints out paper.

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:09.290
And she does annotations
on the manuscript.

00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:12.850
And then she sends me about
a 12 to 14 page single space

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:15.810
thing that says, I love Mimi.

00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:18.240
I love the relationship
with her and her mother.

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:19.350
This is so interesting.

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:20.900
That's so interesting.

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:23.380
At the beginning of
the book, I think

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:25.940
you need a little less
backstory in the prologue.

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:30.150
Chapter one, that whole scene,
and she goes blow by blow

00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:32.740
and says, you
gotta tighten this.

00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:34.130
You gotta cut this.

00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:36.270
You ought to move this.

00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:40.730
I could basically
said, I don't think so.

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:42.670
It's fine the way it is.

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:43.780
I wouldn't do that.

00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:47.810
But I would say at this point
I probably implement about 60%

00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:50.260
to 70% of what she says.

00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:53.150
And then the other,
we just have to agree

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:55.460
to disagree about that.

00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:59.420
And it used to be that I'd
go through three drafts.

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:02.870
I'd do that second draft and do
a lot of moving and rewriting.

00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:05.230
And then she'd go
over that, and I'd

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:08.000
do kind of a
smoothing third graph.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.650
This is my eighth novel, so
I'm down to just two graphs--

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:13.820
two drafts.

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:18.110
And you know, she always,
in one way or another,

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:19.640
makes the book better.

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:24.010
Because when you're writing a
novel and it's going the way

00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:27.150
it should be going, you're
kind of living in it.

00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:30.800
I mean, they're very real to you
if you're doing it correctly.

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:32.530
But the end result
of that is you

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:35.930
have almost zero perspective
on it by the end.

00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:39.160
I mean, I almost want to
throw it out the window

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:42.380
and hope it gets to Kate,
because I've had it.

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:42.960
Enough.

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.910
I can't look at it
one more minute.

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:47.650
And so to have
somebody who knows

00:36:47.650 --> 00:36:53.650
you, who knows your work, who
can step back and say, wow,

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:54.790
I love this.

00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:59.920
But this all sort of needs to
be sharpened up a little bit.

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:02.680
Someone you trust and have
worked with for a long time

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:06.980
is just an enormous gift.

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:08.975
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm
curious about the--

00:37:08.975 --> 00:37:12.205
you said that op-ed columnists
or just columnists in general

00:37:12.205 --> 00:37:14.580
used to be able to push back
as much as much they wanted.

00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:15.370
ANNA QUINDLEN: Op
Ed page columnists.

00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:17.920
FEMALE SPEAKER: Has that
changed in recent years?

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:20.700
ANNA QUINDLEN: No, I think
it's still pretty-- I mean,

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:25.460
being an op-ed page columnist is
the single most independent job

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:26.230
at the paper.

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:29.150
As the chairman and
publisher explained to me

00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:31.690
when he offered me
the job, he would not

00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:33.510
be speaking to me
about my column

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:35.860
again unless he fired me.

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:39.700
It's because you're supposed to
be independent, because you're

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:43.690
not supposed to
feel the business

00:37:43.690 --> 00:37:46.820
departments or the
editorial departments

00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:49.160
or the power structure
of the paper looking

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:50.390
over your shoulder.

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:54.270
That's in the words
of the founder

00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:57.480
of the current iteration
of "The New York Times."

00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:02.360
You're supposed be able to
write without fear or favor.

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:04.230
And to do that
they feel that you

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:07.270
have to be really independent.

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:11.570
And along with that
you can forego editing.

00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:14.130
But I would say it's a
very foolish writer who

00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:16.865
forgoes editing.

00:38:16.865 --> 00:38:18.740
FEMALE SPEAKER: Any
other audience questions?

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:25.285
AUDIENCE: Thanks for being here.

00:38:25.285 --> 00:38:27.610
What's the most frustrating
part about being a writer?

00:38:31.084 --> 00:38:32.875
ANNA QUINDLEN: It's
all pretty frustrating.

00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:38.580
Because when you're doing
your walking around time,

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:41.900
you have an ideal in your mind.

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:44.090
I used to think I'd forgot it.

00:38:44.090 --> 00:38:48.450
You know, I used to
think I had it nailed,

00:38:48.450 --> 00:38:50.280
and somehow I just forgot it.

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:55.300
And what's on the pages is a
slightly less able iteration.

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:59.200
But it turns out that,
in a lot of jobs,

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:01.990
you have this
ideal in your mind.

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:05.110
And then there's always
that slight disconnect

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:08.260
between the ideal and the real.

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:10.780
And I think that's a
frustration that you

00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:16.050
feel like-- I was saying
the other day in terms

00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:20.620
of how I value tech
for this whole process,

00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:23.070
that there was a very
famous writer named

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:27.110
Richard Yates who wrote a novel
called "Revolutionary Road."

00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:32.430
And it's a beautiful novel,
widely praised and won prizes.

00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:34.980
But he actually had
finished that novel

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:36.730
and there was a
fire at his home.

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:39.490
And the manuscript of
the novel was destroyed.

00:39:39.490 --> 00:39:41.610
So he had to start from scratch.

00:39:41.610 --> 00:39:46.690
And the book he produced
is a great, great novel.

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:51.910
But he always insisted that
the original was better.

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:56.630
And it seems to me that that's
a reflection of what we always

00:39:56.630 --> 00:40:01.180
feel is that disconnect
between the way we see it

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:05.980
in our mind's eye and the way
it actually lays on the page.

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:09.354
And I think that's the
greatest frustration.

00:40:09.354 --> 00:40:13.410
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] if
you don't mind my asking,

00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:15.942
do you think that
it's very [INAUDIBLE]?

00:40:22.616 --> 00:40:27.960
ANNA QUINDLEN: I don't know,
because there is that moment

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:30.660
where you're satisfied.

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:33.490
When I've finished
the second draft,

00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:37.070
as a hedge against
public opinion, which

00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:39.600
can be so punishing
and so powerful,

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:42.970
I again read the novel aloud.

00:40:42.970 --> 00:40:46.560
And at the end when I
have satisfied myself

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:49.030
that this is the book
I want to publish,

00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:52.510
I actually-- this
sounds so silly,

00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:56.620
but it has become kind of an
important spiritual, if you

00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:57.760
will, component of this.

00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:01.050
I actually say to myself,
this is good work.

00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:03.830
And it's really
important because I

00:41:03.830 --> 00:41:08.670
can live on that moment
if the book isn't selling

00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:12.380
very well, if I hear
that the reviews are bad,

00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:16.550
if any of the
negative things that

00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:19.260
can be follow the publication
of a book are happening.

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:22.250
I can still remember the
moment where I said to myself,

00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:24.600
this is good work.

00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:26.640
So obviously there
is that moment

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:30.090
where you're satisfied with
it going out into the world.

00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:32.710
But you know, there
are all those stories

00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:36.470
about various famous painters
who finish a painting

00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:38.830
and then paint over it
again because it's always

00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:40.760
the next thing, the next thing.

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:43.850
Maybe it's the essence
of the human condition,

00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:45.490
that if we only get
to the next thing,

00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:48.401
that will be the right thing.

00:41:48.401 --> 00:41:53.584
AUDIENCE: Because your answer's
so authentic [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:53.584 --> 00:41:57.413
I appreciate the eloquence with
which you kind of encourage

00:41:57.413 --> 00:41:58.954
people who are
thinking about writing

00:41:58.954 --> 00:42:02.016
or who want to write
actually [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:02.016 --> 00:42:04.992
You spoke earlier about
how one personal challenge

00:42:04.992 --> 00:42:07.472
you both have is [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:12.928 --> 00:42:16.400
I think another challenge
or personal challenge is,

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.380
am I going to be successful?

00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:18.880
[INAUDIBLE]

00:42:22.352 --> 00:42:25.328
You go to a big tech
company [INAUDIBLE],

00:42:25.328 --> 00:42:27.808
even if you're not
great at your job,

00:42:27.808 --> 00:42:29.792
you still get the
benefits, still

00:42:29.792 --> 00:42:34.752
get to shirk off work
on a Friday [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:34.752 --> 00:42:37.232
And there's [INAUDIBLE]
that if I put it

00:42:37.232 --> 00:42:41.696
all into a [INAUDIBLE], I'm
not very good, [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:41.696 --> 00:42:46.260
Do you have a secret
sauce or any [INAUDIBLE]?

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:47.415
ANNA QUINDLEN: No.

00:42:47.415 --> 00:42:49.790
That's why I went into
the newspaper business.

00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:51.710
I really wanted
to be a novelist,

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:53.420
but I couldn't
for the life of me

00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:55.230
figure out how you
could be a novelist

00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:56.380
and make a living at it.

00:42:56.380 --> 00:43:00.190
There's no obvious career
path to becoming a writer.

00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:03.950
So luckily for me I went
into the newspaper business

00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:05.250
originally to pay the rent.

00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:07.470
And then I found
it so incredibly

00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:11.380
seductive and rewarding that
I just stayed and stayed

00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:12.700
and stayed and stayed.

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:15.950
So the answer is that some
people who are writers

00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:21.080
find straight jobs and
write for an hour every day

00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:23.210
either before or after.

00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:27.800
Some try to write
for freelance outlets

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:31.170
where they can eke out a
meager living while they're

00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:33.030
working on the great book.

00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:36.480
And some just
don't do it at all.

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:40.010
I remember at one point--
all three of my children

00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:41.530
in various ways are writers.

00:43:41.530 --> 00:43:46.560
And at one point, our oldest
son speaks fluent Mandarin.

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:48.590
And his father
suggested that he go

00:43:48.590 --> 00:43:51.830
to work for one of the big
investment banks in Beijing,

00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:54.680
and he could do
that for 10 years

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:58.680
and stockpile enough
money to live on and work

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:00.330
full time as a novelist.

00:44:00.330 --> 00:44:03.530
And Quinn said, "Dad,
that's not how it works.

00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:06.240
If I take that job,
I'll never leave."

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:09.100
And I think there's a
lot of truth to that.

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:15.300
So it does take guts, and it
takes a belief in yourself.

00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:18.420
And it also takes a
willingness, a year or two out,

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:20.170
to say this isn't
working out and I've

00:44:20.170 --> 00:44:24.450
got to circle around to
a straighter job again.

00:44:24.450 --> 00:44:28.500
I was lucky in that the
job I found to get me here

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:34.140
was a job that helped
me do what I do here,

00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:40.480
and also one that just fed my
soul every day that I did it

00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:41.353
as a reporter.

00:44:44.009 --> 00:44:45.675
FEMALE SPEAKER: I
have another question.

00:44:45.675 --> 00:44:51.280
Are there parts of your public
identity I guess as a writer

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:55.330
that you are particularly proud
of and parts that you're, no, I

00:44:55.330 --> 00:44:57.280
don't want to be known
as that, or I don't

00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:00.030
want to be known like that?

00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:01.630
ANNA QUINDLEN: Well
my public identity

00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:04.085
as a writer is
really bifurcated.

00:45:04.085 --> 00:45:09.990
As a journalist, I'd like to
think as a columnist that I did

00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:13.250
would H.L. Mencken once said
a good columnist should do,

00:45:13.250 --> 00:45:16.000
and that is to "afflict
the comfortable and comfort

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.770
the afflicted."

00:45:17.770 --> 00:45:23.710
I was intensely interested
in the issues that affect

00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:26.850
the poorest American citizens.

00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:28.980
And I wrote about them
over and over again.

00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:32.110
And I hope that maybe
in some small corners

00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:33.600
I made a difference.

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:37.580
And as a novelist, people will
tell me over and over again

00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:43.070
that I did make them feel more
connected to their deepest

00:45:43.070 --> 00:45:45.830
selves, I mean, sometimes
in really profound

00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:46.910
and specific ways.

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:51.220
I wrote a novel called "Black
and Blue" about a nurse

00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:53.690
who is married to a police
officer who beats her,

00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:56.460
and who flees from
him with their son.

00:45:56.460 --> 00:46:02.510
And a woman told me that she
called 911 for the first time

00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:04.510
while she was holding the book.

00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:06.520
And you know, if
that doesn't make

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:13.310
you feel both significant
and small at the same time,

00:46:13.310 --> 00:46:14.535
then nothing else will.

00:46:14.535 --> 00:46:18.800
Or women whose mother died when
they were younger, as mine did,

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:23.160
and as I reflected both in
nonfiction and in fiction,

00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:26.490
feel some kind of an
affinity for me and my work.

00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:30.490
And I'm happy for that
part of the public persona.

00:46:30.490 --> 00:46:34.030
I hate the part of the public
persona that's distancing,

00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:39.500
that makes it sound
as though somehow I

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:42.120
have some special gift.

00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:45.958
I mean, so much of this is
just pushing the rock uphill.

00:46:49.230 --> 00:46:51.256
FEMALE SPEAKER: Time for
another question or two

00:46:51.256 --> 00:46:52.631
if anyone else
has any questions?

00:46:55.311 --> 00:46:56.769
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] today.

00:46:56.769 --> 00:46:59.060
I wonder if you could talk
a little bit about your kind

00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:00.600
of daily writing process.

00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:02.677
I rented a cottage
way up in the hills,

00:47:02.677 --> 00:47:04.760
thought it would be great
to give myself two years

00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:06.060
to work on a book project.

00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:09.370
And I am so easily distracted
and profoundly committed

00:47:09.370 --> 00:47:13.780
to procrastination,
it's blowing my mind.

00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:15.460
ANNA QUINDLEN: OK, ditto.

00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:19.880
So here's my deal.

00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:23.880
First of all the only way
that I can work successfully

00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:28.490
is to have an incredibly
boring set to music life.

00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:31.380
I don't travel a whole lot.

00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:35.880
My social life is kind
of-- Edna O'Brien,

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:38.910
the great Irish novelist,
just had this incredible quote

00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:44.470
in "The Times" where she said
something about "the real life

00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:46.620
is back at the desk."

00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:48.780
And I knew exactly
what she meant.

00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:53.100
She was lamenting how hard it
is for your life because so much

00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:56.700
of where you are is
in this other world.

00:47:56.700 --> 00:48:00.140
So I have a whole
routine every morning

00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:03.680
which is designed to
prevent me from writing.

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:06.540
So first I have breakfast.

00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:10.470
Then I have this hour's
worth of aerobics exercise.

00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:12.930
Then I read four newspapers.

00:48:12.930 --> 00:48:15.400
Then I talk to my best
friend on the telephone.

00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:20.820
Then depending on-- I'll
fold towels if I-- the thing

00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:25.620
is, I run out of stuff at
about 9:30 in the morning.

00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:29.970
And that's the moment when I
just give up and go upstairs

00:48:29.970 --> 00:48:31.140
to my office.

00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:33.240
And then once I go to
my office, I sort of

00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:35.650
say OK, you can't
leave until lunch time,

00:48:35.650 --> 00:48:38.540
and just sit there and do it.

00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:41.756
And then I come down and
have lunch usually with my--

00:48:41.756 --> 00:48:45.810
or often with my eldest,
who also works in our house.

00:48:45.810 --> 00:48:49.280
And then I usually go back
upstairs for an hour or two

00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:50.380
afterwards.

00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:53.890
I can't work on a novel more
than two or three hours a day,

00:48:53.890 --> 00:48:56.780
not because I can't write more
than that, because there were

00:48:56.780 --> 00:48:59.940
days when I was a
columnist or a reporter

00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:03.480
when I would write for
eight, 10, 12 hours straight.

00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:07.430
It's the imagination
starts to dull over time.

00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:11.680
And so then I will work on
answering emails or writing

00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:14.540
speeches or things like that.

00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:17.870
And then the next
day, midsentence, I

00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:19.580
start up and do it again.

00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:25.580
But life has to be really
boring, not a whole lot

00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:27.010
of dinner invitations.

00:49:27.010 --> 00:49:29.320
If you want to
meet me for a meal

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:32.070
to talk about business,
which I actually

00:49:32.070 --> 00:49:34.590
do with some regularity,
it has to be breakfast

00:49:34.590 --> 00:49:38.430
because I can't go into
that belly of the day

00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:40.010
or I've lost the whole day.

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:44.070
I really have to have
those three or four

00:49:44.070 --> 00:49:47.010
hours just chunked out there.

00:49:47.010 --> 00:49:49.560
And sometimes it's
better not to do it

00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:53.410
in some nice little cottage
out in the middle of nowhere,

00:49:53.410 --> 00:49:55.710
although I do do
that in the summer.

00:49:55.710 --> 00:49:57.880
We have a weekend
house and that's

00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:01.040
where I live during the summer
and I have this little shack

00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:04.490
kind of thing that
I built out there.

00:50:04.490 --> 00:50:06.690
But sometimes it's
important to just

00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:09.910
have a regular daily
routine with writing

00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:11.280
smack dab in the middle.

00:50:15.690 --> 00:50:18.140
FEMALE SPEAKER: All
right, one last question.

00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:31.195
AUDIENCE: Have you ever
just given up on a novel?

00:50:31.195 --> 00:50:33.900
Or let's see even
a column, realize

00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:37.110
that it wasn't happening,
the story didn't make sense,

00:50:37.110 --> 00:50:41.626
or rather it just
didn't complete itself?

00:50:41.626 --> 00:50:43.500
Or do you always push
through and then decide

00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:44.304
what to do with it?

00:50:44.304 --> 00:50:45.970
ANNA QUINDLEN: Actually
I have one novel

00:50:45.970 --> 00:50:48.420
that died on the vine.

00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:51.540
It would have been my third.

00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:55.090
And I wrote the draft.

00:50:55.090 --> 00:50:57.140
And I was happy with it.

00:50:57.140 --> 00:51:00.230
And my agent and my editor
were both happy with it.

00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:03.380
And so my editor sent
me all the things

00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:07.100
that I described to you earlier
for the editing process.

00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:10.670
And what I found is no matter
how much I worked on it,

00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:12.040
I didn't make it better.

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:13.290
I made it worse.

00:51:13.290 --> 00:51:16.140
I made it flatter.

00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:20.910
As opposed to coming to life,
the life drained out of it

00:51:20.910 --> 00:51:22.170
is what it came down to.

00:51:22.170 --> 00:51:24.650
And I handed in the
revisions to my editor

00:51:24.650 --> 00:51:26.620
and she knew the same thing.

00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:30.040
And there was a moment when
she called me and asked if we

00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:32.040
could have lunch with my agent.

00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:34.510
And I knew that it
was the being called

00:51:34.510 --> 00:51:36.540
to the principal's office call.

00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:40.120
It was the, this is not
working very well call.

00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:44.650
But luckily before they
could say anything, I said,

00:51:44.650 --> 00:51:47.020
I've already
started a new novel.

00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:50.440
It's about a nurse whose husband
is a cop who beats her up.

00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:51.900
And it's called
"Black and Blue."

00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:56.350
And you could see both of them
just let out a sigh of relief

00:51:56.350 --> 00:51:59.300
that we didn't have to
have that conversation.

00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:03.680
In the years since,
I've decided and I've

00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:06.570
realized in conversation
with some of my colleagues

00:52:06.570 --> 00:52:10.900
that that novel is what I
think of as a chop shop novel.

00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:13.580
In other words, there are
various elements of it

00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:16.160
that I've used for other books.

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:20.200
There are sort of variations
of characters that were in it

00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:23.200
that have popped up in
other novels and settings

00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:25.080
and so on and so forth.

00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:27.810
And it appears
from conversations

00:52:27.810 --> 00:52:29.610
I've had like there's
a lot of us who

00:52:29.610 --> 00:52:32.380
have that kind of book
somewhere, the book that didn't

00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:37.460
quite work, but which can
be used inspirationally

00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:40.150
to get you going on other books.

00:52:40.150 --> 00:52:43.860
So it would be
completely unusable now

00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:50.170
because I've chopped it up so
much and used it elsewhere.

00:52:50.170 --> 00:52:51.940
But it was a valuable lesson.

00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:54.720
And it was a valuable
lesson to learn

00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:58.110
early on, because clearly one
of the things I said to myself

00:52:58.110 --> 00:52:59.940
was, this isn't working.

00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:02.640
Therefore I have to
start immediately

00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:04.200
on something
completely different

00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:06.666
to get the motor running again.

00:53:06.666 --> 00:53:08.800
AUDIENCE: All right, thank you.

00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:10.773
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:10.773 --> 00:53:11.606
ANNA QUINDLEN: Sure.

00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:17.360
AUDIENCE: You see a lot of
posthumously published works.

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:20.440
Even if you think
you've chopped it up,

00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:22.850
have you put any kind of
a prohibition in place

00:53:22.850 --> 00:53:25.480
to prevent that from
ever being published?

00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:28.760
ANNA QUINDLEN: I actually have
a very fine literary executor

00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:34.590
to whom I gave birth 32 years
ago who understands completely

00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:37.820
how the world of
publishing works

00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:40.190
and who knows me
down to the ground.

00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:43.450
And we had an
animated conversation

00:53:43.450 --> 00:53:47.590
about this when "Go Set a
Watchman" was published,

00:53:47.590 --> 00:53:50.160
because I was kind
of horrified by that.

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:53.730
I'm quite convinced that
that was a chop shop novel

00:53:53.730 --> 00:53:56.540
and that it wound
up giving birth

00:53:56.540 --> 00:54:00.520
to one of the transcendent books
of the 20th century, "To Kill

00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:02.640
a Mockingbird."

00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:07.050
And Quinn understands very
well that if it didn't

00:54:07.050 --> 00:54:09.410
see the light of
day when I wrote it,

00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:12.980
there's a reason for that.

00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:14.480
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Thank you very much.

00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:15.521
ANNA QUINDLEN: Thank you.

00:54:15.521 --> 00:54:18.020
FEMALE SPEAKER: And I
think-- are you available

00:54:18.020 --> 00:54:20.000
for a few minutes
afterwards for book signing?

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:20.390
ANNA QUINDLEN: Sure.

00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:21.931
FEMALE SPEAKER: All
right, thank you.

00:54:21.931 --> 00:54:23.551
ANNA QUINDLEN: Thanks.
