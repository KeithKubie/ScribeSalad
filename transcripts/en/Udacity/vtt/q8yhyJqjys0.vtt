We just saw that if we replaced c in our original equation with c plus 4, we end

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.394
up with a simplified equation that is what I just read off. Now, I'd like to

00:00:09.394 --> 00:00:13.904
show you how the graphs of the old equation and the new equation compare. The

00:00:13.904 --> 00:00:18.714
first equation we had is shown by this blue curve, and the new equation is shown

00:00:18.714 --> 00:00:23.332
by this orange yellow one. Now, the difference between these two graphs is

00:00:23.332 --> 00:00:27.562
really that the orange one is shifted four units to the left of the blue one.

00:00:27.562 --> 00:00:31.840
And we can see that shift written in the equation in the first version of the

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.285
new equation that we had, where we have these c plus 4s visible. However, this

00:00:36.285 --> 00:00:40.739
form is really not very pretty, which is why we wanted to simplify it. Although

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.447
the simplified version looks better, we can't see this shift. The situation for

00:00:45.447 --> 00:00:49.229
horizontal shifts then, seems kind of different from the vertical shifts

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:53.210
situation. We saw earlier that if we wanted to lower a graph, we just needed to

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.088
change this constant term, in order to change all of the vertical values. I

00:00:57.088 --> 00:01:01.057
think we're going to need new form for the equation of a parabola, in order to

00:01:01.057 --> 00:01:04.489
show changes in horizontal direction a little bit more clearly.
