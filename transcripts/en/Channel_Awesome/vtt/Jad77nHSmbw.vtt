00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.820
Greetings people of the world.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.860
For years, you've been under the assumption that my uncle Inspector Gadget was a respected detective

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.840
for the Metro City Police Force.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.360
This was all just a cunning ruse.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.960
Did you really think such a bumbling dick with the voice of Don Adams could accomplish super impossible feats

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.380
and still be human?

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.280
For God's sake! He has a f**king helicopter in his head!

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.220
And yet, nobody questions where the hell his brain is!

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.600
I created the Gadget 9000 prototype

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.020
and you dumbasses fell for it!

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.340
And now that I've created artificial life, I shall unleash it on an unsuspecting world!

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.700
Your tanks and stealth bombers are no match for the hellfire I'm about to unleash!

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.260
Do you know how difficult it was to constantly be in the shadows as that incompetent SHIT got all the credit?!

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.220
I compressed the entire internet into my textbook!

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.780
Taught a canine how to simulate human speech

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.020
and created the Apple Watch before Steve Jobs was out of his mother's basement!

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.720
Gimme another ten years! I would've created a f**king Matrix

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.800
complete with a Keanu Reeves that can actually act!

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.580
You thought the real enemy was M.A.D. but they were merely a distraction.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.040
As long as Gadget and Claw fought, the police were always occupied.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.340
For you see, I was foiling M.A.D.'s plans so that when the time came

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.880
I could seize control of your governments

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.600
your thermal nuclear warheads

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:26.600
YOUR LIVES!!

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.540
I am PENNY! Mother of gadgets!

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.020
Breaker of brains!

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.900
I will take back the honor that was stolen from me and destroy those who stand in my way!

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.600
Isn't that right Uncle Gadget?

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.740
*WOWZERS*

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.720
Penny for your thoughts, bitches!

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.920
Does that work?

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.480
Ya but, you were supposed to just say

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.720
"Ooo, I don't like that Uncle Gadget."

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.760
Ya, not anymore

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:02.400
Okay
