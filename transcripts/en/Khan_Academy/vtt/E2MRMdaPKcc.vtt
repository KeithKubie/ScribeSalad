Let's now attempt to apply Stokes' theorem

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.466
And so over here we have this little diagram, and we have this path

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.133
that we're calling C, and it's the intersection of the plain Y+Z=2, so that's the plain that

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.333
kind of slants down like that, its the intersection of that plain

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.133
and the cylinder, you know I shouldn't even call it a cylinder

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.066
because if you just have x^2 plus y^2 is equal to one, it would essentially be like a pole,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.866
an infinite pole that keeps going up forever and keeps going down forever

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.666
so it would never have a top or a bottom

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.333
but we slice that pole, with y plus z is equal to 2, to get where they intersect

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600
we get our path C. We also have this vector field defined in this way
