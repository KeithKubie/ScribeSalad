00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.040
All right. Let's here it.

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.980
&gt;&gt; Okay. So here's the process that I went through.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.620
I'm just going to talk this out. I haven't actually worked it

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.039
out in my head yet. So what's the probability that there

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.920
isn't a storm? Well the way you have this drawn it

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.960
actually makes it pretty easy to see. I can just look

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.470
at the cases where storm is false, and it turns out

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.680
there's two of them. And I can just add those probabilities

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.310
over there, and I get .05 plus .30, and that gives

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.653
me .35.

00:00:25.653 --> 00:00:29.220
&gt;&gt; That's great. Yes, so that's exactly what

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.300
you did. So you went through, and now all

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.960
that matters in the universe are the cases where

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.040
they're not a storm and that ended up being

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.600
these two numbers. And you said, well Those are

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.110
two different cases that can happen. We'll just add

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.425
their probabilities because they're not overlapping and you've got

00:00:43.425 --> 00:00:45.535
.35. Great. All right what about the second question?

00:00:45.535 --> 00:00:47.560
&gt;&gt; Okay, so that's probability that there's

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.000
lightning in a world where there's a storm

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.580
so I'm going to do a very similar trick. I'm going

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.760
to look at the cases where storm happens to be true.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.730
And conveniently they're the first two rows and I have

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.500
two cases, so we know the probability of there being a

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.250
storm is 0.65 which is good, because 0.65 and 0.35

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.380
add up to one. But that's not the probability of there

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.860
being lightening, given there is a storm. So, of those two

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.190
cases, there's only one where lightening is happening, windstorm is happening,

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:23.902
and that's 0.25. But 0.25 isn't enough because it's only 0.25 out of 0.65.

00:01:23.902 --> 00:01:24.390
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.756
&gt;&gt; So the correct answer would be 0.25

00:01:26.756 --> 00:01:32.440
divided by 0.65. Which is, some number. 5 13th's?

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.620
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's 5 13th's. And, though I'd

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.170
rather that people fill it in as a fraction.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.180
&gt;&gt; As a, wait. That is a 5 13ths is a fraction.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.220
&gt;&gt; Good point. As a point something something. A decimel.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.030
&gt;&gt; So, 5 13ths is obviously 0.4615. And there you go. Is that right?

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.430
&gt;&gt; Yes. That was perfect. Yeah so its usually when there's a

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.870
storm, its not lightningy. It's less than half the time. That makes sense.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.930
&gt;&gt; It does because otherwise lightning would be happening all the time.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.430
&gt;&gt; Well when its storming. It could

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.970
be that its very likely when its storming.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.230
&gt;&gt; It is likely when it's storming, but it wouldn't be happening

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.260
every time its storming because otherwise it would be lightning all the time

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.770
when its storming.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:07.070
&gt;&gt; RIght.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.729
&gt;&gt; And often there's breaks between lighting. In fact, most of the time

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.980
there's not lightning, at least outside my window. At 2pm. In the summer.
