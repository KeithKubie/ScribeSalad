00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.019
So let us take a look at what is a cognitive system.

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:07.060
Notice that I'm using the term cognitive system and

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.970
not the term knowledge-based AI agent. I could have used that term also.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:17.130
When we talk about knowledge-based AI agent, then we could take two views.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.770
One view is that we are going to build a knowledge-based AI system, which need

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.880
not be human like. Another view is that the knowledge based AI agent that

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.282
we will build will be human-like. The cognitive system is situated in the world.

00:00:30.282 --> 00:00:34.310
Here by the world I mean the physical world. For example, the world that I

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.330
am interacting with right now, with this screen in front of me and

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.350
this microphone. This world is perceptionate. There's an example, the percept

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.770
something being a straight line or a color of some object. Or the smoothness of

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.670
some of the texture of some object. This perceptionate around the world and

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.760
cognitive system is using sensors to perceive this percept. That's the input of

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.540
the cognitive system. The cognitive system also has some actuators. So, for

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.750
example, I have fingers that I'm using right now to point to things. And

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.230
a cognitive system uses actuators to carry out actions on the world.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:19.030
Cognitive system then is taking perceptor's input and giving actions as output.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.000
So far, we've talked about a single cognitive system. But of course one can have

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.120
multiple cognitive systems. These multiple cognitive systems can interact with

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.920
each other. Just like a cognitive system situated in a physical world,

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.560
it is also situated in a social world. Let us now zoom into the inside

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.960
of a cognitive system. What is the architecture of a cognitive system?

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.260
So the cognitive system takes as input certain percepts about the world. It has

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.140
a task of giving as output actions of the world. The question then becomes, how

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.350
can these percepts be mapped into actions? One way of mapping them is that we

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.780
will do a direct mapping. These percepts will be directly mapped into actions.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.940
Let's take an example. Imagine that you're driving a car, and the brake lights

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.420
of the car in front of you, become bright red. Should that happen, you will then

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.290
press on the brakes of your car. Well, that is an example of a reactive system.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.095
The percepts were that the break lights on the car in front of you became bright

00:02:22.095 --> 00:02:26.460
red and the action was that you pressed on your own brakes. In doing so,

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.750
you may not have planned. This is now a direct mapping of percept into actions.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.540
Alternatively, consider a slightly different problem.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.210
Again you're driving you're car on the highway, but

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:42.360
as you're trying to drive on the highway your task this time is to change lanes.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.860
Now, in order to change lanes, again you may look around and

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.970
look at the percept of the road. There are other cars on the road, for

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.179
example, and you need to take some action that will help you change lanes.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.910
This time you may actually deliberate, you may actually look at

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.510
the goal that you have as well as the percepts of the environment and

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.710
come up with a plan that will tell you what action to take. As we discussed in

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.050
the last lesson, the deliberation itself has a number of components in it.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.400
Three of the major components that we'll studying in this class are learning,

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.610
reasoning, and memory. These three components interact with each other in

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.040
many interesting ways that we will decipher as we go along.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.820
Now, deliberation was reasoning about the world around us. So

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.780
if I take that example again of changing lanes, as I'm driving on the highway,

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.190
then I'm reasoning about the world around me. Where are the other cars? Should I

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.390
change lanes to the left or to the right. Metacognition on the other hand,

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.490
the third layer here, has to do with reasoning about the internal mental world.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.470
So metacognition reasons about the deliberation. Or metacognition can

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.310
also reason about reaction. Let us take an example of the metacognition also.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.130
Image again that I had to change lanes. And I did,

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.240
as I changed lanes to the left, the cars behind me honk because I

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.760
did not leave enough space for the car that was already moving on the left lane.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.380
In that case I know that the lane changing did not go very smoothly.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.399
I may now think about my own actions in the world, about the deliberation that

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:27.030
led to those actions, and I may then decide to change or reconfigure, or

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.200
repair the deliberation that led to that sub-optimal plan for

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.380
changing the lanes. That is an example of metacognition. So now I

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.490
have this three layered architecture, reaction, deliberation, metacognition.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.620
Note that we have defined intelligence in a way, intelligence here is

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.270
about mapping percepts in the world, interactions in the world. Intelligence is

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.480
about selecting the right kind of action given a particular state of the world.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.256
But there are many different ways in which we can map the percepts into actions.

00:04:58.256 --> 00:05:02.810
Purely reactive, deliberative, or

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:08.390
also entailing metacognition on the deliberation and the reaction. This then is

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.490
the overall architecture of the cognitive system. This is called a three layered

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.960
architecture. We'll be returning to this architecture many times in this course.
