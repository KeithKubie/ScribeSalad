was run they didn't need it anymore they

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640
was run they didn't need it anymore they
 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.060

left it they just walked away basically
 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.590
left it they just walked away basically
and then they gave it to the city of

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600
and then they gave it to the city of
 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.810
and then they gave it to the city of
Jackson Mississippi and they didn't know

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820
Jackson Mississippi and they didn't know
 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:24.740
