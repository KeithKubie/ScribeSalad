Congratulations on finishing another project. Here is your assignment.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.450
Now that we've seen classes in two different projects,

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.190
for instance with Turtle and Twilio Rest Client, we

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.720
want you to answer the following questions on the discussion

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.059
forum. The first question is, what is a class?

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.950
The next one is, what is an instance of

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.720
a class? And finally, thus far we have compared

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.300
a class to a blueprint. Can you think of another

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.650
analogy to explain classes? Make sure to check this

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.190
box, after you have submitted your responses on the forum.
