00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.380
Flexbox, is one of the most powerful
tools that you can use for layout.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.490
It's changed a lot in the last
couple years, but at this point,

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.660
it's hit candidate recommendation and
it's supported by most browsers.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.610
In this class, I'm just going to
show you the current syntax.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.510
But, in your code and for
anything you're building.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.570
For production, I want you to make
sure that you're including all of

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.190
the vendor prefixed version.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.290
So that way,

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.800
if anybody's on an older browser,
you're not leaving them out in the cold.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.720
&gt;&gt; The reason Flexbox is so powerful.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.350
Is its ability to fill
the space available.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.520
If an element has extra room around it,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.810
it'll expand to fit or if it's getting
crowded elements will shrink, so

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.590
that they take up as
little space as possible.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:43.910
Let me show you an example.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.670
Flex box makes it super easy to position
elements left or right, without floats.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.320
You can also change the order of
elements, without changing HTML,

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.510
and flex box makes it really
easy to accomplish a lot of

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.920
other common layout techniques.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.630
Pete, how do you approach
design with flex boxes?

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:00.880
&gt;&gt; Well, let me show you.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:01.380
&gt;&gt; Cool.
