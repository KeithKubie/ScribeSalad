00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:15.351
Buenas tardes.&nbsp;Good afternoon great Princeton
Class of 2018! Congratulations, huh?

00:00:15.351 --> 00:00:16.640
Thank you so much for having me here.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:24.511
Thank you President Eisgruber, trustees, faculty, parents, family

00:00:24.511 --> 00:00:33.140
members, and friends.&nbsp;As I walked in I remembered
36 years ago when I entered this Chapel for

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:40.670
the first time.&nbsp;Then-President Bill Bowen
and many mentors, especially Arcadio Diaz

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:48.400
Quiñones, welcomed us, so I want to thank
them first, because they did what I call a

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:55.260
remarkable job welcoming in a young group
of students in 1982.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:03.079
I am a member of the great Class of 1986,
and the second member of my class to speak

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:13.409
at Baccalaureate.&nbsp;Both of us are featured
on page 62 of our yearbook, the Nassau Herald,

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:25.389
just one next to the other. 
We were both members of Quad Club

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:34.130
and we were friends.&nbsp;He was really into
computers. … At our 10th reunion, after many,

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:46.539
many beers, he was talking about using the
emerging internet to sell books, and we all

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:55.689
thought he was nuts! Well you all know what
happened. … He is now the wealthiest man in

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:58.025
the world and I am not.

00:01:58.025 --> 00:02:04.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.719
So, I believe Jeff Bezos’ Amazon is doing

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:21.450
quite well. So, my first advice to you is
always attend Reunions. Always have as many

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:34.189
beers as you did last night, but invest early
in your classmates’ crazy ideas!

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:40.099
I am here to talk to you about public service.
But a different type of public service.

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:48.130
So, where should I start?&nbsp;Well,
I pledge my honor that I have not violated

00:02:48.130 --> 00:03:00.489
the Honor Code during the 
preparation of these remarks!

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.280
I know, I know. I know the whole controversy
this year. I’m not going to go into that.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:13.871
Since the late 19th&nbsp;century those words have
been an integral part of Princeton. Allow

00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:22.120
me to put them in context.&nbsp;Archivist April
Armstrong has documented that cheating … cheating

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:30.700
ran rampant at Princeton at the time.&nbsp;
Students saw it as a way to outwit the faculty, while

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:37.900
professors spent a great deal of energy trying
to catch cheaters.&nbsp;But something really

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:45.180
big happened: Student dissatisfaction with
that conduct of dishonesty and “sly warfare”

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:57.060
peaked in 1893.&nbsp;Back then, the most influential
seniors said enough is enough, and they themselves

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:04.829
proposed an honor pledge, and I quote, “to
elevate the standard of college morality.”

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:11.510
What do I love about that story?
Our Honor Code was not imposed on students.&nbsp;The

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:21.200
the leadership, the courage, the vision came from the
senior class.&nbsp;And they succeeded.&nbsp;Here

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:30.770
we are, 125 years later still embracing those
words.&nbsp;It is a three-step process:

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:37.900
First, a personal commitment to integrity,
and high standards of behavior.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:44.760
Second, a commitment to hold others accountable
to a high standard of integrity.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.860
And third, it’s a story about having the
courage to act.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:59.480
You are about to depart Princeton. Believe
me, believe me … in the polarized political

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:08.770
and social environment of 2018, those words
are more important than ever.&nbsp;They represent

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:17.260
a commitment, a promise, and a responsibility
to confront an old and dangerous disease that

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:25.920
has destroyed many institutions and many nations
in the past, a disease that is making its

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:37.400
return with a vengeance: the culture of institutional
lies; what is now called “alternative facts.”

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.410
I decided many years ago that public service
was the vehicle to help right what I believe

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:48.310
is so wrong in America and in Puerto Rico.&nbsp;
Allow me to share with you my own roller coaster

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:55.580
life in politics, law and public service over
the past 30 years going back and forth between

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:00.320
different worlds; from the beautiful island
of Puerto Rico, to the complexities of Washington

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.160
D.C.; from many states of the union, 
to countries in Latin America.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.020
I am the son of Carmen,&nbsp;a “wise Latina”

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:15.360
born and raised in Puerto Rico. My mother
attended college in Massachusetts in the 1950s

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:25.080
at a time of profound racism in America.&nbsp;
I am also the son of Mohinder, an Indian man,

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:32.530
a Punjabi Sikh from Mirpur, in northern India.
His parents, siblings, and entire village were

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:40.490
massacred in 1947 by Muslim troops during
the cruel partition war between emerging Pakistan

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:48.990
and India.&nbsp;But despite their painful experiences,
and far from the hostility, hate, and resentment

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:57.400
that they could have very well borne, I grew
up in a home full of love, tolerance, and inclusion.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.870
My parents taught me to speak up for those
who don’t have a voice and to love&nbsp;al prójimo,

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.740
love thy neighbor.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:13.530
Before I was born, my mother and father briefly
lived in Washington, D.C.&nbsp;On August 28,

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:19.930
1963, they joined thousands on the Washington
Mall to listen to a young African American

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:26.460
by the name of Martin Luther King.&nbsp;That
passionate “I have a dream” speech is

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:33.150
one of the most forceful, persuasive, and inspiring
acts of defiance of a young generation trying

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:41.590
to instill honor and integrity in this country’s
history. A simple, yet compelling principle:

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:50.560
what matters … what matters is the content
of our character, not the color of our skin.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:59.140
It frightens me that more than 50 years later,
the opposite notion seems to be resurging

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:06.871
in today’s United States.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I was born in El Salvador in May 1964 — so

00:08:06.871 --> 00:08:22.230
even Woody Woos can do the math in here; it
takes one to know one — exactly nine months

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:38.710
after Dr. King’s speech.&nbsp;Apparently, my
parents took to the next level Dr. King’s

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:43.940
admonition that “this is no time to engage
in the luxury of cooling off.”

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:54.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.920
My parents had moved then to El Salvador to
work at the U.S. Embassy in a project to fight

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:06.000
poverty in Central America, as part of President
Kennedy’s Alliance for Progress. So, I am

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:17.240
a proud Puerto Rican, conceived in El Salvador,
sorry in Washington, D.C., born in El Salvador,

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:22.680
with an Indian father, a Puerto Rican mother
and married to a wonderful woman from Panama.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:29.520
Imagine how much fun I have 
filling out the census form!

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:33.740
After Princeton, as President Eisgruber was saying, I spent a year in Chile.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:39.840
It was 1986, and General Pinochet. His cruel

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:46.270
and repressive dictatorship, based on deceit,
lying about the principles of democracy and

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:53.760
a well-orchestrated state system to manipulate
public facts was in full force. I worked part

00:09:53.760 --> 00:10:00.530
time with the Vicaría de la Solidaridad,
a Catholic Church effort to record human rights

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:08.750
violations. I also participated for a year
on an effort to collect pamphlets and underground

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:16.920
materials, a project conceived here in Princeton
by Professor Stanley Stein, his wife Barbara

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:20.092
and led then by bibliographer Peter Johnson.

00:10:20.092 --> 00:10:23.480
In what is called today the Ephemera Collection right next door

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:30.460
in Firestone Library, Princeton is the only
institution in the world to have documented

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:37.550
and preserved decades of struggles of people
whose lives were being shattered.

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:44.740
The consequences of a government based on
dishonesty in Chile were devastating: people

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:51.130
were desperately trying to decry human rights
violations; people were afraid to be visible,

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:57.490
but absolutely needing to denounce the atrocities
being committed.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:04.100
The greatest lesson I took from Chile is the
humanitarian cost that nations and people

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:14.060
pay when the lack of democratic consensus
leads to dangerous authoritarian governments.

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:24.400
Fast forward 32 years.&nbsp;An emerging and troublesome
climate of democracy and distrust seems to

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:32.181
be brewing right here in the United States.&nbsp;
It is a very simple concept: You cannot have

00:11:32.181 --> 00:11:39.170
a democratic form of government if citizens
distrust each other and if dishonesty is a

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:41.760
form of life.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:48.220
Believe me, what is happening is not good.&nbsp;
Political discourse is losing contact with

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:58.950
reality.&nbsp;When we let public speech be dominated
by discrimination, factionalism, fanaticism,

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:09.040
authoritarianism, demonizing the other, cult
of personality, religious intolerance … the

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:17.360
consequences are nefarious.&nbsp;As my father
learned firsthand in India; as so many of

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:27.640
our ancestors painfully learned, whether in
Weimar’s Germany, Mao’s China or Pinochet’s

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.300
Chile.

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:35.010
I don’t know about you, but I am starting
to hear too much of the same poisonous rhetoric

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:42.040
that lead in the past to heinous consequences.
This public discourse, based on so much information

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:47.300
that is simply not true, makes me question
whether government&nbsp;of&nbsp;the people,&nbsp;by&nbsp;the

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:57.070
people, and&nbsp;for&nbsp;the people may actually perish
if we don’t do something about it.

00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:05.780
I see it every day in my work in government.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Puerto Rico filed for bankruptcy in 2017,

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:11.650
and has been in an economic depression for
the past 12 years stemming from decades of

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:20.410
deceit and dishonesty by Wall Street and multiple
irresponsible fiscal and tax policy decisions

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:23.620
by both the government of the island and the
federal government in Washington,&nbsp;D.C.

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:30.440
We are now seeing the enormous consequences
of bond rating fabrications, ignoring experts’

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:38.210
warnings, and simply looking the other way
when serious, verifiable data was available.

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:45.190
Our citizens are now paying the price.&nbsp;Draconian
austerity measures are being imposed as we

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:52.250
speak, by the local government and an undemocratic
oversight board imposed by Congress.&nbsp;Hundreds

00:13:52.250 --> 00:14:00.510
of thousands have left the island.
The lesson is loud and clear: Lack of integrity

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:09.350
has serious consequences.
And then disaster struck. On September 20th,

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:17.420
2017, we were devastated by Maria, the most
powerful hurricane to make landfall over the

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:21.981
island in over 100 years. We did not have
energy or running water for months; there

00:14:21.981 --> 00:14:29.430
are some families still waiting.&nbsp;Up in the
mountains, children died of leptospirosis

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:35.730
after drinking contaminated water.&nbsp;The bureaucratic
response by federal and state authorities

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:43.810
was has been not only shameful but reprehensible
and immoral.&nbsp;Many people were left to survive

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:51.760
on their own.&nbsp;And mind you: Puerto Ricans
have been United States citizens for over

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:56.410
100 years. Some of us were frustrated and looking for

00:14:56.410 --> 00:15:02.790
ways to help.&nbsp;Without any knowledge of water
filtration or plumbing, we bought over one

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:07.839
hundred 500-gallon cisterns and thousands
of portable water filters, borrowed a few

00:15:07.839 --> 00:15:14.839
trucks, and spent three months installing them
in churches, community centers, and close to

00:15:14.839 --> 00:15:22.380
water springs.&nbsp;With our makeshift system,
we were able to produce over 350,000 bottles

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:29.709
of safe drinking water per day and save thousands
of people from potential life-threatening

00:15:29.709 --> 00:15:50.360
stomach viruses. Let me thank one of your
classmates, Diego Negrón-Reichard, who put

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:55.283
together a fundraiser last semester to help
finance this effort.

00:15:55.283 --> 00:15:58.590
¡GRACIAS DIEGO! Thank you very much, Diego.

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:04.860
The New York Times reported back in November
that&nbsp;instead of pledging support for a large-scale

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:14.550
emergency relief plan, President Trump declared
that Hurricane Maria was not a “real catastrophe”

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:23.750
and complained that the storm had, and I quote,
“thrown our budget a little out of whack.”

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:27.980
He announced in San Juan that the official
death toll from the hurricane, allegedly 16

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:35.500
at the time, was the true measure of the government’s
response. “We saved a lot of lives,” he

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:42.370
boasted, and then flew back home.&nbsp;It was
his way to scale back on emergency federal

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:51.800
help and minimize the magnitude of the crisis.&nbsp;
That was&nbsp;after tossing around paper towels

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:57.970
during his visit to the island.&nbsp;&nbsp;
To this day the official death toll by the

00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:06.860
government of Puerto Rico is 64 deaths.&nbsp;
Then truth kicked in just this past week:

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:13.720
The New England Journal of Medicine published
a shocking report last Tuesday by Harvard’s

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:23.040
School of Public Health.&nbsp;It estimates that
4,645 people died after Hurricane Maria.

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:29.230
The newly released study was conducted without
the collaboration of Puerto Rico’s government,

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:38.190
which the researchers said refused to provide
data to them.&nbsp;A real catastrophe indeed

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:44.940
that stems from government inaction, lying
to the people, posturing, and being blind

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:57.170
to reality: all symptoms of “alternative
facts” and botched data by the governments

00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:06.350
of Puerto Rico and the United States.&nbsp;
Again, lack of integrity has real life consequences.

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:11.559
So, what are we supposed to do?

00:18:11.559 --> 00:18:17.830
In such an environment, we need to wake up
and confront the culture of lies. There is

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:24.860
no time to waste. The voices of reason,
of honor, integrity, and honesty need to be

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:30.570
heard.&nbsp;I know it is not easy.&nbsp;
I returned to work

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:37.840
in Puerto Rico convinced that state and local
governments are the real laboratories of democracy.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:43.940
What I saw shocked me. Our public schools,
where all poor children attend, for example,

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:49.330
have one of the worst achievement performances
in the United States.&nbsp;There are not enough

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:55.560
books in the classrooms; thousands of teachers
and students skip school every day. And

00:18:55.560 --> 00:19:04.111
no one said a thing!&nbsp;The government and
the elite simply looked the other way.&nbsp;I

00:19:04.111 --> 00:19:10.460
have been pushing for radical reforms. To
me, perpetuating poverty on the children of

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:16.520
the Island is not an option.
On the other hand, I have taken on the task

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:22.889
to condemn the culture at the electric utility,
the most inefficient, financially bankrupt

00:19:22.889 --> 00:19:29.600
and expensive energy generation and distribution
monopoly.&nbsp;Electricity is vital for progress

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:38.830
in the 21st century. Just think how much sun
we have on the island! And yet, 98% of our

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:49.129
generation comes from burning fossil fuels;
less than 1% is solar.&nbsp;We are hostages of

00:19:49.129 --> 00:19:54.389
an oil cartel of sorts. And yet, for decades
the political leadership and the government

00:19:54.389 --> 00:20:00.450
of the island knew it but tolerated and even
celebrated this culture of dishonesty and

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:09.389
deceit.&nbsp;In both cases, 
by saying enough is enough

00:20:09.389 --> 00:20:18.260
I have had to confront very angry interest
groups.&nbsp;From the left and the right; conservatives

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:26.040
and liberals.&nbsp;The world of false stories
and alternative facts is not confined to one

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:32.389
ideology.&nbsp;In this climate of 
confusion, misinformation,

00:20:32.389 --> 00:20:40.610
and lies, nothing is more powerful than the
inconvenient truth of real facts, the strength

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:47.859
of honor and the persistent sound of our voices.&nbsp;
But let me warn you: It can get very lonely

00:20:47.859 --> 00:20:55.510
out there in the wild forest of righting wrongs,
and instilling honesty in public service.

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:59.619
So, graduating seniors, 
how can you live up

00:20:59.619 --> 00:21:07.639
to the standard of Princeton in the Nation’s Service? 
My clear invitation is to fight the

00:21:07.639 --> 00:21:15.480
alternative facts disease wherever you are,
wherever you go, before it is too late.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:24.990
Like the Honor Code created by students 125
years ago, you need to follow three mantras:

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:32.889
First, democracy needs from you a commitment
to personal integrity.&nbsp;Verify the sources

00:21:32.889 --> 00:21:39.759
of information, ask the hard questions, and
educate others to do so. You have had the

00:21:39.759 --> 00:21:47.190
best education in the world, and your generation
has more access to technology and social media

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:55.270
than any other before you.&nbsp;That comes with
a responsibility to spread the truth.

00:21:55.270 --> 00:22:03.309
Second, you need to be brave and hold everyone
else to your high standards.&nbsp;SPEAK UP PEOPLE,

00:22:03.309 --> 00:22:09.970
SPEAK UP,  you have the tools to have a voice
more powerful than any other generation.

00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:20.260
And finally, you need to act and act quickly.&nbsp;
As Woodrow Wilson once said, “Life does

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:30.970
not consist in thinking; it consists in acting.”
Look around America today.&nbsp;There are fighters

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:35.889
out there confronting the culture of lies
and alternative facts; telling the truth and

00:22:35.889 --> 00:22:42.470
reporting violations of vital principles and
values, just like Martin Luther King and other

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:49.649
leaders of the civil rights movement did in
the 1960s. Choose your cause and make

00:22:49.649 --> 00:23:00.639
your honest argument.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
Today, I salute the Black Lives Matter movement.

00:23:00.639 --> 00:23:20.879
I salute the women all over the United States
in the #MeToo movement.

00:23:20.879 --> 00:23:27.129
I salute the students at Santa Fe High School
in Texas; the Sandy Hook Elementary School

00:23:27.129 --> 00:23:34.059
in Connecticut; the Marjory Stoneman Douglas
High School in Florida, and so many others

00:23:34.059 --> 00:23:48.389
who have been victims not only of senseless
school shootings but of senseless gun legislation.

00:23:48.389 --> 00:23:59.279
I salute&nbsp;President Eisgruber and Harvard
President Drew Faust who two weeks ago urged

00:23:59.279 --> 00:24:07.240
Congress to stop absurd deportations and provide
legal status for people from El Salvador,

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:26.999
Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, and Sudan.
I also salute the thousands of excellent Latino

00:24:26.999 --> 00:24:38.239
students in our colleges and universities
fighting not to be deported, targets of the

00:24:38.239 --> 00:25:01.470
culture of prejudice.
But allow me also to salute my people of Puerto

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:08.739
Rico.&nbsp;Against all odds, Puerto Ricans are
up, fighting, resilient with a sense of purpose

00:25:08.739 --> 00:25:14.950
in finding opportunity amidst the crisis,
with their hearts filled with hope and a renewed

00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:25.399
commitment to rebuild our island.
All these brave men and women are saying enough

00:25:25.399 --> 00:25:34.890
is enough with this culture of hostility,
of confrontation and intimidation.&nbsp;And yes,

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:42.899
of lies.&nbsp;Put all of this together 
and it feels like

00:25:42.899 --> 00:25:52.799
1893 again.
But this time around, YOU are the senior class.

00:25:52.799 --> 00:25:59.850
We urgently need you to foster a National
Honor Code to stop this “alternative facts”

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:05.850
disease that is weakening democracy.&nbsp;
My hope is that at the Baccalaureate ceremony

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:18.830
125 years from now - in the year 2143 - 
they will celebrate the great Class of 2018 whose

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:25.240
members had the vision and the courage to
take the moral leadership to do what was right

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:29.960
for the world.
El silencio no es opcion.

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:39.159
Silence is not an option. Class of 2018, denounce
what needs to be denounced; fix what is broken;

00:26:39.159 --> 00:26:46.859
right what is wrong; and do not allow anyone,
regardless of their agenda, to use false data

00:26:46.859 --> 00:26:54.309
and pretenses to confuse citizens and weaken
democracy.&nbsp;Be the vital voices to restore

00:26:54.309 --> 00:27:05.060
democratic principles.&nbsp;Don’t look elsewhere.&nbsp;
It is you: the great Class of 2018! Speak

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:07.299
up, seniors, speak up!&nbsp;¡Hablen, seniors,
hablen!

00:27:07.299 --> 00:27:13.269
Show the world what having honor is about,
what an honor code is, and how it works.

00:27:13.269 --> 00:27:20.279
You must become the generation to restore
honor in America and the world.

00:27:20.279 --> 00:27:28.989
There is nothing more honorable than making
people have hope in democracy again.

00:27:28.989 --> 00:27:40.239
You have the honor; go live it; go teach it;
go act on it.

00:27:40.239 --> 00:27:40.739
Thank you very much. Muchas gracias.
