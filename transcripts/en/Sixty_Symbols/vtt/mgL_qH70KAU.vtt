00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:04.259
Regularly once a month or so I've had an email saying "Have you come across gauge blocks?

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.399
Do you know what gauge blocks are? You know they stick together? How do they stick together?

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:15.599
Do they do..what's going on there? Is it due to a vacuum? Is it due to grease? Is it due to something else?"

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.100
(Brady) So, so Phil what are gauge blocks? I don't even know you talking about.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.800
Great, so I had very little knowledge of what a gauge block was until actually this morning. When I did, I decided

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.320
I'd finally take a look, and go down to the workshop and talk to our wonderfully talented technicians.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.020
And they have got a number of boxes of these gauge blocks.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.450
So these are like measurement standards. Very precisely machined to be a certain number of millimeters.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.579
So the surfaces are incredibly smooth, incredibly flat. Machined to be really, really flat and

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:51.869
what you can do is you can take two gauge blocks and just by pushing them together get them stick. No glue, no

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.800
jiggery-pokery, no magnetism. They'll just stick. (Brady) And what are they made of?

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.180
Just pure steel, which seems quite magical and so I want to try and attempt to do this.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.699
It's a bit of a skill sometimes it seems to work sometimes it seems to not work.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.290
I am sure the Brady has ever will leave in all the attempts that don't work.

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.969
But let's let's see. What I'm going to do first of all is just just put a little bit of acetone on

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.179
And clean off any crud that's on

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.619
On the smooth face. That's relatively clean now, and let's clean this one off. (Brady) You're drying it so there's no acetone left?

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.519
No, there's no acetone left now. I'm using the acetone to just take off any crud that's on there.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.320
No, I don't think this is gonna work that time. No that time didn't.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.309
No! So the way you're meant to do it is actually twist around to 90 degrees, but I've never

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.810
nearly!

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.810
I think I can get that to work this right before. There we . . .[expletive]

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.287
We'll just clean it again.

00:01:48.287 --> 00:01:50.456
(Brady) Technicians know of the trick?

00:01:50.456 --> 00:01:52.740
Yeah, no technicians use it all the time

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.270
It's not just a trick, it's

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.820
a way of stacking them up. And the reason why

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.679
it was introduced like this is because they didn't want to have a whole set of different calibration gauges

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.969
and this makes it much more straightforward to just add them up--if you can get it a bloody work!

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.050
Almost . . .

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.910
there we go! (Brady) Keep still! Keep still for me.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:24.079
(Brady) So they're like stuck there, Phil? (Phil) They're stuck together, yep, and you know, force of gravity doesn't care. So that's you know,

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.199
it's a fairly hefty block and it's being held on there against the force of gravity. [Laughter]

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:38.660
What makes it happen? So that's been a question now people have--I'm getting quite okay with it now--

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.380
That's a question that people have asked a lot, an awful

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.519
lot over the last century, a 120 years or something like that, as to what the heck is going on.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.730
So it's an effect that you see

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:49.620
when you have very smooth surfaces. Now, it just doesn't have to be steel.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.149
Over here

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.590
I've got a couple of silicon wafers. These are very smooth as well, and what I'm going to do is

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.399
I'm going to put one on top of the other and apply a bit of pressure,

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.040
hopefully without cracking that.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.010
Here we go.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.170
Okay same idea.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.170
(Brady) What's going on there? Two very smooth surfaces?

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.450
(Phil) Two very smooth surfaces. So there are number of different things. First of all, everything around us to a greater or lesser extent is covered

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:18.660
with a thin film of water.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:19.980
Depends on how

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.459
hydrophobic--how much it doesn't like water--or hydrophilic a surface is. To a certain extent all

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.010
surfaces were covered with a molecularly thin film of water.

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.529
So that's one aspect of this on a molecular level that acts as a sort of glue, but even beyond that what's remarkable,

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.670
great

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.619
aspect of, how will we put it--the statistics of quantum physics in action.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:47.000
But in this case the silicon wafers for example have got a thin film of oxide that's relatively hydrophilic. It likes water.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.530
Similarly with the metal here,

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.369
relatively hydrophilic, quite likes water. However in the case of the silicon, what you can do is you can take a silicon wafer,

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.189
dip it into hydroflouric acid,

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.320
strip off all the oxide, and end up with a very hydrophobic surface, so as soon as you put water on it,

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.800
it beads up.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.559
Those will still bond. And the reason they still bond, and these will still bond in vacuum even when you remove the water, the

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.060
reason they still bond is over here you've got fluctuating electrons, over here

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:20.299
you've got fluctuating electrons, and it's something called the van der Waals effect. In any given instance of time, there's a little dipole.

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.119
There's a little imbalance of charge so that you've got a region

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.460
which is slightly more positive compared to another region.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:32.840
And those dipoles interact and snap things together so a whole area in the semiconductor industry called wafer bonding based on this.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:40.579
(Brady) It's not like one's positive and one's negative? (Phil) No, no, absolutely not. It's exactly the same effect happens in atoms.  So xenon,

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.090
for example,

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.159
you can condense that to form a xenon solid, and that's not because electrons are being shared,

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.970
or electrons are being transferred as in a covalent or an ionic bond. What's happening is it's this van der Waals effect.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.480
It's, it's because there are fluctuations of the electrons, which

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.499
means that it's not like you've added a positive charge. It means that if the

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.450
fluctuations of electrons then this bit slightly got more electrons over here than it is over here,

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.549
so there's a tiny, tiny dipole. And it's those dipoles that give rise to this, this force.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:17.180
Even though there's no transfer of charge, even though there's no sharing of electrons,

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.199
it isn't an ionic bond. It isn't a covalent bond. It's called the van der Waals force.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.790
It's exceptionally important.

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:28.939
And that's what's certainly a contributor alongside any liquid film that might be there to what's holding these things together.

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.990
So you might be wondering why doesn't it sort of work in the opposite direction as well?

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.085
Why doesn't it correlate so that they just fly apart in terms of the way the charges line up?

00:05:38.085 --> 00:05:44.330
So a key thing that can happen is that the dipole that forms here, on that instant moment of time, it can induce, it can

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:50.840
influence the electrons over here and includes them in such a way so that the net attraction that that happens there.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.829
(Brady) Why did the surface have to be so smooth? Why don't you and I stick to each other?

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:01.099
(Phil) So that's a really good question. So you need those smooth because you want those--if you have asperities there, if you have sharp bits,

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.309
then what happens is your forces don't add up in the right way.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.780
You don't get the interactions. Moreover, if the liquid film is important, the fact that you've got a

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:14.090
very rough surface means that that water film that liquid film can't act as a glue in the same way.

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:17.990
In some state called an entangled state

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.310
That's all we need to go into you

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:24.650
Send one particle to one end of the universe if the universes ends the other particle to the other end of the universe you make

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:31.340
A measurement on this one and here's the weird bit the bit, but course causes so many physicists so many sleepless night
