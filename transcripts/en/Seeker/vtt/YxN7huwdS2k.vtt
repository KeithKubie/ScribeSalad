00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.530
As a poet once said, "Oh, what a feeling,
when we're dancing on the ceiling," What about

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:05.530
spiders?

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.740
I don't want them on my ceiling, and how did
they get up there?!

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:16.360
Hey stickers, this is Trace, thanks for tuning
in for some DNews.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.370
A new study in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, found humans could never

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.570
be amazing like spiderman, we're too big!

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.720
We'd need to cover 40 percent of our whole
body with sticky pads to be able to climb

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.880
walls like a gecko or web-slinging spider,
but that got me thinking, how exactly do all

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.340
those critters do it?

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.750
How geckos cling to walls was a huge scientific
debate for millennia, until a 2002 study also

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.610
published in PNAS finally found the truth:
it's not sticky mucus, suction, or velcro

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:50.600
hooks, but something else entirely that keeps
them on the walls: molecular interaction.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.850
By testing geckos on various surfaces, the
researchers realized geckos could cling to

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.790
materials that are polar.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.210
Not polar like cold, but polar as in electromagnetism.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.970
Van der waals forces are molecular-level interactions
first recognized in 1930.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.810
The forces are described by quantum mechanics
and involve the electrodynamic interaction

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.810
of molecules.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.740
Basically: all atoms have charges....some
are positively charged, while others are negative.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.500
And atoms with opposite charges attract.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.220
The researchers found the millions of little
hairs on some gekkan feet -- called setae

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.909
-- create a weak attraction with surfaces
whose atoms have that opposing charge.

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.580
Some gekkan setae create enough attraction
that they can can hold up to 100 times their

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.580
weight!

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.580
So in other words, itâ€™s not about chemistry
or the amount of some miracle sticky adhesive,

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.490
it's just about the physics of those little
hairs and a particular surface.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.759
An idea this good can't just be kept to a
small group of geckos.

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.280
Convergent evolution is when nature evolves
astonishingly similar ways to solve the same

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.590
problem in different species, and one of the
prey of geckos got this bonus too.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.549
Spiders independently evolved setae, but theirs
take the form of protrusions on their exoskeletons.

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.159
These protrusions allow them to take advantage
of van der waals attraction too!

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.130
Thanks to their adaptations, spiders generate
three to four times their body weight in surface

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.770
force, allowing for them to quickly jump,
attack, move, or carry their own prey.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.810
The problem is, the larger something is, the
less able they are of taking advantage of

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:19.990
van der waals forces.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.200
Tree frogs, for example, need mucus to stick
to things.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.200
Also gross.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.880
And according to that original new PNAS study,
humans are just too big to use microscopic

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:30.880
hairs.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.330
That being said, engineers are using millions
and millions of synthetic tiny hairs to create

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.840
reusable adhesive that can come unstuck again
and again!

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.520
Unfortunately, nature is still besting us,
a 2013 attempt published in Smart Materials

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.580
and Structures was only 35 percent as effective
as the strongest gecko toes.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.580
SOMEDAY THOUGH.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.580
Someday.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.490
Guys, Amy and I are now on your TV box!

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.249
It's like a computer, but it's bigger and
sits in the living room.

00:02:56.249 --> 00:03:00.090
