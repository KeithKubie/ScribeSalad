ALEXEY KOKIN: My name is Alexey.

00:00:01.423 --> 00:00:03.870
I'm with Google Play Business
Development for Application

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.460
in Central and Eastern Europe.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.585
RICCARDO GOVONI: And I'm
Riccardo, Engineering Lead

00:00:07.585 --> 00:00:08.437
on Android Vitals.

00:00:08.437 --> 00:00:10.020
ALEXEY KOKIN: And
we are going to talk

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.080
with you about application
quality in Android.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.420
Application quality
in Android has always

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.620
been a top priority for us.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.620
And we have been moving
away from just installations

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.880
and user rights in Play
application and start

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.290
focusing on more complex
and exact metrics,

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.640
like engagement and
[INAUDIBLE] performance.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.100
Today, we are going to talk
about this all in detail.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.050
First of all, why it's
important to have a quality app.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.550
Then, how can you troubleshoot
your technical issues

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.200
and master Android vitals?

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.330
And how you can build
an excellent product

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.840
on this great
technical foundation.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.450
First of all, why
quality matters.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.290
Why it's important?

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.000
Quality directly
impacts the success

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.620
of your business on Google Play.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.650
We have run an analysis
on our top apps and games

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.830
in Google Play ranking
their quality score.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.590
And we have seen some
spectacular results.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.840
For example, when application
moved from average

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.730
to good quality, we can
see up to seven time uplift

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.460
in retention and six time uplift
in spend in those applications.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.170
Our partners support
those findings.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.750
For example, Zalando, Europe's
leading fashion platform,

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.200
they focused on reliability
and performance,

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.080
eliminating bugs and making
their application faster.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.290
And this has not only
increased the organic traffic

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.200
they're getting.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.060
It provided the positive
impact on their revenue growth

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.260
in the LTV lifetime
value per user.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.120
How much stability matters?

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.970
The answer is it matters a lot.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.970
Again, our findings found out
that if the application crashes

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.730
a lot-- and "a lot" means
more than 5% crashes,

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.650
they have a 30% more
uninstallation in the first day

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.660
than more stable apps.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.480
You have seen this previously.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.030
But again, I want to remind you
that application performance

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.620
and quality is the main
driver of your user rankings.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.990
60% of negative reviews
mention stability and crash.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.940
And 60% of positive reviews
mentioning speed, design,

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:05.800
and reliability.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.210
You know what to focus on
to make your app excellent.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.290
Again, our partners
support those findings.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.260
Busuu, a language learning app,
they saw significant growth

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.360
in their average ranking when
they increase the performance

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.400
of the applications.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.560
And everybody
knows how difficult

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.960
it is to grow the application
from already higher ranking

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.270
for 4.1.

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.830
Lastly, in addition to
those objective reactions

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.220
and your business goals,
there are some rewards

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.930
you can get from
Google Play from having

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.510
quality applications.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.710
Those benefits are the
boost of organic traffic,

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.485
featuring, and some occasional
awards you can get from us.

00:02:43.485 --> 00:02:45.590
For example, if the
application crashes a lot,

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.570
it gets a lot of negative
reviews and bad user ratings.

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.440
it can decrease your application
promotability in Google Play.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.950
And when there's picking an
application for featuring,

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.200
we have already paid
a lot of attention

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.450
to its overall quality
and platform support.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.450
Now, we are starting to
look at your Android vitals

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.780
to see if the apps actually
performs and works stable.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.300
And at the end of the
day, you can get a lot

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.150
of specific Google awards.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.770
We sometime run some
kind of best application

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.420
of the year or
material design award,

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.210
which can do wonders for your
PR and promote your application.

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.500
One such award is
Android Excellence,

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.690
which we have announced
on Google I/O,

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.210
and which we have updated
two times already.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.890
It's a quarterly collection
of our best content, best apps

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.820
and games the Android
system has to offer.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.270
And this is some top
and great applications

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.110
you can look for inspiration
and some great ideas

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.580
on how to build
Android applications.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.545
Now, to the
technical excellence.

00:03:53.545 --> 00:03:54.670
RICCARDO GOVONI: Thank you.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.480
So you heard from Kobe in the
keynote about Android Vitals.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.380
I want to spend 10
minutes walking you

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.230
through how it can help you.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.700
What is Android Vitals?

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.830
Android Vitals is a
program that Google

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.350
create to help you create apps
and games of exemplary quality.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.830
We launched it at Google I/O
with Android Vitals dashboard

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.240
in the Play Console.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.209
In there, you can see aggregated
performance information

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.560
about your app.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.720
Data is collected
automatically, no action

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.840
required from you, from
millions of devices worldwide,

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.120
from any user that has agreed
to share data with Google.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.530
For example, when they
unbox their new device.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.640
Thanks to this, everyone
in your companies,

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.940
from engineers all
the way to the CEO,

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.970
can understand app quality
and set KPIs around it.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.040
How does Android Vitals work?

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.660
It's a combination
of three things--

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.960
metrics, tools, and rewards.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.010
Metrics.

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.080
I mean, bad behaviors.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.560
These are application practices
and patterns and events

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.780
that are detrimental
to the user experience,

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.510
like crashes and battery
drains, all the things

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.430
that you want to avoid.

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.880
Tools in Play Console to help
you understand and improve

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.010
your app quality
from before release

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.740
with the pre-launch report,
at release time with Release

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.420
Dashboard, and
after release when

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.140
your app is live with the
Android Vitals Dashboard.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.630
And finally, rewards.

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.540
As Alexey mentioned, rewards in
search and discovery for apps

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.050
that show exemplary behavior.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.770
What I mean by "bad behaviors?"

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.580
If you go to Android
Vitals today,

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.880
so far you will see that
we explain performance

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.250
across three key domains--

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.550
stability, battery,
and rendering.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.760
For stability, we tell you
whenever your application

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.470
is crushing or freezing.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.480
Application not responding.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.670
For battery, we
already inform you

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.760
when your application is causing
unnecessary battery drains.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.580
For example, by keeping
the CPU on excessively

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.180
or for too long amount of time,
or waking the device up too

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.110
often.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.950
And for rendering, we highlight
whenever the application

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.450
is slow, slower than
60 frame per second,

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.140
or stuttering with
frozen frames.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.220
We've seen massive
momentum since we launched

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:16.350
at Google I/O. Over 65% of
Play top apps are engaging

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:19.380
with Android Vitals
regularly, over 60,000 app

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.730
developers worldwide.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:25.380
And by working closely with
over 50 partners, some of you

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.050
in the audience as
well, we observed

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.690
that they were able, on
average, to reduce their crash

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:35.770
rate from 3.5% down to
1.7%, which is massive.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.210
And this means that
since Google I/O,

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:43.620
over 1.5 billion installations
were delivered to users,

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:49.130
leading them to apps that
are better and less crashing.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.530
Thanks to these,
for many partners,

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.560
Android Vitals is now an
active part of their planning.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.830
And they observe a direct
impact on customer satisfaction

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.940
by focusing on app quality,
like the Weather Channel here.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.610
So inspired by all
of this, I want

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.470
to announce three
new things today--

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.530
expanded device coverage,
five additional new metrics

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.270
to help you understand
and act on app

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.990
quality, and a completely
new user experience

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.570
in the Play Console.

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.120
First, expanded device coverage.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.170
Until now, Android Vitals only
reported performance pertaining

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:25.960
to Nexus and Pixel devices.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.660
In the last three months,
we worked with several OEMs

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:32.650
to surface performance
metrics for many new devices,

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.650
across the spectrum from
high-end flagship devices,

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:39.490
to mid-range bestsellers,
to low-end devices.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:42.370
And this means that
we are able to cover

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:45.640
over 50 times more
amount of sessions

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.090
tracked by the program.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:50.230
So if until now you
were not able to get

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:53.110
sufficient representative
information in Android Vitals,

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.180
I encourage you to
go and check it today

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.540
because it's going
to be much better.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:01.270
We increased the set of
metrics that we report,

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:05.300
starting with additional metrics
around stability and battery.

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.970
For stability, obviously,
repeating crashes

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:11.240
induce user frustration
because the apps

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:15.440
appears irremediably broken and
this leads to high uninstalls.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.220
So now you can see
additional new metrics

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:21.400
around multi-ANRs,
percentage of sessions

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:25.510
during which users experience
more than one freeze

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:26.650
during a session.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:30.270
And the same for crashes.

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:34.020
On battery, we focused on
excessive background activity.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:37.169
Excessive background activity
consumes unnecessary battery

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:39.419
when the user is
away from the phone.

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:42.179
And your app will not receive
much usage if the phone is dead

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:44.020
when the user comes back to it.

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:45.720
And so we have three
new metrics there.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:49.320
One is excessive Wi-Fi
scans in the background.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.000
Whenever the apps
perform too many

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.540
Wi-Fi scans when
not in active use.

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:56.490
Same is for excessive
network usage.

00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:00.690
You will be able to see whenever
your application is consuming

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:04.440
an excessive amount of
data and network usage

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.220
while the app is not in active
use, and stuck background wake

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:10.710
locks, the percentage
of sessions

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:15.480
when the app was keeping the
CPU on for more than one hour

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.710
while it was in the
background, not in active use.

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:21.500
To help you with
all of this, we also

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.410
significantly revamped the
Play Console user experience

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:26.240
to help you understand,
improve your app

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.910
quality in easier ways.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:31.690
There is a new
Overview page that

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:33.470
helps you understand
your overall app

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:36.920
quality at a glance across
all performance metrics.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:37.970
This is live now.

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:39.470
You can go and
check it out as soon

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:42.690
as you're out of this session.

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:44.150
There is a new--

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:46.940
straight at the top of the
page in the highlighted section

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.359
that points out
any bad behaviors

00:09:48.359 --> 00:09:50.150
that are triggering
for your app right now.

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:55.070
So you can immediately focus
on the most important actions.

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:57.080
You can now track the
performance of your app

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:00.650
over time and see
whenever you improve

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:03.650
or you regress on your
application quality.

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:05.259
And observe the
impact of the actions

00:10:05.259 --> 00:10:06.300
that you took to improve.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.140
To facilitate recursion
for any bad behaviors that

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.000
might trigger, your
can now slice the data

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.080
by any combination of version
code, devices, OS version,

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.500
time, to really dive into,
what are the main problems that

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.560
may be affecting your app?

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.124
And to help you understand
the opportunity even further,

00:10:27.124 --> 00:10:29.540
you have now benchmarks that
help your establish reference

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:30.350
points.

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:34.490
How your behavior fares
against the top 10,000 apps.

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:36.860
And we highlight what
is the performance

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:38.720
of the bottom
quartile, so you can

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.550
see what the opportunity
for improvement

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:44.960
is for your app to
capture compared to peers.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.740
And finally, we want to
help you take action and be

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:51.570
guided into recovery
whenever there is a problem.

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:54.580
So for example, in the case
of application freezes, which

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.080
are sometimes hard to debug
because multiple causes

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.530
contribute to them, we
now highlight what cause

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:03.410
led to them across
many different reasons,

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:06.650
from deadlocks, to excessive
disk I/O, to excessive network

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:09.860
I/O, excessive database
usage, suspended triads

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.920
due to garbage collection,
and much more, straight

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:16.210
from the Play Console UI.

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:18.949
So thanks to these, partners
are using Vitals more and more

00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:20.490
to continue investing
in app quality.

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:23.070
And it's great to see feedback
like these from Big Fish

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:26.700
Games around specific features
like the effectiveness

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.520
of benchmarks.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:34.110
I want to cover one more thing
around pre-launch report.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.000
Pre-launch report
is Play solution

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.960
for automated app testing
before production releases.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:44.130
It automatically crawls APKs
on 10 physical devices looking

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:46.890
for crashes and security
vulnerabilities.

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:50.130
And what we observe is that,
in 90% of the time, whenever

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:52.860
pre-launch report
discovers a crash,

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.060
the app was then not
pushed to production.

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:57.000
So very effective
in preventing bad

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.430
experiences reaching your users.

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:01.500
Three big news for these today.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.170
First, no more need to
opt-in into the service.

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:06.090
This was the case until now.

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:09.150
Every APK that is going
to be now from today

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:11.460
submitted to alpha
or to beta track

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:14.096
will automatically be
tested by pre-launch report.

00:12:14.096 --> 00:12:16.470
So for many of you, you will
now start seeing the results

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:18.960
without any opt-in to do.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.670
We completely
rewrote and improved

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:23.340
the automated crawler
that navigates your app

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:26.070
to understand better
the content of your app

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:28.410
and reach deeper into that
with increased coverage

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:30.910
and be more effective
at detecting

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:32.820
crashes that would
have otherwise reached

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.980
users in production.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:38.040
And the last one, we launched
an entire new section

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.840
centered on performance
metrics that

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.760
are collected during the crawl.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.650
So as the robot
explores your app,

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:46.530
you will now then be able to
replay what the crawler did.

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:48.540
And next to the video
for what the crawler did,

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:52.540
you will see performance metric
around CPU, memory, network,

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:53.340
and rendering.

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:56.040
So you can understand if
specific actions in your app

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:59.570
are particularly troublesome.

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:02.480
All of these, I hope,
will help you leading you

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.710
to a healthy app.

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:05.920
But then, how do you
make it memorable?

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.570
And how do you
make it excellent?

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:09.545
And for this, I will
lead back to Alexey.

00:13:11.972 --> 00:13:12.680
ALEXEY KOKIN: OK.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.260
So Android Vitals,
hopefully, has

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.329
helped you to build
a great application

00:13:17.329 --> 00:13:18.620
from the technical perspective.

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:19.480
It works stable.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.310
It works fast.

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:21.460
It works smooth.

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:22.850
And there is no issues.

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:24.930
How do you go up from that?

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:27.800
And how do you build
an excellent product?

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:28.890
What is the next step?

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:33.800
The next step is
building useful products

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.050
from our useful
features the users love,

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:42.300
from using beautiful design and
using all Android platform can

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:42.860
offer you.

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:46.410
Let's talk about this in
a little bit more detail.

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:47.850
First of all, material design.

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:50.030
As a concept, got
a lot of praise

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:54.400
from independent developers
and independent designers.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.240
There are a lot
of material about,

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.620
how can you implement
and adopt material

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:00.500
design in your
applications, most

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.905
from Google and
from our partners.

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.060
Remember that just [INAUDIBLE]
pre-made components.

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:09.560
We have plenty of them.

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.450
It does not make your
application material.

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:13.790
You should think material
and design your application

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:17.800
from the ground up, keeping
the main concept in mind.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.234
And having you up in
material design definitely

00:14:20.234 --> 00:14:21.150
helps your engagement.

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:23.380
Because users on
Android, they are

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:28.010
used to the common approaches
and common elements of material

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:29.240
design.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.830
Next step is the
platform support.

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:32.820
A quality app is an
up-to-date application.

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.360
We encourage you to
use the latest SDK

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:38.240
and support the latest version
of Android operating system.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.160
And as soon as there
is a new developer

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.890
preview of a next
version, or as soon

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:45.290
as there's a better
version of next Android

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:48.980
build, try and test your
application against it

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.170
to be ready for its release.

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:53.650
Of course, there are a
lot of different platforms

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:55.640
we've actually built on
Android and supporting

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.784
them will improve your
application quality.

00:14:57.784 --> 00:14:59.450
And there are some
cross-platform tools,

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:02.120
for example, like sign in with
Google and Smart Lock which

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:07.940
help your users to create their
accounts or log in seamlessly.

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.680
Speaking about the
relevant platforms,

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.550
there are plenty of devices
running Android out there.

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:18.560
Wearable, tablets, smart TVs,
VR devices, and connected cars.

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.841
Not everything is relevant for
each your application's user

00:15:21.841 --> 00:15:22.340
case.

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:23.881
But when it's
relevant, it definitely

00:15:23.881 --> 00:15:26.150
help boost your
application quality

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:30.020
and benefit from
supporting those platforms.

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:32.110
Monetization with
Google Play billing

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:35.120
is another great example
of how your application can

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.240
increase the quality.

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.790
If the users love
your app so much,

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:40.460
they're ready to pay for your
content and for your services,

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:44.310
it's definitely a sign
of a quality application.

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:47.992
Either premium content, in-app
purchases, or subscriptions.

00:15:47.992 --> 00:15:49.700
After you go through
a certain threshold,

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.320
we will consider
your application

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.820
as a more quality app.

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:54.660
Of course, there is
also Android Pay,

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:56.660
which is launched in many
regions across Europe.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:57.920
Not Germany, of course.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:00.110
But for example, in
Poland and Russia,

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:01.700
Android Pay is up and running.

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:05.000
And our partner reports
that they can get up to 20%

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.820
more playing users for their
services with Android Pay.

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:11.416
So support it and enjoy
additional revenue

00:16:11.416 --> 00:16:14.520
and additional users.

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:19.180
Moving on from the application
itself to the Play listing.

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:23.030
This is the most important
thing for your organic traffic

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:24.406
and conversion to install.

00:16:24.406 --> 00:16:26.030
There are a lot of
Play distinct tools,

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:28.510
which of course,
most of you already

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:32.180
knew and use, which include
promo videos, A/B testing,

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:35.720
and [INAUDIBLE] which help you
deliver quality applications

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.170
to your users.

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:39.590
You can also use
the Play Console

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:45.290
to respond to user reviews
in their native tongue,

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:49.490
helping resolve their issues and
boost your application rating,

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:51.230
keeping it about 4.

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:54.010
When your rating
is about 4 points,

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:56.120
it generally is
the main threshold

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:59.530
we need to put your app in some
kind of promos featuring them

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:00.440
as activities.

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:06.660
And of course, all
of those experiments

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:10.089
with the play listing help
with your conversions.

00:17:10.089 --> 00:17:13.099
And our partners definitely
support those findings.

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:15.170
So if you experiment
with your screenshot,

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:20.780
with your description and
other parts of your listing,

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:23.440
it can boost your conversion.

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:27.400
For example, Wallapop, they
increased the conversion by 17%

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.710
by testing short
descriptions [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:32.350
and the screenshot orders.

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:35.500
For the best results
of such testing,

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.020
you definitely should
have a clear hypothesis

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:41.070
and some big design variations,
because only those activities

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:45.290
help you get variable,
great results.

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:49.300
So to sum everything up.

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:50.890
First of all, your
application quality

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:53.290
directly affects your
business success and customer

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:54.667
satisfaction.

00:17:54.667 --> 00:17:57.250
RICCARDO GOVONI: And then, as I
mentioned with Android Vitals,

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:58.910
you can understand
and troubleshoot

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:03.040
your technical issues to lead to
an excellent app, from expanded
