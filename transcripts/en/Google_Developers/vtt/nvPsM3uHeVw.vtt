JONAH JONES: Imagine you're
sitting in a cafe with a friend

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:04.461
and they draw you, on
the back of a napkin,

00:00:04.461 --> 00:00:05.600
how to get to their house.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.558
They're not going to draw
you every single road

00:00:07.558 --> 00:00:09.560
and every single business
that's on the way.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.185
They're going to
simplify this for you.

00:00:11.185 --> 00:00:13.827
We wanted to emphasize
those things on Google Maps.

00:00:13.827 --> 00:00:16.035
It's almost like having a
cartographer in your pocket

00:00:16.035 --> 00:00:16.535
now.

00:00:16.535 --> 00:00:19.890
Because we can, now, rebuild
the perfect map for every place

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.374
and for every person.

00:00:21.374 --> 00:00:23.040
We've never been able
to do this before.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.225
SIAN TOWNSEND: I'm interested
if someone likes Google Maps.

00:00:30.225 --> 00:00:32.570
But what matters
so much more is,

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.026
can they actually
use Google Maps?

00:00:35.026 --> 00:00:37.400
JONAH JONES: The research can
provide these deep insights

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.289
into how real people
are using the products.

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:41.580
Put this in front of real
people and watch them use it.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.210
And see if they're struggling,
or if things are working well.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.168
SIAN TOWNSEND: One thing
we noticed in research

00:00:46.168 --> 00:00:48.330
was that, some people
had problems navigating

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.480
street view, which was kind
of disappointing to us,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.420
because that's really
where all the fun is,

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.430
being able to explore.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.640
So what we did is we prototyped
some alternative ways of giving

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.400
people a stronger
visual cue, introducing

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.530
a little arrow and a circle,
just to indicate, Click Here.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.310
Suddenly we saw in
studies that people

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.780
were able to get the
most out of the product.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.160
JONAH JONES: You're
seeing a trend, generally,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.990
in modern design.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.550
Technology should be
getting out the way.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.810
And we're trying to make
all of the interactions

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.120
happen on the map, itself.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.731
We call that making the map the
user interface, because we're

00:01:22.731 --> 00:01:25.105
taking all of the controls
away from the edge of the map,

00:01:25.105 --> 00:01:27.370
and placing all the interactions
directly on the map.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.080
The thing that wows most
people about the design

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.890
of the new Google Maps is, we've
got Google Earth built directly

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.930
into the browser now,
which is pretty cool.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.570
We have all of this
incredible imagery,

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.606
all the way from Satellite
View, down via Street View,

00:01:39.606 --> 00:01:40.980
and all the way
even under water.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.688
The Great Barrier Reef
is a great example

00:01:42.688 --> 00:01:44.929
of that, because it allows
you to explore something

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:47.470
that, maybe, you're never going
to get to explore in reality.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.380
We draw inspiration from
a variety of sources

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.980
all the time.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.860
And I think nature's
a really nice one.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.860
We had this problem,
which is that we

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.720
have this incredible
satellite imagery,

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.219
and then we were overlaying the
roads and the labels on top.

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:00.570
But it really felt like we
were obscuring the imagery

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.250
with the roads.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.940
One day, I was
sitting in a park,

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.860
and I saw a leaf
lying next to me.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.699
And we realized that the roads
and everything are really

00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:09.240
quite similar to
the veins on a leaf.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.670
You can see the major highways
here, and the arterioles,

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.450
and the little, local
roads around here.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.445
And what makes this really work
is the fact that it's brighter

00:02:15.445 --> 00:02:17.650
and there's this, kind
of, darker contrast

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.720
around the edges.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.306
So we took that design approach
and put that back into Maps.

00:02:21.306 --> 00:02:22.930
Tiny, little, subtle
changes are giving

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.550
it slightly brighter coloring
and slightly darker casing.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.180
Now the satellite maps look
slightly more nature-inspired.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.920
And they look more
holistic and more

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.157
like they fit together,
instead of two overlays.

00:02:32.157 --> 00:02:34.240
SIAN TOWNSEND: Collaboration
between the designers

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.280
and researchers
at Google is more

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.130
of an ongoing conversation.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.705
Seemingly small
tweaks to a product

00:02:40.705 --> 00:02:42.620
can have a massive impact.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.480
It's through these
kinds of conversations

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.370
that we start to pinpoint
ways that we can reduce stress

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.910
in people's lives, and make
technology that people love.
