00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.275
The answer is, inside the for loop. Around this line, I need to check, whether

00:00:05.275 --> 00:00:10.420
I'm on an even or an odd count, before I decide what to print. If the counter

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.772
mod two is one, then I'm on an odd number. On odd numbers, I want to print out,

00:00:15.772 --> 00:00:22.485
the counter, and eat. Otherwise, on the even numbers I want to print out sleep.

00:00:22.485 --> 00:00:27.670
let's' see how this works. Looks like I missed the quotation mark. I get what we

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:35.499
wanted. Here I could have just said if counter is 1 or 3 or 5. Like this. And

00:00:35.499 --> 00:00:39.944
this would still work, as long as I only print six numbers. But if I wanted to

00:00:39.944 --> 00:00:46.225
print 12 items, Eliza's list wouldn't have eat after the sixth item.
