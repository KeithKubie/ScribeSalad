00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:04.860
Weird choice.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.340
Well, I guess it did come out 
20 years ago, this summer.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.240
Good enough for me.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.320
You know their names.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.280
You know their faces.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.300
And when the two of them switch,

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.400
you know they're gonna get off.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.200
"(sighs in relief)"

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.620
_

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.860
One cop will do whatever it takes
to take down the man who killed his son.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.880
By cutting his rival's face off.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.900
Putting that face on his own face.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.360
Doing absolutely nothing to change his body.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.800
Healing instantly from this massive surgery.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.680
Telling no one what he did.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.380
Going undercover in a prison
where everyone wears magnet boots.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.800
Gaining the trust of his Muppet voiced brother.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.280
"Bye, bro. Drop me a line sometime."

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.240
"(quiet chuckles)"

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.340
Getting high.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.640
And maybe porking his rival's girlfriend.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.600
All the while hoping his rival
doesn't wake from a coma.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.220
Put his face on his body.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.300
Pork his wife with his face.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.560
Kill his boss.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.060
And challenge him
to a deadly speedboat fight.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.460
Forcing him to harpoon him
with a spear gun.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.580
And adopt his love child
to replace the similar-looking son,

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.380
he killed five years ago.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.560
It all makes perfect sense,

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.520
if you're on a lot of cocaine.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.300
Prepare for the match-up you didn't know
you were waiting for.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.240
John Travolta vs Nicolas Cage,

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.160
two Oscar worthy actors,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.680
who turned into jokes.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.180
Made the effort to become
Oscar worthy again.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.900
Then realize it's way
more fun to be ridiculous.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.280
In this script that makes
slightly more sense,

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.820
when you find out it was written
for Schwarzenegger and Stallone.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.900
Aw man, that would've been awesome.
But at least we got,

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.000
Escape Plan?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.780
"Say cheese."

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.080
Ehh...

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.200
If you love action,

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.960
director John Woo,
has something for you.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.900
As Woo woos you
with his signature D'S.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:54.620
Dives.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:57.960
Dual wielding.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.900
"(Gun shots)"

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.800
And doves.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.680
As you enjoy action set pieces
that never stop.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.940
Until they stop to point
their guns at each other.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.120
Dramatically.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.920
"What we don't have in common."

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.480
Shoot!

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.100
"Is that I don't care if I live. And you do."

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.360
And shoot!

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.160
"That hurts."

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.320
Shoot now!

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.760
"(chuckling)

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.620
Hoo hoo..."

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.120
Now shoot!

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.160
Shoot!

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.380
And shoot!

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:35.840
Shoot, damn it!

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.640
Shoot each other in your faces!

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.300
Witness the over the top
craziness of two actors,

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.060
playing other actors
pretending to be themselves.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.020
I think?

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.160
Where Nic Cage acts like John Travolta
learning to act like Nic Cage.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.360
While John Travolta acts like Nic Cage,

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.700
slowly realizing how boring it is
to be John Travolta.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.720
"This is turning into a real marriage."

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.540
Confused? Don't worry.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.220
So is everyone else.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.100
"I'm Castor Troy!"

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.520
"You're Sean Archer!"

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.620
"Sean Archer."

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.120
"I am Castor Troy."

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.140
"I'm Sean."

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.220
"I'm me...

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.480
Not me. Me."

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.680
"I'm Castor.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.820
That's Archer."

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.020
"And I'm bored."

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.920
So if you love body swap comedies
like Freaky Friday.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.060
But wish everyone was trying
to kill each other.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.940
Then Face/Off is the only movie crazy enough
from 96 to 97 for you.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.380
Except maybe Con Air.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.680
Or The Rock.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.240
Wow! What a crazy couple years
for action movies, huh?

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.320
And by action movies.
I mean Nic Cage.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.320
"Wooooo!"

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.660
"Aaahhhh!"

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.800
"No more drugs for that man."

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.780
_

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.340
_

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.500
_

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.880
_

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.940
_

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.800
_

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.980
_

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.220
_

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.680
_

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.720
"My peach."

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.100
"You know I can, uh...
Eat a peach for hours."

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.620
"Your little peach, is she ripe?"

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.280
"Remember me?
I'm your favorite peach."

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.100
"Peach."

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.220
"Peaches."

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.300
_

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:19.000
(Multiple shots of John Travolta's doing
the weird face-touching habit on people)

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.140
"My darling, my beautifully, my
wickedly talented, Idina Menzel."

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.320
_

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.340
"You know we've been living together
as man and wife for a week."

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.460
How does she not know it was
her husband's face on a new body?

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.900
Did they switch dongs, too?

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.600
Because Dong/Off
is a very different movie.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.160
_

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.520
_

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.280
_

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.120
_

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.780
_
