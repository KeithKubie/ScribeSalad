00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.070
Again, we have a question with no solid right or

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.240
wrong answer. There are several different relationships that we coul

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.780
predict with this individual. Great

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.990
grandparents, grand uncles/aunts, first cousins.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.860
And there's a lot of information we could use to

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.590
help figure out which of those groups best fits. We

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.010
could look at the age of the individuals. We could

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.980
compare the Y and mitochondrial chromosomes, the haplogroups, to see

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.620
how that fits in. We can even look at interesting

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.090
patterns of X chromosome matching. Obviously, the more information that's

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.850
able to be shared between the two individuals is going to

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.400
facilitate the best particular guess that we're able to give

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.690
that person to tell them what the possible relatedness is.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.490
Now as far as advice to give to help them

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.640
connect, probably some of the best advice is, whatever it

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.410
takes for them to be prepared for the outcome that

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.980
it could be. As you can imagine, these relationships, and these

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.300
surprises and non surprises, very differently vary from

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.380
person to person. I'm going to draw your attention

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.595
one more time to the family rainbow that

00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:03.640
we've seen in lessons five and lessons 11

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.860
in this course. The representation of helping you

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.320
see what the different genetic relatedness. What your

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.830
relationships are with different people in your family

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.876
in this sort of hierarchical way. 100% to you,

00:01:15.876 --> 00:01:21.500
50% to your mothers, 50% to your parents and siblings, 25% on the next rung,

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.360
12% on the next rung. And you keep going out, and each time you go out, you

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.140
sort of half the amount of information. Ultimately, you've

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.710
got to be a good Sherlock Holmes. You've

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.880
got to use context clues, and you've gotta

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.060
talk to people. Genetic genealogy is an amazing profession.
