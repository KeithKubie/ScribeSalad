00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:31.779
With the long-running debate over mandatory
minimum sentences over the past couple of

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.519
decades, it’s easy to forget that judges
and juries often have a great deal of discretion

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:40.480
when it comes to imposing criminal sentences
for individual crimes.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.640
So while we can’t say what single crime
will definitively result in the longest prison

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.940
sentence, we can look at the crimes that have
resulted in the records for the longest prison

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.720
sentences in the United States and around
the globe.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.899
To begin with, the longest prison sentence
ever imposed was 141,078 years.

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.869
It was given in 1989 in Thailand to Chamoy
Thipyaso and each of her seven accomplices

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:08.591
for defrauding more than 16,000 Chinese investors
as a part of a massive Ponzi scheme.

00:01:08.591 --> 00:01:09.930
(see: What is a Ponzi Scheme and Why Do We
Call It That?)

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.490
On the other hand, in the U.S. the longest
sentence for some form of corporate fraud

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.030
was only 845 years.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.740
This was handed down in 2000 to Sholam Weiss,
for his role in the collapse of National Heritage

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:21.740
Life Insurance.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.090
By contrast, Bernie Madoff was only given
150 years for his 2009 conviction of defrauding

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.140
thousands in a multi-billion dollar Ponzi
scheme.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.460
The second and third longest prison sentences
(for any crime), globally, were given to Jamal

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:44.360
Zougam (42,924 years) and Emilio Suárez Trashorras
(49,922 years) for their roles in the 2004

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.020
train bombings in Madrid.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.400
As for the longest prison term imposed in
the United States, it was given in 1994 to

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.030
the Oklahoma child rapist Charles Schott Robinson
who was convicted of six counts of rape garnering

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.210
him 5,000 years in prison each- a whopping
30,000 year sentence.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.259
Also in Oklahoma, Darron B. Anderson and Allan
W. McLaurin each had in the thousands of years

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:10.049
ranges of prison time imposed for the kidnapping,
robbery and rape of an elderly woman.

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:14.689
Anderson was initially only sentenced to 2,200
years, but upon his second trial (he appealed

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:18.480
and won a new one), that second jury imposed
a sentence of 11,250 years.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.400
McLaurin was initially sentenced to 21,250
years, but the appellate court reduced it

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.270
to a mere 500 years.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.920
In 1981, after killing his wife, mother-in-law
and an unlucky visitor to their home, Dudley

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.890
Wayne Kyzer was sentenced to 10,000 years,
along with a couple of life sentences, by

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:35.890
an Alabama court.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.049
He has been up for, and denied, parole nine
times.

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:43.579
The longest prison sentence imposed in Australia
was given to Martin Bryant in 1996 for the

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:48.739
Port Arthur, Tasmania massacre where he killed
35 and injured 23 others.

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:55.230
His sentence included 1,035 years without
parole plus 35 life sentences, one for each

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.230
life he took.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.669
Large prison sentences continue to be imposed
today.

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:04.050
Cleveland’s Ariel Castro received, as part
of a plea deal in 2013, life plus 1,000 years

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.569
for the kidnapping, rape and murder (for the
intentional inducing of miscarriages) of three

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:10.689
women over a 10-plus year period.

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:13.279
He hanged himself in prison in 2013.

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:17.879
The infamous Aurora theater shooter, James
Holmes, was given 12 life sentences plus an

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:24.579
additional 3,318 years in 2015 for killing
12 people and injuring another 70.

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:29.609
Yet another extremely lengthy sentence doled
out in 2015 was given to Billy Godfrey of

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:30.609
Rolla, Missouri.

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:35.579
His punishment included 35 life sentences
for convictions of 35 counts of statutory

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:36.579
sodomy.

00:03:36.579 --> 00:04:35.870
His victims, assaulted between 1995 and 1999,
were between the ages 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:05:21.110
of 8 and 13 at 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:44.970
the 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:57.920
time 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:27.190
of Godfrey’s crimes.
