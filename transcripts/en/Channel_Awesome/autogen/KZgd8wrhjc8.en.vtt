voices aren't adding up well that's
 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.309 align:start position:0%
voices aren't adding up well that's
because<00:00:04.770><c> we</c><00:00:05.100><c> actually</c><00:00:05.310><c> recorded</c><00:00:06.180><c> this</c><00:00:06.359><c> before</c>

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 align:start position:0%
because we actually recorded this before
 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.320 align:start position:0%
because we actually recorded this before
but<00:00:07.710><c> like</c><00:00:07.919><c> a</c><00:00:07.980><c> dumbass</c><00:00:08.280><c> I</c><00:00:08.700><c> didn't</c><00:00:08.940><c> have</c><00:00:09.030><c> the</c><00:00:09.150><c> mic</c>

setup<00:00:09.660><c> so</c><00:00:10.340><c> Jason</c><00:00:11.340><c> had</c><00:00:11.460><c> the</c><00:00:11.580><c> idea</c><00:00:11.790><c> that</c><00:00:11.969><c> we</c><00:00:12.059><c> just</c>

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 align:start position:0%
setup so Jason had the idea that we just
 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
setup so Jason had the idea that we just
record<00:00:12.599><c> the</c><00:00:12.780><c> audio</c><00:00:12.960><c> cuz</c><00:00:13.469><c> that'll</c><00:00:14.280><c> be</c><00:00:14.429><c> easier</c>

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 align:start position:0%
record the audio cuz that'll be easier
 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.240 align:start position:0%
record the audio cuz that'll be easier
and<00:00:14.910><c> faster</c><00:00:15.089><c> yeah</c><00:00:15.690><c> and</c><00:00:16.080><c> and</c><00:00:16.470><c> that</c><00:00:16.680><c> we</c><00:00:16.830><c> just</c><00:00:16.859><c> put</c>

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 align:start position:0%
and faster yeah and and that we just put
 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.450 align:start position:0%
and faster yeah and and that we just put
it<00:00:17.369><c> over</c><00:00:17.520><c> this</c><00:00:17.910><c> video</c><00:00:18.180><c> yeah</c><00:00:18.930><c> some</c><00:00:19.740><c> things</c><00:00:19.770><c> I</c>

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 align:start position:0%
it over this video yeah some things I
 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.340 align:start position:0%
it over this video yeah some things I
mean<00:00:20.880><c> I</c><00:00:20.939><c> think</c><00:00:21.029><c> a</c><00:00:21.240><c> little</c><00:00:21.300><c> bit</c><00:00:21.420><c> more</c><00:00:21.510><c> like</c><00:00:21.960><c> sync</c>

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 align:start position:0%
mean I think a little bit more like sync
 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.200 align:start position:0%
mean I think a little bit more like sync
up<00:00:22.500><c> pretty</c><00:00:22.710><c> good</c><00:00:22.800><c> yeah</c><00:00:23.310><c> that's</c><00:00:23.519><c> my</c><00:00:23.730><c> guess</c><00:00:24.029><c> I</c>

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 align:start position:0%
up pretty good yeah that's my guess I
 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.880 align:start position:0%
up pretty good yeah that's my guess I
mean<00:00:24.330><c> there's</c><00:00:24.510><c> a</c><00:00:24.600><c> part</c><00:00:24.779><c> me</c><00:00:24.900><c> that</c><00:00:25.050><c> goes</c><00:00:25.230><c> maybe</c>

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 align:start position:0%
mean there's a part me that goes maybe
 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.759 align:start position:0%
mean there's a part me that goes maybe
we<00:00:26.430><c> should</c><00:00:26.699><c> just</c><00:00:26.939><c> record</c><00:00:27.539><c> ourselves</c><00:00:27.779><c> talking</c>

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 align:start position:0%
we should just record ourselves talking
 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.460 align:start position:0%
we should just record ourselves talking
as<00:00:28.859><c> well</c><00:00:29.099><c> with</c><00:00:29.340><c> the</c><00:00:29.519><c> video</c><00:00:29.820><c> because</c><00:00:30.359><c> you</c><00:00:31.349><c> know</c>

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 align:start position:0%
as well with the video because you know
 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.500 align:start position:0%
as well with the video because you know
it's<00:00:31.920><c> the</c><00:00:32.040><c> exact</c><00:00:32.430><c> same</c><00:00:32.610><c> amount</c><00:00:32.759><c> of</c><00:00:33.000><c> work</c><00:00:33.180><c> and</c>

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 align:start position:0%
it's the exact same amount of work and
 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.209 align:start position:0%
it's the exact same amount of work and
the<00:00:33.690><c> camera</c><00:00:34.380><c> doesn't</c><00:00:34.590><c> have</c><00:00:34.680><c> to</c><00:00:34.860><c> do</c><00:00:34.980><c> anything</c>

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 align:start position:0%
the camera doesn't have to do anything
 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.910 align:start position:0%
the camera doesn't have to do anything
different<00:00:35.670><c> but</c><00:00:35.850><c> I'm</c><00:00:36.719><c> sure</c><00:00:37.500><c> it's</c><00:00:37.620><c> more</c><00:00:37.739><c> work</c>

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
different but I'm sure it's more work
 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.020 align:start position:0%
different but I'm sure it's more work
somehow<00:00:38.160><c> so</c><00:00:38.340><c> we're</c><00:00:38.460><c> just</c><00:00:38.489><c> gonna</c><00:00:38.640><c> do</c><00:00:38.820><c> it</c><00:00:38.910><c> this</c>

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 align:start position:0%
somehow so we're just gonna do it this
 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
somehow so we're just gonna do it this
way<00:00:39.829><c> but</c><00:00:40.829><c> actually</c><00:00:41.219><c> if</c><00:00:41.340><c> there</c><00:00:41.520><c> is</c><00:00:41.640><c> another</c>

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 align:start position:0%
way but actually if there is another
 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.569 align:start position:0%
way but actually if there is another
reason<00:00:42.210><c> we're</c><00:00:42.360><c> doing</c><00:00:42.480><c> this</c><00:00:42.780><c> because</c><00:00:43.500><c> in</c><00:00:43.770><c> the</c><00:00:44.430><c> V</c>

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 align:start position:0%
reason we're doing this because in the V
 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.310 align:start position:0%
reason we're doing this because in the V

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 align:start position:0%
Frank Miller does it because his rain is

of a show it is and I think so much of
that<00:09:09.930><c> is</c><00:09:10.200><c> because</c><00:09:10.470><c> they</c><00:09:11.430><c> just</c><00:09:11.760><c> they</c><00:09:12.150><c> never</c><00:09:12.390><c> say</c>

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
