GUS GOSTYLA: Welcome, everyone.

00:00:03.564 --> 00:00:05.579
They put us back in the
corner, because they

00:00:05.579 --> 00:00:06.870
knew we were the loose cannons.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.130
So we're way in the back.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.110
Hope you're woken
up from your lunch.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:11.930
Welcome, everyone.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:12.930
Thanks for coming today.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.900
I'm Gus Gostyla, and I
look after cultivating

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.060
our relationships with the
venture capital and startup

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.920
community on behalf of
Google and Android, Google

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.030
Play and Android.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.720
And my colleague
is Ellie Powers,

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.960
who will take the second half,
who leads our developer product

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.984
team here.

00:00:30.984 --> 00:00:32.900
The two of us have been
spending a lot of time

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.760
with startups this year.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.595
So I'd like to ask how many
people work at startups

00:00:38.595 --> 00:00:39.470
who are in the crowd.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.330
Get a show of hands.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.840
Awesome.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.230
Like, it's less than 100
people kind of companies.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.420
That's great.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.360
You're in the right place.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.460
So we're here to talk
to you about how many of

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.220
you are succeeding
on Google Play,

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.720
and why more and more
are launching on Android

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.500
and SIM shipping your apps.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.970
And to start, you could say
this is a bit of a passion

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.800
area for me personally.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.690
I spent a good chunk of my
career at mobile startups.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.520
Most recently ones like
Inkling and Flipboard.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.720
And now I get to sit on
the other side of the fence

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.680
where my team is
focused exclusively

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.520
on helping startups
succeed and making it

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.170
feel like less of a black art.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.482
So while the team is new,
in just the last few months

00:01:30.482 --> 00:01:32.440
it's already become
obvious to Ellie and myself

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.940
that there are some
recurring themes

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.430
we hear from startups
that come to Android.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.010
And so we'd like to discuss
those with you here.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.840
Specifically, we broke
the recurring themes

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.381
down into three
buckets that we would

00:01:45.381 --> 00:01:49.495
label as follows-- Reach, the
Next Billion, and Iteration.

00:01:49.495 --> 00:01:50.870
And we'll spend
our time drilling

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.670
down on how to get
the most out of those.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.330
And we'll also share
three case studies

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.860
of startups who are really
representing those themes well

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.520
and demonstrating best
practices in these areas.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.220
So let's get started with
Reach and the First Billion

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.080
before we go on to
the Next Billion.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.184
You've probably heard
of Benedict Evans

00:02:11.184 --> 00:02:12.350
over at Andreessen Horowitz.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.770
He's one of my personal
favorite mobile pundits

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.530
in the mobile tech world.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.100
And he's prolific with his
dispatches on subject of mobile

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.350
eating the world.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.300
So a few months ago
he said this-- mobile

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.080
is the first universal
tech product.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.550
And he was referring to the
data on the following slide.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.050
And he points out
some projections

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.560
from various
sources, specifically

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.660
global population on the left
of nearly 8 billion people

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.180
projected in 2020.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.480
And the population of people
over 16 years old at 6 billion.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.890
And finally, smartphones
projected at 5 billion in 2020,

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.280
way further on the left.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.510
And the expected growth
you can see in purple

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.080
between 2015 and 2020.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.740
His point is, and my
point is, that smartphones

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.180
are starting to get close
to nearly reaching everyone

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.930
on the planet.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.520
And that's kind of a big deal.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.490
It's pretty profound
and non-trivial when

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.220
you consider how
little effort is

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.590
required to make
and sell products

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.017
that reach nearly everyone.

00:03:19.017 --> 00:03:20.850
And there's never really
been a similar kind

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.940
of product or platform.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.190
Sure, Coca-Cola, bicycles, and
refrigerators are neat too,

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.840
and they have great reach.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.090
But they're not quite the
same democratizing platforms

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.050
for allowing the world
to communicate, transact,

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.484
and disseminate information
in quite the same way.

00:03:39.484 --> 00:03:40.900
So now when we
think about Android

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.210
and how it factors into
that global reach, last year

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.120
Android crossed a
pretty huge threshold

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.840
with over a billion devices
shipped around the world.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.000
And now you can see us logging
in 1.4 billion 30-day actives.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.450
And we've seen 1.5
million Android devices

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:57.920
being activated daily.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.400
And the continued platform
momentum of 400 OEMs

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.770
and 500 operators
on the platform.

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.260
It's pretty incredible
that Play was launched just

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.760
over four years ago.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.200
While Android is expanding
the footprint of device

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.700
availability, Play is helping
developers build businesses

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.020
across the globe.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.829
And it's growing pretty
fast in its own right.

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.160
Way back when I
was in your shoes,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.300
back at mobile app startups
and Android was just

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.370
getting started, in the echo
chamber here in the Valley

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.160
it was still kind of
fashionable to pick on Android

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.160
and say it lacked billion
dollar startup success stories.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.930
And then something
funny happened.

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.680
Companies like WhatsApp and
Uber, Line King, Flipkart,

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.380
Spotify, Supercell
started sprouting up

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.590
in these insane
growth trajectories,

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.290
and have become massive global
brands in their own right.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.130
Ask any of those
companies now if Android

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.421
is important to their business.

00:04:53.421 --> 00:04:54.540
And I think they'll agree.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.460
My point is this-- my experience
at startups made it clear

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.790
that a founder's
job is fundamentally

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.220
to challenge the
status quo thinking,

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.880
and observe what is
changing around you.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.160
Ask yourself what you know
to be true in the future,

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.536
and execute relentlessly
on your vision.

00:05:11.536 --> 00:05:12.910
So in that light,
I'd ask you all

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.660
to take a hard look
at Android when you're

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.260
getting started
on your next idea,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.730
and consider how Reach
might factor heavily

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.334
in your startup's
growth objectives.

00:05:20.334 --> 00:05:22.750
Of course, many of you have
already asked these questions.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.580
And that's why
you're here today.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.120
And so keep plugging
away on Android.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.320
That's awesome.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.150
Once you've made your
Android platform decision,

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.870
what should you do next to
realize the full benefits

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:35.990
of smartphone reach?

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.510
Well, there's a couple things
you need to know to get there.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.520
In our experience, these
are the first few things

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.380
you should be thinking about.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.520
Building for reach.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.290
So let's begin with material.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.310
The last session was
all about material.

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.960
And there was code on
slides and all that stuff.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.280
We're not going to
do that here today.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.310
But I did want to
point this one out,

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.310
because maybe it's not
immediately obvious,

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.870
but material has been
crucial for startups

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.160
trying to attain reach.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.140
And in that material offers
one universal language

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.590
for navigation and interaction
that is becoming second nature

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:10.604
for Android users.

00:06:10.604 --> 00:06:12.520
And I myself, having
come from those startups,

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.436
I was skeptical about
material when they first

00:06:14.436 --> 00:06:17.760
told me about it, and
felt like our apps should

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.850
look the same across all
platforms and that kind

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.650
of thing.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.770
But basically what I've learned
is that by using material,

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:28.970
you already have
a huge head start

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.210
on using a design that
most of those billion

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.050
plus users around the
world already understand,

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.200
and in a way that is so
prevalent that it's now

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.274
making its way onto
other platforms, as well.

00:06:41.274 --> 00:06:42.690
As a result,
developers are seeing

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.080
leaps in engagement
and conversion rates

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.540
across the board when
they implement it.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.300
And you can see some of
the great examples here.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.010
Apps like Fablic,
Musicmatch, Trello

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:57.330
seeing some notable increases
in time and activity

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.080
in their apps.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.150
And so yes, material is cool.

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:02.760
But also think from
the business side

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:10.180
about it being this common
language that everybody gets.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.727
While startups told us material
design was cool when we first

00:07:14.727 --> 00:07:17.060
announced it, you also told
us that it was a little hard

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.940
to know where to get
started, and that you

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.420
wanted more resources to make
building material apps easier.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:24.656
And so we totally heard you.

00:07:24.656 --> 00:07:26.030
And over the past
few years we've

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:27.738
been rolling out a
bunch of new resources

00:07:27.738 --> 00:07:30.540
that you can find at
design.google.com.

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:33.050
I won't go into all the
details of all these things

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:36.330
here, given the last
presentation probably

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.580
went into great depth there.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:43.999
But that's a hub you can
go find resources from.

00:07:43.999 --> 00:07:45.540
Another thing a lot
of startups worry

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.914
about when they're approaching
Android for the first time

00:07:47.914 --> 00:07:49.600
is device compatibility.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.510
Last year at Google I/O we
announced Cloud Test lab

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:53.030
and Beta.

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:55.250
And this year we're taking
the training wheels off

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:56.990
and moving it into Firebase.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.490
And as you'd expect,
Firebase test lab

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.570
is integrated with
many different tools.

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:04.025
So you can bring it into
your workflow easily.

00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:05.650
I'm sure some of you
have probably been

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:08.350
to other sessions
on Firebase already.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:11.230
And I would urge
you as a startup

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:14.500
to really think about this
platform, because it's

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.920
got so many different
things in it

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.360
wrapped up into
one great package,

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.720
whereas companies that
are a little further along

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.890
tend to specialize in
the tools they use.

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:28.560
So Firebase is especially
well-suited to startups

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.870
who are just figuring it out.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:34.024
In Google Play, all
alpha and beta apps

00:08:34.024 --> 00:08:36.190
are tested against a
representative range of devices

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:37.840
of profiles in the cloud.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.080
This test is
completely automated.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.130
So you don't need to
write test scripts.

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.540
You can detect where there
are any obvious issues

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:48.580
on these devices before rolling
out your app to all users.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.560
And you can now enable this
from within the dev console.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.190
The best part of the
base level of this

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:59.430
is that it's totally
free, which is awesome.

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:02.750
After trying the pre-launch
report in the death console,

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.560
the next thing
developers say they

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.790
want is to run exactly
the set of tasks they want

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:09.620
on a specific set of devices.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.819
And they'll be a
way to do that too.

00:09:11.819 --> 00:09:13.610
You'll be able to write
custom test scripts

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:16.320
and run them on physical or
virtual devices you choose.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.840
And you can even do that
from Android Studio,

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.310
your other continuous
integration systems.

00:09:24.907 --> 00:09:27.240
Once you have a good sense
that your product is working,

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.320
another great way
to grow reach is

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.960
to obviously expand to
other countries, globally.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.210
You'll need to think
about localizing your app

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:37.170
and your Play Store listing.

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:39.140
From within the dev
console, we provide

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.140
tools and recommendations
to help you translate

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:44.020
your app across global markets.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.380
Take Netflix, for example.

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:49.510
They recently had a lot of press
about globalizing their app.

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:52.010
And you know, they didn't just
translate their title and app

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:54.510
description, but also
made sure screenshots

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:58.260
and video trailers accurately
represented the app

00:09:58.260 --> 00:09:59.038
in all markets.

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:03.675
Pricing.

00:10:03.675 --> 00:10:05.050
Also an area you
want to consider

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:07.170
to make sure your
price translates

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:11.470
for local expectations,
making sure your price doesn't

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:15.000
look like it's like
$1.73, like here.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.590
Or the cultural
equivalent of that,

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:20.310
which differs by country,
what the sort of standards

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:21.370
are around pricing.

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:24.350
And so we help you figure
that out automatically.

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:26.470
For example, we saw 2x lift.

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:29.960
You can see here in
Japan for those that

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.970
rounded to the nearest yen.

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.254
So this was pretty cool.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:39.750
So now that you've heard
more about tactical advice

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:42.670
on extracting benefits
of reach out of Android,

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:44.380
let's hear more from
a startup developer

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.950
who has been capitalizing on
some of those opportunities.

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:49.810
WeVideo is a startup right
here in our backyard,

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:52.290
and has some relevant
experience to share.

00:10:55.254 --> 00:10:56.242
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:56.242 --> 00:11:00.630
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.130
-WeVideo was founded
with the vision

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:05.020
of making digital storytelling
and video creation

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.106
accessible to anyone, anywhere.

00:11:07.106 --> 00:11:08.480
When we first
started in Android,

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.854
we clearly saw that there
wasn't a compelling application

00:11:10.854 --> 00:11:12.330
for a video creation.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:15.280
Combine that with the fast
growth of Android platforms,

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:16.990
we decided to go Android first.

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:19.172
Since then, the majority
of our investment

00:11:19.172 --> 00:11:22.494
in smartphone development
has been on Android.

00:11:22.494 --> 00:11:24.660
What separates us from other
applications on Android

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.540
is that we give you the full
capability of the device

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:28.590
in our application.

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:31.556
You're able to take
different clips, trim them.

00:11:31.556 --> 00:11:33.430
And we're able to do
that because the Android

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:35.810
platform gave us access
to the open GL there,

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:39.424
which allowed us to do real
time rendering and previewing.

00:11:39.424 --> 00:11:41.090
Since the launch of
our new application,

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:43.280
mobile monetization has
done very well for us.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.020
Our revenue on Android has
doubled every two months.

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:49.106
Almost 85% of our
users are on Android.

00:11:49.106 --> 00:11:51.490
We'd launch a
material design, we

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:54.430
decided to redo the application
and redo the user experience,

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:56.190
and take it up to
the next level.

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:57.960
-Many of the material
design concepts

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.700
really resonated with us.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.070
We were really able to create
a delightful experience

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:03.650
for our users.

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:08.800
And as a result, we saw 100%
increase in user engagement.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.690
Being able to reply to
reviews is a great feature.

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:13.580
Every day we go through
every single review

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:15.832
and analyze the data
that's coming in.

00:12:15.832 --> 00:12:17.540
And most importantly,
if there's somebody

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:20.330
who's having a problem,
we can help right away.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:21.760
And it's such a
good feeling when

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.840
you can see someone who gave you
one star review converting that

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.840
to four or five stars.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.160
We love running experiments
on the Play Store.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.830
For example, just recently
we updated our screen shots

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:37.070
with the colors, the text, and
we saw increase in conversion

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:39.410
up to 50%.

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:41.450
Making the app available
in different languages

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:44.780
is critical for you to
succeed in global market.

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:48.460
We saw increase in our installs
up 200% in some regions

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:52.540
after we revised our app and
a Play Store descriptions.

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:55.725
Recently, we revisited our
purchasing flow in the app.

00:12:55.725 --> 00:12:58.030
We wanted to see if we
could convert more people

00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:59.430
to buy our premium products.

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:02.730
We decided to change colors
of the background, font size

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:04.150
way out of the elements.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.150
We were able to deploy
quickly and trade just

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:07.560
within a few days.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:11.750
And we say an increase up to
60% in the conversion rate.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:14.000
-The Android platform has
been a great platform for us

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.880
to iterate through
our applications.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.970
With the fast app publishing
process, Play Store listing

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:21.030
experiments,
feedback from users,

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:23.820
and monetization
using Google Wallet,

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.440
this has led to a tremendous
increase in success

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.980
with installs and revenue.

00:13:34.311 --> 00:13:36.259
[END PLAYBACK]

00:13:42.778 --> 00:13:43.528
GUS GOSTYLA: Cool.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.750
So we talked a little bit about
Reach in the last billion.

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:53.000
So let's talk about getting
to the next billion.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.600
That will likely come
online for the first time

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.480
on mobile in emerging markets.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:02.300
In a sense, we've been spoiled
by tech in the developed world.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:05.540
And while we were validating
our cars, Ubering around town,

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:08.750
ordering dinner delivery, and
frolicking with the spirit

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:10.900
guide butcher in the
BlackRock desert,

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:14.830
it's easy to forget that
phones being purchased

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:18.030
in the developing world could
be somebody's first computer,

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:20.480
first source of books,
education, health

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:24.640
advice, access to e-commerce,
news, microfinance,

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:27.870
or entrepreneurial inspiration.

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:31.280
While it might feel like
these markets are behind,

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:33.040
leap-frogging
opportunities are being

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:36.070
created, as some are
learning to transact globally

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:38.750
for the first time on
mobile, not desktop.

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:44.960
And hence their behavior
is mobile first by default.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.920
Fred Wilson at Union
Square Ventures

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.840
recently called out
this opportunity

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:53.810
in a blog post called The Second
Smartphone Revolution, where

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:56.280
he was specifically referencing
the transformational mobile

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.940
impact in emerging markets.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:01.420
He asked whether the
winners in the next phase

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:03.920
would come from Silicon Valley
or from the local developing

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.480
world.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.400
It's up to you to find out.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.020
But I'm incredibly excited to
see how both sets of founders

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:13.810
go and solve some of the
incredible new challenges

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:17.220
in emerging markets
with their apps.

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.470
Coincidentally, he too
referenced Benedict Evans

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:24.070
in that article, here who
says, "Yes, everyone."

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:26.990
And points out that the
incredible reach of mobile

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:29.850
as a percentage of coverage
of the African population

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:32.750
is surpassing even grid
electricity and soon,

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:34.140
clean water.

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:38.530
He also points out
the role of Android

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:40.060
and its affordability,
which helps

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:43.285
drive this transformational
reach and access.

00:15:43.285 --> 00:15:45.410
Consider that while the
developed world has created

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:48.120
a lot of solutions for
first world problems,

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:51.190
and is closer to reaching
device saturation,

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:54.270
there is a lot of blank space
for expansion in the developing

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:57.545
world where the next
billion will come from,

00:15:57.545 --> 00:15:59.920
and where the problems outside
of our little echo chamber

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:03.660
can be far more profound
and life-changing to solve.

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.380
In other words, a whole
new wave of innovation

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.330
is just beginning, not
just at the level of luxury

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:11.280
and convenience,
but from the bottom

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.800
of Maslow's hierarchy of
needs, all the way to the top.

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:19.220
Putting that back in context
of reach to real people,

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:22.900
the projections are that
1.2 billion new users

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:25.640
will come online in
emerging markets by 2018.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.620
So what can you do to reach
them with your new ideas?

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:30.940
First understand some
of the constraints

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.170
and best practices designed for.

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:35.570
We've done a lot of
talking here this week

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:37.540
about the next billion.

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:40.310
But obviously, the
slower data connections,

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:43.790
users that pay as they go,
paying closer attention

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:45.630
to their consumption,
disconnected

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:48.970
scenarios and opportunities
for offline modes

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:53.190
and caching, low end devices
with different lower storage

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:55.975
and battery specs
mean you want to keep

00:16:55.975 --> 00:17:01.660
APK updates, [INAUDIBLE] small,
and other notable things.

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:05.380
Which brings me to some things
we have done recently with Play

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:08.040
to eat our own dog food and
develop solutions to some

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.910
of these challenges ourselves.

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:12.490
Specifically, we've been
working to automatically make

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:15.849
the store more efficient for
you, given the constraints I

00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:18.540
just shared.

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:21.319
First, we've been improving our
identification and promotion

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:23.280
of locally relevant apps.

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.920
If your app meets the
needs of emerging markets,

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:30.360
and for example, works
well on slow connections,

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:34.942
supports local languages, we'll
make sure users find your app.

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:40.080
Second, we've been working
to make the store more data

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:40.579
efficient.

00:17:40.579 --> 00:17:43.320
So Google Play is investing
in making updates smaller.

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:45.740
As you can see here,
when you update your app,

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:48.030
Play computes the difference
from the older version.

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:51.570
We've also updated the story UI
to show the delta in size that

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.400
needs to be downloaded
by the user,

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.820
instead of the entire app size.

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:57.270
Updates can be really small.

00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:59.630
And so this helps users get
less nervous about the size

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:02.290
of the download.

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:04.810
Last but not least, payments.

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:08.250
In the last 12 months, we
enabled 61 new forms of payment

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:13.170
in 32 markets, which means that
400 million people have access

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:16.200
to a new form of payment.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.400
Just to zoom in on one
example of a roll out of DCB--

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.680
direct carrier billing.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:25.290
In Indonesia, you can see the
crazy inflection point here

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:27.070
where we rolled
it out represents

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:32.280
a 4x increase in buyer growth.

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:34.460
We've seen very similar
results in other countries

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:36.960
like Turkey, Saudi
Arabia, and the UAE.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.480
We recommend running
promotions in your apps

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.070
to get a share of
that excitement

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:45.860
when we launch new payment
support in those countries.

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:49.126
As I mentioned, you can sell
your app in 130 countries.

00:18:49.126 --> 00:18:51.250
Not surprisingly, the more
locally relevant payment

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:54.440
methods we add, the more
users become buyers.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.700
And you can see some of
the specific uplift metrics

00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:00.540
here, most notably 30%
year over year growth

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:02.710
in developer's
international sales,

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:05.600
and some big movements here in
various markets like Germany,

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:09.070
Russia, and in Hong Kong.

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:10.480
Purchasing behavior
in particular

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.310
varies significantly
between markets.

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:15.390
So to provide developers
with more flexibility,

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:17.240
we have worked to adapt
Google Play pricing

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:21.820
options to better suit local
purchasing power parity levels,

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:23.730
and make content
more accessible.

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:28.380
Following a successful pilot
in India earlier this year,

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:29.950
earlier this year,
today developers

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:33.250
have the option to reduce the
price of their premium titles

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:36.540
and in-app products
in 17 more countries

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:39.780
to new minimum thresholds like
the ones you can see here.

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.440
In this example, you can see
the impact of lower prices

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.800
more in line with
local markets resulted

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:52.070
in 136% increase in
spike in orders, which

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:55.360
overcame the drop
in price with volume

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.840
for an overall game
of 27% in revenue.

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:01.980
So you're absolutely
reaching more people

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:03.328
and still making more money.

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:07.410
So with that, I
hope you're starting

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:10.600
to get the sense of this
theme of how relentlessly

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.280
our teams are
working to pass along

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:14.180
big improvements
to the platform,

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:17.010
and how passionate we are about
investing in our developer

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:18.077
community.

00:20:18.077 --> 00:20:20.160
I'd like to transition
into another startup story.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:23.310
This time, Sendy based
in Kenya, solving

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:27.080
for challenges of local
delivery and very crowded cities

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:27.713
like Nairobi.

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:32.623
Go ahead and play.

00:20:32.623 --> 00:20:33.248
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:33.248 --> 00:20:36.116
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:42.870
-Sendy is a Kenyan company.

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:45.285
We connect customers
and logistics providers.

00:20:45.285 --> 00:20:47.710
What we've done
differently is figuring out

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:50.030
the last minute logistics,
which is a problem in most

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:51.000
developing countries.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.310
I mean, we don't have
things like addresses here.

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:59.260
-Being able to use technology
to solve a problem that really

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:02.760
nobody has been able
to solve in this region

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.960
is probably the
most exciting beat.

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:09.500
Sendy has two Android
apps, one for the customers

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:11.410
and one for the drivers.

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:13.170
The great thing
about Sendy is you're

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:17.020
able to drop pins for your
pickup and dropoff locations.

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:19.390
So it's easier for you
to identify it on a map

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:23.170
rather than entering
an actual address.

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:26.350
We went to Android because the
majority of the users in Kenya,

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:28.770
East Africa, has Android
phones, and the fact

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:30.316
that the process
of actually doing

00:21:30.316 --> 00:21:31.940
that continuous
deployment to customers

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:35.220
is much faster than
other platforms.

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:38.600
As a startup that is
constantly trying new things,

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:41.160
we tend to dole
out features a lot.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:44.110
Cool feature in the
Google K developer console

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:46.640
is the alpha meter
testing groups.

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:49.830
We normally roll out our
new versions of the app

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:54.730
to groups that help us test and
get as many bugs as possible

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:56.870
before the app goes
into final release.

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.940
Most people love
it when the UI flow

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:06.060
is as easy to use as possible.

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:09.860
Material design offers a very
simple language for people

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:14.650
to understand on a phone that
most Kenyans appreciate it.

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:17.130
When developing apps
for the Kenyan market,

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:19.360
there are certain things
that you need to consider.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.110
You need to make sure
that your APK size is not

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:23.730
too large, because
most people don't

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:26.050
have a lot of storage space.

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:29.195
You also need to check
the amount of data

00:22:29.195 --> 00:22:30.755
your app is using,
because people

00:22:30.755 --> 00:22:34.210
are very sensitive of the
amount of data they use.

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:36.590
Battery usage is
also very important.

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:40.130
People don't have the luxury
of plugging in their phones

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:42.560
all the time.

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:44.720
-One of the key things
must be building trust

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:45.467
among your users.

00:22:45.467 --> 00:22:47.300
So one of the things
we did in the beginning

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:49.580
is provide free
delivery to customers.

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:51.780
The other way of building
trust is making sure

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:53.450
that we keep the
customer [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:56.810
know where the driver is
through our Android app.

00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:59.790
-The way we've utilized
Google Play Developer

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:03.520
Console to establish
trust is that first we

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:07.490
make sure that our ratings
on the Play Store are high.

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:10.350
We also rely on statistics
such as the number

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:12.930
of crashes per app version.

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:15.010
That is very helpful
for me as a developer

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:17.650
to know what bugs I
should escalate and fix

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:20.420
as quickly as possible.

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:22.900
-I think integrating local
payments is very, very

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:26.160
key as well to this access of
customers using your product.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.480
Over 80% of our customers
pay for services

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.215
using mobile money.

00:23:31.215 --> 00:23:34.950
We have been seeing financial
growth within the company.

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:37.080
We've gone from a team
of three to now a team

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:39.500
of about 23 people.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:42.980
-Being able not only to have
an impact to the end user,

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:45.480
but also to the drivers
in our platform.

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:48.090
So giving them an
income that they weren't

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:51.060
able to earn a few
months ago is really

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:54.550
something that is touching
for me as a person.

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:59.810
I feel that we are driving the
economy in the littlest way

00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:00.900
possible.

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:03.060
But we're still
driving the economy,

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:04.320
which is enough for me.

00:24:08.613 --> 00:24:11.480
[END PLAYBACK]

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:12.770
GUS GOSTYLA: So cool.

00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:14.790
I just love-- you
know, we get so

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:17.490
wrapped up in the
stuff in our backyard

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:18.560
here in Silicon Valley.

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:22.460
And it's awesome to see startups
all over the world solving

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:25.310
very diverse sets of problems.

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:28.970
And I just see that there's
so much more opportunity there

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:32.500
for the next phase.

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:35.080
If the next billion in emerging
markets is of strong interest

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.240
to you, I also encourage
you to stick around

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:40.310
for the next session, which will
go into detail on initiatives

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:43.820
and progress we are making
to open up those markets.

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:46.490
Next up is Ellie, who you might
recognize from the Keynote

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:51.300
on Instant Apps yesterday, and
then Play stuff this morning.

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:53.842
And Ellie, it's all yours.

00:24:53.842 --> 00:24:57.244
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.470
ELLIE POWERS: Thanks
very much, Gus.

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:03.044
So one of the most
exciting things

00:25:03.044 --> 00:25:04.710
that Gus alluded to
a little bit earlier

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:06.330
that my team has
been doing this year

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:10.400
is we make Google
Play and the developer

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:14.570
console for so many different
types of developers, right?

00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:15.810
Big companies.

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:17.930
Small companies.

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:21.100
Countries here in Mountain
View, countries in Kenya,

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.890
all sorts of
different developers.

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:25.660
And the new emphasis we really
put on in this past year

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:27.980
was to work with
startups specifically.

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:30.440
And so Gus' team has had a
big outreach program where

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.830
we try to go and actually
meet with more startups

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:36.370
like all of you to understand
what information do you need

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:39.100
to be successful,
and also for my team,

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:40.910
how can we go and
refine the products

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:42.940
that we offer to all of you.

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:44.750
And so what I'm here
to talk about today

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:46.940
is basically this
idea of iteration.

00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:47.700
Right?

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:50.220
And here at Google we
got really, I guess,

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:55.100
famous for having Gmail
as a beta for a long time.

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:56.910
We didn't know
what color to make

00:25:56.910 --> 00:26:00.150
the links on Google
Search a decade ago,

00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:01.910
so we ran experiments.

00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:03.430
We love to be data-driven.

00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:04.850
We love to iterate.

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:08.030
We love to try new things, but
also get a lot of user feedback

00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:09.100
in order to improve.

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:11.100
And we think that that's
something that even now

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:13.058
that we're a big company
that we have in common

00:26:13.058 --> 00:26:14.550
with a lot of startups.

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:17.090
And so we want to make it
really possible for all of you

00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:18.960
to be able to do
the same things,

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.410
to be able to gather user
feedback really easily,

00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:23.830
which as you know, is so
critical in the early days

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:26.930
of your company, and also to
be able to try new things,

00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:31.010
iterate rapidly, and be able
get them out for users again.

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:34.030
So we really want to
empower all of you.

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:35.730
And so what we're
going to do is to go

00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:37.370
through a couple of the
different products--

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:39.411
some of them were mentioned
in some of the videos

00:26:39.411 --> 00:26:42.790
before-- to really talk about
what you should know about

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:43.620
as a startup.

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:46.580
And the reason we're giving this
talk is we have a lot of people

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:48.790
that we run into at
different startup events.

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:52.160
And they go, beta testing,
I never even heard of that.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.330
If only I had known.

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:57.050
Or really, I can reply
to my user's reviews?

00:26:57.050 --> 00:26:58.380
If only I had known.

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:00.930
And so our goal today is to
try to make sure all of you

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:05.610
here are aware of the toolkit
that we offer on Google Play.

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:09.180
So Gus actually introduced
me to this saying recently.

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:11.300
"If you want to
go fast, go alone.

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:14.060
But if you want to
go far, go together."

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:17.610
And what I really like about
this is that what we want to do

00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:21.980
is to go it with you, and
to help you go faster.

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:24.660
And we hope that through
working with Google Play,

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:29.974
you'll be able to go together,
and also go twice as fast.

00:27:29.974 --> 00:27:32.390
So we're going to talk about
four different types of tools

00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:34.190
that are the most
unique things that we

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:36.830
have to offer developers,
especially startups,

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:38.520
on Google Play.

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.200
So let's get started.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:43.660
So Google Play works a little
bit differently, right?

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:46.100
And I think one of
the things that people

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:48.390
need to know, especially if
they've been on other app

00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:50.615
platforms before, is
Google Play actually

00:27:50.615 --> 00:27:52.990
has some things that are a
little bit different about it.

00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:54.700
So the earlier in your
life you can find out

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:56.616
about all the different
features that we have,

00:27:56.616 --> 00:27:58.250
that may actually
change how you want

00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:01.050
to move through your
product development cycle.

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:03.230
So the first thing
that's important to know

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:06.040
is that for any of you who
have an app on Google Play--

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:08.950
does anyone have an app on
Google Play today, by the way?

00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:09.752
OK.

00:28:09.752 --> 00:28:11.960
Does anyone have an app
that's still in Stealth mode,

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:14.210
or not on Google Play yet?

00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:15.190
A couple folks.

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:18.480
So we're hoping to reach
you a little bit earlier.

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:20.860
So the most important
thing for you to know

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:23.980
is that you can publish your
app on Play any time you want.

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:25.892
And developers tell
us year after year

00:28:25.892 --> 00:28:27.850
that's one of the most
important things to them

00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:30.040
is that all of you are
in control about when

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.240
you can publish your app.

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:34.582
There is no big wait
or anything like that.

00:28:34.582 --> 00:28:36.540
And the next thing that
you want to think about

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:40.540
after that is this idea of beta
testing and staged rollouts.

00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:43.550
So at Google we have an app.

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:44.490
We have lots of apps.

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:46.080
And when we release
them, we don't

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.750
want to put them out there
to all the users with just

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:49.591
the initial version.

00:28:49.591 --> 00:28:50.090
Right?

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:52.790
What we want to do is
to kind of roll them out

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:55.880
more progressively and to
get feedback along the way.

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.620
So these two
tools-- beta testing

00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:59.620
and staged rollouts--
are unique tools on Play

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:01.745
that you can use to make
sure that you get a really

00:29:01.745 --> 00:29:04.290
high quality result,
and also kind of take

00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:05.750
control of your rollout.

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:08.440
And so we want to walk
you through how this is.

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:11.310
And what we see from a lot of
our most successful developers

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:13.990
is they actually use
these products every day--

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:15.820
the beta testing and
the staged rollouts.

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:17.920
So for example, at
Google, with but basically

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:20.502
every app update we rollout,
we use staged rollouts.

00:29:20.502 --> 00:29:21.960
And we think that
even startups can

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:24.250
benefit from these
sorts of things as well.

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:25.919
We see when you use
these practices,

00:29:25.919 --> 00:29:27.960
you can end up with a much
higher quality result,

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.800
a higher quality app, and a
much better business return,

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.360
as well.

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:34.522
So let's start by talking
about beta testing.

00:29:34.522 --> 00:29:35.980
Is anyone here
running a beta test,

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:38.230
or ever run one in the past?

00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:39.210
That's awesome.

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:42.050
So we actually see with some
of our most popular apps--

00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:44.970
the top 1,000 apps on
Google Play-- 60% of them

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:46.960
are running a beta
test right now.

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:49.370
And so if you haven't
tried a beta test before,

00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:51.180
here's basically the idea.

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:53.810
You can distribute your
app to a subset of users.

00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:55.540
And then you can get
feedback earlier,

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:57.960
rather than just
launching it to everyone.

00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:00.140
With beta testing,
what's important

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.650
here is users actually
need to opt in and say yes,

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:04.270
I want to be a tester.

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:06.052
And so this can be
really important,

00:30:06.052 --> 00:30:07.760
because it's not going
to be a completely

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.120
representative sample.

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:11.840
But it will be kind of
self-selecting power users--

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.650
people who are willing
to put up with bugs,

00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:15.360
and ideally also
give you feedback

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.106
about how you need to improve.

00:30:17.106 --> 00:30:18.730
So you can test two
different versions.

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:20.530
We call them alpha and beta.

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:22.510
You can view stats about them.

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:24.520
And it's a great
thing to do before you

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:26.520
rollout in production.

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:28.910
So let's talk about some of
the unique features here.

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:32.240
So users who are in a beta
or alpha test cannot actually

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:33.940
leave you a review.

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:34.830
So this is important.

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:36.890
You don't want them
to leak anything

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:38.600
or to hurt your star rating.

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:39.400
That won't happen.

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:41.090
If someone's opted
in to be a tester,

00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:43.010
they can't give you reviews.

00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:45.032
So we want to go
through a couple

00:30:45.032 --> 00:30:47.240
of the pieces of feedback
we've gotten over the years

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:49.580
to clear up any misconceptions
that might be out there.

00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:51.460
So the most common
thing we heard from you

00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:55.260
after we rolled out beta
testing was, OK, this is cool.

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:57.970
But I want to make it a
lot easier to manage who's

00:30:57.970 --> 00:30:59.850
in and out of my beta test.

00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:01.470
So last year we
announced something

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:03.490
called open and closed betas.

00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:06.090
So if you want to allow
anyone to join your beta,

00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:08.850
you can create what's
called an open beta test.

00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:11.020
This way you'll just be
able to let anyone join.

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:13.570
And actually as of
this week, now users

00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:16.000
can opt-in directly
to your open beta test

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.990
on your page in the Play Store.

00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:19.610
Your second option,
if you still want

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:21.650
to keep it in stealth
mode, is to do

00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:22.930
what we call a closed beta.

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:25.990
So in addition to Google
Groups and Google+ communities,

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:29.550
you can also specify a
list of email addresses.

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:32.470
So that allows you to control
only these people get access

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:35.520
to my alpha or beta test.

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:37.800
So by the way, if you
haven't checked out yet,

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:38.900
like that's what
it's actually going

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:40.210
to look like in the Play Store.

00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:42.940
So for all of you who have
a beta test, an open beta

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:44.744
on Play, go check it out.

00:31:44.744 --> 00:31:47.160
And then you may want to update
some of your documentation

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.557
to your beta testers
about how they can opt-in.

00:31:49.557 --> 00:31:51.390
And we think this will
make it a lot easier.

00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:53.810
And also for anyone who
already has your app installed,

00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:56.687
if they happen to peruse your
page in the Play store again,

00:31:56.687 --> 00:31:57.520
they might see this.

00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:59.478
And it will make it a
lot easier for you to get

00:31:59.478 --> 00:32:01.960
more folks in your betas.

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:05.500
Now we mentioned earlier that
when people are in a beta,

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.640
they can't leave
you a review, right?

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.120
Super important.

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:12.740
And for the whole time that
beta testing's been out there,

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:14.490
developers can collect
feedback from users

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:16.250
in a whole range of ways.

00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:19.540
Some people put some sort
of a form in the app itself.

00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:22.220
Others provide an email address
for collecting feedback.

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:25.030
Other people have
a discussion forum.

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:27.390
And we added one new
option this week,

00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:31.150
which is that users will be able
to give you private feedback

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:32.182
through the Play Store.

00:32:32.182 --> 00:32:33.390
So they go to the Play Store.

00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:36.056
And it's in the same place where
they would be leaving a review.

00:32:36.056 --> 00:32:38.134
But it's actually
private feedback.

00:32:38.134 --> 00:32:40.300
So you can see here that
this user in the Play Store

00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:42.860
has provided private
feedback to the developer.

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:44.667
And when you go into
the developer console,

00:32:44.667 --> 00:32:47.000
you'll be able to see the
private beta feedback there as

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:47.510
well.

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:49.220
And again, this is
not shown publicly.

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:54.720
It does not affect your
app's rating in any way.

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:58.100
So back to the earlier point
about going fast and going

00:32:58.100 --> 00:32:58.760
together.

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:00.885
We announced earlier this
week something that we're

00:33:00.885 --> 00:33:02.640
calling Early Access.

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:05.840
And what this is this is a
special place in the Play Store

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.765
where users, early
adopter users, who

00:33:07.765 --> 00:33:09.640
want to try out the
latest and greatest stuff

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:13.090
can go to see apps that
are actually in beta.

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:14.910
And the reason we
launched this was we

00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:16.960
heard from a lot
of startups, wow.

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:18.780
Beta testing sounds great.

00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:20.720
I'd love to get a bunch
of people giving me

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.500
early feedback on my app.

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:23.690
But I'm a startup.

00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:25.180
I don't even have many users.

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:28.430
How could I possibly grow
a group of beta testers?

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:30.620
So what we decided
to do was to identify

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:33.900
some of the most exciting
apps that are out there, many

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:35.400
of them from startups.

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.670
And all of them haven't
really been made publicly

00:33:37.670 --> 00:33:39.890
available on Google Play yet.

00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:42.555
So we handpicked them so
that this way users can

00:33:42.555 --> 00:33:44.430
go there and be sure
that they're finding out

00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:46.638
about really cool stuff
that's actually still working

00:33:46.638 --> 00:33:50.590
pretty well, but be able to get
that feedback to developers,

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:53.660
get developers like you
a bit more exposure,

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:55.760
and to help you be able
to iterate more quickly

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:56.961
and improve your products.

00:33:56.961 --> 00:33:58.460
And this is a great
way that we have

00:33:58.460 --> 00:33:59.830
a huge reach in the Play store.

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:01.329
And we're trying
to put this to work

00:34:01.329 --> 00:34:03.750
for you to help you find
early testers for your apps

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:06.090
and get the feedback that
you folks need to improve

00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:10.030
and get ready for
a broader launch.

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:11.469
OK.

00:34:11.469 --> 00:34:12.219
And then, OK.

00:34:12.219 --> 00:34:13.310
So you have your app.

00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:14.560
You did a beta test.

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:15.679
You got some feedback.

00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:17.022
It's looking pretty good.

00:34:17.022 --> 00:34:18.230
And you're ready to roll out.

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:19.868
So you roll out to everybody.

00:34:19.868 --> 00:34:21.909
And then once you've done
that, the next time you

00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:23.690
want to roll out
a new version, you

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:26.150
can still beta test your
newer versions as well.

00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:28.400
But when you're ready to
put new updates to your app

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.026
out to everybody,
you'll probably

00:34:30.026 --> 00:34:31.734
want to do what we do
at Google, and what

00:34:31.734 --> 00:34:33.260
we see a lot of our
top partners do,

00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:34.820
which is doing a staged rollout.

00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:37.380
So I may not want to roll
out to everyone on day one.

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:39.429
Maybe I just want
to start with 10%.

00:34:39.429 --> 00:34:41.949
Then I'll monitor the
reviews that I'm getting.

00:34:41.949 --> 00:34:44.010
Maybe I'll use
Firebase to monitor

00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:45.501
the crashes that are coming in.

00:34:45.501 --> 00:34:46.500
I'll see how it's doing.

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:50.380
And if I feel confident,
20%, 30%, 50%, and then I'll

00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:51.659
roll it out to everyone.

00:34:51.659 --> 00:34:54.219
And here if there's a major
bug, or if people just really

00:34:54.219 --> 00:34:56.710
don't like the new color scheme
my designer came up with,

00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:58.310
I can halt the rollout.

00:34:58.310 --> 00:35:00.862
I can immediately upload a
new version if I need to.

00:35:00.862 --> 00:35:03.070
And then other people who
didn't have the new version

00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:05.260
yet won't be affected by
any negative issues that

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:07.704
were in my latest update.

00:35:07.704 --> 00:35:09.120
One thing to keep
in mind, though,

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:10.494
when you are in
a staged rollout,

00:35:10.494 --> 00:35:12.340
people can leave reviews.

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:15.369
So be sure it is good
before you start that.

00:35:15.369 --> 00:35:17.160
So another trend we've
seen with developers

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:18.909
is just the amount of
time that all of you

00:35:18.909 --> 00:35:20.839
spend managing your
Play Store reviews.

00:35:20.839 --> 00:35:22.130
So we would talk to developers.

00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:23.171
And they would say, look.

00:35:23.171 --> 00:35:25.070
The more users I get,
the more reviews I get.

00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:25.880
And it's great.

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.520
But I have to have
someone sit there

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:31.000
and read them all the time, and
then try to have that person,

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.960
you know, summarize
back to the team

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:36.570
to understand what are users
like, what are they not like,

00:35:36.570 --> 00:35:38.050
what should we do next.

00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:39.430
And so over the
years, we've been

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:42.630
updating what we have to make
it easier for you to manage.

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:44.660
So one of the unique
things we have

00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:46.230
is that you're
actually able to reply

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:47.466
to reviews on the Play Store.

00:35:47.466 --> 00:35:48.840
Has anyone done
that, by the way?

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:51.000
Anyone replied to a
review on the Play Store?

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.050
Has anyone thought about
it but not done it yet?

00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:55.072
Yeah.

00:35:55.072 --> 00:35:56.030
It's worth considering.

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:59.320
We definitely see that users
who actually update their review

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.660
after receiving a
reply are actually

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:04.380
increasing their review
on average by 0.7 stars.

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:07.540
So it's definitely a good
thing to think about.

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:08.680
So that exists.

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:12.510
We've had search on the reviews,
a whole range of graphs.

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:15.200
We recently rolled out
email notifications

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:19.206
so that if someone updates their
review again, you can find out.

00:36:19.206 --> 00:36:20.580
So all of these
things are to try

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:23.920
to make reviews more friendly
to help you be able to dive

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:26.200
into what's happening
with your reviews

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.809
and how you can
manage them better.

00:36:27.809 --> 00:36:29.975
Because every app that you
get, and every app review

00:36:29.975 --> 00:36:31.170
that you get in the
Play store is really

00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:33.550
an opportunity to have
a one-on-one interaction

00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:34.640
with a customer.

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:37.250
And I know all of you care about
your users as much as we do.

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:39.810
And so having those tools
to be able to talk to them

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:43.400
or understand what's going
on can be so important.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:46.830
So this year what we're
just rolling out now,

00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:48.510
and we announced
at I/O this week,

00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:52.280
is automated ways to be able
to extract more information out

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:53.830
of the reviews for you.

00:36:53.830 --> 00:36:55.530
Because developers
would tell us,

00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:57.456
well, I have to have
someone sit there

00:36:57.456 --> 00:36:59.330
and go through literally
hundreds of reviews.

00:36:59.330 --> 00:36:59.830
Right?

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:00.700
Not that exciting.

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:02.920
And then how does that
person report back?

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:04.980
So we've taken our machine
learning technologies,

00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:07.220
and we're able to
automatically summarize them.

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:08.990
So we're doing a couple things.

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:10.700
First of all, there's
certain topics

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:13.960
that are common across all apps
and we see coming up in reviews

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:14.890
all the time.

00:37:14.890 --> 00:37:18.620
Things like design,
usability, apps stability.

00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:20.550
And so what we're
doing is automatically

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:23.440
identifying any reviews that
cite those sorts of factors.

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:23.940
Right.

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:26.044
Are people talking
about your app crashing?

00:37:26.044 --> 00:37:27.960
You know, we'll be able
to surface that to you

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:30.293
so you can just dive in and
see all the reviews that are

00:37:30.293 --> 00:37:31.780
related to, let's say, crashes.

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:34.416
Or maybe you do a great
new material design layout.

00:37:34.416 --> 00:37:36.290
You can look at all the
feedback about design

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:39.240
to see if users are
liking your new layout.

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:41.480
And then a lot of
developers have asked

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:43.610
us, well, are my reviews good?

00:37:43.610 --> 00:37:44.940
Does my app measure up?

00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:46.690
How do I compare to my peers?

00:37:46.690 --> 00:37:49.060
And so since we're able
to come look at your app

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:52.520
across these common topics
that happen to all apps,

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:55.260
we can now actually tell
you how your app's reviews

00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:58.030
in that particular subject
compare to similar apps.

00:37:58.030 --> 00:38:01.240
So for example, are more people
mentioning crashes in your app

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:02.660
compared to similar apps?

00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:05.820
Are more people mentioning
design, for example?

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:07.660
And then you can also
see what the impact

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:09.000
will be on your rating.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.197
So for example, we
see a lot of people

00:38:11.197 --> 00:38:13.530
if they have a lot of crashes
that users are mentioning,

00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:15.539
that will be dragging
their review down.

00:38:15.539 --> 00:38:17.080
Usually if there's
crashes, it's more

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:18.592
of a one star type of rating.

00:38:18.592 --> 00:38:20.550
But maybe a lot of people
love your new design.

00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:22.716
And you can see that that's
having a positive impact

00:38:22.716 --> 00:38:24.857
and pulling your rating up.

00:38:24.857 --> 00:38:27.190
And so that can be really
helpful so you can understand,

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:29.082
if I want to get my
rating up there, what

00:38:29.082 --> 00:38:31.165
are the aspects that I'm
going to need to address.

00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:34.850
All right.

00:38:34.850 --> 00:38:36.480
I want to go back one.

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:36.980
OK.

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:37.480
I can't.

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:42.200
But the other thing I wanted
to mention about it is-- oh.

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:43.230
That's interesting.

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:44.155
It was magic.

00:38:44.155 --> 00:38:46.280
So the other thing I wanted
to mention about it too

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:48.310
is that in addition to
these common topics,

00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:50.850
your app probably has unique
features about it, right?

00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:52.130
Maybe you have a racing game.

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:53.880
And you have different
types of cars.

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:55.810
Maybe you have a fitness app.

00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:59.710
And you have features like
pre-programmed workouts,

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:03.330
or calorie counters, or
instructional videos.

00:39:03.330 --> 00:39:05.560
And so these unique
features of your app,

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:07.660
we'll also pull them out
with our machine learning

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:09.440
and natural processing as well.

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:11.206
So this way you
can also see, OK,

00:39:11.206 --> 00:39:13.330
if I launched a new feature,
like a new type of car

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:16.450
in my racing game, how often
is that being mentioned?

00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:18.490
And then more importantly,
is that correlated

00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:21.720
with an increase or
decrease in my app's rating?

00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:24.487
So by looking at all
these things together,

00:39:24.487 --> 00:39:26.070
we want to just make
it easier for you

00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:28.445
to see at a glance what people
are saying about your app,

00:39:28.445 --> 00:39:30.130
and also to help you zoom in.

00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:33.060
We hear all the time from
startups, I have so much to do.

00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:34.610
I'm overwhelmed with data.

00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:36.460
Like, just tell me
what I should work on.

00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:38.730
And so we would love to
hear feedback and understand

00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:41.450
if these new reports are
helping you zoom in on what

00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:44.260
it is that you need to do next.

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:45.190
OK.

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:46.080
So you have an app.

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:47.050
You beta tested it.

00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:48.910
Your reviews are
looking pretty good.

00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:52.010
And now what you want to do
is start to go bigger, right?

00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:54.350
And so you want to
build your audience.

00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:56.950
So what we do on Google Play is
we launched the store listing

00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:59.650
experiments feature last year.

00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:02.450
And this is a great way to be
able to optimize your store

00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:02.950
listing.

00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:05.310
You want to know that
it's working well.

00:40:05.310 --> 00:40:07.890
So what we do at Google
is we test everything.

00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:10.750
And we wanted to roll this
out to you guys as well.

00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:12.590
So here are some best
practices with it.

00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:14.530
You want to have a hypothesis.

00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:16.650
You know, is it that
your hypothesis is

00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:21.490
that, your fitness app, people
really like the training video

00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:22.090
capability.

00:40:22.090 --> 00:40:24.740
So you want to emphasize
that, or it's something else.

00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:26.610
And then what you
want to do is to be

00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:28.550
able to run your
different experiments,

00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:31.369
see what the results are, run
it all the way to the end.

00:40:31.369 --> 00:40:32.910
And then a great
thing about startups

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:35.100
is, if your brand isn't
already well-established,

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:37.520
you can be pretty bold
in which what you're

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:38.640
willing to experiment on.

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:39.139
Right?

00:40:39.139 --> 00:40:40.190
A totally new icon?

00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:41.090
Go for it.

00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:44.540
The big changes are what's going
to get you the biggest payoff.

00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:46.150
So here's an
example of how Rovio

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:48.430
was able to use a
series of experiments

00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:50.910
to get up to a pretty
significant increase.

00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:52.429
By running these
experiments, they

00:40:52.429 --> 00:40:54.720
had a double digit improvement
in their conversion rate

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:57.024
on Play.

00:40:57.024 --> 00:40:58.440
And they had a lot
of great things

00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:01.800
to say about how it
impacted their business.

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:04.690
So that brings us to Aviary.

00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:06.620
They are a startup in New York.

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:08.967
They were acquired
by Adobe in 2004.

00:41:08.967 --> 00:41:11.050
And they've been using
some of the iteration tools

00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:12.017
that we just discussed.

00:41:12.017 --> 00:41:13.350
Let's take a look at this video.

00:41:16.009 --> 00:41:16.675
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:41:16.675 --> 00:41:20.000
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:23.800
-I'm Avi Muchnick.

00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:26.510
I'm one of the
co-founders of Aviary.

00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:28.965
There are thousands of photo
editing apps out there.

00:41:28.965 --> 00:41:32.390
We we've always looked to do
is to simplify the experience

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:33.339
for the end user.

00:41:33.339 --> 00:41:35.880
We want something that no matter
what your background in tech

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:37.200
is, you can just
literally pick it up,

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.866
and in less than six
seconds, understand

00:41:38.866 --> 00:41:41.175
how to use it, and make
your photos look great.

00:41:41.175 --> 00:41:43.550
One of the most amazing things
about the Android platform

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:45.280
is our communication
with our users.

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:48.140
It's not really us responding
to bug reports that we see.

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:50.360
It's really this
ongoing two-way dialogue

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:52.480
we have with people,
both through beta tests,

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:54.144
and also through
ratings reviews.

00:41:54.144 --> 00:41:56.310
We can see things as they're
happening in real time.

00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:57.770
We can talk with our
community to find out

00:41:57.770 --> 00:42:00.050
what features they like
and what they don't like,

00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:01.340
and what things they would
love to see in the app

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:03.256
that we haven't even
thought of, and implement

00:42:03.256 --> 00:42:04.010
that in real time.

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:05.930
-Working with the
Android dev console

00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:09.530
has been amazing compared to
other platforms in particular.

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:12.434
With Android, we are able
to see metrics about them.

00:42:12.434 --> 00:42:13.850
We're able to
search through them.

00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:16.060
We're able to actually
respond to users.

00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:18.360
With the new tools, I
would say that we're

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:20.740
able to identify
issues twice as fast.

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:24.120
It makes it easy for us to
search through the reviews,

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:27.090
contact users when we need to,
get more information from them.

00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:28.640
And just in general,
it has saved me

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:31.700
a tremendous amount of time,
anywhere between 5 to 10 hours

00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:33.170
a week.

00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:36.130
-Android in general is hugely
impactful to the Aviary team.

00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:39.030
It's over 2/3 of our user base.

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:41.490
We use Search Within
Reviews every day.

00:42:41.490 --> 00:42:43.560
We use it to validate
new features.

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:45.640
For example, we
recently released

00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:46.940
a new discover feature.

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:48.430
We'll search
Discover to see what

00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:50.840
users are saying about that,
and let us know if they like it,

00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:52.215
or if there are
problems with it.

00:42:52.215 --> 00:42:54.250
And that helps us make
product decisions.

00:42:54.250 --> 00:42:57.470
The ratings and reviews feature
has been immensely impactful.

00:42:57.470 --> 00:43:03.000
Having the ability to quickly
drill into issues by device,

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.670
by app version, by
Android version,

00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:08.860
and then also anecdotally sift
through what users are saying

00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:10.670
and the actual
words they're using

00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:12.270
is pretty unique
to the platform.

00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:15.750
And it helps us develop
much more quickly.

00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:17.890
-Responding to users
in the dev console

00:43:17.890 --> 00:43:20.280
has been immensely
impactful for us.

00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:22.720
For instance, recently
we released a version

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:24.900
that I resolved a pretty
major bug that was

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:26.430
affecting many of our users.

00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:28.245
I went into the dev
console, responded

00:43:28.245 --> 00:43:30.370
to all of the people who
were experiencing the bug,

00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:33.510
and about 50% of them actually
went back and ended up

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:34.700
updating the review.

00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:37.033
-One of the things I love
about building for the Android

00:43:37.033 --> 00:43:40.680
platform is how quickly we
can test and deploy on it.

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:43.320
We have this fantastic
beta community on Android

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:44.970
that can test out new features.

00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:48.460
And that helps us
identify bugs, or what

00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:51.410
features they like or don't
like, much more quickly.

00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:54.420
-Being able to do that allows
us to iterate two to three times

00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:57.800
faster on Android compared
to other platforms, which is

00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:00.460
hugely impactful for our app.

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:02.530
Photo Editor by
Aviary is meant to be

00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:05.150
a dead simple but powerful
photo editing tool.

00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:07.054
Having that dialogue
with our users

00:44:07.054 --> 00:44:09.470
through the tools the Developer
Console and the Play Store

00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:12.150
gives us, we're able
to iterate much faster

00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:15.200
and deliver on an easy
simple interface, which

00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:17.360
is really powerful for us.

ELLIE POWERS: All right.

00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:28.424
Thank you very much.

00:44:28.424 --> 00:44:30.090
It's been great talking
with all of you.

00:44:30.090 --> 00:44:32.300
And we're really
excited to see what

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:33.590
comes up next for all of you.

00:44:33.590 --> 00:44:36.210
I hope also all of you will
download the Play console

00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:37.870
app on Google Play.

00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:40.070
And keep giving us
your feedback about how

00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:41.710
we can get better for startups.

00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:42.260
Thank you.
