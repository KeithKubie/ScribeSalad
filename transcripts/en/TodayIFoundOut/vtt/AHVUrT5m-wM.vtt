00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:32.369
Aluminium or aluminum, zee or zed, and removing
u’s from certain words or not- among the

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.269
many discrepancies between American and British
English, perhaps none conjures as much religious

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:41.410
fervor as math vs. maths.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.790
So which one is correct?

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.969
Well, really neither is technically more correct
than the other.

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.499
It’s all just language and conventions different
groups of people want to use.

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:56.229
At the end of the day, language is all about
communicating effectively and the rules that

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:01.329
surround it are meant to serve that end, not
language serving the rules and conventions,

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.850
contrary to what many an individual who refuses
to accept the evolution of language might

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.740
otherwise try to have you believe.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.069
As nobody is likely to get confused at all
what someone is saying when they say math

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:16.710
or maths and saying one or the other is the
accepted way to do it among two rather large

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.850
groups of English speakers, the idea of saying
one is definitively right and one is wrong

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.310
is a little rich.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.939
But that’s not terribly interesting.

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:29.259
So let’s stoke the fires a bit and see if
we can’t shed some light on how this particular

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.110
difference between American and British English
came to be.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.959
To begin with- which was first, math or maths?

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:40.140
It turns out, while you’ll often read that
the math lovers of the world win this one,

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.759
this isn’t actually correct, though it is
true that even in the UK it’s not been until

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.179
the last half century or so that saying maths
was more common than math.

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:54.099
But to start with, Math. as an abbreviation
for mathematics dates back to at least as

00:01:54.099 --> 00:02:00.830
early as June 4, 1847 where W.G. Hammond wrote
in his diary “It rained so that we had a

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.460
math. lesson indoors.”

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.400
Again, it is commonly stated that Maths is
a later invention, first attested to in 1911

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:13.420
in a letter from English soldier and poet
Wilfred Edward Salter Owen where he wrote,

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.739
“The Answers to Maths.

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.690
Ques. were given us all this morning.”

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.580
It is next seen again after this in 1917 in
a September edition of Wireless World with

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.239
“Extremely ‘rusty’ in ‘maths.'”

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:29.260
However, it turns out there is a much earlier
known instance of someone writing maths, interestingly,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.790
occurring in America.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.279
In his Letter from the Secretary of War written
by War Secretary John C. Calhoun in 1818,

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:37.870
a man referred to as “Chs.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.880
Davies” is listed as “ass. prof. maths.”

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.430
There is also a third variation of this popping
up in 1836, where it states, “Edward C.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.349
Ward, Prof. of Math’s”

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:53.150
“Math’s” also appears in The Merit Roll
of the Cadets of the Virginia Military Institute,

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.420
published sometime around 1854.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.499
It turns out one T.C.

00:02:56.499 --> 00:02:57.499
Rice and P.H.

00:02:57.499 --> 00:03:00.169
Worhsam were, to quote, “Deficient in math’s.”

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:03.629
(No doubt had they known over a century and
a half later they’d be called out on this

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:08.700
in a very public way and it would be all anyone
would ever remember of them, they would have

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.700
studied harder.)

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.359
In any event, in these cases, the apostrophe
simply functions as the placeholder for the

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.239
missing letters between the math and the “s”.

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:21.709
It should be noted here that in all these
early variations of math, maths, math’s,

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.999
it’s not thought people actually pronounced
the abbreviations this way, instead just using

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:31.200
it as a short hand way to write mathematics,
which would then be spoken fully, similar

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.900
to how you’d say “Professor” rather
than “Prof” when encountering the abbreviation

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.659
“Prof.” as in the previous example.

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:42.559
It wouldn’t be until around the mid-20th
century that it appears people actually started

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:47.639
to use math and maths as proper spoken words,
rather than just a written abbreviation.

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:51.010
Unsurprisingly, for no known reason, even
though both were used on either side of the

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.300
pond for a time, the “math” version of
the abbreviation ended up being more popular

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.469
than its plural-sounding “maths” in the
United States, whereas eventually the opposite

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:00.469
was true in the UK.

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:05.090
However, it’s also noteworthy that it wouldn’t
be until around the 1970s that maths would

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.939
overtake math as the proper form in the UK.

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:10.829
Before that, usage was a bit more mixed on
that end of the pond.

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:14.879
This all brings us to the argument often leveled
at the pro-math speakers of the world as the

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:20.160
definitive reason people should say “maths”
and not “math”- that mathematics is plural,

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.510
thus its abbreviation should be.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.000
Beyond the tenuous supposition that an abbreviation
of something plural must inherently also be

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.680
in plural form, those who say “maths”
don’t say “My favourite subjects are maths.”

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.530
They say, “My favourite subject is maths.”

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.110
Similarly, there is no such thing as a “mathematic”
to have more than one of.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.759
(Or, at least, not anymore- at one point mathematic
was more or less used to describe a polymath.)

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:48.740
But the main point being that mathematics
is not a counting noun.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.210
While you might say, “I have two mathematics
classes,” you’d never say, “I have two

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.210
mathematics.”

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.349
There is just the broad field of study known
as mathematics, similar to how we have physics,

00:04:58.349 --> 00:04:59.970
linguistics, economics.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.139
In these latter cases, nobody says “econs”
or “lings” if they are going to shorten

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:06.460
the words; they say “econ” and “ling”.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.650
(Physics is another beast altogether as, to
our knowledge, nobody verbally abbreviates

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:11.650
it.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.300
And even if it was Phys, it wouldn’t be
clear whether the person was contracting the

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.360
ending s or simply including the fourth letter.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.590
Though perhaps we really should pronounce
this abbreviation as “Fizz” is a rather

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.020
appealing name for a field of science.)

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.400
Despite all this, particularly when querying
humans of the British persuasion, folk-etymology

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.480
tends to lead said individuals to assume that,
despite their own usage demonstrating the

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.699
contrary, mathematics must be plural because
of the trailing s.

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:43.750
It may even be that this idea is the reason
the s was originally tacked on at the end

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.810
of the abbreviation in the first place, with
some individuals thinking mathematics was

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.520
plural, despite common usage.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.710
There is some evidence in support of this
where around the time these abbreviations

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.710
started to pop up, you’ll find a few instances
of people actually treating mathematics as

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:58.710
plural.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.000
For example, in Baldwin and Cradock’s Library
of Useful Knowledge- Mathematics, publishing

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.250
in 1836, they say “Now the mathematics are
peculiarly well adapted for this purpose…”

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:12.259
In truth, mathematics is simply a mass noun
(like music, water, faculty, garbage, furniture,

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:17.039
evidence, humanity, luggage) that has an ‘s’
on the end, similar to physics or economics

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:21.479
and, again, is considered uncountable and
generally treated as singular in the way its

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:22.479
used.

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:25.280
(Although, it is noteworthy that some mass
nouns that refer to a group of some thing,

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.939
like faculty, can go either way in usage-
for instance, “The media is sensationalizing

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:30.939
the news.”

00:06:30.939 --> 00:06:32.969
Or “The media are sensationalizing the news.”)

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:36.860
But unfortunately for the “mathematics is
plural” crowd, other than a few isolated

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.270
instances in very recent times (likely stemming
from the misconception that mathematics is

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:46.639
plural), it’s long been the case that mathematics
has been almost universally treated as singular

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:47.789
in common usage.

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:51.470
You might at this point be wondering if mathematics
is not plural, how did that “s” get there

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:52.470
in the first place?

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:56.830
While there is some debate here, this seems
to have come about owing to a common convention

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:01.539
around the time mathematics popped into English
where it was en vogue to use a plural name

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:06.490
for different fields of study, such as economics,
linguistics, physics, acoustics, etc.

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:10.730
This practice seems to have been adopted borrowing
from the related terms in Ancient Greek, like

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.759
physika or, in this case, mathematika.

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:17.330
But at the end of the day, both math and maths
are just abbreviations for mathematics that

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:22.360
turned into proper words, with some choosing
to go with the contracted version of the abbreviation

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:27.490
instead of the shorter “math” and it just
sort of catching on one way or the other from

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:28.490
there.

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.800
Neither math nor maths is more correct than
the other in the general case, though if you

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.969
happen to be writing for an audience that
you know predominantly uses maths, you should

00:07:35.969 --> 00:07:40.389
probably go with that, and vice versa, unless
you’re just one of those people who like

00:07:40.389 --> 00:07:41.990
to watch the world burn.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:46.889
And either way- god help you if you’re a
British person working with many American

00:07:46.889 --> 00:07:51.250
script writers and talking to a world-wide
audience on a platform particularly known

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.280
for commenters with no filter…

00:07:54.280 --> 00:08:56.910
The problem of math vs. maths is just the
tip of the iceberg

00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:12.660
for

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:52.820
that

00:09:52.820 --> 00:10:01.370
sorry individual.
