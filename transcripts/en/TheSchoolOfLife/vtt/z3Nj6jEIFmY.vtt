00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:06.490
‘Atonement’ is a slightly unfamiliar,
old-fashioned and alien word. It means, according

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:12.639
to the dictionary, the action of making amends
for a wrong or injury and, especially in religious

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:19.390
contexts, reparation or expiation for sin.
The modern world chiefly believes that the

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:26.380
rightful way to amend for a wrong is either
to pay a fine or go to prison. These are,

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.080
in certain circumstances, surely the best
moves – but they fail to deal with what

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.010
is in the end the far largest category of
wrongs that humans commit: instances of everyday

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.420
nastiness, error, foolishness, lack of empathy
and shortsightedness. Fining or imprisoning

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.210
on a mass scale is not realistic here and
yet, leaving the wrongs unaddressed seems

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:55.350
not quite right either. We need a procedure
for atonement that is both real and functions

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.850
outside of the judicial system. Here, as in
so many areas, we can be inspired by the example

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.549
of religion, and in particular Judaism. It
has been the particular insight of Judaism

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:13.920
to focus on hurt: how easy it is to feel it,
how hard it is to express it and how awkward

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.729
but also necessary it is to make amends for
perpetrating it. We find the religion’s

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.620
response in what is known as the Day of Atonement,
one of the most psychologically effective

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:31.719
mechanisms ever devised for the resolution
of social conflict. Falling on the tenth day

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:36.249
of Tishrei, shortly after the beginning of
the Jewish new year, the Day of Atonement

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:42.170
(or Yom Kippur) is a solemn and critical event
in the Hebrew Calendar. Leviticus instructs

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.450
that on this date, Jews must set aside their
usual family and commercial activities and

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.659
mentally review their actions over the preceding
year, identifying all those whom they have

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:59.020
caused pain to or behaved unjustly towards.
Together in synagogue, they must repeat in

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.229
prayer:
We have sinned, we have acted treacherously,

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.740
We have robbed, we have spoken slander.
We have acted perversely, we have acted wickedly,

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.060
We have acted presumptuously, we have been
violent, we have framed lies. They must then

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.450
seek out those whom they have frustrated,
angered, discarded casually or otherwise betrayed

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.820
and offer them their fullest contrition. This
is God’s will as is the requirement for

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.940
forgiveness, so long as the apology is real.
‘All the people are in fault’, says the

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.900
evening prayer, and so ‘may all the people
of Israel be forgiven, including all the strangers

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.120
who live in their midst.’ On the Day of
Atonement, Jews are advised to contact their

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.510
colleagues, sit down with their parents and
children and send letters to acquaintances,

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.520
lovers and ex-friends overseas, and to catalogue
their relevant moments of temper, infidelity,

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.290
cowardice and greed. In turn, those to whom
they apologise are urged to recognise the

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.070
sincerity and effort which the offender has
invested in asking for their forgiveness.

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:09.250
Rather than let annoyance and bitterness towards
their petitioner well up in them once more,

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.600
they must be ready to draw a line under past
incidents, aware that their own lives have

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:22.270
surely also not been free of fault. God enjoys
a privileged role in this cycle of apology:

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.830
he is the only perfect being and therefore
the only one to whom the need to apologise

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:34.280
is alien. As for everyone else, imperfection
is embedded in human nature, and therefore

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.940
so too must be the will to contrition.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.500
The prescriptions of the Day of Atonement

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.400
bring comfort to both parties to an injury:
as victims of hurt, we frequently don’t

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.520
bring up what ails us, because so many wounds
look absurd, small or strange in the light

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:56.120
of day. Our vulnerability insults our self-conception;
we are in pain and at the same time offended

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.300
that we could so easily be so. Alternatively,
when we are the ones who have caused someone

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.830
else pain, and yet failed to offer apology,
it was perhaps because acting badly made us

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:13.430
feel intolerably guilty. We can be so sorry
that we find ourselves incapable of saying

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.789
sorry. We run away from our victims and act
with strange rudenness towards them, not because

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:22.669
we aren’t bothered by what we did, but because
what we did makes us feel uncomfortable with

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:28.080
an unmanageable intensity. Our victims hence
have to suffer not only the original hurt,

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:34.620
but also the subsequent coldness we display
towards them on account of our tormented consciences.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.280
All this a Day of Atonement helps to correct.
A period in which human error is proclaimed

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:46.620
as a general truth makes it easier to confess
to specific infractions. It is more bearable

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.319
to own up to our follies when the highest
authority has told us that we are all childishly

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:59.150
yet ultimately forgiveably demented to begin
with. The secular world needs to learn from

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.360
the Day of Atonement. Functioning without
a culture of atonement implies that we are

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.849
perfect, or that our imperfections are only
things that a court of law can handle or that

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:15.810
no one can be forgiven if they are sorry.
In fact, we are of course deeply imperfect,

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.860
courts can’t handle every occasion of nastiness
and we can’t ever progress and live together

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:27.470
in society if we can’t regularly offer and
accept an apology. We need to learn, from

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:32.639
the best sides of religion, how regularly
to confess to foolishness and forgive it in

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.100
ourselves 
and others.
