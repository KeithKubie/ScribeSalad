00:00:00.121 --> 00:00:02.171
We know that if we take all of the points

00:00:02.171 --> 00:00:08.104
in the *X, Y plane&lt;i&gt;where&lt;/i&gt;x^2 + y^2 = 1*,

00:00:08.104 --> 00:00:10.913
we get ourselves the unit circle.

00:00:10.913 --> 00:00:13.247
Let me draw the unit circle.

00:00:13.247 --> 00:00:18.997
That's my &lt;i&gt;y-axis&lt;/i&gt;; this is my &lt;i&gt;x-axis&lt;/i&gt;.

00:00:18.997 --> 00:00:22.831
And the unit circle has the circle with the radius one.

00:00:22.831 --> 00:00:30.971
So that's &lt;i&gt;x=1&lt;/i&gt;, that's &lt;i&gt;x=-1&lt;/i&gt;, that's &lt;i&gt;y=1&lt;/i&gt;, that's &lt;i&gt;y=-1&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:30.971 --> 00:00:34.503
the unit circle looks something... let me draw it...

00:00:34.503 --> 00:00:35.997
something like this, I think you get the point

00:00:35.997 --> 00:00:39.103
Let's see if I can fill it in a little bit better.

00:00:39.103 --> 00:00:41.564
So you realize that it's not a dotted circle.

00:00:41.564 --> 00:00:43.170
There.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.438
That's my best attempt at drawing the unit circle.

00:00:47.438 --> 00:00:51.081
And we also know that the traditional trig functions,

00:00:51.081 --> 00:00:54.080
or maybe we should call them the &lt;i&gt;circular&lt;/i&gt; trig functions

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.504
are actually defined so that if you parameterize

00:00:58.504 --> 00:01:03.703
so if you were to take *x=cos t*

00:01:03.703 --> 00:01:07.413
and *y=sin t*

00:01:07.413 --> 00:01:10.372
and you pick any &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;, right over here

00:01:10.372 --> 00:01:13.838
and by definition it's going to sit on the unit circle

00:01:13.838 --> 00:01:18.438
by definition, *x^2 + y^2 = 1*

00:01:18.438 --> 00:01:21.556
so if you pick any &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; it's going to sit some place

00:01:21.571 --> 00:01:22.238
on this unit circle.

00:01:22.238 --> 00:01:24.532
Or another way to think of it is

00:01:24.532 --> 00:01:27.771
if you vary &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; it's going to start tracing out this circle

00:01:27.771 --> 00:01:31.329
And we know that &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; corresponds to the angle

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:34.913
with a positive &lt;i&gt;x-axis&lt;/i&gt;, in this case,

00:01:34.913 --> 00:01:37.246
that right over there is &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;.

00:01:37.246 --> 00:01:40.080
Now wouldn't it be neat if there were a similar

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.914
analogy for, not the unit circle, but

00:01:42.914 --> 00:01:45.170
something we could call the unit hyperbola?

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.581
So that's our little review of trigonometry right there;

00:01:49.581 --> 00:01:51.582
our traditional trigonometry, now let's think about

00:01:51.582 --> 00:01:53.830
the unit &lt;i&gt;hyperbola&lt;/i&gt;.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.771
Well, *x^2 + y^2 = 1* is a unit circle, I'll say that

00:01:57.771 --> 00:02:07.771
*x^2 - y^2 = 1&lt;i&gt;, I'm going to call this my&lt;/i&gt;unit hyperbola*.

00:02:07.771 --> 00:02:12.248
Or a unit rectangular hyperbola. &lt;u&gt;Hyperbola&lt;/u&gt;.

00:02:12.248 --> 00:02:15.171
This is just a little bit of review from *Conic Sections*,

00:02:15.171 --> 00:02:16.970
but it would look something like this:

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:28.170
It would look... something... that's my &lt;i&gt;y-axis&lt;/i&gt;,

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.838
this is my &lt;i&gt;x-axis&lt;/i&gt;, and then we can say,

00:02:33.838 --> 00:02:36.771
well if &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; is 0, &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; can be ±1,

00:02:36.771 --> 00:02:40.246
so you can think of that as the unit part

00:02:40.246 --> 00:02:45.369
where it intersects the &lt;i&gt;x-axis&lt;/i&gt;; that's +1, that's -1

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:48.704
and it has asymptotes, &lt;i&gt;y=x&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;y=-x&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:48.704 --> 00:02:52.039
We go through the intuition on that in the

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:58.413
Conic Section videos, &lt;i&gt;y=x&lt;/i&gt; is that dotted line,

00:02:58.413 --> 00:03:04.611
&lt;i&gt;y=-x&lt;/i&gt; is that dotted line, right over there,

00:03:04.611 --> 00:03:08.079
and then this thing is going to look like this.

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.503
It's going to have a right half that does something like this,

00:03:11.503 --> 00:03:14.103
and does something like this, all a review of

00:03:14.103 --> 00:03:18.039
*Conic Sections*, it gets closer to its asymptotes.

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:22.039
To &lt;i&gt;y=x&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;y=-x&lt;/i&gt;

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:23.663
and the same thing on the left-hand side.

00:03:23.663 --> 00:03:28.837
It's going to do something like that.

00:03:28.837 --> 00:03:33.837
Wouldn't it be neat if we could parameterize

00:03:33.837 --> 00:03:39.703
&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; with analogous functions so that

00:03:39.703 --> 00:03:42.170
we get a similar type of property?

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.569
And you might guess what those functions are,

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:46.036
but let's actually try to verify it.

00:03:46.036 --> 00:03:53.330
What would happen if &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; is equal to our &lt;i&gt;hyperbolic&lt;/i&gt;

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.104
*cosine of t*, which is the same thing as

00:03:57.104 --> 00:04:05.504
*e^t + e^(-t)*, all of that over 2

00:04:05.504 --> 00:04:07.504
and &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; were to be equal to

00:04:07.504 --> 00:04:11.580
*hyperbolic sine* of &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;, which is equal to

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:17.247
*e^t - e^(-t)* over 2. Wouldn't it be neat if there

00:04:17.247 --> 00:04:21.848
were an analogy here; over here you pick any &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;

00:04:21.848 --> 00:04:26.247
based on our circular trig functions, you ended up

00:04:26.247 --> 00:04:29.413
with a point on the unit circle. Wouldn't it be amazing

00:04:29.413 --> 00:04:31.663
if for any point &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; you ended up with a point on our,

00:04:31.663 --> 00:04:34.504
what we're calling our *unit hyperbola*?

00:04:34.504 --> 00:04:37.503
Well, in order for that to be true, with this parameterization

00:04:37.503 --> 00:04:40.704
*x^2 - y^2* would need to be equal to one.

00:04:40.704 --> 00:04:42.438
Let's see if that &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the case!

00:04:42.438 --> 00:04:52.172
So *x^2 - y^2* is equal to, well let's square this business

00:04:52.172 --> 00:04:55.772
it's equal to &lt;i&gt;e^(2t)&lt;/i&gt; plus

00:04:55.772 --> 00:04:58.105
two times the product of these two things

00:04:58.105 --> 00:05:05.313
*2e^t • e^(-t)*, this is &lt;i&gt;e^0&lt;/i&gt; here which is 1.

00:05:05.313 --> 00:05:13.171
Plus &lt;i&gt;e^(-2t)&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;e^(-t)^2&lt;/i&gt;, all of that over 4

00:05:13.171 --> 00:05:15.979
And then from that we will subtract &lt;i&gt;y^2&lt;/i&gt;.

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:20.838
Minus, so the numerator's going to be

00:05:20.838 --> 00:05:35.730
*e^(2t) - 2e^t • e^(-t) + e^(-2t)*, all of that over 4

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.571
So, immediately, a couple of simplifications here.

00:05:39.571 --> 00:05:44.838
*e^t • e^(-t)*, that's just &lt;i&gt;e^(t-t)&lt;/i&gt;

00:05:44.838 --> 00:05:48.064
which is equal to &lt;i&gt;e^0&lt;/i&gt;, which is equal to 1

00:05:48.064 --> 00:05:51.396
This is going to be one, that's going to be one,

00:05:51.396 --> 00:05:54.439
so we're going to have a 2 in either of those cases

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:57.902
and if we were to simplify it, all of this stuff over here

00:05:57.902 --> 00:06:01.440
I'll do a numerator, so this is going to be equal to

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.372
over our [denominator] of 4

00:06:05.372 --> 00:06:19.146
*e^(2t) + 2 + e^(-2t) - e^(2t)*

00:06:19.146 --> 00:06:19.646
just distributing the negative sign

00:06:19.646 --> 00:06:26.099
Plus two, and then minus &lt;i&gt;e^(-2t)&lt;/i&gt;

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:30.103
Well this is convenient!

00:06:30.103 --> 00:06:33.302
(Oh, I was writing it in black, a hard color to see)

00:06:33.302 --> 00:06:39.104
This cancels with this,

00:06:39.104 --> 00:06:42.104
This and this also add up to zero and you're left with

00:06:42.104 --> 00:06:43.396
two plus two over four

00:06:43.396 --> 00:06:47.969
which is indeed equal to one!

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:51.565
So this is a pretty good reason to call these two functions

00:06:51.657 --> 00:06:53.889
hyperbolic trig functions.

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:55.588
These are the circular trig functions,

00:06:55.588 --> 00:06:57.238
you give me a &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; on these parameterizations

00:06:57.238 --> 00:06:58.313
we end up on the unit circle!

00:06:58.313 --> 00:07:00.897
You vary &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;, you trace out the unit circle.

00:07:00.897 --> 00:07:04.570
Here, for any real &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;, we're going to assume we're

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:05.647
dealing with real numbers,

00:07:05.647 --> 00:07:08.238
for any real &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; we're going to end up on

00:07:08.238 --> 00:07:11.480
the unit hyperbola right over here

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.370
and in particular we're going to end up on the right

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:17.063
so it's not exactly... over here pretty much &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; of these

00:07:17.063 --> 00:07:18.646
points could be parameterized right here

00:07:18.646 --> 00:07:20.656
over here we're going to end up

00:07:20.656 --> 00:07:22.572
on a point on the &lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt; side of the unit hyperbola.

00:07:22.572 --> 00:07:23.982
The reason why it's the right side

00:07:23.982 --> 00:07:26.171
is... you go straight to the definition of

00:07:26.171 --> 00:07:29.504
*cosh t*, this thing can only be positive

00:07:29.504 --> 00:07:32.313
This thing can only be positive.

00:07:32.313 --> 00:07:35.646
&lt;i&gt;e^t&lt;/i&gt; can only be positive, &lt;i&gt;e^-t&lt;/i&gt; can only be positive

00:07:35.646 --> 00:07:41.171
so this is only positive.

00:07:41.171 --> 00:07:44.312
But you give any &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; you will end up on this hyperbola!

00:07:44.312 --> 00:07:46.770
Specifically the right side, if you want points on

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:48.638
the left hand side, you'd have to take the

00:07:48.638 --> 00:07:55.646
*-cosh t&lt;i&gt;and the&lt;/i&gt;sinh t*

00:07:55.646 --> 00:07:56.771
to end up right over there.

00:07:56.771 --> 00:08:00.238
But it's a pretty neat analogy.

00:08:00.238 --> 00:08:01.397
We're looking at Euler's identity and we

00:08:01.397 --> 00:08:04.396
kind of said, "oh, let's just start playing with these things!"

00:08:04.396 --> 00:08:07.312
There seems to be a similarity here if we were to

00:08:07.312 --> 00:08:09.063
remove the &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt; 's and, all of a sudden, we've discovered

00:08:09.063 --> 00:08:11.314
another thing! That there is this relationship

00:08:11.314 --> 00:08:13.838
here there is this relationship between &lt;i&gt;these&lt;/i&gt; trig functions

00:08:13.838 --> 00:08:17.904
and the unit circle, here between our &lt;i&gt;newly&lt;/i&gt; defined

00:08:17.904 --> 00:08:21.771
hyperbolic trig functions and the unit &lt;u&gt;hyperbola&lt;/u&gt;.

00:08:21.771 --> 00:08:24.239
And you'd also find if you were to vary &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; it's going

00:08:24.239 --> 00:08:26.731
to trace out... just as if you were to vary &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; here it

00:08:26.731 --> 00:08:29.297
traces out the unit circle... if you trace &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; here it will trace

00:08:29.297 --> 00:08:32.561
out the right-hand side, the right-hand side

00:08:32.561 --> 00:08:34.172
of the unit hyperbola.

00:08:34.172 --> 00:08:37.067
For this parameterization right here.
