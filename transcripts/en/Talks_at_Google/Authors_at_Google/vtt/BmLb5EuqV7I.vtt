00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:03.050
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: All right.

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.950
So, I have a little bit of an introduction
to make and I will be reading most of it.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.670
So, we are pleased to welcome Anand Giridharadas.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:09.970
I hope I'm pronouncing that right.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:10.970
I'm sure I'm not.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.990
&gt;&gt;Anand Giridharadas: If you can't get it
right, nobody can get it right.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.990
[laughter]

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.770
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: to the Authors at Google
program.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.410
Anand is an author, columnist, writing about
a world in transition.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.029
He's the author of "India Calling," which
you all see before you.

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.560
And it's about returning to the India his
parents left.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.870
He writes the "Currents" column for the New
York Times and its global edition, and the

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.559
International Herald Tribune and also writes
for the New York Times magazine.

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:42.890
He's reported from India, China, Norway, Haiti,
Brazil, Columbia, Nigeria, and the United

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:43.890
States.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.690
Born in Cleveland, he was raised there and
in Paris and outside of Washington, DC.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.670
And he was educated at the University of Michigan,
Oxford, and Harvard.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.089
He's a former consultant for McKinsey and
later reported from Bombay for the Herald

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:00.579
Tribune and the Times for four and a half
years.

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.300
He wrote about India's transformation, Bollywood,
corporate takeovers, terrorism, outsourcing,

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.410
poverty, and democracy.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.920
And I just, to add a personal note, I was
in India for two years also.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.400
I'm also Indian American.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.329
Born here of Indian heritage.

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:17.840
And I was part of a fellowship with 20 other
Indian Americans.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.840
And we read Anand's New York Times columns
whenever they came out.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.920
And they felt like he was speaking as one
of us.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.710
And that's a large part of the reason why
I've decided to bring him here.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.700
And finally, he's appeared regularly on television
and the radio in the United States, internationally,

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.290
including on CNN, MSNBC, NPR, The Daily Show,
and other forums.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.090
And he's lectured at Harvard, Stanford, the
University of Michigan, Sydney Opera House,

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.660
United Nations, the Asia Society, PopTech,
and Google.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:56.320
I'm pleased to welcome Anand.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.650
[applause]

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.321
&gt;&gt;Anand Giridharadas: Thank you.

00:02:00.321 --> 00:02:05.150
Thank you for that introduction--an abundant
introduction, overabundant.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.090
I have to say, my appearance at Google, which
you mentioned, does not include today's.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:16.090
So, this is the second appearance at Google.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.980
Thank you for having me, but I have to start
by telling you that I mean it when I say that

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.020
Google completes me.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.850
Without your maps, I wouldn't have been able
to get here today.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.230
Without your Gmail, I wouldn't have gotten
the note inviting me to be here today.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.810
Without your calendar, I wouldn't have known
it was Friday.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.530
And frankly, I sometimes use Google Instant
to remind myself of the spelling of my last

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:43.750
name.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.440
So, Google is very, very important to me in
a number of ways.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.440
You invited me here, I suspect, because of
a book that I wrote that's on your chairs.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.560
But today, I'm not gonna speak directly about
that book.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:04.470
Instead, I'm gonna speak more generally about
the vocation of writing in these strange,

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.340
exhilarating times of ours.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.840
I'm gonna put forward some reflections, some
tentative first steps at what is coming to

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:21.569
mean to be a writer in this world that you
at Google are working to rewire and remake.

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:27.240
In short, I'm gonna meditate aloud with you
on the proper place for the writer in ever

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.349
more digital times.

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:33.900
And what feels more and more like a tweeter's
world.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.000
And I raise these questions for a particular
reason.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.040
The world of writing and the world of technology
need each other.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:49.560
We'd have nothing to read on our devices without
the people who bear witness to our times and

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.950
string words together for a living.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.320
And those people will have no living to make
if they don't figure out how to write for

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.740
a world in digital upheaval.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.170
But the world of writing and the world of
technology often find themselves in a kind

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.570
of conflict.

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:14.239
Our lives are increasingly defined by the
assumptions, the values, the rhythms of digital

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:15.239
life.

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:20.389
But those assumptions, values, and rhythms
are in many ways in tension with the writing

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:21.459
life.

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:28.069
Today, I want to speak about three features
of the universe that you, here at Google,

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:30.660
are building.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.780
Each of these, I would suggest, poses a challenge
to the traditional idea of what a writer is.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.930
I wanna explore with you each of these tensions.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:47.150
And then to ask, what of the writer's role
should persist despite these changes?

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.990
And what must adapt?

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:54.460
So, what are these three features of what
we may call "the Googley world?"

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.539
My sister once worked here, so I know the
inside lingo like that.

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:06.919
The three features I wanna talk about today
of your world are, among others, instantaneousness,

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.569
feedback, and openness.

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:14.870
Now, I've chosen these words almost self-consciously
as corporate buzz words.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.539
I'm sure every one of you could pull out your
phone and find within the last two emails

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:22.310
you've received, some variant of each of those
three words.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.460
They are, you might say, the clichÃ©s of the
Googley world.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.309
But what I wanna suggest today is that these
words, commonplace as they are, harmless as

00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:39.180
they seem, pose a challenge to our customary
understanding of what a writer does and is.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.839
Let's start with instantaneousness.

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:46.719
Not long ago, some of you might have even
been part of this, Google came up with the

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:50.069
notion of finishing our searches for us.

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:52.280
You called it instant.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.630
It was a very apt technology for our times
and fitting for a company that bothers to

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:05.219
tell me that it took only point three six
seconds to fetch me those 203 million results.

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:10.189
A contemporary innovation was the second coming
of the iPad.

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:15.919
That machine's most celebrated improvement
over the first one was that glorious new cover

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:21.939
that removed five point one seconds--unbearable
seconds--from the process of getting the tablet

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:24.599
going.

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:27.770
This is an instantaneous age.

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:34.279
And velocity has achieved a moral status once
reserved for things like fidelity and chastity.

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:38.020
It goes far beyond Google and the iPad, of
course.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:44.680
In an instantaneous age, our cable TV pundits
must respond at once to every minor happening

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.619
in American life.

00:06:46.619 --> 00:06:47.960
We must watch the Super Bowl.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:53.339
And instead of waiting for tomorrow's water
cooler reviews of the ads, simultaneously

00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:59.379
keep our eyes on a second device full of hash-tagged
chatter about what is happening on the first

00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:00.949
device.

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:04.629
Photos from a party must be uploaded now,
at 3AM.

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:07.220
Otherwise, it's like your party never happened.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:11.879
Journalists no longer have the daily deadline
at 5PM.

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:17.860
They file throughout the day for the web,
maybe once an hour.

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:22.789
This instantaneous culture can be hard on
the writer, whether the novelist or the White

00:07:22.789 --> 00:07:26.069
House reporter, or the literary critic.

00:07:26.069 --> 00:07:31.979
The overwhelming pressure of this culture
is to burp out the thought that you have right

00:07:31.979 --> 00:07:38.449
now, regardless of how good it is, regardless
of how it relates to your other thoughts,

00:07:38.449 --> 00:07:43.180
regardless of whether it is a thought better
sowed in the fields of the mind, left to take

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:50.749
root unseen, harvested only when its time
has come and it has grown into true insight.

00:07:50.749 --> 00:07:55.710
Of course, the writer can opt out, can withdraw
from Facebook, withdraw from Twitter.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:59.580
I should say withdraw from Google+.

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:03.990
Perhaps turn on that wonderful program called
freedom, which liberates you from the connectivity

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:07.439
that Google works so hard to spread.

00:08:07.439 --> 00:08:13.259
But such is our present culture that withdrawing
can be confused with non-existence.

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:19.039
Not to offer these easy reactions, not to
lend these breezy thoughts, is almost to declare

00:08:19.039 --> 00:08:22.179
I was in my time, but not of it.

00:08:22.179 --> 00:08:27.139
I learned something about this when I had
the chance to interview one of my literary

00:08:27.139 --> 00:08:30.449
heroes, the writer, VS Naipaul.

00:08:30.449 --> 00:08:35.279
I filled a notebook with questions--some about
his books, some about his life.

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:38.120
But many about the planet that we shared.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:42.699
I wanted to take his mind, in the short time
that I had with him, and stretch it to apply

00:08:42.699 --> 00:08:47.170
it to these vexing questions of our age.

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:54.290
But he loathed these big questions, these
prompts for punditry and off-the-cuff analysis.

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:57.430
I asked how his convictions had changed over
the years.

00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:00.620
He answered, "That's writing my books all
over again.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.819
It's too big a question."

00:09:02.819 --> 00:09:06.750
I asked how his idea of the good society had
evolved.

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:09.389
He answered, "I haven't worked it out like
that."

00:09:09.389 --> 00:09:14.509
Narrowing it down a bit, I asked whether he
had come to love England, where he settled

00:09:14.509 --> 00:09:16.430
after leaving Trinidad.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.920
He answered, "That's a provocative question.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.740
I wouldn't answer it."

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.839
I asked about all the talk of the decline
of the West.

00:09:24.839 --> 00:09:29.079
He answered, "I haven't thought of that idea."

00:09:29.079 --> 00:09:32.500
Since this Nobel Laureate seemed not to have
thought about any of the things that I was

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:37.380
thinking about, I asked him what ideas he
had been thinking about, what questions he

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.630
most wanted to answer.

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:41.620
He answered, "I will know later.

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:43.570
I can't tell you now.

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:46.750
Not because of secrecy, but because I have
to find out."

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:55.240
Now, VS Naipaul, for those of you who've read
him, is a famously cantankerous man.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:59.670
He is a man who revels in his own cantankerousness.

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:01.410
But something more was at work here.

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:07.930
The more we spoke, the more I realized that
Naipaul was defending a certain idea of writing

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:11.970
that was at war with the culture of instantaneousness.

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:14.440
Let me quote what he told me a bit later.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.610
Quote, there are two ways of talking.

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:20.769
One is the easy way where you talk lightly.

00:10:20.769 --> 00:10:23.250
And the other is the considered way.

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:26.410
The considered way is what I have put my name
to.

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:31.350
I wouldn't put my name to the easy thoughts
because you can often have outrageous views,

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:35.990
passionate views, and that's the source of
your thoughts eventually.

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:39.190
But when they occur, they are very rough and
brutal.

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:44.810
And so, a lot of writer's time is spent in
working out or refining coarse thought.

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.730
End quote.

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:52.680
As I say this today, I cannot help but think
of my fallen colleague, Anthony Shadid, who

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:56.029
died yesterday in Syria.

00:10:56.029 --> 00:11:00.069
One of the finest journalists of our era.

00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:05.860
As his old colleague, the columnist Mike Barnicle
from Boston, put it on television this morning,

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:11.149
and I'm paraphrasing, "Anthony didn't tweet,
he reported.

00:11:11.149 --> 00:11:13.160
He listened to the people in the field.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:19.640
And then he thought about what they said before
writing it."

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.010
This ethic is worth remembering in these new
times.

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:29.060
The question we must wrestle with is, how
do we preserve the act of writing as the refining

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:35.980
of coarse thought in a culture that is so
voracious for our easy thoughts?

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:45.160
Now, a second important feature of the world
you are building is feedback.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:53.610
As much as by rapidity, this new universe,
the Google universe, is defined by feedback--loops

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:55.080
and loops of it.

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.269
Big data.

00:11:56.269 --> 00:12:00.779
Advertisements that are continually refined,
minute by minute, based on who is searching

00:12:00.779 --> 00:12:07.160
what, who is clicking what, a world that constantly
adapts to us, responds to us, learns from

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.579
the last time.

00:12:09.579 --> 00:12:13.420
For the writer, there is no seduction greater
than that of feedback.

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:17.379
Find me the writer who doesn't live to know
what you think of the sentence she'd just

00:12:17.379 --> 00:12:20.339
written.

00:12:20.339 --> 00:12:25.389
But that same writer will invariably tell
you that she has a complicated relationship

00:12:25.389 --> 00:12:27.050
with feedback.

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:29.529
She pines for it on the one hand.

00:12:29.529 --> 00:12:35.970
On the other, she knows that her art requires
removing herself from feedback for a time

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:42.240
to go deep and go long and go into the creative
wilds to let her mind roam free.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.709
And then, only when it's time to return to
the world and be judged.

00:12:46.709 --> 00:12:49.460
With no judgment at all, her art would die.

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:55.509
But with judgment always on, it may never
reach the level of art.

00:12:55.509 --> 00:13:01.100
But feedback everywhere beckons to the writer
today, from the Amazon sales rank to the most

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:05.660
emailed list, from the Twitter account to
the news room memos that tell the staff who

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.190
is winning the page view war.

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:12.680
The writer knows how she's doing almost as
she does it.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:17.459
We speak of standardized tests impelling teachers
to teach to the test.

00:13:17.459 --> 00:13:22.509
Well, rankings and rating impel writers to
write to the ranking.

00:13:22.509 --> 00:13:28.509
Yet, it's a temptation that many writers will
tell you undermines their craft.

00:13:28.509 --> 00:13:32.160
But here, too, there is no turning back the
clock, nor should there be.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.829
We live now in a feedback world.

00:13:34.829 --> 00:13:36.079
The writer will have to adapt.

00:13:36.079 --> 00:13:42.879
How, though, can she seize these benefits,
be part of the interactive responsive world,

00:13:42.879 --> 00:13:50.370
without losing her craft to the creative suffocation
of pandering?

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:54.529
A third feature of our digital life is openness.

00:13:54.529 --> 00:13:58.600
How many of you would declare yourselves to
be against openness?

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.060
No takers.

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:04.329
Openness is big these days, particularly here.

00:14:04.329 --> 00:14:10.720
Open source software, an open encyclopedia
that anybody can read, write, and edit.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:14.790
Open publishing so you can bring out your
own books without a publisher.

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:19.339
Open sourcing of the news such that CNN, which
used to only report to us, now asks us to

00:14:19.339 --> 00:14:22.390
report for them.

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:26.649
The fetish of openness even extends to the
kitchens of fancy restaurants, where you can

00:14:26.649 --> 00:14:30.880
now witness how it's all done.

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:37.110
Once again, this open source ethic is a provocation
to the traditional notion of writing.

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:40.529
In so many ways, writing has not been open
at all.

00:14:40.529 --> 00:14:45.471
The writer has tended to style himself as
a solitary figure, working in isolation, cut

00:14:45.471 --> 00:14:50.819
off from everything, impermeable to the world
beyond and his readers.

00:14:50.819 --> 00:14:53.700
The writing industry, too, has never been
open.

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:57.670
It is hard to get an agent, harder still to
get a publisher, hard to get your book reviewed

00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:02.300
and placed on the faster-moving shelves of
the bookstores.

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:05.569
Exclusivity defines the writing world.

00:15:05.569 --> 00:15:11.399
It is something special to be a writer, something
not available to anyone who would try.

00:15:11.399 --> 00:15:16.689
Of course, in reality, the writer has always
been less isolated than she likes to imagine--embedded

00:15:16.689 --> 00:15:23.170
in a literary tradition, financially tied
to the money pots of her age, allied with

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:26.269
and opposed to other writers.

00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:33.379
But it is this vision of the writer as a priest
of words--remote, exclusive, authoritative--that

00:15:33.379 --> 00:15:38.149
is challenged by the ethic of openness that
marks our age.

00:15:38.149 --> 00:15:44.089
One of the most successful writers of today,
Paulo Coelho, recently spoke about his own

00:15:44.089 --> 00:15:46.730
embrace of digital values.

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:51.540
And specifically, of his addiction to Twitter,
where he seems to produce almost as many words

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:54.029
as he does through books.

00:15:54.029 --> 00:15:58.660
Here is what he said about the old way that
writers were conceived of in the society and

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:00.389
the emerging new way.

00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:01.579
Quote.

00:16:01.579 --> 00:16:06.100
They used to see writers as wise men and women
in an ivory tower, full of knowledge.

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:08.019
And you cannot touch them.

00:16:08.019 --> 00:16:10.519
The ivory tower does not exist anymore.

00:16:10.519 --> 00:16:13.300
If the reader doesn't like something, they'll
tell you.

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:16.689
He's not, or she's not, someone who's isolated.

00:16:16.689 --> 00:16:21.589
Once I found this possibility to use Twitter
and Facebook and my blog to connect to my

00:16:21.589 --> 00:16:23.410
readers, I'm going to use it.

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:27.189
To connect to them and to share thoughts that
I cannot use in the book.

00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:29.999
Today I have on Facebook, six million people.

00:16:29.999 --> 00:16:31.339
End quote.

00:16:31.339 --> 00:16:35.870
He also noted in that interview that he had
more Facebook followers than Madonna.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:37.010
[chuckling]

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:44.680
What he did not mention there, but later did,
was use a webcam and Twitter to allow anyone

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:50.769
with an internet connection to watch him at
his desk writing his next book, which I did

00:16:50.769 --> 00:16:54.079
and discovered to be a surprisingly boring
thing to watch.

00:16:54.079 --> 00:16:55.100
[laughter]

00:16:55.100 --> 00:17:00.490
My friend Baratunde Thurston, a comedian and
author of the new and bitingly hilarious book,

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:04.290
"How to be Black," did something even more
radical.

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:10.390
I suggested to him one day that he use a screen
sharing site called join dot me to reveal

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:16.200
to his fans what his word processor screen
looked like as he finished the last chapter

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.610
of his book.

00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:21.230
He's one of these guys who's up for anything,
so he did it.

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:26.910
And so, as he finished that last chapter,
people tuned in and watched his screen the

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:29.550
same way he was seeing his screen.

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:35.300
And it created amazing conversations and connections
between him and his readers--connections that

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:39.280
he never could've gotten by coming around
and doing a book talk like this, which is

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:43.150
still the traditional understanding of how
to do it.

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:47.780
And it demystified--this is the important
part about the world of openness--it demystified

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:53.270
this process of writing that is so magical
to people, but closed and inaccessible at

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:54.760
the same time.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:58.280
It showed that you sometimes delete things
and then rewrite them and then delete them

00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.280
again.

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:04.270
And it shows the contingency of something
that seems so polished and formal, but is

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:06.550
not.

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:11.290
And yet, I can see this terrifying many writers,
this screen sharing, including this one right

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:12.290
here.

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:17.270
I don't think many of us are yet ready to
do what Baratunde did.

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:22.190
Writers will perhaps resist this culture of
openness for a time.

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:24.300
But is Paulo Coelho right?

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:28.640
Must the writer accept a fundamental shift
in what is opened and what is kept closed?

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:35.080
Must she accept that she is no longer a priest
hovering above her readers, but now a pilgrim

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.780
walking among them?

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:46.140
So, I've suggested to you three ways, among
others, in which digital culture, the assumptions

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:54.710
of the digital world, pose challenges to the
writer as traditionally understood.

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:59.910
What I don't want to imply is that the world
you are building, here at Google, is inherently

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:02.530
threatening to the writing life.

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:09.010
What it threatens is the conventional, the
received, idea of what a writer is.

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:13.550
But the best writing exists to overturn the
received and the conventional.

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:21.400
So, we must be open to the visions and revisions
of writing that new realities inspire.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:27.420
For a young writer like me, early in his career,
there is much, seemingly, to be gained from

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:33.650
this new universe and its new equations of
influence and authority.

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:38.120
My friend Anne-Marie Slaughter, a wonderful
scholar at Princeton and former State Department

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:43.700
official under Barack Obama, speaks of every
profession's having to adapt to these new

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.860
equations of power and influence.

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:50.040
"The leader," she says, "must become a catalyst.

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:53.590
The public relations agent, a convener.

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:56.260
The diplomat, a connector.

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:59.430
The reporter, a mapper and crowd sourcer.

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:02.540
The editor, a curator."

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:08.420
In each of these shifts, an older exclusive
authority is diminished.

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:12.300
Influence in this new way lies in catalysis.

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:18.810
What elsewhere has been called power with
others rather than power over others.

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:24.930
And writers, too, must ask themselves, "What
does it mean now to have power with and not

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:28.430
power over the reader?"

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:34.200
If you look at this generation of writers,
not VS Naipaul's generation, but the generation

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:40.840
rising up now and even some older writers,
people are finding ways to be true to the

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:46.500
writing vocation and yet, be part of this
new reality.

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:51.810
Whether it's Paulo Coelho opening up his writing
process and yet knowing when to shut it off

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:57.780
and go within, whether it's Teju Cole, the
Nigerian novelist, who has taken to Twitter,

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:02.580
but not to talk about the Super Bowl, but
rather to remix and rewrite the Nigerian news

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:09.190
headlines in a brilliant and literary novelistic
way, or Salman Rushdie, getting into Twitter

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:15.420
wars and pally banter, even as he remains
wearing another hat among our most serious

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:19.190
defenders of writing with a capital W.

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:22.510
The question perhaps is this.

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:28.070
As a writer gives in to these new possibilities,
or to put it more positively, learns to profit

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:36.630
from and bask in them, what would be his or
her special role in the instantaneous, feedback

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:39.120
driven, open world?

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:44.870
Is there still a special role for those more
considered thoughts, for those ideas that

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:52.900
take time and must be unwitnessed to mature,
for those things that cannot be crowd sourced?

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:55.990
That special role is something I believe in.

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:59.430
It's something I would urge you to believe
in, too.

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:04.450
And it consists, I think, in something that
is just about the opposite of the algorithms

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:07.660
for which Google is famous.

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:13.870
What remains vital in the writing vocation,
when it is practiced most ably, is the critical

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:21.760
consciousness, the wry voice, the ironic observation
that cuts against the grain of contemporary

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.690
understanding.

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:26.190
Algorithms make us more similar.

00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:29.740
They believe in the possibility of right answers.

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:33.020
The critical consciousness resists easy answers.

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:36.470
Indeed, always seeks to complicate things.

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:39.200
It seeks out lovely incongruities.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:45.040
It insists on what it sees when the crowd,
however numerous, is wrong.

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:48.770
It seeks not to answer, but to explain.

00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:50.700
Not to search, but to give meaning.

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:56.920
It seeks to turn human beings into that magical
invention called characters.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:02.470
People even fuller in words than they seem
in real life, brimming with contradiction

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:05.070
and complexity.

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:11.330
At its best, writing stands with legs in our
own time and eyes outside of it.

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:18.040
It questions the basic assumptions of an age
that are as normal to us as waves are to the

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:19.550
fish.

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:24.920
To take one example, the faith so common to
this time, that regressions of data are the

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:28.590
pre-eminent expression of truth.

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:35.210
In a season when big data rules, writing stands
for the usefulness of intuition, for the proposition

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:40.260
that things needn't always be scatter plottable
to be true.

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:46.100
The best writing is often the truth that people
don't want to hear, not always the aggregate

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:49.770
of each of their private understandings of
the truth.

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:56.400
Above all, perhaps, and in closing, writing
is how we give one person the experience of

00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:01.860
being another, of seeing the world as another
does.

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:08.150
When it does what it ought to do, and what
I hope it continues to do, writing is a blissful,

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:13.410
fleeting reprieve from the encumbrance of
knowing only ourselves.

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:16.520
Thank you very much.

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:18.010
[applause]

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:25.350
I'm happy to answer any questions about this
and I know I did not talk about the book on

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:26.350
your chairs.

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:29.630
I'm happy to talk about India and if you would
like, to do a short reading from the book

00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:30.630
as well.

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:32.600
But go ahead.

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:40.520
&gt;&gt;MALE #1: So, I guess one can think about
maybe the demise of certain great writer or

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:45.630
this priest of writing that you think about,
on the other hand, there's this destabilizing

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:46.630
force by breaking all these barriers, right?

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:47.630
And anybody now can potentially be a writer
and maybe there's more spontaneity.

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:50.450
So, I'm thinking the Arab Spring reports [ inaudible
]. Nobody really planned or considered or

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:51.450
orchestrated anything.

00:24:51.450 --> 00:25:10.430
So, I was wondering if you had any thoughts
about the more positive side of more free,

00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:13.250
open, and less controlled speech.

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:14.250
&gt;&gt;Anand Giridharadas: Absolutely.

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:20.160
And I think in a way there's a difference
between words and writing, but one of the

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:25.700
things that differentiates the Arab Spring
from things that happened even ten years ago

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:31.740
that were similar is that it was 98 percent
of the words that were written about it were

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:36.800
by the people there on their phones.

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:41.000
New York Times correspondents and Washington
Post correspondents account for a very small

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.450
fraction of all the words generated by that
crisis.

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:45.850
Now, a lot of it was crap.

00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:50.560
And a lot of it was wrong, but that doesn't
matter.

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:55.401
You have, as you say, this extraordinary opportunity
to turn everybody into a writer, to write

00:25:55.401 --> 00:25:57.360
about their little piece.

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:04.050
What's most useful from those tweets and other
forms of expression is often not their literary

00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:07.330
quality, it's just their informational value.

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:10.480
A reporter can't be everywhere.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:13.820
And so, the opportunity to say, "This happened
here and this happened here and to look at

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:16.390
trends and all this stuff," is very useful.

00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:25.220
I think if you were to reflect, however, on
how you came to understand the Arab Spring,

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:28.050
how you came to make a different kind of judgment
about it--.

00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:31.570
For example, should America intervene or not?

00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:36.840
Would America intervening and standing up
for the people help or hurt?

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:42.660
Those more complicated strategic judgments,
which are very important judgments, I'm not

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:47.730
sure if the tweets alone would've helped you
make that kind of judgment.

00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:54.390
I think there is still a huge place for context,
history, the weaving of those tweets into,

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:59.560
"Yeah, but every time people talk like that
in the last hundred years, this has happened

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:00.560
actually."

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:06.850
There's all these ways in which, to go back
to what Naipaul was saying, are easy thoughts

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:08.750
are not always the right thoughts.

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:12.520
So, there's a huge fluorescence in the world
today of easy thoughts.

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:16.700
So, part of what you're saying when many more
people can write and these barriers breaking,

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:18.750
it's a proliferation of easy thoughts.

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:24.540
I think the question that I'm raising is what
does that do for hard thoughts?

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:31.150
It doesn't necessarily destroy hard thoughts,
but it creates a culture in which the premium

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:36.860
on hard thoughts may be reduced.

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:43.980
And I think the ability to make some of the
choices like, do we intervene or not, or does

00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:48.890
Google thinking about very complex ethical
choices around privacy, these are deep questions

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:56.030
that require a deeper level of scrutiny that
I think writing has traditionally stood up

00:27:56.030 --> 00:28:06.860
for and that I hope it continues to stand
up for.

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:18.930
&gt;&gt;MALE #2: You've had a lot of international
experience and I've read quite a lot about

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:19.930
it.

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:22.700
I'm curious as to whether you see these three
trends of instantaneousness, openness, and

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:26.020
feedback if you find that their impact is
more or less equal across the world.

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:31.120
And if you could, talk about the democratization
and global nature of these kinds of trends.

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.910
Do you find that there are communities that
are left behind?

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:34.980
And connected to that, something else you've
written a lot about--this is two questions--is

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:40.230
the role of the United States and the future
of the way we see ourselves in our role internationally,

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:43.250
do you see that changing because of this?

00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:49.320
&gt;&gt;Anand Giridharadas: On the first point,
it's totally not evenly distributed.

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:54.380
So, that's an obvious point which has to do
with the way the internet works and the way

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:58.380
censorship works.

00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:02.890
It's still extremely possible, despite the
rhetoric of internet openness, like countries

00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:05.360
routinely opt out of entire platforms.

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:09.120
And those companies often support that decision.

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:13.760
So, the internet is not as universal as we
often think it is.

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:19.310
But I would say that even in places where
there's a high degree of what sociologists

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:23.570
call power distance, which is the sense people
have, the people in power have, how far they

00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:24.650
are from them.

00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:27.480
Not physically, but psychologically.

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:36.290
Even in places with high power distance, like
India, the things that this technology does--all

00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:45.950
these elements--the ability to tweet at certain
ministers who actually tweet back is something

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:49.810
unimaginable for a middle-class Indian.

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:54.370
It's something that creates an opportunity
that he has not had, or she has not had, in

00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:55.690
any way at all.

00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:58.270
There's absolutely nothing like it.

00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:01.930
You take something like being a foreign correspondent
in India, which is a relatively privileged

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:07.690
role, and how hard it is to get through the
maze of phones to get at a minister to interview

00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:12.060
them, right, which is why everybody uses cell
phone numbers because you can't get through

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:13.810
the official land line channel.

00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:16.200
There are assistants and deputy assistants.

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:19.120
And then suddenly, some guy in a village can
tweet at Shashi Tharoor.

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:22.030
And Shashi Tharoor tweets back.

00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:28.970
It is such an upheaval to that person in the
village's traditional understanding of what

00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:33.240
power is and how it works and yet, that person
goes home to there being on and off water,

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:36.520
no electricity in the village, and totally
corrupt local officials.

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:42.210
So, I think we often tend to imagine that
if this stuff arrives, it wipes out everything.

00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:43.210
It doesn't.

00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:50.300
But it's still extremely powerful in the intervention
it makes in traditional equations of power.

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:56.790
To your second point about America's role,
I think it's one of the reasons

00:30:56.790 --> 00:31:07.730
I came back from India and still write about
the world, but from a base here for a newspaper

00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:16.040
here because I actually think this commitment
to writing and bearing witness to something

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:23.680
special as a craft is more respected here
still and has greater institutions that defend

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:27.220
it than anywhere else in the world.

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:35.020
And even though these internet and technological
trends are, in large part, originating here,

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:43.060
it is also that older idea of writing is something
worthy of protection that flourishes here.

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:44.340
I don't know that I could do--.

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:53.360
I certainly don't think I could today do what
I do having grown up in 90 percent of the

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:54.480
countries in the world.

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:59.770
Not because of freedom or censorship, just
because of the kind of atmosphere and education

00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:06.470
it takes to be able to see things critically
and to see outside things and to into people's

00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:07.470
lives.

00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:15.310
There are very few countries that allow that
kind of consciousness to form.

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:41.790
&gt;&gt;MALE #3: There are two aspects to what you
presented to what we're discussing now that

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:46.760
are very compelling.

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:59.630
The first aspect is the construct of content
creation.

00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:05.930
And the second is content distribution.

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:09.790
The tool sets and facilities that we have
these days are the computers that we have.

00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:10.900
Plus, content creation can be universally
shared by everyone.

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:12.080
Everybody can use the same tools to create
the content.

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:16.960
Just as in the music industry and in desktop
publishing revolution, the tools just became

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:18.620
better and better.

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:26.610
Now, in terms of distribution, the internet
has turned out to be a great equalizer there

00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:27.740
in general.

00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:31.190
So, what I mean is that it used to be that
music, artists were at the mercy of the studios

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:32.190
to have any chance of getting their music
heard globally.

00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:33.190
&gt;&gt;Anand Giridharadas: Right.

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:34.190
&gt;&gt;MALE #3: That is no longer the case.

00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:35.190
&gt;&gt;Anand Giridharadas: Right.

00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:36.190
&gt;&gt;MALE #3: And I would argue that writers
may be moving into a convergence there, whether

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:37.190
or not the quality of their work is as good
as those that did not have those advantages

00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:38.190
at an earlier stage in time.

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:39.190
&gt;&gt;Anand Giridharadas: Absolutely.

00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:40.190
And I think that's the trade-off.

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:41.190
So, given that the problem of writing--.

00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:44.650
It's hard to imagine something more ripe for
disruption, to put it one way, right?

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:49.390
A process where--I mean, just think about
it-- a process where you have to know people

00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:50.390
who have an agent.

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:52.110
And then the agent has to know people to get
a publisher.

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:54.810
And it's based on random forces, etcetera.

00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:58.120
That's based on all the premise of printing.

00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:03.210
So, all the rituals, even publishing an eBook
today, you need to go through all the rituals

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:04.810
designed for the print world.

00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:13.280
But when it's not scarce, when it's effortless,
basically costless, to distribute, it's almost

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:16.060
silly for any publishing company to restrict
who they publish.

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:18.159
They just publish everybody.

00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:21.520
But certain kinds of work--.

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:26.639
I think what you would do, very simply if
you were to switch to that world, would be

00:34:26.639 --> 00:34:31.210
to drastically improve your discovery of voices.

00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:32.540
Right?

00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:35.100
So, it's the money ball thing.

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:40.000
You'd find all these writers who for some
arbitrary reason of our judgment and our structures

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.490
in the world don't get published, and you
publish them.

00:34:42.490 --> 00:34:44.310
&gt;&gt;MALE #3: [inaudible]

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:46.129
&gt;&gt;Anand Giridharadas: Right.

00:34:46.129 --> 00:34:51.610
But I think what you also would do, I think
you'd kill a lot of the kinds of writing that

00:34:51.610 --> 00:34:58.990
have also been important to the world because
you would, in a way, there's certain kinds

00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:06.600
of writing that require the judgment of a
publisher to approve it, to stick with you

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:11.120
for three years--to publish it, to edit it,
to pull it out of you in a time when the market

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:13.290
would not reward you for those three years.

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:17.810
And if you had to make it on your own in the
market world, you wouldn't last three years

00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:22.010
and then you'd quit and you'd go work at Google
or do something more sensible.

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:23.130
&gt;&gt;MALE #3: [inaudible]

00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:24.410
&gt;&gt;Anand Giridharadas: You might be.

00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:27.240
So, I think we'll increase, but those things
go together.

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:30.900
I think we'll find more of JK Rowling's right?

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:36.060
But there are a lot of people who would not
get that investment because itâs basically

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:38.780
marketizing the writing world.

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:42.110
That's basically what we're talking about--making
it more open market, which means you discover

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:51.200
more talent, but what you don't get is the
kind of publisher at Knopf who sees a 26-year

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:55.690
old writer, sees what they can be five years
early, develops them in a way that's totally

00:35:55.690 --> 00:36:01.100
not ever gonna pay itself back, pushes them
and creates a literary great.

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:03.880
And that is a big part of the industry of
publishing.

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.270
So, that would be my concern.

00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:11.530
But I think overall, in a writing world that
is dominated by so few voices from so few

00:36:11.530 --> 00:36:17.920
places, this is in the main an extraordinary
chance to hear other voices.

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:23.260
&gt;&gt;MALE #4: This is a two-part question and
I don't have time to praise your talk with

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:24.260
your book.

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:30.740
So you talked about how a villager in India
can now tweet with a minister and get a reply.

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:36.170
But then, that also was partly responsible
for the minister losing his job because the

00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:37.980
country wasn't quite ready for that.

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:38.980
&gt;&gt;Anand Giridharadas: Absolutely.

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:44.690
&gt;&gt;MALE #4: So, what do you think it will take
for countries like that to get ready and embrace

00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:52.670
the fact that everyone can be open and encourage
ministers to be open and aren't, be scared

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:53.870
of that?

00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:58.711
And taking from that, what do you feel the
key difference is between say, India, and

00:36:58.711 --> 00:37:01.570
other countries and the US you talked about
in your book?

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:05.670
&gt;&gt;Anand Giridharadas: I mean, I think in your
first point it will not be accepted for an

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:09.780
extraordinarily long time because it rationally
should not by those other people.

00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:14.180
Shashi Tharoor is a different kind of minister
who's suggesting a different kind of Indian

00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:15.620
power equation.

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:20.830
And the kind of Indian power equation he believes
in, which is in some ways more familiar here,

00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:26.500
where he spent the last 20 years of his life,
is deeply threatening if you are a traditional

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:31.470
Indian minister with guys in white kurtas
waking up outside your house every morning

00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:37.380
calling you "sir, sir" and lines of sycophants
coming to tell you how wonderful you are every

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:42.690
morning, what he suggests is a totally different
idea of power.

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:45.500
Those people will absolutely reject this idea
of power.

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:50.590
When you talk about barriers being broken,
it is them, those people, who are being broken

00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:54.710
because that villager, when he realizes that
that minister is actually an ordinary guy

00:37:54.710 --> 00:38:00.760
who can respond to me, is gonna start asking
why other people don't.

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:12.060
And part of this shift--and Shashi Tharoor,
interestingly, is a writer as well as a politician--this

00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:13.690
is happening to writing, too.

00:38:13.690 --> 00:38:14.690
And it's very--.

00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:17.520
It's a bit abstract, but it's also very practical.

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:22.680
The practical question is, while you're writing
a novel, should you tweet and share little

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.530
bits and ask, "What do you think about that
sentence?"

00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:25.530
Or should you not?

00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:26.640
It's a very practical question.

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:29.310
How do you spend your day?

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:35.190
Should you, every time you have an interesting
idea, get it out there and road test it?

00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:39.640
Or should you hold them, let them stew, let
them go through the Darwinian process within

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:42.320
you, let the bad ones die and the good ones
endure?

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:45.480
And then, share when it's the right time.

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:50.680
These are very different choices and they
have to do, at the core level, with how you

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:52.780
think about power and influence.

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:56.580
And I think writers don't tend to think of
themselves in terms of power and influence,

00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:57.580
right?

00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:02.650
But I forget the exact number, but I think
they found recently--I think it may have been

00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:07.780
Google that found this--that there have been--I
forget the exact number--but they found the

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:09.860
number of books that have ever been written.

00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:13.550
And it worked out to about one book per thousand
humans who've ever lived.

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:15.510
It sounds about right.

00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:20.850
So, one in a thousand people who have ever
lived have produced a book on average.

00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:26.460
Now, it's that kind of specialness around
writing that I think is under threat, but

00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:28.720
it's probably a very good thing that it's
under threat.

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:33.860
I think everything else in the world that's
being disrupted, these things were less special

00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:38.120
than they seemed and deserve to be opened
up.

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:43.640
But you don't wanna lose the core of what
also made them work.

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:54.650
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #1: So, one other thing they've really
driven home here at Google about like, Google+

00:39:54.650 --> 00:40:01.800
versus other social networks, is one, they
really tried to make Google+ or Facetime more

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:02.800
educated and involved conversations.

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:03.800
Not like on Twitter, supposedly Facebook encourages
something else.

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:04.800
And I'm just wondering your opinion on what
it would take to--.

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:08.020
'Cause I mean, right now we have more knowledge
available at our fingertips than any other

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:09.369
time, so we should be having these conversations.

00:40:09.369 --> 00:40:11.900
But there's a lot of other distractions going
on that take us on other passages.

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:21.481
I'm wondering what you think about that and
if there is a forum or the right place that

00:40:21.481 --> 00:40:22.960
will develop those conversations.

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:25.530
&gt;&gt;Anand Giridharadas: And I think that's a
great point.

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:34.050
And it goes back to the point raised earlier,
which is that I think one of the great disappointments

00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:42.750
of the democratization of information is how
poorly a lot of us have used it.

00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:49.990
I think I would be slightly more excited by
all this barrier breaking if its primary effect,

00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:53.420
or at least one of its primary effects, was
liberating all these new voices.

00:40:53.420 --> 00:41:00.480
I think if you go to Reddit, the primary effect
so far has been to unleash a lot of human

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:03.060
ugliness.

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:07.420
That's been much more of an important effect
in a way of the last ten years.

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:11.200
And then there's the Arab Spring and these
things that happened that are different.

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:19.450
But 95 percent of these unleashing of new
voices is people being at best, kind of fine,

00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:21.340
and at worst, mean, racist.

00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:27.810
I mean, racism now has received a second wind
from the opening up of these communications

00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:30.950
that you don't realize it really hadn't had
in a long time.

00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:33.130
Where were those sentiments going 15 years
ago?

00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:35.510
Maybe to your family, and that's it.

00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:37.340
These are things that you couldn't say at
work.

00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:43.981
People now openly utter racist things in these
social forums that actually, they have no

00:41:43.981 --> 00:41:48.090
other place to utter in polite, American society
anymore.

00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:50.920
So, I don't know what the answer is.

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:56.340
And again, this is part of, we don't live
in the world where Walter Cronkite brought

00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:59.940
all of us the news of President Kennedy's
death at the same time and 40 million of us

00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:02.050
watched that, or whatever it was.

00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:06.520
And the next day, we could go in and say,
"Where were you when Walter Cronkite told

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:07.520
you that--?"

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:13.990
It's not a synchronous mass culture world
in that way.

00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:21.570
And that's probably for the good, but I think
one very serious question is, why is our ugliness

00:42:21.570 --> 00:42:28.350
such a prominent feature of what we feel like
expressing when all these new voices are allowed?

00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:39.100
And I think for you guys, the interesting
technological question is, are there algorithms

00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:43.810
and rules of engagement that actually influence
our behavior?

00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:45.480
Is it that we've designed the internet wrong?

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:46.480
Is it a design problem?

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:47.930
Are we just terrible people?

00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:49.270
Or, is it design choices?

00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:56.280
So, one very famous design choice is anonymity,
which was a choice someone made.

00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:59.490
The internet could have been not anonymous.

00:42:59.490 --> 00:43:01.260
And it's anonymous.

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:07.869
The choice to make it anonymous has allowed
an ugliness to flourish.

00:43:07.869 --> 00:43:12.800
That, for example, on Facebook, which now
pushes more and more for actual identity and

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:19.330
you can't even use a given name if it's not
your passport name in theory, it makes it

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:20.890
a little bit harder.

00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:27.250
So, I think that whole debate, which you guys
know about, persistent identity, is one solution

00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:31.580
even if you say in the Arab Spring situation,
it doesn't have to be your real identity.

00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:36.330
But you have to maintain a single persistent
identity throughout these conversations.

00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:39.920
But I think it's a very interesting technical
question to think about, besides persistent

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:45.900
identity or true identity, what are ways of
hacking these conversations to allow them

00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:52.140
to be free and open, but to bring out some
of what's good in us, rather than most of

00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:53.790
what's bad?

00:43:53.790 --> 00:44:03.650
&gt;&gt;MALE #5: So, earlier when you were speaking,
you were talking about several factors that

00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:14.420
were driving the art of writing, or the world
of writing, towards more spontaneous and perhaps

00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:22.220
somewhat less deep thinking and expression
and that kind of thing.

00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:26.250
How likely is it do you think that there's
some sort of critical style writing will actually

00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:32.090
survive, given that there are these macroeconomic
forces against it?

00:44:32.090 --> 00:44:41.869
&gt;&gt;Anand Giridharadas: I mean, I think I'm
never pessimistic about vocations as much

00:44:41.869 --> 00:44:42.869
as I am about industries.

00:44:42.869 --> 00:44:44.983
There's a difference between the vocation
and industry.

00:44:44.983 --> 00:44:48.130
The industry could well die.

00:44:48.130 --> 00:44:52.080
But that's like saying the CD industry is
dead, but music is not dead.

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:55.720
I mean, is it a worse time for music than
it was ten years ago?

00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:56.960
Absolutely not.

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.210
It's better.

00:44:58.210 --> 00:45:01.220
It's a worse time for people who make CDs,
though.

00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:08.619
It may be a worse time for musicians, but
it's not a worse time for music.

00:45:08.619 --> 00:45:12.730
And I think the same thing will happen for
writing to an extent, that it will be a worse

00:45:12.730 --> 00:45:16.100
time possibly for writers.

00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:22.410
Certainly a worse time for people who publish
writing--the companies that publish it.

00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:24.880
And there will be all kinds of new opportunities.

00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:34.530
So, today, a young friend of mine who's in
graduate school here, we'd been talking about

00:45:34.530 --> 00:45:36.090
her career and she wants to be a journalist.

00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:38.030
And what I tell her is, "You should learn
to do everything.

00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:41.040
So, you should write," which she does very
well.

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:46.660
"You should learn to write in European languages
and in English," which she's partly doing.

00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:49.080
"You should learn to shoot video."

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:51.510
Because the premium is less on good video.

00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:53.610
It's on video that a company's--.

00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:56.970
The same person that was doing the writing
was able to do video, was able to do an audio

00:45:56.970 --> 00:45:59.610
interview, was able to live blog.

00:45:59.610 --> 00:46:03.990
I spoke to an editor at a very large American
magazine yesterday, who said that magazine

00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:06.950
is moving in the direction of--.

00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:09.500
This magazine has very long cycles of publication.

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:13.170
It may be a year between the time they assign
a story and the story in print.

00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:19.620
So he said throughout that year, that person
can actually live blog the production of the

00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:23.380
story, the work that goes into it, they can
send photos.

00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:29.070
You can tease the story for a year and then
the magazine piece becomes this final hoorah

00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:30.620
after a year.

00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:35.050
So, there's definitely ways in which this
stuff will get remixed and remade to be even

00:46:35.050 --> 00:46:36.980
better than it was before.

00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:42.380
But I think the real question behind your
question is in a way after all this sorts

00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:46.750
itself out and the companies go and change
and some new forms are created, some new forms

00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:51.380
die, where will the vocation be?

00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:58.040
What will the person who wants to be a writer,
who wants to, as I said earlier, stand against

00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:02.240
the grain of the time, what will be their
place?

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:06.369
Will they have to work other jobs, which is
not necessarily a bad thing?

00:47:06.369 --> 00:47:08.730
Sometimes, it gives you an exposure to real
life.

00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:14.950
So, you could have changes like writers need,
for the sake of employment, to be employed

00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:16.830
and write on the side.

00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:19.730
Which is what a lot of 19th Century writers
did.

00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:24.940
You could have the idea that all publishing
becomes self-publishing, which means we have

00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:28.700
a much more market-driven publishing industry,
much less curation.

00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:29.700
That would be good.

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:30.700
That would be bad.

00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:34.640
But I think the question is, where will the
voices that in a way we don't wanna hear,

00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:37.710
but need to hear, where will they go?

00:47:37.710 --> 00:47:42.040
There's certain things that will not trend
on Amazon, but need to.

00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:45.770
Those are the things that I think are worth
worrying about the most.

00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:46.930
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: All right.

00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:48.960
So, we have a gift for you.

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:52.150
And please join me in thanking Anand for speaking
with us.

00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:53.600
&gt;&gt;Anand Giridharadas: Thank you all.

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:53.890
