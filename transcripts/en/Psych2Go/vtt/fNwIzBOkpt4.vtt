00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.340
Dear late bloomers,

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.525
Are you worried that you won't reach your goals because you haven't landed your first adult job yet?

00:00:07.525 --> 00:00:12.520
Or maybe you feel reluctant to put yourself out there because you haven't dated anyone before.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.175
I'm a late bloomer myself. And I can tell you that life has a mysterious way of working on us -

00:00:18.175 --> 00:00:19.845
- when we least expect it to.

00:00:20.265 --> 00:00:22.325
Before continuing with this video,

00:00:22.325 --> 00:00:25.535
I want you to shut off your phone, and close out of your Facebook,

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.735
Instagram, and any other social media page.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.455
For the next few minutes, let's forget about the status updates on your friend who just Tweeted -

00:00:33.455 --> 00:00:34.865
- about the promotion they got.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.840
Forget about the pictures of the guy you've always had a crush on, making silly faces with his new girlfriend.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.220
Forget about what you want to be, just in this moment.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.080
Here is something I want to let you know:

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.840
In life, there's no expiration date until the day we die.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.040
The whole idea of living in a linear fashion is not only absurd, but suffocating -

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.220
- and it prevents you from being honest with yourself.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.720
When social norms expect us to finish highschool, go off to college, get a degree,

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.240
get a job, get married, have a kid,

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.520
and retire when we're 65 -

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.020
those don't actually determine our success or happiness.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.880
I have met people who thought they met The One and planned their entire future out together.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.560
They couldn't wait to get married, and start a family -

00:01:21.705 --> 00:01:26.555
- but somewhere down the road, they just stopped loving each other. And guess what?

00:01:26.555 --> 00:01:28.715
Life still moves us forward.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.860
You can be the most prepared person, have your whole life mapped out in front of your eyes,

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.080
And somehow, someday, something will pull a rug under your feet.

00:01:38.085 --> 00:01:40.535
And that might sound like the saddest thing ever -

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.500
- but the truth is: we don't start fully living until something shakes us up inside -

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.300
and we drop everything we thought we knew -

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.020
to go after what we finally understand.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:56.715
My favorite author, Haruki Murakami, didn't pursue his writing career until he was 29.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.840
He rebelled against the social norms, and married his wife before he even finished college.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.820
They used to own a jazz bar together.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.120
He did things out of order, mainly because he did what felt right and natural for him -

00:02:09.135 --> 00:02:11.315
He simply embraced the present.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.400
I didn't get my first kiss until I was 21 and didn't start dating until I was 23 -

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.020
and when I admitted those things, guess what?

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.460
People didn't see me as anything less.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.800
My boyfriend went through the same motions before we met, and I certainly don't see him any differently.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.800
He once said to me:

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.420
"There are people who have lived and seen more in their years than others."

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.000
He was referring to the wisdom we collect when we go through the dark times.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.920
So what if you're in your twenties, and haven't moved out of your parents' house yet ?

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.655
So what if you just started school, and so what if you're a virgin?

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.660
None of that matters nearly as much as your ability to keep an open mind and heart.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.935
I bet somewhere down the road, the people who graduated as [?] or the people who landed a job -

00:02:58.935 --> 00:03:03.885
- right after college, will experience something that challenges them to fall off the linear path.

00:03:04.815 --> 00:03:10.045
Let's not forget that youth provides us the opportunity to make mistakes, explore your options -

00:03:10.045 --> 00:03:13.340
- and go through the motions of finding who you are.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.500
It's not about who gets to the finish line first.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.055
We spend our whole lives competing, running on the hamster wheel, and for what?

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.340
When it only spins us in a circular, designed motion.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.240
We could be humanizing one another instead.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.280
You're not behind, and you're not actually late.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.000
So, do what makes sense to you, on *your* time.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.000
What will you start embracing as a "Late Bloomer" ?
