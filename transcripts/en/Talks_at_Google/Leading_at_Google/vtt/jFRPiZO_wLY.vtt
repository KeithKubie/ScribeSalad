[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.944 --> 00:00:09.920
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:11.172 --> 00:00:13.630
MARCUS GRIMALDO: This year's
theme is really special to us,

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.850
I think, given what's
going on in the world

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.830
and how we want to be able to
go about it in a productive way

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.340
that is impactful,
that is sensible,

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.710
and that is endearing
in the sense

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.890
that you can take away
something that is meaningful.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.950
This year's theme for
HOLA on the campus--

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.280
that's our Hispanic chapter,
by the way, and it is global--

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.140
is [SPANISH]--

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.060
hear me.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.200
Right, what does that mean?

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.530
How does each one
conceptualize that?

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.234
And so when we look at
that theme and the artwork

00:00:49.234 --> 00:00:50.650
that you all have
chosen to bring,

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.790
I think there's
a lot of synergy.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.248
I think there's a
lot of alignment.

00:00:53.248 --> 00:00:56.500
I think that there's
a lot behind that what

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.090
we see in the Boardwalk Cafe.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.740
If you all know
that artists here,

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.770
their artwork is displayed
in the Boardwalk Cafe

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.757
and they've done a great job.

00:01:04.757 --> 00:01:07.090
And so today, we're really
going to use this opportunity

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.730
to see what is behind the art.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.110
Who is behind the artists--

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.580
what that narrative is?

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.480
And I'm a big believer
in narratives.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.090
I think everyone has a story,
or at least they should.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.940
And if you don't have
one, you can kind of

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.560
make one up like,
oh, you know, I came

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.610
from the Bronx or something.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.235
Everybody loves the
Bronx story, right?

00:01:23.235 --> 00:01:25.770
I'm totally joking.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.810
No, but I have been
researching these three artists

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.330
this past week and am
super excited for this talk

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.550
to get to know them
on an intimate level

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.310
and evoke a sense of who they
are and what [SPANISH] means.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.280
So we're going to
talk about all of this

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.740
as we encounter this discussion.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:51.220
So we'll start with our first
artist here, Margaret Garcia,

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.410
born in East Los Angeles.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.840
You've seen her work around the
1984 Olympics possibly, LACMA,

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.275
the Laguna Art Museum,
and even Cheech Marin.

00:02:02.275 --> 00:02:03.457
All right, this is awesome.

00:02:03.457 --> 00:02:05.040
I spent some time
on the website and I

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.790
was like, wow, who doesn't
know Cheech and Chong?

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.373
And if you don't, I'd say make
that a Netflix and chill night.

00:02:09.373 --> 00:02:11.550
It's super funny.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.920
And she has a story that
is just absolutely amazing.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.760
We want to learn about it.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.470
And so in essence, she
is a working, thriving,

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.780
and recognized artist.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.690
Ladies and gentlemen, let's
give her a hand and welcome her.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.015
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.015
So Margaret, before we get into
the painting that you see here

00:02:34.015 --> 00:02:36.280
or your artistic expression
that's there-- and I mean,

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.390
god, it's Selena, right?

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.700
She's been gone
for over 20 years.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.530
She's timeless
almost, in a sense.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.160
And she's a legend
and legends never die.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.420
Talk to us about who you are.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.484
You're from Los Angeles.

00:02:48.484 --> 00:02:49.900
We've had a chance,
an opportunity

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.630
to talk a little bit
about who you are.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.860
I was excited about your story.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.610
You know, how did you come
into this working, thriving,

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.670
and recognized artists?

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.090
MARGARET GARCIA: Well,
I was born in East LA

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.880
to an undocumented person--

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.640
my mother-- but my
father was born here.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.980
My grandmother was born
in Texas and her mother--

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.560
my great-grandmother-- and
my great-great-grandmother

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.750
came to El Paso.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.580
They were Tarahumara
from Chihuahua.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.520
And they were here
a long time ago.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:37.940
My great-grandmother lived
in the Santa Clara Village

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.880
down on Virgil Street
near the metro station.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.830
But my father was born here.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.090
His mother was born here.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.890
He was repatriated to Mexico.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.450
His father went with
him-- my grandfather.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.580
And I found the paperwork
of my grandfather, who

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:04.000
was Apache, living on a
reservation in Arizona

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.170
and working there.

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.850
And his registration for
the draft for World War I--

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.020
I find this, right?

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.950
MARCUS GRIMALDO: Wow.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.320
MARGARET GARCIA: And yet,
he's repatriated along

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.540
with my father and
his two brothers.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:25.720
And his eldest brother drowns on
the trip back through Tijuana.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.070
He absconded with the children
and then was repatriated,

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:37.960
and so he was
raised near ObregÃ³n,

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.860
Sonora in a little
[INAUDIBLE] village.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.690
You know, he was Apache,
but you know the thing

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.270
that I think a lot
of Americans do not

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.050
understand about the
Mexican experience--

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.090
the Chicano
experience-- because I'm

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.800
sort of that subset of group.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.690
I'm Chicana, you know.

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:05.350
--is that he's Apache, and
the Yaqui and the Apache

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.270
are kind of like family.

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.450
They're like different
clans of the same people.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.770
And one of the
reasons why we hold on

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:20.710
so dearly to the terminology
of that-- and other Latinos

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.040
don't understand it
because they say, well,

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.240
but you're not including us.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.950
It isn't that we want
to exclude people.

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:33.520
I think we are very
inclusive, but the terminology

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.920
that links us to this land
continually and perpetually

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.120
makes us the immigrant,
whether we are or we are not.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.440
And my father was born here.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.040
His mother was born here.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.110
They're from indigenous people
who are from this continent.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.510
We are not really
the immigrant, but we

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.180
are the perpetual immigrant.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.270
And that's something that
people do not understand.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.970
And it's one of the reasons
why people like me--

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.730
born in the '50s--

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.850
people call me Chicanosaurus or
whatever they want to call me.

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:09.559
I'm good with that, you know.

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:11.683
MARCUS GRIMALDO: It's the
first I've heard of that,

00:06:11.683 --> 00:06:12.490
but I love it.

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.365
MARGARET GARCIA: Yeah,
you know, stuck in it,

00:06:14.365 --> 00:06:19.360
but that's fine for me
because I understand

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.640
how important that
piece of heritage

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.060
is to us because
Mexicanos-- all of them--

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.950
they're not all immigrants.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:32.020
And California-- and I
did the metro station

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.550
at the Campo de Cahuenga where
the capitulation of Cahuenga

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:41.800
was signed making California a
territory of the United States.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.360
This was Mexico, people.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.250
So that's really difficult
for people to understand,

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.830
but it's a very,
very deep heritage.

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.370
And yes, we have a
lot of connections

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.250
with the rest of the
Latinos of Central

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.770
and South America
and everything else,

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:02.312
but I can't give that up yet.

00:07:02.312 --> 00:07:03.770
MARCUS GRIMALDO:
No, you know what?

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:06.140
And I completely
understand that.

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.040
And I get that totally
because my grandfather

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:13.670
on the Mexican side had a
ranch in San Antonio, Texas.

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:17.100
And so in that sense, before it
was that, it was always Mexico.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.374
So the family had it
for centuries, right?

00:07:19.374 --> 00:07:21.040
So it's like we didn't
cross the border,

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.480
the borders crossed
us type of thing.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.646
MARGARET GARCIA: Absolutely.

00:07:23.646 --> 00:07:26.415
MARCUS GRIMALDO: And he married
my grandmother Guadalupe who--

00:07:26.415 --> 00:07:28.040
you want to tell us
a little bit about?

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.456
You touched upon
her a little bit.

00:07:29.456 --> 00:07:31.070
But when I was
reading your story,

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:32.930
that hit home for me because--

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.840
God rest her soul-- but yeah,
who is Guadalupe to you?

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.510
MARGARET GARCIA: My
grandmother adopted

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:41.660
a little girl named Guadalupe.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.750
And she died of
tuberculosis of the bone

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:49.610
in the communicable diseases
ward at the general hospital.

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.280
And then she found
my father again

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.470
and he came back to
live with her after he

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:56.280
was being raised in Sonora.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.190
And my mother came--

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:01.220
illegally, she crossed.

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.610
And my grandmother
was a bit of a coyote,

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:07.590
and so what she did
was she gave my mother

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:09.830
those papers that showed--

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.310
so she was using
Guadalupe's papers.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:16.380
So when I was born, the name
on the birth certificate

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:22.250
said Guadalupe, so I have a
two-page birth certificate

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:23.120
that corrected that.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.290
We went and we corrected
all that stuff.

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:27.420
And my mother became
an American citizen.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.510
MARCUS GRIMALDO:
Wow, that's amazing.

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:31.100
And just listening
to your story,

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.570
you said a couple of things--

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:33.975
repatriated.

00:08:33.975 --> 00:08:34.850
MARGARET GARCIA: Yes.

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:36.766
MARCUS GRIMALDO: I think
that almost hits home

00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:40.260
because it's kind of what
almost pretty much has went on

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:41.419
just recently, right?

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:43.970
So can we get a little bit
deeper on like repatriated?

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:45.740
What does that mean
and then how do you

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.550
parallel that to like
what happened today?

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:52.154
I mean, what do you
think of that as far as--

00:08:52.154 --> 00:08:53.570
I mean, that's a
long time, but it

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:55.986
sounds like it kind of happened
today with what, you know,

00:08:55.986 --> 00:08:58.400
the current state of just
where we were at, right?

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:02.240
MARGARET GARCIA:
I think if you're

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:13.820
looking at the Mexican history,
obviously there's racism.

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:17.840
They're not looking at white
people to say, you know,

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:24.260
your mother was from here or not
here or whatever they're doing.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.020
And I'm not sure if
I'm making sense.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:30.734
You know, back in the '30s, they
literally just went into places

00:09:30.734 --> 00:09:32.150
and if you were
Mexican, it didn't

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:34.400
matter if you were born here
or you weren't born here.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.780
They didn't look at your papers.

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:38.570
They just rounded people
up on cattle cars,

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:42.320
like my uncle and
his two sisters.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:48.440
My father's cousins
were literally

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.370
rounded up out of first and
second grade and kindergarten,

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:55.320
put on an open cattle
car with their father--

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.700
they were born here as well,
as well as their mother--

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.520
and put on that open
cattle car where it rained

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.370
and they were shipped all the
way down to central Mexico

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:06.950
to make it hard
for them to return.

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:10.550
And they sat in that open
cattle car for days, you know,

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:16.460
shivering and not being
fed and disposed of.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:23.090
There was no compassion for
them or their status at all.

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:25.010
MARCUS GRIMALDO: And
this was in the--

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:26.369
what year time frame?

00:10:26.369 --> 00:10:28.910
MARGARET GARCIA: It was in the
'30s, but what was interesting

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:32.540
with my uncle who was
repatriated, born here,

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:34.190
his mother was here--

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:37.790
he goes down to Mexico and he
says, the only thing I wanted

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:39.650
was to get an education.

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:42.360
All I wanted was an education.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.720
So he goes to the Mexican
schools down there

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.430
and they say, oh, no.

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:47.300
You're an American.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.430
You have an American
birth certificate.

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:54.710
We won't let you take the
place of another Mexican child.

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:56.300
So they wouldn't
educate him here

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:58.590
and they yanked him
out of school there.

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:01.160
So that meant that the
only education he got

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.160
was before they yanked
him out of that classroom

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.386
and took him down there.

00:11:05.386 --> 00:11:06.260
MARCUS GRIMALDO: Wow.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:07.700
And that was in the '30s.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.800
We saw something like
that now, so that's really

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:14.180
something that is interesting.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.610
MARGARET GARCIA: Just
to be fair, I mean,

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:18.560
look at what happened
to the Okies.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.710
Those are white people
crossing the country.

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:26.360
So it isn't-- you know, whether
it's race or class or somebody

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:31.220
trying to find a reason that
you're lesser than human to say

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:34.340
they're taking
something from us.

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:38.630
The Mexicanos who come
here come here to work.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:40.970
They come here to work
and they work hard.

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:43.550
They do jobs that
nobody else wants

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:46.652
and they contribute
to the economy.

00:11:46.652 --> 00:11:47.500
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:48.416
MARCUS GRIMALDO: Yeah.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:51.790
Wow.

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:55.410
Well, I get to see
it on the website

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:56.680
and I love it even in person.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.250
It's just so much more, and
it's so rich, and so many

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:00.000
things for us.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.070
At Google, we're all about
impacting the folks--

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:08.070
the people-- in the best way
possible with our technology,

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:10.110
so these issues are
definitely important to us

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:12.580
here and abroad as well.

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.780
So I'm going to switch gears
a little bit because we've got

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:17.220
a little bit of who you are.

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:20.580
Thank you so much
for sharing with us.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:25.050
We have the artist
that you see here.

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:27.120
Like I said, she
was, I think, highly

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.220
impactful for us and
I think everybody

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.060
has their own connection
to her in some way.

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:32.400
And it's globally, right?

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.380
We saw Drake wearing
a Selena T-shirt.

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.200
We saw Leslie Grace
dominicana wearing a T-shirt.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.560
I mean, support for her has
just been so tremendous,

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.690
generations beyond, right?

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:45.570
And so what was your
inspiration for this

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:47.070
and what about her touched you?

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:48.670
And talk to us.

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:51.940
Can you walk us through that?

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.520
MARGARET GARCIA: Well,
honestly speaking,

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.839
I was approached
by a developer who

00:12:57.839 --> 00:12:59.130
was looking for a piece of art.

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:01.800
You know, there's
the 1% for art,

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.990
and myself, and
two other artists.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:12.780
It was for a location
that dealt with mariachis.

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:18.420
And I said, well, you
need to honor musicians.

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:21.160
And I thought of two people.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:25.170
And the first one was Selena.

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:27.780
The second person
was Lalo Guerrero,

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:34.980
but I really wanted a woman
because oftentimes, there's

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:35.970
not as many of us.

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:37.954
You know what I mean.

00:13:37.954 --> 00:13:40.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:44.680
So you know it's important
to support the women.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.340
And she's beautiful.

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:50.640
She's from Texas where
my grandmother is from.

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:54.030
So I thought she's the one.

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:58.320
She's the one that I need to
honor in this particular way.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.900
I can't dig her up and
ask her to sit for me.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:08.610
I only have the images
that exist of her

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:09.800
as they exist of her.

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:14.670
So it was about me
reinterpreting them and trying

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:17.190
to make it look like a
stained glass window.

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:19.010
And the thing about
stained glass windows

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:23.790
is there's always a
sense of sacredness.

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:27.670
It's a spiritual experience.

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:31.037
And so that's what I went for.

00:14:31.037 --> 00:14:32.370
MARCUS GRIMALDO: That's amazing.

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:34.140
I mean, I got
chills looking at it

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:35.799
because it's just so fantastic.

00:14:35.799 --> 00:14:36.840
And I think you're right.

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.040
I think that's what it was.

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.350
It was like there's
something familiar about it.

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:43.950
I didn't quite know how
to put the pulse on it,

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:45.290
but I think you hit it.

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:46.290
It's very sacred.

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:49.530
You know, you see that
and now that's fantastic.

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:51.360
Now, you mentioned
there's three of them.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.070
We had a chance to
talk before, right?

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:54.153
And you did three of them.

00:14:54.153 --> 00:14:55.154
This was the biggest.

00:14:55.154 --> 00:14:56.070
Who has the other two?

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:56.700
Can you share?

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:56.970
MARGARET GARCIA: I do.

00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:58.170
MARCUS GRIMALDO: Oh, you do.

00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:00.850
OK, who are you saving them for?

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:02.262
I want one.

00:15:02.262 --> 00:15:03.720
MARGARET GARCIA:
They're different.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:07.200
Each one is a little different.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.320
The other two are
done in steel boxes.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:15.000
So I actually try to show
it in the dark instead

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.390
of trying to light it because
the light comes from the back,

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:23.935
and so you don't need to
light it because it glows.

00:15:23.935 --> 00:15:24.810
MARCUS GRIMALDO: Wow.

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:27.660
MARGARET GARCIA: So the boxes
were intended to do that,

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.390
but then I found
this other person

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:35.160
who started talking to me about
shattered plate glass windows.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:39.360
And he was a glass guy and
he talked about the effect.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.640
And he said that I could--

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:49.110
it's called I want to say cold
bonding or cold laminating.

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:50.100
There's a process.

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.080
So he walked me
through that and so

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.570
I put the shattered
glass on the outside.

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:57.480
It makes it tough to
handle, but you're not

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:58.900
supposed to handle it.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:01.620
So if you've got your hands
on my art, take them off.

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:02.542
You'll get cut.

00:16:02.542 --> 00:16:03.750
MARCUS GRIMALDO: No touching.

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:05.100
MARGARET GARCIA: No touching
because you will get cut.

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.225
MARCUS GRIMALDO: Only look.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.470
And then lastly, this is
just one representation

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:16.287
of what she does by the way.

00:16:16.287 --> 00:16:18.120
There's other forms of
expression or artwork

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:18.570
that you have.

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:20.778
Do you want to just kind of
give us a little bit more

00:16:20.778 --> 00:16:21.720
insight to that?

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:25.100
We will have this also posted
on our websites as well locally,

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.910
so for the rest
of the folks that

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:30.075
are watching that are here, stay
tuned because that is to come.

00:16:30.075 --> 00:16:31.560
But I want you to
kind of give us

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:34.770
a little sneak peek
into what to expect.

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:37.140
MARGARET GARCIA:
Well, I've done a lot

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:40.240
of portraits in the beginning.

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.540
And one of the reasons
I've done portraits

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:46.770
is because I felt it was
important for my community

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:50.740
to define ourselves from within
and not be defined by what

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:53.020
the media wants to call us.

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:57.400
So if you see
yourself in the media

00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:01.750
and you're maybe a gardener,
a housekeeper, a gangbanger,

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:03.430
or any of the other
negative things

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:08.470
that I care not to repeat, and
they're talking ill about you,

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:10.990
part of that is because
other people are defining you

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:12.910
and they don't know who you are.

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:15.670
They don't know us.

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:19.660
They don't know us if they think
that we're those things that

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:22.089
have been repeated by 45.

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:23.859
The only thing I can say is--

00:17:26.605 --> 00:17:29.080
my brother is sitting in
the audience right now.

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:31.000
He's a doctor.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.890
He's a trauma surgeon.

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:35.440
We are people who have
accomplished things.

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:40.420
We are people who have done
things and have contributed.

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:44.830
Whether you're talking about
science, innovation, medicine,

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:50.735
arts, we're here and we are
part of the American fabric.

00:17:50.735 --> 00:17:51.860
MARCUS GRIMALDO: Thank you.

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:53.010
Thank you.

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:55.260
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:00.124
All right, Manuel Lopez.

00:18:00.124 --> 00:18:02.040
Sorry, you know, her
story was so good it made

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.792
your back pop off, didn't it?

00:18:03.792 --> 00:18:04.955
MANUEL LOPEZ: Yeah, it did.

00:18:04.955 --> 00:18:06.330
MARCUS GRIMALDO:
It felt it, huh?

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:08.070
The chair even felt it.

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:11.850
Sorry about that, but so
glad to have you here.

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:14.160
Manuel Lopez--
another Angeleno--

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.520
grew up in East Los Angeles.

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:18.510
I read your story.

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:20.806
I don't want to talk too much
because I want to hear it

00:18:20.806 --> 00:18:22.680
from you, but it's so
funny because as a kid,

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:26.460
it started with a
competition with his sister

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:30.120
on a who could draw the
better Trix rabbit--

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.620
bunny rabbit.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.600
And then he ran with
that and he ended up

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.190
getting so excited
about "Mario Kart"

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:38.130
that he painted his whole TV
at his home at eight years old,

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:39.420
I believe--

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:42.030
the whole TV as a Mario canvas.

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:45.430
Mom was not happy.

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:47.620
And then he's been around.

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:49.450
He attended East
Los Angeles college.

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:53.540
He transferred to the School of
the Art Institute of Chicago.

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:55.720
And he was featured in
the "LA Times" article.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:58.060
And that must have been a
big, big moment for you.

00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:00.310
So ladies and gentlemen,
let's give him a warm welcome

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:02.305
of applause and let's
get to know him.

00:19:02.305 --> 00:19:03.520
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:04.645
MANUEL LOPEZ: Thank you.

00:19:04.645 --> 00:19:06.270
MARCUS GRIMALDO: So
Manuel, talk to me.

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:08.936
I kind of gave us the low down--
a little bit about who you are.

00:19:08.936 --> 00:19:11.440
But I mean, I look
at your artwork

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.760
and what you've done here.

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:17.125
And I was telling, I think it
was you as a matter of fact--

00:19:17.125 --> 00:19:18.000
no, Nilza, excuse me.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.834
I was telling Nilza, who is
our business partner here

00:19:21.834 --> 00:19:23.500
and facilitated the
artists coming here,

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:24.400
so thank you so much.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.900
We had a chance to talk, and
I said I feel like this is--

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:30.070
the artwork brings
us kind of here

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:31.700
and there at the same time.

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:34.000
And when I mean that, the
East Los Angeles landscape,

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.230
but it's very reminiscent of
Mexico, at least that's what

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:39.800
I get from this expression.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:44.050
So talk to me about growing
up, how this became something

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:48.580
for you, what you've done,
all the accomplishments you've

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:50.320
done with the Los
Angeles article,

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:53.530
and then where
you plan on going.

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:55.370
MANUEL LOPEZ: Well,
I guess I started

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:58.660
drawing when I was
very young, I mean,

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:02.002
as far as back as
I can remember.

00:20:02.002 --> 00:20:03.460
That was a very
vivid memory that I

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:06.840
have from my childhood when I
used to compete with my sister.

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.580
It was just for the fun of it.

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:12.260
I guess my dad will
get a kick out of it.

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:16.420
So I mean, I always
realize that drawing came

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:19.390
more easy than with other kids.

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:22.980
So it was just-- it
came really easy.

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:27.016
I could just see things
and just put them on paper.

00:20:27.016 --> 00:20:28.390
I never really
took it seriously.

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:30.250
It was always a game to me.

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:34.480
I mean, I just really
enjoyed doing it.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.910
I grew up in Boyle Heights.

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:40.750
And then at about age,
I think, eight or nine,

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:44.650
we moved to East LA.

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:49.630
And I remember, like, moving
the stuff from our old house

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:51.160
to our new house in East LA.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.740
And I remember looking at
the City Terrace hills.

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:55.159
And they just left--

00:20:55.159 --> 00:20:56.950
I don't know, I just
saw them and I thought

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:58.350
they looked really beautiful.

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:06.680
Night came, and the
sun was just setting,

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:11.150
and the lights were turning on.

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:14.480
And I remember saying like,
wow, can this get any better?

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.260
It was to me, it just
really spoke to me.

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.770
And then I started thinking
about the people who

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:20.870
lived up there.

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:23.540
And so I left it at that
for a really long time.

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:27.660
I kept making drawings
after drawing after drawing.

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:32.340
This was from when I
was about 10 to 18.

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:35.620
I never took an art
class in high school.

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:40.550
Well, I went over to ELAC,
met some good people there--

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:43.940
a good instructor by
the name of Jim Uyekawa.

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:49.850
And he just started to put
the idea in me that it's fun,

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:52.070
but also it takes a discipline.

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:55.290
It takes discipline, and it
takes time, and it takes work.

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:59.540
And I was 18, so I didn't
take it too seriously.

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:03.730
You know, like I would
still goof around,

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:05.060
but I still kept at it.

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:10.820
And luckily, a couple years
after I enrolled at ELAC,

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:12.890
I put a portfolio
together and I got

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:17.240
accepted to the School of
the Art Institute of Chicago.

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.740
I had done some research.

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:22.940
I was checking for major
schools that were in the US.

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:25.970
I looked at Rhode
Island School of Design.

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:29.510
I looked at the School of
the Art Institute of Chicago.

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:31.020
Then I took a trip out there.

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:33.260
I visited both campuses.

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:37.670
And the School of the Art
Institute by far was, I mean,

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:41.510
they just had this beautiful
collection of all sorts of art.

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:45.140
And to be able to look at
it while studying, I think

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:52.027
was definitely like a prize
because I love to look at art.

00:22:52.027 --> 00:22:53.110
I mean, I love to make it.

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:56.555
I like to look at it as well.

00:22:56.555 --> 00:22:57.510
What else?

00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:59.780
MARCUS GRIMALDO: So if we
were looking at these three

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:03.080
paintings here, how
does that come about?

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:04.190
What's the inspiration?

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:07.160
I know you mentioned it seems
like landscape is definitely

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:11.090
at the forefront of how you
envision things, and what

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:13.040
inspires you, and what
compels you, right?

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:16.970
So when you start with the
landscape and the vision,

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:18.080
what's that process like?

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:19.880
For us that aren't
artists that don't know,

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.010
but that are super
excited and they're like,

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:25.670
how does something so
simple and beautiful happen?

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:27.290
And is it as easy as it looks?

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:28.970
Is it harder?

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:31.442
Educate us a little bit on that
process, if you don't mind.

00:23:31.442 --> 00:23:32.900
MANUEL LOPEZ: Well,
these paintings

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:35.240
were started off as-- they
started off as drawings.

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:37.700
I usually always work on-site.

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:41.647
I take paper, pencil, and
I spend a couple of times--

00:23:41.647 --> 00:23:43.730
I don't mean a couple of
times-- a couple of hours

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:44.780
up on the hillside.

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:50.810
I mean, I think it's very
meditative to just sit out

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:54.200
there by yourself, and you're
confronting the whole landscape

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:57.300
in front of you, and you
know that you're part of it,

00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:59.471
and you're looking
at these houses which

00:23:59.471 --> 00:24:03.890
hold people that
are contributing

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:07.790
to the American society.

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:11.690
And so just like Margaret
said that our lives are not

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:12.650
in the media--

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:14.190
in the popular media--

00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:16.160
you know, I mean, those
houses hold everything

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:19.610
from the gangster
to the mechanic that

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:22.550
works 80 hours a week.

00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:26.510
And just being up there
as the sun is setting,

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:29.540
those hills just come alive.

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:31.257
You get people
coming in from work.

00:24:31.257 --> 00:24:32.840
You have kids running
down the street.

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:36.460
You have the paletero
selling his stuff.

00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:40.310
You have the paisas coming
along with the Chalino blasting.

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:43.807
And you smell the carne asada
and it just it feels good.

00:24:43.807 --> 00:24:44.640
It feels, you know--

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:47.360
and I'm part of it, you know.

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.370
When I look at them--

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:50.078
like a lot of people
have been telling me

00:24:50.078 --> 00:24:53.270
that it reminds them of Mexico,
but I mean, I've been to Mexico

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:55.860
and it doesn't really
remind me of Mexico.

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:58.370
But I mean, to each his own.

00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:02.900
But I mean, I think
when I'm making this,

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:07.050
I'm aware that I come
from Southern California

00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:09.800
and I love--

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.810
I came across David Hockney's
work some years ago.

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:14.870
And I love the way
he captures light.

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:18.410
And so I'm aware that I
come from that tradition.

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:20.270
Even though he's
from England, he

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:24.140
landed in Southern California
and he made Southern California

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:25.847
his playground.

00:25:25.847 --> 00:25:27.680
I'm looking at other
artists like Ed Ruscha.

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:31.520
I'm looking at the
artists that I couldn't

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:35.120
see when I was younger because
I was walking on the streets

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:38.090
and I would see a
mural by Frank Romero.

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:40.730
I would see a mural
by David Botello.

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:45.630
So in a way, like
when I saw Hockney,

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:47.370
it was something new for me.

00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:52.070
So these guys right here,
I think more than anything,

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:53.570
I think they're
Southern California.

00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:55.340
I think they're
Southern California.

00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:57.290
I'm trying to capture the sun.

00:25:57.290 --> 00:26:02.540
I'm trying to capture
the palm trees, I think.

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:05.460
I think just when you
look at the landscape,

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:11.530
I think I get excited by looking
at all the different trees,

00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:13.340
at all the different life forms.

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:16.460
This is their environment and
we're part of it, you know.

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:17.030
MARCUS GRIMALDO:
Yeah, I love that.

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:18.710
It's like you said it
was meditative to you.

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:21.110
I think it's very therapeutic
for us here just listening

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:21.610
to that.

00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:25.100
And then even more exciting
and honorable on your behalf

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:28.610
is that you're representing that
community to the fullest in one

00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:30.084
of the most unique ways.

00:26:30.084 --> 00:26:31.500
Like, not everybody
could do that,

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:33.662
so that's absolutely fantastic.

00:26:33.662 --> 00:26:34.620
I want to switch gears.

00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:36.680
I do want to talk about
the "LA Times" article.

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:38.360
I think that's a
huge accomplishment.

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:39.520
I had a chance--

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:42.210
an opportunity to read
it multiple times.

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:43.290
How did that happen?

00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:44.180
Did you expect that?

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:47.870
Did you ever think that at
this time in your career,

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:48.560
it would happen?

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:52.160
I mean, you seem pretty young,
so that's a big accomplishment

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.260
to get that visibility,
that presence.

00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:55.010
That's awesome.

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:57.200
And again, you are
the LA story, right?

00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:00.005
And so what better
way to have somebody

00:27:00.005 --> 00:27:02.630
highlight that and showcase than
the "LA Times" article, right?

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:05.220
So can you talk us
through that journey,

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:07.340
and how it happened,
when it happened,

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:09.830
what does it mean, has
it been impactful for you

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:10.580
as an artist--

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:11.090
your career?

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.900
MANUEL LOPEZ: So the
story came about like,

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:18.500
I usually like, kick it with
friends that are into the arts.

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:20.420
Like, they do
photography or they drum.

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:24.950
And we go hit up the hills.

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:27.346
We'll go up there for
a couple of hours.

00:27:27.346 --> 00:27:28.970
And then one of them
is a photographer.

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:31.700
His name is Rafael Cardenas.

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:34.160
And he tells me one day, hey,
let me follow you around.

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:37.070
Let me, you know, just
pretend I'm not even there.

00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:38.250
You do your thing.

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:40.434
And I'll try to stay
out of your way.

00:27:40.434 --> 00:27:41.600
And I'm like, well, fuck it.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:42.630
Let's do it.

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:44.270
So we went up.

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:47.910
He followed me around for
maybe like about seven hours.

00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:48.980
You know?

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:51.950
We hit up three different
spots in City Terrace.

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:54.950
No, two spots in City
Terrace, one in Elysian Park.

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:57.599
So we went around.

00:27:57.599 --> 00:27:59.015
He said, like,
hey, man, I'm going

00:27:59.015 --> 00:28:01.610
to do like a little video
montage of everything

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:02.929
I captured.

00:28:02.929 --> 00:28:03.970
I'm like, go for it, man.

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:05.636
Just make me look--
you know, look good.

00:28:05.636 --> 00:28:06.410
You know?

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:08.400
So he's like, dude, I
don't promise anything.

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:08.900
You know?

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:10.945
And I'm like, no, I'm
just messing around, man.

00:28:10.945 --> 00:28:12.070
Do whatever you need to do.

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:14.130
And he-- you know, he--

00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:15.597
a couple months pass.

00:28:15.597 --> 00:28:16.930
I didn't hear anything from him.

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:20.050
And then like, out of the blue,
he tells me, you know what?

00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:22.900
I'm done with the editing.

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:25.150
And if you want to check
it out, come through.

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:25.942
I stopped by.

00:28:25.942 --> 00:28:26.650
I checked it out.

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:27.358
I was like, damn.

00:28:27.358 --> 00:28:28.870
Like, I was--

00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:31.330
I think the way he just
filmed everything was really,

00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:34.480
it was amazing.

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:39.460
There was beautiful music in the
background by some guy, Arenas.

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:42.310
I don't know if you guys
have heard of Chicano Batman?

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:43.230
Yeah, so he goes--

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:44.380
MARCUS GRIMALDO:
I'm hearing some--

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:45.255
yeah, so [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:45.255 --> 00:28:46.390
I gotta check him out.

00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:48.750
MANUEL LOPEZ: He did
the background music

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:50.890
and beautifully composed.

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:51.700
You know?

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:53.240
He puts it on his website.

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:55.247
And I'm like, OK,
that's cool, you know?

00:28:55.247 --> 00:28:56.080
Like, I was really--

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:56.913
I was happy for him.

00:28:56.913 --> 00:29:01.900
Because it was his first
like editing video.

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:05.950
Because he's usually
shooting photos.

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:10.180
And so a couple of weeks
after he puts it online,

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:12.880
I get a call from my girlfriend.

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.510
And she tells me, you know what?

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:16.270
Like, Rafael just called me up.

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:19.199
And he tells me to tell
you to check your email.

00:29:19.199 --> 00:29:20.240
I don't have a cellphone.

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.750
I've been cellphone-free
for about seven years.

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:23.875
MARCUS GRIMALDO: I'm sorry?

00:29:23.875 --> 00:29:25.650
Wait, can you say
that one more--

00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:27.416
wait, did I hear that correctly?

00:29:27.416 --> 00:29:28.540
You don't have a cellphone?

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:30.657
And you haven't had a
cellphone for seven years?

00:29:30.657 --> 00:29:31.740
MANUEL LOPEZ: Seven years.

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:32.630
Yeah.

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:35.320
MARCUS GRIMALDO: Wow.

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:38.110
MANUEL LOPEZ: So every time
people want to contact me--

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:39.490
MARCUS GRIMALDO: They've got
to go through the girlfriend.

00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:40.780
MANUEL LOPEZ: I
don't even know, man.

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:42.154
I don't know how
they do it, man.

00:29:42.154 --> 00:29:43.727
It's pretty amazing.

00:29:43.727 --> 00:29:44.810
They get to track me down.

00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:45.310
You know?

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:47.770
But anyways, so
I check my email.

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:52.395
And then I read the email from,
her name is Esmeralda Bermudez.

00:29:52.395 --> 00:29:55.270
And she tells me, you
know, I saw Rafael's video.

00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:57.430
And I was wondering if
I could interview you

00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:59.590
for a future piece.

00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:02.200
And at first, I didn't
know what to think.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.836
Because I was like,
wow, the "LA Times."

00:30:04.836 --> 00:30:07.630
So I'm like, well, yeah,
let's make it happen.

00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:09.300
She hits me up.

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:10.450
We go to the local cafe.

00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:12.350
She interviews me
for about two hours.

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:13.264
MARCUS GRIMALDO: Wow.

00:30:13.264 --> 00:30:14.930
MANUEL LOPEZ: I'm
like, OK, that's cool.

00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:16.300
We went into it.

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:17.000
We spoke.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:17.890
We had lunch.

00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:20.576
We drank coffee.

00:30:20.576 --> 00:30:22.450
And then she's like,
oh, this is really good.

00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:23.450
When can we do it again?

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:25.120
So I'm like, what the fuck?

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:26.371
Dude, we did two hours.

00:30:26.371 --> 00:30:27.370
And then she wants more?

00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:29.590
I'm like, let's do it next week.

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:31.480
And she's like, all right.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.190
And then we do that.

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:34.930
And then again, hey,
let's do it again.

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:36.400
I'm like, dang.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:36.940
All right.

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:38.440
So two more hours
and then I don't

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:39.610
know how many times we met.

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:41.440
But it was just really good.

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.507
Like it was--

00:30:42.507 --> 00:30:44.590
I guess the word I want
to use is kind of therapy.

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:48.190
Because she was really trying
to go deep into the practice

00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:50.390
and why I do what I do.

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:53.450
And I mean, it was a really
beautiful experience.

00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:56.621
And then she's
like, OK, it's over.

00:30:56.621 --> 00:30:58.870
And then she's like, I'm
going to bring the "LA Times"

00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:59.411
photographer.

00:30:59.411 --> 00:31:01.030
I'm like, what?

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:02.110
MARCUS GRIMALDO: Oh, so you
didn't know the whole time

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:03.000
it was for "LA Times?"

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.450
MANUEL LOPEZ: Well, I knew
it was from the "LA Times."

00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:06.990
But I didn't know that they
were going to be shooting.

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:08.990
MARCUS GRIMALDO: Oh,
and when was this?

00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:10.300
MANUEL LOPEZ: This was
a couple of months ago.

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:10.670
I think April.

00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:11.670
MARCUS GRIMALDO: Oh,
this was very recent.

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:12.910
MANUEL LOPEZ: April, yeah.

00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:13.840
MARCUS GRIMALDO: That's awesome.

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:14.320
And it's out.

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:14.920
This is public.

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:15.795
People can go online.

00:31:15.795 --> 00:31:18.670
MANUEL LOPEZ: Yeah, it's
on the "LA Times" link.

00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:20.980
And so she brings the
photographer over.

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:25.454
And I'm like, dude, I'm going to
take you guys up to the hills.

00:31:25.454 --> 00:31:26.620
That's my natural landscape.

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:27.490
You know?

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:29.470
And so we take the
photographer up there.

00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:33.980
And he's setting up his
flashes and all that stuff.

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:35.650
And he's like, all
right, just sit down.

00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:36.650
You know, do your thing.

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:38.830
And then I start drawing.

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:39.820
She's like behind me.

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:42.010
She's like still
asking me questions.

00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:44.350
And then the photographer,
after we're all done,

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:47.110
he's like hanging off the
side of the cliff trying

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:49.587
to take a good shot of me.

00:31:49.587 --> 00:31:52.045
And then very seriously after
we're done, he comes up to me

00:31:52.045 --> 00:31:53.320
and he tells, hey,
man, you know what?

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:54.310
I've been to Iraq.

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:55.940
I've been to Baghdad.

00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:59.215
He's like, but this is the
hardest excitement ever, man.

00:31:59.215 --> 00:32:02.200
MARCUS GRIMALDO: Wow,
you deserve a round

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:03.562
of applause for that one.

00:32:03.562 --> 00:32:04.930
That's awesome.

00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:05.830
That's great.

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:08.860
So what are we to expect next?

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:11.110
Is there another article
that's coming out?

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:14.470
Are you kind of just taking
a break from, you know,

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:16.090
and working on the
next inspiration?

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:17.224
What's the--

00:32:17.224 --> 00:32:19.390
MANUEL LOPEZ: After that
article, I had a solo show.

00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:22.420
I had my first solo show at
Eastern Projects in Chinatown.

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:23.470
MARCUS GRIMALDO: Wow, OK.

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:26.140
Is there any more coming up
that we should be aware of here?

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:27.850
MANUEL LOPEZ: Well, I mean,
I'm pretty sure something

00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:28.975
will come up in the future.

00:32:28.975 --> 00:32:30.700
But for right now
I'm just working.

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:31.700
MARCUS GRIMALDO: Got it.

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:33.841
MANUEL LOPEZ: And there's
several exhibitions

00:32:33.841 --> 00:32:34.840
that are being lined up.

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:41.170
But I mean, if you guys want
to follow me on Instagram,

00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:44.929
it's M-E-A-U-N-L. And
I'll be posting stuff up.

00:32:44.929 --> 00:32:45.970
I mean, it's just a plug.

00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:47.680
But fuck, you might as
well take advantage.

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:48.160
You know?

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:49.090
MARCUS GRIMALDO: You
beat me to the punch.

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:50.200
I was like, we're
going to do-- we're

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:51.324
going to do all that stuff.

00:32:51.324 --> 00:32:52.870
MANUEL LOPEZ:
Well, yeah, I mean,

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:54.440
I just don't want to
say it like right now.

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:55.731
Because it's just in the works.

00:32:55.731 --> 00:32:59.340
And I mean, I feel like it's
good stuff that's coming.

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:00.690
You know?

00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:04.290
I mean, I've been at
this for a lot of years,

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:07.540
quietly just working
and working and working.

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:09.570
And I think that's
like the thing.

00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:12.710
I mean, the thing is
that for that show,

00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:14.985
I put in a bunch of drawings.

00:33:14.985 --> 00:33:16.360
And everybody was
telling me, you

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:17.700
know, oh, these are beautiful.

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:18.283
They're great.

00:33:18.283 --> 00:33:19.159
And I was like, oh.

00:33:19.159 --> 00:33:20.200
Like, don't get me wrong.

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:21.533
I thought that was really great.

00:33:21.533 --> 00:33:24.209
But it's just like
after the show,

00:33:24.209 --> 00:33:26.000
it's just like it's
crazy when it hits you.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.660
You know, it's like, for
every successful drawing,

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:32.720
there was 30 drawings
that didn't make it.

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.516
You know what I mean?

00:33:34.516 --> 00:33:35.690
So I think it's just work.

00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:38.500
Like, you just need to
work and work and work.

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:41.639
And I mean, something good
eventually will come out of it.

00:33:41.639 --> 00:33:42.680
MARCUS GRIMALDO: I agree.

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:43.180
I agree.

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:44.340
And we're here to support you.

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:45.640
So we look forward
to hearing when

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:46.670
the next thing is happening.

00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:49.030
And we're going to exchange
social media, Twitter, all

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:51.090
that fun stuff in a little bit.

00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:56.230
But I'm going to go ahead and
introduce our final artist,

00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:58.106
SeÃ±or Antonio Pelayo.

00:33:58.106 --> 00:33:59.480
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:01.646
Let's give him a warm
welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

00:34:01.646 --> 00:34:03.386
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:03.386 --> 00:34:04.510
ANTONIO PELAYO: Is this on?

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:05.800
MARCUS GRIMALDO: Is it on?

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:06.220
ANTONIO PELAYO: Yeah, right?

00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:06.760
MARCUS GRIMALDO: There we go.

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:07.720
Yeah, sounds good.

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:10.480
So I was reading up on you too.

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:14.800
And we had a chance to talk
a little bit before, as well.

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:17.860
You have a very, very
interesting background.

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:22.210
Again, being here, there,
so from Glendale to Mexico,

00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:26.560
back to Glendale, and then
the whole Disney experience.

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:27.310
Right?

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:28.420
A lot to unpack there.

00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:34.000
I think you describe
yourself as an illustrator

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.040
and a hyper-realist, right?

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.320
And then when we look
at this piece here,

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:41.917
it represents what you
called photorealism.

00:34:41.917 --> 00:34:43.250
So we have a lot to unpack here.

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:44.590
So talk to me.

00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:48.429
Talk to me about the evolution
of you, your artistry.

00:34:48.429 --> 00:34:51.345
And then we can go from there.

00:34:51.345 --> 00:34:55.250
ANTONIO PELAYO: Well to
make a long story short,

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:57.835
I used to live in Highland Park
and I used to go to preschool.

00:34:57.835 --> 00:35:01.520
The preschool was right
across from our house.

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:04.384
And in preschool,
all we did was art.

00:35:04.384 --> 00:35:06.550
So I started drawing since
I was like, I don't know,

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:07.216
three years old.

00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:11.500
Shortly after that,
my mom started

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:15.175
studying with a religious
group that's very--

00:35:15.175 --> 00:35:19.150
I don't want to say
the name of the group.

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:20.810
I don't want to offend anyone.

00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:24.040
But it's a very difficult
religion to be a part of.

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:28.760
Due to that, my dad sent us
to Mexico to their small town.

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.970
It's called [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:34.570
Back in '79, I don't know,
maybe a couple hundred people

00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:35.330
lived there.

00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:37.570
And that's where both
my parents are from.

00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:42.220
So he sent us there with
the intention of the family

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:45.520
to turn my mom and
my sisters and myself

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:48.010
back to being Catholic.

00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:51.460
We were the only ones
from that religion there.

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:53.410
But instead of that
happening, my mom

00:35:53.410 --> 00:35:55.915
became a stronger
member of that religion.

00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:02.320
So we were in Mexico
from '79 to '89.

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:05.110
During that time, being
part of that religion,

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:07.210
you're not allowed to
associate or hang out

00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:10.120
with anyone else that's
not part of that religion.

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:11.870
So I really had no friends.

00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:14.215
So my only friend
really was me drawing.

00:36:14.215 --> 00:36:17.860
I would just lock myself up
and draw, and draw all day.

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:20.220
And so that's most of
what I did in Mexico,

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:22.390
and be part of that religion.

00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:24.490
I mean, I was running
congregations when I was,

00:36:24.490 --> 00:36:26.960
like, 15 years old.

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:30.610
So it's now '89.

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:32.350
We came back to the States.

00:36:32.350 --> 00:36:36.730
And we weren't supposed
to come back and stay.

00:36:36.730 --> 00:36:38.924
My mom just one day
told my dad, you know,

00:36:38.924 --> 00:36:40.340
we're going to
come and visit you.

00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:42.100
And I was supposed
to stay in Mexico.

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:44.270
But then everyone started
crying the night before.

00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:47.170
And then everyone's like,
all right, pack your stuff.

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:48.950
We're going to take you with us.

00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:50.050
So we came here.

00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:52.330
And we ended up just staying.

00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:56.350
So shortly after that,
right out of high school,

00:36:56.350 --> 00:37:01.150
I got hired by Disney in
a very small department,

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:04.330
a department that
was started back

00:37:04.330 --> 00:37:06.400
in the '20s by Walt Disney.

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:09.580
And that department was
all women back then.

00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:10.125
And so--

00:37:10.125 --> 00:37:11.990
MARCUS GRIMALDO: Oh,
that's different.

00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.170
ANTONIO PELAYO: Yeah.

00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:12.730
MARCUS GRIMALDO: Right?

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:13.980
ANTONIO PELAYO: It's so weird.

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:17.530
Because I don't know.

00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:20.890
The department's going
to turn 100 in 2023.

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:24.707
Forward to today, now
that department's all men.

00:37:24.707 --> 00:37:25.540
MARCUS GRIMALDO: Oh.

00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:29.150
ANTONIO PELAYO: Yeah, they just
hired my son about a year ago.

00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:30.774
And then we hired
another gentleman.

00:37:30.774 --> 00:37:33.190
MARCUS GRIMALDO: And that's
the ink and paint department--

00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:34.030
ANTONIO PELAYO: Ink and
paint department, yeah.

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:34.960
MARCUS GRIMALDO: --you were
just talking about, right?

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:35.620
ANTONIO PELAYO: Yeah.

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:37.600
MARCUS GRIMALDO: For us,
again, we're not artists here.

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:38.610
Well, I'm not definitely.

00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:40.610
And I don't know if anybody
else in the audience is.

00:37:40.610 --> 00:37:41.470
But I'm definitely
not an artist.

00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:43.600
I would like to know
well, what does that mean?

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:46.720
Because I look at your paintings
just off of your website,

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:49.739
for example, and it's
so different than what

00:37:49.739 --> 00:37:50.530
I'm used to seeing.

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:51.029
Right?

00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:55.664
Talk to me about that,
ink and paint department.

00:37:55.664 --> 00:37:57.580
ANTONIO PELAYO: Well,
the inking and painting,

00:37:57.580 --> 00:37:58.900
I don't exhibit that.

00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:00.350
That's just what
I do for Disney.

00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:01.350
MARCUS GRIMALDO: Oh, OK.

00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:03.740
ANTONIO PELAYO: My
personal stuff is pencil.

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:06.070
And this piece in
particular is not pencil.

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:08.500
But it's from my pencil drawing.

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:12.334
It's a collaboration I
did with Richard Duardo.

00:38:12.334 --> 00:38:13.500
MARCUS GRIMALDO: I saw that.

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:15.010
ANTONIO PELAYO: So
that's his touch there.

00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:16.340
MARCUS GRIMALDO: Yeah,
this is your collaboration.

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:16.839
OK, good.

00:38:16.839 --> 00:38:19.290
Because I saw the pencil art
that you have on your website

00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:20.079
for this.

00:38:20.079 --> 00:38:21.120
And then we saw this one.

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:22.244
And I was researching this.

00:38:22.244 --> 00:38:23.610
It's a collaboration piece.

00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:29.440
As an artist, is it different
being in a collaboration piece?

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:31.800
Because it seems when you
have your own artistry,

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.370
it's very individualistic.

00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:35.700
It's very like, no,
this is like my story.

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:36.400
I'm proud of it.

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:40.217
It's not like you're
not segregating yourself

00:38:40.217 --> 00:38:41.800
from somebody because
of your beliefs.

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.341
But you're just
proud of what you do.

00:38:43.341 --> 00:38:46.440
So how was this experience being
that it was a collaboration

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:49.830
piece, and being an artist?

00:38:49.830 --> 00:38:52.440
ANTONIO PELAYO: Well,
Richard saw my work.

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:54.940
And he said, we need
to do a collaboration.

00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:57.330
So I told him, well, what piece?

00:38:57.330 --> 00:38:58.590
I'll let you choose the piece.

00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:00.540
And he chose Frida.

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:04.540
So I mean, I think that
collaboration was a lot of fun.

00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:05.820
I admire Richard.

00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:09.712
He became one of my mentors.

00:39:09.712 --> 00:39:10.920
MARCUS GRIMALDO: That's good.

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:11.770
So nothing changed.

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:12.270
That's good.

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:13.440
Because, you know,
sometimes you collaborate.

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:15.050
And it doesn't always--

00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:16.860
it doesn't always end
with a mentorship.

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:17.100
Right?

00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:17.400
ANTONIO PELAYO: Yeah.

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:18.180
MARCUS GRIMALDO:
So that's awesome.

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:19.380
ANTONIO PELAYO: No,
Richard was awesome.

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:20.220
MARCUS GRIMALDO: OK.

00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:22.984
And why did he choose
the Frida Kahlo?

00:39:22.984 --> 00:39:24.900
ANTONIO PELAYO: Probably
because of, you know,

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:27.660
she's such an iconic,
just like Selena.

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:32.250
And she's inspired a
lot of us as artists.

00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:33.990
She was one of my
inspirations growing up

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:38.890
in Mexico, her, Diego, all
the muralists from Mexico.

00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:39.390
Yeah.

00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:40.723
MARCUS GRIMALDO: That's awesome.

00:39:40.723 --> 00:39:42.889
And what's the next
big thing for you?

00:39:42.889 --> 00:39:44.430
Are you working on
anything right now

00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:45.960
that we should be aware of?

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:46.961
Are you still at Disney?

00:39:46.961 --> 00:39:48.876
Is there something new
that you're trying out?

00:39:48.876 --> 00:39:51.030
Is there more collaborations
that we should expect?

00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:53.550
ANTONIO PELAYO: Still at Disney.

00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:58.200
Currently, I'm working to
expand my Familia series.

00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:01.860
And it was a documentation of my
family's migration from Mexico.

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:03.840
I have a part one
and part two on that.

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:06.510
And I plan on expanding on that.

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:11.280
And also, I do some
lucha libre pieces

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:12.447
that I'm experimenting with.

00:40:12.447 --> 00:40:13.863
MARCUS GRIMALDO:
That's fantastic.

00:40:13.863 --> 00:40:16.470
So I'm going to lead us into
the theme, as I mentioned--

00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:17.100
[SPANISH]

00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:17.380
Right?

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:19.620
That's kind of where we're
at with Hispanic Heritage

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:23.310
Month and the theme that we want
to convey throughout Hispanic

00:40:23.310 --> 00:40:24.240
Heritage Month.

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:26.850
So when you look
at your artwork,

00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:29.040
if you had to choose
one of your paintings

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:32.130
or your artistic expressions--

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:34.000
I don't want to say
the wrong words here--

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.760
but if you had to
choose one thing that

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:39.300
would be representative of
that, what would it be and why?

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:42.310
And what does that mean to you?

00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:46.110
ANTONIO PELAYO: For me, I
think, from Mi Familia series.

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:48.090
I mean, I would say all of them.

00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:49.920
But one in particular
would probably

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:56.130
be a portrait of my
dad and his cousin.

00:40:56.130 --> 00:40:58.860
And I got it from a
photo that they took.

00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:04.320
And it was taken the day
they got deported from LA.

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:06.340
And it was a photo
taken in Mexico.

00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:08.460
So I drew that.

00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:13.680
So that, to me, you
know, meant a lot.

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:16.890
I can relate in some ways
because I migrated to Mexico.

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:19.210
And then I migrated back here.

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:23.040
And I wanted--

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:26.770
I wanted to play
with that message

00:41:26.770 --> 00:41:30.360
and to show people
like the things

00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:33.750
that we go through
as immigrants, things

00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:37.984
that we feel, like feeling
lost in another country.

00:41:37.984 --> 00:41:39.900
MARCUS GRIMALDO: Yeah,
I was going to ask you.

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:43.110
That must have had a profound
effect on you, being so young

00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:44.900
and going through
that experience.

00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:47.489
I mean, I hate
moving myself now.

00:41:47.489 --> 00:41:49.530
I can't even imagine what
it would have been like

00:41:49.530 --> 00:41:50.970
as a child, right?

00:41:50.970 --> 00:41:54.360
ANTONIO PELAYO: Well, imagine
going to your hometown

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:59.010
and no one there likes
you because you're not

00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:02.040
part of their religion.

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:04.830
And then coming back here,
I lost all the friends

00:42:04.830 --> 00:42:05.940
that I had.

00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:08.059
So I had no friends here.

00:42:08.059 --> 00:42:08.850
I'm in high school.

00:42:08.850 --> 00:42:11.890
And I hated school
for those reasons.

00:42:11.890 --> 00:42:14.010
And when I came back
here, my English was shot.

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:19.674
So they put me in ESL for
about a year until I caught up.

00:42:19.674 --> 00:42:21.840
MARCUS GRIMALDO: So imagination
was your best friend

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:22.510
and the pencil.

00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:23.830
ANTONIO PELAYO:
Pretty much, yeah.

00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:24.230
MARCUS GRIMALDO: Awesome.

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:25.724
Thank you for sharing.

00:42:25.724 --> 00:42:28.060
Margaret?

00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:28.680
[SPANISH]

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:29.380
MARGARET GARCIA: [SPANISH].

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:31.130
MARCUS GRIMALDO: What
does it mean to you?

00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:34.150
What painting, or
expression, or artistic--

00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:36.490
I mean, you gave
us a great intro,

00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:40.750
a lot of strong themes here
that were very close to us, just

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:42.190
being [INAUDIBLE] in general.

00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:44.320
What would be your answer
to that question, as far

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:48.940
as the theme that we're trying
to convey here and your art?

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:50.680
MARGARET GARCIA:
The public artwork

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:54.550
that I did for the Universal
Studios metro station.

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:58.885
Because it covers the
history of the Mexicano here

00:42:58.885 --> 00:43:02.050
and in California,
and how California

00:43:02.050 --> 00:43:04.870
became a part of
the United States,

00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:07.720
and how it was part of Mexico.

00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:11.470
And I worked on that
particular project--

00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:15.860
I mean, from beginning to end,
it was a span of 10 years.

00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:19.240
And I had a
historian, Bill Mason,

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:23.200
who worked for the Museum of
Natural History, who provided

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:27.400
me with a lot of the research in
order to get that history down.

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:31.960
And it covers that
period of history.

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:34.790
So I would have to go with that.

00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:39.301
But other than that, I would
have to say my next painting.

00:43:39.301 --> 00:43:41.410
MARCUS GRIMALDO: Uh
oh, I like that, next.

00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:43.260
And how do we--

00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:45.040
can you give us some kind of--

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:47.200
MARGARET GARCIA: I'm
expected to do a solo show

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:49.900
at the Museum of Ventura--

00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:55.720
in the Ventura Museum of
Art in 2020, in the fall.

00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:57.040
MARCUS GRIMALDO: OK, all right.

00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:00.390
Well, we've got to stay
updated and stay close to that

00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:01.975
because that's very exciting.

00:44:01.975 --> 00:44:03.100
So congratulations on that.

00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:04.900
And we can't wait
for that to happen.

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:06.480
MARGARET GARCIA: Thank you.

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:10.422
MARCUS GRIMALDO: Sir, your turn.

00:44:10.422 --> 00:44:12.284
MANUEL LOPEZ: Favorite piece?

00:44:12.284 --> 00:44:14.200
MARCUS GRIMALDO: Favorite
piece in the context

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:18.330
of like [SPANISH],, hear me,
what that means for you.

00:44:18.330 --> 00:44:20.740
Again, it could be
a political sense.

00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:24.040
It could be just
a personal stance.

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:25.720
It could be motivational.

00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:29.079
I mean, I don't want to get to--

00:44:29.079 --> 00:44:30.370
make it a contract or anything.

00:44:30.370 --> 00:44:33.580
But I'd like to know if,
you know, given where we're

00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:37.401
at with hear me, [SPANISH],,
and the state of where we're

00:44:37.401 --> 00:44:37.900
at today.

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:38.800
You've heard the stories.

00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:39.799
You have your narrative.

00:44:39.799 --> 00:44:41.650
If you had to
choose one painting,

00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:44.776
or artistic expression,
that you have,

00:44:44.776 --> 00:44:45.900
what would that be and why?

00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:52.190
MANUEL LOPEZ: I did what
is it, like a dictionary

00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:54.552
back in second
grade, where we did

00:44:54.552 --> 00:44:55.760
every letter in the alphabet.

00:44:55.760 --> 00:45:00.110
And then we had to pick like
nine drawings for each letter.

00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:03.590
And my mom just barely found
it a couple of months ago.

00:45:03.590 --> 00:45:05.480
And we sat down.

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:06.650
And we just went through it.

00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:11.210
And I mean, I think
that was pretty special

00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:14.400
because you're being
introduced through a language.

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:18.160
Like, I feel like
my English is very--

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:19.880
it's not-- I mean,
I was born here.

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:22.070
But I grew up as
a Spanish speaker

00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:23.970
so I still have that
very heavy accent.

00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:27.890
And I'm just going
through the alphabet

00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:29.150
in the English language.

00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:32.130
And I threw in a bunch of like--

00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:33.530
I threw in some
nopales in there.

00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:35.300
I threw in some [SPANISH].

00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:38.000
So just to know that you
could interplay, you know,

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.950
the cultures, and to know
that it's OK to do that.

00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:44.589
You know, I thought that was--

00:45:44.589 --> 00:45:46.130
I mean, just in
retrospect, you know,

00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:50.360
seeing that a couple of months
ago, and it makes it OK.

00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:54.140
And I just was just really happy
that my mom took care of it

00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:57.210
after all these years.

00:45:57.210 --> 00:45:59.660
Yeah, I think that one
definitely probably speaks--

00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:04.700
MARCUS GRIMALDO: Wow, second
grade, I mean, that's crazy.

00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:05.945
That's awesome.

00:46:05.945 --> 00:46:07.660
MANUEL LOPEZ: Yeah, it was.

00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:09.410
MARCUS GRIMALDO:
That's fantastic.

00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:10.820
Wow, that's incredible.

00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:12.810
Well, I think we have some time.

00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:15.860
I want to open the floor up to
questions because, you know,

00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:18.620
I had my own kind
of narrative here

00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:21.730
of how I wanted to get this
and illustrate this talk.

00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:24.390
But I know we want to hear some
from the audience, as well.

00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:27.267
So we have time to go ahead
and do some little Q&amp;A

00:46:27.267 --> 00:46:28.100
A from the audience.

00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:29.085
Right?

00:46:29.085 --> 00:46:29.960
All right, excellent.

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:31.640
So anybody have any--

00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:35.210
oh, actually, as a matter of
fact, to make it even more fun,

00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:38.780
we have this really cool ball,
or actually cube, I should say,

00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:39.812
I'm going to throw.

00:46:39.812 --> 00:46:40.520
Thank you, Nilza.

00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:45.470
So if anyone wants it ask
a question, get input,

00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:46.070
we're here.

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:49.624
We're opening up the floor.

00:46:49.624 --> 00:46:50.790
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:51.770
MARCUS GRIMALDO: Yes.

00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:55.340
AUDIENCE: So if you
wanted to make some news,

00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:57.560
what would that piece be about?

00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:02.210
You want to make some news.

00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:04.250
You're going to
break some barriers.

00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:05.765
What would that piece be?

00:47:05.765 --> 00:47:07.640
MARCUS GRIMALDO: You
want to make some noise.

00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:09.290
Like, you're really going to--

00:47:09.290 --> 00:47:10.370
AUDIENCE: Like you're going
to break some barriers.

00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:11.911
MARCUS GRIMALDO:
Media's going to go.

00:47:11.911 --> 00:47:12.780
Blogs are going off.

00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:14.730
ANTONIO PELAYO: This
one's good for Margaret.

00:47:14.730 --> 00:47:19.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:22.380
MARGARET GARCIA: I think that
if I wanted to make some news--

00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:25.740
if I wanted to make
some news, then I

00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:29.730
would want to make news because
it was worth making news about.

00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:30.720
Right?

00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:35.070
And right now, it just
seems that the things that

00:47:35.070 --> 00:47:39.450
get the most news are not the
things that I particularly

00:47:39.450 --> 00:47:41.470
care to hear about.

00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:46.350
I'm oversaturated with
a lot of negativity

00:47:46.350 --> 00:47:51.280
and the ill doings of people
that I don't care for.

00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:53.280
And so if I wanted
to bring news,

00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:56.250
I would want to bring
news to those people

00:47:56.250 --> 00:48:03.340
in those situations,
you know, Standing Rock,

00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:07.870
the earth, the water,
the ecology, and also

00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:09.200
the positive things.

00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:13.690
There are many people looking
for solutions in small villages

00:48:13.690 --> 00:48:17.110
in Africa, in India, in Mexico.

00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:19.660
There are people
who are invested

00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:25.300
in STEAM, Science, Technology,
Engineering, Art, and Math.

00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:29.260
There are people who are
trying to find solutions.

00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:31.600
And artists are a part
of that, whether you're

00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:37.150
talking about gentrification or
you're talking about education

00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:39.820
or you're talking about ecology.

00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:45.400
So for me, it's about
investing in that aspect.

00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:47.620
What project?

00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:50.120
I just got the East
Side Initiative.

00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:52.840
It's called Creating
Cultural Currency.

00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:55.600
We're interested in
creating art that

00:48:55.600 --> 00:49:00.130
helps to teach people skills
so they can get a job,

00:49:00.130 --> 00:49:04.120
so that they can go out
there and work using arts,

00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:07.520
using science, to
solve those problems.

00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:08.620
That's what I'm about.

00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:11.241
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:11.241 --> 00:49:12.990
MARCUS GRIMALDO: You
sound like a googler.

00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:13.910
MARGARET GARCIA: A what?

00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:15.230
MARCUS GRIMALDO: You
sound like a googler.

00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:15.680
Yeah.

00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:17.263
MARGARET GARCIA: I
am a heavy googler.

00:49:17.263 --> 00:49:18.822
MARCUS GRIMALDO: I love it.

00:49:18.822 --> 00:49:20.030
What about you two over here?

00:49:20.030 --> 00:49:22.580
If you want to--

00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:24.260
let's turn the table
upside down here.

00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:26.040
Let's cause some disruption.

00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:26.540
Right?

00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:28.380
And it doesn't always have
to be in a rah-rah way.

00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:29.380
That's kind of my take.

00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:31.463
And my really good friend
out here in the audience

00:49:31.463 --> 00:49:32.960
is always trying
to calm me down.

00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:36.140
But there is ways
to do it in a more,

00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:38.870
you know, say a
lot without saying

00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:40.171
nothing type of way almost.

00:49:40.171 --> 00:49:40.670
You know?

00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:43.880
So what do you gents
think about that?

00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:49.880
ANTONIO PELAYO: Personally,
like, my work is not loud.

00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:53.000
So I'm not sure.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.300
But I'm with Margaret.

00:49:55.300 --> 00:50:01.162
I like to focus on
doing positive things.

00:50:01.162 --> 00:50:02.870
If there was a piece
that I would create,

00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:06.770
it would be for that,
to contribute, to help.

00:50:09.770 --> 00:50:12.470
How to become a better
organizer-- because that's

00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:13.790
what I do also on the side.

00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:16.940
I organize events
that raise funds

00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:20.330
for great organizations
like Plaza de la Raza

00:50:20.330 --> 00:50:23.930
and how that has an
impact on the community

00:50:23.930 --> 00:50:26.090
and the kids involved
in there, especially

00:50:26.090 --> 00:50:27.862
because they're
involved in the arts.

00:50:27.862 --> 00:50:30.320
MARCUS GRIMALDO: And Plaza de
la Raza, that's in Echo Park.

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:31.040
Right?

00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:31.530
ANTONIO PELAYO: Lincoln Park.

00:50:31.530 --> 00:50:32.270
MARCUS GRIMALDO:
Or Lincoln Park.

00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:33.050
OK, sorry.

00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:33.821
I got it.

00:50:33.821 --> 00:50:34.320
Thank you.

00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:35.390
ANTONIO PELAYO:
Maria's the director.

00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:36.470
MARGARET GARCIA: Yes.

00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:37.619
I know I talk a lot.

00:50:37.619 --> 00:50:38.910
MARCUS GRIMALDO: No, that's OK.

00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:39.080
Please.

00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:41.413
MARGARET GARCIA: But I want
to say something else that I

00:50:41.413 --> 00:50:45.200
find really, really important.

00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:49.700
We define our community
through our culture.

00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:51.590
And this is us.

00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:54.650
This is how we
define who we are.

00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:56.760
And we need to own it.

00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:59.630
And we need to own it very
strongly because somebody

00:50:59.630 --> 00:51:03.470
else is going to call you on
that and tell you who you are.

00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:07.100
Instead of you
defining who you are,

00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:10.040
you end up being in a position
where they're calling you

00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:13.160
rapists and murderers and things
like that because they feel

00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:16.440
they have the power to do that.

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:19.160
So you need to protect
that part of your culture.

00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:21.560
And you need to define
it through the arts

00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:25.640
by supporting the arts
within the community.

00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:27.100
And you do that with the artist.

00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:30.302
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:30.302 --> 00:51:34.662
MARCUS GRIMALDO: I'm
with her, hashtag.

00:51:34.662 --> 00:51:35.870
You don't get away so easily.

00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:36.940
We want to hear from you.

00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:39.590
MANUEL LOPEZ: No,
what they said.

00:51:39.590 --> 00:51:42.300
You know, I'm kind
of quiet as well.

00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:46.190
But right now, I'm working
with Plaza de la Raza.

00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:48.620
And I think just
working with young kids

00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:51.650
and showing them the
little that I know.

00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:54.980
And also, like I think learning
from them, that interaction

00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:56.990
going back and forth.

00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:59.000
I also teach at
[INAUDIBLE],, which

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.650
is an indigenous-based
school in El Sereno.

00:52:02.650 --> 00:52:05.690
And I mean, I
designed their logo.

00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:09.680
And we carry it for
every procession we make.

00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:12.080
I mean, the last one, the
major one, major one we had

00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:15.470
was at City Hall to try to--

00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:18.200
well, actually, we succeeded
in changing Columbus Day

00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:19.981
to Indigenous Peoples Day.

00:52:19.981 --> 00:52:20.480
And just--

00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:23.330
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:23.330 --> 00:52:27.724
And so, you know, it's
like Margaret said.

00:52:27.724 --> 00:52:29.390
You know, it's about
knowing your roots.

00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:31.100
Because we all have roots.

00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:32.890
And you got to be--

00:52:32.890 --> 00:52:36.050
you've got to be well
planted in order for you

00:52:36.050 --> 00:52:37.890
to know who you
really are, you know,

00:52:37.890 --> 00:52:40.010
and where you're
coming from, and also,

00:52:40.010 --> 00:52:42.420
where you're going to
eventually end up at.

00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:44.690
And even beyond that
is like the people

00:52:44.690 --> 00:52:47.210
that you're going to
bring into this world.

00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:49.130
You know, you just
want to have them

00:52:49.130 --> 00:52:51.746
know who they are and, like
l said, where they came from.

00:52:51.746 --> 00:52:53.120
So I think just
through that, you

00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:55.220
know, little things
that we do that are

00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:58.254
going to impact the world
hopefully for the better.

00:52:58.254 --> 00:52:59.420
MARCUS GRIMALDO: Absolutely.

00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:00.200
Absolutely.

00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:02.090
Well, I think on
that note, you know,

00:53:02.090 --> 00:53:03.830
this has been a phenomenal talk.

00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:06.290
And again, you know,
Margaret, Antonio, and Manuel,

00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:08.674
thank you so much
for coming and taking

00:53:08.674 --> 00:53:11.090
the time out of your day to
share these important insights

00:53:11.090 --> 00:53:11.420
with us.

00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:12.628
Because again, you are right.

00:53:12.628 --> 00:53:14.240
We are being defined--

00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:16.670
we define our cultures by art.

00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:18.710
And this is something
that we don't probably

00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:20.570
pay enough attention to in life.

00:53:20.570 --> 00:53:21.680
But we should.

00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:23.690
And you've done a great
job at illustrating

00:53:23.690 --> 00:53:25.040
that in our Boardwalk Cafe.

00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:26.750
So if any of you
haven't had time

00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:30.140
to spend time
looking at their art,

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:33.050
I think this is a nice
segue to not only spend

00:53:33.050 --> 00:53:36.710
time, but understand who
the person is, the artist is

00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:40.040
behind that artistic expression
that they have so graciously

00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:44.390
and kindly delivered here for
us in the spirit of Hispanic

00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:45.824
Heritage Month.

00:53:45.824 --> 00:53:47.240
And so with that
said, I just want

00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:50.840
to send a special thanks to
Anna Santos, Hector Carmona,

00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:52.940
and Jeannette [INAUDIBLE]
for really helping

00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:56.390
me facilitate this talk.

00:53:56.390 --> 00:54:01.010
Our HOLA Global chapter, as
well as our HOLA LAX chapter,

00:54:01.010 --> 00:54:02.690
local here, thank
you all so much

00:54:02.690 --> 00:54:04.160
for supporting us and this.

00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:11.390
And then last but not least,
to Nilza Serrano and the Latino

00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:14.480
Heritage LA family because this
is a partnership that we've

00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:16.010
come to again, a
tradition that we

00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:18.860
want to continue with
other artists that

00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:21.020
are doing amazing
things, like yourselves.

00:54:21.020 --> 00:54:23.120
And so thank you
for the support here

00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:24.960
and for helping us with this.

00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:27.780
And then certainly again, to
you artists for coming here.

00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:29.480
I thank you so much
for these insights.

00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:30.710
They've been highly valuable.

00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:34.280
And before we conclude,
you touched upon something

00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:34.800
important.

00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:37.160
I'm a big believer
in social media.

00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:39.130
Again, we can't always
just have these talks.

00:54:39.130 --> 00:54:39.320
Right?

00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:40.880
But we do want to stay
in touch with you.

00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:42.254
We want to know
what's happening.

00:54:42.254 --> 00:54:46.550
We want to know what's
going on with you in 2020.

00:54:46.550 --> 00:54:50.670
Do we have, besides a website,
do we have any Twitter,

00:54:50.670 --> 00:54:53.660
Instagram, Facebook?

00:54:53.660 --> 00:54:55.580
Because this is recorded
actually, live too.

00:54:55.580 --> 00:54:57.590
So feel free to say it.

00:54:57.590 --> 00:54:59.960
Say it slowly so
we can get it down.

00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:00.800
But we want to know.

00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:02.200
We want to stay in touch.

00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:05.000
We want to follow.

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.550
MARGARET GARCIA: I
do a lot of Facebook.

00:55:07.550 --> 00:55:09.440
I'm not too much into tweeting.

00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:12.920
I do have an Instagram account
that I can give you the number

00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:14.257
to for the website.

00:55:14.257 --> 00:55:15.090
MARCUS GRIMALDO: OK.

00:55:15.090 --> 00:55:16.881
MARGARET GARCIA: But
that's because I can't

00:55:16.881 --> 00:55:19.314
remember all those numbers.

00:55:19.314 --> 00:55:21.230
They've got us to the
point you can't remember

00:55:21.230 --> 00:55:22.550
your social security number.

00:55:22.550 --> 00:55:24.299
And they're going to
change your password.

00:55:24.299 --> 00:55:25.430
It's really bad.

00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:32.090
So Facebook, Margaret
Garcia artist.

00:55:32.090 --> 00:55:35.140
MARCUS GRIMALDO: Margaret
Garcia artist, Facebook.

00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:36.622
SeÃ±or Pelayo.

00:55:36.622 --> 00:55:38.830
ANTONIO PELAYO: Website,
Facebook, Instagram, Antonio

00:55:38.830 --> 00:55:39.330
Pelayo.

00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:41.538
MARCUS GRIMALDO: All Antonio
Pelayo across the board.

00:55:41.538 --> 00:55:42.626
All right, Antonio Pelayo.

00:55:44.899 --> 00:55:45.940
MANUEL LOPEZ: What's my--

00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:47.315
MARCUS GRIMALDO:
Oh, wait, email.

00:55:47.315 --> 00:55:49.360
I think we only get an email.

00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:49.860
No phone.

00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:51.485
MANUEL LOPEZ: I'm
running on Instagram.

00:55:51.485 --> 00:55:52.050
But--

00:55:52.050 --> 00:55:56.030
MARCUS GRIMALDO: The girlfriend,
what's your social media?

00:55:56.030 --> 00:55:57.280
No, is there a website though?

00:55:57.280 --> 00:55:58.900
MANUEL LOPEZ: No, no website.

00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:00.066
MARCUS GRIMALDO: No website.

00:56:00.066 --> 00:56:00.760
Is it coming?

00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:02.468
MANUEL LOPEZ: No, not
in the near future.

00:56:02.468 --> 00:56:04.450
But I have the Instagram.

00:56:04.450 --> 00:56:05.050
It's my name.

00:56:05.050 --> 00:56:06.580
But it's all scrambled up.

00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:08.359
Like, it's the hardest--

00:56:08.359 --> 00:56:09.900
MARCUS GRIMALDO:
Yeah, I was looking.

00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:10.290
Thank you.

00:56:10.290 --> 00:56:11.560
I thought I was going crazy.

00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:13.210
I was like, I can't
find him anywhere.

00:56:13.210 --> 00:56:14.470
It all makes sense now.

00:56:14.470 --> 00:56:15.540
OK.

00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:17.964
MANUEL LOPEZ: If guys want
to follow, its meaunl_lpoez.

00:56:24.835 --> 00:56:25.880
Damn, I got it right.

00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:26.380
All right.

00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:28.630
MARCUS GRIMALDO: That sounds
like one of my passwords.

00:56:31.277 --> 00:56:32.860
I thought you didn't
have a cellphone.

00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:34.360
MANUEL LOPEZ: No,
it's an iPod, man.

00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:35.790
MARCUS GRIMALDO: Oh.

00:56:35.790 --> 00:56:38.887
MANUEL LOPEZ: It only
connects when I have Wi-Fi.

00:56:38.887 --> 00:56:40.470
MARCUS GRIMALDO:
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:41.710
let's give one last
round of applause.

00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:42.484
Thank you so much.

00:56:42.484 --> 00:56:43.400
This has been awesome.

00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:43.540
Gracia.

00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:44.290
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:56:44.290 --> 00:56:48.520
[APPLAUSE]
