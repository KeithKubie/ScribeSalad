00:00:00.137 --> 00:00:01.397
- [Voiceover] Let's
start becoming familiar

00:00:01.397 --> 00:00:02.941
with our parts of speech.

00:00:02.941 --> 00:00:05.602
And we're gonna start with
the two most fundamental ones.

00:00:05.602 --> 00:00:09.483
First, the noun, which you
will often see described

00:00:09.483 --> 00:00:14.483
as a person, a place or a thing.

00:00:16.452 --> 00:00:19.296
And we're also gonna talk about verbs.

00:00:19.296 --> 00:00:24.296
A verb is something that
is some type of action.

00:00:24.314 --> 00:00:26.021
And at first this might seem a little bit

00:00:26.021 --> 00:00:28.560
hard to understand,
what is this word noun,

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.023
this word verb?

00:00:30.023 --> 00:00:31.710
But as we take, do a bunch of examples,

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.038
this will hopefully it'll
make a little bit more sense.

00:00:34.038 --> 00:00:36.375
So let's first look at
this first sentence.

00:00:36.375 --> 00:00:38.020
Bill likes dessert.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.483
So I encourage you to pause the video,

00:00:39.483 --> 00:00:40.600
look at each of these words

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.369
and say is that a person, place or thing?

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:43.769
Or is it some type of action?

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:44.602
Or is it neither?

00:00:44.602 --> 00:00:47.407
And so it wouldn't be a noun or a verb.

00:00:47.407 --> 00:00:48.361
Let's do it together.

00:00:48.361 --> 00:00:51.211
So in Bill likes dessert,
Bill is a person.

00:00:51.211 --> 00:00:52.918
So it is a person, place or thing.

00:00:52.918 --> 00:00:56.148
So this, the word Bill is a noun.

00:00:56.148 --> 00:00:59.419
So that right over there,
Bill, that is a noun.

00:00:59.419 --> 00:01:02.325
And then Bill likes dessert.

00:01:02.325 --> 00:01:04.864
So likes is not a person, place or thing.

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:06.551
That would not be a noun.

00:01:06.551 --> 00:01:08.440
But dessert is a person, place or thing.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.208
In this case it is a thing.

00:01:10.208 --> 00:01:13.397
So dessert is also gonna be a noun.

00:01:13.397 --> 00:01:17.156
So we have two nouns, we have
two nouns in this sentence.

00:01:17.156 --> 00:01:18.659
Bill and dessert.

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.021
But what is likes?

00:01:20.021 --> 00:01:22.073
What's the action that Bill is taking?

00:01:22.073 --> 00:01:27.050
Bill likes dessert, so
likes is going to be a verb.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.960
Or likes is a verb.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.643
So that is a verb.

00:01:32.643 --> 00:01:33.951
Let's do another example.

00:01:33.951 --> 00:01:35.543
I slept.

00:01:35.543 --> 00:01:38.482
Once again pause the video,
see if you can figure out

00:01:38.482 --> 00:01:41.618
the noun and the verb.

00:01:41.618 --> 00:01:45.559
Alright so we start with I,
is I a person, place or thing?

00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:48.078
Yeah its a person, its whoever
is saying the sentence.

00:01:48.078 --> 00:01:49.832
In this case, I guess its me.

00:01:49.832 --> 00:01:52.479
So this would be a noun.

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.832
So let me do that in our noun color

00:01:55.832 --> 00:01:57.457
which is going to be yellow.

00:01:57.457 --> 00:02:00.911
So this is a noun, I.

00:02:00.911 --> 00:02:03.268
And then slept is not a
person, place or thing

00:02:03.268 --> 00:02:06.843
its an action, its what I did, I slept.

00:02:06.843 --> 00:02:11.843
So slept is a verb.

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:15.478
So we had one noun, one verb.

00:02:15.478 --> 00:02:16.376
Let's look at this next sentence.

00:02:16.376 --> 00:02:18.591
The pretty pig took a bath.

00:02:18.591 --> 00:02:20.298
Once again, pause the
video and see if you can

00:02:20.298 --> 00:02:22.614
identify the persons, places
or things or the nouns

00:02:22.614 --> 00:02:25.499
and see if you can identify any verbs.

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:28.587
So the pretty pig, and we're
gonna cover what the is

00:02:28.587 --> 00:02:31.289
but the by itself is not
a person, place or thing,

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:32.854
i just did, to kind of get a little ahead,

00:02:32.854 --> 00:02:33.870
its called an article

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.746
and we'll talk more
about that in the future.

00:02:35.746 --> 00:02:37.953
Pretty by itself is not
a person, place or thing

00:02:37.953 --> 00:02:41.001
and its also not an action,
so let's ignore that for now

00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:42.707
and we'll get back to that.

00:02:42.707 --> 00:02:45.897
But pig, that is a person, place or thing.

00:02:45.897 --> 00:02:50.468
So pig is a noun, pig is a noun.

00:02:50.468 --> 00:02:53.028
And then took, not a
person, place or thing.

00:02:53.028 --> 00:02:54.776
A, not a person, place or thing.

00:02:54.776 --> 00:02:57.661
Bath, well a bath, a bath is a thing.

00:02:57.661 --> 00:02:59.347
So that is also a noun.

00:02:59.347 --> 00:03:01.887
So those are the nouns right over there.

00:03:01.887 --> 00:03:05.747
So pig, pig and bath.

00:03:05.747 --> 00:03:07.453
Now what's our verb?

00:03:07.453 --> 00:03:09.140
There's one verb in this sentence.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.949
And its what the pig did,
the action the pig did,

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:15.072
the pig took, took
something, it took a bath.

00:03:15.072 --> 00:03:16.942
So that's our action right over there,

00:03:16.942 --> 00:03:18.181
that's our verb.

00:03:18.181 --> 00:03:21.513
Took is our, is our verb.

00:03:21.513 --> 00:03:22.711
I think we're getting the hang of this,

00:03:22.711 --> 00:03:23.727
lets keep going.

00:03:23.727 --> 00:03:27.080
The funny bird ran quickly.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.676
Once again, pause the video,
see if you can work it out.

00:03:30.676 --> 00:03:33.114
Well the by itself is not
a person, place or thing.

00:03:33.114 --> 00:03:34.881
Funny by itself it not
a person, place or thing

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:37.197
and neither of these are actions.

00:03:37.197 --> 00:03:38.762
Bird is a person, place or thing,

00:03:38.762 --> 00:03:39.859
its a thing.

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:44.207
So bird, bird is a noun.

00:03:44.207 --> 00:03:46.096
Bird is a noun.

00:03:46.096 --> 00:03:47.559
Ran, that's what the bird did,

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:50.708
that's the action, so
that's gonna be a verb.

00:03:50.708 --> 00:03:54.833
And quickly is neither an action nor is it

00:03:54.833 --> 00:03:57.372
a person, place or thing
and we'll study this part

00:03:57.372 --> 00:03:59.648
of speech in the future.

00:03:59.648 --> 00:04:00.704
Let's look at the next sentence.

00:04:00.704 --> 00:04:02.533
He ate the watch.

00:04:02.533 --> 00:04:04.845
Pause the video, see if you
can figure out the nouns

00:04:04.845 --> 00:04:06.962
and the verbs.

00:04:06.962 --> 00:04:11.488
So he, well that's a person,
so that's going to be

00:04:11.488 --> 00:04:14.308
that is going to be a noun.

00:04:14.308 --> 00:04:18.616
Ate, that's an action,
that is going to be a verb.

00:04:18.616 --> 00:04:20.708
The by itself isn't a
person, place or thing

00:04:20.708 --> 00:04:23.004
but watch is, watch is a thing,

00:04:23.004 --> 00:04:25.950
so that's gonna be our noun.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.423
One more sentence, Dogs are silly.

00:04:30.423 --> 00:04:34.964
Well dogs are clearly a
thing, so that's our noun.

00:04:34.964 --> 00:04:37.808
Now the verb might be a
little bit harder to see,

00:04:37.808 --> 00:04:39.739
what's the action?

00:04:39.739 --> 00:04:42.989
Well the dogs are silly,
you can say the action

00:04:42.989 --> 00:04:44.574
they are taking is being silly,

00:04:44.574 --> 00:04:46.382
and that's just something they do.

00:04:46.382 --> 00:04:48.678
So this one might be a little
bit harder to understand.

00:04:48.678 --> 00:04:50.872
But what is the dog doing,
they're being silly.

00:04:50.872 --> 00:04:54.895
Are is the action, so
that right over there,

00:04:54.895 --> 00:04:57.414
that right over there is the verb.

00:04:57.414 --> 00:05:01.112
So hopefully this starts to
give you a hang of things

00:05:01.112 --> 00:05:02.676
and we'll look at a lot more examples.

00:05:02.676 --> 00:05:05.460
That's really the key of
understanding nouns and verbs.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.512
And we'll also start to think
about what all these other

00:05:07.512 --> 00:05:10.661
words are that we haven't labeled yet.
