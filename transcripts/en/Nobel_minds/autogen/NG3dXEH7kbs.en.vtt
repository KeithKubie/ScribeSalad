strong immune response we need to

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970
strong immune response we need to
 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.670
strong immune response we need to
activate what we call the adaptive

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680
activate what we call the adaptive
 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.600

immune defense and the run Steinman
 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.550
immune defense and the run Steinman
discovered really what kicked on that

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560
discovered really what kicked on that
 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.500
discovered really what kicked on that
active immune response it's via

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510
active immune response it's via
 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.570
active immune response it's via
interactions with so called dendritic

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580
interactions with so called dendritic
 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.570
interactions with so called dendritic
cells so we have sort of two lines of

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580
cells so we have sort of two lines of
 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.280
cells so we have sort of two lines of
defense system when it comes to

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290

already present a presentation being a
 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.420
already present a presentation being a
very dangerous world certainly we have

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430
very dangerous world certainly we have
 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.700
very dangerous world certainly we have
two lines we have a first immediate line

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710
two lines we have a first immediate line
 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.910
two lines we have a first immediate line
that protects us and actually clears us

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920
that protects us and actually clears us
 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.770
that protects us and actually clears us
from most pathogens but sometimes

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780
from most pathogens but sometimes
 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.050
from most pathogens but sometimes
pathogens can invade our body and we

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060
pathogens can invade our body and we
 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.970
pathogens can invade our body and we
need to mobilize a stronger defense

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:50.980
need to mobilize a stronger defense
 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.790
need to mobilize a stronger defense
that's the second defense so this is a

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800
that's the second defense so this is a
 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.160
that's the second defense so this is a
really evolution at work i mean the the

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170
really evolution at work i mean the the
 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.320
really evolution at work i mean the the
bacteria's are trying to get the round

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330
bacteria's are trying to get the round
 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.630
bacteria's are trying to get the round
or in new system and immune system is

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640
or in new system and immune system is
 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.910
or in new system and immune system is
trying to work against them exactly that

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920
trying to work against them exactly that
 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.580
trying to work against them exactly that
is what it is and you mention the word

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590
is what it is and you mention the word
 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.270
is what it is and you mention the word
evolution it's amazing that we have kept

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280
evolution it's amazing that we have kept
 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.190
evolution it's amazing that we have kept
our a new system for more than 600

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200
our a new system for more than 600
 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.280
our a new system for more than 600
million years Hoffman discovered they

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290
million years Hoffman discovered they
 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.610
million years Hoffman discovered they
your system it flies amazingly the same

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620
your system it flies amazingly the same
 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.099
your system it flies amazingly the same
type of system operates in us in you and

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:20.109
type of system operates in us in you and
 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:24.000
type of system operates in us in you and
me yeah got it that is the same gene

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010
me yeah got it that is the same gene
 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.740
me yeah got it that is the same gene
actually that works in in fruit flies

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750
actually that works in in fruit flies
 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.360
actually that works in in fruit flies
and in US and yes it's a it's a it's a

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370
and in US and yes it's a it's a it's a
 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.660
and in US and yes it's a it's a it's a
very similar gene which indeed to us

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670
very similar gene which indeed to us
 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.399
very similar gene which indeed to us
means that something is important if

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:35.409
means that something is important if
 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:37.080
means that something is important if
something is conserved throughout

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090
something is conserved throughout
 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.970
something is conserved throughout
evolution it's probably very important

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980
evolution it's probably very important
 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.550
evolution it's probably very important
so it's easy to understand why they have

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560
so it's easy to understand why they have
 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.410
so it's easy to understand why they have
got the price i mean the immune system

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420
got the price i mean the immune system
 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.649
got the price i mean the immune system
is life supporting for all of us but

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:46.659
is life supporting for all of us but
 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:49.440
is life supporting for all of us but
sometimes it works the wrong way and

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450
sometimes it works the wrong way and
 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.690
sometimes it works the wrong way and
then it can cause it's a lot of the very

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700
then it can cause it's a lot of the very
 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.750
then it can cause it's a lot of the very
common diseases it does indeed and this

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760
common diseases it does indeed and this
 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.960
common diseases it does indeed and this
is a problem first of all in some humans

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970
is a problem first of all in some humans
 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.030
is a problem first of all in some humans
some individual stimulus system does not

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040
some individual stimulus system does not
 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.170
some individual stimulus system does not
work those get more infections than

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180
work those get more infections than
 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.000
work those get more infections than
other people but if the bob is a bubble

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010
other people but if the bob is a bubble
 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.759
other people but if the bob is a bubble
children yes that's the most extreme

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769
children yes that's the most extreme
 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.059
children yes that's the most extreme
part and then there are situations where

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069
part and then there are situations where
 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.240
part and then there are situations where
the immune system overreacts and what is

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250
the immune system overreacts and what is
 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.619
the immune system overreacts and what is
dangerous is when the new system starts

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629
dangerous is when the new system starts
 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.039
dangerous is when the new system starts
to react against our own tissues our own

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049
to react against our own tissues our own
 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.430
to react against our own tissues our own
body is like a friendly fire in wall

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440
body is like a friendly fire in wall
 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.860
body is like a friendly fire in wall
it's tall shooting your own cells yes

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870
it's tall shooting your own cells yes
 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.289
it's tall shooting your own cells yes
you could say so what happens done well

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299
you could say so what happens done well
 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:29.969
you could say so what happens done well
kill diseases are we talking about them

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:29.979
kill diseases are we talking about them
 

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:32.490
kill diseases are we talking about them
well the new systems primary role is to

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500
well the new systems primary role is to
 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.619
well the new systems primary role is to
protect us against infectious diseases

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:34.629
protect us against infectious diseases
 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:37.319
protect us against infectious diseases
but it can also protect us against some

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329
but it can also protect us against some
 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:41.520
but it can also protect us against some
forms of cancer and then when the immune

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530
forms of cancer and then when the immune
 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.969
forms of cancer and then when the immune
system is not working we may get various

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:44.979
system is not working we may get various
 

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:48.300
system is not working we may get various
types of inflammatory diseases we now

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310
types of inflammatory diseases we now
 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.119
types of inflammatory diseases we now
know that diseases such as type 1

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:51.129
know that diseases such as type 1
 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:53.490
know that diseases such as type 1
diabetes as inflammatory bowel diseases

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500
diabetes as inflammatory bowel diseases
 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.530
diabetes as inflammatory bowel diseases
rheumatoid arthritis as multiple

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540
rheumatoid arthritis as multiple
 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.119

sclerosis relates to inappropriate

00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129
sclerosis relates to inappropriate
 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:02.460
sclerosis relates to inappropriate
function of the immune system so you are

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470
function of the immune system so you are
 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.530
function of the immune system so you are
hoping that in the future we can get

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540
hoping that in the future we can get
 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.830
hoping that in the future we can get
some medicine or some form of cure that

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840
some medicine or some form of cure that
 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.159
some medicine or some form of cure that
will serve slow down our own immune

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:11.169
will serve slow down our own immune
 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:13.289
will serve slow down our own immune
system and don't attack us our own

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299
system and don't attack us our own
 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.749
system and don't attack us our own
system so to speak okay the beauty where

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:15.759
system so to speak okay the beauty where
 

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:17.789
system so to speak okay the beauty where
the discoveries made by this year's

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799
the discoveries made by this year's
 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.129
the discoveries made by this year's
lauritz is the fact that they have

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139
lauritz is the fact that they have
 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.310
lauritz is the fact that they have
discovered molecules and cells which can

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320
discovered molecules and cells which can
 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.820
discovered molecules and cells which can
be manipulated just with that purpose to

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830
be manipulated just with that purpose to
 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:27.840
be manipulated just with that purpose to
slow down

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850
slow down
 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.750
slow down
or when he did enhance immune responses

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760
or when he did enhance immune responses
 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.360
or when he did enhance immune responses
and there's another very important

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370
and there's another very important
 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.070
and there's another very important
aspect of this is that is of course

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080
aspect of this is that is of course
 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.370
aspect of this is that is of course
vaccines and there being a lot about the

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380
vaccines and there being a lot about the
 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.470
vaccines and there being a lot about the
discussion about vaccines but we also

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480
discussion about vaccines but we also
 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.300
discussion about vaccines but we also
have heard about the bird flu and what

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310
have heard about the bird flu and what
 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.940
have heard about the bird flu and what
was different dangers got what would

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950
was different dangers got what would
 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.670
was different dangers got what would
bearing do the discoveries have on this

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680
bearing do the discoveries have on this
 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.500

field well these discoveries first of
 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.850
field well these discoveries first of
all explain to us how vaccines work

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860
all explain to us how vaccines work
 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.920
all explain to us how vaccines work
that's tremendously important they open

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930
that's tremendously important they open
 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.900
that's tremendously important they open
up for the generation of new types of

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910
up for the generation of new types of
 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.020
up for the generation of new types of
vaccines hopefully better vaccines so

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030
vaccines hopefully better vaccines so
 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.300
vaccines hopefully better vaccines so
they have a very close bearing to

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310
they have a very close bearing to
 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.540
they have a very close bearing to
vaccine generation could you develop

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550
vaccine generation could you develop
 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.580
vaccine generation could you develop
that better I've scenes involves about

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590
that better I've scenes involves about
 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.980
that better I've scenes involves about
dance pets better vaccines could be

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990
dance pets better vaccines could be
 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.590
dance pets better vaccines could be
vaccines that are stronger problem with

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600
vaccines that are stronger problem with
 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.450
vaccines that are stronger problem with
some of the vaccines today is that they

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460
some of the vaccines today is that they
 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.640
some of the vaccines today is that they
elicit responses but too weak responses

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650
elicit responses but too weak responses
 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.900
elicit responses but too weak responses
we now have tools to make vaccines

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910
we now have tools to make vaccines
 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.670
we now have tools to make vaccines
eliciting stronger responses so that

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680
eliciting stronger responses so that
 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.560
eliciting stronger responses so that
more people who get vaccinated get

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570
more people who get vaccinated get
 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.000
more people who get vaccinated get
protected from the disease's we

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010
protected from the disease's we
 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.640
protected from the disease's we
vaccinate against there is a debate in

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650
vaccinate against there is a debate in
 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.530
vaccinate against there is a debate in
the Western world at least about the

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:37.540
the Western world at least about the
 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.750
the Western world at least about the
benefits of accidents I mean a lot of

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760
benefits of accidents I mean a lot of
 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.820

people are scared these days to get

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830
people are scared these days to get
 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.280
people are scared these days to get
their children vaccinated and so on what

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.290
their children vaccinated and so on what
 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:45.900
their children vaccinated and so on what
do you have for missing what you have

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:45.910
do you have for missing what you have
 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.780
do you have for missing what you have
them what a message do you have for them

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:47.790
them what a message do you have for them
 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.260
them what a message do you have for them
well it's very sad in a way strange

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270
well it's very sad in a way strange
 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.950
well it's very sad in a way strange
discussion that is going on and vaccines

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960
discussion that is going on and vaccines
 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.340
discussion that is going on and vaccines
only in the last centuries saved more

00:05:59.340 --> 00:05:59.350
only in the last centuries saved more
 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.720
only in the last centuries saved more
than 400 million lives that is more than

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:03.730
than 400 million lives that is more than
 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:08.310
than 400 million lives that is more than
10 x 10 times as many people as died in

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:08.320
10 x 10 times as many people as died in
 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.070
10 x 10 times as many people as died in
any war during the 20th century to me

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080
any war during the 20th century to me
 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.590
any war during the 20th century to me
this is striking information certainly

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:16.600
this is striking information certainly
 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.960
this is striking information certainly
vaccines have done so much good for

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:18.970
vaccines have done so much good for
 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.450
vaccines have done so much good for
Humanity so much better than it has done

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:21.460
Humanity so much better than it has done
 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.500
Humanity so much better than it has done
bad things what do you think personally

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:25.510
bad things what do you think personally
 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.400
bad things what do you think personally
is the most exciting thing about this

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:28.410
is the most exciting thing about this
 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.810
is the most exciting thing about this
those discoveries that got the prize

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:30.820
those discoveries that got the prize
 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.600
those discoveries that got the prize
today but they tell us how we can make

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:33.610
today but they tell us how we can make
 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.360
today but they tell us how we can make
vaccines better they provide tools for

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:36.370
vaccines better they provide tools for
 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.080
vaccines better they provide tools for
us to make new drugs to be able to

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.090
us to make new drugs to be able to
 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:41.460
us to make new drugs to be able to
modulate the immune response

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:41.470
modulate the immune response
 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.320
modulate the immune response
is in various disease settings where

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.330
is in various disease settings where
 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.670
is in various disease settings where
immune action is working or not working

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680
immune action is working or not working
 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.080
immune action is working or not working
another scare of course is the

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:49.090
another scare of course is the
 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.350
another scare of course is the
resistance to antibiotics will these

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:52.360
resistance to antibiotics will these
 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.720
resistance to antibiotics will these
discoveries help in any way to develop

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:54.730
discoveries help in any way to develop
 

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:59.040
discoveries help in any way to develop
more smarter antibiotics maybe not

00:06:59.040 --> 00:06:59.050
more smarter antibiotics maybe not
 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:01.020
more smarter antibiotics maybe not
directly but indirectly I think they

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:01.030
directly but indirectly I think they
 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.180
directly but indirectly I think they
will do its of course important for us

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:03.190
will do its of course important for us
 

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.150
will do its of course important for us
to understand how our immune system

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.160
to understand how our immune system
 

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.850
to understand how our immune system
works it has the present like the

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:08.860
works it has the present like the
 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.870
works it has the present like the
present discoveries perhaps have greater

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:11.880
present discoveries perhaps have greater
 

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.250
present discoveries perhaps have greater
impact for vaccine development than

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:14.260
impact for vaccine development than
 

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.040
impact for vaccine development than
antibiotics per se let's turn for a

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.050
antibiotics per se let's turn for a
 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:19.920
antibiotics per se let's turn for a
second for now the big disease that we

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:19.930
second for now the big disease that we
 

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:23.970
second for now the big disease that we
are all scared of the cancer what how do

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:23.980
are all scared of the cancer what how do
 

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.800
are all scared of the cancer what how do
this immune system work against or with

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:27.810
this immune system work against or with
 

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.690
this immune system work against or with
cancer well the immune system has the

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:30.700
cancer well the immune system has the
 

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.030
cancer well the immune system has the
capacity to recognize certain types of

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:33.040
capacity to recognize certain types of
 

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.909
capacity to recognize certain types of
cancer our hope is of course that we in

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:35.919
cancer our hope is of course that we in
 

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:38.100
cancer our hope is of course that we in
situations where patients have cancer

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:38.110
situations where patients have cancer
 

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:41.430
situations where patients have cancer
should be able to enhance to create new

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:41.440
should be able to enhance to create new
 

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.840
should be able to enhance to create new
drugs that would enhance the immune

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:42.850
drugs that would enhance the immune
 

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:45.540
drugs that would enhance the immune
response in such a way that the immune

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:45.550
response in such a way that the immune
 

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:48.810
response in such a way that the immune
cells would attack cancers but cancers

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:48.820
cells would attack cancers but cancers
 

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.520
cells would attack cancers but cancers
are difficult to handle because they

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:50.530
are difficult to handle because they
 

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:52.200
are difficult to handle because they
also have their own ways to evade the

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:52.210
also have their own ways to evade the
 

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:53.970
also have their own ways to evade the
immune recognition so it's really a

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:53.980
immune recognition so it's really a
 

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.940
immune recognition so it's really a
battle going on in our bodies cancer

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:56.950
battle going on in our bodies cancer
 

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:58.920
battle going on in our bodies cancer
changed all the time and the immune

00:07:58.920 --> 00:07:58.930
changed all the time and the immune
 

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:03.120
changed all the time and the immune
system is trying to develop to get to it

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:03.130
system is trying to develop to get to it
 

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:05.610
system is trying to develop to get to it
yeah exactly and this is the struggle we

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:05.620
yeah exactly and this is the struggle we
 

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.430
yeah exactly and this is the struggle we
have to work with this is a common

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:08.440
have to work with this is a common
 

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.320
have to work with this is a common
misunderstanding because people lay

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:10.330
misunderstanding because people lay
 

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:11.520
misunderstanding because people lay
people who are usually talk about

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:11.530
people who are usually talk about
 

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:13.860
people who are usually talk about
medicine and say hey we can go to the

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:13.870
medicine and say hey we can go to the
 

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:16.770
medicine and say hey we can go to the
moon but you can't cure cancer is how

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:16.780
moon but you can't cure cancer is how
 

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:19.110
moon but you can't cure cancer is how
difficult can it be it's certainly very

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:19.120
difficult can it be it's certainly very
 

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.290
difficult can it be it's certainly very
difficult relatively speaking it was

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:22.300
difficult relatively speaking it was
 

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.860
difficult relatively speaking it was
probably quite easy to go to the moon we

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:25.870
probably quite easy to go to the moon we
 

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.200
probably quite easy to go to the moon we
still don't know how to cure all cancers

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:28.210
still don't know how to cure all cancers
 

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:29.760
still don't know how to cure all cancers
but we have become better and we are

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:29.770
but we have become better and we are
 

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:31.200
but we have become better and we are
becoming better and better for every
