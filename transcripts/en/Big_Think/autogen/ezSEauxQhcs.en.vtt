science student so the fields of machine

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790

learning and robotics has making

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679

this point it seems almost inevitable

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369
this point it seems almost inevitable
 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.670

that virtually all jobs are going to be

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680
that virtually all jobs are going to be
 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.040
that virtually all jobs are going to be
automated in the future so my question

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050
automated in the future so my question
 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.670
automated in the future so my question
is this when and if machines replace our

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680
is this when and if machines replace our
 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.150
is this when and if machines replace our
jobs

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160
