00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:41.050
topic for today is and again we're gonna
I'm gonna introduce to you what is NDK

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060
I'm gonna introduce to you what is NDK
 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.230

and I'm sorry to disturb you we are we

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240
and I'm sorry to disturb you we are we
 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.209
and I'm sorry to disturb you we are we
can see keynote we don't see the the

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:46.219
can see keynote we don't see the the
 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:53.590
can see keynote we don't see the the
presentation itself you'll I think you

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600
presentation itself you'll I think you
 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.090
presentation itself you'll I think you
might have screen Ching at only keynote

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100
might have screen Ching at only keynote
 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.740
might have screen Ching at only keynote
you need to screen share your desktop in

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750
you need to screen share your desktop in
 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.160
you need to screen share your desktop in
order for the actual presentation to

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170
order for the actual presentation to
 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.319
order for the actual presentation to
sure okay I'm gonna do it another good

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329
sure okay I'm gonna do it another good
 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:11.880
sure okay I'm gonna do it another good
all right

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890
 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.160
so whilst Anya does that then DK is

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170
so whilst Anya does that then DK is
 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.790
so whilst Anya does that then DK is
obviously an alternative to using

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800
obviously an alternative to using
 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.150
obviously an alternative to using
eclipse in doing Java programming and

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160
eclipse in doing Java programming and
 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.320
eclipse in doing Java programming and
well I don't want to steal any thunder

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330
well I don't want to steal any thunder
 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.600
well I don't want to steal any thunder
so go ahead on your it

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610
so go ahead on your it
 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.050
so go ahead on your it
alright so everything's fine now yeah

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060
alright so everything's fine now yeah
 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.059
alright so everything's fine now yeah
all right thanks

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069
all right thanks
 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.920
all right thanks
so first what is indicates the native

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930
so first what is indicates the native
 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.140
so first what is indicates the native
development kit which basically means it

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150
development kit which basically means it
 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.210
development kit which basically means it
allows you to write native build and

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220
allows you to write native build and
 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.180
allows you to write native build and
publish native applications build and

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190
publish native applications build and
 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.809
publish native applications build and
deploy which I should say since add it's

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819
deploy which I should say since add it's
 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:48.670
deploy which I should say since add it's
actually a tool set collection of tools

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680
actually a tool set collection of tools
 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.590
actually a tool set collection of tools
which includes cross to change like the

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600
which includes cross to change like the
 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.330
which includes cross to change like the
compiler linker and build system for

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340
compiler linker and build system for
 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.360
compiler linker and build system for
native libraries which you use to write

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370
native libraries which you use to write
 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.059
native libraries which you use to write
your C C++ code putting them against the

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069
your C C++ code putting them against the
 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:59.740
your C C++ code putting them against the
libraries available as part of the

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750
libraries available as part of the
 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.039
libraries available as part of the
system ABI with finally interface as

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049
system ABI with finally interface as
 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.039
system ABI with finally interface as
well as your libraries and include them

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049
well as your libraries and include them
 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:07.960
well as your libraries and include them
as part of the Android build system so

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970
as part of the Android build system so
 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.570
as part of the Android build system so
that they get packaged into your apks

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580
that they get packaged into your apks
 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.180
that they get packaged into your apks
and we also have a build system which

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190
and we also have a build system which
 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.640
and we also have a build system which
uses android dot m'kay the Android make

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650
uses android dot m'kay the Android make
 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.949
uses android dot m'kay the Android make
files and this is what you use to build

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959
files and this is what you use to build
 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.930
files and this is what you use to build
your native libraries then like I

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940
your native libraries then like I
 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.310
your native libraries then like I
mentioned there are packaging tools

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320
mentioned there are packaging tools
 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.319
mentioned there are packaging tools
available so that when you actually add

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329
available so that when you actually add
 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:30.190
available so that when you actually add
a native library to your project which

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200
a native library to your project which
 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.990
a native library to your project which
also contains Java code and Android

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000
also contains Java code and Android
 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.809
also contains Java code and Android
manifest and other activities it allows

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819
manifest and other activities it allows
 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:36.670
manifest and other activities it allows
you to bundle your native libraries

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680
you to bundle your native libraries
 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.699
you to bundle your native libraries
along with your apk so that you can

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709
along with your apk so that you can
 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.930
along with your apk so that you can
deploy them to the Play Store and the

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940
deploy them to the Play Store and the
 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.729
deploy them to the Play Store and the
the part that I mentioned about ABI

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739
the part that I mentioned about ABI
 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:47.620
the part that I mentioned about ABI
which is the binary interface or the

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630
which is the binary interface or the
 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.569
which is the binary interface or the
headers these are basically the headers

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579
headers these are basically the headers
 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.390
headers these are basically the headers
available from the CC splash those

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400
available from the CC splash those
 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.920
available from the CC splash those
headers and average is available from

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930
headers and average is available from
 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.440
headers and average is available from
the android framework to you to code

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450
the android framework to you to code
 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.650
the android framework to you to code
against and there are a lot of things

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660
against and there are a lot of things
 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.030
against and there are a lot of things
about these libraries that you should

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040
about these libraries that you should
 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.069
about these libraries that you should
know and we're gonna look at some the

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079
know and we're gonna look at some the
 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:05.080
know and we're gonna look at some the
basic architecture of how all these

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090
basic architecture of how all these
 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.789
basic architecture of how all these
components are deployed so you better

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799
components are deployed so you better
 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:08.740
components are deployed so you better
understand what these libraries are and

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750
understand what these libraries are and
 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.900
understand what these libraries are and
why these are the only libraries you

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910
why these are the only libraries you
 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.789
why these are the only libraries you
should use so before we begin looking

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799
should use so before we begin looking
 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.099
should use so before we begin looking
into the libraries and architecture I

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109
into the libraries and architecture I
 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.199
into the libraries and architecture I
want to cover what NDK is not and this

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209
want to cover what NDK is not and this
 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.260
want to cover what NDK is not and this
is very important there are some people

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270
is very important there are some people
 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.480
is very important there are some people
the bosses question says ndk replacement

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490
the bosses question says ndk replacement
 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.999
the bosses question says ndk replacement
for SDK or can I can I just write my

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:28.009
for SDK or can I can I just write my
 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:30.460
for SDK or can I can I just write my
code in C C++ because I'm better at it

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470
code in C C++ because I'm better at it
 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.320
code in C C++ because I'm better at it
so NDK is not a replacement for SDK SDK

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330
so NDK is not a replacement for SDK SDK
 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.779
so NDK is not a replacement for SDK SDK
is always and will be the primary choice

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:37.789
is always and will be the primary choice
 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:39.730
is always and will be the primary choice
of development platform for Android and

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740
of development platform for Android and
 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.409
of development platform for Android and
it offers you tons of liabilities

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419
it offers you tons of liabilities
 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.309
it offers you tons of liabilities
through the dalvik and this this the SDK

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:45.319
through the dalvik and this this the SDK
 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:47.409
through the dalvik and this this the SDK
is the primary platform for development

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419
is the primary platform for development
 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.629
is the primary platform for development
indicates only targeted for special

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639
indicates only targeted for special
 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:52.089
indicates only targeted for special
cases and we're going to discuss what

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:52.099
cases and we're going to discuss what
 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:55.629
cases and we're going to discuss what
those cases are indica is not the

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639
those cases are indica is not the
 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:57.640
those cases are indica is not the
solution for performance issues so if

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650
solution for performance issues so if
 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.460
solution for performance issues so if
you have performance issues in your app

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470
you have performance issues in your app
 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.559
you have performance issues in your app
do not think that if I use C C++ code

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:02.569
do not think that if I use C C++ code
 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:04.749
do not think that if I use C C++ code
with NDK my app is going to be faster

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:04.759
with NDK my app is going to be faster
 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:07.480
with NDK my app is going to be faster
for most applications NDK will not make

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490
for most applications NDK will not make
 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.279
for most applications NDK will not make
a difference and dalvik is actually very

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:09.289
a difference and dalvik is actually very
 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:11.559
a difference and dalvik is actually very
much very optimized and has and provides

00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:11.569
much very optimized and has and provides
 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:12.700
much very optimized and has and provides
you with all the memory card which

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710
you with all the memory card which
 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.680
you with all the memory card which
collection stuff which you will have to

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690
collection stuff which you will have to
 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.899
collection stuff which you will have to
do manually when writing native code so

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:16.909
do manually when writing native code so
 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:18.490
do manually when writing native code so
it's not always a solution for

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500
it's not always a solution for
 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.719
it's not always a solution for
performance issues it's not meant for

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:22.729
performance issues it's not meant for
 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:24.490
performance issues it's not meant for
typical applications so if you have a

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500
typical applications so if you have a
 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.330
typical applications so if you have a
regular UI ListView kind of application

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340
regular UI ListView kind of application
 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.709
regular UI ListView kind of application

which means like you cannot choose NDK

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080
which means like you cannot choose NDK
 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.450
which means like you cannot choose NDK

you choose NDK for specific needs of
 

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:54.189
you choose NDK for specific needs of
your project because all the code is

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:54.199
your project because all the code is
 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:56.529
your project because all the code is
written in C and C++ and with gen I do

wrapper so now when to use NDK so if you

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610
wrapper so now when to use NDK so if you
 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:02.980
wrapper so now when to use NDK so if you
have a lot of libraries that you've

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990
have a lot of libraries that you've
 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.890
have a lot of libraries that you've
written as part of your projects or open

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900

source libraries that you would like to

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039
source libraries that you would like to
 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:10.149
source libraries that you would like to
use we use these native libraries you

00:06:10.149 --> 00:06:10.159
use we use these native libraries you
 

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:12.399
use we use these native libraries you
should use NDK so while you can still

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:12.409
should use NDK so while you can still
 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:14.529
should use NDK so while you can still
write your application code in Java you

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:14.539
write your application code in Java you
 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:16.300
write your application code in Java you
can actually include these libraries and

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.310
can actually include these libraries and
 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.580
can actually include these libraries and
make those j'ni calls across from darwin

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590
make those j'ni calls across from darwin
 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.420
make those j'ni calls across from darwin
to the native to the native world and in

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430
to the native to the native world and in
 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.040
to the native to the native world and in
that sense use these libraries that you

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050
that sense use these libraries that you
 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.529
that sense use these libraries that you
already have also if you're writing

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:26.539
already have also if you're writing
 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:27.969
already have also if you're writing
something that is computationally

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:27.979
something that is computationally
 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:30.879
something that is computationally
intensive for example a lot of math is

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:30.889
intensive for example a lot of math is
 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:34.029
intensive for example a lot of math is
involved you should use you can look at

00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:34.039
involved you should use you can look at
 

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:36.820
involved you should use you can look at
the option of using NDK because with NDK

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830
the option of using NDK because with NDK
 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:37.239
the option of using NDK because with NDK
you can

00:06:37.239 --> 00:06:37.249
you can
 

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:38.859
you can
leverage some of the CPU specific

00:06:38.859 --> 00:06:38.869
leverage some of the CPU specific
 

00:06:38.869 --> 00:06:41.079
leverage some of the CPU specific
extensions for performance like the

00:06:41.079 --> 00:06:41.089
extensions for performance like the
 

00:06:41.089 --> 00:06:42.759
extensions for performance like the
vector floating-point instructions and

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:42.769
vector floating-point instructions and
 

00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:45.669
vector floating-point instructions and
jnanam instructions and these these

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:45.679
jnanam instructions and these these
 

00:06:45.679 --> 00:06:47.139
jnanam instructions and these these
these are really fast routines that you

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:47.149
these are really fast routines that you
 

00:06:47.149 --> 00:06:49.629
these are really fast routines that you
can access directly from NDK so this may

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:49.639
can access directly from NDK so this may
 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:51.579
can access directly from NDK so this may
be a case where you can look to use

00:06:51.579 --> 00:06:51.589
be a case where you can look to use
 

00:06:51.589 --> 00:06:54.789
be a case where you can look to use
indicate if if you feel that's that last

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:54.799
indicate if if you feel that's that last
 

00:06:54.799 --> 00:06:56.109
indicate if if you feel that's that last
bit of performance you need to squeeze

00:06:56.109 --> 00:06:56.119
bit of performance you need to squeeze
 

00:06:56.119 --> 00:07:04.149
bit of performance you need to squeeze
out from from the platform so we're

00:07:04.149 --> 00:07:04.159
out from from the platform so we're
 

00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:05.439
out from from the platform so we're
gonna look at some of the supported

00:07:05.439 --> 00:07:05.449
gonna look at some of the supported
 

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:07.149
gonna look at some of the supported
platforms right now so we support the

00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:07.159
platforms right now so we support the
 

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:10.089
platforms right now so we support the
our v5 instruction set I'll be seven

00:07:10.089 --> 00:07:10.099
our v5 instruction set I'll be seven
 

00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:11.709
our v5 instruction set I'll be seven
with the hardware floating-point unit

00:07:11.709 --> 00:07:11.719
with the hardware floating-point unit
 

00:07:11.719 --> 00:07:13.899
with the hardware floating-point unit
come to in your instructions then we

00:07:13.899 --> 00:07:13.909
come to in your instructions then we
 

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:16.799
come to in your instructions then we
also support x86 architecture and MIPS

00:07:16.799 --> 00:07:16.809
also support x86 architecture and MIPS
 

00:07:16.809 --> 00:07:19.779
also support x86 architecture and MIPS
so what this means is basically you can

00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:19.789
so what this means is basically you can
 

00:07:19.789 --> 00:07:23.109
so what this means is basically you can
use MDK to build libraries for shared

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:23.119
use MDK to build libraries for shared
 

00:07:23.119 --> 00:07:25.449
use MDK to build libraries for shared
objects for these platforms only so your

00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:25.459
objects for these platforms only so your
 

00:07:25.459 --> 00:07:26.979
objects for these platforms only so your
code has to run on one of these

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:26.989
code has to run on one of these
 

00:07:26.989 --> 00:07:28.779
code has to run on one of these
platforms because the file is generated

00:07:28.779 --> 00:07:28.789
platforms because the file is generated
 

00:07:28.789 --> 00:07:30.579
platforms because the file is generated
and kept in a folder and all these

00:07:30.579 --> 00:07:30.589
and kept in a folder and all these
 

00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:33.759
and kept in a folder and all these
specific platforms are used are

00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:33.769
specific platforms are used are
 

00:07:33.769 --> 00:07:35.439
specific platforms are used are
available to you right now to generate

00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:35.449
available to you right now to generate
 

00:07:35.449 --> 00:07:40.299

those five babies so let's let's look

00:07:40.299 --> 00:07:40.309
those five babies so let's let's look
 

00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:42.519
those five babies so let's let's look
and look at an architectural overview of

00:07:42.519 --> 00:07:42.529
and look at an architectural overview of
 

00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:44.619
and look at an architectural overview of
where what NDK and what will the

00:07:44.619 --> 00:07:44.629
where what NDK and what will the
 

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:46.409
where what NDK and what will the
different components sit in the system

00:07:46.409 --> 00:07:46.419
different components sit in the system
 

00:07:46.419 --> 00:07:48.879
different components sit in the system
so if you're a Java developer or you've

00:07:48.879 --> 00:07:48.889
so if you're a Java developer or you've
 

00:07:48.889 --> 00:07:52.839
so if you're a Java developer or you've
you've actually used Java SDK before you

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:52.849
you've actually used Java SDK before you
 

00:07:52.849 --> 00:07:54.399
you've actually used Java SDK before you
can see there is a Linux kernel there

00:07:54.399 --> 00:07:54.409
can see there is a Linux kernel there
 

00:07:54.409 --> 00:07:57.939
can see there is a Linux kernel there
and then we have a runtime the talvik vm

00:07:57.939 --> 00:07:57.949
and then we have a runtime the talvik vm
 

00:07:57.949 --> 00:07:59.769
and then we have a runtime the talvik vm
and then you have all these framework

00:07:59.769 --> 00:07:59.779
and then you have all these framework
 

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:01.719
and then you have all these framework
classes and ap eyes and stuff available

00:08:01.719 --> 00:08:01.729
classes and ap eyes and stuff available
 

00:08:01.729 --> 00:08:03.159
classes and ap eyes and stuff available
to you that's print on top of the

00:08:03.159 --> 00:08:03.169
to you that's print on top of the
 

00:08:03.169 --> 00:08:05.229
to you that's print on top of the
runtime and these are the activity

00:08:05.229 --> 00:08:05.239
runtime and these are the activity
 

00:08:05.239 --> 00:08:08.859
runtime and these are the activity
managers the Empire and android

00:08:08.859 --> 00:08:08.869
managers the Empire and android
 

00:08:08.869 --> 00:08:10.959
managers the Empire and android
framework that's available in the SDK

00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:10.969
framework that's available in the SDK
 

00:08:10.969 --> 00:08:12.999
framework that's available in the SDK
and then you write your applications on

00:08:12.999 --> 00:08:13.009
and then you write your applications on
 

00:08:13.009 --> 00:08:15.189
and then you write your applications on
top of this so the runtime is talking to

00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:15.199
top of this so the runtime is talking to
 

00:08:15.199 --> 00:08:19.029
top of this so the runtime is talking to
the curl using j'ni which is Java native

00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:19.039
the curl using j'ni which is Java native
 

00:08:19.039 --> 00:08:22.569
the curl using j'ni which is Java native
interface so you can call c c + + native

00:08:22.569 --> 00:08:22.579
interface so you can call c c + + native
 

00:08:22.579 --> 00:08:28.269
interface so you can call c c + + native
code from Java Runtime but so what

00:08:28.279 --> 00:08:30.429
code from Java Runtime but so what
happens is that - there are some system

00:08:30.429 --> 00:08:30.439
happens is that - there are some system
 

00:08:30.439 --> 00:08:32.290
happens is that - there are some system

mentioned about a certain set of headers

00:08:36.969 --> 00:08:36.979
mentioned about a certain set of headers
 

00:08:36.979 --> 00:08:39.100

and library is available to you as an
NDK programmer the reason why that is so

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:41.750
NDK programmer the reason why that is so
 

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:44.259
NDK programmer the reason why that is so
because what a lot of the system

00:08:44.259 --> 00:08:44.269

on top of the Kerner these are not very
stable and there's no reason for them to

over the word so what we try to do is

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:23.690
over the word so what we try to do is
 

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:26.139
over the word so what we try to do is
provide your stable ABI the application

00:09:26.139 --> 00:09:26.149
provide your stable ABI the application
 

00:09:26.149 --> 00:09:27.910
provide your stable ABI the application
binary interface and this is a set of

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:27.920
binary interface and this is a set of
 

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.040
binary interface and this is a set of
headers and libraries that are available

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:30.050
headers and libraries that are available
 

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:32.139
headers and libraries that are available
to you to code again so we make sure

00:09:32.139 --> 00:09:32.149
to you to code again so we make sure
 

00:09:32.149 --> 00:09:33.730
to you to code again so we make sure
that these are stable these remain the

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:33.740
that these are stable these remain the
 

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.639
that these are stable these remain the
same over different versions of NDK so

00:09:36.639 --> 00:09:36.649
same over different versions of NDK so
 

00:09:36.649 --> 00:09:38.980
same over different versions of NDK so
you can always rely on kind of its kind

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:38.990
you can always rely on kind of its kind

of guarantee that they will work across
and then the box that you see that says

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:43.550
and then the box that you see that says

stable api's and then again you can use

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:49.910
stable api's and then again you can use
 

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:52.180
stable api's and then again you can use
gri wrapper and your applications can

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:52.190
gri wrapper and your applications can
 

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:54.370
gri wrapper and your applications can
have java code that can directly talk to

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:54.380
have java code that can directly talk to
 

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.500
have java code that can directly talk to
these your libraries that are talking to

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:56.510
these your libraries that are talking to
 

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:59.530
these your libraries that are talking to
stable ABI is using j'ni so this is an

00:09:59.530 --> 00:09:59.540
stable ABI is using j'ni so this is an
 

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:01.780
stable ABI is using j'ni so this is an
alternative code execution environment

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:01.790
alternative code execution environment
 

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:06.780
alternative code execution environment
but that basically is what NDK provides

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:06.790
 

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:08.740
so some of the headers that are

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:08.750
so some of the headers that are
 

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:13.030
so some of the headers that are
available to you and um I guess this is

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:13.040
available to you and um I guess this is
 

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.470
available to you and um I guess this is
pretty much all the headers available to

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:14.480
pretty much all the headers available to
 

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.060
pretty much all the headers available to
you and this is what you should be using

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:16.070
you and this is what you should be using
 

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:18.759
you and this is what you should be using
so the first one is Lipsy I think I have

00:10:18.759 --> 00:10:18.769
so the first one is Lipsy I think I have
 

00:10:18.769 --> 00:10:20.170
so the first one is Lipsy I think I have
a mistake they're saying lip it's a lip

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:20.180
a mistake they're saying lip it's a lip
 

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:22.540
a mistake they're saying lip it's a lip
see the standard c library and there's a

dynamic linking library and then we have

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:31.880
dynamic linking library and then we have
 

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:35.050
dynamic linking library and then we have
graphics related libraries like OpenGL

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:35.060

well not so recently which interbred we
 

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:55.439
well not so recently which interbred we
added support for more libraries and

00:10:55.439 --> 00:10:55.449
added support for more libraries and
 

00:10:55.449 --> 00:10:58.139
added support for more libraries and
basically cater to the needs of Kym

00:10:58.139 --> 00:10:58.149

standard C++ libraries available T so

00:11:07.749 --> 00:11:07.759
standard C++ libraries available T so

standard C++ libraries available T so
these these are the only headers or

00:11:09.249 --> 00:11:09.259
these these are the only headers or
 

00:11:09.259 --> 00:11:11.199
these these are the only headers or
libraries you should use in your program

00:11:11.199 --> 00:11:11.209

available because they may not remain
 

00:11:17.389 --> 00:11:20.559
available because they may not remain
the same so it's very important to note

00:11:20.559 --> 00:11:20.569
the same so it's very important to note
 

00:11:20.569 --> 00:11:22.089
the same so it's very important to note
that if you want to support your

that if you want to support your
 

00:11:22.099 --> 00:11:24.009
that if you want to support your
application across versions just stick

00:11:24.009 --> 00:11:24.019
application across versions just stick
 

00:11:24.019 --> 00:11:31.419
application across versions just stick
to the set of libraries so oh how do you

00:11:31.419 --> 00:11:31.429
to the set of libraries so oh how do you
 

00:11:31.429 --> 00:11:34.719
to the set of libraries so oh how do you
write a simple app so in terms of

write a simple app so in terms of
project structure is pretty much the

00:11:36.009 --> 00:11:36.019
project structure is pretty much the
 

00:11:36.019 --> 00:11:38.019
project structure is pretty much the
same when you create a project and you

00:11:38.019 --> 00:11:38.029
same when you create a project and you
 

00:11:38.029 --> 00:11:40.659
same when you create a project and you
can do that by using either Android

00:11:40.659 --> 00:11:40.669

00:12:00.969 --> 00:12:00.979
library source files and these may
 

00:12:00.979 --> 00:12:03.249
library source files and these may
actually be another like under project

00:12:03.249 --> 00:12:03.259
actually be another like under project
 

00:12:03.259 --> 00:12:04.419
actually be another like under project
that you know that you have and you can

00:12:04.419 --> 00:12:04.429
that you know that you have and you can
 

00:12:04.429 --> 00:12:06.879
that you know that you have and you can
displace that all that C C++ gone inside

00:12:06.879 --> 00:12:06.889
displace that all that C C++ gone inside
 

00:12:06.889 --> 00:12:09.879
displace that all that C C++ gone inside
this GRI folder and then you write a

00:12:09.879 --> 00:12:09.889
this GRI folder and then you write a
 

00:12:09.889 --> 00:12:13.959
this GRI folder and then you write a
build file and write dot mk5 and the

00:12:13.959 --> 00:12:13.969
build file and write dot mk5 and the
 

00:12:13.969 --> 00:12:15.669
build file and write dot mk5 and the
syntax is pretty easy and it's very

00:12:15.669 --> 00:12:15.679
syntax is pretty easy and it's very
 

00:12:15.679 --> 00:12:18.429
syntax is pretty easy and it's very
flexible so this is what you need to do

00:12:18.429 --> 00:12:18.439
flexible so this is what you need to do
 

00:12:18.439 --> 00:12:20.109
flexible so this is what you need to do
to bring your NDK code to strike the

00:12:20.109 --> 00:12:20.119
to bring your NDK code to strike the
 

00:12:20.119 --> 00:12:22.869
to bring your NDK code to strike the
Android MK file in this while you

00:12:22.869 --> 00:12:22.879
Android MK file in this while you
 

00:12:22.879 --> 00:12:24.429
Android MK file in this while you
basically describe when are your source

00:12:24.429 --> 00:12:24.439
basically describe when are your source
 

00:12:24.439 --> 00:12:25.929
basically describe when are your source
files for the source files you need to

00:12:25.929 --> 00:12:25.939
files for the source files you need to
 

00:12:25.939 --> 00:12:27.489
files for the source files you need to
build what are the libraries these

00:12:27.489 --> 00:12:27.499
build what are the libraries these
 

00:12:27.499 --> 00:12:29.039
build what are the libraries these
source files should link the case and

00:12:29.039 --> 00:12:29.049
source files should link the case and
 

00:12:29.049 --> 00:12:33.789
source files should link the case and
the output of the library so and this is

00:12:33.789 --> 00:12:33.799
the output of the library so and this is
 

00:12:33.799 --> 00:12:35.799
the output of the library so and this is
per module so if in your project you're

00:12:35.799 --> 00:12:35.809
per module so if in your project you're
 

00:12:35.809 --> 00:12:38.849
per module so if in your project you're
going to have more than a couple of

00:12:38.849 --> 00:12:38.859
going to have more than a couple of
 

00:12:38.859 --> 00:12:41.799
going to have more than a couple of
modules or native libraries that we are

00:12:41.799 --> 00:12:41.809
modules or native libraries that we are
 

00:12:41.809 --> 00:12:44.199
modules or native libraries that we are
building you will have an Android dot MK

00:12:44.199 --> 00:12:44.209
building you will have an Android dot MK
 

00:12:44.209 --> 00:12:46.989
building you will have an Android dot MK
file for each of those and and then on

00:12:46.989 --> 00:12:46.999
file for each of those and and then on
 

00:12:46.999 --> 00:12:48.459
file for each of those and and then on
top of that you'll have an application

00:12:48.459 --> 00:12:48.469
top of that you'll have an application
 

00:12:48.469 --> 00:12:50.139
top of that you'll have an application
dot M K which is basically error

00:12:50.139 --> 00:12:50.149
dot M K which is basically error
 

00:12:50.149 --> 00:12:52.989
dot M K which is basically error
something that is going to delegate the

00:12:52.989 --> 00:12:52.999
something that is going to delegate the
 

00:12:52.999 --> 00:12:54.699
something that is going to delegate the
module building to each of these Android

00:12:54.699 --> 00:12:54.709
module building to each of these Android
 

00:12:54.709 --> 00:12:58.779
module building to each of these Android
MK files so use the Android the the

00:12:58.779 --> 00:12:58.789
MK files so use the Android the the
 

00:12:58.789 --> 00:13:00.549
MK files so use the Android the the
application at MK f I have to build all

00:13:00.549 --> 00:13:00.559
application at MK f I have to build all
 

00:13:00.559 --> 00:13:02.279
application at MK f I have to build all
of these Android and K files

00:13:02.279 --> 00:13:02.289
of these Android and K files
 

00:13:02.289 --> 00:13:04.629
of these Android and K files
optionally you can use Java edge or

00:13:04.629 --> 00:13:04.639
optionally you can use Java edge or
 

00:13:04.639 --> 00:13:05.439
optionally you can use Java edge or
eclipse

00:13:05.439 --> 00:13:05.449
eclipse
 

00:13:05.449 --> 00:13:08.439
eclipse
tools ID tools to generate C headers

00:13:08.439 --> 00:13:08.449
tools ID tools to generate C headers
 

00:13:08.449 --> 00:13:12.549
tools ID tools to generate C headers
from Java files so if you are and with

00:13:12.549 --> 00:13:12.559
from Java files so if you are and with
 

00:13:12.559 --> 00:13:14.019
from Java files so if you are and with
Gingerbread we introduced something for

00:13:14.019 --> 00:13:14.029
Gingerbread we introduced something for
 

00:13:14.029 --> 00:13:16.059
Gingerbread we introduced something for
native activity and we get over there

00:13:16.059 --> 00:13:16.069
native activity and we get over there
 

00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:17.649
native activity and we get over there
but before that if you are writing code

00:13:17.649 --> 00:13:17.659
but before that if you are writing code
 

00:13:17.659 --> 00:13:19.000
but before that if you are writing code
for older platform

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:19.010
for older platform
 

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:22.030
for older platform
what we want to do is in your Java in

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:22.040
what we want to do is in your Java in
 

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.610
what we want to do is in your Java in
your new Java classes you may have in

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:24.620
your new Java classes you may have in
 

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:27.790
your new Java classes you may have in
your Java code your application code you

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:27.800
your Java code your application code you
 

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.260
your Java code your application code you
may have some methods implemented there

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:29.270
may have some methods implemented there
 

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:31.390
may have some methods implemented there
and some is some methods are something

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:31.400
and some is some methods are something
 

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.160
and some is some methods are something
that you want we use the native platform

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:33.170
that you want we use the native platform
 

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:35.290
that you want we use the native platform
for so you're gonna prefix the keyword

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:35.300
for so you're gonna prefix the keyword
 

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:37.420
for so you're gonna prefix the keyword
native in front of those methods in Java

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:37.430
native in front of those methods in Java
 

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:40.390
native in front of those methods in Java
and then you can use Java edge to

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:40.400
and then you can use Java edge to
 

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.130
and then you can use Java edge to
generate the headers for these java

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:42.140
generate the headers for these java
 

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:43.990
generate the headers for these java
files which which which actually

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:44.000
files which which which actually
 

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.330
files which which which actually
generates a j'ni group code and which

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:46.340
generates a j'ni group code and which
 

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:49.090
generates a j'ni group code and which
you can use to do interrupted Queen Java

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:49.100
you can use to do interrupted Queen Java
 

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:53.380
you can use to do interrupted Queen Java
and the dalvik at the native world so

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:53.390
and the dalvik at the native world so
 

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:55.690
and the dalvik at the native world so
once you do this step then this is

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:55.700
once you do this step then this is
 

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:58.540
once you do this step then this is
optional depending on your use case you

00:13:58.540 --> 00:13:58.550
optional depending on your use case you
 

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:00.400
optional depending on your use case you
would run the NDK build script which is

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:00.410

Gingerbread we we introduced something

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:50.960
Gingerbread we we introduced something
 

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.620
Gingerbread we we introduced something
called native activity so that the

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:53.630
called native activity so that the
 

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:55.840
called native activity so that the
before Gingerbread you would always need

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:55.850
before Gingerbread you would always need
 

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:57.760
before Gingerbread you would always need
to have some java code in your

00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:57.770
to have some java code in your
 

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:00.340
to have some java code in your
application and some specific methods

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:00.350
application and some specific methods
 

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:02.230
application and some specific methods
implemented in native code so you would

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:02.240
implemented in native code so you would
 

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.030
implemented in native code so you would
like I said you would put the native

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:04.040
like I said you would put the native
 

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.710
like I said you would put the native
prefix in front of those methods so you

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:05.720
prefix in front of those methods so you
 

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.440
prefix in front of those methods so you
would say try with native and you know

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:08.450
would say try with native and you know
 

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:10.240
would say try with native and you know
do this something and faster on others

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:10.250
do this something and faster on others
 

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:12.490
do this something and faster on others
so with Gingerbread

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:12.500
so with Gingerbread
 

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:15.400
so with Gingerbread
you can actually write Java LS classes

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:15.410
you can actually write Java LS classes
 

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:17.860
you can actually write Java LS classes
and you can stay my ant activity is a

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:17.870
and you can stay my ant activity is a
 

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:19.510
and you can stay my ant activity is a
native activity so you don't have to

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:19.520
native activity so you don't have to
 

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.910
native activity so you don't have to
write any application for and this is

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:21.920
write any application for and this is
 

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.040
write any application for and this is
some sort of useful for game developers

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:24.050
some sort of useful for game developers
 

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:25.960
some sort of useful for game developers
and something so if you are a game

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:25.970
and something so if you are a game
 

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:27.750
and something so if you are a game
developer and you have your all your

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:27.760
developer and you have your all your
 

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.490
developer and you have your all your
input and your UI and everything in

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:30.500
input and your UI and everything in
 

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.650
input and your UI and everything in
native code you really know

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:32.660
native code you really know
 

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:35.710
native code you really know
mien and Java interface to it so what

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:35.720
mien and Java interface to it so what
 

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:43.119
mien and Java interface to it so what
you do is write a native activity so

00:15:43.119 --> 00:15:43.129
you do is write a native activity so
 

00:15:43.129 --> 00:15:45.040
you do is write a native activity so
like I mentioned it implements a

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:45.050
like I mentioned it implements a
 

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:48.369
like I mentioned it implements a
complete activity in native code so

00:15:48.369 --> 00:15:48.379
complete activity in native code so
 

00:15:48.379 --> 00:15:50.199
complete activity in native code so
we'll just look at the manifest of how

00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:50.209
we'll just look at the manifest of how
 

00:15:50.209 --> 00:15:53.050
we'll just look at the manifest of how
you declare a native activity so if you

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:53.060
you declare a native activity so if you
 

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:55.090
you declare a native activity so if you
see in this in this slide there is

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:55.100
see in this in this slide there is
 

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.610
see in this in this slide there is
activity by the name of Android app dot

00:15:57.610 --> 00:15:57.620
activity by the name of Android app dot
 

00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:59.530
activity by the name of Android app dot
native activity and this is the activity

00:15:59.530 --> 00:15:59.540
native activity and this is the activity
 

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:04.449
native activity and this is the activity
pack which has a element called metadata

00:16:04.449 --> 00:16:04.459
pack which has a element called metadata
 

00:16:04.459 --> 00:16:06.699
pack which has a element called metadata
which specifies the name of a library

00:16:06.699 --> 00:16:06.709
which specifies the name of a library
 

00:16:06.709 --> 00:16:08.079
which specifies the name of a library
and this is the native memory we are

00:16:08.079 --> 00:16:08.089
and this is the native memory we are
 

00:16:08.089 --> 00:16:10.269
and this is the native memory we are
going to be using and the value is the

00:16:10.269 --> 00:16:10.279
going to be using and the value is the
 

00:16:10.279 --> 00:16:12.610
going to be using and the value is the
activity name the native activity

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:12.620
activity name the native activity
 

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:15.040
activity name the native activity
available so this will actually make

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:15.050
available so this will actually make
 

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:17.019
available so this will actually make
sure that your activity this will tell

00:16:17.019 --> 00:16:17.029
sure that your activity this will tell
 

00:16:17.029 --> 00:16:19.240
sure that your activity this will tell
the the Android runtime that you have

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:19.250
the the Android runtime that you have
 

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:20.949
the the Android runtime that you have
activity that there is no Java cross for

00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:20.959
activity that there is no Java cross for
 

00:16:20.959 --> 00:16:23.889
activity that there is no Java cross for
this activity there is no the entire

00:16:23.889 --> 00:16:23.899
this activity there is no the entire
 

00:16:23.899 --> 00:16:26.499
this activity there is no the entire
activity is implemented natively and if

00:16:26.499 --> 00:16:26.509
activity is implemented natively and if
 

00:16:26.509 --> 00:16:29.860
activity is implemented natively and if
your application is completely Java Ness

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:29.870
your application is completely Java Ness
 

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:31.300
your application is completely Java Ness
you would see that in the application

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:31.310
you would see that in the application
 

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:33.610
you would see that in the application
path we have something called adroit or

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:33.620
path we have something called adroit or
 

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:35.650
path we have something called adroit or
hash code false which means that there

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:35.660
hash code false which means that there
 

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:38.650
hash code false which means that there
is no Java code and all the all the

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:38.660
is no Java code and all the all the
 

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:43.139
is no Java code and all the all the
components inside this apk are knitted

00:16:43.139 --> 00:16:43.149
components inside this apk are knitted
 

00:16:43.149 --> 00:16:46.540
components inside this apk are knitted
so the entry point for a native activity

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:46.550
so the entry point for a native activity
 

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:48.699
so the entry point for a native activity
if you're writing in native app activity

00:16:48.699 --> 00:16:48.709
if you're writing in native app activity
 

00:16:48.709 --> 00:16:50.350
if you're writing in native app activity
completely Java less the entry point is

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:50.360
completely Java less the entry point is
 

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.769
completely Java less the entry point is
Android main so in your CC dash first

00:16:53.769 --> 00:16:53.779
Android main so in your CC dash first
 

00:16:53.779 --> 00:16:55.870
Android main so in your CC dash first
for you should have this entry point and

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:55.880
for you should have this entry point and
 

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:59.350
for you should have this entry point and
this is where the this is where your

00:16:59.350 --> 00:16:59.360
this is where the this is where your
 

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.170
this is where the this is where your
where the runtime starts interacting

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:02.180
where the runtime starts interacting
 

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.990
where the runtime starts interacting
with your application or passing you

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:05.000
with your application or passing you
 

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.370
with your application or passing you
this state and this is kind of similar

00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:06.380
this state and this is kind of similar
 

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:09.850
this state and this is kind of similar
to the Android activity style this is

00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:09.860
to the Android activity style this is
 

00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:14.020
to the Android activity style this is
implemented as part of Android native

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:14.030
implemented as part of Android native
 

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:16.270
implemented as part of Android native
group library and this is something you

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:16.280
group library and this is something you
 

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:19.689
group library and this is something you
will have to link against when you are

00:17:19.689 --> 00:17:19.699
will have to link against when you are
 

00:17:19.699 --> 00:17:21.610
will have to link against when you are
building your native code so when I

00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:21.620
building your native code so when I
 

00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:23.799
building your native code so when I
mentioned Android entia files where you

00:17:23.799 --> 00:17:23.809
mentioned Android entia files where you
 

00:17:23.809 --> 00:17:25.149
mentioned Android entia files where you
define your dependencies in the

00:17:25.149 --> 00:17:25.159
define your dependencies in the
 

00:17:25.159 --> 00:17:26.740
define your dependencies in the
libraries you would have also have to

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:26.750
libraries you would have also have to
 

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:32.260
libraries you would have also have to
include this library there so ok before

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:32.270
include this library there so ok before
 

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:34.659
include this library there so ok before
we discuss tools and IDs there are some

00:17:34.659 --> 00:17:34.669
we discuss tools and IDs there are some
 

00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:36.070
we discuss tools and IDs there are some
important performance considerations

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:36.080
important performance considerations
 

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:41.409
important performance considerations
with the NDK so when you are actually if

00:17:41.409 --> 00:17:41.419
with the NDK so when you are actually if
 

00:17:41.419 --> 00:17:45.669
with the NDK so when you are actually if
the first thing is the threads that are

00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:45.679
the first thing is the threads that are
 

00:17:45.679 --> 00:17:46.600
the first thing is the threads that are
created in your app

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:46.610
created in your app
 

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:48.700
created in your app
gays are tied to the process so

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:48.710
gays are tied to the process so
 

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:51.789
gays are tied to the process so
sometimes your activity may stop or make

00:17:51.789 --> 00:17:51.799
sometimes your activity may stop or make
 

00:17:51.799 --> 00:17:54.610
sometimes your activity may stop or make
pause and but your thread and your

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:54.620
pause and but your thread and your
 

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.140
pause and but your thread and your
process is still alight that's actually

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:56.150
process is still alight that's actually
 

00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:57.549
process is still alight that's actually
hosting these activities that's your

00:17:57.549 --> 00:17:57.559
hosting these activities that's your
 

00:17:57.559 --> 00:18:01.890
hosting these activities that's your
application which sponsored dalvik VM so

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:01.900
application which sponsored dalvik VM so
 

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:04.840
application which sponsored dalvik VM so
this this process may still be alive

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:04.850
this this process may still be alive
 

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:06.460
this this process may still be alive
so because the process may be alive if

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:06.470
so because the process may be alive if
 

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:08.140
so because the process may be alive if
you're using threads in your NDK code

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:08.150
you're using threads in your NDK code
 

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:10.510
you're using threads in your NDK code
your threads will also continue running

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:10.520
your threads will also continue running
 

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:11.919
your threads will also continue running
so it's something important you should

00:18:11.919 --> 00:18:11.929
so it's something important you should
 

00:18:11.929 --> 00:18:13.330
so it's something important you should
know when you're writing your

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:13.340
know when you're writing your
 

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:14.919
know when you're writing your
application although although the

00:18:14.919 --> 00:18:14.929
application although although the
 

00:18:14.929 --> 00:18:17.470
application although although the
activity may be out of the screen or may

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:17.480
activity may be out of the screen or may
 

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.180
activity may be out of the screen or may
have been passed because something some

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:19.190
have been passed because something some
 

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:20.980
have been passed because something some
dialog popped up in front but your

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:20.990
dialog popped up in front but your
 

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:22.600
dialog popped up in front but your
threads will still be done in so at

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:22.610
threads will still be done in so at
 

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:23.919
threads will still be done in so at
times you want to choose which threads

00:18:23.919 --> 00:18:23.929
times you want to choose which threads
 

00:18:23.929 --> 00:18:26.110
times you want to choose which threads
you should stop at that point of time or

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:26.120
you should stop at that point of time or
 

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.810
you should stop at that point of time or
which threads you should keep running so

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:28.820
which threads you should keep running so
 

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:31.330
which threads you should keep running so
if you're doing some kind of sound maybe

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:31.340
if you're doing some kind of sound maybe
 

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:32.620
if you're doing some kind of sound maybe
something you want to stop there right

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:32.630
something you want to stop there right
 

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:36.460
something you want to stop there right
there because once your activities stop

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:36.470
there because once your activities stop
 

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:38.530
there because once your activities stop
your past if you don't want to hear any

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:38.540
your past if you don't want to hear any
 

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:40.240
your past if you don't want to hear any
sounds on your application but there are

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:40.250
sounds on your application but there are
 

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:41.590
sounds on your application but there are
other things that you may need to keep

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:41.600
other things that you may need to keep
 

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.330
other things that you may need to keep
running so that's an important

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:43.340
running so that's an important
 

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:46.240
running so that's an important
consideration in writing NDK code native

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:46.250
consideration in writing NDK code native
 

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:49.750
consideration in writing NDK code native
code the the other thing is because the

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:49.760
code the the other thing is because the
 

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.610
code the the other thing is because the
process is only brought alive once there

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:51.620
process is only brought alive once there
 

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:53.470
process is only brought alive once there
may be some static initializers in your

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:53.480
may be some static initializers in your
 

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:54.700
may be some static initializers in your
code and they will only get in each

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:54.710
code and they will only get in each
 

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:57.010
code and they will only get in each
slice once so the activity stops and

00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:57.020
slice once so the activity stops and
 

00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:00.340
slice once so the activity stops and
then again resumes these static

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:00.350
then again resumes these static
 

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:02.490
then again resumes these static
initializers will not be loaded again so

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:02.500
initializers will not be loaded again so
 

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:04.990
initializers will not be loaded again so
you may want to avoid these static

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:05.000
you may want to avoid these static
 

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.580
you may want to avoid these static
instances and take care of initializing

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:06.590
instances and take care of initializing
 

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:07.990
instances and take care of initializing
these variables yourself

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.000
these variables yourself
 

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.220
these variables yourself
so as an indicate developer and also

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:11.230
so as an indicate developer and also
 

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:13.090
so as an indicate developer and also
there are other performance

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:13.100
there are other performance
 

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.710
there are other performance
considerations and tools and stuff

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:14.720
considerations and tools and stuff
 

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:17.289
considerations and tools and stuff
available for you because it can get

00:19:17.289 --> 00:19:17.299
available for you because it can get
 

00:19:17.299 --> 00:19:19.260
available for you because it can get
tricky and it's not easy to manage

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:19.270
tricky and it's not easy to manage
 

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:21.430
tricky and it's not easy to manage
memory when you're writing the memory

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:21.440
memory when you're writing the memory
 

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.500

we have one question on there which

00:25:59.560 --> 00:25:59.570
we have one question on there which
 

00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:01.960
we have one question on there which
basically says how do I send search

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:01.970
basically says how do I send search
 

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:03.730
basically says how do I send search
terms to the Google Search app built

into Android I mean the answer to this

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:08.240
into Android I mean the answer to this
 

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:11.080
into Android I mean the answer to this
is typically what you do is you just

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:11.090
is typically what you do is you just
 

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:15.880
is typically what you do is you just
call a URL like doing normal Google

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:15.890
call a URL like doing normal Google
 

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:18.400
call a URL like doing normal Google
search and you will actually not go

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:18.410
search and you will actually not go
 

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:19.750
search and you will actually not go
through the Google Search app it'll

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:19.760
through the Google Search app it'll
 

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.050
through the Google Search app it'll
it'll basically fire up your browser and

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:22.060
it'll basically fire up your browser and
 

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:24.700
it'll basically fire up your browser and
you'll get search results through

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:24.710
you'll get search results through
 

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:26.380
you'll get search results through
through the web page that the mobile

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:26.390
through the web page that the mobile
 

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:29.500
through the web page that the mobile
site so I guess my follow-up question to

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:29.510
site so I guess my follow-up question to
 

00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:30.640
site so I guess my follow-up question to
this would be is there anything

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:30.650
this would be is there anything
 

00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:34.780
this would be is there anything
particular that you that you were after

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:34.790
particular that you that you were after
 

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:37.420
particular that you that you were after
in in that built in Google Search app

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:37.430
in in that built in Google Search app
 

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:40.150
in in that built in Google Search app
because in general that Google Search

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:40.160
because in general that Google Search
 

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:42.400
because in general that Google Search
app is basically all the businesses a

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:42.410
app is basically all the businesses a
 

00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:45.630
app is basically all the businesses a
user interface for doing searches on

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.430
user interface for doing searches on
generally being we've we added Google

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:48.440
generally being we've we added Google
 

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:51.730
generally being we've we added Google
now which actually handles some Google

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:51.740
now which actually handles some Google
 

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:53.140
now which actually handles some Google
searches there and presents some

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:53.150
searches there and presents some
 

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:56.530
searches there and presents some
slightly but if you do the same search

00:26:56.530 --> 00:26:56.540
slightly but if you do the same search
 

00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:58.510
slightly but if you do the same search
through your mobile browser you do get

00:26:58.510 --> 00:26:58.520
through your mobile browser you do get
 

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:01.330
through your mobile browser you do get
the same knowledge cards and you know

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:01.340
the same knowledge cards and you know
 

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:03.400
the same knowledge cards and you know
the usual results and that they're kind

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:03.410
the usual results and that they're kind
 

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:05.320
the usual results and that they're kind
of formatted to match your screen size

of formatted to match your screen size
 

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:07.570
of formatted to match your screen size
and it goes through the browser so the

00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:07.580
and it goes through the browser so the
 

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:09.280
and it goes through the browser so the
browser is there you don't go directly

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:09.290
browser is there you don't go directly
 

00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:11.800
browser is there you don't go directly
into the Google Search app so in terms

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:11.810
into the Google Search app so in terms
 

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:13.150
into the Google Search app so in terms
of your results it should be the same

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:13.160
of your results it should be the same
 

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:15.850
of your results it should be the same
but I'll be interested to know what else

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:15.860
