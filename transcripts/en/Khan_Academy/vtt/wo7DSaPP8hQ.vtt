00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.850
We're told that for the past
few months, Old Maple Farms

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.690
has grown about 1,000 more
apples than their chief rival

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.000
in the region, River Orchards.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.180
Due to cold weather this year,
the harvests at both farms

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.920
were down by about a third.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.050
However, both farms made up for
some of the shortfall by

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.980
purchasing equal quantities
of apples from farms in

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.540
neighboring states.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.950
What can you say about
the number of apples

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.130
available at each farm?

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.800
Does one farm have more than the
other, or do they have the

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.670
same amount?

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.200
How do I know?

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.410
So let's define some
variables here.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:57.220
Let's let M be equal to number
of apples at Maple Farms. And

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.310
then who's the other guy?

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:59.260
River Orchards.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.750
So let's let R be equal
to the number of

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:12.030
apples at River Orchards.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.690
So this first sentence, they
say-- let me do this in a

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.540
different color-- they say for
the past few years, Old Maple

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.560
Farms has grown about 1,000 more
apples than their chief

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.650
rival in the region,
River Orchards.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.500
So we could say, hey, Maple is
approximately Old River, or M

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.680
is approximately River
plus 1,000.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.190
Or since we don't know the exact
amount-- it says it's

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.940
about 1,000 more, so we don't
know it's exactly 1,000 more--

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.080
we can just say that in a normal
year, Old Maple Farms,

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.880
which we denote by M, has a
larger amount of apples than

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.170
River Orchard.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.750
So in a normal year, M is
greater than R, right?

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.620
It has about 1,000 more apples
than Old Maple Farms.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.660
Now, they say due to cold
weather this year-- so let's

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.570
talk about this year now-- the
harvests at both farms were

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:03.995
down about a third.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.620
So this isn't a normal year.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.660
Let's talk about what's going
to happen this year.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.700
In this year, each of these
characters are going to be

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.280
down by 1/3.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.710
Now if I go down by 1/3, that's
the same thing as being

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.510
2/3 of what I was before.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.380
Let me do an example.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.700
If I'm at x, and I take away
1/3x, I'm left with 2/3x.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.800
So going down by 1/3 is the same
thing as multiplying the

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.910
quantity by 2/3.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.760
So if we multiply each of these
quantities by 2/3, we

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.880
can still hold this inequality,
because we're

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.010
doing the same thing to both
sides of this inequality, and

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.340
we're multiplying by
a positive number.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.680
If we were multiplying by a
negative number, we would have

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.460
to swap the inequality.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.400
So we can multiply both
sides of this by 2/3.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.525
So 2/3 of M is still going to
be greater than 2/3 of R.

00:02:59.525 --> 00:03:02.620
And you could even draw that in
a number line if you like.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.280
Let's do this in
a number line.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.450
This all might be a little
intuitive for you, and if it

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.980
is, I apologize, but if it's
not, it never hurts.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.440
So that's 0 on our
number line.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.490
So in a normal year, M is
has 1,000 more than R.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.330
So in a normal year, M might
be over here and

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.310
maybe R is over here.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.950
I don't know, let's say
R is over there.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.050
Now, if we take 2/3 of M, that's
going to stick us some

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.340
place around, oh, I
don't know, 2/3

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.840
is right about there.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.250
So this is M-- let me write
this-- this is 2/3 M.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.910
And what's 2/3 of
R going to be?

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.250
Well, if you take 2/3 of this,
you get to right about there,

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.970
that is 2/3R.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:56.360
So you can see, 2/3R is still
less than 2/3M, or 2/3M is

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.220
greater than 2/3R.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.890
Now, they say both farms made
up for some of the shortfall

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.900
by purchasing equal quantities
of apples from farms in

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.200
neighboring states.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:21.579
So let's let a be equal
to the quantity

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.235
of apples both purchased.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.430
So they're telling
us that they both

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.870
purchased the same amount.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.840
So we could add a to both sides
of this equation and it

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.410
will not change the
inequality.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.670
As long as you add or subtract
the same value to both sides,

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.640
it will not change
the inequality.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.000
So if you add a to both sides,
you have a plus 2/3M is a

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.150
greater than 2/3R plus a.

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.980
This is the amount that Old
Maple Farms has after

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.080
purchasing the apples, and this
is the amount that River

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.380
Orchards has.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.440
So after everything is said
and done, Old Maple Farms

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.200
still has more apples, and
you can see that here.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.690
Maple Farms, a normal year, this
year they only had 2/3 of

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.180
the production, but then they
purchased a apples.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.510
So let's say a is about, let's
say that a is that many

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.040
apples, so they got back
to their normal amount.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.810
So let's say they got back
to their normal amount.

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.610
So that's how many apples
they purchased, so

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.590
he got back to M.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:29.360
Now, if R, if River Orchards
also purchased a apples, that

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.110
same distance, a, if you go
along here gets you to right

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.370
about over there.

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.960
So once again, this is-- let
me do it a little bit

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.010
different, because I don't like
it overlapping, so let me

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.740
do it like this.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.260
So let's say this guy, M-- I
keep forgetting their names--

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.900
Old Maple Farms purchases a
apples, gets them that far.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.360
So that's a apples.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.700
But River Orchards also
purchases a apples, so let's

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:56.700
add that same amount.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.700
I'm just going to copy and paste
it so it's the exact

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:59.950
same amount.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:07.450
So River Orchards also purchases
a, so it also

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.470
purchases that same amount.

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.980
So when all is said and done,
River Orchards is going to

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.390
have this many apples in the
year that they had less

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:17.800
production but they went
and purchased it.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.420
So this, right here, is--
this value right here

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:26.120
is 2/3R plus a.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.380
That's what River
Orchards has.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.830
And then Old Maple Farms has
this value right here, which

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.290
is 2/3M plus a.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:36.590
Everything said and done,
Old Maple Farms

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.660
still has more apples.
