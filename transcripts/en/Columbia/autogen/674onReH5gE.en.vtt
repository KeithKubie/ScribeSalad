able to do that automatically so you get

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530
able to do that automatically so you get
 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.630

you're touching on some of the core

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790
you're touching on some of the core
 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.039
you're touching on some of the core
problems of the planet right there the

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049
problems of the planet right there the
 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:55.690

problems of cities if we all move there

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700
problems of cities if we all move there
 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.400

are converging with the bigger problems

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410
are converging with the bigger problems
 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.400
are converging with the bigger problems
of the planet today the politics of this

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410
of the planet today the politics of this
 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.170
of the planet today the politics of this
is that the fossil fuel industry in the

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180
is that the fossil fuel industry in the
 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.259
is that the fossil fuel industry in the
u.s. is very big and very powerful it's

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269
u.s. is very big and very powerful it's
 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:07.990

been able to block any moves to tax the

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000
been able to block any moves to tax the
 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.060
been able to block any moves to tax the
use of fossil fuels so instead the

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070
use of fossil fuels so instead the
 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.960
use of fossil fuels so instead the
government has had to move to

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970
government has had to move to
 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.449
government has had to move to
subsidizing non-fossil fuels when you

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459
subsidizing non-fossil fuels when you
 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.160
subsidizing non-fossil fuels when you
see some of that in Europe obviously in

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170
see some of that in Europe obviously in
 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.780
see some of that in Europe obviously in
germany in spain and italy for the

germany in spain and italy for the
 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.569
germany in spain and italy for the
feed-in tariffs but that's basically the

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579
feed-in tariffs but that's basically the
 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.729
