With Flutter, removing
a widget completely is easy.

00:00:10.671 --> 00:00:12.901
You just rebuild without it!

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:16.033
But what if you need
that widget to disappear

00:00:16.033 --> 00:00:17.562
but still take up space?

00:00:17.562 --> 00:00:19.582
So the rest of your layout
stays where it is,

00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:20.993
the way iOS is hidden then,

00:00:20.993 --> 00:00:23.022
Android's invisible work.

00:00:23.022 --> 00:00:24.723
Try an <i>Opacity</i> widget!

00:00:24.723 --> 00:00:26.692
Just wrap your widget with <i>Opacity</i>,

00:00:26.692 --> 00:00:28.052
set the value to zero,

00:00:28.062 --> 00:00:29.403
and you're all set!

00:00:30.354 --> 00:00:34.321
You can also use <i>Opacity</i> for blending
one child of a stack onto another.

00:00:34.321 --> 00:00:36.631
And if you want to animate
a changing <i>Opacity</i>,

00:00:36.631 --> 00:00:38.803
there's an <i>AnimatedOpacity</i> widget too.

00:00:38.803 --> 00:00:40.842
Just give an <i>Opacity</i> and a duration,

00:00:40.842 --> 00:00:42.062
and when you rebuild,

00:00:42.062 --> 00:00:44.123
it animates the change automatically.

00:00:46.065 --> 00:00:49.051
