00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.770
I just got an cool little minion that’s
gung-ho to try some experiments, so what do

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.069
you think would happen, if we let him play
with high voltage electricity? In this project

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.119
we’re repurposing a Neon Sign Transformer
to power some mad science experiments, and

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.800
push the boundaries on cooking with electricity.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.439
Let’s start this experiment with a Neon
Sign Transformer. This one’s 12,000 volts,

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.119
and current limited to 30mA, which basically
means it’s less likely to kill you.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.290
These kind of NSTs are getting outdated and
thrown away all the time, so if you make friends

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.950
with a contractor in the electric sign industry,
you might be able to get a whole load of them

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.060
just for buying him lunch. Ask me how I know
that.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.790
Let’s connect a couple of alligator clips
to either side of the high voltage terminals,

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.940
then carefully connect the hot and neutral
leads to 120VAC. With the NST powered up,

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.260
you can actually feel the wires buzzing, and
if they get too close to each-other, the electricity

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.290
jumps from one lead to the other, forming
an electric bridge. This kind of electricity

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.290
is very aggressive, so make sure you don’t
get your hands too close to the leads themselves,

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.140
because you don’t want the electricity jumping
into you.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.060
Now for our first experiment, I stopped by
a local toy store and got a little helper.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.430
His name is Stuart, and we’ll start by strapping
10” nail spikes to his hands, secured in

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.320
place with black zip-ties. If we clip the
leads from the NST directly to the spikes

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.280
and turn on the power, our little minion gets
a fascinating look at electrified plasma,

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.520
up close and personal. Now you might have
noticed the tips of the nails glowing purple,

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.310
and the electricity seems to be really really
stretchy. That’s because once it jumps the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.820
gap, the electrons ionize the air making it
more conductive, essentially forming a conduit

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.020
that lets power flow without wires. This is
one of the reasons that high voltage is so

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.820
dangerous. Because it can literally jump right
through the air and bite you, if you get too close.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.340
Alright let’s try something a little safer.
I just built a Jacob’s ladder out of a 3/16”

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.659
steel rod, and a wooden base that I spray-painted
silver. The rods aren’t connected, but you

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.520
can see there’s a place for hooking a high
voltage lead to each individual rod. I bent

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.479
the wires so they they’re a quarter inch
apart at the bottom, then gradually spread

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.219
upward to 3-1/2” at the top. These magnetic
balls at the tips, are just to make it look cooler.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.899
If we clip a lead to each of the rods, we
can safely plug in our NST, and turn on the

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.099
power from a distance. Now check out what’s
going on between the rods. There’s enough

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.999
voltage for the electricity to jump the air
gap at the bottom, then the arcs immediately

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:20.370
rocket upward, climbing toward the top.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.870
This happens because when the electrons jump
the gap, they heat the air between the rods,

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.680
and as you know, hot air rises. The rising
air carries the electricity upward until it

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.719
gets stretched so wide it can’t hang on
anymore. So it gives up and goes back to jumping

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:36.909
the easier gap at the bottom. Which you can
see repeats over and over again indefinitely.

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:41.069
Alright, let’s try something a little bit
different. If we try holding the electrodes

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.019
horizontally, you can see the arc doesn’t
have anywhere to go, it just sits there peacefully.

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.200
But watch what happens if we blow on it with
a straw. The plasma quickly dissipates, and

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.230
you can see individual streams of electrons
jumping the gap, and a beautiful purple corona

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.430
spreading off to the sides. Which kind of looks like an electrical cotton candy.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.400
Now for one last experiment, what do you think
would happen if we tried skewering two marshmallows

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.510
with the two electrodes? Look closely at the
gap when we turn on the power, and you’ll

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.090
see purple sparks jumping around, heating
the marshmallows from the inside out. Which

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.230
apparently makes it bubble and morph like
something right out of a sci-fi movie. A few

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.690
seconds later you can see mini smoke rings
shooting all around the room.  

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.710
And just when we thought things couldn’t get any crazier the whole thing bursts into flames.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.829
Well I guess that’s just what you’d expect when you hire a minion to do mad science experiments.

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:30.459
Well now you know how to repurpose old NSTs,
to build a 12,000 volt Jacob’s ladder, or

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.549
just to try roasting marshmallows, with science.
Well that’s it for now. If you liked this

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:39.889
project, perhaps you’ll like some of my
others. Check them out at www.thekingofrandom.com
