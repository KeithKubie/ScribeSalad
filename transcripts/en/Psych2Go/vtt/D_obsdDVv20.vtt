00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.100
A little mystery always keeps things more interesting

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.700
That's why introverts are one of a kind

00:00:06.815 --> 00:00:10.175
With their unique insights, it's no surprise that many people fall for them

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.300
But how do we know if their feelings are mutual?

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.495
Here are 13 subtle signs an introvert likes you

00:00:18.025 --> 00:00:21.025
1. They actually pick up the phone or call you

00:00:21.125 --> 00:00:24.345
This is especially true for restrained introverts

00:00:24.345 --> 00:00:27.900
This type of introvert is reserved and slowly opens up to others

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.200
If this sounds like your crush

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.200
slow and steady wins their heart

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.400
Preferring to think before they speak, texts are more of their speed and they often avoid phone calls

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.400
But if they make an exception for you, that's incredibly special

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.200
2. They invite you into their personal space

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.100
Introverts like their space, especially after a long busy week

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.100
But if they make plans with you to go over to their place

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.115
whether it's for dinner or a movie

00:00:53.115 --> 00:00:57.000
it means that they prefer your company over their solitude

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.305
3. Or they accept your invitation and go out

00:01:00.735 --> 00:01:03.905
Meeting you faces and socializing can be intimidating

00:01:03.905 --> 00:01:06.100
especially for social introverts

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.300
They often enjoy the comfort of their own home

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.900
and don't go out of their way to attend parties

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.500
So pay close attention to just how willing they are to leave their comfort zone just to see you

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.100
4. They remember details about you

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.800
Speaking of close attention, introverts make natural detectives

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.620
Do they know you like the back of their hand when you've only mentioned things once?

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.400
If they remember your birthday, your favorite things, your favorite Kpop group

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.900
and notice all the small details about you

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.460
there's a good chance that they might have feelings for you

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.600
5. They don't shy away from personal topics.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.100
Thinking introverts have a knack for being deep in reflective

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.300
This makes it easy to be mesmerized by them in good conversation

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.800
When they talk about sensitive topics, whether it's about their tough childhood or losing a loved one

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.500
it's because they're also enjoying what you offer to the table

00:01:56.095 --> 00:01:58.700
6. They become more romantic overtime.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.465
With extroverts, the flame bursts the most at the very beginning, but introverts operate on their own clock

00:02:04.465 --> 00:02:08.400
When it comes to bonding, their affection for you grows stronger overtime.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.820
Introverts are slow at opening up

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.520
So the more your connection strengthens, the more affection it may become

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.020
You'll never have to worry about the excitement dying out

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.240
7. They keep your secrets and share theirs, too

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.220
Winning the trust of introverts is often as slow-downs

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.020
You must learn to sway before you tango

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.620
That's why it's so big when they've learned to keep your secrets, and tell you theirs.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.500
8. They always keep in touch with you

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.460
This can be hard for them, especially for anxious introverts

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.220
Self-conscious and painfully shy,

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.460
they often seek solitude but sometimes the anxiety doesn't go away

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.460
even when they are alone

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.960
If you catch one who makes an effort to stay in touch

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.160
it means that they feel comfortable around you, and that's a plus in their book

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.800
9. They show you their collections

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.340
It's nerve-wracking for introverts to tell them how you feel

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.480
So they may resort to their favorite poetry or music collections to do all the talking

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.720
Yes, it's cheesy but you have to admit it's also really cute

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.580
Bonus point is they show you something that is  sentimental or personal

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.380
like a journal entry or a secret art piece, too

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.240
10. They're loyal to you.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.440
Introverts make great partners because once they like you, they'll become protective

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.340
Although they don't like conflict, they won't shy away from it if it means that they're looking after you

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.840
11. They go the extra mile

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.540
both literally and figuratively

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.120
They enjoy their space so long distance relationships don't scare them away

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.520
If they're always checking on you and go out of their way to do you favours

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.260
they definitely have a soft spot for you

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.280
12. They give you feedback.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.500
We all get a little frustrated along the way when we try to achieve our dreams

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.500
But you can always count on an introvert to offer great advice

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.660
If they always catch you when you're falling, you're a star in their pocket

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.180
13. They step out of their comfort zone.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.480
Introverts are wild differently than extroverts

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.380
and prefer to watch on the sidelines before jumping in

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.220
But when an introvert likes you, they're willing to make a move and try something new

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.560
Do any of these signs resonate with you?

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.780
Do you love an introvert?

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:13.940
I know I love an introvert

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.000
