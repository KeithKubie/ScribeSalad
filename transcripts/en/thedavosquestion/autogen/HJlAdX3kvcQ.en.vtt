The one thing everybody of us needs to do
is to support bird life shelters. Buy some

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.849
shelters. We've got five million of them for
sale. You can buy a thousand shelters and

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:18.610
we'll give you a certificate. If you save
the birds it means you're concerned about

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.529
the environment. If you're concerned about
the environment, you'll be concerned about

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.981
climate change. And finally we'll solve the
problems of the world.
