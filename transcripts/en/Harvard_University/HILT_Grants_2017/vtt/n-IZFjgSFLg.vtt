00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.570
The project was
to develop spaces,

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.560
both physical and virtual,
that would allow students

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.870
and faculty from across
the university to engage

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.510
in thinking through making.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:20.090
We got into it, I think, through
our collaborative teaching

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.000
in the Harvard
architecture studies

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.870
undergraduate track, which is in
its fifth year now at Harvard.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.170
So new, but there is
an increasing interest

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.540
from students at the college to
study through physical making

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.220
and visual output.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.860
So we are interested in
finding ways to support that

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.670
but also to link that work to
things going on more broadly

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.370
across Harvard
University's campus.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.250
So that was our real
agenda, is to be

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.640
able to bolster and support
and connect this already

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.800
ongoing project to other
initiatives that are

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.930
similar across the university.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.040
And we had noticed that
students and faculty were

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.963
engaged in making projects.

00:01:06.963 --> 00:01:08.880
They were actually
physically producing things

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.253
for their other courses.

00:01:11.253 --> 00:01:13.170
And we were interested
in trying to figure out

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.050
how to foster real
conversation about the objects

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.100
that they were making.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.840
So not just thinking
about the technical skills

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.620
but actually the
discourse that surrounds

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.250
producing objects as
a mode of research

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.540
and of knowledge production.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.020
This space is among
the first to address

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.320
student academic
pursuits in terms

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.600
of thinking through making.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.620
And our grant helps support
the outfitting of that space

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.390
through technical means
for these students.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.350
We also, through the
support of the grant,

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.110
created a website to
be able to disseminate

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.340
and create a kind of visual
means of analysis of what

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.340
the students are making.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.730
So the website really
features student work

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.380
made through processes of
physical modeling or drawing

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.910
that is iterative and
also evolutionary.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.760
It changes as you study
different versions

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.630
and permutations of an idea.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.550
And the website really enables
both students and faculty

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.450
across the university to look
at what this process produced

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.220
and hopefully, affects
how we start thinking

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.830
about adjustments to
the pedagogy of the two

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.650
studios related to all of
that feedback and reception.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.150
Yeah.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.813
And I think that's
really important.

00:02:37.813 --> 00:02:40.230
Because we don't think of this
just as the physical making

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.730
space.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.520
But, really, that
virtual discursive space

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.020
is really a part of the project.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.590
And that's really
important for us.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.512
And for us, that was
a big part of what we

00:02:50.512 --> 00:02:51.720
are interested in developing.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.137
So not just a maker space where
students could come and do

00:02:54.137 --> 00:02:55.740
independent projects
but, really,

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.430
a space that was both
physical and intellectual

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.100
for them to be able to
talk through architectural

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.430
discourse, what objects
they were producing

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.740
meant, in a sense.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:06.240
Architects.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.090
They were already embedded
in architectural culture.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.430
They have technical
skills that allow

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.740
them to produce objects that are
recognizable as architecture.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.950
The students that come
into architecture studies,

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.560
and the students that are
interested in our making space,

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.693
by contrast, are coming
from a really wide range

00:03:21.693 --> 00:03:22.860
of disciplinary backgrounds.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.400
So we have people
from cellular biology,

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.810
from classics, from
engineering, from applied math.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.940
And they don't really
have preconceptions

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.360
of what architecture or what
architectural objects are,

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.590
which is really exciting.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.510
Because they have
this whole new lens

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.790
with which to look at the work.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.530
It's definitely
challenging, because it

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.330
means that we have
to bring everyone up

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.790
to speed in terms of
some technical skills

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.560
and in terms of the
language that we

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.310
use to talk about
architecture and the way

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.830
that we talk about
architectural objects.

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.920
But for us, it's been
really exciting to see

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.150
the multiplicity of
ideas and opinions

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.850
that comes out of
this interdisciplinary

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:03.720
collaborative space.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.803
And that's where the
interdisciplinary part of our

00:04:05.803 --> 00:04:06.510
project--

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.330
even though it's
definitely in architecture,

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.020
we think about it
as architecture

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.240
with broad
interdisciplinary reach.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.250
Yeah.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.839
It's been interesting to craft
a website that also starts

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:22.440
to select and bring
together examples of student

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.870
work produced in the two
studios, representative

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.290
of students interested in
this track of coursework,

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.180
coming from very
different disciplines.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:37.470
So it's also a way of
making visual and legible,

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.490
through means of
website representation,

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.380
a digital means of communication
to the university what

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.320
these different disciplines
threaded through architecture

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.697
as a combination
end up producing.

00:04:48.697 --> 00:04:50.780
In addition, it's been
wonderful working with Lisa

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.322
on this grant,
because even though we

00:04:52.322 --> 00:04:56.010
come at this topic from
two different studios,

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.860
addressing it together,
how interdisciplinary

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.010
critical thinking can
work through making spaces

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.610
has, I think, refined even
exactly how each of the two

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.152
studios address this topic--

00:05:07.152 --> 00:05:07.860
Yeah, definitely.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.235
--and then complement
each other.

00:05:09.235 --> 00:05:12.960
So it's been super
helpful, also,

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.950
in terms of shaping
and refining the focus

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.320
of our respective classes.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.260
And I think that has a much
further reach going forward

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.750
than just the duration of
this grant, which is really

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.600
lovely to have as the outcome.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.310
I think, perhaps,
what's come out

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.950
of this, though maybe not
matching one-to-one what

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.040
we had anticipated
to be the outcomes,

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.270
is probably more
productive and actually

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.090
more focused in
many ways to feed

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.500
the college and the development
of this course of study moving

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.000
forward.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.380
So I think to be flexible is
an important piece of advice

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.300
that I don't know that we maybe
had foreshadowed or anticipated

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.280
quite as much.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.130
I think having a
visible platform

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.800
for the work that
we're doing is for me,

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.380
an immediate mark of success.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.630
We're attracting more
students to the studios

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:14.490
and generating more interest
in architecture studies.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.640
But I think just
having that visibility

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.460
for me is one marker,
and an important one,

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:21.710
of the success of the project.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:22.220
I agree.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.790
I think the visibility
with the website,

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:29.390
I would imagine, will have a
lasting and longer duration

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.090
effect and be a mode
of measuring success

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.970
that we don't really
have all the data on yet.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.120
Part of the idea of this project
is that it doesn't end now

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.620
but that we've
set up a framework

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.960
to be able to continue
to showcase work,

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.060
to continue this conversation.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.480
And that was part of what
we had imagined all along,

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.380
was that this was the kindling
for an ongoing, longer-term

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.500
conversation and that we now
have a pretty robust framework

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.600
for making sure that
people can become

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.120
engaged when they want to.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.160
And also, that that
framework can evolve.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:06.650
So if initiatives
in other departments

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:10.940
appeared or found resonance with
things going on in the studios,

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.390
or the studios started to
partner with other faculty,

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:16.790
that this website
would enable us a way

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:21.200
to describe the evolution
of this series of studios

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.140
available to the students
over the life of the program.

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.290
This is the kind of thing that
I feel like maybe, in the past,

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:29.000
we'd have to do
secretly, like, what

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.990
are some innovative
ways of teaching?

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.880
That now, it feels exciting
that it actually is fully

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.910
acknowledged as being valuable
in terms of creative thinking

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:41.000
in the classroom that has
real intellectual weight

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.640
and that that doesn't
have to be something that

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.840
flies below the radar anymore.
