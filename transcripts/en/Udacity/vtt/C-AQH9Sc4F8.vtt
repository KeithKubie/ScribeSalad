00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.594
There was, however, a reason that the panda population ended up as an

00:00:03.594 --> 00:00:07.527
endangered species. And that was because their population declined to a

00:00:07.527 --> 00:00:11.740
dangerously low number. More pandas were dying each year than being born since

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.510
they had lost huge portions of their habitat, making food and mates difficult

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.630
to find. Now, even though Gloria's Giant Panda Preserve is doing very well

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.850
rehabilitating its population, pandas are actually still endangered worldwide.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.230
Preserves like hers are one of the ways that hopefully pandas will no longer be

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.760
endangered anymore someday. Their overall population will one day get to a much

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.904
healthier size. Which of these statements I've just written do you think makes

00:00:37.904 --> 00:00:42.390
the most sense in terms of the decline of the panda population? A constant

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.672
number of pandas died each year. The larger the population, the more pandas

00:00:46.672 --> 00:00:51.106
died each year. And the smaller the population the fewer died each year. Or

00:00:51.106 --> 00:00:55.075
finally, the larger the population the fewer pandas died each year, and the

00:00:55.075 --> 00:00:58.990
smaller the population, the more died each year.
