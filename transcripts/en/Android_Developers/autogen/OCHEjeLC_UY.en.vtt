lighting up less pixels on the screen
 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.289
lighting up less pixels on the screen
we've seen significant reductions in

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299
we've seen significant reductions in
 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.050
we've seen significant reductions in
power usage in fact in our tests we've

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060
power usage in fact in our tests we've
 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.910
power usage in fact in our tests we've
seen up to 60 percent reduction in power

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920
seen up to 60 percent reduction in power

which can be a real user benefit and
 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.050
which can be a real user benefit and
lastly dark themes can support

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060
lastly dark themes can support

sufficient contrast ratios they have

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799
sufficient contrast ratios they have
 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.530
sufficient contrast ratios they have
less eye strain on the user so they

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540
less eye strain on the user so they
 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.060
less eye strain on the user so they
could be used by certain classes of user

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070
could be used by certain classes of user
 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.410
could be used by certain classes of user
much more comfortably so for those

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420
much more comfortably so for those
 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.630
much more comfortably so for those
reasons we've introduced a new system

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640
reasons we've introduced a new system
 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.569

setting in Android cue so now under the

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579
setting in Android cue so now under the
 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.819

between a light or a dark theme you can
 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.249
between a light or a dark theme you can
also use a new quick settings toggle to

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259
also use a new quick settings toggle to
 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.319
also use a new quick settings toggle to
quickly flip between those modes and the

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329
quickly flip between those modes and the
 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.090

device will automatically kick into dark

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100

saver now it's important to note that

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030
saver now it's important to note that
 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.450
saver now it's important to note that
dark theme is actually a system-wide

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460
dark theme is actually a system-wide
 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.700
dark theme is actually a system-wide
setting not just for the system UI but

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710
setting not just for the system UI but
 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.560
setting not just for the system UI but
it applies to all apps running on the

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570
it applies to all apps running on the
 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.499
it applies to all apps running on the
device and as such we think that users

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509
device and as such we think that users
 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.719
device and as such we think that users
are going to increasingly expect your

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729
are going to increasingly expect your
 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.280
are going to increasingly expect your
applications that you're writing to

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290
applications that you're writing to
 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.760
applications that you're writing to
respond when they set this system toggle

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770
respond when they set this system toggle
 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.809
respond when they set this system toggle
so here for example I've got two apps

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819
so here for example I've got two apps
 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.699
so here for example I've got two apps
running in split screen and when I

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709
running in split screen and when I
 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.070
running in split screen and when I
topple into a dark theme we can see that

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080
topple into a dark theme we can see that
 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.699
topple into a dark theme we can see that
only one of

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709
only one of
 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.069
only one of
responds and we think the users are

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.079
responds and we think the users are
 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:18.080
responds and we think the users are
going to increasingly expect your

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090
going to increasingly expect your
 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.319
going to increasingly expect your
application to follow this now I've

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:21.329
application to follow this now I've
 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.149
application to follow this now I've
picked on Google Drive here because

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159
picked on Google Drive here because
 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:24.530
picked on Google Drive here because
they're not currently supporting that

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540
they're not currently supporting that
 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.330
they're not currently supporting that
theme but all Google applications are

dark theme by the time Android cue rolls
 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.059
dark theme by the time Android cue rolls
out so this is only going to increase

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069
out so this is only going to increase
 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.190
out so this is only going to increase
the user expectations so as such we

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200
the user expectations so as such we
 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.959
the user expectations so as such we
strongly recommend that you look at

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:35.969
strongly recommend that you look at
 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:37.099
strongly recommend that you look at
supporting dark theme in your

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:37.109
supporting dark theme in your
 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:39.740
supporting dark theme in your
applications now we recognize that's

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750
applications now we recognize that's
 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:40.910
applications now we recognize that's
going to be in some work for the

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920
going to be in some work for the

well let's take a look so here's the end
 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:02:59.690
well let's take a look so here's the end
Google i/o application and here it is

it runs at rendering time and it

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319
it runs at rendering time and it
 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.259
it runs at rendering time and it
actually inspects the views that it's

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269
actually inspects the views that it's
 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.869

which ones should be inverted in order
 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.500
which ones should be inverted in order
to run dark it even does some clever

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510
to run dark it even does some clever
 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.689

the second reason why we think it's
important to go custom is it gives you

important to go custom is it gives you
up most control over exactly how your

all of your activities if you need a
 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.480
all of your activities if you need a
local override in a specific activity we

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:02.490
local override in a specific activity we
 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.050
local override in a specific activity we
have set local night mode now one thing

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:06.060
have set local night mode now one thing
 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.149
have set local night mode now one thing
to note is that the values set on these

00:07:08.149 --> 00:07:08.159
to note is that the values set on these
 

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:11.029
to note is that the values set on these
api's are not persisted so therefore you

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:11.039
api's are not persisted so therefore you
 

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:13.249
api's are not persisted so therefore you
need to set what you use the method

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:13.259
need to set what you use the method
 

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:15.920
need to set what you use the method
whenever your process brought up usually

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:15.930
whenever your process brought up usually
 

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.480

I'll do this in your application object

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:19.490
 
 

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.469
 
using those API you need to give it a

00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:21.479
using those API you need to give it a
 

00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:24.200
using those API you need to give it a
mode and we offer four main modes the

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:24.210
mode and we offer four main modes the
 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.029
mode and we offer four main modes the
first is mode light yes which means

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:26.039
first is mode light yes which means
 

00:07:26.039 --> 00:07:28.939
first is mode light yes which means
always dark mode night no which is

00:07:28.939 --> 00:07:28.949
always dark mode night no which is
 

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:31.999
always dark mode night no which is
always light follow system which will

00:07:31.999 --> 00:07:32.009
always light follow system which will
 

00:07:32.009 --> 00:07:33.920
always light follow system which will
follow the current system setting now on

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:33.930
follow the current system setting now on
 

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:35.570
follow the current system setting now on
cue because we have a new system setting

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:35.580
cue because we have a new system setting
 

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.610
cue because we have a new system setting
which is great it will do that basically

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:37.620
which is great it will do that basically
 

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.379
which is great it will do that basically
whenever the system city has changed

00:07:39.379 --> 00:07:39.389
whenever the system city has changed
 

00:07:39.389 --> 00:07:42.350
whenever the system city has changed
your app will follow it and when you run

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:42.360
your app will follow it and when you run
 

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.540
your app will follow it and when you run
on devices before cubes a PI or earlier

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:44.550
on devices before cubes a PI or earlier
 

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:46.550
on devices before cubes a PI or earlier
it will usually default to all white

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:46.560
it will usually default to all white
 

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:50.899
it will usually default to all white
theme the next new mode is called Auto

00:07:50.899 --> 00:07:50.909
theme the next new mode is called Auto
 

00:07:50.909 --> 00:07:52.640
theme the next new mode is called Auto
battery which you've added in app compat

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:52.650
battery which you've added in app compat
 

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:55.399
battery which you've added in app compat
1.1 and that is goes dark whether the

00:07:55.399 --> 00:07:55.409
1.1 and that is goes dark whether the
 

00:07:55.409 --> 00:07:57.350
1.1 and that is goes dark whether the
battery saver feature is enabled and it

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:57.360
battery saver feature is enabled and it
 

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.230
battery saver feature is enabled and it
works back to api 21 so here is it the

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:00.240
works back to api 21 so here is it the
 

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.640
works back to api 21 so here is it the
scene example where a device is going

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:01.650
scene example where a device is going
 

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:04.129
scene example where a device is going
into battery saving mode when that

00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:04.139
into battery saving mode when that
 

00:08:04.139 --> 00:08:06.399
into battery saving mode when that
happens or out or automatically go dark

00:08:06.399 --> 00:08:06.409
happens or out or automatically go dark
 

00:08:06.409 --> 00:08:08.809
happens or out or automatically go dark
when the user plugs the device back in

00:08:08.809 --> 00:08:08.819
when the user plugs the device back in
 

00:08:08.819 --> 00:08:10.040
when the user plugs the device back in
so it goes about to charge it and

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:10.050
so it goes about to charge it and
 

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:11.420
so it goes about to charge it and
therefore we leave battery saving mode

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:11.430
therefore we leave battery saving mode
 

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:16.809
therefore we leave battery saving mode
like so all automatic go lights again

00:08:16.809 --> 00:08:16.819
 
 

00:08:16.819 --> 00:08:19.070
 
the final thing to check is to make sure

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:19.080
the final thing to check is to make sure
 

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.510
the final thing to check is to make sure
that your activities are extended from

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:20.520
that your activities are extended from
 

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.619
that your activities are extended from
app compat activity

00:08:21.619 --> 00:08:21.629
app compat activity
 

00:08:21.629 --> 00:08:23.659
app compat activity
this may sound super obvious but it's

00:08:23.659 --> 00:08:23.669
this may sound super obvious but it's
 

00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:27.070
this may sound super obvious but it's
something which is easy forgotten

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:27.080
 
 

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.140
 
so as I said earlier we've been hard at

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:29.150
so as I said earlier we've been hard at
 

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:30.309
so as I said earlier we've been hard at
work over the past couple of months to

00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:30.319
work over the past couple of months to
 

00:08:30.319 --> 00:08:31.920
work over the past couple of months to
improve day night the day/night feature

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:31.930
improve day night the day/night feature
 

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:33.850
improve day night the day/night feature
and so I'd like to take you through some

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:33.860
and so I'd like to take you through some
 

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:35.649
and so I'd like to take you through some
of the things we've done so one key

00:08:35.649 --> 00:08:35.659
of the things we've done so one key
 

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:37.570
of the things we've done so one key
change is that set default light mode

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:37.580
change is that set default light mode
 

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:38.980
change is that set default light mode
and that recreates any visible

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:38.990

activities it previously didn't do this
 

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:42.490
activities it previously didn't do this
and you had to do all that work yourself

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:42.500
and you had to do all that work yourself
 

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.800
and you had to do all that work yourself
whereas we now do it for you we also

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:44.810
whereas we now do it for you we also
 

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:46.449
whereas we now do it for you we also
have an incompatibility with webview

00:08:46.449 --> 00:08:46.459
have an incompatibility with webview
 

00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:48.190
have an incompatibility with webview
whereas if you're using day/night and

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:48.200
whereas if you're using day/night and
 

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.170
whereas if you're using day/night and
then later inflated webview we'd reset

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:50.180
then later inflated webview we'd reset
 

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:51.490

set elevation or set translation Z which
will give you this overlay behavior if

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:49.050
will give you this overlay behavior if
 

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:51.710
will give you this overlay behavior if
you can't use a material shape drawable

you can't use a material shape drawable
 

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.569
you can't use a material shape drawable
for some reason you can instead take a

for some reason you can instead take a
look at the elevation overlay provider

00:11:55.189 --> 00:11:55.199

running at a dark theme what you need to
 

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:14.030
running at a dark theme what you need to
do is provide an alternative color when

dark theme so here for example I'm

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:33.240
dark theme so here for example I'm
 

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.480
dark theme so here for example I'm
changing the hard-coded background from

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:35.490
changing the hard-coded background from
 

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:37.880
changing the hard-coded background from
white to materials color surface color

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:37.890
white to materials color surface color
 

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:40.010
white to materials color surface color
which is a kind of background color and

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:40.020
which is a kind of background color and
 

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:42.050
which is a kind of background color and
so that will flip from white in a light

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:42.060
so that will flip from white in a light
 

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:44.600
so that will flip from white in a light
theme to a very dark grey when running

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:44.610
theme to a very dark grey when running
 

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:46.610

on a dark theme or likewise I'm using

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:46.620
on a dark theme or likewise I'm using
 

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:49.100
on a dark theme or likewise I'm using
the platform's text color primary here

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:49.110
the platform's text color primary here
 

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:50.750
the platform's text color primary here
for the text color which will give you

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:50.760
for the text color which will give you
 

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.340
for the text color which will give you
the inverse of that so it will be dark

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:52.350
the inverse of that so it will be dark
 

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:53.990
the inverse of that so it will be dark
in the light theme and light in the dark

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:54.000
in the light theme and light in the dark
 

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.750
in the light theme and light in the dark
theme in fact if you take a look at the

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:56.760
theme in fact if you take a look at the
 

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.670
theme in fact if you take a look at the
material color system it has lots of

00:13:58.670 --> 00:13:58.680
material color system it has lots of
 

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.079
material color system it has lots of
these semantically named colors which is

00:14:00.079 --> 00:14:00.089
these semantically named colors which is
 

00:14:00.089 --> 00:14:02.390
these semantically named colors which is
super useful to be and for using in your

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:02.400
super useful to be and for using in your
 

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.000
super useful to be and for using in your
and designs so you're probably familiar

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:05.010
and designs so you're probably familiar
 

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:06.440
and designs so you're probably familiar
with things like color primarycolour

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:06.450
with things like color primarycolour
 

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:08.750
with things like color primarycolour
secondarycolour accents on and but

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:08.760
secondarycolour accents on and but
 

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.040
secondarycolour accents on and but
here's the surface color that we looked

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:10.050
here's the surface color that we looked
 

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:12.019
here's the surface color that we looked
at before and but they also provide a

00:14:12.019 --> 00:14:12.029
at before and but they also provide a
 

00:14:12.029 --> 00:14:14.390
at before and but they also provide a
series of on colors so if colors which

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:14.400
series of on colors so if colors which
 

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.490
series of on colors so if colors which
will contrast on top of their relevant

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:16.500
will contrast on top of their relevant
 

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.530
will contrast on top of their relevant
color so on primary one secondary on

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:18.540
color so on primary one secondary on
 

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:21.170
color so on primary one secondary on
surface so for example the on surface

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:21.180
surface so for example the on surface
 

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:22.250
surface so for example the on surface
color is a color which will always

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:22.260
color is a color which will always
 

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:23.780
color is a color which will always
contrast on top of that background

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:23.790
contrast on top of that background
 

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:27.079
contrast on top of that background
surface color so we can use this in

00:14:27.079 --> 00:14:27.089
surface color so we can use this in
 

00:14:27.089 --> 00:14:29.000
surface color so we can use this in
combination with a neat trick that color

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:29.010
combination with a neat trick that color
 

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:31.160
combination with a neat trick that color
state lists provide and to great effect

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:31.170
state lists provide and to great effect
 

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:33.590
state lists provide and to great effect
during dark meat dot themes so for

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:33.600
during dark meat dot themes so for
 

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.630
during dark meat dot themes so for
example here I'm using the fact that

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:35.640
example here I'm using the fact that
 

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.310
example here I'm using the fact that
color state list lets you separate out

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:37.320
color state list lets you separate out
 

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.500
color state list lets you separate out
the color from the Alpha Channel and

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:39.510
the color from the Alpha Channel and
 

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:41.480
the color from the Alpha Channel and
define them separately so I'm grabbing

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:41.490
define them separately so I'm grabbing
 

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:43.010
define them separately so I'm grabbing
the color on surface so something that

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:43.020
the color on surface so something that
 

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.569
the color on surface so something that
will always contrast the surface color

00:14:44.569 --> 00:14:44.579
will always contrast the surface color
 

00:14:44.579 --> 00:14:46.550
will always contrast the surface color
and applying an alpha modification to it

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:46.560
and applying an alpha modification to it
 

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.640
and applying an alpha modification to it
so this can be super useful if you want

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:49.650
so this can be super useful if you want
 

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:51.590
so this can be super useful if you want

monochrome icons that you just want them
 

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.810
monochrome icons that you just want them
to change the entire color of them so

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:02.820
to change the entire color of them so
 

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:03.890
to change the entire color of them so
you can tint it a couple of levels you

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:03.900
you can tint it a couple of levels you
 

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:05.690
you can tint it a couple of levels you
can either tint at the view level here

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:05.700
can either tint at the view level here
 

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:08.240
can either tint at the view level here
so here I am gonna tint whatever the

so will update it depending on the theme

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:13.650
so will update it depending on the theme
 

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:15.740
so will update it depending on the theme
or hopefully you're using vector

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:15.750
or hopefully you're using vector
 

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:17.690
or hopefully you're using vector
drawables and throughout your app your

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:17.700
drawables and throughout your app your
 

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.670
drawables and throughout your app your
and assets which natively support

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:19.680

tinting on the root element of the
 

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:22.760
tinting on the root element of the
vector so here I'm setting the color

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:22.770
vector so here I'm setting the color
 

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:24.950
vector so here I'm setting the color
control normal theme attribute which is

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:24.960
control normal theme attribute which is
 

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:27.200
control normal theme attribute which is
the standard and kind of gray icon color

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:27.210
the standard and kind of gray icon color
 

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:29.000
the standard and kind of gray icon color
so setting this means your icons will

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:29.010
so setting this means your icons will
 

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:32.630
so setting this means your icons will
always be the exactly right color or if

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:32.640
always be the exactly right color or if
 

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:33.800
always be the exactly right color or if
you're working in code you could also

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:33.810
you're working in code you could also
 

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:36.020
you're working in code you could also
use the drawable compact class which can

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:36.030
use the drawable compact class which can
 

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:38.300
use the drawable compact class which can
apply it in dynamically and to a

apply it in dynamically and to a
 

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:41.420

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:07.779
here but you know I opened up a photo
into the Photos app and I wanted to crop

00:33:07.779 --> 00:33:07.789
into the Photos app and I wanted to crop
 

00:33:07.789 --> 00:33:09.930
into the Photos app and I wanted to crop
a picture and crop my buddy out and

00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:09.940
a picture and crop my buddy out and
 

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:12.700
a picture and crop my buddy out and
you'll realize that the crop handles the

you'll realize that the crop handles the
 

00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:14.769
you'll realize that the crop handles the
little circles you can see on each

corner of that square are awfully close
 

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:20.649
corner of that square are awfully close
to the edge and unfortunately those are

00:33:20.649 --> 00:33:20.659
to the edge and unfortunately those are

that opt-out able but basically how the
 

00:34:01.879 --> 00:34:06.089
that opt-out able but basically how the
API works is that you can specify a

for the user to be able to actually drag
 

00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:23.510
for the user to be able to actually drag
it so here we'll look an example where

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:23.520
it so here we'll look an example where
 

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.310
it so here we'll look an example where
we haven't done that and you can see

on components and it provides peak
 

00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:53.190
on components and it provides peak
height so that's something that's the

00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:53.200
height so that's something that's the
 

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:54.569

and then we'll just increase that peak

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:01.210
and then we'll just increase that peak
 

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:04.920
and then we'll just increase that peak
height now it's also about having view

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:04.930

so draggable content near the gesture

00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:31.060
