I set out on my journey in July of 2016
 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.480
I set out on my journey in July of 2016
and so there's not really any easy fix

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490
and so there's not really any easy fix
 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.839

and as a result you know one of the key
 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:27.179
and as a result you know one of the key
components I believe is the way in which

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.189

that's where it really all starts what I
 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:33.389
that's where it really all starts what I
found out over the last couple of years

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:33.399
found out over the last couple of years
 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.880
found out over the last couple of years
is that we spend an inordinate amount of

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890
is that we spend an inordinate amount of
 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.550
is that we spend an inordinate amount of
time trying to empower our young girls

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:38.560
time trying to empower our young girls
 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.410
time trying to empower our young girls

in the in the way in which we call it a
 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.700
in the in the way in which we call it a
woman's issue first of all there's

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710
woman's issue first of all there's
 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.050
woman's issue first of all there's
almost a negative connotation that comes

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060
almost a negative connotation that comes
 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.530
almost a negative connotation that comes
with that unfortunately and the other

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540
with that unfortunately and the other
 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.180
with that unfortunately and the other
variant with that is that men just tune

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190
variant with that is that men just tune
 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.070
variant with that is that men just tune
out not because they don't care about it

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080
out not because they don't care about it
 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.390
out not because they don't care about it
they just are like oh I don't have to

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400
they just are like oh I don't have to
 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.280
they just are like oh I don't have to
worry about that and so with our sons we

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290
worry about that and so with our sons we
 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.530
worry about that and so with our sons we
keep thinking that the way in which

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540
keep thinking that the way in which
 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:26.850
keep thinking that the way in which
we're gonna fix this problem is to

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860
we're gonna fix this problem is to
 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.020
we're gonna fix this problem is to
empower our young girls more but we're

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030
empower our young girls more but we're
 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.240
empower our young girls more but we're
already doing a great job at that so

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250
already doing a great job at that so
 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.820
already doing a great job at that so
really where we need to be focused is

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830
really where we need to be focused is
 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.250
really where we need to be focused is
what are we telling our sons how are we

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.260
what are we telling our sons how are we
 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.149
what are we telling our sons how are we

you're in the company of a woman and
that's when you're you know at a

that's when you're you know at a
 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:30.630
that's when you're you know at a
restaurant and that's when you're in the

restaurant and that's when you're in the
 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.210
restaurant and that's when you're in the
workplace so men know how to treat women

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220
workplace so men know how to treat women
 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.010

but teaching our young boys is an
 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.920
but teaching our young boys is an
essential part of this equation I don't

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930
essential part of this equation I don't
 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.900
essential part of this equation I don't
know if during middle school boys have

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910
know if during middle school boys have
 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.270

in five girls will be raped on a college

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750
in five girls will be raped on a college
 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.540
in five girls will be raped on a college
campus and that they may be actually one

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550
campus and that they may be actually one
 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.280
campus and that they may be actually one
of those boys that may end up doing that

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290
of those boys that may end up doing that
 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.160
of those boys that may end up doing that
but I do think that it goes back to the

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170
but I do think that it goes back to the
 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.930
but I do think that it goes back to the
whole parenting issue and having the

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940
whole parenting issue and having the
 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.400
whole parenting issue and having the
courage to have these conversations with

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410
courage to have these conversations with
 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.380
courage to have these conversations with
your children and quite honestly I

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390
your children and quite honestly I
 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.670
your children and quite honestly I
believe that there should be curriculum

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680
believe that there should be curriculum
 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.280
believe that there should be curriculum
in school where you know this is

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290
in school where you know this is
 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.920
in school where you know this is
something that from fourth grade on or

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930
something that from fourth grade on or
 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.410
something that from fourth grade on or
fifth grade on that that this is part of

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420
fifth grade on that that this is part of
 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.680
fifth grade on that that this is part of
sex education listen the kids are

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690
sex education listen the kids are
 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.750
sex education listen the kids are
learning about everything else in school

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760
learning about everything else in school
 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.890
learning about everything else in school
I was stunned to find out what my kids

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900
I was stunned to find out what my kids
 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.340
I was stunned to find out what my kids
were being taught about sex in school

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350
were being taught about sex in school
 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.650
were being taught about sex in school
but they need to be because this is

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660
but they need to be because this is
 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.910
but they need to be because this is

what's going on in our world right now
 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.310
what's going on in our world right now
so I guess the conclusion I've come to

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320
so I guess the conclusion I've come to
 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.160
so I guess the conclusion I've come to
is that you have to tackle this head-on

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170
is that you have to tackle this head-on
 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.840
is that you have to tackle this head-on
have the courage to have these

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850

somebody else can do the work for me but

that's setting the tone from you know
 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.490
that's setting the tone from you know
from a boys perspective I can't know or

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500
from a boys perspective I can't know or
 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.100
from a boys perspective I can't know or
understand boys who end up being

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110
understand boys who end up being
 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.800
understand boys who end up being
predators what happens along the way

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810
predators what happens along the way
 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:59.210
predators what happens along the way
that makes them choose those paths but I

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220
