00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.620
One of the most basic features of being a
boy, so well-entrenched that we forget to

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.589
notice its strangeness, is that after a certain
point, mothers become embarrassing and need

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:17.500
to be surrendered and denied, not just mothers,
but all that mothers tend to stand for in

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.940
a boy’s life: tenderness, vulnerability
and need. To become a man is to grow into

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.140
the creature who says ‘not now’ to his
mother – and doesn’t look back as he walks

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.620
towards his friends in the school yard. Mothers
become so-called embarrassing, because they

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.230
know all the areas in which one is not perhaps
quite the man one claims to be to the world.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.800
Mothers have the map to the forbidden aspects
of one’s personality: they know where one

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.780
is afraid, in need of reassurance, playful
and easily moved by small and delicate things.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:59.140
The mother stands, in the symbolic imagination,
as the guardian of the denied male self, of

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.710
all that was renounced on the path to that
dishonest brittle state we term masculine

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.470
adulthood. The denial of the mother is at
the root of what makes so much of adult society

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.900
heartless. We refuse to nurture one another
because we have refused to face up to the

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.409
way we were once nurtured; we behave like
people who are doing their very best to forget

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.700
their own less robust and more dependent selves.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:35.340
In the summer of 1978, the French literary critic Roland Barthes
wrote a fascinating letter to his good friend,

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.270
the novelist Philippe Sollers. He told Sollers
that he’d been spending the month of August

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.080
re-reading Proust and that he had drawn from
the experience the courage no longer to refer

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:53.630
to his mother as ‘my mother’ but rather
to call her publicly ‘maman.’ He was at

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:00.700
this point 63 years old. The passage needs
to be unpacked. The French language is particularly

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:07.729
and instructively clear about mothers. There
are two ways to refer to this figure in French:

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:16.120
Mère = Mother Maman = a far cosier word,
more dignified than Mummy, but more intimate

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.760
and less off-hand than Mum, still redolent
of childhood dependence and care. ‘Mum’

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.380
is someone you occasionally send a card to;
‘maman’ is someone whose caresses you

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.840
miss. One of the many remarkable things about
Marcel Proust, the greatest writer that France

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.410
has ever produced, is that throughout his
novel, In Search of Lost Time, he refers constantly

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.770
to his mother as ‘Maman’. He does not,
as all serious French writers had done hitherto,

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:52.959
call her ‘ma mère’; he deliberately and
with calculated intent sticks to the far more

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:59.230
vulnerable ‘maman’, insisting thereby
on acknowledging the simultaneous existence

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:06.310
in his own mind of adult and child selves.
He performs a major rehabilitation, sketching

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:12.550
a new ideal of masculinity that is properly
in dialogue with childhood need. What is so

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:18.950
revealing is that Barthes speaks of stumbling,
in late middle age, on what he calls the courage

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.650
to refer to his own mother as ‘maman’.
He admits that it takes bravery to be open

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.830
to his boyhood self. He has to lean on the
prestige of another writer to take an apparently

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:38.190
insignificant but deeply symbolic and daunting
step: that of daring, as a grown-up man, to

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:44.629
make a public declaration of his previously-denied
longings for his mother. Or, to put it another

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:51.050
way, Barthes is learning that real men do
not shun their mothers; that grown-up men

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.870
can be mummy’s boys. He is, along the way,
giving all men encouragement to travel with

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.090
greater ease between the masculine and the
feminine sides of their nature, and those

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:08.070
of the adult and the child, rather than deny
and split, partition and then stamp on the

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:20.640
denied parts. We become real men when we know
how publicly to proclaim, with pride and tenderness, that we are mummy’s boys.
