1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,430
Jocko.
I've got a question regarding the quote.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,900
If there is a doubt, there is no doubt.
Oh, right. I remember that from last time.

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:12,250
Okay. This would seem to indicate
avoiding taking risks. Many,

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,820
many businesses or many
business decisions involve risk.

5
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:20,020
Often there can be a doubt
about either of two options,

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,680
doubt that you should maintain the
status quo and doubt about pursuing a new

7
00:00:23,681 --> 00:00:28,681
opportunity to frequent or you
frequently talk about dichotomies.

8
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,150
Would you mind sharing your
thoughts on this principle?

9
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,170
Yeah,
this is,

10
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:37,230
this is a classic thing in and it's a
great point and that's why these little

11
00:00:37,601 --> 00:00:38,890
sound bites can be a little bit dangerous.

12
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,730
Sometimes we use a little little power
soundbites because they are that simple

13
00:00:42,731 --> 00:00:44,890
and of course I've loved, I
like things to be simple, right?

14
00:00:44,891 --> 00:00:47,770
That's the number two law of
combat is to keep things simple.

15
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,640
But sometimes things like this need a
little bit of amplifying information and

16
00:00:51,641 --> 00:00:51,971
yes,

17
00:00:51,971 --> 00:00:56,971
this could be construed as being
extremely risk averse and like,

18
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:58,391
hey,

19
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:02,800
if I have any doubt about the safety of
success of this mission that we're not

20
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,350
going to do it.
Which if that was the case,

21
00:01:05,351 --> 00:01:09,040
then I would have done a zero missions
during my deployments to Iraq.

22
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,470
Uh, same with business. Never
would have started victory.

23
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,320
MMA never would've started echelon
front cause there was risk involved in

24
00:01:17,321 --> 00:01:18,250
starting those things.

25
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:22,080
Never would have done anything really
because there's always going to be doubts.

26
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:26,260
So this is a accurate statement and
of course every business has risk.

27
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:31,060
And so, so I guess that idea
that if there is a doubt,

28
00:01:31,061 --> 00:01:35,380
there is no doubt is not to be taken
literally when it comes to risk,

29
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,720
when it comes to risk,
don't take it literally.

30
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:42,430
But what it should be I think
is like a a warning, right?

31
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:47,410
Like a little warning that's in your head.
If there's a doubt like,

32
00:01:47,411 --> 00:01:50,740
okay, we need to think about what's going
on here. We need to understand what,

33
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:54,100
what is at risk here
because,

34
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:57,490
and I just had this conversation with us,
CEO of a company. As a matter of fact,

35
00:01:57,491 --> 00:01:59,480
I was talking about the dichotomy of
leadership and I was talking about how,

36
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,890
you know, giving him examples.
I was like for instance in,

37
00:02:02,891 --> 00:02:05,740
and he was in a technology
company and I said, you know,

38
00:02:05,741 --> 00:02:10,150
if you didn't take risk you wouldn't,
you wouldn't make any progress,

39
00:02:10,151 --> 00:02:13,690
but if you took too much risk you wouldn't
be where you are right now because

40
00:02:13,691 --> 00:02:15,610
they're dominating. So
it's like, oh you're,

41
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,000
you're balancing that dichotomy all the
time. So if he would have said, hey,

42
00:02:19,001 --> 00:02:21,580
if there a doubt, there is no doubt he
never would have gotten off the ground.

43
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:22,900
Now,

44
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,900
where I think it becomes a more solid
statement is from like a moral or an

45
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,060
ethical standpoint.

46
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:35,740
And that is if you think that something
is wrong or that it probably is,

47
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,110
if you think you're doing something
that you probably shouldn't be doing,

48
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,900
then there's doubt and you
probably shouldn't be doing it.

49
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:46,090
I think an easy way to keep yourself in
check and these days it's a very real

50
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,210
possibility. It's just if you think
that you're being recorded at all times,

51
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,700
like if you just think,
oh, I'm being recorded,

52
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,290
which probably somebody is recording you.

53
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,080
Like if you decide you think
you can get away with something,

54
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,940
you're probably not going to get
away with it. Look at all the,

55
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,060
just go watch youtube,
don't caught in the act or whatever.

56
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:03,880
People get caught all the time.
So whenever you're doing,

57
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,490
think that there could be somebody there
with a phone recording you and I think

58
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:09,880
that's keeps you a morally and
ethically in check. You know,

59
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:14,881
I used to tell my guys that you could be
getting watched by CNN or Al Jazeera or

60
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,730
some report. You know,
whoever you, you know,

61
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:21,820
you could be getting watched and if you're
doing something that you shouldn't be

62
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:24,640
doing, you're, you're gonna
get caught. So don't do it.

63
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:28,120
Not to mention these days we
got the aircraft overhead,
they can see everything.

64
00:03:28,121 --> 00:03:31,630
So do the right thing.
That's what you do.

65
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,560
You do the right thing.
Yeah.

66
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,150
If you have any doubt that what
you're doing is the right thing,

67
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,510
then you should probably shouldn't do it.
A lot of those,

68
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:45,040
a lot of the horrible
police actions, yeah. Are,

69
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,580
you know, recorded by some random
person with a phone. Now, of course,

70
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,450
I always need to point out that there's
all of these good actions that take

71
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:56,710
place every single day. Millions and
millions of police doing the right thing.

72
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:01,240
No one publishes those. No one uploads
those on to youtube or Facebook.

73
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:05,110
But the bad acts that are caught, they're
caught because someone has a camera.

74
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,480
And so like that's great advice for a cop.
Hey,

75
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:12,130
act like you're being recorded
all the time. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

76
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:16,450
That's interesting. Well, it may cause
you very well. Might be. Yeah. Yeah.

77
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,770
So do the right thing.
Next question.

78
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:25,270
Thank God I didn't have cameras when I
was a kid for all the dumb stuff I did.

79
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,980
Yeah. Uh, yeah. Well, I,

80
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,680
I always want to make sure that
I'm not sitting here saying like,

81
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,280
everyone out there should
do the right thing like me.

82
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,430
I'm not saying that if you
thought I was saying that,

83
00:04:36,431 --> 00:04:38,860
I'm not saying God that apologize
for even sounding that way.

84
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,120
Like I was as dumb and stupid as the
next person and still do dumb stuff.

85
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:49,300
Try not to get a man you don't
do dumb stuff. Right. You know,

86
00:04:49,301 --> 00:04:50,800
it was bad when, when, uh,

87
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,900
when we had Charlie plumb
and Jim conch on. Yeah.

88
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,480
And I'm like thinking they're like, you
know, hey, this is the way to act. Right?

89
00:04:58,481 --> 00:05:01,120
And I'm like, don't put me in
that category, but you guys,

90
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:06,370
you guys are awesome heroes
and I'm just over here. Yeah.

91
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:11,710
Don't say that about me. You guys can
say like, Hey, talk about character.

92
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,320
You have character.
I'm just over here trying to do

93
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:17,230
shit.
