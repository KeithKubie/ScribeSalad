lights I want to go over some slides
 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.479
lights I want to go over some slides
from last time which I didn't get a

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489
from last time which I didn't get a
 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.359
from last time which I didn't get a
chance to get to take the lights down

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369
chance to get to take the lights down
 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.890

for this now you remember I told you the

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900
for this now you remember I told you the
 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.359
for this now you remember I told you the
movie of flu exploding wasn't right I

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369
movie of flu exploding wasn't right I
 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.190
movie of flu exploding wasn't right I
just want to show you a still from the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200
just want to show you a still from the
 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.679
just want to show you a still from the
movie to show you why ok these are two

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689

the bottom they have this image with an

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500
the bottom they have this image with an
 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.060
the bottom they have this image with an
envelope around the capsid is that right

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070
envelope around the capsid is that right
 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:36.920
envelope around the capsid is that right
for influenza virus no what is she's

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930
for influenza virus no what is she's
 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.200
for influenza virus no what is she's
shaking your head no no it's not right

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210
shaking your head no no it's not right
 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.630
shaking your head no no it's not right
the influenza RNA is wrapped up in a

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640
the influenza RNA is wrapped up in a
 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.179
the influenza RNA is wrapped up in a
helical nucleocapsid not a capsid like

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189
helical nucleocapsid not a capsid like
 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.460
helical nucleocapsid not a capsid like
this so this is wrong and then when it

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470
this so this is wrong and then when it
 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.469
this so this is wrong and then when it
comes apart you see there triangles here

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479
comes apart you see there triangles here
 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.940
comes apart you see there triangles here
if you see a triangle what do you think

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950
if you see a triangle what do you think
 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.230
if you see a triangle what do you think
of icosahedron right this is not an

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240
of icosahedron right this is not an
 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.709
of icosahedron right this is not an
icosahedron so this is wrong the

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719
icosahedron so this is wrong the
 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.109
icosahedron so this is wrong the
artist's rendition is incorrect okay so

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119
artist's rendition is incorrect okay so
 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.090
artist's rendition is incorrect okay so
that's that remember flu is an envelope

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100
that's that remember flu is an envelope
 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.330
that's that remember flu is an envelope
virus with a nucleo capsid HeLa CLIA

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340
virus with a nucleo capsid HeLa CLIA
 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.919

arranged and it does have a protein

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929
arranged and it does have a protein
 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.280
arranged and it does have a protein
around it that forms a shell but it's

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290
around it that forms a shell but it's
 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.030
around it that forms a shell but it's
not called the cap

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040
not called the cap
 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.670
not called the cap
that's just the M protein which has a

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680
that's just the M protein which has a
 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.830
that's just the M protein which has a
variety of other functions okay so

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840
variety of other functions okay so
 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.960
variety of other functions okay so
that's what's wrong with the movie then

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970
that's what's wrong with the movie then
 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.490
that's what's wrong with the movie then
we didn't finish at the end of last time

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500
we didn't finish at the end of last time
 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.929
we didn't finish at the end of last time
I just want to quickly go through a few

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:23.939
I just want to quickly go through a few
 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:27.140
I just want to quickly go through a few
slides one was to show you an example of

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150
slides one was to show you an example of
 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.130
slides one was to show you an example of
a virus that uses two two receptors to

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140
a virus that uses two two receptors to
 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.050
a virus that uses two two receptors to
attach to cells and I wanted to go

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060
attach to cells and I wanted to go
 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.250
attach to cells and I wanted to go
through this because maybe you're

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260
through this because maybe you're
 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.440
through this because maybe you're
thinking why would a virus need two

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450
thinking why would a virus need two
 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.750
thinking why would a virus need two
receptors shouldn't one be enough and in

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760
receptors shouldn't one be enough and in
 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.490
receptors shouldn't one be enough and in
theory yes because a lot of viruses in

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500
theory yes because a lot of viruses in
 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.190
theory yes because a lot of viruses in
fact use just one receptor but Coxsackie

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200
fact use just one receptor but Coxsackie
 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.800
fact use just one receptor but Coxsackie
Group B viruses need two one is called

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810
Group B viruses need two one is called
 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.580
Group B viruses need two one is called
DAF and the other is called car these

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590
DAF and the other is called car these
 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.649
DAF and the other is called car these
viruses initiate infection at the

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659
viruses initiate infection at the
 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:55.099
viruses initiate infection at the
epithelial surface like this but the

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109
epithelial surface like this but the
 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.500
epithelial surface like this but the
problem here is that car one of the two

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510
problem here is that car one of the two
 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.690
problem here is that car one of the two
receptors is a component of tight

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700
receptors is a component of tight
 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.910
receptors is a component of tight
junctions which are right here next to

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920
junctions which are right here next to
 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.670
junctions which are right here next to
cells not at the top so these receptors

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680
cells not at the top so these receptors
 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.170
cells not at the top so these receptors
are not on the top of the cell so how

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180
are not on the top of the cell so how
 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.979
are not on the top of the cell so how
does the virus infect the the mechanism

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989
does the virus infect the the mechanism
 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.750
does the virus infect the the mechanism
is very interesting and it's elucidated

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760
is very interesting and it's elucidated
 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.000
is very interesting and it's elucidated
by this experiment I just want to show

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010
by this experiment I just want to show
 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.339
by this experiment I just want to show
you this because it's very neat so these

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349
you this because it's very neat so these
 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.520
you this because it's very neat so these
are cells polarized cells which means

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530
are cells polarized cells which means
 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.110
are cells polarized cells which means
they have a top and a bottom growing in

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120
they have a top and a bottom growing in
 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.839
they have a top and a bottom growing in
a plastic dish and they've infected them

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849
a plastic dish and they've infected them
 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:26.390
a plastic dish and they've infected them
with coxsackievirus and then they're

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400
with coxsackievirus and then they're
 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.699
with coxsackievirus and then they're
using antibodies to look at where the

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709
using antibodies to look at where the
 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.030
using antibodies to look at where the
virus is and where car is and where DAF

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040
virus is and where car is and where DAF
 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.000
virus is and where car is and where DAF
is so the virus and the two receptors so

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010
is so the virus and the two receptors so
 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.939
is so the virus and the two receptors so
here on the left is is the virus so they

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:37.949
here on the left is is the virus so they
 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:40.039
here on the left is is the virus so they
bind the virus at low temperature so it

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049
bind the virus at low temperature so it
 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.170
bind the virus at low temperature so it
stays on the surface of the cell and if

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180
stays on the surface of the cell and if
 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.210
stays on the surface of the cell and if
you stain for the virus you see there's

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220
you stain for the virus you see there's
 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.089
you stain for the virus you see there's
green all over the top of the cell so

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099
green all over the top of the cell so
 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:48.680
green all over the top of the cell so
all the virus particles are bound all

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690
all the virus particles are bound all
 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.400
all the virus particles are bound all
over the top of the cell now what is it

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410
over the top of the cell now what is it
 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.430
over the top of the cell now what is it
binding to its binding to DAF so here on

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440
binding to its binding to DAF so here on
 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.500
binding to its binding to DAF so here on
the right is a staining for DAF which is

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510
the right is a staining for DAF which is
 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.439
the right is a staining for DAF which is
one of the two receptors for

00:03:59.439 --> 00:03:59.449
one of the two receptors for
 

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:02.569
one of the two receptors for
coxsackievirus so Coxsackie is binding

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579
coxsackievirus so Coxsackie is binding
 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.809
coxsackievirus so Coxsackie is binding
to the surface and it is binding to DAF

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819
to the surface and it is binding to DAF
 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:06.789
to the surface and it is binding to DAF
now when you raise the temperature

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799
now when you raise the temperature
 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:09.379
now when you raise the temperature
remember at 4 degrees viruses remain

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389
remember at 4 degrees viruses remain
 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:11.899
remember at 4 degrees viruses remain
bound to the surface when you raise the

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:11.909
bound to the surface when you raise the
 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:14.449
bound to the surface when you raise the
temperature you start the infection the

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459
temperature you start the infection the
 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.460
temperature you start the infection the
viruses start to move into the cell and

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470
viruses start to move into the cell and
 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.860
viruses start to move into the cell and
so what you see right away within 30

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870
so what you see right away within 30
 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.209
so what you see right away within 30
minutes the virus in green heater has

00:04:23.209 --> 00:04:23.219
minutes the virus in green heater has
 

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:25.310
minutes the virus in green heater has
all moved to the junctions between cells

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320
all moved to the junctions between cells
 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.580
all moved to the junctions between cells
so these are individuals

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590
so these are individuals
 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.030
so these are individuals
cells and that's where death is is as

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040
cells and that's where death is is as
 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.050
cells and that's where death is is as
well as I'm sorry

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060
well as I'm sorry
 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.920
well as I'm sorry
and and Daffy has also real oka lized in

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930
and and Daffy has also real oka lized in
 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.719
and and Daffy has also real oka lized in
these images as well so remember that

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729
these images as well so remember that
 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:39.210
these images as well so remember that
was originally spread out over the top

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220
was originally spread out over the top
 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.370
was originally spread out over the top
now it's real oka lysing to the

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380
now it's real oka lysing to the
 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.230
now it's real oka lysing to the
Junction's now if you keep going in the

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240
Junction's now if you keep going in the
 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.750
Junction's now if you keep going in the
infection the virus moves into the cell

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760
infection the virus moves into the cell
 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.400
infection the virus moves into the cell
now it's around the nucleus here the

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410
now it's around the nucleus here the
 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.290
now it's around the nucleus here the
nuclei here and it's beginning to

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300
nuclei here and it's beginning to
 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.850
nuclei here and it's beginning to
replicate and that's as far as we need

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860
replicate and that's as far as we need
 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.400
replicate and that's as far as we need
to take it there now if you look at car

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410
to take it there now if you look at car
 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.310
to take it there now if you look at car
to start with car is in red car is

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320
to start with car is in red car is
 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.050
to start with car is in red car is
always at the junctions remember this is

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060
always at the junctions remember this is
 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.000
always at the junctions remember this is
a protein stuck in the junctions between

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010
a protein stuck in the junctions between
 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.700
a protein stuck in the junctions between
cells it's not on the apical surface and

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710
cells it's not on the apical surface and
 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.580
cells it's not on the apical surface and
it stays there throughout infection and

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590
it stays there throughout infection and
 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.440
it stays there throughout infection and
you can see here we're staining just for

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450
you can see here we're staining just for
 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.870
you can see here we're staining just for
car and the cool thing here is that

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880
car and the cool thing here is that
 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.659
car and the cool thing here is that
eventually Daffy real oak eliza's to be

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669
eventually Daffy real oak eliza's to be
 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:15.810
eventually Daffy real oak eliza's to be
where car is and in this third column

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820
where car is and in this third column
 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.270
where car is and in this third column
here is the merge of the green and the

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280
here is the merge of the green and the
 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.430
here is the merge of the green and the
red colors you see it's yellow and that

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440
red colors you see it's yellow and that
 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.500
red colors you see it's yellow and that
just tells you that Daffy and car are

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510
just tells you that Daffy and car are
 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.750
just tells you that Daffy and car are
now in the same place on the south so

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760
now in the same place on the south so
 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.250
now in the same place on the south so
what seems to be happening here is the

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.260
what seems to be happening here is the
 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.950
what seems to be happening here is the
virus binds to Daffy Daffy free

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960
virus binds to Daffy Daffy free
 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.850
virus binds to Daffy Daffy free
localizes to where car is and then the

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860
localizes to where car is and then the
 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.219
localizes to where car is and then the
virus can bind also car to get into

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:35.229
virus can bind also car to get into
 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:37.830
virus can bind also car to get into
cells so that's for this virus that's

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840
cells so that's for this virus that's
 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.080
cells so that's for this virus that's
why it needs to receptors so let's show

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090
why it needs to receptors so let's show
 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.320
why it needs to receptors so let's show
that in a schematic so Coxsackie is

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330
that in a schematic so Coxsackie is
 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.529
that in a schematic so Coxsackie is
binding Daffy which is on the apical

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:46.539
binding Daffy which is on the apical
 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:47.879
binding Daffy which is on the apical
surface of the cell so this is an

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:47.889
surface of the cell so this is an
 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:50.339
surface of the cell so this is an
accessible receptor but apparently it's

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:50.349
accessible receptor but apparently it's
 

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:52.110
accessible receptor but apparently it's
not enough to get the virus into cells

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120
not enough to get the virus into cells
 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.240
not enough to get the virus into cells
otherwise the virus would enter at the

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250
otherwise the virus would enter at the
 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:54.920
otherwise the virus would enter at the
top

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930
top
 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.900
top
this virus requires car which is stuck

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:57.910
this virus requires car which is stuck
 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.520
this virus requires car which is stuck
in here in the tight junctions between

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530
in here in the tight junctions between
 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.390
in here in the tight junctions between
cells so the virus binds Daffy and it

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400
cells so the virus binds Daffy and it
 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.400
cells so the virus binds Daffy and it
moves to the junction and then

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:05.410
moves to the junction and then
 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.339
moves to the junction and then
eventually are now the neat thing in

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:08.349
eventually are now the neat thing in
 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:13.040
eventually are now the neat thing in
addition did you have a question yeah

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050
 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.829
yeah

00:06:16.829 --> 00:06:16.839
 

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:19.869
it seems to be staying on the surface

00:06:19.869 --> 00:06:19.879
it seems to be staying on the surface
 

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:22.719
it seems to be staying on the surface
but that movement requires some

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:22.729
but that movement requires some
 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:24.850
but that movement requires some
rearrangement of the act and

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:24.860
rearrangement of the act and
 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.980
rearrangement of the act and
microfilaments beneath the surface and

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:26.990
microfilaments beneath the surface and
 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.839
microfilaments beneath the surface and
so what happens here The Binding of the

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:28.849
so what happens here The Binding of the
 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:31.629
so what happens here The Binding of the
virus to DAF actually triggers a signal

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:31.639
virus to DAF actually triggers a signal
 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:35.679
virus to DAF actually triggers a signal
transduction Network and that loosens up

00:06:35.679 --> 00:06:35.689
transduction Network and that loosens up
 

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:37.510
transduction Network and that loosens up
the microfilaments so that the receptor

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520
the microfilaments so that the receptor
 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.390
the microfilaments so that the receptor
can move along to the tight junctions so

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400
can move along to the tight junctions so
 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.260
can move along to the tight junctions so
the binding to DAF not only allows it to

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.270
the binding to DAF not only allows it to
 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.209
the binding to DAF not only allows it to
move but it it loosens up the cell

00:06:46.209 --> 00:06:46.219
move but it it loosens up the cell
 

00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:48.790
move but it it loosens up the cell
surface so it can move okay so that's

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800
surface so it can move okay so that's
 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.619
surface so it can move okay so that's
just an example of why a virus would

00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:50.629
just an example of why a virus would
 

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:53.409
just an example of why a virus would
need to receptors because the entry

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:53.419
need to receptors because the entry
 

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:56.110
need to receptors because the entry
receptor which is this one car that's

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.120
receptor which is this one car that's
 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.829
receptor which is this one car that's
the one that endocytosis that's in the

00:06:59.829 --> 00:06:59.839
the one that endocytosis that's in the
 

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:02.200
the one that endocytosis that's in the
tight Junction so the virus binds to a

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:02.210
tight Junction so the virus binds to a
 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:03.670
tight Junction so the virus binds to a
different receptor on the surface moves

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:03.680
different receptor on the surface moves
 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.119
different receptor on the surface moves
to the car receptor and then gets in

00:07:06.119 --> 00:07:06.129
to the car receptor and then gets in
 

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:14.019
to the car receptor and then gets in
okay alright there is also another

00:07:14.019 --> 00:07:14.029
okay alright there is also another
 

00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:15.909
okay alright there is also another
example of entry that I wanted to tell

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:15.919
example of entry that I wanted to tell
 

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:18.579
example of entry that I wanted to tell
you about and this is for real viruses

00:07:18.579 --> 00:07:18.589
you about and this is for real viruses
 

00:07:18.589 --> 00:07:21.300
you about and this is for real viruses
these are these RNA viruses that have

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:21.310
these are these RNA viruses that have
 

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:24.909
these are these RNA viruses that have
two concentric icosahedron shells that

00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:24.919
two concentric icosahedron shells that
 

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:27.309
two concentric icosahedron shells that
make up the capsid so just think of an

00:07:27.309 --> 00:07:27.319
make up the capsid so just think of an
 

00:07:27.319 --> 00:07:28.989
make up the capsid so just think of an
icosahedral shout or two of them an

00:07:28.989 --> 00:07:28.999
icosahedral shout or two of them an
 

00:07:28.999 --> 00:07:32.110
icosahedral shout or two of them an
outer one and an inner one and this is

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:32.120
outer one and an inner one and this is
 

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.909
outer one and an inner one and this is
actually a virus we'll talk about today

00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:33.919
actually a virus we'll talk about today
 

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:36.969
actually a virus we'll talk about today
with respect to RNA synthesis this virus

00:07:36.969 --> 00:07:36.979
with respect to RNA synthesis this virus
 

00:07:36.979 --> 00:07:40.839
with respect to RNA synthesis this virus
is taken up by endocytosis standard

00:07:40.839 --> 00:07:40.849
is taken up by endocytosis standard
 

00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:43.920
is taken up by endocytosis standard
procedure we've talked about and this

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:43.930
procedure we've talked about and this
 

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.600
procedure we've talked about and this
that the endosome eventually fuse with

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:46.610
that the endosome eventually fuse with
 

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:48.369
that the endosome eventually fuse with
lysosomes and you know lysosomes are

00:07:48.369 --> 00:07:48.379
lysosomes and you know lysosomes are
 

00:07:48.379 --> 00:07:52.059
lysosomes and you know lysosomes are
full of protease ha's these protease is

00:07:52.059 --> 00:07:52.069
full of protease ha's these protease is
 

00:07:52.069 --> 00:07:54.420
full of protease ha's these protease is
in the lysosome take off the outer

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:54.430
in the lysosome take off the outer
 

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:57.779
in the lysosome take off the outer

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:47.840
nucleus here is cytoplasm would be up
 

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.870
nucleus here is cytoplasm would be up
here and there is a nuclear pore

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:49.880
here and there is a nuclear pore
 

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.810
here and there is a nuclear pore
adenoviruses partially disassembled it's

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:52.820
adenoviruses partially disassembled it's
 

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.150
adenoviruses partially disassembled it's
come out of the endosome it's moved to a

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:55.160
come out of the endosome it's moved to a
 

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.430
come out of the endosome it's moved to a
nuclear pore and now it's sitting on the

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:57.440
nuclear pore and now it's sitting on the
 

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.670
nuclear pore and now it's sitting on the
nuclear pore and in the nucleus as you

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:00.680
nuclear pore and in the nucleus as you
 

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:05.010
nuclear pore and in the nucleus as you
know there are histones these are these

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:05.020
know there are histones these are these
 

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:08.200
know there are histones these are these
oval shape proteins here and these

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:08.210
oval shape proteins here and these
 

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:10.330
oval shape proteins here and these
actually go through the pore out of the

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:10.340
actually go through the pore out of the
 

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:12.490
actually go through the pore out of the
pore and contact the capsid and they

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:12.500
pore and contact the capsid and they
 

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.980
pore and contact the capsid and they
bind to the exon protein which is one of

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:14.990
bind to the exon protein which is one of
 

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:17.170
bind to the exon protein which is one of
the capsid proteins and they start to

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:17.180
the capsid proteins and they start to
 

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.540
the capsid proteins and they start to
disassemble it and then they're imported

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:19.550
disassemble it and then they're imported
 

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:22.570
disassemble it and then they're imported
back into the nucleus the histones bound

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:22.580
back into the nucleus the histones bound
 

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.130
back into the nucleus the histones bound
to these capsid proteins and that

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:24.140
to these capsid proteins and that
 

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:26.620
to these capsid proteins and that
further disassembles the capsid so an

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:26.630
further disassembles the capsid so an
 

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:28.240
further disassembles the capsid so an
essential nuclear component of histone

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:28.250
essential nuclear component of histone
 

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:30.360
essential nuclear component of histone
actually participates in the disassembly

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:30.370
actually participates in the disassembly
 

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:33.340
actually participates in the disassembly
so here we showed capsid disassembly

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:33.350
so here we showed capsid disassembly
 

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:36.130
so here we showed capsid disassembly
mediated by the histone moving back in

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:36.140
mediated by the histone moving back in
 

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.170
mediated by the histone moving back in
and then finally the DNA is in the

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:38.180
and then finally the DNA is in the
 

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.420
and then finally the DNA is in the
capsid what's left of the capsid so this

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:40.430
capsid what's left of the capsid so this
 

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:43.210
capsid what's left of the capsid so this
the blue molecule with the orange dots

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:43.220
the blue molecule with the orange dots
 

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:46.540
the blue molecule with the orange dots
the orange dots is a viral protein

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:46.550
the orange dots is a viral protein
 

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:50.590
the orange dots is a viral protein
called protein 7 and that protein has a

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:50.600
called protein 7 and that protein has a
 

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.870
called protein 7 and that protein has a
nuclear localization signal on it and

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:52.880
nuclear localization signal on it and
 

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.160
nuclear localization signal on it and
that's what you need to get into the

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:54.170
that's what you need to get into the
 

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:55.870
that's what you need to get into the
nucleus using the important

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:55.880
nucleus using the important
 

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.700
nucleus using the important
scenery so that's how the DNA gets in

00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:57.710
scenery so that's how the DNA gets in
 

00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:00.340
scenery so that's how the DNA gets in
the import machinery binds these

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:00.350
the import machinery binds these
 

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:02.200
the import machinery binds these
proteins which are bound to DNA and

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:02.210
proteins which are bound to DNA and
 

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:04.900

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:25.360
to be able to make mRNA so we have to do
 

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.000
to be able to make mRNA so we have to do
two things with these RNA genomes we

two things with these RNA genomes we
 

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:28.470
two things with these RNA genomes we
have to replicate them completely and

positive strand genomes how they
 

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.050
positive strand genomes how they
replicate and how they make messenger

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:52.060
replicate and how they make messenger
 

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:55.230
replicate and how they make messenger

but they are so special that they get a
lecture all to themselves so we're not

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:04.240
lecture all to themselves so we're not
 

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.240
lecture all to themselves so we're not
going to talk about those today although

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:06.250
going to talk about those today although
 

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:08.550
going to talk about those today although
we'll mention them briefly so here is a

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:08.560
we'll mention them briefly so here is a
 

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:12.060
we'll mention them briefly so here is a
a seminal experiment done in I don't

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:12.070
a seminal experiment done in I don't
 

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:15.570
a seminal experiment done in I don't
know the early 60s which is using

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:15.580
know the early 60s which is using
 

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:17.940

technology that isn't really used
 

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:19.920
technology that isn't really used
anymore but what was done here this was

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:19.930
anymore but what was done here this was
 

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:21.840
anymore but what was done here this was
the first identification of an RNA

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:21.850
the first identification of an RNA
 

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:24.330

with poliovirus
 

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:31.020
with poliovirus
and what was done was to infect cells

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:31.030
and what was done was to infect cells
 

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:32.760
and what was done was to infect cells
with the virus and then at different

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:32.770
with the virus and then at different
 

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:34.920
with the virus and then at different
times after infection you can see ours

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:34.930

on the right plaque forming units per
 

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:45.270
on the right plaque forming units per
mil and that's the dotted line so this

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:45.280
mil and that's the dotted line so this
 

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.430
mil and that's the dotted line so this
is a wonderful one-step growth curve you

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440
is a wonderful one-step growth curve you
 

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.070
is a wonderful one-step growth curve you
can see the little eclipses period and

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:50.080
can see the little eclipses period and
 

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.380
can see the little eclipses period and
then production of virus eventually

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:52.390
then production of virus eventually
 

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:54.660
then production of virus eventually
plateauing and then on the left they're

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:54.670
plateauing and then on the left they're
 

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:58.560
plateauing and then on the left they're
measuring RNA polymerase activity and

00:16:58.560 --> 00:16:58.570
measuring RNA polymerase activity and
 

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:00.240
measuring RNA polymerase activity and
what they did in this experiment they

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:00.250
what they did in this experiment they
 

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:02.820
what they did in this experiment they
would at each time after infection take

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:02.830
would at each time after infection take
 

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:05.880
would at each time after infection take
the cells and crack them open with a

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:05.890
the cells and crack them open with a
 

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:09.630
the cells and crack them open with a
detergent and then add a nucleoside

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:09.640
detergent and then add a nucleoside
 

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:12.750
detergent and then add a nucleoside
triphosphate which had a label probably

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:12.760
triphosphate which had a label probably
 

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:17.490
triphosphate which had a label probably
I would guess 1960s it was probably

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:17.500
I would guess 1960s it was probably
 

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:20.010
I would guess 1960s it was probably
tritium or C 14 doesn't really matter

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:20.020
tritium or C 14 doesn't really matter
 

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:22.649
tritium or C 14 doesn't really matter
but it was a radioactive isotope

00:17:22.649 --> 00:17:22.659
but it was a radioactive isotope
 

00:17:22.659 --> 00:17:24.599
but it was a radioactive isotope
and then they would ask is there any of

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:24.609
and then they would ask is there any of
 

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:26.999
and then they would ask is there any of
that isotope incorporated into big RNA

00:17:26.999 --> 00:17:27.009
that isotope incorporated into big RNA
 

00:17:27.009 --> 00:17:30.389
that isotope incorporated into big RNA
molecules and you can see that in fact

00:17:30.389 --> 00:17:30.399
molecules and you can see that in fact
 

00:17:30.399 --> 00:17:32.009
molecules and you can see that in fact
starting at about two hours after

00:17:32.009 --> 00:17:32.019
starting at about two hours after
 

00:17:32.019 --> 00:17:34.769
starting at about two hours after
infection you do see big RNAs made in

00:17:34.769 --> 00:17:34.779
infection you do see big RNAs made in
 

00:17:34.779 --> 00:17:37.589
infection you do see big RNAs made in
the cell so this is the first example of

00:17:37.589 --> 00:17:37.599
the cell so this is the first example of
 

00:17:37.599 --> 00:17:42.239
the cell so this is the first example of
RNA polymerase activity in cells so

00:17:42.239 --> 00:17:42.249
RNA polymerase activity in cells so
 

00:17:42.249 --> 00:17:43.499
RNA polymerase activity in cells so
that's an experiment where you take a

00:17:43.499 --> 00:17:43.509
that's an experiment where you take a
 

00:17:43.509 --> 00:17:45.180
that's an experiment where you take a
cell extract and you incubate it with a

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:45.190
cell extract and you incubate it with a
 

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:49.080
cell extract and you incubate it with a
labeled precursor at NTP ATP UTP c TP or

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:49.090
labeled precursor at NTP ATP UTP c TP or
 

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:51.450
labeled precursor at NTP ATP UTP c TP or
GTP doesn't really matter and you

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:51.460
GTP doesn't really matter and you
 

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:53.190
GTP doesn't really matter and you
measure the incorporation into the k ik

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:53.200
measure the incorporation into the k ik
 

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.099
measure the incorporation into the k ik
acid what was also found very early on

00:17:56.099 --> 00:17:56.109
acid what was also found very early on
 

00:17:56.109 --> 00:17:58.649
acid what was also found very early on
was that this synthesis that we've just

00:17:58.649 --> 00:17:58.659
was that this synthesis that we've just
 

00:17:58.659 --> 00:18:01.830
was that this synthesis that we've just
measured with radioactivity is resistant

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:01.840
measured with radioactivity is resistant
 

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:06.359

extracted from fungi does anyone know

00:18:08.489 --> 00:18:08.499
extracted from fungi does anyone know
 

00:18:08.499 --> 00:18:14.599

what maxinemize indeed does it inhibits

00:18:14.599 --> 00:18:14.609
what maxinemize indeed does it inhibits
 

00:18:14.609 --> 00:18:19.889
what maxinemize indeed does it inhibits
DNA dependent RNA synthesis so in fact

00:18:19.889 --> 00:18:19.899
DNA dependent RNA synthesis so in fact
 

00:18:19.899 --> 00:18:23.099
DNA dependent RNA synthesis so in fact
if some of the early ideas were that

00:18:23.099 --> 00:18:23.109
if some of the early ideas were that
 

00:18:23.109 --> 00:18:26.339
if some of the early ideas were that
these viruses copied their RNA into DNA

00:18:26.339 --> 00:18:26.349
these viruses copied their RNA into DNA
 

00:18:26.349 --> 00:18:28.799
these viruses copied their RNA into DNA
and that was copied then from DNA back

00:18:28.799 --> 00:18:28.809
and that was copied then from DNA back
 

00:18:28.809 --> 00:18:30.419
and that was copied then from DNA back
to RNA because no one could understand

00:18:30.419 --> 00:18:30.429
to RNA because no one could understand
 

00:18:30.429 --> 00:18:32.909
to RNA because no one could understand
how RNA could be copied to RNA so it

00:18:32.909 --> 00:18:32.919
how RNA could be copied to RNA so it
 

00:18:32.919 --> 00:18:34.619
how RNA could be copied to RNA so it
found that this was in fact resistant to

00:18:34.619 --> 00:18:34.629
found that this was in fact resistant to
 

00:18:34.629 --> 00:18:36.239
found that this was in fact resistant to
that drug showing that it's not a DNA

00:18:36.239 --> 00:18:36.249
that drug showing that it's not a DNA
 

00:18:36.249 --> 00:18:39.419
that drug showing that it's not a DNA
RNA step involved in the synthesis so

00:18:39.419 --> 00:18:39.429
RNA step involved in the synthesis so
 

00:18:39.429 --> 00:18:41.430
RNA step involved in the synthesis so
these experiments were done with polio

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:41.440
these experiments were done with polio
 

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:43.379
these experiments were done with polio
viruses and related viruses there are

00:18:43.379 --> 00:18:43.389
viruses and related viruses there are
 

00:18:43.389 --> 00:18:45.539
viruses and related viruses there are
plus strand RNA viruses it was then the

00:18:45.539 --> 00:18:45.549
plus strand RNA viruses it was then the
 

00:18:45.549 --> 00:18:47.849
plus strand RNA viruses it was then the
same experiments were done with minus

00:18:47.849 --> 00:18:47.859
same experiments were done with minus
 

00:18:47.859 --> 00:18:50.399
same experiments were done with minus
strand viruses the difference here which

00:18:50.399 --> 00:18:50.409
strand viruses the difference here which
 

00:18:50.409 --> 00:18:52.769
strand viruses the difference here which
is really important is that for

00:18:52.769 --> 00:18:52.779
is really important is that for
 

00:18:52.779 --> 00:18:55.649
is really important is that for
poliovirus the polymerase is found only

00:18:55.649 --> 00:18:55.659
poliovirus the polymerase is found only
 

00:18:55.659 --> 00:18:59.249
poliovirus the polymerase is found only
in infected cells it's not in the virus

00:18:59.249 --> 00:18:59.259
in infected cells it's not in the virus
 

00:18:59.259 --> 00:19:02.089
in infected cells it's not in the virus
particle itself it's not in the virion

00:19:02.089 --> 00:19:02.099
particle itself it's not in the virion
 

00:19:02.099 --> 00:19:05.009
particle itself it's not in the virion
for negative strand viruses which were

00:19:05.009 --> 00:19:05.019
for negative strand viruses which were
 

00:19:05.019 --> 00:19:07.409
for negative strand viruses which were
then studied in the same way they could

00:19:07.409 --> 00:19:07.419
then studied in the same way they could
 

00:19:07.419 --> 00:19:09.180
then studied in the same way they could
find the polymerase and infected cells

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:09.190
find the polymerase and infected cells
 

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:10.710
find the polymerase and infected cells
but they could also find it in the

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:10.720
but they could also find it in the
 

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:11.749
but they could also find it in the
virion

00:19:11.749 --> 00:19:11.759
virion
 

00:19:11.759 --> 00:19:14.339
virion
and that's of course because the

00:19:14.339 --> 00:19:14.349
and that's of course because the
 

00:19:14.349 --> 00:19:16.289
and that's of course because the
negative strand virus is when that RNA

00:19:16.289 --> 00:19:16.299
negative strand virus is when that RNA
 

00:19:16.299 --> 00:19:18.149
negative strand virus is when that RNA
gets into the cell this nothing can be

00:19:18.149 --> 00:19:18.159
gets into the cell this nothing can be
 

00:19:18.159 --> 00:19:19.859
gets into the cell this nothing can be
done with it the cell can't translate it

00:19:19.859 --> 00:19:19.869
done with it the cell can't translate it
 

00:19:19.869 --> 00:19:22.200
done with it the cell can't translate it
because it's a negative strand so those

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:22.210
because it's a negative strand so those
 

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:24.839
because it's a negative strand so those
viruses have to bring in an enzyme into

00:19:24.839 --> 00:19:24.849
viruses have to bring in an enzyme into
 

00:19:24.849 --> 00:19:27.629
viruses have to bring in an enzyme into
the cell okay that's a really important

00:19:27.629 --> 00:19:27.639
the cell okay that's a really important
 

00:19:27.639 --> 00:19:29.539
the cell okay that's a really important
concept so you have to remember that

00:19:29.539 --> 00:19:29.549
concept so you have to remember that
 

00:19:29.549 --> 00:19:31.409
concept so you have to remember that
fundamental difference between plus and

00:19:31.409 --> 00:19:31.419
fundamental difference between plus and
 

00:19:31.419 --> 00:19:36.180
fundamental difference between plus and
minus strand viruses eventually over the

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:36.190
minus strand viruses eventually over the
 

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:36.630
minus strand viruses eventually over the
years

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:36.640
years
 

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.670

the template is read in a three to five
 

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:17.560
the template is read in a three to five
prime direction but the product is

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:17.570
prime direction but the product is
 

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:19.900

thumb domain a fingers domain and a palm
 

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:45.190
thumb domain a fingers domain and a palm
and the palm is typically the active

00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:45.200
and the palm is typically the active
 

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:48.640
and the palm is typically the active
site of the enzyme and here in the

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:48.650
site of the enzyme and here in the
 

00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:50.980
site of the enzyme and here in the
middle of this is the active site and in

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:50.990
middle of this is the active site and in
 

00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:53.260
middle of this is the active site and in
fact there these are two very important

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:53.270
fact there these are two very important
 

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:55.690
fact there these are two very important
side chains here that were involved in

00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:55.700
side chains here that were involved in
 

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:58.420
side chains here that were involved in
polymerization of nucleic acid so we're

00:29:58.420 --> 00:29:58.430
polymerization of nucleic acid so we're
 

00:29:58.430 --> 00:30:00.310
polymerization of nucleic acid so we're
not quite sure how the nucleic acid

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:00.320
not quite sure how the nucleic acid
 

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:01.900
not quite sure how the nucleic acid
moves in these but one model is that the

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:01.910
moves in these but one model is that the
 

00:30:01.910 --> 00:30:04.390
moves in these but one model is that the
template moves through the bottom here

00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:04.400
template moves through the bottom here
 

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.610
template moves through the bottom here
passes the active site where then the

00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:06.620
passes the active site where then the
 

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:08.170
passes the active site where then the
synthesis is done and then the product

00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:08.180
synthesis is done and then the product
 

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:10.930
synthesis is done and then the product
moves out of the top of the enzyme so

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:10.940
moves out of the top of the enzyme so
 

00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:12.490
moves out of the top of the enzyme so
the active site is here then everything

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:12.500
the active site is here then everything
 

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:14.560
the active site is here then everything
else is involved in template

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:14.570
else is involved in template
 

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:17.200
else is involved in template

of triphosphates this is an interesting

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:21.020

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:24.580
of triphosphates this is an interesting

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:30.040
polymerase and we're looking very close
in at the active site and this is

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:30.050
in at the active site and this is
 

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:32.680
in at the active site and this is
probably the interaction here's the

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:32.690
probably the interaction here's the
 

00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:34.300
probably the interaction here's the

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:40.460
here and this is a triphosphate you can
 

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:42.310
here and this is a triphosphate you can
see the three phosphates here that's

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:42.320
see the three phosphates here that's
 

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:43.990
see the three phosphates here that's
coming into the active site it's about

00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:44.000
coming into the active site it's about
 

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.690
coming into the active site it's about

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:46.700
to be added to the next to the next base
 

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:50.170
to be added to the next to the next base
in the growing chain and this base is an

00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:50.180
in the growing chain and this base is an
 

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:52.780
in the growing chain and this base is an
aspect to 38 you can see it's hydrogen

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:52.790

enzymes discriminate DNA from RNA so you

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:00.170
enzymes discriminate DNA from RNA so you
 

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:02.080

if this is an RNA polymerase you're

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:02.090
if this is an RNA polymerase you're
 

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:04.030
if this is an RNA polymerase you're
gonna copy an RNA template you only want

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:04.040
gonna copy an RNA template you only want
 

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:07.030

with this aspect 238 if a dntp moved in

00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:17.240
with this aspect 238 if a dntp moved in
 

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:19.180
with this aspect 238 if a dntp moved in
here it wouldn't form this base pair and

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:19.190
here it wouldn't form this base pair and
 

00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:21.250
here it wouldn't form this base pair and
it would be rejected so this is a very

the mRNA and the gene
 

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:50.290
the mRNA and the gene
are exactly the same thing so when you

00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:50.300
are exactly the same thing so when you
 

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:53.560
are exactly the same thing so when you
make a genome you're making mRNA the

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:53.570
make a genome you're making mRNA the
 

00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:55.360

that's as far as it has to go because

00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:22.400
that's as far as it has to go because
 

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.910
that's as far as it has to go because

be very stable so they're not degraded
 

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:02.880
be very stable so they're not degraded
in the cell and in fact there's so much

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:02.890
in the cell and in fact there's so much
 

00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:04.440
in the cell and in fact there's so much
of them made eventually that they

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:04.450
of them made eventually that they
 

00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:07.470
of them made eventually that they
overwhelm the cell and eventually the

00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:07.480
overwhelm the cell and eventually the
 

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:09.630
overwhelm the cell and eventually the
cell mRNAs are degraded because they're

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:09.640
cell mRNAs are degraded because they're
 

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.280
cell mRNAs are degraded because they're
not made anymore they have a certain

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:11.290
not made anymore they have a certain
 

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:13.440
not made anymore they have a certain
half-life the viruses shut off

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:13.450
half-life the viruses shut off
 

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:15.360
half-life the viruses shut off
transcription so there's no more

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:15.370
transcription so there's no more
 

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:23.760
transcription so there's no more
competition for translation yes why do

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:23.770
competition for translation yes why do
 

00:35:23.770 --> 00:35:26.630
competition for translation yes why do
it so why we need to make a minus strand

00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640
it so why we need to make a minus strand
 

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:30.420
it so why we need to make a minus strand
so it's said the way nucleic acid

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:30.430
so it's said the way nucleic acid
 

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:32.310
so it's said the way nucleic acid
replication works as you know the

00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:32.320
replication works as you know the
 

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:34.890
replication works as you know the
nucleic acids are series of bases and to

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:34.900
nucleic acids are series of bases and to
 

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:36.840
nucleic acids are series of bases and to
replicate it we have to make a

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:36.850
replicate it we have to make a
 

00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:39.450
replicate it we have to make a
complementary strand so wherever there's

00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:39.460
complementary strand so wherever there's
 

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:41.280
complementary strand so wherever there's
an A you have to make a strand with a T

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:41.290
an A you have to make a strand with a T
 

00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:43.410
an A you have to make a strand with a T
and then you make an A again so there's

00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:43.420
and then you make an A again so there's
 

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:45.510
and then you make an A again so there's
no other way to to duplicate that

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:45.520
no other way to to duplicate that
 

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:48.060
no other way to to duplicate that
nucleic acid without an intermediate so

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:48.070
nucleic acid without an intermediate so
 

00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:49.890
nucleic acid without an intermediate so
double-stranded DNA you remember each

00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:49.900
double-stranded DNA you remember each
 

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:54.870
double-stranded DNA you remember each
strand is copied to make new strands but

00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:54.880
strand is copied to make new strands but
 

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.730
strand is copied to make new strands but
here we only have one so we have to copy

00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:56.740
here we only have one so we have to copy
 

00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:58.800
here we only have one so we have to copy
it through an intermediate and that's

00:35:58.800 --> 00:35:58.810
it through an intermediate and that's
 

00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:00.210
it through an intermediate and that's
the only function for these negative

00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:00.220
the only function for these negative
 

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:08.780
the only function for these negative
strands just serve as templates

00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:08.790
 

00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:11.520
good question when it comes in the cell

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:11.530
good question when it comes in the cell
 

00:36:11.530 --> 00:36:14.280
good question when it comes in the cell
this plus strand RNA what is the first

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:14.290
this plus strand RNA what is the first
 

00:36:14.290 --> 00:36:16.170
this plus strand RNA what is the first
thing that happens does it get

00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:16.180
thing that happens does it get
 

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:20.720
thing that happens does it get
translated or you make a negative strand

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:20.730
 

00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:26.430
do you know the answer you could look at

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:26.440
do you know the answer you could look at
 

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:29.700
do you know the answer you could look at
this it's okay yeah you could translate

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:29.710
this it's okay yeah you could translate
 

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:33.120
this it's okay yeah you could translate
it and why is that why does the plus

00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:33.130
it and why is that why does the plus
 

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:35.190
it and why is that why does the plus
strand have to be translated and not

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:35.200
strand have to be translated and not
 

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:42.900
strand have to be translated and not
replicated do you know anybody do you

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:42.910
replicated do you know anybody do you
 

00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:44.820
replicated do you know anybody do you
need the RNA polymerase because there's

00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:44.830
need the RNA polymerase because there's
 

00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:46.920
need the RNA polymerase because there's
no way this RNA can be copied by the

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:46.930
no way this RNA can be copied by the
 

00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:50.160
no way this RNA can be copied by the
cell really important concept you put a

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:50.170
cell really important concept you put a
 

00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:52.440
cell really important concept you put a
plus strand viral RNA in the cell can't

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:52.450
plus strand viral RNA in the cell can't
 

00:36:52.450 --> 00:36:54.540
plus strand viral RNA in the cell can't
be copied so it has to be translated

00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:54.550
be copied so it has to be translated
 

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:57.350
be copied so it has to be translated
first you can so if you just know that

00:36:57.350 --> 00:36:57.360
first you can so if you just know that
 

00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:00.330
first you can so if you just know that
cells can't copy aren't viral RNAs you

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:00.340
cells can't copy aren't viral RNAs you
 

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:02.310
cells can't copy aren't viral RNAs you
can figure out what happens when a plus

00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:02.320
can figure out what happens when a plus
 

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:04.730
can figure out what happens when a plus
or minus strand RNA comes into a cell

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:04.740
or minus strand RNA comes into a cell
 

00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:07.020
or minus strand RNA comes into a cell
because we'll see with a negative strand

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:07.030
because we'll see with a negative strand
 

00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:10.110
because we'll see with a negative strand
RNA has to be copied first therefore it

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:10.120
RNA has to be copied first therefore it
 

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:12.330
RNA has to be copied first therefore it
has to bring in a polymerase with it

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:12.340
has to bring in a polymerase with it
 

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:17.340
has to bring in a polymerase with it
okay so here's the polio genome it's a

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:17.350
okay so here's the polio genome it's a
 

00:37:17.350 --> 00:37:20.250
okay so here's the polio genome it's a
plus strand RNA comes in the cell it is

00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:20.260
plus strand RNA comes in the cell it is
 

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:23.190
plus strand RNA comes in the cell it is
immediately translated and you get a

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.200
immediately translated and you get a
 

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:25.470
immediately translated and you get a
what is called a poly protein this is

00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:25.480
what is called a poly protein this is
 

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:27.720
what is called a poly protein this is
one way of making a lot of proteins from

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:27.730
one way of making a lot of proteins from
 

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:30.600
one way of making a lot of proteins from
a single message now in eukaryotic cells

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:30.610
a single message now in eukaryotic cells
 

00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:35.310
a single message now in eukaryotic cells
one messenger RNA one protein so viruses

00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:35.320
one messenger RNA one protein so viruses
 

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:37.140
one messenger RNA one protein so viruses
have to get around that limitation in

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:37.150
have to get around that limitation in
 

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:38.790
have to get around that limitation in
bacteria that's not the issue you can

00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:38.800
bacteria that's not the issue you can
 

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.760
bacteria that's not the issue you can
make one mRNA can make several proteins

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:41.770
make one mRNA can make several proteins
 

00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:43.560
make one mRNA can make several proteins
but not in mammalian cells for the most

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:43.570
but not in mammalian cells for the most
 

00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:45.720
but not in mammalian cells for the most
part so how does polio get around that

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:45.730
part so how does polio get around that
 

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:48.150
part so how does polio get around that
and the pakoras and the flavie's they

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:48.160
and the pakoras and the flavie's they
 

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:50.430
and the pakoras and the flavie's they
make a long protein and it's chopped up

00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:50.440
make a long protein and it's chopped up
 

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:53.460
make a long protein and it's chopped up
by proteases that are embedded in the

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:53.470
by proteases that are embedded in the
 

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:55.950
by proteases that are embedded in the
sequence so they can make 12 proteins

00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:55.960
sequence so they can make 12 proteins
 

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:58.680
sequence so they can make 12 proteins
from one and from one precursor in one

00:37:58.680 --> 00:37:58.690
from one and from one precursor in one
 

00:37:58.690 --> 00:38:01.770
from one and from one precursor in one
mRNA all right so the RNA polymerase

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:01.780
mRNA all right so the RNA polymerase
 

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:03.780
mRNA all right so the RNA polymerase
that is copying these genomes is

00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:03.790
that is copying these genomes is
 

00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:05.010
that is copying these genomes is
translated down here

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:05.020
translated down here
 

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:11.040
translated down here
it's called 3d PAH okay now the RNA has

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:11.050
it's called 3d PAH okay now the RNA has
 

00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:13.200
it's called 3d PAH okay now the RNA has
sequences or structures in it that are

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:13.210
sequences or structures in it that are
 

00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:16.110
sequences or structures in it that are
signals for RNA replication and here's

00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:16.120
signals for RNA replication and here's
 

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:18.000
signals for RNA replication and here's
the RNA genome presented in a slightly

the RNA genome presented in a slightly
 

00:38:18.010 --> 00:38:19.770
the RNA genome presented in a slightly
different way we have at the five prime

00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:19.780
different way we have at the five prime
 

00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:21.130
different way we have at the five prime
end a clove

00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:21.140
end a clove
 

00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:23.380
end a clove
we have in the middle of stem-loop and

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:23.390
we have in the middle of stem-loop and
 

00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:25.929
we have in the middle of stem-loop and
at the 3-prime end a pseudo na and these

00:38:25.929 --> 00:38:25.939
at the 3-prime end a pseudo na and these
 

00:38:25.939 --> 00:38:28.359
at the 3-prime end a pseudo na and these
are all important signals for RNA

00:38:28.359 --> 00:38:28.369
are all important signals for RNA
 

00:38:28.369 --> 00:38:32.499
are all important signals for RNA
replication now think when when polio

00:38:32.499 --> 00:38:32.509
replication now think when when polio
 

00:38:32.509 --> 00:38:36.370
replication now think when when polio
infects a cell and the the polymerase is

00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:36.380
infects a cell and the the polymerase is
 

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:38.499
infects a cell and the the polymerase is
made and it replicates the genome it

00:38:38.499 --> 00:38:38.509
made and it replicates the genome it
 

00:38:38.509 --> 00:38:42.279
made and it replicates the genome it
only copies viral RNAs it never copies

00:38:42.279 --> 00:38:42.289
only copies viral RNAs it never copies
 

00:38:42.289 --> 00:38:46.059
only copies viral RNAs it never copies
cellular mRNAs even though cellular RNAs

00:38:46.059 --> 00:38:46.069
cellular mRNAs even though cellular RNAs
 

00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:47.620
cellular mRNAs even though cellular RNAs
look pretty much like this they have

00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:47.630
look pretty much like this they have
 

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:50.769
look pretty much like this they have
their RNA and they have a poly a

00:38:50.769 --> 00:38:50.779
their RNA and they have a poly a
 

00:38:50.779 --> 00:38:53.019
their RNA and they have a poly a
sequence at the three prime end so why

00:38:53.019 --> 00:38:53.029
sequence at the three prime end so why
 

00:38:53.029 --> 00:38:54.699
sequence at the three prime end so why
wouldn't they be copied by the viral

00:38:54.699 --> 00:38:54.709
wouldn't they be copied by the viral
 

00:38:54.709 --> 00:38:56.380
wouldn't they be copied by the viral
polymerase well in fact it's because of

00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:56.390
polymerase well in fact it's because of
 

00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:59.169
polymerase well in fact it's because of
these kinds of structures that say copy

00:38:59.169 --> 00:38:59.179
these kinds of structures that say copy
 

00:38:59.179 --> 00:39:01.390
these kinds of structures that say copy
only this RNA and these aren't present

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:01.400
only this RNA and these aren't present
 

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:02.979
only this RNA and these aren't present
in messenger RNA so they don't get

00:39:02.979 --> 00:39:02.989
in messenger RNA so they don't get
 

00:39:02.989 --> 00:39:05.409
in messenger RNA so they don't get
copied I'm going to show you why these

00:39:05.409 --> 00:39:05.419
copied I'm going to show you why these
 

00:39:05.419 --> 00:39:09.489
copied I'm going to show you why these
confer specificity right now now at the

00:39:09.489 --> 00:39:09.499
confer specificity right now now at the
 

00:39:09.499 --> 00:39:13.059
confer specificity right now now at the
five prime end of the viral RNA shown

00:39:13.059 --> 00:39:13.069
five prime end of the viral RNA shown

here it is again in this slide and it is

00:39:25.989 --> 00:39:25.999
here it is again in this slide and it is
 

00:39:25.999 --> 00:39:28.359
here it is again in this slide and it is
covalently linked to the first base of

00:39:28.359 --> 00:39:28.369
covalently linked to the first base of
 

00:39:28.369 --> 00:39:32.249
covalently linked to the first base of
the genome of polio so here is the first

00:39:32.249 --> 00:39:32.259
the genome of polio so here is the first
 

00:39:32.259 --> 00:39:34.899
the genome of polio so here is the first
nucleotides of polio RNA they fold into

00:39:34.899 --> 00:39:34.909
nucleotides of polio RNA they fold into
 

00:39:34.909 --> 00:39:37.959

a cloverleaf and the first base is au

00:39:37.959 --> 00:39:37.969
a cloverleaf and the first base is au
 

00:39:37.969 --> 00:39:40.449
a cloverleaf and the first base is au
and that is linked via this

00:39:40.449 --> 00:39:40.459
and that is linked via this
 

00:39:40.459 --> 00:39:45.159
and that is linked via this
phosphodiester bond to a tyrosine on vpg

00:39:45.159 --> 00:39:45.169
phosphodiester bond to a tyrosine on vpg
 

00:39:45.169 --> 00:39:48.539
phosphodiester bond to a tyrosine on vpg
so this is a covalent likud linkage and

00:39:48.539 --> 00:39:48.549
so this is a covalent likud linkage and
 

00:39:48.549 --> 00:39:50.679
so this is a covalent likud linkage and
this is actually this protein is

00:39:50.679 --> 00:39:50.689
this is actually this protein is
 

00:39:50.689 --> 00:39:52.659
this is actually this protein is
actually removed that some part of the

00:39:52.659 --> 00:39:52.669
actually removed that some part of the
 

00:39:52.669 --> 00:39:54.519
actually removed that some part of the
infectious cycle which we don't have to

00:39:54.519 --> 00:39:54.529
infectious cycle which we don't have to
 

00:39:54.529 --> 00:39:56.289
infectious cycle which we don't have to
worry about and that's what that arrow

00:39:56.289 --> 00:39:56.299
worry about and that's what that arrow
 

00:39:56.299 --> 00:39:58.359
worry about and that's what that arrow
means this protein is actually the

00:39:58.359 --> 00:39:58.369
means this protein is actually the
 

00:39:58.369 --> 00:40:01.569
means this protein is actually the
primer for RNA replication so polio RNA

00:40:01.569 --> 00:40:01.579
primer for RNA replication so polio RNA
 

00:40:01.579 --> 00:40:03.759
primer for RNA replication so polio RNA
polymerase is a primer dependent enzyme

00:40:03.759 --> 00:40:03.769
polymerase is a primer dependent enzyme
 

00:40:03.769 --> 00:40:07.269
polymerase is a primer dependent enzyme
it can't initiate synthesis de novo and

00:40:07.269 --> 00:40:07.279
it can't initiate synthesis de novo and
 

00:40:07.279 --> 00:40:10.179
it can't initiate synthesis de novo and
the primer is actually this protein

00:40:10.179 --> 00:40:10.189
the primer is actually this protein
 

00:40:10.189 --> 00:40:13.689
the primer is actually this protein
linked to two nucleotides are two bases

00:40:13.689 --> 00:40:13.699
linked to two nucleotides are two bases
 

00:40:13.699 --> 00:40:17.499
linked to two nucleotides are two bases
which we will see so the primer is made

00:40:17.499 --> 00:40:17.509
which we will see so the primer is made
 

00:40:17.509 --> 00:40:21.339
which we will see so the primer is made
actually before RNA synthesis can begin

00:40:21.339 --> 00:40:21.349
actually before RNA synthesis can begin
 

00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:24.099
actually before RNA synthesis can begin
and the important signal in the genome

00:40:24.099 --> 00:40:24.109
and the important signal in the genome
 

00:40:24.109 --> 00:40:27.789
and the important signal in the genome
is this stem loop called cree which i

00:40:27.789 --> 00:40:27.799
is this stem loop called cree which i
 

00:40:27.799 --> 00:40:29.880
is this stem loop called cree which i
showed you on this previous slide isn't

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:29.890
showed you on this previous slide isn't
 

00:40:29.890 --> 00:40:31.809
showed you on this previous slide isn't
that somewhere in the middle of the

00:40:31.809 --> 00:40:31.819
that somewhere in the middle of the
 

00:40:31.819 --> 00:40:33.039
that somewhere in the middle of the
genome it actually is in different

00:40:33.039 --> 00:40:33.049
genome it actually is in different
 

00:40:33.049 --> 00:40:34.210
genome it actually is in different
places in different book

00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:34.220
places in different book
 

00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:36.340
places in different book
of viruses that doesn't matter too much

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:36.350
of viruses that doesn't matter too much
 

00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:38.680
of viruses that doesn't matter too much
the point is this is where the primer is

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:38.690
the point is this is where the primer is
 

00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:41.410
the point is this is where the primer is
initially synthesized so what happens is

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:41.420
initially synthesized so what happens is
 

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:45.640
initially synthesized so what happens is
the RNA polymerase shown here binds as a

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:45.650
the RNA polymerase shown here binds as a
 

00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:49.180
the RNA polymerase shown here binds as a
dimer to this Kree v PG comes along and

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:49.190
dimer to this Kree v PG comes along and
 

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:52.120
dimer to this Kree v PG comes along and
then the RNA polymerase actually copies

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:52.130
then the RNA polymerase actually copies
 

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:54.880
then the RNA polymerase actually copies
but to a residues which are in the loop

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:54.890
but to a residues which are in the loop
 

00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:57.010
but to a residues which are in the loop
of this Kree sequence and that allows it

00:40:57.010 --> 00:40:57.020
of this Kree sequence and that allows it
 

00:40:57.020 --> 00:41:00.340
of this Kree sequence and that allows it
to put to use on to this V PG so this is

00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:00.350
to put to use on to this V PG so this is
 

00:41:00.350 --> 00:41:02.890
to put to use on to this V PG so this is
basically how this primer is synthesized

00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:02.900
basically how this primer is synthesized
 

00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:06.100
basically how this primer is synthesized
by the polymerase by taking v PG which

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:06.110
by the polymerase by taking v PG which
 

00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:08.080
by the polymerase by taking v PG which
has already been made so far in viral

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:08.090
has already been made so far in viral
 

00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:10.600
has already been made so far in viral
infection and then linking to use on to

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:10.610
infection and then linking to use on to
 

00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:13.930
infection and then linking to use on to
it the user templated by this Kree loop

00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:13.940
it the user templated by this Kree loop
 

00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:16.120
it the user templated by this Kree loop
at the top here very interesting use of

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:16.130
at the top here very interesting use of
 

00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:19.450
at the top here very interesting use of
a stem loop now somehow this primer has

00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:19.460
a stem loop now somehow this primer has
 

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:21.040
a stem loop now somehow this primer has
to get to the three prime end of the

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:21.050
to get to the three prime end of the
 

00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:24.610
to get to the three prime end of the
mRNA of the genome remember initiation

00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:24.620
mRNA of the genome remember initiation
 

00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:26.800
mRNA of the genome remember initiation
goes from the three prime end and

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:26.810
goes from the three prime end and
 

00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:29.470
goes from the three prime end and
synthesis in a 5 to 3 prime direction so

00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:29.480
synthesis in a 5 to 3 prime direction so
 

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:31.150
synthesis in a 5 to 3 prime direction so
this primer has to get to the 3 prime

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:31.160
this primer has to get to the 3 prime
 

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:33.460
this primer has to get to the 3 prime
and yet the Kree sequences are in the

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:33.470
and yet the Kree sequences are in the
 

00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:34.870
and yet the Kree sequences are in the
middle of the genome so this is the

00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:34.880
middle of the genome so this is the
 

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:38.560
middle of the genome so this is the
conundrum that has to be solved and we

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:38.570
conundrum that has to be solved and we
 

00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:41.530
conundrum that has to be solved and we
think it's solved by circular izing the

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:41.540
think it's solved by circular izing the
 

00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:46.540
think it's solved by circular izing the
RNA this is a hypothetical model for RNA

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:46.550
RNA this is a hypothetical model for RNA
 

00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:48.070
RNA this is a hypothetical model for RNA
replication which has some very

00:41:48.070 --> 00:41:48.080
replication which has some very
 

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:50.260
replication which has some very
interesting elements and the idea is

00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:50.270
interesting elements and the idea is
 

00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:52.570
interesting elements and the idea is
that the RNA replication complex which

00:41:52.570 --> 00:41:52.580
that the RNA replication complex which
 

00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:54.850
that the RNA replication complex which
is shown at the top is membrane bound

00:41:54.850 --> 00:41:54.860
is shown at the top is membrane bound
 

00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:56.590
is shown at the top is membrane bound
remember it occurs on the surface of

00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:56.600
remember it occurs on the surface of
 

00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:00.220
remember it occurs on the surface of
those vesicles it's held in place to the

00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:00.230
those vesicles it's held in place to the
 

00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:02.200
those vesicles it's held in place to the
membrane by a membrane protein of the

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:02.210
membrane by a membrane protein of the
 

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:04.540
membrane by a membrane protein of the
viral protein called 3 a B which

00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:04.550
viral protein called 3 a B which
 

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:07.510
viral protein called 3 a B which
interacts with a cellular protein that

00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:07.520
interacts with a cellular protein that
 

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:09.790
interacts with a cellular protein that
in turn is binding this cloverleaf and

00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:09.800
in turn is binding this cloverleaf and
 

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:12.850
in turn is binding this cloverleaf and
that is what attaches the RNA complex to

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:12.860
that is what attaches the RNA complex to
 

00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:15.280
that is what attaches the RNA complex to
the membrane this is the viral RNA the

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:15.290
the membrane this is the viral RNA the
 

00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:18.640
the membrane this is the viral RNA the
cloverleaf is at the 5 prime end and the

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:18.650
cloverleaf is at the 5 prime end and the
 

00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:20.350
cloverleaf is at the 5 prime end and the
here is the 3 prime end of the genome

00:42:20.350 --> 00:42:20.360
here is the 3 prime end of the genome
 

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:22.030
here is the 3 prime end of the genome
and there of course there is a poly a

00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:22.040
and there of course there is a poly a
 

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:24.010
and there of course there is a poly a
sequence this is a messenger RNA of

00:42:24.010 --> 00:42:24.020
sequence this is a messenger RNA of
 

00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:26.710
sequence this is a messenger RNA of
course as well as a viral RNA and this

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720
course as well as a viral RNA and this
 

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:29.200
course as well as a viral RNA and this
RNA becomes circularized or maybe I

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:29.210
RNA becomes circularized or maybe I
 

00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:30.880
RNA becomes circularized or maybe I
should say the ends are brought together

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:30.890
should say the ends are brought together
 

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:34.000
should say the ends are brought together
because the poly a sequence is bound by

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:34.010
because the poly a sequence is bound by
 

00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:35.920
because the poly a sequence is bound by
a cell protein called poly a binding

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:35.930
a cell protein called poly a binding
 

00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:40.300
a cell protein called poly a binding
protein P ABP which in turn will bind

00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:40.310
protein P ABP which in turn will bind
 

00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:42.880
protein P ABP which in turn will bind
the cloverleaf and all the proteins that

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:42.890
the cloverleaf and all the proteins that
 

00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:45.280
the cloverleaf and all the proteins that
are associated with it so we have the 5

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:45.290
are associated with it so we have the 5
 

00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:47.430
are associated with it so we have the 5
and the 3 prime ends of the R

00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:47.440
and the 3 prime ends of the R
 

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:49.710
and the 3 prime ends of the R
are brought together and that that's how

00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:49.720
are brought together and that that's how
 

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:53.010
are brought together and that that's how
initiation begins because here at the

00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:53.020
initiation begins because here at the
 

00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:55.290
initiation begins because here at the
5-prime end is the RNA polymerase and

00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:55.300
5-prime end is the RNA polymerase and
 

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:56.910
5-prime end is the RNA polymerase and
once the three prime end is brought to

00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:56.920
once the three prime end is brought to
 

00:42:56.920 --> 00:43:00.120
once the three prime end is brought to
it it can start copying that RNA and

00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:00.130
it it can start copying that RNA and
 

00:43:00.130 --> 00:43:03.210
it it can start copying that RNA and
making a negative strand and it uses the

00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:03.220
making a negative strand and it uses the
 

00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:06.329
making a negative strand and it uses the
primer we don't know how this v PG pu pu

00:43:06.329 --> 00:43:06.339
primer we don't know how this v PG pu pu
 

00:43:06.339 --> 00:43:08.670
primer we don't know how this v PG pu pu
gets over here to initiate priming but

00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:08.680
gets over here to initiate priming but
 

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:10.020
gets over here to initiate priming but
somehow it does you can see there's a

00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:10.030
somehow it does you can see there's a
 

00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:13.500
somehow it does you can see there's a
magical leap from here to here and then

00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:13.510
magical leap from here to here and then
 

00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:15.720
magical leap from here to here and then
that initiates synthesis on the three

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:15.730
that initiates synthesis on the three
 

00:43:15.730 --> 00:43:17.700
that initiates synthesis on the three
prime end and then you get elongation

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:17.710
prime end and then you get elongation
 

00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:19.050
prime end and then you get elongation
and eventually the synthesis of a

00:43:19.050 --> 00:43:19.060
and eventually the synthesis of a
 

00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:20.339
and eventually the synthesis of a
negative strand so here's our original

00:43:20.339 --> 00:43:20.349
negative strand so here's our original
 

00:43:20.349 --> 00:43:23.069
negative strand so here's our original
plus strand and now we have the negative

00:43:23.069 --> 00:43:23.079
plus strand and now we have the negative
 

00:43:23.079 --> 00:43:24.690
plus strand and now we have the negative
strand and then of course it's copied

00:43:24.690 --> 00:43:24.700
strand and then of course it's copied
 

00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:27.329
strand and then of course it's copied
the negative strand is copied again by a

00:43:27.329 --> 00:43:27.339
the negative strand is copied again by a
 

00:43:27.339 --> 00:43:29.099
the negative strand is copied again by a
similar mechanism to make more plus

00:43:29.099 --> 00:43:29.109
similar mechanism to make more plus
 

00:43:29.109 --> 00:43:31.609
similar mechanism to make more plus
strands so these are very unusual

00:43:31.609 --> 00:43:31.619
strands so these are very unusual
 

00:43:31.619 --> 00:43:35.819
strands so these are very unusual
mechanisms that are be lying the

00:43:35.819 --> 00:43:35.829
mechanisms that are be lying the
 

00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:37.829
mechanisms that are be lying the
simplicity of this kind of scheme here

00:43:37.829 --> 00:43:37.839
simplicity of this kind of scheme here
 

00:43:37.839 --> 00:43:41.160
simplicity of this kind of scheme here
plus minus plus now on the right is the

00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:41.170
plus minus plus now on the right is the
 

00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:43.140
plus minus plus now on the right is the
scheme for alpha viruses these are also

00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:43.150
scheme for alpha viruses these are also
 

00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:44.670
scheme for alpha viruses these are also
plus strand viruses but they do

00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:44.680
plus strand viruses but they do
 

00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:46.380
plus strand viruses but they do
something different they have a plus

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:46.390
something different they have a plus
 

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:50.040
something different they have a plus
strand RNA and so when they come in the

00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:50.050
strand RNA and so when they come in the
 

00:43:50.050 --> 00:43:51.809
strand RNA and so when they come in the
cell the first thing that happens is

00:43:51.809 --> 00:43:51.819
cell the first thing that happens is
 

00:43:51.819 --> 00:43:54.870
cell the first thing that happens is
that they are translated and you make a

00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:54.880
that they are translated and you make a
 

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:58.290
that they are translated and you make a
negative strand compliment to make more

00:43:58.290 --> 00:43:58.300
negative strand compliment to make more
 

00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:01.260
negative strand compliment to make more
genomes but there is also the production

00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:01.270
genomes but there is also the production
 

00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:04.680
genomes but there is also the production
of a small mRNA in the life cycle of

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:04.690
of a small mRNA in the life cycle of
 

00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:08.040
of a small mRNA in the life cycle of
these viruses that RNA is made from this

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:08.050
these viruses that RNA is made from this
 

00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:10.710
these viruses that RNA is made from this
negative strand intermediate we don't

00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:10.720
negative strand intermediate we don't
 

00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:12.900
negative strand intermediate we don't
know why this has to be done this way it

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:12.910
know why this has to be done this way it
 

00:44:12.910 --> 00:44:15.240
know why this has to be done this way it
works and it's evolved to be this way

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:15.250
works and it's evolved to be this way
 

00:44:15.250 --> 00:44:17.910
works and it's evolved to be this way
this virus could just as easily have a

00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:17.920
this virus could just as easily have a
 

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:20.910
this virus could just as easily have a
scheme like this but it doesn't it

00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:20.920
scheme like this but it doesn't it
 

00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:23.790
scheme like this but it doesn't it
translates part of this plus strand and

00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:23.800
translates part of this plus strand and
 

00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:25.770
translates part of this plus strand and
it doesn't translate the rest and the

00:44:25.770 --> 00:44:25.780
it doesn't translate the rest and the
 

00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:27.510
it doesn't translate the rest and the
rest of it has to be accessed by what we

00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:27.520
rest of it has to be accessed by what we
 

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:31.740
rest of it has to be accessed by what we
call a sub genomic mRNA so this is the

00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:31.750
call a sub genomic mRNA so this is the
 

00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:33.839
call a sub genomic mRNA so this is the
life cycle for these viruses we've

00:44:33.839 --> 00:44:33.849
life cycle for these viruses we've
 

00:44:33.849 --> 00:44:35.490
life cycle for these viruses we've
talked about how some of these viruses

00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:35.500
talked about how some of these viruses
 

00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:38.510
talked about how some of these viruses
enter cells before through endocytosis

00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:38.520
enter cells before through endocytosis
 

00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:41.730
enter cells before through endocytosis
so basically this recapitulates what

00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:41.740
so basically this recapitulates what
 

00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:43.620
so basically this recapitulates what
I've told you the viral RNA gets put

00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:43.630
I've told you the viral RNA gets put
 

00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:46.829
I've told you the viral RNA gets put
into the cytoplasm the first half of it

00:44:46.829 --> 00:44:46.839
into the cytoplasm the first half of it
 

00:44:46.839 --> 00:44:49.109
into the cytoplasm the first half of it
is translated and the protein that is

00:44:49.109 --> 00:44:49.119
is translated and the protein that is
 

00:44:49.119 --> 00:44:50.370
is translated and the protein that is
made is actually the viral RNA

00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:50.380
made is actually the viral RNA
 

00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:52.109
made is actually the viral RNA
polymerase that makes perfect sense

00:44:52.109 --> 00:44:52.119
polymerase that makes perfect sense
 

00:44:52.119 --> 00:44:54.420
polymerase that makes perfect sense
because that then goes on and copies

00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:54.430
because that then goes on and copies
 

00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:56.490
because that then goes on and copies
that input RNA it makes full-length

00:44:56.490 --> 00:44:56.500
that input RNA it makes full-length
 

00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:58.500
that input RNA it makes full-length
negative strands and more plus strands

00:44:58.500 --> 00:44:58.510
negative strands and more plus strands
 

00:44:58.510 --> 00:45:00.630
negative strands and more plus strands
but it also

00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:00.640
but it also
 

00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:03.540
but it also
these negative strands and makes a small

00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:03.550
these negative strands and makes a small
 

00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:06.410
these negative strands and makes a small
mRNA the sub genomic mRNA so that the

00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:06.420
mRNA the sub genomic mRNA so that the
 

00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:08.850
mRNA the sub genomic mRNA so that the
second half of the genome can be

00:45:08.850 --> 00:45:08.860
second half of the genome can be
 

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:11.220
second half of the genome can be
accessed because this translation step

00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:11.230
accessed because this translation step
 

00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:12.990
accessed because this translation step
here is only translating the first half

00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:13.000
here is only translating the first half
 

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.870
here is only translating the first half
of the genome by making this sub genomic

00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:15.880
of the genome by making this sub genomic
 

00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:17.760
of the genome by making this sub genomic
mRNA you get the second half produced

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:17.770
mRNA you get the second half produced
 

00:45:17.770 --> 00:45:20.070
mRNA you get the second half produced
and eventually all the proteins made go

00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:20.080
and eventually all the proteins made go
 

00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:22.470
and eventually all the proteins made go
for the production of new virus

00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:22.480
for the production of new virus
 

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:26.120
for the production of new virus
particles so it's just a twist on

00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:26.130
particles so it's just a twist on
 

00:45:26.130 --> 00:45:29.160
particles so it's just a twist on
getting your information in your genome

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:29.170
getting your information in your genome
 

00:45:29.170 --> 00:45:31.590
getting your information in your genome
decoded and again the problem is if you

00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:31.600
decoded and again the problem is if you
 

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:35.010
decoded and again the problem is if you
have only one mRNA you can either make a

00:45:35.010 --> 00:45:35.020
have only one mRNA you can either make a
 

00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:37.830
have only one mRNA you can either make a
poly protein or maybe you can make small

00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:37.840
poly protein or maybe you can make small
 

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:39.840
poly protein or maybe you can make small
RNAs from it so this virus takes both

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:39.850
RNAs from it so this virus takes both
 

00:45:39.850 --> 00:45:41.940
RNAs from it so this virus takes both
strategies it makes a poly protein here

00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:41.950
strategies it makes a poly protein here
 

00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:44.370
strategies it makes a poly protein here
but it also makes a small sub genomic

00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:44.380
but it also makes a small sub genomic
 

00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:46.770
but it also makes a small sub genomic
RNA so here is an example where that

00:45:46.770 --> 00:45:46.780
RNA so here is an example where that
 

00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:48.780
RNA so here is an example where that
negative strand has some function it

00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:48.790
negative strand has some function it
 

00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:51.030
negative strand has some function it
serves as a template for making these

00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:51.040
serves as a template for making these
 

00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:55.260
serves as a template for making these
mRNAs here and here's another view of

00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:55.270
mRNAs here and here's another view of
 

00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:57.540
mRNAs here and here's another view of
the same process just to make it clear

00:45:57.540 --> 00:45:57.550
the same process just to make it clear
 

00:45:57.550 --> 00:46:00.390
the same process just to make it clear
here's our viral RNA when it gets into

00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:00.400
here's our viral RNA when it gets into
 

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:02.910
here's our viral RNA when it gets into
the cell it's translated but only half

00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:02.920
the cell it's translated but only half
 

00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:04.770
the cell it's translated but only half
of it is translated there's a stop codon

00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:04.780
of it is translated there's a stop codon
 

00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:07.230
of it is translated there's a stop codon
here that's the red dot so you get these

00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:07.240
here that's the red dot so you get these
 

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:09.540
here that's the red dot so you get these
proteins produced which are the RNA

00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:09.550
proteins produced which are the RNA
 

00:46:09.550 --> 00:46:11.910
proteins produced which are the RNA
polymerase once they're made they can

00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:11.920
polymerase once they're made they can
 

00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:14.190
polymerase once they're made they can
replicate the plus into a minus strand

00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:14.200
replicate the plus into a minus strand
 

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:17.100
replicate the plus into a minus strand
and so on back to plus and minus but

00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:17.110
and so on back to plus and minus but
 

00:46:17.110 --> 00:46:18.780
and so on back to plus and minus but
they can also this polymerase can also

00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:18.790
they can also this polymerase can also
 

00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:22.320
they can also this polymerase can also
make a sub genomic mRNA from the latter

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:22.330
make a sub genomic mRNA from the latter
 

00:46:22.330 --> 00:46:26.130
make a sub genomic mRNA from the latter
half of the negative strand and that can

00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:26.140
half of the negative strand and that can
 

00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:28.320
half of the negative strand and that can
be translated then to access these

00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:28.330
be translated then to access these
 

00:46:28.330 --> 00:46:30.840
be translated then to access these
proteins and again I don't know why it

00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:30.850
proteins and again I don't know why it
 

00:46:30.850 --> 00:46:33.270
proteins and again I don't know why it
works this way you would think that it

00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:33.280
works this way you would think that it
 

00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:35.010
works this way you would think that it
could just you could get rid of this

00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:35.020
could just you could get rid of this
 

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:37.410
could just you could get rid of this
stop codon and just keep translating and

00:46:37.410 --> 00:46:37.420
stop codon and just keep translating and
 

00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:39.810
stop codon and just keep translating and
process it like polio but it doesn't

00:46:39.810 --> 00:46:39.820
process it like polio but it doesn't
 

00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:40.530
process it like polio but it doesn't
work that way

00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:40.540
work that way
 

00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:42.720
work that way
this is evolved so apparently it is

00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:42.730
this is evolved so apparently it is
 

00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:46.170
this is evolved so apparently it is
successful now among the minus strand

00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:46.180
successful now among the minus strand
 

00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:50.610
successful now among the minus strand
RNA viruses there are both uni molecular

00:46:50.610 --> 00:46:50.620
RNA viruses there are both uni molecular
 

00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:53.540
RNA viruses there are both uni molecular
genomes that is an RNA in one piece and

00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:53.550
genomes that is an RNA in one piece and
 

00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:56.550

segmented genomes RNAs and pieces we're
 

00:46:56.560 --> 00:47:00.530
segmented genomes RNAs and pieces we're
going to talk about both of these the

00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:00.540
going to talk about both of these the
 

00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:02.640
going to talk about both of these the
negative strand virus is of course

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:02.650
negative strand virus is of course
 

00:47:02.650 --> 00:47:04.710
negative strand virus is of course
here's the genome of the negative strand

00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:04.720
here's the genome of the negative strand
 

00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:07.050
here's the genome of the negative strand
virus it's negative stranded when it

00:47:07.050 --> 00:47:07.060
virus it's negative stranded when it
 

00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:09.240
virus it's negative stranded when it
gets in the cell can't be recognized by

00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:09.250
gets in the cell can't be recognized by
 

00:47:09.250 --> 00:47:11.460
gets in the cell can't be recognized by
the translation apparatus so it has to

00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:11.470
the translation apparatus so it has to
 

00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:13.920
the translation apparatus so it has to
come in the cell with an RNA polymerase

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:13.930
come in the cell with an RNA polymerase
 

00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:17.100
come in the cell with an RNA polymerase
and that RNA polymerase has to make mRNA

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:17.110
and that RNA polymerase has to make mRNA
 

00:47:17.110 --> 00:47:19.350
and that RNA polymerase has to make mRNA
as the first step otherwise you can't

00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:19.360
as the first step otherwise you can't
 

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:23.220
as the first step otherwise you can't
make proteins yeah it comes in with

00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:23.230
make proteins yeah it comes in with
 

00:47:23.230 --> 00:47:26.840
make proteins yeah it comes in with
proteins

00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:26.850
 

00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:30.270
nothing can read it exactly whenever you

00:47:30.270 --> 00:47:30.280
nothing can read it exactly whenever you
 

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:32.370
nothing can read it exactly whenever you
have a minus strand RNA coming into the

00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:32.380
have a minus strand RNA coming into the
 

00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:34.350
have a minus strand RNA coming into the
cell it always has to come in with

00:47:34.350 --> 00:47:34.360
cell it always has to come in with
 

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:37.230
cell it always has to come in with
proteins multiple proteins that can copy

00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:37.240
proteins multiple proteins that can copy
 

00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:38.790
proteins multiple proteins that can copy
it and make message and that's what you

00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:38.800
it and make message and that's what you
 

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:42.120
it and make message and that's what you
see here this is making messenger RNA

00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:42.130
see here this is making messenger RNA
 

00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:43.950
see here this is making messenger RNA
from this minus strand so that goes for

00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:43.960
from this minus strand so that goes for
 

00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:46.140
from this minus strand so that goes for
the Uni molecular aren't viruses or the

00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:46.150
the Uni molecular aren't viruses or the
 

00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:47.760
the Uni molecular aren't viruses or the
segmented viruses you always have to

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:47.770
segmented viruses you always have to
 

00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:50.520
segmented viruses you always have to
make a messenger RNA first once you make

00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:50.530
make a messenger RNA first once you make
 

00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:52.470
make a messenger RNA first once you make
a message then you can make proteins and

00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:52.480
a message then you can make proteins and
 

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:54.450
a message then you can make proteins and
then you can replicate your genomes

00:47:54.450 --> 00:47:54.460
then you can replicate your genomes
 

00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:56.820
then you can replicate your genomes
which is what's happening here you make

00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:56.830
which is what's happening here you make
 

00:47:56.830 --> 00:47:59.310
which is what's happening here you make
a plus strand intermediate which you

00:47:59.310 --> 00:47:59.320
a plus strand intermediate which you
 

00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:01.560
a plus strand intermediate which you
throw away after you've copied it into

00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:01.570
throw away after you've copied it into
 

00:48:01.570 --> 00:48:03.690
throw away after you've copied it into
negative strands so it's the opposite of

00:48:03.690 --> 00:48:03.700
negative strands so it's the opposite of
 

00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:06.000
negative strands so it's the opposite of
the plus strand viruses for both uni

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:06.010
the plus strand viruses for both uni
 

00:48:06.010 --> 00:48:08.940
the plus strand viruses for both uni
molecular and segmented you do mRNA

00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:08.950
molecular and segmented you do mRNA
 

00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:11.280
molecular and segmented you do mRNA
synthesis first and then you do genome

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:11.290
synthesis first and then you do genome
 

00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:14.040
synthesis first and then you do genome
replication so let's look at this

00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:14.050
replication so let's look at this
 

00:48:14.050 --> 00:48:16.800
replication so let's look at this
process and a little detail here is our

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:16.810
process and a little detail here is our
 

00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:19.170
process and a little detail here is our

it's complexed with proteins remember

00:48:28.830 --> 00:48:28.840
it's complexed with proteins remember
 

00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:29.640
it's complexed with proteins remember
it's not naked

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:29.650
it's not naked
 

00:48:29.650 --> 00:48:31.440
it's not naked
it can't be translated it's a negative

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:31.450
it can't be translated it's a negative
 

00:48:31.450 --> 00:48:35.580
it can't be translated it's a negative
strand RNA so that has to be made into

00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:35.590
strand RNA so that has to be made into
 

00:48:35.590 --> 00:48:37.950
strand RNA so that has to be made into
mRNAs that's step 3 here we have

00:48:37.950 --> 00:48:37.960
mRNAs that's step 3 here we have
 

00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:40.530
mRNAs that's step 3 here we have
individual mRNAs which are then

00:48:40.530 --> 00:48:40.540
individual mRNAs which are then
 

00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:42.690
individual mRNAs which are then
translated into proteins and one of

00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:42.700
translated into proteins and one of
 

00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:44.820
translated into proteins and one of
these proteins goes on and replicates

00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:44.830
these proteins goes on and replicates
 

00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:48.810
these proteins goes on and replicates
the RNA and makes more mRNAs alright so

00:48:48.810 --> 00:48:48.820
the RNA and makes more mRNAs alright so
 

00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:50.880
the RNA and makes more mRNAs alright so
again to translate you have to make a

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:50.890
again to translate you have to make a
 

00:48:50.890 --> 00:48:52.710
again to translate you have to make a
messenger RNA and that all these

00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:52.720
messenger RNA and that all these
 

00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:56.430
messenger RNA and that all these
proteins that are bound to the RNA have

00:48:56.430 --> 00:48:56.440
proteins that are bound to the RNA have
 

00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:58.500
proteins that are bound to the RNA have
a role in that they constitute not only

00:48:58.500 --> 00:48:58.510
a role in that they constitute not only
 

00:48:58.510 --> 00:49:00.510
a role in that they constitute not only
the repetitive nuclear protein that

00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:00.520
the repetitive nuclear protein that
 

00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:02.040
the repetitive nuclear protein that
makes the helix but also the RNA

00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:02.050
makes the helix but also the RNA
 

00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:05.760
makes the helix but also the RNA
polymerase is in there as well and

00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:05.770
polymerase is in there as well and
 

00:49:05.770 --> 00:49:08.210
polymerase is in there as well and

that's why we call it uni molecular and

00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:15.300
that's why we call it uni molecular and
 

00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:17.700
that's why we call it uni molecular and
when this comes into a cell it's

00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:17.710
when this comes into a cell it's
 

00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:19.980
when this comes into a cell it's
negative stranded it can't be translated

00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:19.990
negative stranded it can't be translated
 

00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:22.230
negative stranded it can't be translated
it has to be copied into messenger rnas

00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:22.240
it has to be copied into messenger rnas
 

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:23.610
it has to be copied into messenger rnas
and that's what these little guys are

00:49:23.610 --> 00:49:23.620
and that's what these little guys are
 

00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:27.630
and that's what these little guys are
down here these are 1 2 3 4 5

00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:27.640
down here these are 1 2 3 4 5
 

00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:30.120
down here these are 1 2 3 4 5
mrnas they're all capped they all have a

00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:30.130
mrnas they're all capped they all have a
 

00:49:30.130 --> 00:49:32.310
mrnas they're all capped they all have a
poly a tail they look just like cellular

00:49:32.310 --> 00:49:32.320
poly a tail they look just like cellular
 

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:35.520
poly a tail they look just like cellular
mRNAs and the cell ribosomes just bind

00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:35.530
mRNAs and the cell ribosomes just bind
 

00:49:35.530 --> 00:49:37.110
mRNAs and the cell ribosomes just bind
to them and translate and you get all

00:49:37.110 --> 00:49:37.120
to them and translate and you get all
 

00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:40.410
to them and translate and you get all
the viral proteins make mRNAs first step

00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:40.420
the viral proteins make mRNAs first step
 

00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:42.600
the viral proteins make mRNAs first step
and then one of the proteins made is the

00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:42.610
and then one of the proteins made is the
 

00:49:42.610 --> 00:49:44.280
and then one of the proteins made is the
RNA polymerase which is this the L

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:44.290
RNA polymerase which is this the L
 

00:49:44.290 --> 00:49:47.370
RNA polymerase which is this the L
protein and that can then take this this

00:49:47.370 --> 00:49:47.380
protein and that can then take this this
 

00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:49.200
protein and that can then take this this
negative strand genome and make a plus

00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:49.210
negative strand genome and make a plus
 

00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:51.690
negative strand genome and make a plus
strand it has to make a full-length plus

00:49:51.690 --> 00:49:51.700
strand it has to make a full-length plus
 

00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:53.520
strand it has to make a full-length plus
strand remember from end to end it has

00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:53.530
strand remember from end to end it has
 

00:49:53.530 --> 00:49:55.710
strand remember from end to end it has
to copy the whole thing you can't just

00:49:55.710 --> 00:49:55.720
to copy the whole thing you can't just
 

00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:57.510
to copy the whole thing you can't just
make them mRNA you'll never get the

00:49:57.510 --> 00:49:57.520
make them mRNA you'll never get the
 

00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:59.370
make them mRNA you'll never get the
virus back from those right because

00:49:59.370 --> 00:49:59.380
virus back from those right because
 

00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:01.050
virus back from those right because
you're missing sequences in between them

00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:01.060
you're missing sequences in between them
 

00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:02.490
you're missing sequences in between them
that's why you have to make a plus

00:50:02.490 --> 00:50:02.500
that's why you have to make a plus
 

00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:05.400
that's why you have to make a plus
strand intermediate so here's how that

00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:05.410
strand intermediate so here's how that
 

00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:06.030
strand intermediate so here's how that
works

00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:06.040
works
 

00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:10.770
works
you have our viral RNA a polymerase goes

00:50:10.770 --> 00:50:10.780
you have our viral RNA a polymerase goes
 

00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:12.870
you have our viral RNA a polymerase goes
on the three prime end that comes in

00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:12.880
on the three prime end that comes in
 

00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:15.210
on the three prime end that comes in
with the virus that makes these mRNA s

00:50:15.210 --> 00:50:15.220
with the virus that makes these mRNA s
 

00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:17.250
with the virus that makes these mRNA s
here and then eventually when you get

00:50:17.250 --> 00:50:17.260
here and then eventually when you get
 

00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:19.680
here and then eventually when you get
some proteins made the process switches

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:19.690
some proteins made the process switches
 

00:50:19.690 --> 00:50:21.600
some proteins made the process switches
to replication which is to make a plus

00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:21.610
to replication which is to make a plus
 

00:50:21.610 --> 00:50:24.450
to replication which is to make a plus
strand and then a minus strand so there

00:50:24.450 --> 00:50:24.460
strand and then a minus strand so there
 

00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:26.160
strand and then a minus strand so there
is a switch late in the replication

00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:26.170
is a switch late in the replication
 

00:50:26.170 --> 00:50:28.560
is a switch late in the replication
cycle from making messages to making

00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:28.570
cycle from making messages to making
 

00:50:28.570 --> 00:50:30.930
cycle from making messages to making
full-length plus and then minus strands

00:50:30.930 --> 00:50:30.940
full-length plus and then minus strands
 

00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:32.160
full-length plus and then minus strands
because eventually you have to make new

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:32.170
because eventually you have to make new
 

00:50:32.170 --> 00:50:34.170
because eventually you have to make new
virions and to do that you need more

00:50:34.170 --> 00:50:34.180
virions and to do that you need more
 

00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:40.080
virions and to do that you need more
minus strands right the organization of

00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:40.090
minus strands right the organization of
 

00:50:40.090 --> 00:50:42.270
minus strands right the organization of
this virus goes back to that problem

00:50:42.270 --> 00:50:42.280
this virus goes back to that problem
 

00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:46.710
this virus goes back to that problem
that we had before you have one mRNA or

00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:46.720
that we had before you have one mRNA or
 

00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:48.750
that we had before you have one mRNA or
one RNA and you have to make multiple

00:50:48.750 --> 00:50:48.760
one RNA and you have to make multiple
 

00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:51.300
one RNA and you have to make multiple
proteins from it so this virus's

RNA then it stops and that mRNA comes

00:51:22.050 --> 00:51:22.060
RNA then it stops and that mRNA comes
 

00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:23.940

RNA then it stops and that RNA is

00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:31.510
RNA then it stops and that RNA is
 

00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:33.420
RNA then it stops and that RNA is
released and it keeps going down the

there when the polymerase sees that it
starts to put A's in and it keeps going

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:50.410
starts to put A's in and it keeps going
 

00:51:50.410 --> 00:51:52.200
starts to put A's in and it keeps going
until there are one or two hundred days

00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:52.210
until there are one or two hundred days
 

00:51:52.210 --> 00:51:55.170
until there are one or two hundred days
and that's a poly a tail so from a

full-blown poly a tail at the end of
 

00:52:01.690 --> 00:52:04.320
full-blown poly a tail at the end of
each messenger RNA and then it stops

00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:04.330
each messenger RNA and then it stops
 

00:52:04.330 --> 00:52:06.870
each messenger RNA and then it stops
making poly a it's it slips down a

that come in with each segment so these

00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:12.190
that come in with each segment so these
 

00:53:12.190 --> 00:53:14.280
that come in with each segment so these
are these mRNAs shown here those get

00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:14.290
are these mRNAs shown here those get
 

00:53:14.290 --> 00:53:16.200
are these mRNAs shown here those get
exported into the cytoplasm to make

00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:19.510
viral proteins eventually you also have
 

00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:22.080
viral proteins eventually you also have
to make more genomes these guys here so

00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:22.090
to make more genomes these guys here so
 

00:53:22.090 --> 00:53:24.570
to make more genomes these guys here so
you take your incoming negative strands

00:53:24.570 --> 00:53:24.580
you take your incoming negative strands
 

00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:26.490
you take your incoming negative strands
you make a full-length plus strand and

00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:26.500
you make a full-length plus strand and
 

00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:28.980
you make a full-length plus strand and
from those you make more genomes and

00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:28.990
from those you make more genomes and
 

00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:31.760
from those you make more genomes and
those go on to form new virus particles

00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:31.770
those go on to form new virus particles
 

00:53:31.770 --> 00:53:34.980
those go on to form new virus particles
now there's one aspect of this process

00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:34.990
now there's one aspect of this process
 

00:53:34.990 --> 00:53:36.240
now there's one aspect of this process
that I want to tell you in some detail

00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:36.250
that I want to tell you in some detail
 

00:53:36.250 --> 00:53:39.450
that I want to tell you in some detail
and that is the priming of the mRNA

00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:39.460
and that is the priming of the mRNA
 

00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:41.490
and that is the priming of the mRNA
synthesis in other words the incoming

00:53:41.490 --> 00:53:41.500
synthesis in other words the incoming
 

00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:44.210
synthesis in other words the incoming
minus strand you make an mRNA from it

00:53:44.210 --> 00:53:44.220
minus strand you make an mRNA from it
 

00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:47.070
minus strand you make an mRNA from it
that enzyme that comes in with the

00:53:47.070 --> 00:53:47.080
that enzyme that comes in with the
 

00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:50.010
that enzyme that comes in with the
segment is primer dependent the primer

00:53:50.010 --> 00:53:50.020
segment is primer dependent the primer
 

00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:54.980
segment is primer dependent the primer
that is used comes from cellular mRNAs

00:53:54.980 --> 00:53:54.990
that is used comes from cellular mRNAs
 

00:53:54.990 --> 00:53:58.170
that is used comes from cellular mRNAs
so here is an overall view of that again

00:53:58.170 --> 00:53:58.180
so here is an overall view of that again
 

00:53:58.180 --> 00:54:01.830
so here is an overall view of that again
for flu we have eight RNA segments

00:54:01.830 --> 00:54:01.840
for flu we have eight RNA segments
 

00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:04.110
for flu we have eight RNA segments
they're all negative stranded when those

00:54:04.110 --> 00:54:04.120
they're all negative stranded when those
 

00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:06.180
they're all negative stranded when those
get in the nucleus you make mRNA s from

00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:06.190
get in the nucleus you make mRNA s from
 

00:54:06.190 --> 00:54:07.770
get in the nucleus you make mRNA s from
each of them and those are translated

00:54:07.770 --> 00:54:07.780
each of them and those are translated
 

00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:11.460
each of them and those are translated
into protein that process from negative

00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:11.470
into protein that process from negative
 

00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:14.750
into protein that process from negative
strand to mRNA requires a primer and

00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:14.760
strand to mRNA requires a primer and
 

00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:17.780
strand to mRNA requires a primer and
here is the primer that is used for that

00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:17.790
here is the primer that is used for that
 

00:54:17.790 --> 00:54:20.780
here is the primer that is used for that
it's right here it is a small piece of

00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:20.790
it's right here it is a small piece of
 

00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:24.870
it's right here it is a small piece of
mRNA from the host cell so this is the

00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:24.880
mRNA from the host cell so this is the
 

00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:27.630
mRNA from the host cell so this is the
viral RNA comes in covered with proteins

00:54:27.630 --> 00:54:27.640
viral RNA comes in covered with proteins
 

00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:30.240
viral RNA comes in covered with proteins
and from it the first thing that has to

00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:30.250
and from it the first thing that has to
 

00:54:30.250 --> 00:54:34.260
and from it the first thing that has to
happen is we want to make mRNA the RNA

00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:34.270
happen is we want to make mRNA the RNA
 

00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:35.970
happen is we want to make mRNA the RNA
polymerase that's embedded with this

00:54:35.970 --> 00:54:35.980
polymerase that's embedded with this
 

00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:39.060
polymerase that's embedded with this
segment needs a primer and so what it

00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:39.070
segment needs a primer and so what it
 

00:54:39.070 --> 00:54:41.220
segment needs a primer and so what it
does is it grabs a host mRNA that

00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:41.230
does is it grabs a host mRNA that
 

00:54:41.230 --> 00:54:43.830
does is it grabs a host mRNA that
happens to be near it and it cuts its 5

00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:43.840
happens to be near it and it cuts its 5
 

00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:46.380
happens to be near it and it cuts its 5
prime end off and it takes the cap plus

00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:46.390
prime end off and it takes the cap plus
 

00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:49.680
prime end off and it takes the cap plus
about 10 or 12 bases from that mRNA and

00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:49.690
about 10 or 12 bases from that mRNA and
 

00:54:49.690 --> 00:54:51.300
about 10 or 12 bases from that mRNA and
it uses that as a primer and that's why

00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:51.310
it uses that as a primer and that's why
 

00:54:51.310 --> 00:54:53.850
it uses that as a primer and that's why
we think these viruses have to replicate

00:54:53.850 --> 00:54:53.860
we think these viruses have to replicate
 

00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:56.430
we think these viruses have to replicate
in the nucleus because they need newly

00:54:56.430 --> 00:54:56.440
in the nucleus because they need newly
 

00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:59.070
in the nucleus because they need newly
synthesized mRNAs produced in the

00:54:59.070 --> 00:54:59.080
synthesized mRNAs produced in the
 

00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:02.640
synthesized mRNAs produced in the

mRNA in the cell so that mRNA has a cell

00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:24.760
mRNA in the cell so that mRNA has a cell
 

00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:27.450
mRNA in the cell so that mRNA has a cell
derived primer at the 5 prime end and it

00:55:27.450 --> 00:55:27.460
derived primer at the 5 prime end and it
 

00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:30.300
derived primer at the 5 prime end and it
also stops at about 20 nucleotides short

00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:30.310
also stops at about 20 nucleotides short
 

00:55:30.310 --> 00:55:32.430
also stops at about 20 nucleotides short
of the template because then it's

00:55:32.430 --> 00:55:32.440
of the template because then it's
 

00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:35.430
of the template because then it's
polyadenylated so this mRNA would not be

00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:35.440
polyadenylated so this mRNA would not be
 

00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:37.680
polyadenylated so this mRNA would not be
good for making more viruses because

00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:37.690
good for making more viruses because
 

00:55:37.690 --> 00:55:40.020
good for making more viruses because
it's lacking sequence down here at the 3

00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:40.030
it's lacking sequence down here at the 3
 

00:55:40.030 --> 00:55:42.450
it's lacking sequence down here at the 3
prime end alright remember I said the a

00:55:42.450 --> 00:55:42.460

requirement for genome replication is

00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:44.350
requirement for genome replication is
 

00:55:44.350 --> 00:55:45.930
requirement for genome replication is
that you have to copy the genome from

00:55:45.930 --> 00:55:45.940
that you have to copy the genome from
 

00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:49.440
that you have to copy the genome from
end to end and this is not doing that

00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:49.450
end to end and this is not doing that
 

00:55:49.450 --> 00:55:51.690
end to end and this is not doing that
you're actually ending up short so

00:55:51.690 --> 00:55:51.700
you're actually ending up short so
 

00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:53.910
you're actually ending up short so
that's why we need another replication

00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:53.920
that's why we need another replication
 

00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:56.130
that's why we need another replication
step we have to copy this negative

00:55:56.130 --> 00:55:56.140
step we have to copy this negative
 

00:55:56.140 --> 00:55:57.930
step we have to copy this negative
strand into a full-length plus strand

00:55:57.930 --> 00:55:57.940
strand into a full-length plus strand
 

00:55:57.940 --> 00:56:00.630
strand into a full-length plus strand
and then copy it into a full-length

00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:00.640
and then copy it into a full-length
 

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:02.550
and then copy it into a full-length
minus strand and that is going to be our

00:56:02.550 --> 00:56:02.560
minus strand and that is going to be our
 

00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:05.100
minus strand and that is going to be our
genome RNA so the details here are not

00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:05.110
genome RNA so the details here are not
 

00:56:05.110 --> 00:56:07.170
genome RNA so the details here are not
important for you to know that are well

00:56:07.170 --> 00:56:07.180
important for you to know that are well
 

00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:08.100
important for you to know that are well
these proteins he

00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:08.110
these proteins he
 

00:56:08.110 --> 00:56:09.600
these proteins he
here the important thing is is that the

00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:09.610
here the important thing is is that the
 

00:56:09.610 --> 00:56:12.090
here the important thing is is that the
MRNA isn't a full-length copy and that's

00:56:12.090 --> 00:56:12.100
MRNA isn't a full-length copy and that's
 

00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:18.830
MRNA isn't a full-length copy and that's
why you need to make a plus strand yeah

00:56:18.830 --> 00:56:18.840
 

00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:20.340
exactly

00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:20.350
exactly
 

00:56:20.350 --> 00:56:24.000
exactly
yes to make this RNA from the negative

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:24.010
yes to make this RNA from the negative
 

00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:26.190
yes to make this RNA from the negative
strand you do not need a primer it's

00:56:26.190 --> 00:56:26.200
strand you do not need a primer it's
 

00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:28.350
strand you do not need a primer it's
unprimed as you see here it it's very

00:56:28.350 --> 00:56:28.360
unprimed as you see here it it's very
 

00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:30.030
unprimed as you see here it it's very
interesting actually because the same

00:56:30.030 --> 00:56:30.040
interesting actually because the same
 

00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:32.160
interesting actually because the same
that the enzyme is slightly different so

00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:32.170
that the enzyme is slightly different so
 

00:56:32.170 --> 00:56:33.930
that the enzyme is slightly different so
in one case to make mRNA its primer

00:56:33.930 --> 00:56:33.940
in one case to make mRNA its primer
 

00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:35.760
in one case to make mRNA its primer
dependent and in the other case its

00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:35.770
dependent and in the other case its
 

00:56:35.770 --> 00:56:40.290
dependent and in the other case its
primer independent and here's some

00:56:40.290 --> 00:56:40.300
primer independent and here's some
 

00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:43.190
primer independent and here's some
detail on that very interesting process

00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:43.200
detail on that very interesting process
 

00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:46.740
detail on that very interesting process
we call it cap snatching stealing of the

00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:46.750
we call it cap snatching stealing of the
 

00:56:46.750 --> 00:56:49.920
we call it cap snatching stealing of the
cap from the host mRNA to Prime mRNA

00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:49.930
cap from the host mRNA to Prime mRNA
 

00:56:49.930 --> 00:56:53.640
cap from the host mRNA to Prime mRNA
synthesis so here is the viral RNA it's

00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:53.650
synthesis so here is the viral RNA it's
 

00:56:53.650 --> 00:56:57.090
synthesis so here is the viral RNA it's
the three prime end here is a host mrna

00:56:57.090 --> 00:56:57.100
the three prime end here is a host mrna
 

00:56:57.100 --> 00:56:58.800
the three prime end here is a host mrna
there's a cap structure and then some

00:56:58.800 --> 00:56:58.810
there's a cap structure and then some
 

00:56:58.810 --> 00:57:00.660
there's a cap structure and then some
bases and as I told you the viral RNA

00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:00.670
bases and as I told you the viral RNA
 

00:57:00.670 --> 00:57:02.250
bases and as I told you the viral RNA
polymerase actually has an endonuclease

00:57:02.250 --> 00:57:02.260
polymerase actually has an endonuclease
 

00:57:02.260 --> 00:57:06.270
polymerase actually has an endonuclease
activity so it Cleaves host mRNAs about

00:57:06.270 --> 00:57:06.280
activity so it Cleaves host mRNAs about
 

00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:09.000
activity so it Cleaves host mRNAs about
here 13 bases on this one and then the

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:09.010
here 13 bases on this one and then the
 

00:57:09.010 --> 00:57:11.370
here 13 bases on this one and then the
primer that results is used to initiate

00:57:11.370 --> 00:57:11.380
primer that results is used to initiate
 

00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:14.730
primer that results is used to initiate
synthesis of the messenger RNA which you

00:57:14.730 --> 00:57:14.740
synthesis of the messenger RNA which you
 

00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:16.860
synthesis of the messenger RNA which you
can see here so here's the mRNA that's

00:57:16.860 --> 00:57:16.870
can see here so here's the mRNA that's
 

00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:18.000
can see here so here's the mRNA that's
made this is the negative strand

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:18.010
made this is the negative strand
 

00:57:18.010 --> 00:57:20.010
made this is the negative strand
template and they all have this bit of

00:57:20.010 --> 00:57:20.020
template and they all have this bit of
 

00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:23.190
template and they all have this bit of
sequence from host mRNAs so that's

00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:23.200
sequence from host mRNAs so that's
 

00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:25.310
sequence from host mRNAs so that's
probably one of the reasons why you need

00:57:25.310 --> 00:57:25.320
probably one of the reasons why you need
 

00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:28.850
probably one of the reasons why you need
to be in the nucleus for these viruses

00:57:28.850 --> 00:57:28.860
to be in the nucleus for these viruses
 

00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:31.580
to be in the nucleus for these viruses
now all of these mRNAs are

00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:31.590
now all of these mRNAs are
 

00:57:31.590 --> 00:57:34.590
now all of these mRNAs are
polyadenylated and remember I told you

00:57:34.590 --> 00:57:34.600
polyadenylated and remember I told you
 

00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:39.570
polyadenylated and remember I told you
they end up about 20 bases short of the

00:57:39.570 --> 00:57:39.580
they end up about 20 bases short of the
 

00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:41.880
they end up about 20 bases short of the
template and so this is a model of why

00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:41.890
template and so this is a model of why
 

00:57:41.890 --> 00:57:43.380
template and so this is a model of why
that happens it's actually very clever

00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:43.390
that happens it's actually very clever
 

00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:46.530
that happens it's actually very clever
now normally you imagine a template in a

00:57:46.530 --> 00:57:46.540
now normally you imagine a template in a
 

00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:48.930
now normally you imagine a template in a
polymerase is moving along the template

00:57:48.930 --> 00:57:48.940
polymerase is moving along the template
 

00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:51.390
polymerase is moving along the template
and copying it and a nucleic acid is

00:57:51.390 --> 00:57:51.400
and copying it and a nucleic acid is
 

00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:54.180
and copying it and a nucleic acid is
being made but here we think the

00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:54.190
being made but here we think the
 

00:57:54.190 --> 00:57:56.430
being made but here we think the
template is being pulled through the

00:57:56.430 --> 00:57:56.440
template is being pulled through the
 

00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:58.920
template is being pulled through the
polymerase somehow so this limb race

00:57:58.920 --> 00:57:58.930
polymerase somehow so this limb race
 

00:57:58.930 --> 00:58:02.010
polymerase somehow so this limb race
consists of three subunits and here is

00:58:02.010 --> 00:58:02.020
consists of three subunits and here is
 

00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:05.760
consists of three subunits and here is
the viral RNA here in the olive green

00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:05.770
the viral RNA here in the olive green
 

00:58:05.770 --> 00:58:08.100
the viral RNA here in the olive green
it's negative stranded all right it's

00:58:08.100 --> 00:58:08.110
it's negative stranded all right it's
 

00:58:08.110 --> 00:58:10.500
it's negative stranded all right it's
bound here the 5 prime end to the

00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:10.510
bound here the 5 prime end to the
 

00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:13.850
bound here the 5 prime end to the
polymerase the this is a polymerase

00:58:13.850 --> 00:58:13.860
polymerase the this is a polymerase
 

00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:17.700
polymerase the this is a polymerase
making a plus strand mRNA so here's the

00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:17.710
making a plus strand mRNA so here's the
 

00:58:17.710 --> 00:58:19.500
making a plus strand mRNA so here's the
active site of the polymerase it's being

00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:19.510
active site of the polymerase it's being
 

00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:21.480
active site of the polymerase it's being
elongated and imagine that

00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:21.490
elongated and imagine that
 

00:58:21.490 --> 00:58:23.370
elongated and imagine that
three prime end is being pulled through

00:58:23.370 --> 00:58:23.380
three prime end is being pulled through
 

00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:26.850
three prime end is being pulled through
this complex so as this moves past the

00:58:26.850 --> 00:58:26.860
this complex so as this moves past the
 

00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:29.580
this complex so as this moves past the
active site you elongate the mRNA

00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:29.590
active site you elongate the mRNA
 

00:58:29.590 --> 00:58:31.830
active site you elongate the mRNA
product you're pulling it through but

00:58:31.830 --> 00:58:31.840
product you're pulling it through but
 

00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:34.230
product you're pulling it through but
eventually when you run out of loop here

00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:34.240
eventually when you run out of loop here
 

00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:37.230
eventually when you run out of loop here
it stops and there's still about 20

00:58:37.230 --> 00:58:37.240
it stops and there's still about 20
 

00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:39.000
it stops and there's still about 20
bases left here but you can't copy them

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:39.010
bases left here but you can't copy them
 

00:58:39.010 --> 00:58:40.710
bases left here but you can't copy them
because you can't move well what you're

00:58:40.710 --> 00:58:40.720
because you can't move well what you're
 

00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:43.560
because you can't move well what you're
stuck at is a stretch of use so what do

00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:43.570
stuck at is a stretch of use so what do
 

00:58:43.570 --> 00:58:45.690
stuck at is a stretch of use so what do
you think happens the enzyme just keeps

00:58:45.690 --> 00:58:45.700
you think happens the enzyme just keeps
 

00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:48.390
you think happens the enzyme just keeps
making A's over and over again until it

00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:48.400
making A's over and over again until it
 

00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:50.400
making A's over and over again until it
gets tired and says that's it I've had

00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:50.410
gets tired and says that's it I've had
 

00:58:50.410 --> 00:58:52.650
gets tired and says that's it I've had
it and it gets the product gets released

00:58:52.650 --> 00:58:52.660
it and it gets the product gets released
 

00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:54.480
it and it gets the product gets released
and you have a poly ventilated mRNA

00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:54.490
and you have a poly ventilated mRNA
 

00:58:54.490 --> 00:58:57.030
and you have a poly ventilated mRNA
which lacks about 20 bases from the

00:58:57.030 --> 00:58:57.040
which lacks about 20 bases from the
 

00:58:57.040 --> 00:58:59.490
which lacks about 20 bases from the
3-prime and so that that may explain why

00:58:59.490 --> 00:58:59.500
3-prime and so that that may explain why
 

00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:01.980
3-prime and so that that may explain why
we're missing those 20 bases because you

00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:01.990
we're missing those 20 bases because you
 

00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:04.440
we're missing those 20 bases because you
have this mechanism of pulling the

00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:04.450
have this mechanism of pulling the
 

00:59:04.450 --> 00:59:08.370
have this mechanism of pulling the
template through okay double-stranded

00:59:08.370 --> 00:59:08.380
template through okay double-stranded
 

00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:10.350
template through okay double-stranded
RNA viruses do something different

00:59:10.350 --> 00:59:10.360
RNA viruses do something different
 

00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:13.020
RNA viruses do something different
because remember the double-stranded RNA

00:59:13.020 --> 00:59:13.030
because remember the double-stranded RNA
 

00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:15.000
because remember the double-stranded RNA
even though it has a plus strand it

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:15.010
even though it has a plus strand it
 

00:59:15.010 --> 00:59:18.330
even though it has a plus strand it
can't be accessed by ribosomes so what

00:59:18.330 --> 00:59:18.340
can't be accessed by ribosomes so what
 

00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:21.900
can't be accessed by ribosomes so what
happens is this double strand is a

00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:21.910
happens is this double strand is a
 

00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:24.690
happens is this double strand is a
template for the synthesis of a plus

00:59:24.690 --> 00:59:24.700
template for the synthesis of a plus
 

00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:28.770
template for the synthesis of a plus
strand mRNA so the viral the virus has

00:59:28.770 --> 00:59:28.780
strand mRNA so the viral the virus has
 

00:59:28.780 --> 00:59:32.010
strand mRNA so the viral the virus has
to bring in an RNA polymerase with it so

00:59:32.010 --> 00:59:32.020
to bring in an RNA polymerase with it so
 

00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:33.570
to bring in an RNA polymerase with it so
you may say well because it has a plus

00:59:33.570 --> 00:59:33.580
you may say well because it has a plus
 

00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:34.890
you may say well because it has a plus
strand couldn't that be used for

00:59:34.890 --> 00:59:34.900
strand couldn't that be used for
 

00:59:34.900 --> 00:59:36.420
strand couldn't that be used for
translation no it can't because it's

00:59:36.420 --> 00:59:36.430
translation no it can't because it's
 

00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:37.710
translation no it can't because it's
double stranded and there's no way to

00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:37.720
double stranded and there's no way to
 

00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:39.870
double stranded and there's no way to
nature it so instead the virus brings in

00:59:39.870 --> 00:59:39.880
nature it so instead the virus brings in
 

00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:41.880
nature it so instead the virus brings in
a polymerase with the particle and then

00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:41.890
a polymerase with the particle and then
 

00:59:41.890 --> 00:59:44.190
a polymerase with the particle and then
copies the negative strand of that

00:59:44.190 --> 00:59:44.200
copies the negative strand of that
 

00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:46.740
copies the negative strand of that
duplex to make a plus strand mRNA for

00:59:46.740 --> 00:59:46.750
duplex to make a plus strand mRNA for
 

00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:50.880
duplex to make a plus strand mRNA for
translation and it actually makes double

00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:50.890
translation and it actually makes double
 

00:59:50.890 --> 00:59:52.800
translation and it actually makes double
strands from a subset of those as well

00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:52.810
strands from a subset of those as well
 

00:59:52.810 --> 00:59:55.830
strands from a subset of those as well
so these are both plus strand mRNAs made

00:59:55.830 --> 00:59:55.840
so these are both plus strand mRNAs made
 

00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:57.450
so these are both plus strand mRNAs made
from the minus strand one is used for

00:59:57.450 --> 00:59:57.460
from the minus strand one is used for
 

00:59:57.460 --> 01:00:01.260
from the minus strand one is used for
translation and one is simply copied to

01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:01.270
translation and one is simply copied to
 

01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:03.030
translation and one is simply copied to
make a negative strand now we have our

01:00:03.030 --> 01:00:03.040
make a negative strand now we have our
 

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:04.620
make a negative strand now we have our
double stranded RNA it's just what we

01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:04.630
double stranded RNA it's just what we
 

01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:07.200
double stranded RNA it's just what we
started with okay and this is again by

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:07.210
started with okay and this is again by
 

01:00:07.210 --> 01:00:09.060
started with okay and this is again by
an enzyme that the virus brings in with

01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:09.070
an enzyme that the virus brings in with
 

01:00:09.070 --> 01:00:11.640
an enzyme that the virus brings in with
it so these are the real viruses and

01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:11.650
it so these are the real viruses and
 

01:00:11.650 --> 01:00:14.430
it so these are the real viruses and
they have segmented double stranded RNA

01:00:14.430 --> 01:00:14.440
they have segmented double stranded RNA
 

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:17.430
they have segmented double stranded RNA
genomes remember these are the viruses

01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:17.440
genomes remember these are the viruses
 

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:19.849
genomes remember these are the viruses
that are the double shell they come in

01:00:19.849 --> 01:00:19.859
that are the double shell they come in
 

01:00:19.859 --> 01:00:22.170
that are the double shell they come in
through the endo siddik pathway the

01:00:22.170 --> 01:00:22.180
through the endo siddik pathway the
 

01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:24.720
through the endo siddik pathway the
outer shell is stripped off and then the

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:24.730
outer shell is stripped off and then the
 

01:00:24.730 --> 01:00:27.260
outer shell is stripped off and then the
core particle goes into the cytoplasm

01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:27.270
core particle goes into the cytoplasm
 

01:00:27.270 --> 01:00:31.320
core particle goes into the cytoplasm
there are a number of double stranded

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:31.330
there are a number of double stranded
 

01:00:31.330 --> 01:00:34.860
there are a number of double stranded
RNA particles 3 6 9 10 for the

01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:34.870
RNA particles 3 6 9 10 for the
 

01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:39.090
RNA particles 3 6 9 10 for the
real virus and from each of those and

01:00:39.090 --> 01:00:39.100
real virus and from each of those and
 

01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:42.330
real virus and from each of those and
mRNA is made shown here and from those

01:00:42.330 --> 01:00:42.340
mRNA is made shown here and from those
 

01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:44.970
mRNA is made shown here and from those
proteins are made again this is not

01:00:44.970 --> 01:00:44.980
proteins are made again this is not
 

01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:46.890
proteins are made again this is not
translated the genomic double strand RNA

01:00:46.890 --> 01:00:46.900
translated the genomic double strand RNA
 

01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:48.960
translated the genomic double strand RNA
is not translated it's copied to form a

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:48.970
is not translated it's copied to form a
 

01:00:48.970 --> 01:00:58.289
is not translated it's copied to form a
plus strand mRNA yes

01:00:58.289 --> 01:00:58.299
 

01:00:58.299 --> 01:01:01.349
I don't know if it has to actually be

01:01:01.349 --> 01:01:01.359
I don't know if it has to actually be
 

01:01:01.359 --> 01:01:02.999
I don't know if it has to actually be
pulled apart it could you could just

01:01:02.999 --> 01:01:03.009
pulled apart it could you could just
 

01:01:03.009 --> 01:01:05.099
pulled apart it could you could just
make a bubble and move it along the

01:01:05.099 --> 01:01:05.109
make a bubble and move it along the
 

01:01:05.109 --> 01:01:08.069
make a bubble and move it along the
duplex yeah so it doesn't necessarily as

01:01:08.069 --> 01:01:08.079
duplex yeah so it doesn't necessarily as
 

01:01:08.079 --> 01:01:10.199
duplex yeah so it doesn't necessarily as
dr. Silverstein will show you for DNA

01:01:10.199 --> 01:01:10.209
dr. Silverstein will show you for DNA
 

01:01:10.209 --> 01:01:12.929
dr. Silverstein will show you for DNA
you don't have to pull the strands you

01:01:12.929 --> 01:01:12.939
you don't have to pull the strands you
 

01:01:12.939 --> 01:01:14.189
you don't have to pull the strands you
don't have to know you can just make a

01:01:14.189 --> 01:01:14.199
don't have to know you can just make a
 

01:01:14.199 --> 01:01:15.719
don't have to know you can just make a
little des natured bubble and the

01:01:15.719 --> 01:01:15.729
little des natured bubble and the
 

01:01:15.729 --> 01:01:17.729
little des natured bubble and the
polymerase can can copy that

01:01:17.729 --> 01:01:17.739
polymerase can can copy that
 

01:01:17.739 --> 01:01:21.059
polymerase can can copy that
yeah it's really very nice so here is a

01:01:21.059 --> 01:01:21.069
yeah it's really very nice so here is a
 

01:01:21.069 --> 01:01:23.039
yeah it's really very nice so here is a
scheme of the replication of these

01:01:23.039 --> 01:01:23.049
scheme of the replication of these
 

01:01:23.049 --> 01:01:25.709
scheme of the replication of these
viruses and what I want to show you here

01:01:25.709 --> 01:01:25.719
viruses and what I want to show you here
 

01:01:25.719 --> 01:01:28.499
viruses and what I want to show you here
is the viruses just focus here the virus

01:01:28.499 --> 01:01:28.509
is the viruses just focus here the virus
 

01:01:28.509 --> 01:01:31.169
is the viruses just focus here the virus
is taken up by endocytosis that outer

01:01:31.169 --> 01:01:31.179
is taken up by endocytosis that outer
 

01:01:31.179 --> 01:01:33.959
is taken up by endocytosis that outer
capsid is stripped off and the particle

01:01:33.959 --> 01:01:33.969
capsid is stripped off and the particle
 

01:01:33.969 --> 01:01:35.910
capsid is stripped off and the particle
gets out of the endosome and now we have

01:01:35.910 --> 01:01:35.920
gets out of the endosome and now we have
 

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:38.459
gets out of the endosome and now we have
this inner shell particle sitting in the

01:01:38.459 --> 01:01:38.469
this inner shell particle sitting in the
 

01:01:38.469 --> 01:01:42.179
this inner shell particle sitting in the
cytoplasm and that still has all the

01:01:42.179 --> 01:01:42.189
cytoplasm and that still has all the
 

01:01:42.189 --> 01:01:44.309
cytoplasm and that still has all the
double-stranded RNAs in it it has the

01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:44.319
double-stranded RNAs in it it has the
 

01:01:44.319 --> 01:01:46.979
double-stranded RNAs in it it has the
enzymes to copy them and that that

01:01:46.979 --> 01:01:46.989
enzymes to copy them and that that
 

01:01:46.989 --> 01:01:48.839
enzymes to copy them and that that
particle just sits there in the and the

01:01:48.839 --> 01:01:48.849
particle just sits there in the and the
 

01:01:48.849 --> 01:01:52.229
particle just sits there in the and the
mRNAs come out of the the each to a

01:01:52.229 --> 01:01:52.239
mRNAs come out of the the each to a
 

01:01:52.239 --> 01:01:54.329
mRNAs come out of the the each to a
fivefold axis of symmetry there are 12

01:01:54.329 --> 01:01:54.339
fivefold axis of symmetry there are 12
 

01:01:54.339 --> 01:01:56.069
fivefold axis of symmetry there are 12
of those remember it's icosahedron and

01:01:56.069 --> 01:01:56.079
of those remember it's icosahedron and
 

01:01:56.079 --> 01:01:57.989
of those remember it's icosahedron and
there's a little channel at each

01:01:57.989 --> 01:01:57.999
there's a little channel at each
 

01:01:57.999 --> 01:01:59.429
there's a little channel at each
fivefold and you can see on this picture

01:01:59.429 --> 01:01:59.439
fivefold and you can see on this picture
 

01:01:59.439 --> 01:02:01.919
fivefold and you can see on this picture
these little squiggly green guys coming

01:02:01.919 --> 01:02:01.929
these little squiggly green guys coming
 

01:02:01.929 --> 01:02:03.359
these little squiggly green guys coming
out here those are mRNAs they're made

01:02:03.359 --> 01:02:03.369
out here those are mRNAs they're made
 

01:02:03.369 --> 01:02:06.059
out here those are mRNAs they're made
inside the particle and shot outside and

01:02:06.059 --> 01:02:06.069
inside the particle and shot outside and
 

01:02:06.069 --> 01:02:08.370
inside the particle and shot outside and
then they're translated in the cytosol

01:02:08.370 --> 01:02:08.380
then they're translated in the cytosol
 

01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:10.439
then they're translated in the cytosol
and they give rise to new particles

01:02:10.439 --> 01:02:10.449
and they give rise to new particles
 

01:02:10.449 --> 01:02:11.910
and they give rise to new particles
eventually we'll talk about that later

01:02:11.910 --> 01:02:11.920
eventually we'll talk about that later
 

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:15.299
eventually we'll talk about that later
but all the mRNA synthesis takes place

01:02:15.299 --> 01:02:15.309
but all the mRNA synthesis takes place
 

01:02:15.309 --> 01:02:17.759
but all the mRNA synthesis takes place
inside the particle so it never really

01:02:17.759 --> 01:02:17.769
inside the particle so it never really
 

01:02:17.769 --> 01:02:19.859
inside the particle so it never really
completely on coats and that's one of

01:02:19.859 --> 01:02:19.869
completely on coats and that's one of
 

01:02:19.869 --> 01:02:21.359
completely on coats and that's one of
the reasons why I said initially that

01:02:21.359 --> 01:02:21.369
the reasons why I said initially that
 

01:02:21.369 --> 01:02:23.759
the reasons why I said initially that
some viruses are active containers that

01:02:23.759 --> 01:02:23.769
some viruses are active containers that
 

01:02:23.769 --> 01:02:26.219
some viruses are active containers that
it doesn't they don't discharge all of

01:02:26.219 --> 01:02:26.229
it doesn't they don't discharge all of
 

01:02:26.229 --> 01:02:28.410
it doesn't they don't discharge all of
their RNA or nucleic acid into the

01:02:28.410 --> 01:02:28.420
their RNA or nucleic acid into the
 

01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:30.499
their RNA or nucleic acid into the
cytoplasm here's the reason for that

01:02:30.499 --> 01:02:30.509
cytoplasm here's the reason for that
 

01:02:30.509 --> 01:02:33.749
cytoplasm here's the reason for that
okay the mRNAs again copied off the

01:02:33.749 --> 01:02:33.759
okay the mRNAs again copied off the
 

01:02:33.759 --> 01:02:35.999
okay the mRNAs again copied off the
double-stranded RNA template by a

01:02:35.999 --> 01:02:36.009
double-stranded RNA template by a
 

01:02:36.009 --> 01:02:37.739
double-stranded RNA template by a
polymerase that's in the particle and

01:02:37.739 --> 01:02:37.749
polymerase that's in the particle and
 

01:02:37.749 --> 01:02:40.019
polymerase that's in the particle and
the mRNAs are extruded through the

01:02:40.019 --> 01:02:40.029
the mRNAs are extruded through the
 

01:02:40.029 --> 01:02:41.729
the mRNAs are extruded through the
turret now there is a very nice

01:02:41.729 --> 01:02:41.739
turret now there is a very nice
 

01:02:41.739 --> 01:02:43.679
turret now there is a very nice
structure of this process which I want

01:02:43.679 --> 01:02:43.689
structure of this process which I want
 

01:02:43.689 --> 01:02:46.009
structure of this process which I want
to show you these are cryo-electron

01:02:46.009 --> 01:02:46.019
to show you these are cryo-electron
 

01:02:46.019 --> 01:02:51.599
to show you these are cryo-electron
microscopy and this family and these

01:02:51.599 --> 01:02:51.609
microscopy and this family and these
 

01:02:51.609 --> 01:02:54.569
microscopy and this family and these
were in the process of making mRNA when

01:02:54.569 --> 01:02:54.579
were in the process of making mRNA when
 

01:02:54.579 --> 01:02:57.509
were in the process of making mRNA when
the cryo e/m was done so here's the

01:02:57.509 --> 01:02:57.519
the cryo e/m was done so here's the
 

01:02:57.519 --> 01:02:59.519
the cryo e/m was done so here's the
particle here you can see these little

01:02:59.519 --> 01:02:59.529
particle here you can see these little
 

01:02:59.529 --> 01:03:01.529
particle here you can see these little
purple things sticking out here that's

01:03:01.529 --> 01:03:01.539
purple things sticking out here that's
 

01:03:01.539 --> 01:03:03.779
purple things sticking out here that's
the that's the mRNA coming out right

01:03:03.779 --> 01:03:03.789
the that's the mRNA coming out right
 

01:03:03.789 --> 01:03:04.349
the that's the mRNA coming out right
here

01:03:04.349 --> 01:03:04.359
here
 

01:03:04.359 --> 01:03:06.660
here
so right there so this is one of the 12

01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:06.670
so right there so this is one of the 12
 

01:03:06.670 --> 01:03:09.329
so right there so this is one of the 12
turrets at each fivefold axis of

01:03:09.329 --> 01:03:09.339
turrets at each fivefold axis of
 

01:03:09.339 --> 01:03:12.150
turrets at each fivefold axis of
symmetry and I told you we think the RNA

01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:12.160
symmetry and I told you we think the RNA
 

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:13.799
symmetry and I told you we think the RNA
out of here as its made in the interior

01:03:13.799 --> 01:03:13.809
out of here as its made in the interior
 

01:03:13.809 --> 01:03:15.630
out of here as its made in the interior
and this is actually a model for how

01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:15.640
and this is actually a model for how
 

01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:18.329
and this is actually a model for how
that might happen the only density they

01:03:18.329 --> 01:03:18.339
that might happen the only density they
 

01:03:18.339 --> 01:03:21.029
that might happen the only density they
got in these cryo Am's was this little

01:03:21.029 --> 01:03:21.039
got in these cryo Am's was this little
 

01:03:21.039 --> 01:03:23.819
got in these cryo Am's was this little
bit here and they they filled in the

01:03:23.819 --> 01:03:23.829
bit here and they they filled in the
 

01:03:23.829 --> 01:03:26.069
bit here and they they filled in the
rest this is the RNA the mRNA coming out

01:03:26.069 --> 01:03:26.079
rest this is the RNA the mRNA coming out
 

01:03:26.079 --> 01:03:28.109
rest this is the RNA the mRNA coming out
of this portal if you will It's Made

01:03:28.109 --> 01:03:28.119
of this portal if you will It's Made
 

01:03:28.119 --> 01:03:31.289
of this portal if you will It's Made
inside the particle and comes out very

01:03:31.289 --> 01:03:31.299
inside the particle and comes out very
 

01:03:31.299 --> 01:03:36.329
inside the particle and comes out very
neat now an important thing that you

01:03:36.329 --> 01:03:36.339
neat now an important thing that you
 

01:03:36.339 --> 01:03:38.849
neat now an important thing that you
should know is that RNA synthesis is an

01:03:38.849 --> 01:03:38.859
should know is that RNA synthesis is an
 

01:03:38.859 --> 01:03:41.400
should know is that RNA synthesis is an
important source of diversity all of

01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:43.030
these polymerases that we've talked
 

01:03:43.030 --> 01:03:45.420
these polymerases that we've talked
about today they make errors well in

01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:45.430
about today they make errors well in
 

01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:47.670
about today they make errors well in
fact every nucleic acid polymerase makes

01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:47.680
fact every nucleic acid polymerase makes
 

01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:51.359
fact every nucleic acid polymerase makes

bases that they make so you some of

01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:56.170
bases that they make so you some of
 

01:03:56.170 --> 01:03:57.660
bases that they make so you some of
these viral genomes are ten thousand

01:03:57.660 --> 01:03:57.670
these viral genomes are ten thousand
 

01:03:57.670 --> 01:03:59.579
these viral genomes are ten thousand
bases long so every time they're copied

01:03:59.579 --> 01:03:59.589
bases long so every time they're copied
 

01:03:59.589 --> 01:04:01.980
bases long so every time they're copied
there's a mistake made the wrong base is

01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:01.990
there's a mistake made the wrong base is
 

01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:03.930
there's a mistake made the wrong base is
put in despite those wonderful

01:04:03.930 --> 01:04:03.940
put in despite those wonderful
 

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:06.210

polymerases you know that sometimes they

01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:06.220
polymerases you know that sometimes they
 

01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:08.010
polymerases you know that sometimes they
see a there's an a there and they put

01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:08.020
see a there's an a there and they put
 

01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:10.799

something else instead of a you now RNA

01:04:10.799 --> 01:04:10.809
something else instead of a you now RNA
 

01:04:10.809 --> 01:04:12.329

polymerase is don't have proofreading

01:04:12.329 --> 01:04:12.339
polymerase is don't have proofreading
 

01:04:12.339 --> 01:04:15.150
polymerase is don't have proofreading
like DNA polymerases do they can say the

01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:15.160
like DNA polymerases do they can say the
 

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:17.910
like DNA polymerases do they can say the
wrong base here take it out and fix it

01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:17.920
wrong base here take it out and fix it
 

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:19.500
wrong base here take it out and fix it
but RNA polymerase is don't do that so

01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:19.510
but RNA polymerase is don't do that so
 

01:04:19.510 --> 01:04:22.200
but RNA polymerase is don't do that so
they have the very high error rate but

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:22.210
they have the very high error rate but
 

01:04:22.210 --> 01:04:24.809
they have the very high error rate but
in many ways that's good because it

01:04:24.809 --> 01:04:24.819
in many ways that's good because it
 

01:04:24.819 --> 01:04:27.000
in many ways that's good because it
contributes to the diversity of RNA

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:27.010
contributes to the diversity of RNA
 

01:04:27.010 --> 01:04:31.079
contributes to the diversity of RNA
viruses and in fact we're gonna use

01:04:31.079 --> 01:04:31.089
viruses and in fact we're gonna use
 

01:04:31.089 --> 01:04:32.990
viruses and in fact we're gonna use
we're going to talk about that much more

01:04:32.990 --> 01:04:33.000
we're going to talk about that much more
 

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.109
we're going to talk about that much more
later on in this course because it is an

01:04:37.109 --> 01:04:37.119
later on in this course because it is an
 

01:04:37.119 --> 01:04:38.819
later on in this course because it is an
important source of new viruses and

01:04:38.819 --> 01:04:38.829
important source of new viruses and
 

01:04:38.829 --> 01:04:40.620
important source of new viruses and
viral evolution so just remember that

01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:40.630
viral evolution so just remember that
 

01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:43.890
viral evolution so just remember that
this RNA synthesis is really important

01:04:43.890 --> 01:04:43.900
this RNA synthesis is really important
 

01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:47.460
this RNA synthesis is really important
for diversity of RNA viruses and I

01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:47.470
for diversity of RNA viruses and I
 

01:04:47.470 --> 01:04:48.740
for diversity of RNA viruses and I
promised I'd tell you about the non

promised I'd tell you about the non
 

01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:51.510
promised I'd tell you about the non
templated RNA synthesis that occurs for

01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:51.520
templated RNA synthesis that occurs for
 

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:54.140
templated RNA synthesis that occurs for
some viruses all that means is that

01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:54.150
some viruses all that means is that
 

01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:56.730
some viruses all that means is that
templated RNA synthesis you have an RNA

01:04:56.730 --> 01:04:56.740
templated RNA synthesis you have an RNA
 

01:04:56.740 --> 01:04:58.470
templated RNA synthesis you have an RNA
template and the polymerase copies every

01:04:58.470 --> 01:04:58.480
template and the polymerase copies every
 

01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:00.510
template and the polymerase copies every
base it makes a faithful copy nan

01:05:00.510 --> 01:05:00.520
base it makes a faithful copy nan
 

01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:03.210
base it makes a faithful copy nan
template it is when it puts something in

01:05:03.210 --> 01:05:03.220
template it is when it puts something in
 

01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:05.460
template it is when it puts something in
that isn't in the template and so this

01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:05.470
that isn't in the template and so this
 

01:05:05.470 --> 01:05:08.069
that isn't in the template and so this
happens with measles and mumps virus

01:05:08.069 --> 01:05:08.079
happens with measles and mumps virus
 

01:05:08.079 --> 01:05:11.039
happens with measles and mumps virus
these are viruses with single negative

01:05:11.039 --> 01:05:11.049
these are viruses with single negative
 

01:05:11.049 --> 01:05:15.839
these are viruses with single negative
strand RNA genomes and from them the the

01:05:15.839 --> 01:05:15.849
strand RNA genomes and from them the the
 

01:05:15.849 --> 01:05:18.210
strand RNA genomes and from them the the
individual mRNAs are made when these

01:05:18.210 --> 01:05:18.220
individual mRNAs are made when these
 

01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:19.890
individual mRNAs are made when these
viruses come into salad remember there's

01:05:19.890 --> 01:05:19.900
viruses come into salad remember there's
 

01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:21.480
viruses come into salad remember there's
a polymerase in the particle that does

01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:21.490
a polymerase in the particle that does
 

01:05:21.490 --> 01:05:25.200
a polymerase in the particle that does
that all those mRNAs are faithful copies

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:25.210
that all those mRNAs are faithful copies
 

01:05:25.210 --> 01:05:26.099
that all those mRNAs are faithful copies
of the template

01:05:26.099 --> 01:05:26.109
of the template
 

01:05:26.109 --> 01:05:30.299
of the template
except here in this P mRNA it's a second

certain fraction of the time the

01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:35.200
certain fraction of the time the
 

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:37.739
certain fraction of the time the
polymerase inserts an extra base that's

01:05:37.739 --> 01:05:37.749
polymerase inserts an extra base that's
 

01:05:37.749 --> 01:05:41.220
polymerase inserts an extra base that's
not in the template and we're not sure

01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:41.230
not in the template and we're not sure
 

01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:44.880
not in the template and we're not sure
why but there's some kind of an RNA

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:44.890
why but there's some kind of an RNA
 

01:05:44.890 --> 01:05:46.559
why but there's some kind of an RNA
structure in this region we think the

01:05:46.559 --> 01:05:46.569
structure in this region we think the
 

01:05:46.569 --> 01:05:49.890
structure in this region we think the
polymerase bumps into it and makes a

01:05:49.890 --> 01:05:49.900
polymerase bumps into it and makes a
 

01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:52.229
polymerase bumps into it and makes a
mistake adds an extra base but in fact

01:05:52.229 --> 01:05:52.239
mistake adds an extra base but in fact
 

01:05:52.239 --> 01:05:54.749
mistake adds an extra base but in fact
it's beneficial for the virus because

01:05:54.749 --> 01:05:54.759
it's beneficial for the virus because
 

01:05:54.759 --> 01:05:56.729
it's beneficial for the virus because
not all not all the messenger RNAs have

01:05:56.729 --> 01:05:56.739
not all not all the messenger RNAs have
 

01:05:56.739 --> 01:05:59.039
not all not all the messenger RNAs have
this extra base but the ones that do can

01:05:59.039 --> 01:05:59.049
this extra base but the ones that do can
 

01:05:59.049 --> 01:06:01.950
this extra base but the ones that do can
make a different protein so here's a

01:06:01.950 --> 01:06:01.960
make a different protein so here's a
 

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:06.150
make a different protein so here's a
schematic of this here is the minus

01:06:06.150 --> 01:06:06.160
schematic of this here is the minus
 

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:08.160
schematic of this here is the minus
strand RNA template so normally it's

01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:08.170
strand RNA template so normally it's
 

01:06:08.170 --> 01:06:12.870
strand RNA template so normally it's
copied to make a faithful mRNA copy but

01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:12.880
copied to make a faithful mRNA copy but
 

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:15.720
copied to make a faithful mRNA copy but
some of the time then this extra G is

01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:15.730
some of the time then this extra G is
 

01:06:15.730 --> 01:06:18.599
some of the time then this extra G is
inserted here so again the polymerase

01:06:18.599 --> 01:06:18.609
inserted here so again the polymerase
 

01:06:18.609 --> 01:06:20.339
inserted here so again the polymerase
makes a mistake it makes a G here but

01:06:20.339 --> 01:06:20.349
makes a mistake it makes a G here but
 

01:06:20.349 --> 01:06:22.589
makes a mistake it makes a G here but
there's no G there's no seat templated

01:06:22.589 --> 01:06:22.599
there's no G there's no seat templated
 

01:06:22.599 --> 01:06:24.720
there's no G there's no seat templated
by that G on the negative strand

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:24.730
by that G on the negative strand
 

01:06:24.730 --> 01:06:26.609
by that G on the negative strand
template and then it resumes copying

01:06:26.609 --> 01:06:26.619
template and then it resumes copying
 

01:06:26.619 --> 01:06:28.799
template and then it resumes copying
downstream the net result is you have

01:06:28.799 --> 01:06:28.809
downstream the net result is you have
 

01:06:28.809 --> 01:06:31.620
downstream the net result is you have
one extra G in this mRNA that's not in

01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:31.630
one extra G in this mRNA that's not in
 

01:06:31.630 --> 01:06:32.999
one extra G in this mRNA that's not in
the template so that's what we mean by

01:06:32.999 --> 01:06:33.009
the template so that's what we mean by
 

01:06:33.009 --> 01:06:36.660
the template so that's what we mean by
non templated mRNA synthesis so the

01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:36.670
non templated mRNA synthesis so the
 

01:06:36.670 --> 01:06:39.599
non templated mRNA synthesis so the
result is that normally you have one

01:06:39.599 --> 01:06:39.609
result is that normally you have one
 

01:06:39.609 --> 01:06:42.749
result is that normally you have one
protein made from this normal mRNA which

01:06:42.749 --> 01:06:42.759
protein made from this normal mRNA which
 

01:06:42.759 --> 01:06:45.269
protein made from this normal mRNA which
is shown here but if you add an extra G

01:06:45.269 --> 01:06:45.279
is shown here but if you add an extra G
 

01:06:45.279 --> 01:06:48.599
is shown here but if you add an extra G
the the reading frame changes downstream

01:06:48.599 --> 01:06:48.609
the the reading frame changes downstream
 

01:06:48.609 --> 01:06:50.069
the the reading frame changes downstream
of the gene you get a different sequence

01:06:50.069 --> 01:06:50.079
of the gene you get a different sequence
 

01:06:50.079 --> 01:06:51.660
of the gene you get a different sequence
so this protein has a different C

01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:51.670
so this protein has a different C
 

01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:54.120
so this protein has a different C
terminal sequence from this one so you

01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:54.130
terminal sequence from this one so you
 

01:06:54.130 --> 01:06:56.130
terminal sequence from this one so you
can make two different proteins and in

01:06:56.130 --> 01:06:56.140
can make two different proteins and in
 

01:06:56.140 --> 01:06:58.859
can make two different proteins and in
fact these viruses depend on doing this

01:06:58.859 --> 01:06:58.869
fact these viruses depend on doing this
 

01:06:58.869 --> 01:07:01.190
fact these viruses depend on doing this
if you take this away they're not happy

01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:01.200
if you take this away they're not happy
 

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:04.519
if you take this away they're not happy
so it's another way of getting more

01:07:04.519 --> 01:07:04.529
so it's another way of getting more
 

01:07:04.529 --> 01:07:07.380
so it's another way of getting more
genetic information out of a single mRNA

01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:07.390
genetic information out of a single mRNA
 

01:07:07.390 --> 01:07:09.809
genetic information out of a single mRNA
you can see a number of tricks now that

01:07:09.809 --> 01:07:09.819
you can see a number of tricks now that
 

01:07:09.819 --> 01:07:16.160
you can see a number of tricks now that
have emerged to do this yes

01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:16.170
 

01:07:16.170 --> 01:07:19.940
what you asked it's not deliberate yeah

01:07:19.940 --> 01:07:19.950
what you asked it's not deliberate yeah
 

01:07:19.950 --> 01:07:21.140
what you asked it's not deliberate yeah
it appears to be because it's been

01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:21.150
it appears to be because it's been
 

01:07:21.150 --> 01:07:23.510
it appears to be because it's been
evolutionarily conserved it's not taken

01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:23.520
evolutionarily conserved it's not taken
 

01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:25.339
evolutionarily conserved it's not taken
away it makes the protein that has a

01:07:25.339 --> 01:07:25.349
away it makes the protein that has a
 

01:07:25.349 --> 01:07:27.950
away it makes the protein that has a
specific function yeah so the the

01:07:27.950 --> 01:07:27.960
specific function yeah so the the
 

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:29.539
specific function yeah so the the
replication scheme of this virus has

01:07:29.539 --> 01:07:29.549
replication scheme of this virus has
 

01:07:29.549 --> 01:07:40.030
replication scheme of this virus has
evolved to incorporate this

01:07:40.030 --> 01:07:40.040
 

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:42.100
you
