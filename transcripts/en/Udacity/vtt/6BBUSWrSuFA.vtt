00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.260
When I stretch out of the graph, I notice that I

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.758
get more of a cyclical pattern. It's almost like a sine or

00:00:05.758 --> 00:00:09.030
a cosine graph. And this makes sense with what the story

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.870
the data's telling. I mean, there are seasons in Nebraska, so we

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.580
should see fluctuation in the temperature every 12 months. This is

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.350
one example of how it's so important to get perspective on your

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.936
data. You want to make sure you put your data in

00:00:21.936 --> 00:00:25.520
context. Another important point to make here is that the proportion and

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.980
scale of your graphics do matter. Pioneers in the field of data visualization

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.890
such as Playfair and Tukey studied

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.240
this extensively. They determined that the nature

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.580
of the data should suggest the shape of the graphic. Otherwise, you should

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.690
tend to have a graphic that's about 50% wider than it is tall.
