he wants the glory as well and I think
 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.210 align:start position:0%

both<00:05:12.270><c> the</c><00:05:13.260><c> main</c><00:05:13.440><c> difference</c><00:05:13.830><c> I</c><00:05:13.950><c> think</c><00:05:14.130><c> the</c>

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 align:start position:0%
both the main difference I think the
 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.100 align:start position:0%
both the main difference I think the

this one good harsh heavy shadows uh but
 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.090 align:start position:0%
this one good harsh heavy shadows uh but
you<00:05:47.610><c> can</c><00:05:47.760><c> still</c><00:05:48.000><c> make</c><00:05:48.210><c> it</c><00:05:48.360><c> out</c><00:05:48.560><c> it's</c><00:05:49.560><c> not</c><00:05:49.800><c> so</c>

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 align:start position:0%
you can still make it out it's not so
 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.590 align:start position:0%
you can still make it out it's not so

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.150 align:start position:0%
bad that you know you're doing what's
going<00:05:51.750><c> out</c><00:05:51.990><c> what</c><00:05:52.169><c> you</c><00:05:52.260><c> can</c><00:05:52.410><c> still</c><00:05:52.680><c> make</c><00:05:52.890><c> it</c><00:05:53.040><c> out</c>

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
going out what you can still make it out
 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.330 align:start position:0%
going out what you can still make it out
and<00:05:54.060><c> it</c><00:05:54.210><c> just</c><00:05:54.240><c> makes</c><00:05:54.660><c> the</c><00:05:54.810><c> scenes</c><00:05:55.260><c> so</c><00:05:56.190><c> much</c>

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 align:start position:0%
and it just makes the scenes so much
 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.010 align:start position:0%
and it just makes the scenes so much
more<00:05:56.520><c> menacing</c><00:05:56.730><c> and</c><00:05:57.120><c> so</c><00:05:57.240><c> much</c><00:05:57.390><c> more</c><00:05:57.600><c> intense</c>

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 align:start position:0%
more menacing and so much more intense
 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:03.080 align:start position:0%
more menacing and so much more intense
um<00:06:00.110><c> so</c><00:06:01.110><c> the</c><00:06:01.530><c> other</c><00:06:01.980><c> thing</c><00:06:02.340><c> that</c><00:06:02.580><c> I</c><00:06:02.640><c> say</c><00:06:02.850><c> is</c>

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 align:start position:0%
um so the other thing that I say is
 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.180 align:start position:0%
um so the other thing that I say is
really<00:06:03.360><c> strong</c><00:06:03.540><c> in</c><00:06:03.720><c> this</c><00:06:03.840><c> one</c><00:06:04.080><c> that</c><00:06:04.410><c> again</c>

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 align:start position:0%
really strong in this one that again

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 align:start position:0%
realize it as well um I think Aang puts
 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:25.070 align:start position:0%
realize it as well um I think Aang puts
it<00:06:21.150><c> here</c><00:06:21.360><c> because</c><00:06:21.570><c> he</c><00:06:21.720><c> realizes</c><00:06:22.430><c> that</c><00:06:23.900><c> Zuko</c><00:06:24.900><c> is</c>

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
it here because he realizes that Zuko is
 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.040 align:start position:0%

get this kid out so he can claim him but
 

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:27.980 align:start position:0%
get this kid out so he can claim him but

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:27.990 align:start position:0%
also that they are working together um I
 

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:31.010 align:start position:0%
also that they are working together um I
think<00:08:28.260><c> the</c><00:08:28.620><c> action</c><00:08:29.160><c> the</c><00:08:29.480><c> longer</c><00:08:30.480><c> action</c><00:08:30.870><c> It</c>

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
think the action the longer action It
 

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.410 align:start position:0%
think the action the longer action It
Again<00:08:31.320><c> is</c><00:08:31.560><c> justified</c><00:08:32.340><c> I</c><00:08:32.370><c> think</c><00:08:32.970><c> it</c><00:08:33.060><c> actually</c>

00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
Again is justified I think it actually
 

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:35.780 align:start position:0%

really<00:08:33.690><c> works</c><00:08:34.080><c> and</c><00:08:34.410><c> it's</c><00:08:35.010><c> kind</c><00:08:35.280><c> of</c><00:08:35.430><c> needed</c>

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:35.790 align:start position:0%
really works and it's kind of needed
 

00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:37.730 align:start position:0%
really works and it's kind of needed
because<00:08:36.630><c> you</c><00:08:36.870><c> need</c><00:08:37.080><c> to</c><00:08:37.230><c> see</c><00:08:37.380><c> them</c><00:08:37.560><c> working</c>

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:37.740 align:start position:0%
because you need to see them working
 

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:40.130 align:start position:0%
