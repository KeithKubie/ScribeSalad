starting point for people to get a basic
framework and then go out beyond that

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180
framework and then go out beyond that
 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.299

see you know the growth of Wikipedia in
 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.700
see you know the growth of Wikipedia in
languages like Canada which is one of

languages like Canada which is one of
 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.760

the languages of India in in those
 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.889
the languages of India in in those
languages frequently the problem is not

an overload of information it's an
 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.759
an overload of information it's an
actual shortage of information there's

actual shortage of information there's
 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.760
actual shortage of information there's
very little material available to people

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770
very little material available to people
 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.800
very little material available to people
not so many books published not nearly

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810
not so many books published not nearly
 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.690
not so many books published not nearly
as many books translated into most

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700
as many books translated into most
 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.149
as many books translated into most

cheap easy source of information that's

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830
cheap easy source of information that's
 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.070
cheap easy source of information that's
available at all and so that's that's

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080
available at all and so that's that's
 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.929
available at all and so that's that's
pretty important I think it's really

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939
pretty important I think it's really

where there's very poor internet access
 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.340
where there's very poor internet access
and very you know low levels of literacy

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350
and very you know low levels of literacy
 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.560
and very you know low levels of literacy
and things like this that's really

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570
and things like this that's really
 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.880
and things like this that's really
really important and it's important that

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890
really important and it's important that
 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.289
really important and it's important that
people are able to do that without even

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299
people are able to do that without even
 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.120
people are able to do that without even
asking us they can just basically take

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130
asking us they can just basically take
 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.740
asking us they can just basically take
the content and redistribute it because

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750
the content and redistribute it because
 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.649
the content and redistribute it because
that's the license we put it out under

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659
that's the license we put it out under
 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.550
that's the license we put it out under
because I think that's going to have a

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560
because I think that's going to have a
 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:10.020
because I think that's going to have a
really big impact in law

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030
 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.640
well you know it comes out that it takes

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650
well you know it comes out that it takes
 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.530
well you know it comes out that it takes
a very small number of people

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540
a very small number of people
 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.199
a very small number of people
participating to generate quite a bit of

people would be enough to generate quite

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540
people would be enough to generate quite
 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.380
people would be enough to generate quite
a bit of work over a period of years so

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390
a bit of work over a period of years so
 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.750
a bit of work over a period of years so
a lot of this is going to come

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760
a lot of this is going to come
 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.970
a lot of this is going to come
organically a lot of this is going to

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980
organically a lot of this is going to
 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.930
organically a lot of this is going to
come as we see increasing penetration of

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940
come as we see increasing penetration of
 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.880
come as we see increasing penetration of
the internet access and different parts

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890
the internet access and different parts
 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.820
the internet access and different parts
of the world right now by typical

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830
of the world right now by typical
 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.380
of the world right now by typical
estimates there's around 1 billion

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390
estimates there's around 1 billion
 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.050
estimates there's around 1 billion
people online and it's estimated that in

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060
people online and it's estimated that in
 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.059
people online and it's estimated that in
the next five to 10 years we're going to

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069
the next five to 10 years we're going to
 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:08.890
the next five to 10 years we're going to
see the next billion people come online

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900
see the next billion people come online
 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.780
see the next billion people come online
well those next billion people are not

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790
well those next billion people are not
 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.520
well those next billion people are not
going to come online from the US and

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530
going to come online from the US and
 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.770
going to come online from the US and
Europe and Japan because we're all

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780
Europe and Japan because we're all
 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.990
Europe and Japan because we're all
pretty much online already they're

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000
pretty much online already they're
 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.800
pretty much online already they're
coming from South America huge boom and

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810
coming from South America huge boom and
 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.890
coming from South America huge boom and
Internet in places like Brazil from

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900
Internet in places like Brazil from
 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.069
Internet in places like Brazil from
Africa maybe a little slower India China

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079
Africa maybe a little slower India China
 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.350
Africa maybe a little slower India China
so people are coming online in droves

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360
so people are coming online in droves
 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.039
so people are coming online in droves
from you know non-english non-western

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049
from you know non-english non-western
 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:35.650
from you know non-english non-western
countries and they're going to be

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660
countries and they're going to be
 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.090
countries and they're going to be
adopting Wikipedia and they're going to

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100
adopting Wikipedia and they're going to
 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.620
adopting Wikipedia and they're going to
be building their own language versions

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630
be building their own language versions
 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.620
be building their own language versions
of Wikipedia so in terms of you know how

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630
of Wikipedia so in terms of you know how
 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.449
of Wikipedia so in terms of you know how
do we get it get it going there I think

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459
do we get it get it going there I think
 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.330
do we get it get it going there I think
a lot of it is outreach promotion

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340
a lot of it is outreach promotion
 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.590
a lot of it is outreach promotion
letting people know that it exists and

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600
letting people know that it exists and
 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.060
letting people know that it exists and
that that that they have an opportunity

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070
that that that they have an opportunity
 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:54.130
