00:00:10.858 --> 00:00:14.218
Diana: Maybe we shouldn't say this because
I haven't made any videos.

00:00:20.858 --> 00:00:26.218
Ellen: Hi, everyone, welcome to MoMA's live
Q&amp;A. I'm Ellen.

00:00:26.218 --> 00:00:27.018
Diana: And I'm Diana.

00:00:27.018 --> 00:00:30.378
Ellen: And we're both conservators here
at the Museum of Modern Art, which is where

00:00:30.378 --> 00:00:31.798
we're sitting.

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:36.658
We're actually in the painting side of the
painting and sculpture conservation studio.

00:00:36.658 --> 00:00:38.837
Painting is your field, right, Diana?

00:00:38.837 --> 00:00:40.848
Diana: Yeah, I specialize in paintings.

00:00:40.848 --> 00:00:47.447
Ellen: And I'm a sculpture conservator,
which means I take care of all of the three-dimensional

00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:49.638
works in MoMA's collection.

00:00:49.638 --> 00:00:53.968
And you can see sculpture is behind that glass
wall behind us where you can see all those

00:00:53.968 --> 00:00:58.198
robot arms coming down from the ceiling.

00:00:58.198 --> 00:01:02.917
We've been making videos for a while about
our work that you can see on MoMA's YouTube

00:01:02.917 --> 00:01:03.958
channel.

00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:07.838
And since we got such good questions in the
comment section, we decided to host this live

00:01:07.838 --> 00:01:12.337
Q&amp;A, to allow you to submit questions to us
directly.

00:01:12.337 --> 00:01:16.837
Diana: So we'll start off with some of your
questions submitted on the trailer and in

00:01:16.837 --> 00:01:17.837
past videos.

00:01:17.837 --> 00:01:22.548
Ellen: For those of you watching at home,
please, submit your questions to us live and

00:01:22.548 --> 00:01:27.368
our producers will pass them on to us during
the stream.

00:01:27.368 --> 00:01:29.188
So that's it for introductions.

00:01:29.188 --> 00:01:30.877
Let's start with the first question.

00:01:30.877 --> 00:01:31.877
Diana: Okay.

00:01:31.877 --> 00:01:34.228
Do you wanna grab it?

00:01:35.228 --> 00:01:39.667
So the first question is about conserving
a Frank Lloyd Wright statue.

00:01:39.667 --> 00:01:43.508
Shelby, asks, "How did you get the job?"

00:01:43.508 --> 00:01:47.638
What schooling is required to become a restoration
technician?

00:01:47.638 --> 00:01:48.828
I want to do that for a living."

00:01:48.828 --> 00:01:54.298
Ellen: And then we have another question
it's sort of similar, right, from Niet Tove,

00:01:54.298 --> 00:01:55.638
I don't know how to pronounce that.

00:01:55.647 --> 00:01:59.378
"How did you become a conservator?"

00:01:59.378 --> 00:02:04.207
So maybe we should work backward from that
question and discuss what we do as conservators

00:02:04.207 --> 00:02:05.688
and then how we got here.

00:02:05.688 --> 00:02:07.068
Diana: Sounds good.

00:02:07.068 --> 00:02:14.118
Ellen: So, as conservators, we take care
of works in the collection and that can include

00:02:14.118 --> 00:02:21.338
treatment like reactive treatment of a work
like cleaning and repairing.

00:02:21.338 --> 00:02:27.578
But it can also be proactive work, like I'm
doing preventive… taking preventive measures

00:02:27.578 --> 00:02:32.988
like advising on crates for transport or whether
a work needs a stanchion or.

00:02:32.988 --> 00:02:38.058
Diana: Or controlling the environment that's
surrounding the artwork.

00:02:38.058 --> 00:02:40.158
Ellen: Right.

00:02:40.158 --> 00:02:45.538
And to get to where we are today, you need
some training.

00:02:45.538 --> 00:02:50.328
There are a handful of training programs in
the country.

00:02:50.328 --> 00:02:55.728
We went to the University of Delaware, but
there are a few others on the East Coast and

00:02:55.728 --> 00:02:58.207
West Coast too.

00:02:58.207 --> 00:03:05.547
And to get into these programs, you need to
have a combination of training in science,

00:03:05.547 --> 00:03:09.008
humanities, art history and studio art.

00:03:09.008 --> 00:03:19.667
Diana: Yes, and we both went to University
of Delaware so I guess how I started in the

00:03:19.667 --> 00:03:24.748
field was actually selling tickets at an art
museum and working the coat-check.

00:03:24.748 --> 00:03:31.978
And I just started applying for any job related
within the museum, related to conservation

00:03:31.978 --> 00:03:37.158
and eventually, I applied for one job, which
I didn't get.

00:03:37.158 --> 00:03:41.158
And then they called me back a few months
later that there was another project and I

00:03:41.158 --> 00:03:48.008
got that job and it was for a studio or a
storage move into new storage.

00:03:48.008 --> 00:03:54.318
And so I think just as long as you start in
the arts and just keep going from there.

00:03:54.318 --> 00:03:55.318
Yeah.

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:58.118
How did you start?

00:03:58.118 --> 00:04:00.397
Ellen: That's cool.

00:04:00.397 --> 00:04:08.447
I started... well, I come from sort of privileged
position because my mother worked at a museum

00:04:08.447 --> 00:04:10.908
so I always knew conservation existed.

00:04:10.908 --> 00:04:12.508
Which is like half the battle, I think.

00:04:12.508 --> 00:04:16.188
A lot of people have never heard of art conservation.

00:04:16.188 --> 00:04:24.558
And I grew up in California so when the Northridge
earthquake hit in 1994, I derived a lot of

00:04:24.558 --> 00:04:31.038
pleasure out of putting together little tchotchkes
that had fallen apart in my house.

00:04:31.038 --> 00:04:35.788
So that's sort of when the seed was planted
and I sort of buried it for a while and went

00:04:35.788 --> 00:04:37.298
on to study other things.

00:04:37.298 --> 00:04:43.128
But my junior year of college, the idea came
back to me I was doing a lot of art history.

00:04:43.128 --> 00:04:47.428
But I knew I didn't wanna be an art historian
and I took a lot of studio classes, but I

00:04:47.428 --> 00:04:50.308
didn't wanna be an artist either.

00:04:50.308 --> 00:04:54.978
So this seemed like a really nice way to combine
both of those interests.

00:04:54.978 --> 00:05:01.499
Diana: And as far as schooling, before you
get into one of the graduate programs, so

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:10.098
in America, there's four different programs
and they require that you have art history,

00:05:10.098 --> 00:05:12.678
studio art, and chemistry.

00:05:12.678 --> 00:05:16.568
And so you do to do quite a bit of that work
before you get into school.

00:05:16.568 --> 00:05:24.688
A good idea is to while you're doing all your
prerequisite schoolwork to get a job related

00:05:24.688 --> 00:05:29.738
to art conservation or an internship so you
also need a lot of practical experience.

00:05:29.738 --> 00:05:35.768
So if you do them at the same time, you'll
be better set when you apply to the schools.

00:05:35.768 --> 00:05:39.658
Ellen: Should we go for the next question?

00:05:39.658 --> 00:05:40.778
Diana: Yeah.

00:05:40.778 --> 00:05:42.448
Ellen: Let's see.

00:05:42.448 --> 00:05:46.758
Fudi Fickenscher says, "I'm a high school
student.

00:05:46.758 --> 00:05:49.608
How did you get started in conservation and
get experiences?"

00:05:49.608 --> 00:05:51.898
That's a related question.

00:05:51.898 --> 00:05:58.188
Diana: And I think we were talking about
this earlier and just go visit conservation

00:05:58.188 --> 00:05:59.188
studios.

00:05:59.188 --> 00:06:03.958
Look up studios in your area, If you're on
vacation, look up studios wherever you are

00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:07.658
and just call them or email and see if you
can go for a visit.

00:06:07.658 --> 00:06:10.468
Ellen: Yeah, you can find conservators in
your area and I agree.

00:06:10.468 --> 00:06:16.408
I think that's the best way is to meet conservators
and talk to them about the job and see if

00:06:16.408 --> 00:06:18.228
it's actually appealing.

00:06:18.228 --> 00:06:23.308
And that's…I think it's really…it's important
to get a little bit experienced in conservation

00:06:23.308 --> 00:06:27.528
before you start collecting their prerequisites
to make sure that you're suited for it because

00:06:27.528 --> 00:06:29.138
it's not for everybody.

00:06:29.138 --> 00:06:33.818
But to find conservators in your area, you
can call institutions that have conservation

00:06:33.818 --> 00:06:34.978
departments.

00:06:34.978 --> 00:06:40.988
You can also go to the AIC website, the American
Institute of Conservation, and find a conservator.

00:06:40.988 --> 00:06:46.018
You can do a location-based search to find
conservators there in your area and then invite

00:06:46.018 --> 00:06:47.368
them out to coffee.

00:06:47.368 --> 00:06:49.708
Say you wanna rack their brains,

00:06:49.708 --> 00:06:50.868
Diana: Bring them cookies

00:06:50.868 --> 00:06:55.058
Ellen: say you wanna see their labs, their
studio spaces.

00:06:55.058 --> 00:07:01.438
And that can often lead to experience and
at the very least, an expanded network, which

00:07:01.438 --> 00:07:03.238
is good in any field.

00:07:03.238 --> 00:07:05.038
Diana: So next question.

00:07:05.038 --> 00:07:09.588
Ellen: I think we have some live questions,

00:07:09.588 --> 00:07:10.678
producer just gave us.

00:07:10.678 --> 00:07:11.678
All right.

00:07:11.678 --> 00:07:12.678
Let's see.

00:07:12.678 --> 00:07:16.637
Bennett Clarkson, "How do you determine which
pieces are conserved or restored?

00:07:16.637 --> 00:07:20.248
What role do the curators play in the process
if any?"

00:07:20.248 --> 00:07:24.778
Diana: That's a really good question.

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:32.758
There's a few different ways that artwork
comes to our labs, our studios.

00:07:32.758 --> 00:07:38.758
One way is if there's an exhibition that the
artwork will be traveling to a different city,

00:07:38.758 --> 00:07:39.918
a different museum.

00:07:39.918 --> 00:07:48.158
They'll come into our studio so we can check
them and possibly do treatment if necessary,

00:07:48.158 --> 00:07:49.918
but there's other ways too.

00:07:49.918 --> 00:07:54.488
Ellen: Yeah, if a work is slated for loan

00:07:54.488 --> 00:07:58.868
or exhibition, we're a very exhibition-driven
museum, those will be the works that come

00:07:58.868 --> 00:08:00.698
to our bench.

00:08:00.698 --> 00:08:06.229
And deciding whether to... okay, conservation
and restoration, I guess, are two different

00:08:06.229 --> 00:08:07.229
things.

00:08:07.229 --> 00:08:08.229
Maybe we should tackle that.

00:08:08.229 --> 00:08:09.229
Diana: Yeah.

00:08:09.229 --> 00:08:11.158
Ellen: So to conserve an object, it's like…I

00:08:11.158 --> 00:08:13.827
guess it's a more holistic phrase now.

00:08:13.827 --> 00:08:16.928
It can include restoration, but it's forward-looking.

00:08:16.928 --> 00:08:19.457
You're trying to preserve what's already there.

00:08:19.457 --> 00:08:22.827
And technically, we're doing that for our
entire collection.

00:08:22.827 --> 00:08:26.878
That's MoMA's mission, to preserve its collection.

00:08:26.878 --> 00:08:30.508
So as conservators at MoMA, we conserve the
whole collection.

00:08:30.508 --> 00:08:37.087
And we do that, like Diana mentioned before,
with a lot of passive means, making sure everything's

00:08:37.087 --> 00:08:41.248
stored correctly, that the environments are
controlled, so on and so forth.

00:08:41.248 --> 00:08:48.008
But then restoration, you're returning a work
to a previous condition.

00:08:48.008 --> 00:08:53.377
And that can involve lost compensation, like
in painting or retouching.

00:08:53.377 --> 00:08:58.317
And determining which pieces get restored
is sort of a bigger question.

00:08:58.317 --> 00:09:01.298
And that, curators play a pivotal role.

00:09:01.298 --> 00:09:04.178
If there's a piece that they wanna show and
they're not happy with the condition or they

00:09:04.178 --> 00:09:09.767
think the condition is distracting in some
way to the presentation they want to make,

00:09:09.767 --> 00:09:11.987
then we will discuss options for restoration.

00:09:11.987 --> 00:09:13.348
Diana: Definitely.

00:09:13.348 --> 00:09:18.788
Should we go for another one of these?

00:09:18.788 --> 00:09:20.147
Ellen: Yeah.

00:09:20.147 --> 00:09:21.507
Diana: Okay.

00:09:21.507 --> 00:09:29.408
So this question is about the Yves Klein painting
that was restored by our colleague, Ellen

00:09:29.408 --> 00:09:32.488
Davis, brilliant colleague, Ellen Davis, who
we...

00:09:32.488 --> 00:09:34.618
Ellen: We lost to the Harvard Art Museum's

00:09:34.618 --> 00:09:35.618
but.

00:09:35.618 --> 00:09:37.277
Diana: Hi, Ellen.

00:09:37.277 --> 00:09:41.277
Ellen: Hi, Ellen, we miss you.

00:09:41.277 --> 00:09:43.947
Diana: We miss you.

00:09:43.947 --> 00:09:47.288
Ellen: Very happy for you.

00:09:47.288 --> 00:09:49.957
Diana: We miss you.

00:09:49.957 --> 00:09:52.587
So this question comes from a name I cannot
pronounce.

00:09:52.587 --> 00:09:53.587
Ellen: Dsibthorpe.

00:09:53.587 --> 00:09:54.598
Diana: Dsibthorpe says, "To borrow a phrase

00:09:54.598 --> 00:09:59.327
from conservation biology, 'conserved to what
era?'

00:09:59.327 --> 00:10:04.418
As an evolutionary biologist, I would say
leave it be, let it evolve."

00:10:04.418 --> 00:10:05.807
It's a good question.

00:10:05.807 --> 00:10:07.598
Ellen: Conserve to what era?

00:10:07.598 --> 00:10:13.507
It's fun to hear from a conservation biologist
because I feel like if you go to a cocktail

00:10:13.507 --> 00:10:17.647
party and you say you're a conservator, everybody
thinks that you're conserving wildlife and

00:10:17.647 --> 00:10:18.647
trees.

00:10:18.647 --> 00:10:20.327
You know, they think you're a conservationist.

00:10:20.327 --> 00:10:22.231
You can have to explain, no, it's an art conservator.

00:10:22.231 --> 00:10:29.428
So it's fun to hear from somebody from that
actual field, it seems, evolutionary biologist.

00:10:29.428 --> 00:10:30.957
Conserve to what era?

00:10:30.957 --> 00:10:38.217
That is a question we certainly grapple with
as art conservators.

00:10:38.217 --> 00:10:40.418
And I think the implication is that anything

00:10:40.418 --> 00:10:47.187
we do to an object is necessarily interpretive
where we bring with us our own biases.

00:10:47.187 --> 00:10:56.187
And we'll make decisions that result in the
ultimate…how the work is presented ultimately

00:10:56.187 --> 00:11:01.408
and that reflects who we are at this time
and not... it isn't some overarching truth

00:11:01.408 --> 00:11:02.818
that we're trying to reach.

00:11:02.818 --> 00:11:08.768
So I think keeping that in mind and knowing
we can't escape our own biases, I don't think

00:11:08.768 --> 00:11:15.207
that means we should abstain from conserving
because there are some cases where you really

00:11:15.207 --> 00:11:17.397
have to intervene in some way, right?

00:11:17.397 --> 00:11:21.077
Diana: Yeah, and sometimes we intervene invisibly.

00:11:21.077 --> 00:11:28.738
So some artworks need to be stabilized and
I would say that's a much more common treatment

00:11:28.738 --> 00:11:35.558
than a full treatment that changes the appearance
of an artwork.

00:11:35.558 --> 00:11:44.717
And so yeah, so I feel like we…if we let
everything evolve, we would be left with no

00:11:44.717 --> 00:11:46.638
cultural heritage so…

00:11:46.638 --> 00:11:49.488
Ellen: Yeah, if we took a completely passive

00:11:49.488 --> 00:11:56.478
approach, I think we wouldn't be able to show
as much as them as we show today at the Museum.

00:11:56.478 --> 00:12:01.887
But that is certainly one of the options that
we consider when we're considering restoring

00:12:01.887 --> 00:12:02.887
a work.

00:12:02.887 --> 00:12:07.248
Doing nothing is a form of a decision you
make in conservation too.

00:12:07.248 --> 00:12:08.807
Diana: Yeah, and we work reversibly.

00:12:08.807 --> 00:12:09.807
Ellen: Right.

00:12:09.807 --> 00:12:12.467
Diana: Or we try to make everything at least

00:12:12.467 --> 00:12:14.967
retreatable, which is...

00:12:14.967 --> 00:12:16.928
Ellen: To allow those future generations.

00:12:16.928 --> 00:12:17.928
Diana: Yeah.

00:12:17.928 --> 00:12:19.788
Ellen: If they have different ideas about

00:12:19.788 --> 00:12:24.247
how something should be presented, they can
alter what we've done.

00:12:24.247 --> 00:12:25.867
So yeah.

00:12:25.867 --> 00:12:27.487
Diana: Exactly.

00:12:27.487 --> 00:12:29.188
Ellen: Good question.

00:12:29.188 --> 00:12:31.888
Diana: Good question.

00:12:31.888 --> 00:12:37.288
Ellen: Zodiac Josh asks, "How much conservation

00:12:37.288 --> 00:12:39.168
is too much?

00:12:39.168 --> 00:12:42.478
When is it no longer feasible to restore a
piece?

00:12:42.478 --> 00:12:47.087
Is it still the original artwork if it has
been heavily restored?

00:12:47.087 --> 00:12:49.087
Maybe more of a philosophical question."

00:12:49.087 --> 00:12:54.738
Indeed it's actually more of more like three
philosophical questions.

00:12:54.738 --> 00:12:56.077
How much conservation is too much?

00:12:56.077 --> 00:12:57.857
I think he's talking about loss compensation.

00:12:57.857 --> 00:12:59.027
Diana: Yeah, I think so.

00:12:59.027 --> 00:13:00.207
Ellen: Not conservation, per se.

00:13:00.207 --> 00:13:01.207
Diana: Yeah.

00:13:01.207 --> 00:13:02.207
Ellen: He's talking about like…

00:13:02.207 --> 00:13:03.207
Diana: Yeah.

00:13:03.207 --> 00:13:05.267
Ellen: Retouching or introducing some new

00:13:05.267 --> 00:13:08.108
material into a work.

00:13:08.108 --> 00:13:10.238
So how much is too much?

00:13:10.238 --> 00:13:12.038
What do you think?

00:13:12.038 --> 00:13:13.777
Diana: So the monkey Jesus.

00:13:13.777 --> 00:13:14.777
Ellen: That's too much.

00:13:14.777 --> 00:13:16.587
Diana: That's too much and we don't do that

00:13:16.587 --> 00:13:17.587
here.

00:13:17.587 --> 00:13:18.587
Ellen: Basically, Jesus in Spain.

00:13:18.587 --> 00:13:19.587
Diana: Yes, no we.

00:13:19.587 --> 00:13:20.587
Ellen: Two thousand and twelve.

00:13:20.587 --> 00:13:22.378
Diana: Yeah, we don't…look it up if you

00:13:22.378 --> 00:13:23.378
haven't seen it.

00:13:23.378 --> 00:13:25.767
We don't do that here.

00:13:25.767 --> 00:13:31.427
So we try not to cover any original material.

00:13:31.427 --> 00:13:38.027
We are trained, you know, to do pretty precise
work.

00:13:38.027 --> 00:13:47.808
We don't...we do little tests, we use reversible
materials, so for the most part, I think although

00:13:47.808 --> 00:13:50.897
this is a good question and we battle with
the ethics…

00:13:50.897 --> 00:13:53.118
Ellen: How much conservation is too much?

00:13:53.118 --> 00:13:54.118
Diana: How much?

00:13:54.118 --> 00:13:58.037
I think we're trained to do a less is more
approach now.

00:13:58.037 --> 00:14:02.618
Ellen: Yeah, definitely and I think, you know,

00:14:02.618 --> 00:14:08.418
we talk about people who are predecessors
of like 20 or 30 years doing these conservation

00:14:08.418 --> 00:14:09.418
treatments.

00:14:09.418 --> 00:14:15.217
Which now, we are backing out of and undoing
and who knows what the next, the future generations

00:14:15.217 --> 00:14:19.627
will be doing with our bits of restoration.

00:14:19.627 --> 00:14:26.598
But yeah, like we said in the previous question,
we try to work in a way that can be revisited.

00:14:26.598 --> 00:14:32.957
When is it no longer feasible to restore a
piece?

00:14:32.957 --> 00:14:37.277
I don't...I haven't really faced that here.

00:14:37.277 --> 00:14:38.277
Diana: Yeah.

00:14:38.277 --> 00:14:39.598
Ellen: I guess that the paintings from the

00:14:39.598 --> 00:14:42.397
MoMA fire that are so far gone that…

00:14:42.397 --> 00:14:43.908
Diana: Yeah.

00:14:43.908 --> 00:14:46.728
Ellen: …restoring them in their current

00:14:46.728 --> 00:14:49.077
state is not really possible.

00:14:49.077 --> 00:14:53.887
I guess, yeah.

00:14:53.887 --> 00:14:59.118
And I guess in that way, it's not really feasible
because it's not It can't be successful.

00:14:59.118 --> 00:15:06.207
If you feel like the restoration is undermining
the integrity or the authenticity of the work,

00:15:06.207 --> 00:15:09.647
maybe it's no longer feasible.

00:15:09.647 --> 00:15:17.077
For the most part, we're museums works that
can be treated if they're not already in amazing

00:15:17.077 --> 00:15:19.798
condition so makes it easier on us.

00:15:19.798 --> 00:15:22.827
Should we take a live question?

00:15:22.827 --> 00:15:31.038
All right, Run for Life says, "I'm a pastel
artist and I'd love to know if they are hard

00:15:31.038 --> 00:15:32.098
to restore?

00:15:32.098 --> 00:15:38.348
Any tips to help pastel works last longer
or materials you want to stay away from?"

00:15:38.348 --> 00:15:43.137
Diana: I think for this question, a general

00:15:43.137 --> 00:15:50.178
piece of advice would be how you store your
artwork after you've made it is really important.

00:15:50.178 --> 00:15:53.158
You definitely don't want to keep it in a
leaky basement.

00:15:53.158 --> 00:15:56.408
For a pastel, that would be awful.

00:15:56.408 --> 00:16:02.697
You wanna keep your artwork away from bright
sunlight, in an interior room if possible.

00:16:02.697 --> 00:16:03.797
Ellen: Heat.

00:16:03.797 --> 00:16:07.868
Diana: No heat, no pets jumping on your art.

00:16:07.868 --> 00:16:09.198
That happens a lot.

00:16:09.198 --> 00:16:10.807
Ellen: No moisture.

00:16:10.807 --> 00:16:12.418
Diana: No moisture.

00:16:12.418 --> 00:16:15.137
So that's one really important aspect.

00:16:15.137 --> 00:16:19.668
Also, using good quality materials, if you
can, helps.

00:16:19.668 --> 00:16:26.507
But obviously, not everyone can use the highest
quality, expensive materials.

00:16:26.507 --> 00:16:30.998
So just maybe research the best way to use
those materials.

00:16:30.998 --> 00:16:33.757
Ellen: And other materials that you wanna

00:16:33.757 --> 00:16:34.757
stay away from?

00:16:34.757 --> 00:16:36.557
What do you...?

00:16:36.557 --> 00:16:37.777
Diana: I…no.

00:16:37.777 --> 00:16:38.997
Ellen: Fixatives?

00:16:38.997 --> 00:16:41.498
Diana: Oh, yeah, maybe fixatives.

00:16:41.498 --> 00:16:42.668
Ellen: I mean.

00:16:42.668 --> 00:16:43.837
Diana: Well, no.

00:16:43.837 --> 00:16:44.837
Ellen: Pro/con I mean.

00:16:44.837 --> 00:16:45.837
Diana: Yeah.

00:16:45.837 --> 00:16:46.978
Ellen: They might yellow over time, but they

00:16:46.978 --> 00:16:52.818
will help hold the pigment to the paper.

00:16:52.818 --> 00:16:53.818
Diana: Yeah.

00:16:53.818 --> 00:16:54.818
Ellen: It feels constricting to tell an artist

00:16:54.818 --> 00:16:57.397
to avoid certain materials, in a way.

00:16:57.397 --> 00:17:05.498
Some of our most interesting art combines
materials that weren't meant to go together

00:17:05.498 --> 00:17:08.158
so just have at it, Run for Life.

00:17:08.158 --> 00:17:09.158
Diana: Yeah.

00:17:09.158 --> 00:17:10.158
Ellen: Just have fun.

00:17:10.158 --> 00:17:11.338
Diana: Keep pets away.

00:17:11.338 --> 00:17:16.018
Ellen: Keep pets away, but have fun.

00:17:16.018 --> 00:17:18.028
Diana: Have fun.

00:17:18.028 --> 00:17:25.088
Oh, this is a question we previewed earlier,
"Why are some of the individuals in this feature

00:17:25.088 --> 00:17:28.338
wearing gloves while handling art and others
are not?"

00:17:28.338 --> 00:17:31.918
Ellen: This was at our "At the Museum" episode

00:17:31.918 --> 00:17:37.747
one and it showed some of our conservators
working on objects.

00:17:37.747 --> 00:17:44.628
Our intern, Jessica Chasen, working on Kusama's
accumulation without any gloves and that's

00:17:44.628 --> 00:17:47.997
painted, upholstered chair.

00:17:47.997 --> 00:17:53.918
And then it showed other people, mostly preparators,
wearing gloves as they prepared works to go

00:17:53.918 --> 00:17:58.068
to the Louis Vuitton Foundation.

00:17:58.068 --> 00:18:01.018
So gloves, why do we wear gloves?

00:18:01.018 --> 00:18:05.467
Diana: So sometimes, we wear gloves to protect

00:18:05.467 --> 00:18:10.847
the artwork while, other times, we wear gloves
to protect ourselves.

00:18:10.847 --> 00:18:17.178
So some artworks, such as metals, you should
never touch without gloves because the oil

00:18:17.178 --> 00:18:22.357
from your hands can leave a mark, a permanent
mark on the surfaces.

00:18:22.357 --> 00:18:27.188
But other works, maybe something that contains
lead or something that contains something

00:18:27.188 --> 00:18:31.188
we shouldn't be touching, we wanna wear gloves
to protect ourselves.

00:18:31.188 --> 00:18:37.008
But there's plenty of things like Jessica,
in the video, isn't wearing gloves because

00:18:37.008 --> 00:18:39.748
that material is okay for her to touch.

00:18:39.748 --> 00:18:46.048
And sometimes, you need the dexterity of your
fingers without gloves in order to do this

00:18:46.048 --> 00:18:47.828
fine, detailed work that we do.

00:18:47.828 --> 00:18:50.698
Ellen: Yeah, gloves can mask and make it a

00:18:50.698 --> 00:18:56.028
little bit more crude, the way that you work
and sometimes you need to wear them to protect

00:18:56.028 --> 00:18:58.278
yourself or the artwork.

00:18:58.278 --> 00:19:03.298
But often times, clean hands are preferable
to gloved hands.

00:19:03.298 --> 00:19:05.327
And not all gloves are created equal.

00:19:05.327 --> 00:19:08.778
We use nitrile gloves, for the most part,
here.

00:19:08.778 --> 00:19:13.148
That's a fairly stable rubber.

00:19:13.148 --> 00:19:17.837
Other gloves, like latex gloves that have
powders on them, some gloves are much too

00:19:17.837 --> 00:19:19.548
thick to handle objects.

00:19:19.548 --> 00:19:23.138
And so we need to choose our gloves like we
do any tool carefully.

00:19:23.138 --> 00:19:24.138
Diana: Good question.

00:19:24.138 --> 00:19:26.977
Ellen: Yeah, that's a great question.

00:19:26.977 --> 00:19:30.508
Should we take another live question?

00:19:30.508 --> 00:19:31.508
Diana: Yeah.

00:19:31.508 --> 00:19:32.598
Ellen: Let's see.

00:19:32.598 --> 00:19:37.398
Naomi Silver, says, "Do you ever get nervous
working on such a valuable art?

00:19:37.398 --> 00:19:39.487
"What happens if you make a mistake?

00:19:39.487 --> 00:19:43.888
Is it stressful or relaxing doing such meticulous
work?"

00:19:43.888 --> 00:19:45.438
Diana: That's a really good question.

00:19:45.438 --> 00:19:48.538
Ellen: Yeah, Naomi, it seems like she knows

00:19:48.538 --> 00:19:50.117
some conservators.

00:19:50.117 --> 00:19:54.958
Diana: Yeah, I mean, I think, obviously, a

00:19:54.958 --> 00:19:57.558
healthy amount of fear is always good.

00:19:57.558 --> 00:19:58.658
Ellen: Right.

00:19:58.658 --> 00:20:00.798
Diana: You don't ever wanna be too cocky while

00:20:00.798 --> 00:20:10.158
handling precious artwork, but also we handle
so much art here that you get to a certain

00:20:10.158 --> 00:20:12.308
level of comfort, I would say.

00:20:12.308 --> 00:20:13.308
Ellen: Right.

00:20:13.308 --> 00:20:14.308
All true.

00:20:14.308 --> 00:20:16.148
Diana: So it's not stressful.

00:20:16.148 --> 00:20:19.458
It can be very relaxing, actually.

00:20:19.458 --> 00:20:25.128
Sometimes, repetitive motions and really just
doing the same thing, like rubbing a swab

00:20:25.128 --> 00:20:28.548
over a surface for a few hours, is kind of
therapeutic.

00:20:28.548 --> 00:20:30.768
Ellen: Yeah, I know it's great I love that

00:20:30.768 --> 00:20:31.768
kind of work.

00:20:31.768 --> 00:20:33.208
Diana: I love it.

00:20:33.208 --> 00:20:38.558
Yeah, so I would say it's more times relaxing
than stressful.

00:20:38.558 --> 00:20:40.197
Ellen: Definitely.

00:20:40.197 --> 00:20:47.758
And to the mistake question, I think we work
in such a way that we manage risk so we wouldn't

00:20:47.758 --> 00:20:53.568
be like trying a new solvent over the face
of a painting with these big broad brushstrokes.

00:20:53.568 --> 00:20:59.758
We work in very small, discreet areas and
always test our materials so the types of

00:20:59.758 --> 00:21:03.018
mistakes that we can make are pretty limited.

00:21:03.018 --> 00:21:06.568
Diana: I would say most of the time, we're

00:21:06.568 --> 00:21:10.518
fixing mistakes rather than making them.

00:21:10.518 --> 00:21:13.408
Ellen: Yeah, conservators don't make mistakes.

00:21:13.408 --> 00:21:17.938
It's everybody else and then we take care
of your mistakes, yeah.

00:21:17.938 --> 00:21:23.568
But no, that's like that's a problem with
our field because it's really hard for a conservator

00:21:23.568 --> 00:21:28.747
to admit they've made a mistake because it
seems like we might come across as clumsy

00:21:28.747 --> 00:21:32.727
or misinformed.

00:21:32.727 --> 00:21:34.737
It can be a little damning.

00:21:34.737 --> 00:21:35.737
Diana: Yeah.

00:21:35.737 --> 00:21:38.668
Ellen: And that's a shame because fields learn

00:21:38.668 --> 00:21:39.928
from their mistakes.

00:21:39.928 --> 00:21:45.278
So there has been a conscious effort, I think,
within the field to be a little bit more transparent

00:21:45.278 --> 00:21:48.318
about mistakes that are made.

00:21:48.318 --> 00:21:55.378
But again, like, the vast majority of those
mistakes are totally reversible because yeah

00:21:55.378 --> 00:21:57.768
because we work in sort of a reversible way,
right?

00:21:57.768 --> 00:22:00.378
Diana: Yeah, and we do so much testing before

00:22:00.378 --> 00:22:08.977
we even touch the artwork in an overall sense
that if a mistake happens, it's early on in

00:22:08.977 --> 00:22:10.578
testing stages.

00:22:10.578 --> 00:22:12.597
Ellen: Yeah.

00:22:12.597 --> 00:22:15.638
Ellen: Yeah, sure.

00:22:15.638 --> 00:22:17.538
Whatever you want.

00:22:17.538 --> 00:22:21.058
Diana: I got two.

00:22:21.058 --> 00:22:22.058
Okay.

00:22:22.058 --> 00:22:28.948
So Zoey asks…and this is from "At the Museum"
episode one video, "Is that a special flashlight

00:22:28.948 --> 00:22:30.487
they keep using?

00:22:30.487 --> 00:22:33.697
Does it use a different hue or wavelength
of light?

00:22:33.697 --> 00:22:35.378
It's an odd looking flashlight."

00:22:35.378 --> 00:22:43.668
So we brought some of these odd-looking flashlights
for you to look at.

00:22:43.668 --> 00:22:48.648
Ellen: So that's the one she was just...in

00:22:48.648 --> 00:22:49.648
the video right?

00:22:49.648 --> 00:22:52.558
Diana: Yeah, so this is…these are just two

00:22:52.558 --> 00:22:54.617
different types of flashlights we use.

00:22:54.617 --> 00:23:02.528
This is just a regular flashlight, a good
intensity to look at surfaces of objects,

00:23:02.528 --> 00:23:06.138
to look for damages and things like that.

00:23:06.138 --> 00:23:10.587
And Ellen's holding a UV flashlight.

00:23:10.587 --> 00:23:12.837
So this tells us different types of information.

00:23:12.837 --> 00:23:16.648
Ellen: Yeah, shining a UV light on a surface

00:23:16.648 --> 00:23:20.348
will give you information you can't see with
regular light.

00:23:20.348 --> 00:23:22.407
Sorry, UV radiation.

00:23:22.407 --> 00:23:23.778
Diana: Radiation.

00:23:23.778 --> 00:23:31.597
Ellen: Yeah, so yeah, with a UV, do you call

00:23:31.597 --> 00:23:33.178
it a radiator then?

00:23:33.178 --> 00:23:34.178
It's radiation.

00:23:34.178 --> 00:23:38.008
The UV torch, you can see, like, things that
you can't see a normal light.

00:23:38.008 --> 00:23:45.098
Like I said, like past retouching or a varnish
that's been applied is transparent in regular

00:23:45.098 --> 00:23:46.098
light.

00:23:46.098 --> 00:23:49.298
And I really…I love this style flashlight
and there are other flashlights out there

00:23:49.298 --> 00:23:54.878
on the market and there's nothing particularly
special about this design.

00:23:54.878 --> 00:24:00.117
But I think it's…it really helps look at
vertical surfaces you don't have to like tilt

00:24:00.117 --> 00:24:02.658
your wrist in a weird way if you're using
a more traditional torch.

00:24:02.658 --> 00:24:06.927
Diana: Yeah, this a good shape for us.

00:24:06.927 --> 00:24:09.178
Ellen: What other tools do we have here?

00:24:09.178 --> 00:24:10.178
Diana: Let's see.

00:24:10.178 --> 00:24:11.178
So…

00:24:11.178 --> 00:24:13.108
Ellen: Do you want to just bring this forward?

00:24:13.108 --> 00:24:14.108
Diana: Yeah.

00:24:14.108 --> 00:24:15.528
Ellen: Oh, my God, that's heavy.

00:24:15.528 --> 00:24:16.528
It has weight in it.

00:24:16.528 --> 00:24:17.837
Diana: It has weights in it.

00:24:17.837 --> 00:24:25.178
So people ask us about tools a lot so we thought
we'd show you a couple of our favorite tools.

00:24:25.178 --> 00:24:29.467
For example, a dental pick.

00:24:29.467 --> 00:24:32.038
We borrow a lot from other professions.

00:24:32.038 --> 00:24:40.607
There's very few things…there's a few things,
but very few things we use just made for conservators.

00:24:40.607 --> 00:24:44.918
So different types of dental picks are our
favorite things.

00:24:44.918 --> 00:24:50.688
Ellen: Tiny brushes for in painting and retouching

00:24:50.688 --> 00:24:58.188
but also for filling fine cracks with a filling
compound or seeping adhesive under lifting

00:24:58.188 --> 00:24:59.948
paint, one of my favorite activities.

00:24:59.948 --> 00:25:05.928
Diana: Sometimes we even reach for a porcupine

00:25:05.928 --> 00:25:06.928
quill.

00:25:06.928 --> 00:25:11.918
It's just a very sharp, pointed tip that doesn't
dull quickly.

00:25:11.918 --> 00:25:14.638
So that's a really good one.

00:25:14.638 --> 00:25:16.788
What else?

00:25:16.788 --> 00:25:18.937
We have…

00:25:18.937 --> 00:25:21.977
Ellen: An agate burnisher, which has a stone

00:25:21.977 --> 00:25:27.317
at the end that can…if you rub it over a
fill, you can get it very, very smooth.

00:25:27.317 --> 00:25:32.107
So it's really handy for filling like losses
and gilding to gesso.

00:25:32.107 --> 00:25:33.107
Diana: Burnishing.

00:25:33.107 --> 00:25:34.107
Ellen: Burnishing.

00:25:34.107 --> 00:25:35.678
Diana: Different types of paint, you know,

00:25:35.678 --> 00:25:36.678
building.

00:25:36.678 --> 00:25:38.197
Ellen: Yeah, you sort of make paint look almost

00:25:38.197 --> 00:25:41.378
plasticky if you're doing work on a McCracken
something.

00:25:41.378 --> 00:25:43.408
Diana: It's great.

00:25:43.408 --> 00:25:48.438
Different types of scalpel blades are also
something we use a lot.

00:25:48.438 --> 00:25:56.178
We use this for all sorts of things, from
removing accretions, taking microscopic samples,

00:25:56.178 --> 00:25:57.178
things like that.

00:25:57.178 --> 00:25:59.307
So these are really great.

00:25:59.307 --> 00:26:01.577
Ellen: This one's so tiny.

00:26:01.577 --> 00:26:03.798
Is this one of the corneal scalpels?

00:26:03.798 --> 00:26:07.837
Diana: Yeah, so, for example, the scalpel

00:26:07.837 --> 00:26:14.028
is actually borrowed from probably eye surgery
tools.

00:26:14.028 --> 00:26:16.497
So that's really interesting.

00:26:16.497 --> 00:26:18.967
These tweezers, all day.

00:26:18.967 --> 00:26:22.447
Ellen: Yeah, tweezers are great.

00:26:22.447 --> 00:26:26.128
Diana: Tweezers, micro spatula and we have

00:26:26.128 --> 00:26:27.378
all kinds of sandbags.

00:26:27.378 --> 00:26:34.237
So we actually…this is for scuba diving
so we borrow a lot from different fields.

00:26:34.237 --> 00:26:39.327
So actually, in the comments below, if you
have any cool tool you think we should…

00:26:39.327 --> 00:26:40.778
Ellen: Oh, that's a good idea.

00:26:40.778 --> 00:26:42.298
Diana: …try out, let us know.

00:26:42.298 --> 00:26:44.638
Ellen: Yeah, that's a great idea.

00:26:44.638 --> 00:26:50.237
Oh, and I wanna say this is a tool I learned
from my colleague, Megan Randall, who learned

00:26:50.237 --> 00:26:52.798
it from another New Yorker conservator.

00:26:52.798 --> 00:26:56.898
It's actually to use a MetroCard to help finish
fills.

00:26:56.898 --> 00:26:58.817
It's got a very thin edge.

00:26:58.817 --> 00:27:06.138
You could almost use it like a blade, but
it's soft so it's not going to damage your

00:27:06.138 --> 00:27:08.938
substrate if it's prone to scratching.

00:27:08.938 --> 00:27:12.158
You can also use it for cleaning.

00:27:12.158 --> 00:27:19.788
I've used it to take gunk off of the top of
a box in an installation piece.

00:27:19.788 --> 00:27:27.957
It was just the right strength and thinness
to get the gunk off without damaging the surface.

00:27:27.957 --> 00:27:29.828
So yeah, this is one of my favorite tools.

00:27:29.828 --> 00:27:31.747
Diana: You could probably also cut it into

00:27:31.747 --> 00:27:37.098
weird shapes and then I'd stick it on to a
stick with some duct tape.

00:27:37.098 --> 00:27:39.258
Ellen: That's a really great invention.

00:27:39.258 --> 00:27:41.867
I think you're sitting on a million-dollar
idea.

00:27:41.867 --> 00:27:45.467
Diana: And then this is just an example of

00:27:45.467 --> 00:27:50.598
a palette we use with some gambling conservation
colors.

00:27:50.598 --> 00:27:56.117
We use all different types of paints, depending
on what we're working on.

00:27:56.117 --> 00:27:57.117
Ellen: Why is it gray?

00:27:57.117 --> 00:27:58.278
Diana: So it's gray.

00:27:58.278 --> 00:28:03.857
Gray kind of helps you see…it's not stark
white it helps you kind of see if you're putting

00:28:03.857 --> 00:28:06.178
white on top of a different color.

00:28:06.178 --> 00:28:13.518
You're gonna have different effects, Rayleigh
scattering, I think it's called so…

00:28:13.518 --> 00:28:14.518
Ellen: Rayleigh scattering.

00:28:14.518 --> 00:28:16.508
Diana: Rayleigh scattering, so you want…it's

00:28:16.508 --> 00:28:21.597
nice to use a gray palette and yeah, so this
is one example.

00:28:21.597 --> 00:28:30.347
We also have our everyday watercolor set.

00:28:30.347 --> 00:28:38.028
And these are great because they're quite
reversible and just water and you can use

00:28:38.028 --> 00:28:40.497
the tray as a palette itself.

00:28:40.497 --> 00:28:50.077
Ellen: Do you wanna ask...get some more questions?

00:28:50.077 --> 00:28:52.467
Diana: Yeah.

00:28:52.467 --> 00:28:59.357
Oh, this is a good question FF Boda asks,
"What are the main challenges of contemporary

00:28:59.357 --> 00:29:01.487
art conservation?"

00:29:01.487 --> 00:29:03.057
It's a really good question.

00:29:03.057 --> 00:29:04.057
Ellen: Yeah.

00:29:04.057 --> 00:29:11.207
Contemporary art conservation, as opposed
to more traditional forms of conservation.

00:29:11.207 --> 00:29:16.888
Well, first off, there are a lot more materials
since the Second World War.

00:29:16.888 --> 00:29:25.538
So we're dealing with a huge range of polymers
and plastics that really haven't been tested

00:29:25.538 --> 00:29:28.448
by time.

00:29:28.448 --> 00:29:32.908
We don't know how they're going to age and
how they get along with other materials.

00:29:32.908 --> 00:29:38.678
So the number of materials that we're responsible
for is infinitely larger than it would be

00:29:38.678 --> 00:29:44.237
for somebody working on objects from the early
20th century and before.

00:29:44.237 --> 00:29:48.317
Diana: Yeah, we're also dealing with…something

00:29:48.317 --> 00:29:53.638
that's really cool is the artists might still
be alive.

00:29:53.638 --> 00:30:01.008
And so documenting the artist's intent and
documenting just how the artist works might

00:30:01.008 --> 00:30:03.878
be part of our documentation process.

00:30:03.878 --> 00:30:07.678
Whereas before, obviously, that was impossible.

00:30:07.678 --> 00:30:13.518
So it's a really exciting time and I think
we're all kind of learning as we go.

00:30:13.518 --> 00:30:17.247
Ellen: Yeah, and the ethics aren't as cut

00:30:17.247 --> 00:30:18.247
and dry, right?

00:30:18.247 --> 00:30:19.247
Diana: Yeah.

00:30:19.247 --> 00:30:22.658
Ellen: We're not always trying to preserve

00:30:22.658 --> 00:30:23.658
the material.

00:30:23.658 --> 00:30:29.058
We're not as precious about the material as
we might have been for more traditional objects.

00:30:29.058 --> 00:30:34.217
Because there are some objects that demand
they be remade every time they're shown and

00:30:34.217 --> 00:30:39.548
there are others whose material is just disintegrating.

00:30:39.548 --> 00:30:50.337
So it's…it would be preferable in some cases
to actually remake or replicate than to preserve

00:30:50.337 --> 00:30:52.467
that material.

00:30:52.467 --> 00:30:56.867
Diana: Yeah, maybe like, for example, our

00:30:56.867 --> 00:31:06.058
colleague, Megan, was working on…Megan Randall
was working on a wax leg by Robert Gober,

00:31:06.058 --> 00:31:08.237
and I wasn't here at the time so I don't know
if you…

00:31:08.237 --> 00:31:09.237
Ellen: Right.

00:31:09.237 --> 00:31:13.548
The wax leg had little human hair sticking
out of it.

00:31:13.548 --> 00:31:17.918
And it goes into…the part of the installation
is it goes into a bathtub and bath water runs

00:31:17.918 --> 00:31:24.378
over it and the hairs, from the pressure of
the water, get dislodged and pulled out.

00:31:24.378 --> 00:31:32.538
So rather than fishing out those scuzzy hairs
in the bath and finding out where they came

00:31:32.538 --> 00:31:37.468
from and putting them back in place, it was
preferable from the Gober Studio and our curatorial

00:31:37.468 --> 00:31:42.328
team to replace that hair with a new hair
that they supplied Megan.

00:31:42.328 --> 00:31:47.597
And they... and someone from the studio came
and trained her on how to insert human hair

00:31:47.597 --> 00:31:53.148
into a wax leg and it was really disgusting.

00:31:53.148 --> 00:31:54.678
Diana: Yeah, so, I mean, that's something

00:31:54.678 --> 00:31:55.827
totally new.

00:31:55.827 --> 00:31:56.997
It's really fun.

00:31:56.997 --> 00:31:59.528
Ellen: Right, the learning curve is very steep,

00:31:59.528 --> 00:32:01.518
which is what makes it interesting.

00:32:01.518 --> 00:32:02.538
Diana: Yes.

00:32:02.538 --> 00:32:03.558
Ellen: Yeah.

00:32:03.558 --> 00:32:04.577
All right.

00:32:04.577 --> 00:32:10.938
We've got another live question here from
Cat, "How has conservation changed in your

00:32:10.938 --> 00:32:11.938
careers?

00:32:11.938 --> 00:32:14.197
Materials and techniques evolve.

00:32:14.197 --> 00:32:19.567
Have past conservators unknowingly done damage
to art?"

00:32:19.567 --> 00:32:26.817
Two great questions and the first one is related
to what we were just discussing, how there's

00:32:26.817 --> 00:32:28.518
all these new materials and techniques.

00:32:28.518 --> 00:32:36.058
I think we're lucky here at MoMA because we
have our science conservation department upstairs.

00:32:36.058 --> 00:32:40.748
And so if we have materials that we...that
come in with a new acquisition, we're not

00:32:40.748 --> 00:32:45.468
sure what they are how they might react, we
can send them up for analysis.

00:32:45.468 --> 00:32:52.268
And that can inform the materials we use and
our understanding of that artist's practice.

00:32:52.268 --> 00:32:58.858
Diana: Yeah, and also that the materials we

00:32:58.858 --> 00:33:03.597
use, because of new plastics and new resins
and things like that, like you were saying,

00:33:03.597 --> 00:33:10.788
we have such a broader choice when it comes
to like varnishing or when it comes to adhesive.

00:33:10.788 --> 00:33:15.977
And so I think that feeds into the second
question.

00:33:15.977 --> 00:33:22.548
I don't think it's fair to say that past conservators
did damage at all.

00:33:22.548 --> 00:33:27.628
I think they just didn't have the same tools
that we might have now.

00:33:27.628 --> 00:33:31.727
So they were doing their best at the time
with what they were...what they had around

00:33:31.727 --> 00:33:33.308
them to use.

00:33:33.308 --> 00:33:36.207
Ellen: Right, but yeah, as we said before,

00:33:36.207 --> 00:33:43.807
a lot of what we do is undoing past restoration
attempts that…where materials have failed

00:33:43.807 --> 00:33:45.097
and undoubtedly…

00:33:45.097 --> 00:33:46.847
Diana: That will happen.

00:33:46.847 --> 00:33:50.717
Ellen: We'll be on the other end of the equation

00:33:50.717 --> 00:33:52.008
in the future.

00:33:52.008 --> 00:33:55.308
Hopefully less and less as we learn more and
more.

00:33:55.308 --> 00:34:00.379
But at the same time, the materials are evolving
as our understanding of them is.

00:34:00.379 --> 00:34:02.228
So it's hard to keep up.

00:34:02.228 --> 00:34:07.108
Diana: But we try our best.

00:34:07.108 --> 00:34:11.188
Ellen: We try our best.

00:34:11.188 --> 00:34:15.057
Diana: Oh, this one's for Ellen.

00:34:15.057 --> 00:34:21.508
Alexis asks, and this is in regards to conserving
a Frank Lloyd Wright statue, "Okay, but what

00:34:21.508 --> 00:34:24.268
happened to her head restoration?"

00:34:24.268 --> 00:34:25.268
Rolling face.

00:34:25.268 --> 00:34:26.268
Ellen: Rolling eye emoji.

00:34:26.268 --> 00:34:27.608
Diana: Rolling eyes emoji.

00:34:27.608 --> 00:34:28.658
Ellen: Rolling face?

00:34:28.658 --> 00:34:30.508
Diana: So what did happen to her head?

00:34:30.508 --> 00:34:35.398
Ellen: Yeah, so yeah, Alexis Thomas is among,

00:34:35.398 --> 00:34:40.578
I think, several viewers who watched this
video that we posted about this Frank Lloyd

00:34:40.578 --> 00:34:42.258
Wright sprite with a missing head.

00:34:42.258 --> 00:34:45.008
And it was all about our restoration of this
headless sprite.

00:34:45.008 --> 00:34:48.318
But at the end of the video, we hadn't replaced
the head.

00:34:48.318 --> 00:34:53.018
We were focused on this crack system at her
midsection.

00:34:53.018 --> 00:35:00.818
And yeah, we never did replace the head and
that's because we were preparing this work

00:35:00.818 --> 00:35:06.958
for an exhibition that didn't really require
a perfect restoration.

00:35:06.958 --> 00:35:13.888
It was for "Frank Lloyd Wright at 150: Unpacking
the Archive."

00:35:13.888 --> 00:35:19.238
And so it's all about how the archive, Frank
Lloyd Wright's archive, came to MoMA in Columbia,

00:35:19.238 --> 00:35:24.088
and how we were interpreting the objects in
that archive as sort of raw data.

00:35:24.088 --> 00:35:27.278
So to the curator, Barry Bergdoll, it wasn't

00:35:27.278 --> 00:35:35.718
all that important that presenting this sprite,
we were presenting it as this entire piece

00:35:35.718 --> 00:35:44.788
because we received a lot of objects that
were in" So you can understand how a partial

00:35:44.788 --> 00:35:48.558
restoration might be acceptable in this presentation.

00:35:48.558 --> 00:35:53.138
But that's not to say that we won't restore
the head in the future.

00:35:53.138 --> 00:35:58.478
And I can imagine a lot of different types
of exhibitions where we would want to, like

00:35:58.478 --> 00:36:03.178
one about Midway Gardens, the project the
sprite came from.

00:36:03.178 --> 00:36:08.578
And how Frank Lloyd Wright worked with concrete
and how he cast concrete.

00:36:08.578 --> 00:36:14.358
In that sort of presentation, it might be
nice to show his intended results.

00:36:14.358 --> 00:36:19.018
Diana: But, if you were to restore the head,

00:36:19.018 --> 00:36:21.638
you wouldn't just invent a head right?

00:36:21.638 --> 00:36:28.158
You would look at a lot of documentation and
other sprites that still exist and…

00:36:28.158 --> 00:36:30.288
Ellen: Yeah, that's a good point.

00:36:30.288 --> 00:36:35.528
There is an abundance of historical evidence
of what that head looked like and other existing

00:36:35.528 --> 00:36:36.528
heads.

00:36:36.528 --> 00:36:42.308
So we could definitely use that, molds of
those head scans of those heads to inform

00:36:42.308 --> 00:36:49.028
how we recreate ours because this one sprite
came from…is one of 20 or so that came from

00:36:49.028 --> 00:36:50.738
the same mold.

00:36:50.738 --> 00:36:52.928
So that's lucky for us.

00:36:52.928 --> 00:36:53.928
Diana: Yeah.

00:36:53.928 --> 00:36:54.928
Ellen: If we didn't have any evidence of the

00:36:54.928 --> 00:36:59.038
head, then we might not attempt to restore
it, period.

00:36:59.038 --> 00:37:03.738
I have another live question.

00:37:03.738 --> 00:37:12.438
Enigma writes, "Is all of the work/restoration
due to age-related reasons?

00:37:12.438 --> 00:37:16.318
Do things ever happen because of accidents
or anything like that?"

00:37:16.318 --> 00:37:17.318
Diana: That's a really good question.

00:37:17.318 --> 00:37:21.358
Ellen: Is all restoration related to age reasons?

00:37:21.358 --> 00:37:23.418
Yes, yeah.

00:37:23.418 --> 00:37:25.488
Diana: Yeah.

00:37:25.488 --> 00:37:31.498
Ellen: I'd say, I don't know, a quarter of

00:37:31.498 --> 00:37:36.738
the works that come to our lab are because
of damages and not because of deterioration.

00:37:36.738 --> 00:37:41.508
Because of handling or something fell off
of its pedestal due to vibrations.

00:37:41.508 --> 00:37:45.088
Diana: Yeah, and sometimes age makes an artwork

00:37:45.088 --> 00:37:48.048
more susceptible to damage.

00:37:48.048 --> 00:37:49.878
So that's important to think about.

00:37:49.878 --> 00:37:54.148
But, yeah, sometimes we do have to fix careless
accidents.

00:37:54.148 --> 00:37:55.948
Ellen: Accidents.

00:37:55.948 --> 00:38:04.098
The euphemism we use is "visitor interaction"
for when a work has been damaged due to an

00:38:04.098 --> 00:38:09.228
overzealous visitor or a clumsy visitor who
was taking a selfie.

00:38:09.228 --> 00:38:12.768
Diana: Yeah, but that was that's a really

00:38:12.768 --> 00:38:15.478
good question.

00:38:15.478 --> 00:38:20.838
Ellen: Another live question from Devon Colley,

00:38:20.838 --> 00:38:25.258
"Are either of you and your colleagues practicing
contemporary artists?"

00:38:25.258 --> 00:38:26.258
No.

00:38:26.258 --> 00:38:32.238
"And if yes, does being a conservator positively
or negatively impact your art-making career?"

00:38:32.238 --> 00:38:37.058
Diana: Yes, so I was actually a painter before

00:38:37.058 --> 00:38:38.508
I became a conservator.

00:38:38.508 --> 00:38:39.508
Ellen: Really?

00:38:39.508 --> 00:38:42.208
Diana: Yes, I was an oil painter and…

00:38:42.208 --> 00:38:44.978
Ellen: Like, figurative or abstract?

00:38:44.978 --> 00:38:47.808
Diana: I would say figurative but surreal.

00:38:47.808 --> 00:38:48.858
Ellen: Cool.

00:38:48.858 --> 00:38:52.558
Diana: But the problem is I'm actually currently

00:38:52.558 --> 00:38:59.728
still a graduate student and the conservation
program is quite intense and you have to give

00:38:59.728 --> 00:39:01.018
a lot of your time to it.

00:39:01.018 --> 00:39:07.298
So in that sense, negatively affected my practice
because I just don't have time to paint.

00:39:07.298 --> 00:39:13.738
But I think after I've graduated this summer,
I will go back to making art.

00:39:13.738 --> 00:39:20.178
And I think I'll honestly keep doing what
I was doing before.

00:39:20.178 --> 00:39:23.128
Ellen: It's had no impact on you.

00:39:23.128 --> 00:39:26.308
Diana: It had no…it's…I think we learn

00:39:26.308 --> 00:39:33.858
a lot of traditional techniques during school
so we learn how certain paintings were made,

00:39:33.858 --> 00:39:35.448
how certain sculptures were made.

00:39:35.448 --> 00:39:40.358
And I think, yeah, maybe I'll have picked
up a little bit of that my own practice.

00:39:40.358 --> 00:39:49.028
But I know…yeah, I know other conservators
are really influenced by, say, old master

00:39:49.028 --> 00:39:50.028
artists.

00:39:50.028 --> 00:39:51.458
Ellen: Yeah, and I'm not an artist.

00:39:51.458 --> 00:39:57.728
I loved my studio art classes, I love working
with my hands and honing a skill.

00:39:57.728 --> 00:40:04.298
But I always had trouble with coming up with
a concept facing a blank page.

00:40:04.298 --> 00:40:09.138
That was never my strength and I don't have
any inclination to create in that way.

00:40:09.138 --> 00:40:17.448
So conservation is perfect because the art's
already there and I can work within that framing.

00:40:17.448 --> 00:40:21.488
But I think it has…I think conservation,
working conservation has impacted the way

00:40:21.488 --> 00:40:22.488
I view art.

00:40:22.488 --> 00:40:28.288
I think it makes it much harder just to appreciate
a painting or sculpture.

00:40:28.288 --> 00:40:35.618
If you can see the damages and knowledge of
the types of damages that can happen and how…what

00:40:35.618 --> 00:40:40.678
old restoration looks like, I think, really
I can't un-see that now when I look…

00:40:40.678 --> 00:40:41.678
Diana: Absolutely.

00:40:41.678 --> 00:40:43.798
Ellen: …at the work that has any sort of

00:40:43.798 --> 00:40:44.798
damage.

00:40:44.798 --> 00:40:46.348
Diana: Well, and I like that point.

00:40:46.348 --> 00:40:52.528
I think conservation, going through the program
and learning all about materials has really

00:40:52.528 --> 00:40:58.588
made me love modern and contemporary art so
much more than I did before.

00:40:58.588 --> 00:41:05.348
Because I'm so much more aware of the importance
of materials and the importance of different

00:41:05.348 --> 00:41:09.838
techniques and subtle things like that, that
I might not have noticed before.

00:41:09.838 --> 00:41:16.208
So when you're in a gallery next time, really
look at the materials and the choices the

00:41:16.208 --> 00:41:18.838
artist made on how they use those materials.

00:41:18.838 --> 00:41:19.998
Should we...?

00:41:19.998 --> 00:41:22.668
Ellen: Cool, yes, should wrap up?

00:41:22.668 --> 00:41:25.618
I think we're running out of time.

00:41:25.618 --> 00:41:30.728
Diana: Should we look at this last?

00:41:30.728 --> 00:41:34.378
Ellen: Oh, there's one more.

00:41:34.378 --> 00:41:35.838
Let's see.

00:41:35.838 --> 00:41:36.998
Oh, I see.

00:41:36.998 --> 00:41:38.288
This is from our producers.

00:41:38.288 --> 00:41:39.458
We're new at this.

00:41:39.458 --> 00:41:42.408
We don't understand that this was supposed
to be subtle and not read out loud.

00:41:42.408 --> 00:41:44.708
This is just a note to us.

00:41:44.708 --> 00:41:45.708
All right.

00:41:45.708 --> 00:41:50.848
We just wanna give a quick shout out to our
viewers tuning in across the U.S. and internationally.

00:41:50.848 --> 00:41:55.008
We have viewers from New York City, of course.

00:41:55.008 --> 00:41:56.398
Diana: South Carolina.

00:42:01.398 --> 00:42:02.398
Hi.

00:42:02.398 --> 00:42:03.398
Ellen: Very cool.

00:42:03.398 --> 00:42:04.948

that you think might be valuable to pre-program
students, anybody interested in conservation.

00:42:30.298 --> 00:42:32.888
Diana: If we forgot to say something…

00:42:32.888 --> 00:42:33.988
Ellen: We certainly we didn't...

00:42:33.988 --> 00:42:34.988
Diana: Definitely forgot.

00:42:34.988 --> 00:42:37.508
Ellen: We didn't mention the ECPN, Emerging

00:42:37.508 --> 00:42:41.268
Conservation Professional Network, which is
also a great thing to get involved in.

00:42:41.268 --> 00:42:43.308
Go to the AIC webpage.

00:42:43.308 --> 00:42:48.688
But yeah, any conservators watching, link
to resources below or any favorite books,

00:42:48.688 --> 00:42:54.108
anything you think that would be useful for
an emerging conservator.
