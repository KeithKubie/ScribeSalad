00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.279
Until about the 1970s, doctors used to inject
potentially pregnant women’s urine inside

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.580
female rabbits, and the rabbits would then
be killed to examine their ovaries and tell

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.510
if the woman was pregnant.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.310
What?!

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.090
Hello there children of pregnancy, Jules here
for DNews!

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.580
In 2008, Thomas Beatie, a man, gave birth,
not via c-section, to a healthy baby girl.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.009
His pregnancy was a pretty big deal; he was
on Oprah, became a public speaker, and later

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.550
gave birth to two more children.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.540
Beatie is one of a number of transgender men
who have elected to have a child.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.679
In 2014 in Australia alone, which is one of
the few countries to track such statistics,

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:47.399
Medicare reported 54 men who had given birth,
based on the gender noted in their medical

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.399
documentation.

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.899
But one of the many non-heartwarming reactions
to the Beatie story was that his pregnancy

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:58.209
did not “count”, because he was designated
female at birth and had a uterus, or a…

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:59.209
duderus.

00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:03.660
Thankfully, these inexplicably angry detractors,
are likely not medically trained professionals,

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.250
or they’d know that a uterus is by no means
necessary for forming babby.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.000
In fact, every one-in-ten thousand pregnancies
ends up with the fetus coming to term in the

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.720
abdomen, specifically the peritoneal (parrot-toe-neal)
cavity.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.720
This can happen when, after conception, the
egg moves towards the uterus but falls out

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.610
of the fallopian tube into the abdomen.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.030
There have even been cases of simultaneous
uterine AND abdominal pregnancies, which makes

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.700
the kids more like neighbors than womb-mates.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.890
Any pregnancy where the fetus develops outside
the uterus is known as “ectopic”, and

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.810
serves as a useful model for what happens
to babies born outside of standard conditions,

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.160
say, within a man’s abdomen.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.870
One fascinating take away is that these abdominal
pregnancies are more likely to result in a

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.950
female birth than a male one, by a ratio of
roughly 2 to 3.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.410
Turns out, male fetuses are much worse at
surviving an uncomfortable gestation environment,

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.950
although for both sexes, abdominal pregnancies
very rarely produce a live birth.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.780
Nonetheless, the fact that fetuses can develop
outside of the uterus has raised serious questions

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.129
about whether it would be possible for men
to have such an ectopic implantation.

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.950
And, it’s a tricky subject.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.849
On the one hand, a number of doctors say that
such an pregnancy would be completely possible:

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.959
the embryo would be implanted in the abdomen,
the placenta would attach to abdominal organs,

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.189
and delivery would be done by C-section.

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:26.569
Any missing pregnancy hormones could be supplemented
with injections.

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.349
But despite the theoretical capability, no
man, or woman, or any person, has yet to go

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.319
through with such an implantation, mainly
because, on its face, it is an incredibly

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:37.969
dangerous procedure.

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:42.299
One bioethicist explained that the question
wasn’t “Can a man do it”, but “Can

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:43.829
he survive it?”.

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:49.340
So for humans, the answer is pretty decidedly
“Yes, but in some cases, it might kill you.”

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.560
But forget about humans for a second… what
about seahorses?

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.069
Great question.

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.150
Seahorses are a member of the Syngnathidae
(sig-natha-die) fish family, most of which

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.709
display a fascinatingly unique form of pregnancy.

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.889
Male seahorses have a special pouch, or what
we can call a “womb”, on the front side

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:06.060
of their tails.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.989
When male and female seahorses mate, the female
deposits her eggs into the male’s pouch,

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.860
where they gestate for roughly one to six
weeks before the male “gives birth” to

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.069
a bunch of tiny seaponies.

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.311
Just kidding, they’re still called seahorses,
and the baby ones are called “Frys”, and

00:03:20.311 --> 00:03:24.359
also ponies aren’t baby horses anyway, a
pony is just a type of horse.

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:25.359
The more you know!

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:27.379
So, can men get pregnant?

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:30.829
Hell yes, they totally can, and some even
have.

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.700
But most don’t, since in most cases it’s
super dangerous, and it’s hard to see a

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.549
reason to do so unless you’re a bodybuilder
doctor trying to prove the effectiveness of

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.410
fertility drugs that the FDA won’t let you
test on women, so Danny DeVito convinces you

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.529
to test it out on yourself, and later you
become the Governor of California.

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:50.499
So men can get pregnant but do we really even
need women's eggs to get pregnant?

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:53.219
Can we just do it with sperm and like a toe
nail?

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:54.219
Maybe!

00:03:54.219 --> 00:04:09.049
Find out 
in this video.

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:13.730
So how do you think the world would be different
if men got pregnant on a regular basis?
