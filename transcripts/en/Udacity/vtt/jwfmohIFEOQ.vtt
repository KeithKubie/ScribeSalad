What have we learned about the behavior of exponential functions so far? Well,

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:09.460
once again, working with our general function, f of x equals a to the x. If a

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.010
is greater than 1, then f of x is increasing everywhere in this domain, showing

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:20.800
exponential growth. If 0 is less than a is less than 1, then the function looks

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.710
like this one. It's decreasing everywhere in its domain, and we say that it

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.580
shows exponential decay. There is, however, another way that functions of this

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.556
type are sometimes written out. I've graphed four different functions over

00:00:35.556 --> 00:00:38.850
here, and I'd like you to tell me which one is equivalent to the function we

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:46.960
were talking about before? f of x equals 1 3rd to the x. I'd like you to think

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.060
about this, using both equations I've written here and the graphs that are

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.320
drawn.
