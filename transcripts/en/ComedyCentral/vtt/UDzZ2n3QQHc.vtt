00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:02.716
(bassy hip hop)

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:09.179
- This is actually a very very important

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.725
Super Late Morning Show today.

00:00:10.725 --> 00:00:13.808
We're having a Ja Rule release party.

00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:16.921
He is not releasing an album

00:00:16.921 --> 00:00:18.838
because he's in prison.

00:00:19.917 --> 00:00:21.330
- So this is actually a release party

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.638
for him getting out of prison.

00:00:22.638 --> 00:00:24.927
We got Big Homie here
on the ones and twos.

00:00:24.927 --> 00:00:26.979
Know wham saying and you
know what, Big Homie,

00:00:26.979 --> 00:00:29.092
give us three seconds of
some Ja Rule right now.

00:00:29.092 --> 00:00:31.631
♫ Murda, holla holla

00:00:31.631 --> 00:00:33.864
All right, the reason we're
playing three seconds is cause

00:00:33.864 --> 00:00:36.963
legally we're only allowed
to play three seconds.

00:00:36.963 --> 00:00:39.178
- We play more than three
seconds we get sued.

00:00:39.178 --> 00:00:41.941
I'm not tryna go to jail for Ja Rule.

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:43.850
- Ladies and gentlement welcome
back to the Cipha Sounds

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.122
and Rosenberg show.

00:00:45.122 --> 00:00:46.794
Now we got some special guests here.

00:00:46.794 --> 00:00:48.280
- The Lucas brothers are here.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.467
- [Lucases] What's up.

00:00:49.467 --> 00:00:50.444
- Tell the people in New York City

00:00:50.444 --> 00:00:51.277
this party you have planned.

00:00:51.277 --> 00:00:53.618
- Okay, it's gonna be a
Ja Rule release party.

00:00:53.618 --> 00:00:55.802
- Wait he has a record coming out?

00:00:55.802 --> 00:00:57.570
- Nah, nah, he's getting
released from prison.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.691
- He's getting out of jail.

00:00:58.691 --> 00:01:00.154
- Because this is Hot 97,
if you come up to promote

00:01:00.154 --> 00:01:01.931
you know we're gonna keep it 100% real.

00:01:01.931 --> 00:01:03.662
No one's coming to this party.

00:01:03.662 --> 00:01:04.495
- Why would you say--

00:01:04.495 --> 00:01:06.456
- Do you not remember how
the Ja Rule story ended,

00:01:06.456 --> 00:01:08.865
he was really hot, and
then he went to jail,

00:01:08.865 --> 00:01:10.938
and then everyone forgot the
whole thing ever happened.

00:01:10.938 --> 00:01:12.755
- Yeah but the heat was still on him.

00:01:12.755 --> 00:01:15.042
I don't think the heat ever left.

00:01:15.042 --> 00:01:16.943
- The heat never leaves Ja Rule.

00:01:16.943 --> 00:01:18.142
Ja Rule leaves the heat.

00:01:18.142 --> 00:01:19.665
(dubby music)

00:01:19.665 --> 00:01:22.510
- So what's your favorite Ja Rule song?

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:23.343
- None.

00:01:23.343 --> 00:01:25.851
- What's your favorite Ja Rule song?

00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:26.684
- I don't have one.

00:01:26.684 --> 00:01:28.341
- So what's your favorite Ja Rule song?

00:01:28.341 --> 00:01:29.304
- I've never heard of him.

00:01:29.304 --> 00:01:31.133
- You know what, there was
one that he did I think

00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:34.558
with LL Cool J, where he
was talking about, um,

00:01:34.558 --> 00:01:35.391
cannabis

00:01:35.391 --> 00:01:36.680
and I think Ja Rule was on that.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.513
- 5 4 3 2 1.

00:01:37.513 --> 00:01:38.346
That was DMX.

00:01:38.346 --> 00:01:39.376
- That's a classic.

00:01:39.376 --> 00:01:41.358
- One of his great songs is Holla Holla,

00:01:41.358 --> 00:01:42.406
you rememeber that one?

00:01:42.406 --> 00:01:43.280
- No I don't know.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.396
- Oh, where are you guys from?

00:01:44.396 --> 00:01:45.229
- We are eh--

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:46.062
- We're from Spain.

00:01:46.062 --> 00:01:46.895
- Spain.

00:01:46.895 --> 00:01:47.900
So Ja Rule's international.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.533
- Can you do your best Ja Rule impression?

00:01:50.533 --> 00:01:52.158
- It's Ja Rule.
- Hi, I'm Ja Rule.

00:01:52.158 --> 00:01:53.322
- It's muuurda!

00:01:53.322 --> 00:01:56.913
- So we're having a Ja Rule
release from prison party.

00:01:56.913 --> 00:02:00.080
- I didn't even know he was in prison.

00:02:01.156 --> 00:02:03.864
♫ Baby girl put it on me

00:02:03.864 --> 00:02:06.880
- Look, you can't have the
world's greatest Ja Rule party,

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.125
unless you have a party expert.

00:02:09.125 --> 00:02:11.991
And we've got Andrew WK here for us.

00:02:11.991 --> 00:02:13.796
(partiers clap)

00:02:13.796 --> 00:02:14.693
- Happy to be here.

00:02:14.693 --> 00:02:16.554
- What's your favorite Ja Rule song.

00:02:16.554 --> 00:02:18.480
- I like Holla Holla.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.819
Is it Holla Holla or just Holla?

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.394
- It's Holla comma Holla.

00:02:22.394 --> 00:02:24.000
- Could you do a rap in his voice?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.077
- His voice is special.

00:02:25.077 --> 00:02:28.663
That's certainly part
of his trademark, so.

00:02:28.663 --> 00:02:32.830
There's a grit there (clears throat)

00:02:33.785 --> 00:02:36.758
♫ Holla holla hng--

00:02:36.758 --> 00:02:38.659
You know, I'm gonna leave it at that.

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.002
(clears throat)

00:02:40.002 --> 00:02:40.835
- That's the music.

00:02:40.835 --> 00:02:42.835
Time for Ja Rule trivia.

00:02:44.168 --> 00:02:46.708
- [Keith] So what is Ja
Rule's government name?

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:48.325
- Oh, his legal birth name.

00:02:48.325 --> 00:02:50.995
- [Keith] Government name, yeah.

00:02:50.995 --> 00:02:52.592
- Is it Antoine?

00:02:52.592 --> 00:02:55.262
- [Keith] Ja Rule's actual
name is Jeffrey Atkins.

00:02:55.262 --> 00:02:57.142
- [Kevin] All right, here'
question number two, Andrew.

00:02:57.142 --> 00:03:00.941
Which movie did Ja Rule
appear in with famous actor

00:03:00.941 --> 00:03:02.670
Orlando Jones, who was best known

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.539
for the 7UP Yours campaign?

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:05.982
- Is it Fast and Furious,

00:03:05.982 --> 00:03:07.729
one of the Fast and Furious movies?

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:09.842
- [Kevin] Not even close.

00:03:09.842 --> 00:03:11.254
It was Biker Boyz.

00:03:11.254 --> 00:03:12.292
Did you see Biker Boyz?

00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:13.125
- No.

00:03:13.125 --> 00:03:15.328
(slow mo) No.

00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:16.913
- All right, Andrew, you're 0 for two.

00:03:16.913 --> 00:03:18.630
That's all cool, because
if you nail this one,

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:19.777
you get two whole points.

00:03:19.777 --> 00:03:20.690
Last question.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.218
How many Grammy award
nominations has Ja Rule received?

00:03:24.218 --> 00:03:25.286
And you gotta remember,

00:03:25.286 --> 00:03:28.700
the Grammy awards recognize
excellence in music.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.200
(tense music)

00:03:36.053 --> 00:03:39.136
- I believe he's gotten at least two.

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:42.849
- Technically, yeah.

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:44.286
At least two, that was right.

00:03:44.286 --> 00:03:45.168
I win.

00:03:45.168 --> 00:03:47.918
(slow mo) I win.

00:03:49.101 --> 00:03:50.101
I get juice!

00:03:51.175 --> 00:03:52.327
I'mma keep it.

00:03:52.327 --> 00:03:54.410
- [Keith] That's it,
DJ, can you play us out?

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:55.435
- Holy cow. All right.

00:03:55.435 --> 00:03:56.268
♫ Murda

00:03:56.268 --> 00:03:57.202

♫ Girl put it on me

00:03:58.331 --> 00:03:59.483
- [Kevin] This is the greatest party ever.

00:03:59.483 --> 00:04:01.184
(bassy hip hop)

00:04:01.184 --> 00:04:02.606
- Man, I just wanted to take some time

00:04:02.606 --> 00:04:04.975
to congratulate my dude Ja Rule, man.

00:04:04.975 --> 00:04:06.267
He getting released man.

00:04:06.267 --> 00:04:07.598
Welcome home, baby.

00:04:07.598 --> 00:04:08.774
- My name is Richard Garcia,

00:04:08.774 --> 00:04:11.804
I'm a guy who looks a lot like 2Pac.

00:04:11.804 --> 00:04:13.699
I wanna give a shout out to Ja Rule,

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:15.818
when you come home for
your touchdown baby,

00:04:15.818 --> 00:04:17.051
you know what time it is.

00:04:17.051 --> 00:04:20.444
- Be well, enjoy yourself,
get well, stay well,

00:04:20.444 --> 00:04:23.361
and most of all, keep on Ja Rule'n!

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.170
