00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.290
A space elevator is one of those ideas that
sounds ultra crazy at first but when you learn

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.280
more about it, it still sounds absolutely
crazy but you can see the upsides.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.860
It’s exactly what it sounds like, a giant
elevator that you get in down here on earth

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.500
and step off of in freaking space.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.520
You’d need an anchor on earth which would
serve as the loading station for the elevator

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.970
car, a tether stretching into space for the
car to travel along, and a counterweight way

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.240
out in space to keep the tether taught.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.380
Designs vary but it looks like the counterweight
could have to be as far as 100,000 kilometers

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.840
above the earth, more than a quarter the distance
to the moon.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.219
Sounds nuts, but for some it’s not just
a pie in the sky idea, it’s something they’re

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:43.790
actively working towards.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.040
In September of 2018 researchers from Shizuoka
University in Japan launched an experiment

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.559
to the ISS to test the practicality of one
aspect of a space elevator.

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.600
The experiment involves two tiny cubic satellites
connected by 10 meters of cable, with a small

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.020
container moving along the cable with a motor.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.869
It’s a far cry from a full fledged space
elevator, but the goal was to show that locomotion

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.700
along a cable in space was possible.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.869
The experiment is in collaboration with the
construction firm Obayashi, which six years

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.229
prior announced plans to build a space elevator
by 2050.

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.649
They’re not the only ones toying with the
idea; China intends to build one by 2045,

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.810
and NASA has commissioned studies to look
into how feasible the idea is.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.909
But hold up, why all the fuss about space
elevators to begin with?

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.810
What’s wrong with good old chemical powered
rockets?

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.319
Well while we have rocket technology right
now to lift payloads and people into space,

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:39.299
It’s extremely costly.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.979
According to SpaceX, It costs roughly $2,700
to put one kilogram of cargo into low earth

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:45.979
orbit.

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:54.090
An elevator to space would be a massive construction
project, but by one estimate, once built,

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.289
could cost as little as $200 to get one kilogram
into space.

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.350
Meaning I would only need $13,000 to get off
this planet, as opposed to $175,000.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.353
Obayashi estimates it would cost about $90
billion to make a space elevator, but compared

00:02:04.353 --> 00:02:05.353
to the cost of conventional rockets it would
recoup that once it had lifted about 4.5 thousand

00:02:05.353 --> 00:02:06.353
tonnes, which is about the weight of 11 International
space stations.

00:02:06.353 --> 00:02:09.950
A space elevator would open up so many possibilities,
like building and launching ships in orbit.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:10.950
Hello Starfleet.

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.230
It could make trips to Mars less fuel intensive,
because a ship could plummet towards Earth

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.040
like an Olympic high diver, using Earth’s
gravity to boost it on to the red planet.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.000
Tourists could make trips up regularly.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.980
Just get in, listen to girl from Ipanema,
make awkward small talk for a few thousand

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.739
kilometers and get the selfie of a lifetime.

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.310
Flat Earthers could finally see what we have
been trying to explain to them all along!

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.079
There is literally no reason not to do this!

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.930
Except that we can’t do it yet.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.420
Sure, we could build many of the components
with the materials we have today, like the

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.470
anchor on earth, the counterweight out in
space, and the elevator car itself.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.970
But the actual tether that holds the whole
thing together, that makes it a space elevator,

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.930
is an extreme challenge.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.719
As of today there’s no material strong and
light enough to stretch 100,000 kilometers

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:00.719
into space.

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:03.549
That’s almost 2 and a half times earth’s
circumference.

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.109
The material has to be resistant to weather,
radiation, and orbital debris.

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:12.829
The closest thing to that right now are carbon
nanotubes, which can be 100 times stronger

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:13.829
than steel.

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:18.049
But they’re difficult to make longer than
a few centimeters, which is about 100,000

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.719
km short of the goal.

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:23.640
Still, Japanese scientists are committed to
building a lift to the heavens, and the first

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.579
stop will be proving a elevator car can travel
along a 10 meter cable in space.

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:32.709

where else are you going to learn about more

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.930
cool nanocarbon structures like schwarzites.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.830
This video, that’s where.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.530
Carbon nanotubes were discovered by a Japanese
researcher, and their expertise is part of

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.360
why they are more dedicated to building a
space elevator than most other countries.
