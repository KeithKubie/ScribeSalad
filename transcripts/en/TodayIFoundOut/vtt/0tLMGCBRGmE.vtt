00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:02.520
Why do we Get Ice Cream Headaches

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.549
If you’ve ever found yourself wondering
what causes ice cream headaches, well wonder

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:07.549
no more.

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:11.780
While many theories on what exactly causes
ice cream headaches or “brain freezes”

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.209
have existed for some time, it has only been
very recently that it was discovered exactly

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:17.540
what is going on here.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.030
It turns out, ice cream headaches are a result
of a rapid change in the size of blood vessels

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.870
as a response to an extreme shift in temperature
in the roof of the mouth, particularly the

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.980
back of the roof of the mouth.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.800
Specifically, what is happening here is that
when you stick something extremely cold in

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.089
your mouth and eat it quickly, such as drinking
an ice cold beverage or eating ice cream rapidly,

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:40.699
it rapidly cools the palate of your mouth.

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:45.430
Why this is significant is that there is a
nerve center located just above the back of

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.430
the roof of your mouth.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.039
This nerve center includes nerve clusters
that send signals to the brain about changes

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:52.500
in body temperature.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.239
When these nerve clusters are rapidly cooled
by what you are consuming, they are over stimulated

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.499
and send the message to the brain that the
body just lost a severe amount of heat.

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:05.300
This ends up resulting in the rapid contraction
of blood vessels in your head.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.100
Shortly thereafter, the temperature at the
palate of your mouth goes back to normal and

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.939
the nerve centers signal everything is fine
and the blood vessels end up rapidly dilating.

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:18.100
This all can happen in a matter of a few seconds,
but the end result of this rapid contraction

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.359
and dilation of blood vessels is an extreme,
sharp pain, often in your temples, forehead,

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:26.109
or sometimes even in your face itself.

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:30.360
This ends up creating a very similar pulsing
sensation that many people experience when

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.729
they get true migraine headaches.

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.450
Migraine headaches can even be induced by
cold temperatures in some people, leading

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.409
some researches to believe there is a close
connection between what is happening during

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.310
certain types of migraine headaches and what
is happening during an ice-cream headache.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.271
Bonus Facts:
• The scientific name for an ice cream headache

00:01:48.271 --> 00:01:51.070
is “sphenopalatine ganglioneuralgia”.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.719
This basically just means “nerve pain of
the sphenopalatine ganglion”.

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:01.229
• Not that most ice-cream headaches last
very long, typically at most 10-30 seconds

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.360
(though there have been documented instances
of these headaches lasting as much as five

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.850
minutes), but if you want to have an ice cream
headache go away a little bit faster, most

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.470
doctors suggest simply pressing your tongue
against the roof of your mouth.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.880
This will help heat up the palate a little
faster than it would have otherwise, which

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.110
will reduce the time needed for the ice cream
headache to go away.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.440
Alternatively, you can just consume the cold
item much slower to prevent the ice cream

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.530
headache completely.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.220
This gives the palate a chance to keep its
temperature regulated enough that the nerve

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.700
center above it doesn’t overreact to what
it’s sensing.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.520
• While most people at one point or another
in their lives has experienced an ice cream

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.870
headache, these headaches are only somewhat
common in about 1/3 of humans.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.520
• The oldest documented form of something
resembling ice cream being served is from

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.600
200 BC in China.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.030
Here they served a frozen mix of milk and
rice.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.850
Yet another early frozen treat reference was
from Rome around the year 50 when the Emperor

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.080
Nero would have ice crushed and mixed with
fruit toppings.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.680
The first actual ice cream references, in
terms of something closely resembling modern

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.480
day ice cream, comes from a recipe in an 18th
century publication called Mrs. Mary Eales’s

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.190
Receipts in London.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.880
• One of the major developments in spurring
the popularity of ice cream was the development

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.540
of soft serve ice cream in the 20th century.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.640
This method of making ice cream was developed
by a team of chemists in Britain, whose membership

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.320
included Margaret Thatcher.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.600
They found a way to double the amount of air
per unit volume in ice cream.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.550
This, in turn, made the ice cream cheaper
to make (less ingredients, more air), and

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:48.390
made it possible to have a relatively simple
machine make it to order from a spigot.
