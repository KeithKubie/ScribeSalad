00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.096
The two places

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.600
where I feel most free

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.936
aren't actually places.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.400
They're moments.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.760
The first is inside of dance.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.576
Somewhere between
rising up against gravity

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.096
and the feeling that the air beneath me

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.800
is falling in love with my body's weight.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.696
I'm dancing and the air is carrying me

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.440
like I might never come down.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.776
The second place that I feel free

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.896
is after scoring a goal
on the soccer pitch.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.536
My body floods with the chemical

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.656
that they put inside of EpiPens
to revive the dead,

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.720
and I am weightless,

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.480
raceless.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.896
My story is this: I'm a curator
at a contemporary arts center,

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.200
but I don't really believe in art
that doesn't bleed or sweat or cry.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.616
I imagine that my kids
are going to live in a time

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.720
when the most valuable commodities
are fresh water and empathy.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.976
I love pretty dances
and majestic sculpture

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.656
as much as the next guy,

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.880
but give me something else to go with it.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.136
Lift me up with the aesthetic sublime

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.856
and give me a practice or some tools
to turn that inspiration

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.960
into understanding and action.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.136
For instance, I'm a theater maker
who loves sports.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.416
When I was making
my latest piece /peh-LO-tah/

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.056
I thought a lot about how soccer
was a means for my own immigrant family

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.896
to foster a sense of continuity
and normality and community

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.360
within the new context of the US.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.296
In this heightened moment of xenophobia
and assault on immigrant identity,

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.896
I wanted to think through

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.976
how the game could serve
as an affirmational tool

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.496
for first-generation Americans
and immigrant kids,

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.936
to ask them to consider
movement patterns on the field

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.240
as kin to migratory patterns
across social and political borders.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.376
Whether footballers or not,

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.880
immigrants in the US
play on endangered ground.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.736
I wanted to help the kids understand

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.616
that the same muscle
that they use to plan the next goal

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.800
can also be used
to navigate the next block.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.680
For me, freedom exists in the body.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.016
We talk about it abstractly
and even divisively,

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.816
like "protect our freedom,"
"build this wall,"

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.840
"they hate us because of our freedom."

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.816
We have all these systems
that are beautifully designed

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.536
to incarcerate us or deport us,

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.600
but how do we design freedom?

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.856
For these kids, I wanted to track the idea
back to something that exists inside

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.256
that no one could take away,

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.016
so I developed this curriculum

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.976
that's part poli-sci class,
part soccer tournament,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.440
inside of an arts festival.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.896
It accesses /peh-LO-tah/'s
field of inquiry

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.816
to create a sports-based
political action for young people.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.536
The project is called
"Moving and Passing."

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.696
It intersects curriculum development,
site-specific performance

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.616
and the politics of joy,

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.776
while using soccer as a metaphor
for the urgent question

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.160
of enfranchisement among immigrant youth.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.896
Imagine that you are
a 15-year-old kid from Honduras

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.696
now living in Harlem,

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.616
or you're a 13-year-old girl born in DC
to two Nigerian immigrants.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.976
You love the game.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.816
You're on the field with your folks.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.256
You've just been practicing
dribbling through cones

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.536
for, like, 15 minutes,

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.440
and then, all of a sudden,
a marching band comes down the field.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.096
I want to associate the joy of the game
with the exuberance of culture,

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.616
to locate the site of joy in the game

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.176
at the same physical coordinate

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.056
as being politically informed by art,

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.440
a grass-laden theater for liberation.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.056
We spend a week

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.616
looking at how the midfielder
would explain Black Lives Matter,

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.815
or how the goalkeeper
would explain gun control,

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:38.016
or how a defender's style
is the perfect metaphor

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.776
for the limits of American exceptionalism.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.856
As we study positions on the field,

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.000
we also name and imagine our own freedoms.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.456
I don't know, man, soccer is, like,

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.016
the only thing on this planet
that we can all agree to do together.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.160
You know? It's like the official sport
of this spinning ball.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.096
I want to be able
to connect the joy of the game

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.376
to the ever-moving footballer,

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.536
to connect that moving footballer

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.040
to immigrants who also moved
in sight of a better position.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.376
Among these kids, I want
to connect their families' histories

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.056
to the bliss of a goal-scorer's run,

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.096
family like that feeling
after the ball beats the goalie,

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.000
the closest thing going to freedom.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.216
Thank you.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.720
(Applause)
