00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.637
So let's try adding one more rule. So now

00:00:02.637 --> 00:00:05.250
we'll ask the quiz again. But this time our

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.780
grammar has two rules. So now we have two

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.530
rules. We have the rule we had before, which

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.850
allows us to replace word with counter-word. And we're

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.900
going to add one more rule. It says we already

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.300
know one word. We know the word hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia. So

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.020
now the question is, how many words can we make?

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.990
The possibilities are none, one, two, or infinitely many.
