00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160
[laughter]

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.280
[more laughter]

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.160
We think comedy is just about a relaxing laugh,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.860
but the job of a comic is, in fact, deeply serious and important

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.960
to the mental well being and flourishing of a society.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.500
In the olden days, they were called "jesters,"

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.120
officially licensed and salaried comics,

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.740
whose explicit job it was to make jokes for the king

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.760
as a way of drawing them back to the things that really mattered,

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.060
and saving them from errors of pomposity.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.320
This suggests that comedy might be a requirement--

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.100
a bit like having your teeth checked, or doing the accounts--

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.100
not some optional extra when you feel like watching a bit of TV.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.400
There are a host of things that comedy helps us with.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.400
For a start, it's a medicine against despair.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.740
A lot of humor picks up on the darkest things in our lives--

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.860
death, anxiety, failure--

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.620
but rather than reconciling us to them, it helps us to feel cockily defiant and strong about them.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.640
Consider Velazquez's rendition of the dying Christ.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.640
Then turn to Monty Python's comedic take on the same situation.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.040
--Crucifixion, mm? Good. Out of the door, lying on the left, one cross each.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.000
A comic attitude doesn't deny misery, but it has a very different relationship with it.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.940
--Ah man, I shot Marvin in the face.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.360
Comedy can be infused with a mood of defiance.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.200
One's gonna laugh at rather than buckle in front of the miseries of existence.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.340
In Monty Python's "The Life of Brian," the closing song brazenly states the worst of our existence.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.580
The mood is mocking; there is a refusal to be gloomy.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.100
In 1940, when Britain was in a very precarious military situation,

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.780
a song mocking the Nazi leaders became wildly popular.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.000
The enemy's power was all too terrifyingly apparent; the point was simply to keep them cheerful,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.460
and defiant was centrally important to the task of just keeping them going.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.060
By mocking dangerous things, humor can embolden us;

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.640
it paints what's potentially very frightening as helpfully ridiculous.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.920
Comedy is also a great remedy for a sense of humiliation.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.280
Life is filled with things which deeply threaten our dignity.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.400
We're never far from being reduced to complete mockery.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.120
In the children's television series, "Peppa Pig,"

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.460
a father, Daddy Pig, is always doing things that could be seen as absurd, humiliating, or embarrassing.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.600
In the opening sequence, he makes a loud, rather obnoxious grunt.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.500
He's overweight; he can come across as lazy.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.820
It would be extremely easy to make a very negative assessment of his character.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.160
That's the kind of thing we tend to do for ourselves and other people:

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.300
we regularly rehearse the case for the prosecution.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.880
In cartoons, though, this very flawed creature

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.080
is presented as somehow both flawed and extremely lovable.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.780
His wife and children are deeply attached to him.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.900
They do see him as a bit of an idiot; it's just that they love him as he is.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.980
In their eyes, he is a lovable fool.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.500
That's what a lot of comedy helps us with:

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.560
it turns people, ourselves included--

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:23.220
people who could just be seen as idiots in normal life-- into those far more valuable characters: lovable fools.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.000
If we happen to walk down a road and saw a man called Basil Fawlty bashing his car with a branch of a tree,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.260
we'd feel he was just some awful, furious bloke venting his anger in a crazed, destructive way.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.280
We'd judge him a thoroughly unpleasant fool.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.440
Fortunately, for Basil Fawlty, he's not in real life, but in a comedy by John Cleese

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.880
and therefore, he isn't just an idiot.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.800
He's that classic comedic character: a lovable fool.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.220
His vices are introduced alongside some deeply ingratiating qualities.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.040
The show teaches us to really like someone whom in real life, we might have cursed.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.440
It's a remarkable achievement on the part of the comedy team,

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.420
akin to what Jesus did when he got us to think lovably about criminals and low-lives.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.640
Comedy produces benevolent stereotypes.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.700
If someone says, "You're a bit of a Woody Allen," it's a benign alternative to saying,

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.660
"You're a deeply annoying over intellectual worrier."

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.500
--You-u-u're like New York Jewish, left-wing liberal intellectual, Central Park West, Brandeis University

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.700
uh, socialist summer camps and uh-h the father with the Ben Shahn drawings, right?

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.660
Woody Allen's taught us to look more kindly on the foibles of people

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.420
we'd otherwise risk calling neurotic wimps.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.320
It's the reverse of bad stereotyping,

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.160
in which we make a problem worse by emphasizing how deeply awful certain people are.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.440
Comic characters always hold on to our sympathy.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.880
--ACHOO!

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.880
To say that a work colleague is a bit of a David Brent

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.160
isn't merely to point out that they're tactless and insecure--

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.700
it's also to re-frame those failings.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.940
Because we come to feel tender towards David Brent as well as laughing at him,

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.020
we see his vulnerability, not just his idiocy.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.420
We get good at recognizing that it's his anxiety about not being like or respected

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.560
that leads him to do all those deeply embarrassing things.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.180
Larry David is always getting angry and abusive.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.600
He's incredibly combative and rude. He gets into huge arguments all the time.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.820
And yet, he's sort of charming.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.020
--What's not to like?

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.740
So, once again, with the help of comedy,

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:32.720
we're re-framing an otherwise tempting but wholly negative stereotype: grumpy old man.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:39.100
The comic move is to guide us to a benevolent conception of people, and hence, parts of ourselves.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.560
Comedy also does a great job at reducing power imbalances.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.220
It's hugely reassuring to see the powerful laughing at themselves.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.040
Finding oneself comical is a token of maturity;

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.040
it means being able to see one's faults without being too defensive about it.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.000
Humor often provides a mechanism where by the powerless, or at least, the less powerful,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.380
can give constructive but pointed feedback to the powerful.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.520
Monty Python was particularly focused on this task.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.120
"The Philosophers' Football Match" mocks the great figures of intellectual history.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.860
It's funny because we've been intimidated so deeply in the past by intellectual bullies,

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.740
we made us feel small with our reading of Wittgenstein or Schopenhauer.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:27.920
And now they're shown as being completely rubbish at football, and yet seriously involved in the game.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.360
Comedy isn't just a bit of fun.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.620
The comic perspective is a central need of a society.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:38.060
It enables us to cope much better with our own follies and disappointments,

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.820
our troubles around work and love, and our difficulties enduring ourselves.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:47.920
Comedy is waiting to be re-framed as a central tool in a better society.
