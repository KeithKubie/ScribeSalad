00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.380
Logistic regression predicts
the probability of the outcome

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.420
variable being true.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.550
In this example, a
logistic regression model

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.230
would predict the
probability that the patient

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.220
is receiving poor care.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.620
Or if we denote the
PoorCare variable

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.800
by y, the probability
that y = 1.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.870
For the remainder
of this lecture,

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:36.440
we will denote poor care by
1, and good care by zero.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.860
So, since the outcome
is either 0 or 1,

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.790
this means that the probability
that the outcome variable is 0

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.580
is just 1 minus the probability
that the outcome variable is 1.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.930
So by predicting the
probability that y = 1,

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.400
we also get the
probability that y = 0.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.430
Just like in linear
regression, we

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.770
have a set of independent
variables, x1 through xk,

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.789
where k is the total number of
independent variables we have.

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:14.060
Then to predict the
probability that y = 1,

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.610
we use what's called the
Logistic Response Function.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.850
This seems like a complicated,
nonlinear equation,

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.980
but you can see the
familiar linear regression

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.070
equation in this Logistic
Response Function.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.039
The Logistic
Response Function is

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:35.460
used to produce a
number between 0 and 1.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.930
Let's understand this
function a little better.

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.410
This plot shows the
logistic response function

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.080
for different values of the
linear regression piece.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.240
The logistic response
function always

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.300
takes values between 0
and 1, which makes sense,

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.150
since it equals a probability.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.470
A positive coefficient
value for a variable

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.370
increases the linear
regression piece,

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.940
which increases the
probability that y = 1,

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.770
or increases the
probability of poor care.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.060
On the other hand, a
negative coefficient value

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.960
for a variable decreases
the linear regression piece,

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.560
which in turn decreases
the probability that y = 1,

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.200
or increases the
probability of good care.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.420
The coefficients, or
betas, are selected

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.500
to predict a high probability
for the actual poor care cases,

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.780
and to predict a low probability
for the actual good care cases.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.040
Another useful way to think
about the logistic response

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.120
function is in terms of
Odds, like in gambling.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.250
The Odds are the
probability of 1

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.980
divided by the probability of 0.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.960
The Odds are greater than 1 if 1
is more likely, and less than 1

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.770
if 0 is more likely.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.690
The Odds are equal to 1 if the
outcomes are equally likely.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.680
If you substitute the
Logistic Response Function

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.470
for the probabilities
in the Odds

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.050
equation on the
previous slide, you

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.590
can see that the Odds
are equal to "e" raised

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.110
to the power of the linear
regression equation.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.310
By taking the log of both
sides, the log(Odds),

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.620
or what we call the
Logit, looks exactly

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.570
like the linear
regression equation.

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.780
This helps us understand how the
coefficients, or betas, affect

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.730
our prediction of
the probability.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.520
A positive beta value
increases the Logit,

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.000
which in turn increases
the Odds of 1.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.550
A negative beta value
decreases the Logit,

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.430
which in turn, decreases
the Odds of one.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.740
In the next video, we'll build a
logistic regression model in R,

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.610
and predict the quality of care.
