00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.260
SCENES LIKE THIS ARE A DAILY REALITY FOR
THE CREW OF SEEKER ON THEIR PACIFIC TREK.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.600
SOME ESTIMATES HOLD THAT BY 2050, THERE COULD
BE AS MUCH PLASTIC AS THERE ARE FISH

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.240
IN THE OCEAN.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.080
BUT WHAT IS ALL THIS JUNK, EXACTLY?

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.600
WHERE DOES IT COME FROM?

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.400
AND IS IT REALLY CONCENTRATED IN A GIANT ‘GARBAGE PATCH’ SOMEWHERE OUT THERE?

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.140
MARCUS ERIKSEN IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENTIST
WHO HAS MADE IT HIS LIFE’S MISSION TO SOLVE

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.120
THE PROBLEM OF MARINE PLASTIC.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.540
IT’S A GLOBAL ISSUE, BECAUSE PLASTIC ACCUMULATES IN GYRES,

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.040
LARGE CIRCULAR CURRENTS THAT THREAD
THROUGH THE WORLD’S OCEANS.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.680
What's leaving land heading out to sea is
all the single-use packaging: it's the straws,

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.860
the bags, the bottles, the cup lids, the stir
sticks, all this junk that we use once

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:24.930
and throw away.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.640
A plastic bottle leaving California will get
to Japan in about three to five years and

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.100
come back across the northern half 
of the North Pacific.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.600
That spinning mass of water is a gyre.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.580
Plastic trash will migrate to those zones
and get stuck.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.520
We actually take boats out in the middle of
nowhere, we drag our net behind the boat

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.020
and we count the plastic particles that are floating.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.440
Working with ocean modelers, we can get these
regional maps of how much trash is out there,

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.800
what it is and where it is.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.400
BUT ANSWERING EVEN THESE BASIC QUESTIONS ABOUT MARINE DEBRIS

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.200
HAS PROVEN TO BE SURPRISINGLY CHALLENGING.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.960
IN FACT, EVERYTHING WE KNOW ABOUT THE PROVERBIAL ‘GREAT PACIFIC GARBAGE PATCH’

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.260
STARTED IN 1990, WHEN A CONTAINER SHIP SPILLED 61,000 SNEAKERS INTO THE OCEAN.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.280
Realizing that a lot of these sneakers would
never come to shore, that they would would just

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.800
be stuck in this vortex, Curtis Ebbesmeyer, working with
James Ingraham Jr. at NOAA,

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.540
they’re the ones that came up with the term 
'Great Pacific Garbage Patch.'

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.780
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE IS OFTEN CREDITED WITH
THE FIRST OBSERVATIONS OF THE PATCH,

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.680
A CONSTELLATION OF MICROPLASTIC PARTICLES THAT CAPTURED THE PUBLIC’S IMAGINATION.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.060
Captain Charles Moore had described the area:
he said, 'Look, I'm in an area roughly twice

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.540
the size of Texas where I'm doing my transects'
and that hit the media by storm.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.320
There aren't these islands of trash; 
they don't exist.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.880
It's more like a smog of microplastic particles,
billions of them, very toxic over a wide area.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.400
EVEN WHEN THEY BECOME BRITTLE AND BREAK APART, PLASTIC PIECES PERSIST.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.680
UNABLE TO OXIDIZE OR BECOME WATERLOGGED LIKE
METALS, WOOD OR PAPER, ALL TYPES OF PLASTIC

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.300
ARE DESIGNED TO DEFEAT NATURAL DECAY.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.740
In general, high density polyethylene, number
two plastic, is the most common plastic

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:25.320
in consumer use, and it makes your soap bottles,
it makes your toothbrushes, it makes many

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.160
of the consumer goods that float out in the
garbage patch.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.920
If we think in terms of all the plastic that’s
been produced since 1950, since it’s a synthetic

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.640
material, hydrocarbons, it’s probably still
here today on the planet.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.980
DR. SARAH-JEANNE ROYER WORKS WITH 
DR. NIKOLAI MAXIMENKO

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.220
AND HIS TEAM AT THE UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.660
TO TACKLE THE PROBLEM OF TRACKING TRASH.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.780
Most of the time, we will find only bottle
caps and not the bottle itself

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.000
because the bottle is made out of PET.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.260
It's sinking because the density of PET is
higher than seawater.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.580
DESPITE THE DRAMATIC AMOUNT OF PLASTIC THE
CREW OF SEEKER HAS ENCOUNTERED,

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:12.599
SOME ESTIMATES HOLD THAT 99% OF OCEAN-BOUND PLASTIC WASTE IS STILL UNACCOUNTED FOR.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.680
THAT’S WHY SARAH’S TEAM IS WORKING WITH
THE SWIM EXPEDITION

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.120
AND THE OCEAN VOYAGES INSTITUTE TO TAG AND TRACK THE WASTE THEY FIND.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.880
The Swim are using two different protocols.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.480
The first protocol is a visual survey of all
marine debris they see from the vessel itself.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.400
Whenever they find an object that is large
enough, they will get closer to the debris,

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:37.499
they will take pictures of it.

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:41.979
If there are numbers or lettering, they will
share this information with us, so we can

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:45.039
track back the origin of that debris.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:52.140
The second protocol is basically to attach
a GPS buoy onto a marine debris

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.760
to track their movement in 
the ocean.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.740
ONCE THE TRACKER IS ACTIVATED, IT ENABLES
SCIENTISTS TO BOTH IMPROVE MODELS

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.780
OF HOW TRASH TRAVELS &nbsp;IN THE OCEAN, AND LEARN WHERE TO FOCUS CLEANUP EFFORTS.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.140
MOST OF THE TIME, SARAH AND HER TEAM CAN’T

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.480
IMMEDIATELY TELL WHERE A PIECE OF PLASTIC COMES FROM.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.440
BUT THEY CAN LOOK FOR OTHER CLUES.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.040
We need to use an FTIR or micro-Raman spectroscopy.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:30.260
This spectrum is matching a spectrum that is found in the library telling us what is the type of plastic.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:35.080
It's probably the dream of all scientists
to have a satellite and a new instrumentation

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.720
to be able to quantify the amount of plastic 
floating at sea.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.280
THE ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE OF PLASTIC IS POISONOUS.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.620
ITS MANUFACTURING PROCESS DEPENDS ON HARMFUL CHEMICALS, AND WHEN RELEASED

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.820
INTO THE ENVIRONMENT, IT SOAKS UP EVEN MORE TOXINS, AND TRANSPORTS THEM FAR AND WIDE…

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.180
INCLUDING INTO OUR BODIES.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.620
PLASTIC CAN CHOKE THE OCEAN’S ABILITY

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.280
TO ABSORB CO2 FROM THE ATMOSPHERE,
EXACERBATING CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.949
Only 10 percent of the habitat is on land.

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:07.840
The rest, 90 percent of the habitat's in the
ocean, and it’s totally unexplored

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.160
for the most part.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.800
Imagining all the jungles, all
the deserts, all the savannas,

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.720
all the Rocky Mountains... the ocean would be nine times more.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:25.680
The idea that somehow it could be 50 percent
plastic, 50 percent fish in a mere 30 years

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.600
is horrifying.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.900
BUT THE SITUATION IS FAR FROM HOPELESS.

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:47.210
ORGANIZATIONS ARE DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO CLEAN UP OCEAN PLASTIC.

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:51.089
MATERIALS SCIENTISTS ARE TURNING THEIR ATTENTION TO NEW PACKAGING SOLUTIONS.

00:06:51.089 --> 00:06:54.680
AND CONSUMERS ARE MAKING MORE INFORMED CHOICES EVERY DAY.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.900
How can we use our science to influence laws and policymakers?

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:04.860
When you refuse the single-use plastics, it
has an effect on your neighborhood,

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.300
on your local watershed, and the ocean.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:13.080
Now, seeing the UN talking about it, seeing
companies rise up and say, ‘We're going zero waste.’

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.700
To see countries make a commitment to stop
the flow of trash from land to sea...

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.900
I feel optimistic that we can solve this problem.
